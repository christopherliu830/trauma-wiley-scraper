AB  - Objectives: Immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) is a severe disease for which evidence is lacking to make informed choices regarding immunosuppressive regimen. The aims of the current study were to determine the effect of different treatment regimens on outcome in affected animals and to identify parameters that may be used as prognostic factors for the disease. Methods: The records of dogs presenting to a veterinary hospital in the period 2002 to 2010 for treatment of IMHA were examined and follow-up data were obtained. Statistical tests were performed to establish whether treatment regimen affected outcome and to identify prognostic factors for outcome. Results: Treatment regimen had a significant effect on the outcome (measured as survival of hospitalisation) but there were insufficient subjects to determine the cause of the difference. Serum bilirubin and urea concentrations were found to be significant negative prognostic factors for the outcome of IMHA cases and the concentrations of these parameters were significantly different between animals that survived or died while hospitalised. Clinical Significance: This study presents the first report of a significant difference in outcome comparing animals treated with immunosuppressive drugs which are in widespread clinical usage. Although possible confounding factors should be considered, these findings could have major consequences for the treatment of IMHA.

AB  - Objective? To evaluate the effect of perioperative and operative variables on survival time in dogs with aortic body tumors. Study Design? Retrospective study. Sample Population? Twenty-four client-owned dogs with histologically confirmed aortic body tumor. Methods? Seventy-eight patient records of dogs seen at the University of Illinois Veterinary Teaching Hospital between 1989 and 1999 with a diagnosis of a heart-base mass were reviewed. Dogs without histologic conformation of an aortic body tumor were excluded. Age; sex; breed; the presence of pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or abdominal effusion; evidence of cardiac arrhythmias; evidence of distant metastasis; treatment with pericardectomy; treatment with chemotherapy; and time from diagnosis until euthanasia or death were recorded on a spreadsheet. Cox proportional-hazard ratios were used to calculate the relationship of risk variables to survival time. Median survival time was determined using life-table analysis. Results? Twenty-four dogs met the criteria for inclusion in the study. The median age of dogs with aortic body tumors was 9 years. All dogs had a surgical biopsy performed. Fourteen dogs had a pericardectomy at the time of the biopsy procedure. Of all factors analyzed, only treatment with pericardectomy had a significant influence on survival (P= .0029). Dogs that had pericardectomy survived longer (median survival, 730 days; range, 1?1,621 days) compared with dogs that did not have pericardectomy (median survival, 42 days; range, 1?180 days). This finding was independent of the presence or absence of pericardial effusion at the time of surgery. Clinical Relevance? Dogs that are diagnosed with aortic body tumors may benefit from a pericardectomy at the time of surgical biopsy.

AB  - In this report we describe a primary giant cell tumor (GCT) of soft tissues located in the left dorsal wrist of a 52-year-old man. Plain radiographs did not reveal any lesion in his carpal or hand bones. Although the tumor was clinically considered a ganglion initially, the microscopic features were identical to those found in classic GCT of bone. Light microscopy showed a lesion composed of a homogeneously mixed proliferation of spindle and polygonal mononucleated stromal cells and evenly distributed multinucleated, osteoclast-like giant cells. Whereas most bone tumors have an extraosseous counterpart, only 13 cases of GCT in soft tissues had been published until 1998. Moreover, 64 new cases have been reported in three series. Nevertheless, most major reviews and textbooks do not consider this tumor as a specific entity and regard it as a low grade variant of malignant GCT of soft tissue. We describe the clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical features of this rare benign neoplasm emphasizing the differential diagnosis with its malignant soft tissue counterpart, an ominous tumor.

AB  - As is well known, Freud described the clinical practice of psychoanalysis as the ?loam? of his cultural-theoretical work, an assessment which is shared by many psychoanalysts up to the present, including the authors of this paper. The complex interplay between unconscious phantasies on the one hand, and the real experiences arising from the new possibilities opened up by prenatal diagnostics on the other, is described with reference to a report of an intensive, long psychoanalysis with an analysand from a family burdened with a genetically transmitted illness (haemophilia). The holding and containing function of the analyst enabled this analysand, despite traumatic experiences with the miscarriage of a healthy child triggered by a prenatal diagnosis and the later abortion of a haemophiliac baby, nevertheless to have the courage to go through another pregnancy and give birth to a healthy girl. The intensive clinical investigation of the unconscious phantasies, conflicts and traumas around the prenatal diagnostics proved to be not only therapeutically fruitful for the analysand, Ms F. It also facilitated insights into those individual chances and risks which appear to be an integral part of the opportunities presented by todays prenatal diagnostics and, through them, it lead to a cultural-critical look at the ambivalence of medical-technical progress. These insights, which are only attainable through psychoanalysis, can represent a distinctive contribution of psychoanalysis to a multi-disciplinary dialogue with medical practitioners, geneticists, ethicists and health policy-makers. By referring to a large EU study on ?Ethical Dilemmas due to Prenatal and Genetic Diagnostics?, this paper gives a practical example of such a discussion. Ms F. was psychoanalytically interviewed as part of this study, 16 years after the conclusion of her analysis. The summary of these interviews, which is set against the account of the treatment, offers an impressive insight not only into the long-term effects of a psychoanalysis under very particular personal circumstances, but also into the lasting consequences of decisions made in the context of prenatal diagnostics. Finally, the results of the individual case study are brought together with the clinical outcomes of the EU study, and some considerations are formulated concerning the protective and risk factors facing women during and after prenatal diagnostics. The paper is an appeal to psychoanalysts, with their specific competence in dealing with unconscious phantasies and conflicts and their high level of professionalism in dealing with traumatised patients, to get involved in fresh dialogue with prenatal diagnosticians and their patients.

AB  - Abstract Background: The aim of the present study was to retrospectively determine the clinical factors affecting the outcome after birth in prenatally diagnosed sacrococcygeal teratomas (SCT). Methods: Six cases of prenatal SCT were identified from January 1985 until August 2005. A retrospective review of case-notes and pathological reports was carried out. Clinical data during the perinatal period, operative findings, postoperative complications and follow up were evaluated in the patients with prenatally diagnosed SCT. Results: SCT presented as type I in two neonates and type III in four between 22 and 33?weeks? gestation. Fetal intervention was not performed for any fetus. Five of six were delivered by cesarean section and the other was delivered vaginally due to small tumor size. Patients were born at between 29 and 39?weeks? gestation and weighed from 1840 to 3500?g. All patients with type III SCT presented with related diseases, including bilateral hydronephrosis, neurological deficit of the communicating peroneal nerve such as paralytic talipes equines, bladder or bowel dysfunction, high-output cardiac failure, or fetal hydrops in one of a set of fraternal twins. A baby with high-output cardiac failure and fetal hydrops underwent urgent cesarean section at 29?weeks? gestation and died 8?days after birth despite intensive care due to multi-organ failure. In five cases, surgery was successful with good outcomes maintained at follow-up of between 8?months and 14?years. Conclusions: Detailed ultrasound should be performed to rule out associated anomalies, and determine the presence or absence of hydrops in prenatally diagnosed SCT. Fetal hydrops, orthopedic impairment such as lower extremity weakness and swelling, and urinary incontinence are important clinical factors affecting the outcome after birth in prenatally diagnosed SCT. In particular, the present study indicated that the association of a fraternal twin and fetal hydrops makes it very difficult to treat SCT perinatally.

Autopsies constitute a valuable feedback to the healthcare chain to achieve improvements in quality of care and cost effectiveness. This review describes post-mortem imaging, which has emerged as an important part of the pathology toolbox. A broad range of visualization aspects within post-mortem imaging are covered. General state-of-the-art overviews of the components in the visualization pipeline are complemented by in-depth descriptions of methods developed by the authors and our collaborators. The forensic field is represented and related to, as it is spearheading much development in post-mortem imaging. Other topics are workflow, imaging data acquisition, and visualization rendering technology. All in all, this review shows the mature state of visual analysis for a non- or minimal-invasive investigation of the deceased patient.

AB  - Summary Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affects 1% pregnancies and is multi-factorial in origin. The role of the acquired thrombophilia antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) as a common and potentially treatable cause of RPL is well established but this is less so for inherited thrombophilia. In obstetric APS the combination of aspirin and heparin has improved outcomes. By analogy, the use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has become commonplace in women with inherited thrombophilia and also those with unexplained miscarriage to help safeguard the pregnancy. This review will examine the pathophysiological role of thrombophilia in pregnancy loss, and the evidence for anticoagulant-based intervention. The limited data supporting the use of heparin for women with RPL and inherited thrombophilia suggests adoption of a more cautious and judicious approach in this setting.

AB  - Summary Mental illness exerts a major burden on human health, yet evidence-based treatments are rudimentary due to a limited understanding of the underlying pathologies. Clinical studies point to roles for the immune system in psychiatric diseases, while basic science has revealed that the brain has an active and multi-cellular resident immune system that interacts with peripheral immunity and impacts behavior. In this perspective, we highlight evidence of immune involvement in human psychiatric disease and review data from animal models that link immune signaling to neuronal function and behavior. We propose a conceptual framework for linking advances in basic neuroimmunology to their potential relevance for psychiatric diseases, based on the subtypes of immune responses defined in peripheral tissues. Our goal is to identify novel areas of focus for future basic and translational studies that may reveal the potential of the immune system for diagnosing and treating mental illnesses

AB  - Summary Endocrine causes of hypertensive emergencies are easily overlooked when patients present with uncontrolled hypertension in association with evidence of end-organ damage. Emergencies arising from hypertensive crises due to pheochromocytoma can be particularly dangerous. To ensure appropriate therapeutic counter-measures and a favorable outcome, the presence of a catecholamine-producing tumor should be distinguished from more common etiologies as well as other uncommon endocrine causes, such as primary hyperaldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, and thyrotoxicosis. However, diagnosis at the time of the emergency can be made difficult by activation of the sympathoadrenal system resulting from the physiological stress of the clinical condition. Tests of catecholamine excess are therefore rendered problematic to interpret, with reliable diagnosis often only possible once and if the patient recovers. Because of this and time delays in obtaining test results, recognition of a possible endocrine cause in the emergency setting requires careful attention to patient history, presentation, and precipitating causes that may provide clues to underlying etiologies to guide therapeutic interventions.

Simple rules need to be considered when defining the care strategy for these patients. Simple rules: ?? Establish at pre-hospital care and delivery system ?? Recognize the ?at risk? patient or injury pattern ?? Rule out and/or account for other major sources of bleeding ?? Control other sources of bleeding, if possible ?? Resuscitate to a ?tolerable? blood pressure ?? Blood product replacement: RBCs, platelets and FFP ?? Provisionally stabilize the pelvis ?? pelvic binder or sheet ?? ipsilateral femoral traction, in some cases ?? Emergent external fixation? ?? Stop arterial bleeding ?? Angiography and selective embolization ?? Exploration and direct pelvic gutter packing ?? Don?t be fooled by a positive FAST from an extra-peritoneal bladder rupture ?? an ex-lap for a retroperitoneal bleed can be fatal ?? To the TICU for continued resuscitation ??

AB  - Summary.? von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a common autosomally inherited bleeding disorder associated with mucosal or trauma-related bleeding in affected individuals. VWD results from a quantitative or qualitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a glycoprotein that is essential for primary haemostasis and that carries and protects coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) in the circulation. Through characterization of the phenotype and identification of mutations in the VWF gene in patients with VWD, understanding of the genetics and biochemistry of VWF and VWD has advanced considerably. The importance of specific regions of VWF for its interaction with other components of the vasculature has been revealed, and this has facilitated the formal classification of VWD into three subtypes based upon quantitative (types 1 and 3) and qualitative (type 2) deficiency of VWF. The underlying genetic lesions and associated molecular pathology have been identified in many cases of the qualitative type 2 VWD variants (2A, 2B, 2M, 2N) and in the severe quantitative deficiency, type 3 VWD. However in the partial quantitative deficiency, type 1 VWD, the picture is less clear: there is a variable relationship between plasma levels of VWF and bleeding, there is incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity within affected families, the causative molecular defect is unknown in a substantial number of cases, and even in those cases where the causative mutation is known, the associated molecular pathology is not necessarily understood. This guideline aims to provide a framework for best laboratory practice for the genetic diagnosis of VWD, based upon current knowledge and understanding.

AB  - SUMMARY Despite advances in surgical tools and techniques and the development of rapid transport systems to highly specialized medical centers, mortality rates from exsanguination due to injuries sustained in military and civilian trauma have not improved appreciably in the last 150 years. Scientists and clinicians, motivated by the promise of new hemorrhage control adjuncts, have recently increased research and development in an effort to combat this problem. This review describes the epidemiology of hemorrhagic death in both the military and civilian populations, the research implications of these injury patterns, and some of the most promising products ? whether already in use or under evaluation ? for the control of bleeding. A survey of fibrinogen-based products, recombinant factor VIIa, antifibrinolytic agents, products containing poly-N-acetyl glucosamine and other novel agents are presented. Preclinical and clinical data of products are outlined and the physical properties, mechanisms of action, and safety issues for each hemorrhage-control agent are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Keratinocytes and fibroblasts isolated from dysplastic oral lesions were combined to provide a renewable source of epithelia. A dysplasia-scoring index was devised to compare the architectural and cytological features and used together with robust immunophenotyping to show that the engineered epithelia showed most of the characteriztics of the clinical lesions. The strains of dysplastic oral keratinocytes with an extended or immortal lifespan provided a reproducible resource of epithelia showing mild (DOK), moderate (POE9n) or severe (D20) dysplasia when maintained under defined conditions. The dysplasia score was influenced by growth conditions, with KGF polarizing proliferation to the basal layer and reducing the severity of dysplasia. When compared to the normal counterparts, dysplasia-associated fibroblasts expressed MMP9, secreted more HGF, increased the dysplasia score for epithelia generated with mortal dysplastic keratinocytes and induced morphological changes in normal keratinocytes, highlighting the role of the microenvironment in determining the phenotype of dysplastic epithelia.

AB  - Abstract We report a case of a 76-year-old man presenting with a 12-month history of a solitary lesion on his scalp. The histopathology was consistent with a grade 2/3 osteosarcoma extending to the subcutis. Full-body imaging excluded any involvement of the underlying bony tissue or solid organ malignancy, thus a diagnosis of primary cutaneous osteosarcoma (PCO) was made. Given the exceedingly rare nature of PCO, we discuss the clinico-pathological features of this case and those previously reported in the literature.

AB  - Abstract. The purpose of the present study was to examine and compare the different mineralized tissues that are found on and around the dental root following treatment of different periodontal pathosis. The material has been compiled from previously published experimental studies on periodontal therapies and trauma treatments. 4 distinctly different appearances of the mineralized tissue layers on the marginal dentin surfaces were described; new cementum, non-attached bone-like tissue, partly attached bone-like tissue and ankylosis preceded by root resorption. It was concluded that, healing in the periodontal/root interface following periodontal therapy may yield different mineralized tissues, depending on a number of host-specific and external factors. The temporal pattern of such healing processes is schematically represented.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare isoflurane and propofol for maintenance of anesthesia and quality of recovery in client-owned dogs with intracranial disease undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Study design Prospective, randomized, clinical trial. Animals Twenty-five client-owned dogs with intracranial pathology, 13 females and 12 males, ages 11 months to 13 years, weighing between 3.0 and 48.0 kg. Methods Each dog was randomly assigned to receive propofol or isoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia. All dogs were not premedicated, were administered propofol intravenously to effect for induction, intubated and mechanically ventilated to maintain an end-tidal carbon dioxide tension 30?35 mmHg (4.0?4.7 kPa). Temperature and cardiac output were measured pre- and post-MRI. Scores for mentation, neurological status, ease of maintenance, and recovery were obtained pre- and post-anesthesia. Pulse oximetry, end-tidal gases, arterial blood pressure, heart rate (HR) and requirements for dopamine administration to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg were recorded throughout anesthesia. Results End-tidal isoflurane concentration was 0.73 ± 0.35% and propofol infusion rate was 292 ± 119 ?g kg?1 minute?1. Cardiac index was higher, while HR was lower, with propofol than isoflurane in dogs younger than 5 years, but not in older dogs. Dogs maintained with isoflurane were 14.7 times more likely to require dopamine than propofol dogs. Mentation and maintenance scores and temperature were not different. MAP and diastolic arterial pressure were higher in the propofol group. Recovery scores were better with propofol, although times to extubation were similar. Change in neurological score from pre- to post-anesthesia was not different between treatments. Conclusions Dogs maintained with propofol during MRI had higher arterial pressures, decreased requirements for dopamine, and better recovery scores, compared to dogs maintained with isoflurane. Clinical relevance Propofol anesthesia offered cardiovascular and recovery advantages over isoflurane during MRI in dogs with intracranial disease in this study.
