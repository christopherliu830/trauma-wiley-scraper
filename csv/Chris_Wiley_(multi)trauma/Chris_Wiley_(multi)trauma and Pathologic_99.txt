AB  - Abstract Objective To compare isoflurane and propofol for maintenance of anesthesia and quality of recovery in client-owned dogs with intracranial disease undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Study design Prospective, randomized, clinical trial. Animals Twenty-five client-owned dogs with intracranial pathology, 13 females and 12 males, ages 11 months to 13 years, weighing between 3.0 and 48.0 kg. Methods Each dog was randomly assigned to receive propofol or isoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia. All dogs were not premedicated, were administered propofol intravenously to effect for induction, intubated and mechanically ventilated to maintain an end-tidal carbon dioxide tension 30?35 mmHg (4.0?4.7 kPa). Temperature and cardiac output were measured pre- and post-MRI. Scores for mentation, neurological status, ease of maintenance, and recovery were obtained pre- and post-anesthesia. Pulse oximetry, end-tidal gases, arterial blood pressure, heart rate (HR) and requirements for dopamine administration to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg were recorded throughout anesthesia. Results End-tidal isoflurane concentration was 0.73 ± 0.35% and propofol infusion rate was 292 ± 119 ?g kg?1 minute?1. Cardiac index was higher, while HR was lower, with propofol than isoflurane in dogs younger than 5 years, but not in older dogs. Dogs maintained with isoflurane were 14.7 times more likely to require dopamine than propofol dogs. Mentation and maintenance scores and temperature were not different. MAP and diastolic arterial pressure were higher in the propofol group. Recovery scores were better with propofol, although times to extubation were similar. Change in neurological score from pre- to post-anesthesia was not different between treatments. Conclusions Dogs maintained with propofol during MRI had higher arterial pressures, decreased requirements for dopamine, and better recovery scores, compared to dogs maintained with isoflurane. Clinical relevance Propofol anesthesia offered cardiovascular and recovery advantages over isoflurane during MRI in dogs with intracranial disease in this study.

AB  - Summary Mental illness exerts a major burden on human health, yet evidence-based treatments are rudimentary due to a limited understanding of the underlying pathologies. Clinical studies point to roles for the immune system in psychiatric diseases, while basic science has revealed that the brain has an active and multi-cellular resident immune system that interacts with peripheral immunity and impacts behavior. In this perspective, we highlight evidence of immune involvement in human psychiatric disease and review data from animal models that link immune signaling to neuronal function and behavior. We propose a conceptual framework for linking advances in basic neuroimmunology to their potential relevance for psychiatric diseases, based on the subtypes of immune responses defined in peripheral tissues. Our goal is to identify novel areas of focus for future basic and translational studies that may reveal the potential of the immune system for diagnosing and treating mental illnesses

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective Therapeutic options for dental trauma depend on the injuries' features. For patients with uncomplicated tooth fractures, adhesive materials and composite partial veneers may be a therapeutic solution that completely preserves healthy tooth structure. Clinical considerations An ultra-conservative approach, using indirect composite partial veneers to restore fractured anterior teeth is described in these case reports. Conclusion Despite the position of the finish line in the middle of the clinical crown, this solution offers functional and esthetic outcomes using an indirect composite technique, and appears to be a suitable alternative to direct composite restorations or less conservative indirect veneers. Clinical Significance Indirect composite partial veneers present considerable advantages, such as ultra-minimally invasive properties and excellent esthetic appearances. The success seems to depend on a combination of sound adhesive principles, adequate design of the restoration, laboratory experience, and cementation techniques.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Environmental factors are poorly understood in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. The importance of environmental factors in gene environment interactions (GxE) is suggested by wide individual differences in cognitive loss, even for carriers of AD-risk genetic variants. Results and Discussion We propose the ?AD exposome? to comprehensively assess the modifiable environmental factors relevant to genetic underpinnings of cognitive aging and AD. Analysis of endogenous and exogenous environmental factors requires multi-generational consideration of these interactions over age and time (GxExT). New computational approaches to the multi-level complexities may identify accessible interventions for individual brain aging. International collaborations on diverse populations are needed to identify the most relevant exposures over the life course for GxE interactions.

AB  - Abstract There is a growing awareness that complement plays an integral role in human physiology and disease, transcending its traditional perception as an accessory system for pathogen clearance and opsonic cell killing. As the list of pathologies linked to dysregulated complement activation grows longer, it has become clear that targeted modulation of this innate immune system opens new windows of therapeutic opportunity for anti-inflammatory drug design. Indeed, the introduction of the first complement-targeting drugs has reignited a vibrant interest in the clinical translation of complement-based inhibitors. Compstatin was discovered as a cyclic peptide that inhibits complement activation by binding C3 and interfering with convertase formation and C3 cleavage. As the convergence point of all activation pathways and a molecular hub for crosstalk with multiple pathogenic pathways, C3 represents an attractive target for therapeutic modulation of the complement cascade. A multidisciplinary drug optimization effort encompassing rational ?wet? and in silico synthetic approaches and an array of biophysical, structural and analytical tools has culminated in an impressive structure-function refinement of compstatin, yielding a series of analogues that show promise for a wide spectrum of clinical applications. These new derivatives have improved inhibitory potency and pharmacokinetic profiles and show efficacy in clinically relevant primate models of disease. This review provides an up-to-date survey of the drug design effort placed on the compstatin family of C3 inhibitors, highlighting the most promising drug candidates. It also discusses translational challenges in complement drug discovery and peptide drug development and reviews concerns related to systemic C3 interception.

AB  - SUMMARY Despite advances in surgical tools and techniques and the development of rapid transport systems to highly specialized medical centers, mortality rates from exsanguination due to injuries sustained in military and civilian trauma have not improved appreciably in the last 150 years. Scientists and clinicians, motivated by the promise of new hemorrhage control adjuncts, have recently increased research and development in an effort to combat this problem. This review describes the epidemiology of hemorrhagic death in both the military and civilian populations, the research implications of these injury patterns, and some of the most promising products ? whether already in use or under evaluation ? for the control of bleeding. A survey of fibrinogen-based products, recombinant factor VIIa, antifibrinolytic agents, products containing poly-N-acetyl glucosamine and other novel agents are presented. Preclinical and clinical data of products are outlined and the physical properties, mechanisms of action, and safety issues for each hemorrhage-control agent are discussed.

AB  - Abstract There is long-standing debate about whether elevated dissociative symptoms are common in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or whether there is a distinct subtype of cases with elevated dissociation. The current investigation examined the latent structure of dissociative symptoms in a sample of 316 male, trauma-exposed Vietnam veterans, 76 of whom were diagnosed with current PTSD. Three taxometric procedures (MAMBAC, MAXEIG, and MAXCOV) were performed on three indicator sets drawn from the Dissociative Experiences Scale. Taxometric analyses consistently revealed a taxon (subtype) of highly dissociative individuals. The taxon members had significantly more severe posttraumatic symptoms and were more often diagnosed with current PTSD than were non-taxon members. Among participants with a current PTSD diagnoses, only 32% belonged to the dissociative taxon, suggesting that there is a subtype of severe PTSD with elevated dissociation.

AB  - Abstract The impact of work related stressors on emergency clinicians has long been recognized, yet there is little formal research into the benefits of debriefing hospital staff after critical incidents, such as failed resuscitation. This article examines current models of debriefing and their application to emergency staff through a review of the literature. The goal being, to outline best practice, with recommendations for guideline development and future research directives. An electronic database search was a conducted in Ovid and Psychinfo. All available abstracts were read and a hand search was completed of the references. Included articles were selected by a panel of two experts. Models and evidence relating to their efficacy were identified from the literature, and detailed evaluation included. The reviewed literature revealed a distinct paucity regarding the efficacy of debriefing of clinicians post CI and in particular randomized controlled trials. Despite this debriefing is perceived as important by emergency clinicians. However evidence presents both benefits and disadvantages to debriefing interventions. In the absence of evidence based practice guidelines, any development of models of debriefing in the emergency healthcare setting should be closely evaluated. And future research directives should aim towards large randomized control trials.

AB  - Summary A 27-year-old Thoroughbred mare presented for computed tomography (CT) of the head following a 3-month history of facial swelling at the infraorbital foramen, unilateral self-mutilation and head-shaking. Standing CT imaging showed soft tissue attenuation surrounding the infraorbital canal, with extensive bony lysis of the canal and maxillary bone at the infraorbital foramen. The mare was subjected to euthanasia, and post-mortem examination revealed a proliferative tan soft tissue mass overlying the infraorbital nerve. A histopathological diagnosis of pleomorphic sarcoma with giant cells was made. Immunohistochemical analysis failed to fully elucidate the mesenchymal cell of origin of the sarcoma. Pleomorphic sarcoma with giant cells involving the infraorbital canal of the horse has not been previously described. This case highlights chronic subtle behavioural changes attributable to this neoplasm prior to the development of clinical signs and the utility of advanced imaging in the diagnosis.

AB  - Background Free tissue transfers performed in patients with hematological diseases represent significant challenges for micro-surgeons. There are rare literatures that address the outcome in these patients. Therefore, we collected our database, analyzed the outcome, reliability, and related-management of microsurgical technique in the patients with hematological diseases. Methods A retrospective chart review of 20 patients with hematological disorders who received free tissue transfers during 20-years period in a single microsurgical center was done. Eleven patients who received head and neck reconstruction were found to have hyperfibrinogenemia. Seven patients with reactive thrombocytosis after trauma, and two patients with leukemia had soft tissue defects in the upper and lower extremities. Twenty-six flaps were used for free tissue transfers. Intra-operatively all patients received intravenous 5,000 Ud of heparin post immediate reperfusion. Anti-coagulant medication such as Dextran-40 or prostaglandin-E1 (PGE1) was given postoperatively. Results Twenty-three of the 26 free flaps survived without vascular compromise. Intra-operatively all patients received intravenous 5,000 Ud of heparin post immediate reperfusion, and anti-coagulant medication such as Dextran-40 or prostaglandin-E1 was given to the patients postoperatively. The three failed cases were found in patients with hyperfibrinogenemia and needed further reconstruction with another flap. The overall success rate was 88.5% (23/26). Conclusions Hematologic disorder is not a predicted factor of free flap failure. The key factors for success flap survival in patients with hematologic disorders include preoperative knowledge of the medical condition and monitoring potential post-operative complications, aggressive hematologist consultations, and meticulous non-traumatic surgical anastomosis. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The Quebec platelet disorder is a serious bleeding disorder associated with proteolysis of α-granular proteins, including fibrinogen. We evaluated fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) assays as screening tests for this disorder. Patients with the Quebec platelet disorder (13/13) had elevated serum FDPs (P?<0.01) due to secreted degraded platelet fibrinogen, but normal plasma FDPs and D-dimers. Unrelated controls with bleeding disorders (32/34) had undetectable FDPs, and controls with FDPs due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and other illnesses (11/11) had elevated FDPs in all assays (P?<?0.01). Immunoblot analyses indicated plasma fibrinogen was normal in the Quebec patients and platelet FDPs were found in their platelet lysates, releasates and serum samples. Their platelet FDPs were not altered by treatment with fibrinolytic inhibitors and were different from the FDPs in DIC and in plasmin-digested fibrinogen. Tests for serum FDPs may provide a simple rapid way to screen for the Quebec platelet disorder.

Two-thirds of the cases involve the membranous part of the septum. In the absence of an interventricular shunt or concomitant cardiac surgery, guidelines for surgical intervention or resection of isolated aneurysms of the membranous septum are not well established. In this report, we discuss a multi?imaging modality approach for the diagnosis and assessment of membranous ventricular septal aneurysms and review the experts' consensuses for follow-up and treatment strategies.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Innovations are necessary to accommodate the increasing demands on emergency departments whilst maintaining a high level of patient care and safety. Radiographer Preliminary Image Evaluation (PIE) is one such innovation. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of radiographer PIE in clinical practice within an emergency department over 12 months. Methods A total of 6290 radiographic examinations were reviewed from 15 January 2016 to 15 January 2017. The range of adult and paediatric examinations incorporated in the review included the appendicular and axial skeleton including the chest and abdomen. Each examination was compared to the radiologist's report this allowed calculated mean sensitivity and specificity values to indicate if the radiographer's PIE was of a true negative/positive or false negative/positive value. Cases of no PIE participation or series? marked as unsure for pathology by the radiographer were also recorded. This allowed mean sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy to be calculated. Results The study reported a mean ± 95% confidence level (standard deviation) for sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, no participation and unsure of 71.1% ± 2.4% (6.1), 98.4% ± 0.04% (0.9), 92.0% ± 0.68% (1.9), 5.1% (1.6) and 3.6% (0.14) respectively. Conclusions This study has demonstrated that the participating radiographers provided a consistent PIE service while maintaining a reasonably high diagnostic accuracy. This form of image interpretation can complement an emergency referrer's diagnosis when a radiologist's report is unavailable at the time of patient treatment. PIE promotes a reliable enhancement of the radiographer's role with the multi-disciplinary team.

AB  - Summary This chapter features representative imaging examples of commonly encountered pathological processes involving the digestive, hepatobiliary, pancreatic, and lymphatic systems, together with those that affect the peritoneal compartment. It provides an insight into abdominal imaging, highlighting commonly seen and major pathological processes through the lens of radiology, covering a broad array of organ systems. The ?surgical? sieve represents an approach to forming a cohesive list of diagnoses and differential diagnoses when presented with a clinical or imaging scenario.
