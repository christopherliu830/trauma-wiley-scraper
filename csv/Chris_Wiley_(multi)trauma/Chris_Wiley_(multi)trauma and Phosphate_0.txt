AB  - Summary A 5-year old, neutered, male, domestic sable ferret presented 24 hours after escaping outside and sustaining unknown trauma. Physical examination findings included tachycardia, tachypnea, and hind limb paresis in a laterally recumbent patient. Radiographs, laboratory evaluation, and abdominocentesis revealed the presence of hemoperitoneum, blunt hepatic trauma, pneumothorax, and a small abdominal hernia. The ferret was treated with resuscitative fluids, thoracocentesis, abdominal counterpressure, and blood transfusion. This is the first case report of multi-systemic trauma in a ferret. The ferret made a complete recovery and was discharged to the referring veterinarian three days after presentation. (Vet. Emerg. Crit. Care, 10:13?18, 2000)

AB  - Summary Trauma is a leading cause of death worldwide in persons under 44 years of age, and uncontrolled haemorrhage is the most common preventable cause of death in this patient group. The transfusion management of trauma haemorrhage is unrecognisable from 20 years ago. Changes in clinical practice have been driven primarily by an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), which is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including a 3- to 4-fold increased risk of death. Targeting this coagulopathy alongside changes to surgical and anaesthetic practices (an overarching strategy known as damage control surgery/damage control resuscitation) has led to a significant reduction in mortality rates over the last two decades. This narrative review will discuss the transfusion practices that are currently used for trauma haemorrhage and the evidence that supports these practices.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are among the most misdiagnosed and underreported types of head trauma. The potential long-term impact of undiagnosed or incorrectly identified concussions and other head injuries are potentially devastating, as evidenced by the increasing societal burden exhibited by soldiers returning from combat and athletes in contact sports. Concussions and TBI are notoriously difficult to correctly diagnose and prognosis for these injuries is poorly understood. In order to increase the likelihood of successful diagnosis, treatment, and prediction of outcomes, a definitive differential diagnosis will need to be established. The establishment of a ?trauma?specific profile? or a panel of known trauma markers will significantly aid in this goal. Small membrane vesicles called exosomes have been shown to contain proteins and injury-specific biomarkers. In the future it is possible that they could become an important tool, utilized for their diagnostic and therapeutic potential.

AB  - Blast-induced traumatic brain injury is on the rise, predominantly as a result of the use of improvised explosive devices, resulting in undesirable neuropsychological dysfunctions, as demonstrated in both animals and humans. This study investigated the effect of open-field blast injury on the rat brain using multi-echo, susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). Multi-echo SWI provided phase maps with better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), making it a sensitive technique for brain injury. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a survivable blast of 180 kPa. The visibility of blood vessels of varying sizes improved with multi-echo SWI. Reduced signal intensity from major vessels post-blast indicates increased deoxyhaemoglobin. Relative cerebral blood flow was computed from filtered phase SWI images using inferred changes in oxygen saturation from major blood vessels. Cerebral blood flow decreased significantly at day 3 and day 5 post-blast compared with that pre-blast. This was substantiated by the upregulation of ?-amyloid precursor protein (?-APP), a marker of ischaemia, in the neuronal perikaya of the cerebral cortex, as observed by immunofluorescence, and in the cortical tissue by western blot analysis. Our findings indicate the presence of brain ischaemia in post-blast acute phase of injury with possible recovery subsequently. Our results from cerebrovascular imaging, histology and staining provide an insight into the ischaemic state of the brain post-blast and may be useful for prognosis and outcome.

AB  - Abstract Objective The utility of calcium, magnesium and phosphate measurement in the ED is limited. We aimed to determine clinical risk variables for abnormal levels of these electrolytes in order to inform the development of an ordering guideline. Methods We performed a retrospective, observational study of patients who presented to a tertiary referral ED between January and June 2017. Adult patients who had serum calcium, magnesium or phosphate tests completed during their ED stay were included. Presenting symptoms and signs, comorbidities, medication use and laboratory values were extracted from the medical record. Patients with missing data items were excluded. Logistic regression models determined clinical risk variables associated with low and high levels of each electrolyte. Results A total of 33?120 adults presented during the study period. Of the 1679 calcium, 1576 magnesium and 1511 phosphate tests, 228 (13.6%), 158 (10.0%) and 387 (25.6%) were abnormal, respectively. Significant risk variables (P?<?0.05) for abnormal levels were: hypocalcaemia ? vomiting, perioral numbness, hand/foot spasm, calcium and phosphate supplements and chemotherapy (odds ratio [OR] range 5.9?17.3); hypercalcaemia ? female sex, vomiting, polyuria, confusion, hyperparathyroidism, cancer and type 1 diabetes (OR range 2.3?9.7); hypomagnesemia ? female sex, proton pump inhibitor use, tacrolimus use, alcohol abuse and type 2 diabetes (OR range 2.2?13.1); hypermagnesemia ? lethargy, thiazide use and chronic kidney disease (OR range 4.3?4.5); hypophosphatemia ? nausea, seizure and glucocorticoid use (OR range 1.7?2.1); and hyperphosphataemia ? polyuria, diuretics and chronic kidney disease (OR range 1.9?5.0). Conclusion A range of demographic, comorbid, medication and clinical variables are associated with abnormal calcium, magnesium and phosphate levels. These findings will inform the development of clinical guidelines to rationalise calcium, magnesium and phosphate testing. Justification may be required for testing patients with no risk variables.

AB  - SUMMARY HLA-DR expression on monocytes as marker for monocytic function is severely depressed after major trauma. The membrane enzyme aminopeptidase N/CD13 can trigger help in antigen processing by MHC class II molecules of antigen-presenting cells. We determined the simultaneous expression of HLA-DR and CD13 on peripheral blood monocytes of patients with major trauma (injury severity score of ≥16). 1?: 1 conjugates of phycoerythrin (PE)-to-monoclonal antibody were used in combination with QuantiBRITETM PE beads for a standardized quantification in terms of antibodies bound per cell (ABC). The very low expression of HLA-DR antigen on monocytes of patients at day 1 after major trauma confirmed previous results in the literature. Monocytic HLA-DR expression increased slowly to reach values in the lower range of healthy volunteers at day 14. Monocytic CD13 expression at day 1 showed values in the range of healthy volunteers, and a strong rise afterwards. Fourteen days after trauma, the monocytic expression of CD13 was still much higher than in the control group. Because lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 have been shown to be involved in the depressed HLA-DR expression on monocytes in trauma patients, we studied the in vitro effects of LPS and interleukin (IL)-10 on the expression of CD13 on monocytes prepared from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers. Whereas a 3-day IL-10 treatment resulted in a down-regulation of both HLA-DR and CD13 expression on monocytes, LPS caused a down-regulation of HLA-DR but a rapid up-regulation of CD13 levels. Therefore we suggest that, with respect to monocytic CD13 expression, LPS rather than IL-10 could well be the explanation for monocytic surface molecules after severe injury, although other mediators with a CD13 regulating function have to be considered.

AB  - Abstract Background Traumatic injury can lead to dysregulation of the normal clotting system, resulting in hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications. Platelet activation is robust following traumatic injury and one process of platelet activation is to release of extracellular vesicles (PEV) that carry heterogenous cargo loads and surface ligands. Objectives We sought to investigate and characterize the release and function of PEVs generated following traumatic injury. Methods PEV content and quantity in circulation following trauma in humans and mice was measured using flow cytometry, size exclusion chromatography, and nanoparticle tracking analysis. PEVs were isolated from circulation and the effects on thrombin generation, bleeding time, hemorrhage control, and thrombus formation were determined. Finally, the effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on PEV release and thrombosis were examined. Results Human and murine trauma results in a significant release of PEVs into circulation compared with healthy controls. These PEVs result in abundant thrombin generation, increased platelet aggregation, decreased bleeding times, and decreased hemorrhage in uncontrolled bleeding. Conversely, PEVs contributed to enhanced venous thrombus formation and were recruited to the developing thrombus site. Interestingly, HCQ treatment resulted in decreased platelet aggregation, decreased PEV release, and reduced deep vein thrombosis burden in mice. Conclusions These data demonstrate that trauma results in significant release of PEVs which are both pro-hemostatic and pro-thrombotic. The effects of PEVs can be mitigated by treatment with HCQ, suggesting the potential use as a form of deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

AB  - AbstractSevere extremity trauma often results in large zones of injury comprising multiple types of tissue and presents many clinical challenges for reconstruction. Considerable investigation is ongoing in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine therapeutics to improve reconstruction outcomes; however, the vast majority of musculoskeletal trauma models employed for testing the therapeutics consist of single-tissue defects, offering limited utility for investigating strategies for multi-tissue repair. Here we present the first model of composite lower limb bone and nerve injury, characterized by comparison to well-established, single-tissue injury models, using biomaterials-based technologies previously demonstrated to show promise in those models. Quantitative functional outcome measures were incorporated to facilitate assessment of new technologies to promote structural and functional limb salvage following severe extremity trauma. Nerve injury induced significant changes in the morphology and mechanical properties of intact bones. However, BMP-mediated segmental bone regeneration was not significantly impaired by concomitant nerve injury, as evaluated via radiographs, microcomputed tomography (?CT) and biomechanical testing. Neither was nerve regeneration significantly impaired by bone injury when evaluated via histology and electrophysiology. Despite the similar tissue regeneration observed, the composite injury group experienced a marked functional deficit in the operated limb compared to either of the single-tissue injury groups, as determined by quantitative, automated CatWalk gait analysis. As a whole, this study presents a challenging, clinically relevant model of severe extremity trauma to bone and nerve tissue, and emphasizes the need to incorporate quantitative functional outcome measures to benchmark tissue engineering therapies.

AB  - ABSTRACT The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is a fundamental component of cellular metabolism. The PPP is important to maintain carbon homoeostasis, to provide precursors for nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis, to provide reducing molecules for anabolism, and to defeat oxidative stress. The PPP shares reactions with the Entner?Doudoroff pathway and Calvin cycle and divides into an oxidative and non-oxidative branch. The oxidative branch is highly active in most eukaryotes and converts glucose 6-phosphate into carbon dioxide, ribulose 5-phosphate and NADPH. The latter function is critical to maintain redox balance under stress situations, when cells proliferate rapidly, in ageing, and for the ?Warburg effect? of cancer cells. The non-oxidative branch instead is virtually ubiquitous, and metabolizes the glycolytic intermediates fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as well as sedoheptulose sugars, yielding ribose 5-phosphate for the synthesis of nucleic acids and sugar phosphate precursors for the synthesis of amino acids. Whereas the oxidative PPP is considered unidirectional, the non-oxidative branch can supply glycolysis with intermediates derived from ribose 5-phosphate and vice versa, depending on the biochemical demand. These functions require dynamic regulation of the PPP pathway that is achieved through hierarchical interactions between transcriptome, proteome and metabolome. Consequently, the biochemistry and regulation of this pathway, while still unresolved in many cases, are archetypal for the dynamics of the metabolic network of the cell. In this comprehensive article we review seminal work that led to the discovery and description of the pathway that date back now for 80 years, and address recent results about genetic and metabolic mechanisms that regulate its activity. These biochemical principles are discussed in the context of PPP deficiencies causing metabolic disease and the role of this pathway in biotechnology, bacterial and parasite infections, neurons, stem cell potency and cancer metabolism.

AB  - Purpose In clinical conditions trauma is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Neutrophils play a key role in the development of multiple organ failure after trauma Experimental design To have a detailed understanding of the neutrophil activation at primary stages after trauma, neutrophils are isolated from control and surgical trauma rats in this study. Extracted proteins are analyzed using nano liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Results A total of 2924 rat neutrophil proteins are identified in our analysis, of which 393 are found differentially regulated between control and trauma groups. By using functional pathways analysis of the 190 proteins up-regulated in surgical trauma, we found proteins related to transcription initiation and protein biosynthesis. On the other hand, among the 203 proteins down-regulated in surgical trauma we found enrichment for proteins of the immune response, proteasome degradation and actin cytoskeleton. Overall, enzyme prediction analysis revealed that regulated enzymes are directly involved in neutrophil apoptosis, directional migration and chemotaxis. Our observations are then confirmed by in silico protein?protein interaction analysis. Conclusions and clinical relevance Collectively, our results reveal that neutrophils drastically regulate their biochemical pathways after the early stages of surgical trauma, showing lower activity. This implies higher susceptibility of the trauma patients to infection and bystander tissues damage.

It discusses the equipment needed to develop a pitch-side emergency dental kit, for any dentist or associated professional who may be able to give immediate relief and treatment to an injured athlete. Trauma to the supporting structures of the teeth can be classified as: concussion, lateral luxation, subluxation, intrusion, extrusion, and avulsion. The chapter outlines the types of root fracture commonly seen, looks at the response of the tissues to root fractures, and discusses the treatment options following a root fracture. It deals with the splinting techniques that provide support for traumatized teeth during the initial healing phase. Prolonged use of a splint can result in ankylosis of the tooth, which may be transient unless the injury to the cementum is extensive.

AB  - Abstract:? We tested the independent utility of ?-amyloid precursor protein (?-APP) immunohistochemical staining as evidence of brain trauma in the deaths of young children. Blinded reviewers retrospectively reviewed immunostained brain tissues from homicidal deaths, age-matched control cases without evidence of trauma, as well as cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The reviewers correctly identified five of the seven cases with documented inflicted head trauma. However, one of seven age-matched control cases and one of 10 SIDS/sudden unexplained death in infancy (SUDI) cases demonstrated staining patterns similar to those seen in cases of inflicted trauma. We discuss these cases and the circumstances surrounding them with the intent to explain the difficulties associated with immunohistological interpretation of axonal injury. Although the utility of ?-APP is quite powerful if not confounded by global hypoxic-ischemic injury, ultimately, ?-APP studies should be only one piece of information in the determination of cause and manner of death.

AB  - Abstract Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient sources added to Food (ANS) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the re-evaluation of 12 modified starches (E 1404, E 1410, E 1412, E 1413, E 1414, E 1420, E 1422, E 1440, E 1442, E 1450, E 1451 and E 1452) authorised as food additives in the EU in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and previously evaluated by JECFA and the SCF. Both committees allocated an acceptable daily intake (ADI) ?not specified?. In humans, modified starches are not absorbed intact but significantly hydrolysed by intestinal enzymes and then fermented by the intestinal microbiota. Using the read-across approach, the Panel considered that adequate data on short- and long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicity are available. Based on in silico analyses, modified starches are considered not to be of genotoxic concern. No treatment-related effects relevant for human risk assessment were observed in rats fed very high levels of modified starches (up to 31,000 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day). Modified starches (e.g. E 1450) were well tolerated in humans up to a single dose of 25,000 mg/person. Following the conceptual framework for the risk assessment of certain food additives, the Panel concluded that there is no safety concern for the use of modified starches as food additives at the reported uses and use levels for the general population and that there is no need for a numerical ADI. The combined exposure to E 1404?E 1451 at the 95th percentile of the refined (brand-loyal) exposure assessment scenario for the general population was up to 3,053 mg/kg bw per day. Exposure to E 1452 for food supplement consumers only at the 95th percentile was up to 22.1 mg/kg bw per day.

AB  - Background Heparin-binding protein (HBP) is a neutrophil-derived protein advocated as a biomarker in sepsis. We evaluated plasma HBP as a predictor of post-injury sepsis in trauma patients. Methods Ninety-seven trauma patients were studied during the first week of intensive care. Injury-related data were collected and clinical parameters registered daily. Plasma HBP was sampled on day 1, 3 and 5 after trauma and evaluated for associations with injury-related parameters and sepsis. The predictive properties of HBP were compared to C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC). Results Median Injury Severity Score was 33, one-third of the trauma patients received massive transfusion and a quarter was in shock on arrival. Overall 30-day mortality was 8%. Plasma HBP was significantly higher in severely injured patients and associated with shock on arrival, massive transfusions and organ failure. Septic patients had higher levels of HBP only on day 5. When evaluated for prediction of onset of sepsis during the two following days after plasma sampling by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, areas under the curves were non-significant for all time points. Similar patterns were seen for CRP and WBC. Conclusion In trauma patients, HBP levels are related to severity of injury and organ dysfunction. Heparin-binding protein was weakly associated with sepsis and only at the later stage of the observation period of 1 week. Moreover, HBP showed poor discriminatory properties as an early biomarker of post-injury sepsis. Trauma-induced inflammation during the post-injury phase may blunt the sepsis-predictive performance of HBP.

AB  - The mechanism of secondary damage spread after brain trauma remains unsolved. In this work, we redirected the attention to astrocytic communication pathways. Using an in vitro trauma model that consists of a scratch injury applied to an astrocyte monolayer, we found a significant and transient induction of connexin43 (Cx43) hemichannel activity in regions distal from the injury, which was maximal ?1 h after scratch. Two connexin hemichannel blockers, La3+ and the peptide Gap26, abolished the increased activity, which was also absent in Cx43 KO astrocytes. In addition, the scratch-induced increase of hemichannel activity was prevented by inhibition of P2 purinergic receptors. Changes in hemichannel activity took place with a particular spatial distribution, with cells located at ?17 mm away from the scratch presenting the highest activity (dye uptake). In contrast, the functional state of gap junction channels (dye coupling) was not significantly affected. Cx43 hemichannel activity was also enhanced by the acute extracellular application of 60 mM K+. The increase in hemichannel activity was associated with an increment in apoptotic cells at 24 h after scratch that was totally prevented by Gap26 peptide. These findings suggest that Cx43 hemichannels could be a new approach to prevent or reduce the secondary cell damage of brain trauma. GLIA 2015;63:1185?1199

AB  - Abstract Recent studies have suggested that changes in serum phosphate levels influence pathological states associated with aging such as cancer, bone metabolism, and cardiovascular function, even in individuals with normal renal function. The causes are only beginning to be elucidated but are likely a combination of endocrine, paracrine, autocrine, and cell autonomous effects. We have used an integrated quantitative biology approach, combining transcriptomics and proteomics to define a multi-phase, extracellular phosphate-induced, signaling network in pre-osteoblasts as well as primary human and mouse mesenchymal stromal cells. We identified a rapid mitogenic response stimulated by elevated phosphate that results in the induction of immediate early genes including c-fos. The mechanism of activation requires FGF receptor signaling followed by stimulation of N-Ras and activation of AP-1 and serum response elements. A distinct long-term response also requires FGF receptor signaling and results in N-Ras activation and expression of genes and secretion of proteins involved in matrix regulation, calcification, and angiogenesis. The late response is synergistically enhanced by addition of FGF23 peptide. The intermediate phase results in increased oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production and is necessary for the late response providing a functional link between the phases. Collectively, the results define elevated phosphate, as a mitogen and define specific mechanisms by which phosphate stimulates proliferation and matrix regulation. Our approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the cellular response to elevated extracellular phosphate, functionally connecting temporally coordinated signaling, transcriptional, and metabolic events with changes in long-term cell behavior.

AB  - Abstract Gelatin scaffolds incorporating or not 50?wt% of magnesium calcium phosphate (MCP) or ?-tricalcium phosphate (?TCP) were prepared and the in vitro osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the scaffolds was investigated. The pore sizes of the scaffolds were in the range 123.8?±?47.2?153?±?60.72?µm in diameter, while the porosity was 33.3?±?2?44.9?±?3.4%. The compression modulus of the sponges was about 2.04?2.24?mPa. There was no significant difference among groups regarding the physical and mechanical properties. When seeded into the sponges by an agitation method, the MSCs were distributed throughout the scaffold. Higher MSC proliferation was observed for scaffolds incorporating minerals. Following the incubation of MSCs in scaffolds incorporating MCP, the alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly higher at weeks 2, 3 and 4 in comparison with other scaffolds; however, the osteocalcin levels of MSCs did not show significant differences among groups. These findings indicate that MSCs seeded in scaffolds incorporating MCP showed significantly superior biological results in terms of proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in comparison with other scaffold types.

AB  - Abstract Posterolateral spinal fusion (PLF) is a common procedure in orthopedic surgery that is performed to fuse adjacent vertebrae to reduce symptoms related to spinal conditions. In the current study, a novel synthetic calcium phosphate with submicron surface topography was evaluated as an autograft extender in a validated rabbit model of PLF. Fifty-nine skeletally mature New Zealand white rabbits were divided into three groups and underwent single-level intertransverse process PLF at L4-5 using (1) autologous bone graft (ABG) alone or in a 1:1 combination with (2) calcium phosphate granules (ABG/BCPgranules), or (3) granules embedded in a fast-resorbing polymeric carrier (ABG/BCPputty). After 6, 9, and 12 weeks, animals were sacrificed and spinal fusion was assessed by manual palpation, Radiographs, micro-CT, mechanical testing (12 weeks only), histology, and histomorphometry. Based on all endpoints, all groups showed a gradual progression in bone formation and maturation during time, leading to solid fusion masses between the transverse processes after 12 weeks. Fusion assessments by manual palpation, radiography and histology were consistent and demonstrated equivalent fusion rates between groups, with high bilateral fusion rates after 12 weeks. Mechanical tests after 12 weeks indicated substantially lower range of motion for all groups, compared to non-operated controls. By histology and histomorphometry, the gradual formation and maturation of bone in the fusion mass was confirmed for each graft type. With these results, we describe the equivalent performance between autograft and a novel calcium phosphate material as an autograft extender in a rabbit model of PLF using an extensive range of evaluation techniques. ? 2019 The Authors.
