AB  - Abstract An acute trauma to the CNS rapidly results in the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines that include interleukin-1 (IL-1). We report here that the levels of several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are also elevated following a corticectomy trauma injury to the mouse CNS. The delayed upregulation of MMPs compared to that for IL-1 suggests the possibility that inflammatory cytokines regulate MMP production in CNS trauma. To resolve this, we developed a method to isolate and maintain highly enriched human fetal neurons or astrocytes in culture and examined the regulation by cytokines of the activity of a subgroup of MMPs, the gelatinases (MMP-2 and -9). While both neuronal and astrocytic cultures displayed comparable MMP-2 activity, as evidenced by gelatin zymography, levels of MMP-9 were proportionately higher in neurons compared to astrocytes. Of a variety of cytokines and growth factors tested in vitro, only IL-1? was effective in increasing the neuronal expression of MMP-9. Finally, an IL-1 receptor antagonist attenuated the increase of neuronal MMP-9 in culture and abolished the injury-induced increase of MMP-9 in the mouse brain. These results implicate IL-1? as a key regulator of neuronal MMP-9 in culture and of the elevation of MMP-9 that occurs following mouse CNS trauma. J. Neurosci.

AB  - Abstract Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membranes were modified by graft copolymerization with methacryloxyethyl phosphate (MOEP) in methanol and 2-butanone (methyl ethyl ketone (MEK)) at ambient temperature using gamma irradiation. The effect of dose rate (0.46 and 4.6 kGy h?1), monomer concentration (1?40 %) and solvent were studied and the modified membranes were characterized by weight increase, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). XPS was used to determine the % degree of surface coverage using the C?F (ePTFE membrane) and the C?C (MOEP graft copolymer) peaks. Grafting yield, as well as surface coverage, were found to increase with increasing monomer concentration and were significantly higher for samples grafted in MEK than in methanol solution. SEM images showed distinctly different surface morphologies for the membranes grafted in methanol (smooth) and MEK (globular), hence indicating phase separation of the homopolymer in MEK. We propose that in our system, the non-solvent properties of MEK for the homopolymer play a more important role than solvent chain transfer reactions in determining grafting outcomes.

AB  - Introduction of porosity to calcium phosphate scaffolds for bone repair has created a new challenge when measuring bioresorption in vitro, rendering traditional outcome measures redundant. The aim of this study is to identify a surrogate endpoint for use with 3D scaffolds. Murine RAW 264.7 cells are cultured on dense discs of ?-tricalcium phosphate in conditions to stimulate osteoclast (OC) formation. Multinucleated OCs are visible from day 6 with increases at days 8 and 10. Resorption pits are first observed at day 6 with much larger pits visible at days 8, 10, and 12. The concentration of calcium ions in the presence of cells is significantly higher than cell-free cultures at days 3 and 9. Using linear regression analysis, Ca ion release could account for 35.9% of any subsequent change in resorption area. The results suggest that Ca ion release is suitable to measure resorption of a beta-tricalcium phosphate ceramic substrate in vitro. This model could replace the more accepted resorption pit assay in circumstances where quantification of pits is not possible, e.g., when characterizing 3D tissue engineered bone scaffolds.

AB  - Abstract A severe microarterial trauma (arteriotomy/intimectomy) was introduced to the central arteries of rabbit ears. Twenty-one patent vessels, 3 at each interval of 2 hours, 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, and 90 days after reperfusion were taken for light and scanning electron microscopy studies. These vessels remained patent at all time intervals. A physiological ?in vivo? perfusion technique with fixation fluid of normal temperature (37°C), pressure (120 mm Hg) and osmolarity (300 mOsm) was used to ensure fixed relaxed vessels. The endothelial, internal elastic, and part of the medial layers of vessel walls were removed following intimectomy. The inner surface of the intimectomy region was irregular and partly covered with thrombotic materials between 2 hours and 3 days postreperfusion. Endothelialization of the traumatized region was first observed at 3 days and was completed between 7 and 14 days. Intimal hyperplasia developed during this period and had not diminished in thickness by 30 or 90 days. The trauma and healing process of the arteriotomy/intimectomy are similar to the healing of vascular anastomoses and virtually identical to the clinical trauma of vessel avulsion, but neointima formation is more pronounced and engages vessel walls far outside the intimectomy site. ? 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Osteoporotic femur fractures are the most common fragility fracture and account for approximately one million injuries per year. Local intervention by intra-marrow injection is potentially a good choice for preventing osteoporotic bone loss when the osteoporotic femoral fracture was treated. Previously, it was shown that trace element co-doped calcium phosphate (teCaP) implants could stimulate osteoporotic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell activity in vitro and bone regeneration in femoral bone defects in osteoporotic animal models. They hypothesized that local intra-marrow injection of teCaP particles could improve bone function because the teCaP can sustain release of biologically essential inorganic minerals and improve bone remodeling in osteoporosis. The teCaP and CaP particles were synthesized in simulated body fluid with and without adding silicon, zinc and strontium ions. Female rats (8 months) were ovariectomized (OVX) or sham-operated, and then intervened in the femoral marrow space at 12 months old. Groups include: (1) saline water; (2) CaP particles; and (3) teCaP particles. After 2?3 months of intervention, the sham groups showed higher bone mineral density (MBD) in the femur, and teCaP group increased the BMD in the OVX groups. The compressive strength of the OVX-teCaP group was significantly higher than that in the OVX-CaP group. Significant differences between OVX-teCaP and OVX-CaP groups were found for bone mineral microarchitecture, bone mineral density, and trace mineral content, but not for feces composition. These results confirm the teCaP particles could suppress osteoporotic bone loss by local intramarrow injection. Therefore, this biomaterial could be used as a next-generation combination treatment for osteoporotic trauma and osteoporosis itself. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Induction of terpene synthase (TPS) gene expression and enzyme activity is known to occur in response to various chemical and biological stimuli in several species of spruce (genus Picea). However, high sequence identity between TPS family members has made it difficult to determine the induction patterns of individual TPS at the protein and transcript levels and whether specific TPS enzymes respond differentially to treatment. In the present study we used a multi-level approach to measure the induction and activity of TPS enzymes in protein extracts of Norway spruce (Picea abies) bark tissue following treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Measurements were made on the transcript, protein, enzyme activity and metabolite levels. Using a relatively new proteomics application, selective reaction monitoring (SRM), it was possible to differentiate and quantitatively measure the abundance of several known TPS proteins and three 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) isoforms in Norway spruce. Protein levels of individual TPS and DXS enzymes were differentially induced upon MeJA treatment and good correlation was generally observed between induction of transcripts, proteins, and enzyme activities. Most of the mono- and diterpenoid metabolites accumulated with similar temporal patterns of induction as part of the coordinated multi-compound chemical defense response. Protein and enzyme activity levels of the monoTPS (+)-3-carene synthase and the corresponding accumulation of (+)-3-carene was induced to a higher fold change than any other TPS or metabolite measured, indicating an important role in the induced terpenoid defense response in Norway spruce.

The histology of these lesions showed hyperkeratosis, acanthosis and marked dilation of vessels in the papillary to deep dermis. The electron microscopic study revealed a layer of endothelial cells surrounding the dilated vessels, suggestive of telangiectasia. The relationship between this entity and solitary angiokcratoma is discussed.

AB  - Regulation of phosphate (PO4) in hemodialysis patients is very difficult and ideal levels are rarely maintained. A high removal and a normal phosphate level is important, as high and low levels are both associated with morbidity and a very high mortality. We studied phosphate dynamics and its relation to other small ?uremic? molecules in 48 patients by measuring pre- and postdialysis levels and all removed phosphate, urea and creatinine (creat) in all dialysate during 455 dialyses done at different frequencies (freq): 3.7?±?1.2, range 3?6 treatments per week and durations of dialysis (t): mean: 196?±?95, range 80?560?min and with high (HF) and low flux membranes. Kt/V-PO4, Kt/V-urea and Kt/V-creat, volumes (Vr) for all solutes and their relationships to frequency and duration of dialysis, urea clearance and predialysis phosphate were calculated. Factor/solute: PO4 Urea-N Creatinine Predialysis mg/dl 5.7?±?1.9 73?±?24 12?±?3 Postdialysis mg/dl 3.0?±?1.0 33?±?15 6?±?2 100???Vr/BW 63?±?78 58?±?24 41?±?15 Kt/V 1.01?±?0.66 1.04?±?0.32 0.97?±?0.26 Weekly stdKt/V 1.75?±?0.81 2.12?±?0.68 1.96?±?0.71 Removed gm/week 3.1?±?1.3 56?±?23 6.2?±?2.5 Vr?=?removed solute?÷?(predialysis minus postdialysis concentration.); BW?=?body weight. Uf?=?ultrafiltration. Results: Vr as a percentage of BW for PO4 was dependent on predialysis PO4 and rose steeply as predialysis PO4 decreased: Vr% BW?=?212???88???ln (predialysis PO4), (r?=?0.39, p?<?0.0001). There was no such relationship for Vr for urea or creatinine and no relation between urea and PO4 Vr, (r?=?0.07, p?=?0.141). In stepwise multiple regression analysis: Mg PO4 removed per week?=?t???6.5?+?freq???387?+?Uf???140?+?pre-PO4???273?+?PO4 stdKt/V???343???HF???375???1824, (r?=?0.73, p?<?0.0001). Blood flow(QB) and dialysate flow (QD), urea weekly stdKt/V were not significant variables in the model. Pre-dialysis PO4?=?6.8???Hrs/week???0.07???QB???0.003?+?Uf??? 0.26. QD, membrane type or dialyses/week did not enter the model. Only patients dialyzing>28 hrs/week could stop phosphate binders within 3 weeks. Conclusions:?Phosphate shows a highly variable dynamic during dialysis. Apparently, the body maintains extracellular PO4 concentration by releasing PO4 from unknown compartments when the blood concentration of PO4 decreases. Vr for phosphate thus varies not only from patient to patient but also in a patient, depending on blood concentration of PO4. Kt/V for urea and creatinine are inaccurate in describing PO4 removal. To remove PO4 efficiently it is most important to use long and daily dialysis. QB, QD and membrane type are relatively unimportant in phosphate removal.

AB  - Abstract Background: To examine whether the complex branched fibers observed in mdx mutant mice were formed in normal skeletal muscles, long-term repetitive muscle trauma was applied to muscle of normal Wistar male rats. Methods: Three kinds of artificial muscle trauma?crush injury, bupivacaine hydrochloride treatment, and forced stretching of contracting muscle (eccentric contraction)?were performed once a week for 10 weeks to achieve a state of repetitive degeneration and regeneration in the muscles. Two weeks after the final treatment, numerical, histochemical, and three-dimensional analyses by scanning electron microscopy were performed. Results: Mean numbers of total branched fibers of the three groups were increased compared with normal control values, especially in the bupivacaine treatment group (three- to fivefold greater than in the other two groups). Aggregations of fibers of the same type which usually appear in mdx mice were observed in various parts of histological sections of the bupivacaine treatment group and only in a part of the crush injury group. No aggregations were observed in sections of the forced stretching group. In the three-dimensional analysis, complex branched fibers appearing as an ?anastomosing syncytial reticulum? were observed only in the bupivacaine treatment group. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the formation of an anastomosing syncytial reticulum is one of the adaptation mechanisms of normal skeletal muscle rather than a specific event in mdx mutant mice, and long-term repeated trauma of the same fiber is necessary for this formation. Adaptive changes in the muscles with the three different types of muscle trauma are discussed. ? 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract One of the most important requirements for calcium phosphate bone cements (CPBC) is remodelling in vivo. Degradation of the artificial material and the formation of native new bone matrix have to interdigitate to avoid instability. The remodelling process should not last longer than one year. In this study a CPBC was modified with O-phospho-L-serine (phosphoserine) to improve the material properties in order to speed up remodelling in vivo. The results showed that the modified cements exhibit a nano-crystalline microstructure with a high specific surface area and increased compressive strength (about 50?%). Metabolic activity of osteoblasts was improved on the modified material. Monocytes were found to be highly activated on the cements containing phosphoserine. In addition the formation of multinucleated giant cells (osteoclast-like cells) was not impaired on phosphoserine modified cement composites. In vivo experiments in Wistar rats and mini pigs clearly revealed that phosphoserine modified cements showed a higher capability of remodelling compared to the cements without phosphoserine.

In this review, we summarize how FTY720 came from the lab bench to the bedside by examining its structural similarities to natural occuring sphingosine analogues, the mechanism of action, and clinical applicability to not only transplantation but also autoimmune, oncological, and neurobiological fields. FTY720, a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) analogue, promotes the survival of human and animal allografts by sequestering T lymphocytes within peripheral lymphoid tissue. The mechanism of sequestration is three-fold:(1) T lymphocytes are driven into peripheral lymph nodes in a chemokine dependent manner by FTY720;(2) FTY720 downregulates sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors (S1PRs) on the T lymphocyte surface, rendering it unable to migrate along a S1P gradient; and (3) FTY720 closes stromal gates on the abluminal side of the lymphatic endothelium. Future areas of investigation include developing S1P analogues that have specific agonist binding to S1PRs avoiding side effects seen in non-specific binding.

AB  - Abstract The combination of the two techniques of rapid prototyping 3D-plotting and bioactive surface functionalization is presented, with emphasis on the in vitro effect of Bone Sialoprotein (BSP) on primary human osteoblasts (hOBs). Our primary objective was to demonstrate the BSP influence on the expression of distinctive osteoblast markers in hOBs. Secondary objectives included examinations of the scaffolds' surface and the stability of BSP-coating as well as investigations of cell viability and proliferation. 3D-plotted calcium phosphate cement (CPC) scaffolds were coated with BSP via physisorption. hOBs were seeded on the coated scaffolds, followed by cell viability measurements, gene expression analysis and visualization. Physisorption is an effective method for BSP-coating. Coating with higher BSP concentrations leads to enhanced BSP release. Two BSP concentrations (50 and 200 ?g/mL) were examined in this study. The lower BSP concentration (50 µg/mL) decreased ALP and SPARC expression, whereas the higher BSP concentration (200 ?g/mL) did not change gene marker expression. Enhanced cell viability was observed on BSP-coated scaffolds on day 3. hOBs developed a polygonal shape and connected in an intercellular network under BSP influence. Quantitative cell morphology analyses demonstrated for BSP-coated CPCs an enhanced cell area and reduced circularity. The strength of the above-mentioned effects of BSP-coated scaffolds in vivo is unknown, and future work is focusing on bone ingrowth and vascularization in vivo. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J Clin Periodontol 2010; 37: 419?426 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-051X.2010.01547.x Abstract Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate local bone formation following systemic administration of parathyroid hormone (1?34) (PTH), a surgically implanted synthetic ?-tricalcium phosphate (?-TCP) bone biomaterial serving as a matrix to support new bone formation. Materials and Methods: Critical-size, 8?mm, calvarial through-and-through osteotomy defects were surgically created in 100 adult male Sprague?Dawley rats. The animals were randomized into five groups of 20 animals each to receive one of the following treatments: PTH (15??g PTH/kg/day; subcutaneously), PTH/?-TCP, ?-TCP, or particulate human demineralized freeze-dried bone (DFDB), and sham-surgery controls. Ten animals/group were euthanized at 4 and 8 weeks post-surgery for radiographic and histometric analysis. Results: The histometric analysis showed that systemic PTH significantly enhanced local bone formation, bone fill averaging (±SE) 32.2±4.0% compared with PTH/?-TCP (15.7±2.4%), ?-TCP (12.5±2.3%), DFDB (14.5±2.3%), and sham-surgery control (10.0±1.5%) at 4 weeks (p<0.014). Systemic PTH showed significantly enhanced bone formation (41.5±4.0%) compared with PTH/?-TCP (22.4±3.0%), ?-TCP (21.3±4.4%), and with the sham-surgery control (23.8±4.2%) at 8 weeks (p<0.025). The DFDB group showed significantly increased bone formation from 4 (14.5±2.3%) to 8 weeks (32.0±3.2%) (p<0.006). The PTH/?-TCP and ?-TCP groups both showed limited biomaterials resorption. The radiographic analysis was not diagnostic to distinguish local bone formation from the radiopaque ?-TCP biomaterial. Conclusions: Systemic administration of PTH significantly stimulates local bone formation. Bone formation was significantly limited by the ?-TCP biomaterial.

AB  - Abstract Animal models of tinnitus allow us to study the relationship between changes in neural activity and the tinnitus percept. Here, guinea pigs were subjected to unilateral noise trauma and tested behaviourally for tinnitus 8 weeks later. By comparing animals with tinnitus with those without, all of which were noise-exposed, we were able to identify changes unique to the tinnitus group. Three physiological markers known to change following noise exposure were examined: spontaneous firing rates (SFRs) and burst firing in the inferior colliculus (IC), evoked auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), and the number of neurons in the cochlear nucleus containing nitric oxide synthase (NOS). We obtained behavioural evidence of tinnitus in 12 of 16 (75%) animals. Both SFRs and incidences of burst firing were elevated in the IC of all noise-exposed animals, but there were no differences between tinnitus and no-tinnitus animals. There were significant decreases in ipsilateral ABR latencies in tinnitus animals, contrary to what might be expected with a small hearing loss. Furthermore, there was an ipsilateral?contralateral asymmetry in NOS staining in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) that was only apparent in tinnitus animals. Tinnitus animals had a significantly greater number of NOS-containing neurons on the noise-exposed side, whereas no-tinnitus animals did not. These data suggest that measuring NOS in the VCN and recording ABRs supplement behavioural methods for confirming tinnitus in animals, and that nitric oxide is involved in plastic neural changes associated with tinnitus.

AB  - Abstract Preventing infection is one of the major challenges in total hip and joint arthroplasty. The main concerns of local drug delivery as a solution have been the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the potential inhibition of osseointegration caused by the delivery systems. This work investigated the in vitro drug release, antimicrobial performance, and cytotoxicity, as well as the in vivo bone growth of an antimicrobial peptide loaded into calcium phosphate coated Ti implants in a rabbit model. Two potent AMP candidates (HHC36: KRWWKWWRR, Tet213: KRWWKWWRRC) were first investigated through an in vitro cytotoxicity assay. MTT absorbance values revealed that HHC36 showed much lower cytotoxicity (minimal cytotoxic concentration 200 ?g/mL) than Tet 213 (50 ?g/mL). The AMP HHC36 loaded onto CaP (34.7 ± 4.2 ?g/cm2) had a burst release during the first few hours followed by a slow and steady release for 7 days as measured spectrophotometrically. The CaP-AMP coatings were antimicrobial against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in colony-forming units (CFU) in vitro assays. No cytotoxicity was observed on CaP-AMP samples against MG-63 osteoblast-like cells after 5 days in vitro. In a trabecular bone growth in vivo study using cylindrical implants, loading of AMP HHC36 did not impair bone growth onto the implants. Significant bone on-growth was observed on CaP-coated Ti with or without HHC36 loading, as compared with Ti alone. The current AMP-CaP coating thus offers in vivo osteoconductivity to orthopedic implants. It also offers in vitro antimicrobial property, with its in vivo performance to be confirmed in future animal infection models. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract??? Background:? Apical barrier formation and root strengthening procedures have been extensively described in the literature. This systematic review attempts to establish where the effects of interventions using multi-visit apexification, single visit apical plug techniques and root strengthening procedures are consistent and where they may vary significantly. Objectives:? To evaluate the relative effectiveness of apexification and apical plug techniques as well as root strengthening procedures for treating traumatized necrotic immature permanent anterior teeth through a systematic review of randomized controlled trials. Reported immediate and/or long-term adverse events and effects of the materials and techniques are also evaluated. Search strategy & selection criteria:? Structured electronic and hand search was performed with no restriction on the language of publication. Only randomized controlled trials comparing different apical barrier formation techniques and root strengthening procedures in traumatized necrotic immature anterior teeth were assessed. Results:? Two hundred studies were identified but only two were suitable for inclusion. Included studies investigated multi-visit apexification techniques using calcium hydroxide and tricalcium phosphate. There were no eligible studies investigating root strengthening procedures or any other intervention for apical barrier formation in necrotic immature anterior teeth. No reliable information was available on long-term adverse effects of the reported interventions or cost implications. Conclusions:? Based on two included studies, there is weak evidence supporting the use of either calcium hydroxide or tricalcium phosphate for apical barrier formation in necrotic immature anterior teeth employing multi-visit apexification techniques. The evidence is insufficient to provide guidelines for practice. There was no reliable evidence on adverse events or long-term effects after the use of calcium hydroxide or tricalcium phosphate justifying caution in their use in apical barrier formation techniques.

AB  - Abstract This study investigates the biological effects of traditional Chinese medicines on the activities of bone cells using rat bone cells. Then, a mixture of a GGT composite, that is, a novel biodegradable composite containing genipin crosslinked gelatin and tricalcium phosphate, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) was prepared as a GGT?TCM composite. A cultured neonatal rat calvarias organ was used to measure the potential of GGT?TCM composite for use in promoting the regeneration of defective bone tissue. The mitochondria activity of the bone cells following exposure to various concentrations of crude extracts of five herbal Chinese medicines was measured by colorimetric assay. Biochemical markers, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) titers were analyzed to evaluate the activities of bone cells. Finally, we examined the organ culture units, which were maintained in cultured medium for 5 weeks. Morphology of tissue was observed, and the quantitative evaluation of the regenerated bone was determined. In a bone cells culture experiment, adding Cuscuta chinensis Lam. (TCM-5) to the bone cells culture clearly promoted the proliferation and differentiation of the osteoblasts from their precursor cells; but the reduced amount of TRAP indicated that the medicine significantly inhibited the osteoclasts activities. Opposite bone cell responses were observed when Loranthus parasiticus Merr. (TCM-3) and Achyranthes bidentata Bl. (TCM-4) were added to the bone cells culture. Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. (TCM-1) and Dipsacus asper Wall. (TCM-2) potentially influence the proliferation and differentiation of the osteoblasts from their precursor cells, but they did not affect the osteoclasts activities. The finding from the organ culture indicated that Chinese medicine effectively increased the rate of tissue regeneration of damaged bones. ? 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Purpose The study was undertaken to demonstrate that there is more than 1 component in the extracellular Pi 31P signal ( ) acquired from human head using nonlocalized 31P MRS. Methods Outer-volume-suppression (OVS) saturation and 1D/2D 31P CSI were utilized to reveal the presence of an additional component in the signal. Results 67% of the head extracellular Pi signal was attenuated upon OVS saturation of the peripheral meningeal tissues, likely reflecting elimination of the Pi signal in the meningeal fluids (the blood and CSF). Localized 1D/2D CSI data provided further support for this assignment. Upon correction for the meningeal contribution, the extracellular Pi concentration was 0.51?±?0.07?mM, whereas the intracellular Pi was 0.85?±?0.10?mM. The extracellular pH was measured as 7.32?±?0.04 when using OVS, as compared to 7.39?±?0.03 when measured without OVS (N?=?7 subjects). Conclusion The extracellular Pi signal acquired from the human head using nonlocalized 31P MRS contains a significant component likely contributed by peripheral blood and CSF in meninges that must be removed in order to use this signal as an endogenous probe for measuring extracellular pH and other properties in the brain.

AB  - Abstract Objective Clinical neurological assessment is challenging for severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients in the acute setting. Waves of neurochemical abnormalities that follow TBI may serve as fluid biomarkers of neurological status. We assessed the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of glutamate, lactate, BDNF, and GDNF, to identify potential prognostic biomarkers of neurological outcome. Methods This cross-sectional study was carried out in a total of 20 consecutive patients (mean [SD] age, 29 [13] years; M/F, 9:1) with severe TBI Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8 and abnormal computed tomography scan on admission. Patients were submitted to ventricular drainage and had CSF collected between 2 and 4 h after hospital admission. Patients were then stratified according to two clinical outcomes: deterioration to brain death (nonsurvival, n = 6) or survival (survival, n = 14), within 3 days after hospital admission. CSF levels of brain-derived substances were compared between nonsurvival and survival groups. Clinical and neurological parameters were also assessed. Results Glutamate and lactate are significantly increased in nonsurvival relative to survival patients. We tested the accuracy of both biomarkers to discriminate patient outcome. Setting a cutoff of >57.75, glutamate provides 80.0% of sensitivity and 84.62% of specificity (AUC: 0.8214, 95% CL: 54.55?98.08%; and a cutoff of >4.65, lactate has 100% of sensitivity and 85.71% of specificity (AUC: 0.8810, 95% CL: 54.55?98.08%). BDNF and GDNF did not discriminate poor outcome. Interpretation This early study suggests that glutamate and lactate concentrations at hospital admission accurately predict death within 3 days after severe TBI.
