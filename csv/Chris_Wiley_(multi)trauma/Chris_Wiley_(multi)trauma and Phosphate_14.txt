AB  - Objectives The objective of this study was to compare hospitalisation duration, survival times, adverse events and cost of therapy in dogs with presumptive primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia undergoing therapy with mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids versus cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Methods A retrospective study of medical case records of dogs with presumed primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia was conducted. Data collected included signalment, presenting complaints, haematologic and biochemical profiles, vector-borne disease testing, thoracic and abdominal radiographs, abdominal ultrasound, medications administered, duration of hospitalisation, 30- and 60-day survival, adverse events and cost of therapy. Variables were compared between dogs treated solely with mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids or cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Results A total of 55 dogs with primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia were identified. Eighteen were excluded because multiple immunosuppressive medications were used during treatment. Hospitalisation times, 30-day survival and 60-day survival times were similar between both groups. Dogs in the mycophenolate mofetil/corticosteroid group experienced fewer adverse events than the cyclosporine/corticosteroid group. Therapy with mycophenolate mofetil was less expensive than that with cyclosporine. Clinical Significance These results suggest that using the combination of mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids appears to be as effective as cyclosporine and corticosteroids in the treatment of presumed primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia in dogs. Adverse events were less common and cost of therapy was lower in the mycophenolate mofetil group. Additional larger prospective, controlled, double-masked, outcome-based, multi-institutional studies are required to substantiate these preliminary findings.

AB  - Abstract Background Adult primary mesenchymal cells of different origin which can be obtained with minor donor site morbidity are considered for articular cartilage repair. This study aims at a comparison of their chondrogenic potential. Methods Mesenchymal cells were isolated from perichondrium/periosteum, bone marrow or fat of adult rats and found to be positive for the stem-cell-related antigens Sca-1, c-Kit, CD10, CD13 and CD90 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Chondrogenic differentiation was induced by applying recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) or adenoviral vectors carrying BMP-2 cDNA, followed by micromass culture. The stimulated cells were characterized by RT-PCR, cell proliferation and apoptosis assays. Expression of aggrecan, collagen type I, II, IX and X and alkaline phosphatase genes was analyzed by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry in comparison with unstimulated control cells. Adenovirally stimulated cells were transplanted into mechanically generated partial-thickness cartilage lesions in the patellar groove of the rat femur. Quality and integration of the repair tissues were assessed by histochemical and immunohistochemical methods. Results Stimulation with BMP-2 or AdBMP-2 led to an up-regulation of cartilage-specific gene expression in all three cell populations studied, most rapidly and prominently in the perichondrial/periosteal cells, which showed a 3200-fold increase of type II collagen mRNA and reached the highest absolute levels of type II and IX collagen transcripts after stimulation. Similar results were obtained for the bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC), while the respective transcript levels in fat stromal cells declined after an initial more than 30-fold elevation. Following transplantation in vivo, AdBMP-2-infected perichondrial/periosteal cells produced a proteoglycan-rich, type II collagen-positive matrix with only faint staining for type I collagen. The repair tissue originating from AdBMP-2-infected BMSC showed less intense type II collagen staining, but a relatively proteoglycan-rich matrix, weakly positive for type I collagen. Transgene-activated fat stromal cells formed rather fibrous tissue mainly composed of type I collagen. Unstimulated cells of the three different populations gave only rise to fibrous tissue. Conclusions Perichondrium/periosteum-derived cells and BMSC seem superior to cells isolated from fat with respect to forming hyaline cartilaginous tissue. A chondrogenic stimulus, e.g. by transfer of BMP-2 cDNA, appears to be required for initiation and support of chondrogenic differentiation. Copyright ? 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary A plethora of coating techniques have been developed and applied to deposit bioceramic coatings, in particular osseoconductive calcium phosphate coatings on a variety of substrates including metals such as titanium and magnesium and their alloys, austenitic surgical steels, bioinert ceramics such as alumina and zirconia, as well as polymers such as poly(ethylene), poly(etheretherketone), poly(methylmethacrylate), poly(lactic acid), poly(ε-caprolacton), carbon nanotubes and several other materials. These techniques can be generally divided into non-thermal and thermal methods even though in several cases this distinction is not clear-cut. For example, some deposition techniques such as sol?gel deposition, electrochemical deposition (ECD) or electrophoretic deposition require a subsequent heat treatment to convert amorphous calcium phosphate or non-apatitic calcium phosphate phases to crystalline hydroxyapatite with sufficient adhesion to the substrate and pronounced osseoconductive properties.

AB  - Summary Conifers have evolved complex oleoresin terpene defenses against herbivores and pathogens. In co-evolved bark beetles, conifer terpenes also serve chemo-ecological functions as pheromone precursors, chemical barcodes for host identification, or nutrients for insect-associated microbiomes. We highlight the genomic, molecular and biochemical underpinnings of the large chemical space of conifer oleoresin terpenes and volatiles. Conifer terpenes are predominantly the products of the conifer terpene synthase (TPS) gene family. Terpene diversity is increased by cytochromes P450 of the CYP720B class. Many conifer TPS are multiproduct enzymes. Multisubstrate CYP720B enzymes catalyse multistep oxidations. We summarise known terpenoid gene functions in various different conifer species with reference to the annotated terpenoid gene space in a spruce genome. Overall, biosynthesis of terpene diversity in conifers is achieved through a system of biochemical radiation and metabolic grids. Expression of TPS and CYP720B genes can be specific to individual cell types of constitutive or traumatic resin duct systems. Induced terpenoid transcriptomes in resin duct cells lead to dynamic changes of terpene composition and quantity to fend off herbivores and pathogens. While terpenoid defenses have contributed much to the evolutionary success of conifers, under new conditions of climate change, these defences may become inconsequential against range-expanding forest pests.

AB  - The initial mineralization centers during human bone formation onto osteoblasts are composed of CaCO3. Those bioseeds are enzymatically formed via carbonic anhydrase(s) in close association with the cell surface of the osteoblasts. Subsequently, the bicarbonate/carbonate anions are exchanged non-enzymatically by inorganic phosphate [Pi]. One source for the supply of Pi is polyphosphate [polyP] which is a physiological polymer, formed in the osteoblasts as well as in the platelets. The energy-rich acid anhydride bonds within the polyP chain are cleaved by phosphatase(s); during this reaction free-energy might be released that could be re-used, as metabolic fuel, for the maintenance of the steady-state concentrations of the substrates/products during mineralization. Finally it is outlined that polyP, as a morphogenetically active scaffold, is even suitable for 3D cell printing.

AB  - Abstract This chapter focuses on anemias resulting from bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes and on anemias caused by heritable defects in the glycolytic pathway and in the pentose phosphate pathways. The two broad categories of BMF syndromes are those that are acquired and those that are inherited. Advances in different areas of biology have already had impacts on the diagnosis and treatment of BMF and hemolytic anemias. Increasing knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms of how gene transcription is regulated and relevant mechanistic studies focused on genes associated with heritable BMF and hemolytic anemias promise to lead to new therapies. The chapter deals with those enzymopathies affecting red cell metabolism for which the molecular basis has been elucidated. It provides a brief overview of enzymopathies and provides information on deficiencies of pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase - representative of disorders of glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and nucleotide metabolism, respectively.

Identification, characterization, and potential application of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) derived from human dental tissues. Methods ?? Dental pulp and periodontal ligament were obtained from normal human impacted third molars. The tissues were digested in collagenase/dispase to generate single cell suspensions. Cells were cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2?mM l-glutamine, 100??M l-ascorbate-2-phosphate. Magnetic and fluorescence activated cell sorting were employed to characterize the phenotype of freshly isolated and ex vivo expanded cell populations. The developmental potential of cultured cells was assessed following co-transplantation with hydroxyapetite/tricalcium phosphate (HA/TCP) particles into immunocompromised mice for 8?weeks. Results ?? MSC were identified in adult human dental pulp (dental pulp stem cells, DPSC), human primary teeth (stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth, SHED), and periodontal ligament (periodontal ligament stem cells, PDLSC) by their capacity to generate clongenic cell clusters in culture. Ex vivo expanded DPSC, SHED, and PDLSC populations expressed a heterogeneous assortment of makers associated with MSC, dentin, bone, smooth muscle, neural tissue, and endothelium. PDLSC were also found to express the tendon specific marker, Scleraxis. Xenogeneic transplants containing HA/TCP with either DPSC or SHED generated donor-derived dentin-pulp-like tissues with distinct odontoblast layers lining the mineralized dentin-matrix. In parallel studies, PDLSC generated cementum-like structures associated with PDL-like connective tissue when transplanted with HA/TCP into immunocompromised mice. Conclusion ?? Collectively, these data revealed the presence of distinct MSC populations associated with dental structures with the potential of stem cells to regenerate living human dental tissues in vivo.

AB  - Abstract The preparation of porous biomaterials for bone substitution is an important clinical issue in current biomedical technology because the ingrowth of bone can only occur if a suitable number of sufficiently large pores is available. Different procedures are compared here: The combined chemical-thermal treatment of bovine and human cancellous bone, the calcination of bovine cancellous bone, mechanical hole-drilling, and the extraction of porogens (in this case: salt crystals). The inner structure and the porosity of all samples were studied using high-resolution synchrotron ?-computer tomography.

AB  - Abstract Objectives This study aimed to evaluate in a Belgian population the frequence of mucositis and peri-implantitis in patients with implants of at least 5 years of function. Another outcome was to access implants/patients characteristics as possible risk indicators for peri-implantitis. Material and methods One hundred and three patients (38 males/65 females) with a total of 266 implants were examined. Implants had been inserted in university hospitals as well as in private clinics and the mean time of implants in function was 8.5 years (±3.2). The average patients' age within the population was 62 years (±13.4). General health informations were recorded as well as habits regarding smoking, maintenance visits and oral hygiene. Full mouth clinical parameters (PlI, BoP, PPD) were assessed and radiographs taken to determine the periodontal status and implants diagnosis. Results Prevalences of mucositis and peri-implantitis at the patient's level were respectively 31% and 37%. They were 38% and 23% at the implant's level. Subjects older than 65 years (OR = 1.39) and those with active periodontitis (OR = 1.98) were prone to peri-implantitis. The association was stronger for hepatitis (OR = 2.92) and totally edentulous patients (OR = 5.56). Finally, at the implant's level, a significant correlation was found in the multi-level analyses between rough surfaces, overdentures and peri-implantitis. Conclusion After 8.5 years an important proportion (±60%) of implants presented biological complications. Furthermore, a positive correlation was showed between age, periodontitis, absence of teeth, rough surfaces and peri-implantitis. Consequently, patients with such characteristics should be informed before implant placement and frequently re-called after for maintenance visits.

AB  - Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that enhances image contrast by using the susceptibility differences between tissues. It is created by combining both magnitude and phase in the gradient echo data. SWI is sensitive to both paramagnetic and diamagnetic substances which generate different phase shift in MRI data. SWI images can be displayed as a minimum intensity projection that provides high resolution delineation of the cerebral venous architecture, a feature that is not available in other MRI techniques. As such, SWI has been widely applied to diagnose various venous abnormalities. SWI is especially sensitive to deoxygenated blood and intracranial mineral deposition and, for that reason, has been applied to image various pathologies including intracranial hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, stroke, neoplasm, and multiple sclerosis. SWI, however, does not provide quantitative measures of magnetic susceptibility. This limitation is currently being addressed with the development of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and susceptibility tensor imaging (STI). While QSM treats susceptibility as isotropic, STI treats susceptibility as generally anisotropic characterized by a tensor quantity. This article reviews the basic principles of SWI, its clinical and research applications, the mechanisms governing brain susceptibility properties, and its practical implementation, with a focus on brain imaging.

AB  - Total disc replacement using tissue-engineered intervertebral discs (TE-IVDs) may offer a biological alternative to treat radiculopathy caused by disc degeneration. A composite TE-IVD was previously developed and evaluated in rat tail and beagle cervical spine models in vivo. Although cell viability and tissue integration into host tissue were promising, significant implant displacement occurred at multiple spinal levels. The goal of the present study was to assess the effects of a resorbable plating system on the stiffness of motion segments and stability of tissue-engineered implants subjected to axial compression. Canine motion segments from levels C2/C3 to C5/C6 were assessed as intact (CTRL), after discectomy (Dx), with an implanted TE-IVD only (PLATE?), and with a TE-IVD combined with an attached resorbable plate (PLATE+). Segments under PLATE+ conditions fully restored separation between endplates and showed significantly higher compressive stiffness than segments under PLATE? conditions. Plated segments partially restored more than 25% of the CTRL motion segment stiffness. Plate attachment also prevented implant extrusion from the disc space at 50% compressive strain, and this effect was more significant in segments from levels C3/C4 when compared to segments from level C5/C6. These results suggest that stabilization of motion segments via resorbable plating assists TE-IVD retention in the disc space while allowing the opportunity for implants to fully integrate into the host tissue and achieve optimal restoration of spine biomechanics.

AB  - The voltage-gated ?glial? sodium channel NaG belongs to a distinct molecular class within the multi-gene family of mammalian sodium channels. Originally found in central and peripheral glia, NaG has since been detected in neurons in rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and may play a role in Schwann cell-axon interactions. We have studied the presence of NaG-like immunoreactivity in the intact and injured human peripheral nervous system using a specific affinity-purified antibody. Nerve fibres in normal and injured peripheral nerves and normal skin exhibited intense NaG-immunoreactivity. Numerous NaG-immunoreactive nerve fibres surrounded neuronal cell bodies within postmortem control DRG, and in DRG avulsed from the spinal cord (i.e. after traumatic central axotomy). There were no significant differences in the pattern of NaG immunostaining between control and avulsed DRG, or with delay after injury. Generally, the neuronal cell bodies were only very weakly immunoreactive to NaG, indicating that the NaG immunoreactivity was predominantly in Schwann cells/myelin. In accord, we demonstrated NaG immunostaining in cultured human and rat Schwann cells, and in distal nerve after wallerian degeneration. NaG thus appears to be a useful new marker for Schwann cells in the human PNS, and a role in neuropathy deserves investigation.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis To evaluate the efficacy of silk fibroin scaffolds (SFS) and acellular collagen scaffolds (ACS) for the repair of tympanic membrane (TM) in a guinea pig acute perforation model. Study Design Experimental animal research. Methods Seventy-two albino guinea pigs underwent perforation of the right TM and were divided into four experimental groups (n = 18). The perforations were repaired with SFS, ACS, and paper patch using onlay myringoplasty, or they were allowed to heal spontaneously (control). An additional group of 10 guinea pigs without perforation or scaffold was allocated as a normal TM group. Guinea pigs in each experimental group (n = 6) were evaluated at 7, 14, and 28 days following surgery. TM structural healing was evaluated by otomicroscopy and histology, and functional hearing was analyzed by auditory brainstem responses (ABR). Prior to the study, mechanical properties of SFS and ACS were investigated. Results Tensile strength and elasticity of SFS and ACS were within the known range for human TM. Based on otologic and histologic evaluation, TMs treated with SFS or ACS showed complete closure of the perforation at an earlier stage, with a trilaminar structure and more uniform thickness compared to paper patch and control treated groups. ABR assessment demonstrated that SFS or ACS treatment facilitated a faster restoration of hearing function compared to paper patch and control groups. Conclusion The results of this study show that SFS and ACS are effective graft materials and may be utilized as alternatives to current grafts for TM repair. Level of Evidence N/A.

AB  - ABSTRACT Immobilization as a result of long-term bed rest can lead to gradual bone loss. Due to their distribution throughout the bone matrix and remarkable interconnectivity, osteocytes represent the major mechanosensors in bone and translate mechanical into biochemical signals controlling bone remodeling. To test whether immobilization affects the characteristics of the osteocyte network in human cortical bone, femoral diaphyseal bone specimens were analyzed in immobilized female individuals and compared to age-matched postmenopausal individuals with primary osteoporosis. Premenopausal and postmenopausal healthy individuals served as control groups. Cortical porosity, osteocyte number and lacunar area, the frequency of hypermineralized lacunae as well as cortical bone calcium content (CaMean) were assessed using bone histomorphometry and quantitative backscattered electron imaging (qBEI). Bone matrix properties were further analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In the immobilization group, cortical porosity was significantly higher, and qBEI revealed a trend towards higher matrix mineralization compared to osteoporotic individuals. Osteocyte density and canalicular density showed a declining rate from premenopausal towards healthy postmenopausal and osteoporotic individuals with peculiar reductions in the immobilization group, while the number of hypermineralized lacunae accumulated inversely. In conclusion, reduced osteocyte density and impaired connectivity during immobilization are associated with a specific bone loss pattern, reflecting a phenotype clearly distinguishable from postmenopausal osteoporosis. Immobilization periods may lead to a loss of survival signals for osteocytes, provoking bone loss that is even higher than in osteoporosis states, while osteocytic osteolysis remains absent.

AB  - Introduction Equine Type 1 polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM1) is associated with a missense, gain-of-function mutation in the equine skeletal muscle glycogen synthase gene (GYS1). Affected horses have excessive glycogen storage, amylopectate-like inclusions in their muscle and higher muscle glycogen synthase activities (GS) than controls. GS is normally allosterically-regulated by glucose-6-phosphate and enzyme activity is reduced by phosphorylation. We hypothesised that the higher GS activity in PSSM1-affected horses might be due either to 1) increased expression or reduced degradation of the mutant enzyme or 2) due to reduced phosphorylation. Methods Semimembranosus muscle samples were biopsied from 4 homozygotes (HH), 13 heterozygotes (RH) and 12 control (RR) Belgian Draught horses. Samples were analysed for glycogen content and GS activity. Western immunoblotting was used to examine expression of total and phosphorylated forms of GS, GSK3? and GLUT4. Data was analysed using non-parametric ANOVA statistical tests with post-hoc Dunn's multiple comparison tests. Results PSSM1 affected heterozygotes and homozygotes had significantly higher muscle glycogen contents than controls (RR vs. RH P?=?0.005, RR vs. HH P?= 0.041) and GS activity was significantly higher in PSSM1-affected homozygotes than in heterozygotes and control horses (P?=?0.03). Although there was no difference in total GS expression between groups, there was significantly more expression of GS phosphorylated at site 2?+?2a in PSSM1-affected horses in comparison with controls (P?=?0.009). Conclusions Our data suggest that increased GS activity in PSSM1-affected horses is not associated with increased expression or degradation of the mutant enzyme and occurs despite increased phosphorylation of GS at site 2?+?2a. Alternative mechanisms, including aberrant ligand binding might account for the increased GS activity in PSSM1-affected muscle.

AB  - Abstract The peripheral nerve regeneration is still one of the major clinical problems, which has received a great deal of attention. In this study, the electrospun silk fibroin (SF)/poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) nanofibrous scaffolds were fabricated and functionalized their surfaces with laminin (LN) without chemical linkers for potential use in the peripheral nerve tissue engineering. The morphology, surface chemistry, thermal behavior and wettability of the scaffolds were examined to evaluate their performance by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and water contact angle (WCA) measurements, respectively. The proliferation and viability of Schwann cells onto the surfaces of SF/PEO nanofibrous scaffolds were investigated using SEM and thiazolyl blue (MTT) assay. The results showed an improvement of SF conformation and surface hydrophilicity of SF/PEO nanofibers after methanol and O2 plasma treatments. The immunostaining observation indicated a continuous coating of LN on the scaffolds. Improving the surface hydrophilicity and LN functionalization significantly increased the cell proliferation and this was more prominent after 5 days of culture time. In conclusion, the obtained results revealed that the electrospun LN-functionalized SF/PEO nanofibrous scaffold could be a promising candidate for peripheral nerve tissue regeneration. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is growing in popularity for orthopedic, spinal, and trauma applications but has potential significant limitations in use. PEEK is biocompatible, similar in elasticity to bone, and radiolucent, but is inert and therefore does not integrate well with bone. Current efforts are focusing on increasing the bioactivity of PEEK with surface modifications to improve the bone-implant interface. We used a novel Accelerated Neutral Atom Beam (ANAB) technology to enhance the bioactivity of PEEK. Human osteoblast-like cells seeded on ANAB-treated PEEK result in significantly enhanced proliferation compared with control PEEK. Cells grown on ANAB-treated PEEK increase osteogenic expression of ALPL (1.98-fold, p < 0.002), RUNX2 (3.20-fold, p < 0.002), COL1A (1.94-fold, p < 0.015), IBSP (2.78-fold, p < 0.003), and BMP2 (1.89-fold, p < 0.004). Cells grown on these treated surfaces also lead to an increased mineralization (6.4-fold at 21 days, p < 0.0005). In an ovine study, ANAB-treated PEEK implants resulted in enhanced bone-in-contact by 3.09-fold (p < 0.014), increased push-out strength (control 1959?±?1445 kPa; ANAB 4068?±?1197 kPa, p < 0.05), and evidence of bone ingrowth at both the early (4 weeks) and later (12 weeks) time points. Taken together, these data suggest that ANAB treatment of PEEK has the potential to enhance its bioactivity, leading to bone formation and significantly decreasing osseointegration time of orthopedic and spinal implants. ANAB treatment, therefore, may significantly enhance the performance of PEEK medical implants and lead to improved clinical outcomes. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
