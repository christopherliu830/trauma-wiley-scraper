AB  - Summary Hypothalamic obesity is an intractable form of obesity syndrome that was initially described in patients with hypothalamic tumours and surgical damage. However, this definition is now expanded to include obesity developing after a variety of insults, including intracranial infections, infiltrations, trauma, vascular problems and hydrocephalus, in addition to acquired or congenital functional defects in central energy homeostasis in children with the so-called common obesity. The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying hypothalamic obesity are complex and multifactorial. Weight gain results from damage to the ventromedial hypothalamus, which leads, variously, to hyperphagia, a low-resting metabolic rate; autonomic imbalance; growth hormone-, gonadotropins and thyroid-stimulating hormone deficiency; hypomobility; and insomnia. Hypothalamic obesity did not receive enough attention, as evidenced by rarity of studies in this group of patients. A satellite symposium was held during the European Congress of Obesity in May 2011, in Istanbul, Turkey, to discuss recent developments and concepts regarding pathophysiology and management of hypothalamic obesity in children. An international group of leading researchers presented certain aspects of the problem. This paper summarizes the highlights of this symposium. Understanding the central role of the hypothalamus in the regulation of feeding and energy metabolism will help us gain insights into the pathogenesis and management of common obesity.

AB  - Abstract: Background: The acute phase response causes a negative nitrogen balance. It is unknown whether this involves regulation of hepatic urea synthesis. Methods: We examined the in vivo capacity of urea nitrogen synthesis (CUNS), mRNA levels of urea cycle enzyme genes and galactose elimination capacity (GEC) during moderate and severe acute phase response induced by low- and high-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats. Results: Low-dose LPS doubled CUNS (P<0.05), decreased the mRNA level of the rate-limiting urea cycle enzyme (arginino succinate synthetase (ASS) by 26% (P<0.05) and did not change GEC. High-dose LPS did not change CUNS, decreased the mRNA level of the flux-generating enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) by 11% (P<0.05) and the rate-limiting urea cycle enzyme (ASS) by 27% (P<0.05) and almost halved GEC (P<0.05). Conclusion: The moderate acute phase response up-regulated in vivo urea synthesis but had the opposite effect on gene level. The severe acute phase response decreased the functional liver mass that attenuated the increase in urea synthesis.

AB  - The combined radiation-wound injury is a refractory wound with decreased number or dysfunction of repairing cells and growth factors. This remains a challenge in clinical practice. The object of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a combination of human vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (hVEGF165) and human beta-defensin 3 (hBD3) in the treatment of such wounds. A plasmid-carrying hVEGF165 gene and hBD3 gene was used to transfect rat bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). The supernatant from the modified BMSCs significantly promoted the proliferation and cell migration of human endothelial cells and it also inhibited the growth of bacteria and fungus, demonstrating the successful expression of the transfected genes. The hVEGF165/hBD3-modified BMSCs were then injected into the sites of combined radiation-wound injury on rats. It demonstrated that wound-healing time was shortened significantly in the treated rats. The granulation tissue formation/maturation, skin appendage regeneration and collagen deposition were also improved significantly. Strong expression of hVEGF165 and hBD3 was detected in the wound surface at early stage of the healing. The results indicate that topical transplantation of hVEGF165/hBD3-modified BMSCs promoted wound healing, and this gene therapy strategy presents a promising approach in the treatment of refractory wounds such as the combined radiation-wound injury.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides a brief summary of natural history of ursids and practical information on medical management, including the most prevalent concerns for each species and the epidemiology of infectious and parasitic diseases. It focuses entirely on black bears and practitioners are encouraged to consult with brown bear and polar bears experts if working with these species. Bears may require veterinary and rehabilitation assistance for a variety of reasons. The most common causes of admission include orphaning, regulated and nonregulated hunting, weather events, vehicular collisions, dog interactions, and nuisance events. Trauma is a frequent finding on physical exam and surgical intervention is often required. Skin abrasions and lacerations, fractured bones, broken teeth, and damage to internal organs are common injuries in bears. As for any wild animal undergoing medical care or rehabilitation, established criteria should be met before contemplating release.

AB  - Abstract A class of bioactive, stimuli-responsive co-joined interpenetrating networks of inherently conductive polymers and highly hydrated hydrogels are being developed for implantable biodevice interfaces and for electric field induced release of elutable drugs. A novel microfabricated multidisc electrode array biotransducer intended for trauma management has been coated with poly(HEMA)-polypyrrole and characterized by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry using ferrocene monocarboxylic acid (FcCOOH) as a probe molecule. Electrodeposition of polypyrrole (700?mV vs. Ag/AgCl) to 100 mC/cm2 onto the hydrogel coated microdisc electrode array resulted in large and unstable background currents relative to uncoated electrodes. Overoxidation of polypyrrole (0?1.2?V vs. Ag/AgCl, 20 cylces, 100?mV/s) eliminates background current. Dose-response curves with FcCOOH showed that the transducer has good reproducibility with molecules of facile electrochemical properties. Polypyrrole provides interference screening of endogenous interferents in biosensor applications with a 12:1 rejection ratio. GOx was immobilized via electropolymerization of polypyrrole into hydrogel coated MDEA 5037s to yield biotransducers with sensitivity of 0.045?µA?mM?1 cm?2. Changes to improve biotransducer sensitivity are proposed.

AB  - Summary Liver disease in children differs greatly from that in adults. An infant presenting with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia (CHB) or a suspected inherited metabolic disorder (IMD) requires a referral to a specialist liver centre. Patients with liver disease require regular nutritional assessment. The frequency of assessment is determined by the stage and severity of liver disease. The causes of acute liver failure (ALF) include: infective (hepatitis A, B or C, cytomegalo-virus); IMD including haemochromatosis, galactosaemia, tyrosinaemia; toxins/drugs, (parenteral nutrition, chemotherapy or paracetamol overdose); and irradiation (radiotherapy). There are many causes of chronic liver disease (CLD). The chance of requiring liver transplantation increases with advancing age and liver disease progression. Pancreatitis is the result of inflammation within the parenchyma of the pancreas; causes for pancreatitis in children differ from those of adults. Nutrition support is particularly important in acute pancreatitis caused by trauma.

AB  - Abstract M-type (KCNQ2/3) K+ channels play dominant roles in regulation of active and passive neuronal discharge properties such as resting membrane potential, spike-frequency adaptation, and hyper-excitatory states. However, plasticity of M-channel expression and function in nongenetic forms of epileptogenesis are still not well understood. Using transgenic mice with an EGFP reporter to detect expression maps of KCNQ2 mRNA, we assayed hyperexcitability-induced alterations in KCNQ2 transcription across subregions of the hippocampus. Pilocarpine and pentylenetetrazol chemoconvulsant models of seizure induction were used, and brain tissue examined 48?hr later. We observed increases in KCNQ2 mRNA in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons after chemoconvulsant-induced hyperexcitability at 48?hr, but no significant change was observed in dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells. Using chromogenic in situ hybridization assays, changes to KCNQ3 transcription were not detected after hyper-excitation challenge, but the results for KCNQ2 paralleled those using the KCNQ2-mRNA reporter mice. In mice 7?days after pilocarpine challenge, levels of KCNQ2 mRNA were similar in all regions to those from control mice. In brain-slice electrophysiology recordings, CA1 pyramidal neurons demonstrated increased M-current amplitudes 48?hr after hyperexcitability; however, there were no significant changes to DG granule cell M-current amplitude. Traumatic brain injury induced significantly greater KCNQ2 expression in the hippocampal hemisphere that was ipsilateral to the trauma. In vivo, after a secondary challenge with subconvulsant dose of pentylenetetrazole, control mice were susceptible to tonic?clonic seizures, whereas mice administered the M-channel opener retigabine were protected from such seizures. This study demonstrates that increased excitatory activity promotes KCNQ2 upregulation in the hippocampus in a cell-type specific manner. Such novel ion channel expressional plasticity may serve as a compensatory mechanism after a hyperexcitable event, at least in the short term. The upregulation described could be potentially leveraged in anticonvulsant enhancement of KCNQ2 channels as therapeutic target for preventing onset of epileptogenic seizures.

AB  - It has been defined that strong and multispecific cellular immune responses correlate with a better prognosis during the course of chronic diseases. A cross-enhancing effect on the resulting immune response obtained by the coadministration of recombinant hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface and core Ag was recently observed. With the objective of studying the effect of such Ag on the immune response to coinoculated heterologous Ag and vice versa, several formulations containing the recombinant HBV Ag and a multiepitopic protein (CR3) composed by CTL and Th epitopes from HIV-1 were evaluated by s.c. and mucosal administration. Combinations of two and three Ag were evaluated for cellular and humoral immune responses. The results showed that the best Ag combination for nasal immunization was the mixture comprising the CR3 recombinant HIV protein and both HBV Ag. Similarly, it was also the best formulation for s.c. immunization in aluminium phosphate adjuvant. In conclusion, it is possible to induce a Th1 stimulation of the cellular immune response specific for a HIV-based recombinant protein by formulating this Ag with the recombinant HBV Ag.

AB  - Summary. The need for dental materials which bond to all hard tissues of the tooth is an obvious one. The technique of enamel acid etching has made adhesion to enamel possible. In addition, extensive research has allowed the development of dentine-bonding agents, materials that are claimed to bond to dentine. The first and second generation of these products, despite their early success and popularity, pose several problems, including a weak and unstable bond in the oral environment. During the last decade, a number of systems, known as the third generation of dentine-bonding agents, have been marketed. They base their bonding ability on the utilization of the organic part of a pre-treated dentine. In vitro studies have reported significantly higher bond strength, and reduced microleakage and marginal gap formation. Biocompatibility and toxicity studies have demonstrated no direct harmful effect on the pulp. Clinical trials have shown promising clinical performance. These products can offer treatment alternatives in paediatric dentistry; for example, for teeth affected by amelogenesis imperfecta or local hypoplasia, for anterior teeth extensively damaged by decay or trauma, and for teeth with hypersensitive dentine. However, the dentist should be cautious using these systems because, for most of the products, the permanence of the bond in the oral environment has not been extensively studied. Résumé. Le besoin en matériaux dentaires adhérant aux tissus durs de la dent est évident. La Technique utilisant le mordançage par l'acide a rendu l'adhésion à l'émail possible. Une recherche intensive a permis le développement d'agents de liason à la dentine. La première et deuxième génération de ces produits, malgrè un large succès, pose différents problémes, en particulier une liaison faible et instable en milieu buccal. Durant la dernière décade, sont apparus sur le marché de nouveaux systémes de liaison à la dentine, appelés de troisième génération. Leur capacité de liaison est basée sur l'utilisation de la partie organique de la dentine prétraitée. In vitro, les études montreraient une force de liaison significativement supérieure et une réduction des micro-infiltrations et des solutions de continuité du joint marginal. Les études de biocompatibilité et toxicité n'ont pas montré d'effet nocifs sur la pulpe et les études cliniques ont montré des résultats prometteurs en dentisterie pédiatrique. Ces produits peuvent offrir des possibiltiés nouvelles de traitement, notamment pour les cas d'amelogénèes imparfaite, d'hypoplasie, les caries extensives des dents antérieures, les traumatismes et l'hypersensibilité dentinaire. Mais le practicien doit rester prudent dans l'utilisation de ces systémes, la stabilité de la liaison en milieu buccal n'ayant pas encore été étudiée de façon compléte. Zusammenfassung. Der Suche nach einem Material welches sich gut mit alien Hartsubstanzen des Zahnes verbindet ist bekannt. Die Säureätztechnik machte die Verbindung zum Schmelz möglich. Zusätzlich behauptete die Forschung, Materiale entwickelt zu haben, welche sich mit dem Dentin verbinden. Trotz erster Erfolge gab es verschiedene Probleme besonders eine schwache und unstabile Verbindung im Munde. In den lezten 10 Jahren wurden verschiedene Systeme entwickelt bekannt als dritte Generation von Dentinkleber. Die Klebe-Eigenschaften basieren auf den Organischen Teil des vorbehandelten. Dentines. In vitro Studien fand man signifikante höhere Verbindungswerte und keine direkte schädlichen Einfluss auf die Pulpa. Klinische Tests in der Kinderzahrmedizin zeigten vielversprechende klinische Erfolge. Diese Produkte ermöglichen neue Behandlungsmethoden bei allgemeiner und lokalen Hypoplasien. Und für extrem durch Karies oder Trauma geschädigte Milchfrontzähne, wie auch beiüberempfindlichem Dentin. Doch nach wie vor muss der Zahnarzt vorsichtig bleiben, da die meisten Produkte noch ungenügend klinisch getestet wurden. Resumen. Es obvia la necesidad que existe de tener un agente de unión que se una a todos los tejidos duros del diente. La técnica da grabado ácido ha hecho posible la adhesión al esmalte. Además, extensas investigaciones han permitido el desarrollo de agentes de unión dentinarios. La primera y segundo generación de estos agentes, aún cuando obtuvieron buenos resultados y popularidad, presentaron problemas incluyendo una unión débil e inestable en el ambiente oral. Durante la última década, un numero de sistemas, conocidos como de tercera generación, han sido lanzados al mercado. Basan su habilidad para unirse a la dentina en la utilización de la parte orgánica de la dentina pre-tratada. Estudios in vitro han reportado fuerzas de unión significativamente más altas y una reducción en la microfiltración y formación de brechas marginales. Estudios de biocompatibilidad y toxidad han demostrado que no hay ningun efecto da?ino en la pulpa. Estudios clinicos han mostrado resultados prometedores. Estos productos pueden ofrecer alternativas para tratamientos en odontología pediátrica. Por ejemplo, dientes con amelogénesis imperfecta o hipoplasia local, en dientes anteriores cariados o traumatizados y dientes con hipersensibilidad dentinaria. Sin embargo, el odontólogo debe tener cautela porque para la mayoría de los productos la permanencia de la unión en el ambiente oral no ha sido exaustivamente estudiada.

AB  - Abstract Osseointegration (OI) is the direct anchorage of a metal implant into bone, allowing for the connection of an external prosthesis to the skeleton. Osseointegration was first discovered in the 1960s based on the microscopic analysis of titanium implant placed into host bone. New bone was observed to attach directly to the metal surface. Following clinical investigations into dentistry applications, OI was adapted to treat extremity amputations. These bone anchored implants, which penetrate the skin and soft tissues, eliminate many of the challenges of conventional prosthetic sockets, such as poor fit and suspension, skin breakdown, and pain. Osseointegrated implants show promise to improve prosthesis use, pain, and function for amputees. The successful process of transcutaneous metal integration into host bone requires three synergistic systems: the host bone, the metal implant, and the skin-implant interface. All three systems must be optimized for successful incorporation and longevity of the implant. Osseointegration begins during surgical implantation of the metal components through a complex interplay of cellular mechanisms. While implants can vary in design?including the original screw, press fit implants, and compressive osseointegration?they face common challenges to successful integration and maintenance of fixation within the host bone. Overcoming these challenges requires the understanding of the complex interactions between each element of OI. This review outlines (a) the basic components of OI, (b) the science behind both the bone-implant and the skin-implant interfaces, (c) the current challenges of OI, and (d) future opportunities within the field.

AB  - Summary The aim of this study was to analyse the distribution of regulatory and inhibitory mothers against decapentaplegic homologue (Smad) proteins as markers of active transforming growth factor (TGF)-? signalling in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial tissue and to investigate the effect of TGF-? blockade in the development and progression of collagen-induced arthritis. The expression of Smad proteins in synovial tissues from RA, osteoarthritic and healthy controls was analysed by immunohistochemistry. Arthritis was induced in DBA/1 mice by immunization with chicken type-II collagen (CII). TGF-? was blocked in vivo with the specific peptide p17 starting at the time of immunization or on the day of arthritis onset. T cell population frequencies and specific responses to CII were analysed. The expression of cytokines and transcription factors was quantified in spleen and joint samples. Statistical differences between groups were compared using the Mann?Whitney U-test or one-way analysis of variance (anova) using the Kruskal?Wallis test. p-Smad-2/3 and inhibitory Smad-7 expression were detected in RA and control tissues. In RA, most lymphoid infiltrating cells showed nuclear p-Smad-2/3 without Smad-7 expression. Treatment with TGF-? antagonist did not affect clinical severity, joint inflammation and cartilage damage in collagen-induced arthritis. Frequency of T cell subsets, mRNA levels of cytokines and transcription factors, specific proliferation to CII, serum interleukin (IL)-6 and anti-CII antibodies were comparable in p17 and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated groups. The pattern of Smad proteins expression demonstrates active TGF-? signalling in RA synovium. However, specific TGF-? blockade does not have a significant effect in the mice model of collagen-induced arthritis.

AB  - Abstract The receptor of advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a multi-ligand binding protein that was initially described as an AGEs-binding protein. Other proteins, some of them classified as danger signals or alarmins have been described as RAGE ligands. Of note, RAGE shares some of its ligands with some member of the Toll-like receptor family. Once RAGE is engaged by any of its ligands, the receptor is able to trigger robust pro-inflammatory cellular responses. At present, RAGE has emerged as a relevant actor in the onset and development of chronic inflammation, which underlies many human diseases. Key Concepts The receptor of advanced glycation end products is a multi-ligand receptor. RAGE variants are mainly originated by alternative splicing or proteolytic cleavage. RAGE and TLRs share common ligands and signalling pathways. RAGE activation is associated with activation of pro-inflammatory signalling. RAGE activation by AGEs play a key a role in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Most of the misfolded proteins linked to neurodegeneration act as RAGE ligands. RAGE activation plays a key role in the disturbance of endothelial functions and cardiovascular homeostasis. RAGE has been regarded as the bridge association between chronic inflammation and cancer. RAGE activation in tumour cells promotes proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis.
