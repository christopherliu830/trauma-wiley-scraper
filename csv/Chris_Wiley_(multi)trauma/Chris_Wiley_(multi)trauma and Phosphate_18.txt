AB  - Increasing number of uremic patients, who need IHD, is a great challenge for every society but especially for poor and developing countries. The aim of our study is to look if small (not very expensive) increase in IHD adequacy is able to improve standard medical parameters. In 40 patients, treated with IHD for 57.5 (1?185) months, Kt/V was monitored on-line during the middle IHD session in the week, 4 times in each of 6 consecutive months. Measurements of Kt/V based on a conductivity method. In the first month of observation Kt/V was lower (1.09?±?0.02, p?<?0.0009) than in later months, in which Kt/V was ranging from 1.13?±?0.04 to 1.17?±?0.01. Blood morphology was estimated every month. At the beginning of study period, after 3 months, and at the end of studies, dry body mass, BMI, the blood pH and serum concentration of calcium, phosphate, intact PTH, total protein, albumin, cholesterol, iron, ferritin, urea, and creatinine were determined. The increase in Kt/V was accompanied by rising values of Hb (99.1?±?16.6 ? 105.1?±?12.5?g/l, p?=?0.022), Hct (31.6?±?5.2 ? 33.8?±?3.6%, p?=?0.004), MCV (95.9?±?7.7 ? 100.7 fl?±?5.7, p?=?0.000), iron (58.2?±?29.6 ? 73.2?±?27.8??g/dl, p?=?0.002), blood pH before (7.26?±?0.04 ? 7.41?±?0.04, p?=?0.000) and after (7.34?±?0.05 ? 7.48?±?0.05, p?=?0.000) IHD session as well as by decreasing values of PTH [918 (38?3500)? 420 (15?4341)?pg/ml, p?=?0.036]. Statistically unchanged parameters included dry body mass (70.4?±?15.6 ? 70.9?±?16.1?kg), BMI (28.21?±?6.73 ? 28.23?±?6.79?kg/m2), serum concentration of total protein (69.1?±?5.7 ? 70.9?±?4.8?g/l), phosphate (5.72?±?1.50 ? 5.39?±?2.02?mg/dl), cholesterol (203?±?49 ? 191?±?62?mg/dl) and ferritin (740?±?558 ? 632?±?346?ng/dl) as well as WBC (8.60?±?3.89 ? 6.52?±?1.50?K/nl) and PLT (251?±?91 ? 195?±?60?K/nl). There were correlations between Kt/V and serum concentrations of phosphate (r?=?0.370, p?=?0.019), PTH (r?=?0.314, p?=?0.048), ferritin (r?=?0.417, p?=?0.007), Hb (r?=??0.376, p?=?0.017), and Hct (r?=?0.374, p?=??0.017). Our results indicate that even a small increase in IHD adequacy leads to beneficial changes in management of uremic patients (better response on erythropoietin, diminished laboratory features of secondary hyperparathyroidism, better iron utilization). Correlation between Kt/V and examined parameters indicate that higher IHD doses were provided to patients in more advanced uremic state. It may partially explain advantages observed with incremental IHD adequacy.

AB  - Abstract Study of cell-biomaterial interaction is a crucial aspect of bone tissue engineering to find a state-of-the-art functional substitute. In present study, the Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (hWJ-MSCs) behavior on three-dimensional biomimetic nano-hydroxyapatite/chitosan/gelatin (nHA/CS/Gel) scaffolds was investigated. The outcome was assessed by histological, biochemical and morphological tests. Results indicated that hWJ-MSCs attached onto the scaffold surface through membrane filopodia, uniformly spread throughout the contacting surface. It only took 3 days for the seeded cells to appear deep inside the scaffold, reflecting proper hWJ-MSCs adhesion and migration, evidenced by both scanning electron microscope and hematoxilin and eosin assessments. Additionally, the present fabricated nHA/CS/Gel scaffold proved to be non-toxic as it supported cell proliferation measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazoyl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Moreover, 3-week culture of hWJ-MSCs on scaffolds, immersed in osteogenic medium, rendered the microenvironment in favor of hWJ-MSCs differentiation into osteoblast cells and extracellular matrix secretion. Finally, osteoblasts were immunologically positive for various osteogenic markers including osteocalcin, osteopontin, osteonectin, and alkaline phosphatase. Present findings indicate that nHA/CS/Gel scaffold appropriately harbored hWJ-MSCs, stimulating their growth, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. hWJ-MSCs-loaded nHA/CS/gel substitute may therefore be considered as a suitable platform for the rising demand in in vivo bone repair studies. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Many of the topical products noted can be considered ?natural?, such as chitosan, collagen, and alginates. This chapter focuses on a few of the basic natural products used in wound care, including, honey, sugar, yeast extract, and aloe vera. Large areas of necrotic tissue are best surgically debrided prior to application of honey and sugar. Leeches have been used in an attempt to manage hemodynamic imbalance or venous insufficiency in compromised skin. In an attempt to reduce venous stasis, leeches were applied to the tail wound daily over a 4-day period. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been described for medical uses. The medical uses include orthopedics, sports medicine, dentistry, otolaryngology, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, urogenital surgery, burns and wound healing, cardiothoracic surgery, and maxillofacial surgery. The primary clinical application of PRP is to promote wound healing by increasing the local concentration of growth factors involved in the migration, proliferation, and maturation at the site of injury.

AB  - Abstract Applications in additive manufacturing technologies for bone tissue engineering applications requires the development of new biomaterials formulations. Different three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies can be used and polymers are commonly employed to fabricate 3D printed bone scaffolds. However, these materials used alone do not possess an effective osteopromotive potential for bone regeneration. A growing number of studies report the combination of polymers with minerals in order to improve their bioactivity. This review exposes the state-of-the-art of existing 3D printed composite biomaterials combining polymers and minerals for bone tissue engineering. Characterization techniques to assess scaffold properties are also discussed. Several parameters must be considered to fabricate a 3D printed material for bone repair (3D printing method, type of polymer/mineral combination and ratio) because all of them affect final properties of the material. Each polymer and mineral has its own advantages and drawbacks and numerous composites are described in the literature. Each component of these composite materials brings specific properties and their combination can improve the biological integration of the 3D printed scaffold. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objectives: To describe systemic glucocorticoid usage in cats and dogs by three primary care -veterinary practices in England and to ascertain risk factors for clinical use. To evaluate consistency of prescribing patterns across clinics. To validate a merged database of primary veterinary clinical data as a functional tool for clinical epidemiological research. Methods: A merged database was established from clinical data on 31,273 cat and dog consultations with pharmacotherapy from three veterinary practices in England. Descriptive statistics described systemic glucocorticoid drug use in cats and dogs while mixed-effects logistic regression modelling evaluated risk factors. Individual clinic usage was compared. Results: Overall, 1877 (16·68%) cat consultations and 2913 (14·55%) dog consultations resulted in systemic glucocorticoid therapy. Cats received higher parenteral (P<0·0001) and oral (P<0·0001) dose levels than dogs. Pathophysiological indication, age, skin condition, sex and clinic attended were significant risk factors for glucocorticoid prescription. Clinics varied widely in their odds of systemic glucocorticoid usage (P<0·0001). Clinical Significance: An evidence base for systemic glucocorticoid prescribing by primary care small animal practices in England is provided. Clinic attended was a significant risk factor, indicating wide variation in prescribing patterns between clinics. A merged primary care veterinary clinical database was effective for epidemiological research.

AB  - ABSTRACT Arthrofibrosis is a common complication following total knee arthroplasty caused by pathologic fibroblast activation and excessive collagen deposition around a synovial joint leading to debilitating loss of motion. Treatment options are limited because the pathologic mechanisms remain to be characterized. Dysregulation of the inflammatory cascade may lead to communication between myofibroblasts and immune cells triggering tissue metaplasia, and excessive collagen deposition described clinically as arthrofibrosis. We explored the novel use of celecoxib (selective cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2] inhibitor) to disrupt the downstream effects of the post-traumatic inflammatory cascade and inhibit scar tissue formation in a validated rabbit model of arthrofibrosis combined with new parameters for quantifying the stiffness of the posterior capsule. Biomechanical and molecular analyses, of contracted rabbit knee posterior capsule tissue after COX-2 inhibition revealed increased maximal passive extension and down-regulation of collagen messenger RNA compared with controls. Histopathologic examination suggested a trend of decreased quantities of dense fibrous connective tissue with COX-2 inhibition. These data may suggest that inhibiting the inflammatory cascade could potentially reduce pathologic myofibroblast activation, thereby reducing scar tissue formation and increasing the range of motion in arthrofibrotic joints. Implementing a multi-modal pharmacologic approach may simultaneously target numerous cellular components contributing to the complex process of arthrofibrogenesis. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) following cerebral aneurysm rupture or trauma can result in the induction of secondary ischaemic brain damage via a decrease in microvascular perfusion, a disruption of the blood-brain barrier and consequent vasogenic oedema, and the delayed spasm of the major cerebral arteries (i.e. vasospasm). It is increasingly apparent that oxygen radical-induced, iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation (LP) within the subarachnoid blood and vascular wall plays a key role in the occurrence of these secondary events. Tirilazad mesylate is a potent cytoprotective inhibitor of LP that works by a combination of radical scavenging and membrane stabilizing properties. It has been demonstrated to attenuate the acute and delayed vascular consequences of SAH and to protect the brain against ischaemic insults. Much of its action is mediated by an effect on the vascular endothelium, although it also appears to exert some direct neuro????protection and to inhibit LP in the subarachnoid blood. These actions of tirilazad in experimental SAH are reviewed.

AB  - Summary The study of stress, fear and anxiety was the major focus of research among the early neuroscientists interested in behaviour. This is not surprising because fear, anxiety and alarm play a fundamental role in survival. Thus, research investigating the phenomenology and neurobiology of anxiety, fear, startle, arousal, alarm, vigilance and alerting functions has been conducted for decades. This chapter provides an overview of panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post traumatic stress disorder. These anxiety disorders were selected because each of them has an extensive base of knowledge in two or more of the following areas: neurochemistry, neuroendocrinology or neuroimmunology, and neurophysiology.

AB  - Abstract New quantum theory completed the fall of the 19th century edifice of science and seemed to bar any new edifice based on Baconian scientific method and the deterministic systematics of scientific knowledge. The trauma of relativism, indeterminacy, and operational probabilism that inspired the growth of the Vienna Circle occurred as the academic citadel of science was destroyed by political and economic upheaval. Operational reunification of the sciences by quantum theory has proceeded for decades, but new normative thinking is needed to survive backlash from an age of Big Science. Quantum biology and some potentials of other research are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Developmental and trauma-induced mechanism(s) that modify inflammation and immune responses in blood cells were recently found to be regulated by acetylcholine. Here, we report corresponding blood cell-specific changes in acetylcholinesterase splice variants. Plasmon resonance and flow cytometry using acetylcholinesterase variant-specific antibody probes, revealed a progressive increase in myeloid cell fractions expressing the apoptosis-related acetylcholinesterase-S variant from newborns to adult controls and post-delivery mothers. Hematopoietic cell fractions positive for the myeloproliferative acetylcholinesterase-R variant, were similarly high in post-partum blood, both intracellular and on the cell surface. Moreover, intracellular acetylcholinesterase-S protein amounts as reflected by fluorescence intensity measurements remained unchanged in myeloid cells from post-partum mothers as compared with matched controls. Unlike brain neurons, which over-express intracellular acetylcholinesterase-R under stress, lymphocytes from post-partum mothers presented increased surface acetylcholinesterase-S and pronounced decreases in both the expression and contents of surface acetylcholinesterase-R. Peripheral stimuli-induced modulations in acetylcholine regulation may hence reflect blood cell lineage-dependent acetylcholinesterase splice variations.
