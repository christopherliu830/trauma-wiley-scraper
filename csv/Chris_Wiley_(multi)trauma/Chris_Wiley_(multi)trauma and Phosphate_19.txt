AB  - Abstract The increased content of soluble glycosaminoglycan-containing forms in sciatic nerves during recovery from crush injury [Shum & Chau (1996) J. Neurosci. Res., 46, 465] suggests that the glycosaminoglycans modulate the environment for post-traumatic tissue remodelling and axonal regrowth. To test this, defined amounts of soluble heparan sulphates from bovine kidney or guinea-pig nerve were introduced into the regenerating environment via silicone conduits that bridged 8-mm gaps of transected sciatic nerves of adult guinea-pigs. Controls were bridged using the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) vehicle or a chondroition sulphate preparation from whale cartilage. After timed periods of recovery, the animals were assessed for electromyographic signals at the target gastrocnemius muscle to determine the conduction velocity across the bridged nerve. Sections of the bridge were also histologically examined for nerve fibres. Transected sciatic nerves bridged with heparan sulphates or chondroitin sulphate showed earlier stimulated myelination of axons (week 5?6) than PBS-bridged nerves (week 9). Initial electromyographic indication of reconnection with the target was at week 9 post-transection. In the course of 20?weeks, transected sections of the bridge indicated similar numbers of unmyelinated axons irrespective of bridge material, but distinctly higher numbers of myelinated axons in heparan sulphate-bridged nerves than either PBS- or chondroitin sulphate-bridged nerves. At the end of the same period, heparan sulphate-bridged nerves resumed normal conduction velocities, but both PBS- and chondroitin sulphate-bridged nerves remained at 50% of that of the intact contralateral nerves. These results are the first to demonstrate that supplementation of soluble heparan sulphate to the fluid regenerative neural environment can restore functional, axonal reconnection of the severed nerve with the target muscle.

AB  - Cartilage engineering facilitates repair and regeneration of damaged cartilage using engineered tissue that restores the functional properties of the impaired joint. The seed cells used most frequently in tissue engineering, are chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells. Seed cells activity plays a key role in the regeneration of functional cartilage tissue. However, seed cells undergo undesirable changes after in vitro processing procedures, such as degeneration of cartilage cells and induced hypertrophy of mesenchymal stem cells, which hinder cartilage tissue engineering. Compared to monoculture, which does not mimic the in vivo cellular environment, co-culture technology provides a more realistic microenvironment in terms of various physical, chemical, and biological factors. Co-culture technology is used in cartilage tissue engineering to overcome obstacles related to the degeneration of seed cells, and shows promise for cartilage regeneration and repair. In this review, we focus first on existing co-culture systems for cartilage tissue engineering and related fields, and discuss the conditions and mechanisms thereof. This is followed by methods for optimizing seed cell co-culture conditions to generate functional neo-cartilage tissue, which will lead to a new era in cartilage tissue engineering.

AB  - Aims Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of motor neurons, muscle weakness, spasticity, paralysis and death usually within 2?5 years of onset. Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of ALS pathology characterized by activation of glial cells, which respond by upregulating small heat shock proteins (HSPBs), but the exact underlying pathological mechanisms are still largely unknown. Here, we investigated the association between ALS disease duration, lower motor neuron loss, TARDNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology, neuroinflammation and HSPB expression. Methods With immunohistochemistry, we examined HSPB1, HSPB5, HSPB6, HSPB8 and HSP16.2 expression in cervical, thoracic and sacral spinal cord regions in 12 ALS cases, seven with short disease duration (SDD), five with moderate disease duration (MDD), and ten age-matched controls. Expression was quantified using ImageJ to examine HSP expression, motor neuron numbers, microglial and astrocyte density and phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43+) inclusions. Results SDD was associated with elevated HSPB5 and 8 expression in lateral tract astrocytes, while HSP16.2 expression was increased in astrocytes in MDD cases. SDD cases had higher numbers of motor neurons and microglial activation than MDD cases, but similar levels of motor neurons with pTDP-43+ inclusions. Conclusions Increased expression of several HSPBs in lateral column astrocytes suggests that astrocytes play a role in the pathogenesis of ALS. SDD is associated with increased microgliosis, HSPB5 and 8 expression in astrocytes, and only minor changes in motor neuron loss. This suggests that the interaction between motor neurons, microglia and astrocytes determines neuronal fate and functional decline in ALS.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2011) 119, 1052?1063. Abstract Mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs) improve functional outcome in a number of disease models through suppression of inflammation. However, their effects on neuroinflammation are unknown. In this study, we show that MSCs suppress endotoxin-induced glial activation in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs). Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated OHSCs activated MSCs to increase the expression of cyclo-oxygenase-2 and produce prostaglandin E2. MSC-derived prostaglandin E2, then suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine production by the OHSCs. Together, the results suggest the potential anti-inflammatory mechanism of MSCs in models of disease and support earlier observations that MSCs may offer a therapy for neuroinflammation produced by trauma or disease.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) produces a rapid and excessive elevation in extracellular glutamate that induces excitotoxic brain cell death. The peptide neurotransmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) is reported to suppress neurotransmitter release through selective activation of presynaptic group?II metabotropic glutamate receptors. Therefore, strategies to elevate levels of NAAG following brain injury could reduce excessive glutamate release associated with TBI. We hypothesized that the NAAG peptidase inhibitor, ZJ-43 would elevate extracellular NAAG levels and reduce extracellular levels of amino acid neurotransmitters following TBI by a group?II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-mediated mechanism. Dialysate levels of NAAG, glutamate, aspartate and GABA from the dorsal hippocampus were elevated after TBI as measured by in vivo microdialysis. Dialysate levels of NAAG were higher and remained elevated in the ZJ-43 treated group (50?mg/kg, i.p.) compared with control. ZJ-43 treatment also reduced the rise of dialysate glutamate, aspartate, and GABA levels. Co-administration of the group?II mGluR antagonist, LY341495 (1?mg/kg, i.p.) partially blocked the effects of ZJ-43 on dialysate glutamate and GABA, suggesting that NAAG effects are mediated through mGluR activation. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that inhibition of NAAG peptidase may reduce excitotoxic events associated with TBI.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2010) 115, 92?101. Abstract Prolonged seizures activate members of the Bcl-2 homology domain 3-only sub-group of the Bcl-2 protein family, which are essential for initiation of apoptosis signaling. Bid is a potent pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology domain 3-only protein, which upon proteolytic activation translocates to mitochondria to promote activation of the Bax/Bak sub-group of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family and thereby contributes to release of apoptogenic molecules, such as cytochrome c and possibly apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Bid-deficient mice have been reported to show reduced lesion volumes after ischemia and trauma in vivo but a causal role for Bid in the setting of seizure-induced neuronal death has not been investigated. In this study, we studied Bid activation following status epilepticus in mice and compared hippocampal damage between wild-type and Bid-deficient animals. Full-length Bid was detected in normal mouse hippocampus and the cleaved (activated) p15 fragment of Bid was detected shortly after status epilepticus. Bid-deficient mice underwent equivalent electrographic seizure responses during status epilepticus as wild-type animals. Hippocampal counts of degenerating neurons and surviving neuron-specific nuclear protein-positive cells were not significantly different between wild-type and Bid-deficient mice. Additionally, nuclear translocation of AIF was not reduced in Bid-deficient compared with wild-type animals subjected to status epilepticus. The present study demonstrates that AIF is not dependent on Bid for mitochondrial release and nuclear import in this model and that while Bid is cleaved during seizure-induced neuronal death, it may be functionally redundant or even not essential.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents a case study of a 78-year-old woman who was brought to the emergency department (ED) by emergency medical service (EMS) with a chief complaint of a fall resulting in right wrist pain. The functional status of geriatric patients is dependent on multiple aspects of the individual patient, including things such as medical, physical, cognitive, and environmental issues. Functional decline as measured by various ADLs is an important factor in precipitating many ED visits as well, particularly those mobility related activities of daily living (ADLs). Direct observation of functional capabilities via performance testing of gait, gait speed, strength, and balance capabilities is the best method to assess such function, as both patients and physicians are poor predictors of functional limitations. Incorporating functional assessment into the multidisciplinary team approach such as that proposed by the new geriatric emergency department guidelines may help improve outcomes and prevent future adverse events.

AB  - Summary Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in around10-20%of patients admitted to hospital, and is most often due to hypovolaemia/hypotension, sepsis and nephrotoxins. This chapter summarizes stage-based management of AKI. It also summarizes monitoring and supportive care in AKI. Three common scenarios are encountered: corrected hypovolaemia/hypotension, with improving renal function; persisting/worsening AKI despite correction of hypovolaemia/hypotension and removal of nephrotoxins; and suspected urinary tract obstruction. Prompt and vigorous correction of hypovolaemia and hypotension will often reverse AKI. If there is clinically obvious hypovolaemia, IV fluid is given. Treatment of the trigger of deterioration and avoidance of hypovolaemia (preferably by albumin administration) can help to decrease the incidence of AKI. A CVP line may be helpful (to avoid over-replacement of fluid), but the patient should be resuscitated first before this is placed. Ultrasonography of the inferior vena cava is one of the methods to assess the CVP.

AB  - Regenerative medicine has sparked interest in potential strategies for bone repair. Bone defects are widespread and could be caused by trauma, congenital malformations, infections, and surgery. Although bone has a large self-healing capacity, some defects or fractures are too big to regenerate. To regenerate bone structures which can be used for treatment of patients, bone growth must be induced by a number of bioactive implantable materials, cell types and intracellular, and extracellular molecular signaling pathways. Since mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their differentiation during remodeling processes have important roles in bone regeneration, it is believed that understanding molecular signaling pathways involved is crucial to the development of bone implants, bone substitute materials, and cell-based scaffolds for bone regeneration. In this review, we briefly introduce concepts in fracture repair and regeneration following bone injuries, and then discuss the current clinical methods in bone regeneration. In the next section, we review the involvement of the various key signaling pathways in bone regeneration.

The depth, breadth, and future of our specialty and our practice are reflected in these brief research summaries; the creativity, talent, and dedication of our researcher colleagues are documented on these pages. We are honored to be able to share them with you. This year, 990 abstracts were received and considered for presentation at the Annual Meeting. Fifty percent were submitted electronically. Each abstract was evaluated by six to nine independent reviewers who were blinded to the author, the study institution, and the other reviewers. Final determinations for acceptance were made by members of the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by Judd Hollander, and the Program Committee chair, Sue Stern. These decisions were based on the mean score received after review and the space available for presentations within the program. The type of presentation (oral platform vs poster), the assigned topic section, and the position of presentation in the program were also determined. As was the case last year, we have reproduced these abstracts from electronic versions supplied by the submitting authors. In general, we have not edited, proofread, changed, or corrected the abstracts; they appear as submitted by the authors, who are responsible for their content. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. The institution listed is that of the presenting author. A list of common abbreviations used in the abstracts begins on page 596. An index to key words, authors, and topics begins on page 598.

AB  - Abstract Native bone extracellular matrix (ECM) secreted by mesenchymal precursors provides an optimal biological framework, comprising structural collagen proteins and a microenvironment niche, which supports cell attachment and differentiation, and bone growth. Inspired by nature, the embryonic-like mineralized ECM/stem cell microspheroids (MECS) are developed, in which self-assembly of the stem cell microspheroids (CS) and mineralization of the self-produced ECM occur simultaneously. The uniform-sized MECS exhibit a solid spherical appearance with stem cells embedded inside, recapitulating the early stage of intramembranous ossification. Compared with pure CS, MECS show enhanced Young's modulus, cell viability, intercellular communication, and osteogenic differentiation. Additionally, the capability of MECS is explored without the use of exogenous scaffolds to substitute and repair lost bone in rat critical-sized defects. It is found that the MECS can achieve excellent bone regeneration outcomes with 97.99 ± 2.28% of the defect area filled with new bony structures and blood vessels, while nearly half or one-third of the defect area is repaired by CS (52.79 ± 4.63%) or ?-tricalcium phosphate (38.09 ± 7.79%), respectively. The study demonstrates that embryonic-like MECS is a novel effective bone graft substitute for bone tissue regeneration.

AB  - Objectives To review available information regarding in-office procedures for benign vocal fold lesions (BVFL). Methods PubMed term search on office/awake laryngeal procedures for any of the following specific lesions: Reinke's edema (RE), polyps, nodules, varices, vocal process granuloma, and vocal fold (VF) scar. Results In-office ablative and nonablative laser procedures have been described for BVFL, including RE, polyps, varices, and granuloma. Fiber-based lasers used include potassium titanyl phosphate, pulsed dye laser, and more recently CO2. In-office intralesional steroid injection (ISI) for BVFL targets the inflammatory process involved with the lesion and may induce regression of polyps, nodules, RE, and granuloma. Botulinum toxin-induced ?voice rest? has been described as adjunctive treatment for refractory VF nodules or vocal process granuloma. Most in-office techniques for treating BVFL rely on induction of lesion regression rather than complete lesion removal, as in conventional operative microsurgery. When treating VF scarring, in-office procedures aim to alter the wound-healing process; ISI targets the inflammatory phase and angiolytic lasers target the proliferative phase. Conclusion In-office procedures for BVFL apply new technology that can potentially lower risk and cost. Although numerous case series have shown the potential of these procedures, data that thoroughly compares outcomes with those of microlaryngoscopic techniques is needed.

AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative disease that commonly affects the elderly. Current drug therapies for treating OA may cause adverse side effects, and so there remains a need to develop alternative treatments. Bergapten (BG) is a coumarin phytohormone that is widely found in fruits and has antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. Here, we tested the hypothesis that BG may restrict the progression of OA by examining its effect on OA chondrocytes. We observed that BG significantly ameliorated interleukin (IL)-1?-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines and mediators, including interleukin 1 (Il-1), interleukin 6 (Il-6), tumor necrosis factor α (Tnf-α), cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2) and matrix metalloproteinase 13 (Mmp-13), maintained chondrocyte phenotype, and promoted the secretion of cartilage-specific extracellular matrix. We provide evidence that BG exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by activating the ANP32A/ATM signaling pathway, which was recently verified to be associated with OA. In conclusion, these findings indicate that BG may be a potential candidate for treatment of OA.

AB  - There is a growing interest in the use of daily dialysis since long-term experiences have shown good results. Online hemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) is an HDF technique that combines diffusion with high convection in which the ultrapure dialysis fluid itself is used as a reinfusion solution. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the beneficial effect of the more effective dialysis schedule (daily dialysis) with the dialysis modality that offers the highest uremic toxin removal (OL-HDF). Five children with left ventricular hypertrophy, mean age 12.3?±?6.2 years, on standard 3??4?h 3 times a week OL-HDF at least during the last 6 months, were switched to D-OL-HDF, 3??4?h 6 times per week with a minimal follow up of 6 months. Dialysis parameters were similar during both periods and only frequency of each session was changed. Tolerance, anemia control, phosphatemia, and phosphate binders, need of blood pressure medications, and left ventricular hypertrophy were evaluated. Only 3 of the 5 enrolled children could be followed 12 months, 1 was transplanted after 3 months, the other after 5 months D-OL-HDF. For all the children the disappearance of postdialysis fatigue was rapidly reported. There was a significant decrease in predialysis levels of phosphatemia (from 1.67±0.23 to 1.28±0.29?mmol/L) despite phosphate binders reduction of more than 50%. Hemoglobin significantly increased (from 11.8±0.9 to 13.4±1.3?g percentage ml) allowing EPO doses reduction. Left ventricular hypertrophy disappeared after 6 months D-OL-HDF, fractional shortening increased, allowing registration on transplantation list for 1 child. Our results clearly demonstrate that daily online HDF is able to offer to children on chronic dialysis a marked reduction of the cardiovascular risk factors. Is it ethical to reserve this dialysis modality only to selected children?
