AB  - Objective: To evaluate and describe biochemical indices of bone metabolism in 4 children on NHD. Method:The children, aged 12, 13, 14, and 16?yrs, have been treated exclusively on NHD for 6, 9, 9, and 15?mos. Subsequently, Pt 1 converted to a hybrid program of 4 nights on home nocturnal plus 1 session of in center conventional HD per week. Biochemical indices of bone metabolism have been collected prospectively. Results:All baseline pre-dialysis calcium levels were within normal ranges and each patient was started on a dialysis calcium concentration of 3.0?mEq/L. However, over time the number of asymptomatic biochemical hypocalcaemic episodes increased. The dialysate calcium concentration was increased to 3.5?mEq/L in one and decreased to 2.0?mEq/L in another who was hypercalcemic and receiving concurrent calcitonin for bone pain related to osteoporosis. In Pt 1, the dialysate calcium was increased to 3.5?mEq/L during nocturnal and continued on hybrid therapy. Including an evaluation of dietary intake, all 4 patients had a net positive calcium balance, ranging between 9.8 to 23.5?mmol (393?942?mg). A significant reduction in the predialysis phosphate level was observed in all 4 patients, and none required dietary restrictions or the use of phosphate binders within 2 months or vitamin D within 6 months of HND. In addition, phosphate was added to provide a dialysate concentration of 2.4?6.1?mEq/L to prevent hypophosphatemia. This is reflected by significant reductions in intact PTH levels to the desired range (twice the normal range) in all 4, but the level continued to drop to the normal range and below in 2. In Pt 1, after introduction of hybrid therapy, both levels of phosphate and PTH rose, necessitating recommencement of phosphate binders and vitamin D. Likewise, the (Ca???PO4) dropped and remained <55 in all 4 patients exclusively on NHD, but started to climb in Pt 1 during hybrid therapy. Conclusion:In our cohort of patients, NHD rapidly lowered plasma phosphate and PTH levels. With NHD, additional dialysate phosphate and possibly calcium may be necessary to prevent chronic losses and development of renal osteodystrophy, and caution is required to prevent either oversuppression of PTH and extraskeletal calcification.

AB  - Abstract Purpose of review Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in U.S. Since the last decade, there have been several advances in the understanding and management of TBI that have shown the potential to improve outcomes. The aim of this review is to provide a useful overview of these potential diagnostic and treatment strategies that have yet to be proven, along with an assessment of their impact on outcomes after a TBI. Recent findings Recent technical advances in the management of a TBI are grounded in a better understanding of the pathophysiology of primary and secondary insult to the brain after a TBI. Hence, clinical trials on humans should proceed in order to evaluate their efficacy and safety. Summary Mortality associated with TBI remains high. Nonetheless, new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques have the potential to enhance early detection and prevention of secondary brain insult.

AB  - Abstract This report describes a new approach for fabricating microchannels within three-dimensional electrospun constructs. These key features serve to mimic the fascicular architecture and fibrous extracellular matrix found in native nerve. Both electrospun fibers and multi-channeled structure nerve guides have become areas of increasing interest for their beneficial roles in nerve repair. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a guide that incorporates both. Multiple parallel channels provide a greater number of defined paths and increased surface area compared to cylindrical guides. Additionally, the fibrous nature of electrospun fibers permits better mass transport than solid-walled constructs. The flexible fabrication scheme allows tailoring of nerve guide parameters such as channel diameters ranging from 33 to 176?µm and various wall thicknesses. Channel and fiber structures were assessed by optical and electron microscope images. Geometric calculations estimated a porosity of over 85% for these guides with 16% or less from the channels. In vitro culture with Schwann cells demonstrated cellular infiltration into channels with restricted migration between fibers. Finally, cell proliferation and survival throughout the guide indicates that this design warrants future in vivo examination. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2012; 109:1571?1582. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Early life trauma is a risk factor for life-long disorders related to emotional processing, but knowledge underlying its enduring effect is incomplete. This study was motivated by the hypothesis that early life trauma increases amygdala-dependent threat responses via reduction in inhibition by parvalbumin (PV) interneurons and perineuronal nets (PNN) supporting PV cells, thus increasing excitability of the basolateral amygdala (BLA). From postnatal day (PN) 8?12, rat pups of both sexes were reared under normal bedding or under insufficient nest-building materials to induce maternal-to-infant maltreatment trauma (Scarcity-Adversity Model, SAM). At weaning age of PN23, the SAM group exhibited increased threat responses to predator odor. The SAM-induced increase in threat response was recapitulated in normally reared PN22?23 rats that were unilaterally depleted of PNN in the BLA by the enzymes, chondroitinase-ABC plus hyaluronidase at PN19?20. Light and electron microscopic analysis of the BLA revealed that anterior-to-mid levels of SAM group's BLAs exhibited decreased PNN intensity and decreased axo-somatic synapses between PV-to-principal pyramidal-like neurons and PV-to-PV. PV and PNN densities (cells/mm2) in the BLA of both control (CON) and SAM groups were still low at PN12 and SAM delayed the ontogenetic rise of PV intensity and PNN density. Moreover, PV cell density in the anterior-to-mid BLA correlated negatively with threat response of CON animals, but not for SAM animals. Thus, reduction of PNN-supported, PV-mediated somatic inhibition of pyramidal cells provides a mechanistic support for the enduring effect of early life maltreatment manifested as increasing innate threat response at weaning.

AB  - Transplant vasculopathy (TV) represents the main cause of late graft failure and limits the long-term success of organ transplantation. Cellular and humoral immune responses contribute to the pathogenesis of the concentric and diffuse intimal hyperplasia of arteries of the grafted organ. We recently reported that the mitogenic signaling, evoked in human vascular smooth muscle cells (hmSMC) by the anti-HLA class I monoclonal antibody W6/32, implicates neutral sphingomyelinase-2, suggesting a role for sphingolipids in intimal hyperplasia of TV. Here, we investigated whether the mitogenic sphingolipid, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), is involved in intimal hyperplasia elicited by W6/32. Studies were done on cultured hmSMC and on an in vivo model of TV, consisting of human mesenteric arteries grafted into SCID/beige mice, injected weekly with W6/32. hmSMC migration and DNA synthesis elicited by W6/32 were inhibited by the sphingosine kinase-1 (SK1) inhibitor dimethylsphingosine, the anti-S1P antibody Sphingomab and the S1PR1/R3 inhibitor VPC23019. W6/32 stimulated SK1 activity, while siRNA silencing SK1, S1PR1 and S1PR3 inhibited hmSMC migration. In vivo, Sphingomab significantly reduced the intimal thickening induced by W6/32. These data emphasize the role of S1P in intimal hyperplasia elicited by the humoral immune response, and open perspectives for preventing TV with S1P inhibitors.

AB  - Summary Acute lung injury (ALI) is a heterogeneous disease with the hallmarks of alveolar capillary membrane injury, increased pulmonary oedema and pulmonary inflammation. The most common direct aetiological factor for ALI is usually parenchymal lung infection or haemorrhage. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX2) are thought to play an important role in the pathophysiology of ALI. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) plays an important role both in production of ROS as well as their removal through the supply of NADPH. However, how G6PD modulation affects NOX2-mediated ROS in the airway epithelial cells (AECs) during acute lung injury has not been explored previously. Therefore, we investigated the effect of G6PD inhibitor, 6-aminonicotinamide on G6PD activity, NOX2 expression, ROS production and enzymatic anti-oxidants in AECs in a mouse model of ALI induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ALI led to increased G6PD activity in the AECs with concomitant elevation of NOX2, ROS, SOD1 and nitrotyrosine. G6PD inhibitor led to reduction of LPS-induced airway inflammation, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein concentration as well as NOX2-derived ROS and subsequent oxidative stress. Conversely, ALI led to decreased glutathione reductase activity in AECs, which was normalized by G6PD inhibitor. These data show that activation of G6PD is associated with enhancement of oxidative inflammation in during ALI. Therefore, inhibition of G6PD might be a beneficial strategy during ALI to limit oxidative damage and ameliorate airway inflammation.

AB  - Summary Efficient early identification of primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) is important for prognosis, but is not an easy task for non-immunologists. The Clinical Working Party of the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) has composed a multi-stage diagnostic protocol that is based on expert opinion, in order to increase the awareness of PID among doctors working in different fields. The protocol starts from the clinical presentation of the patient; immunological skills are not needed for its use. The multi-stage design allows cost-effective screening for PID within the large pool of potential cases in all hospitals in the early phases, while more expensive tests are reserved for definitive classification in collaboration with an immunologist at a later stage. Although many PIDs present in childhood, others may present at any age. The protocols presented here are therefore aimed at both adult physicians and paediatricians. While designed for use throughout Europe, there will be national differences which may make modification of this generic algorithm necessary.

AB  - ABSTRACT Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) activity of platelets of an age- and sex-matched group of controls was compared with several groups of inpatients having non-familial dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT), Parkinson's disease (PD), multi-infarct dementia (MID), mixed types of these 3 diseases and a group of other central nervous system (CNS) organic disorders. All patients were subjected to several psychometric tests, including the Sandoz Clinical Assessment - Geriatric Scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Mini-Mental State Examination and the Organic Mental Disorder Scale (OMDS). A statistically significant enhancement of MAO-B activity could be observed in DAT patients and in PD patients, whereas the MID group showed a mean activity similar to that of the control group and the group with other organic CNS disorders. In DAT patients the degree of dementia in the OMDS test and the enhancement of MAO activity were positively correlated, but PD did not show such a correlation. It is concluded that the increase of MAO activity in PD and in DAT might be due to a disease-related enhanced affinity to oxygen and to such oxygen-derived radicals as superoxide or hydroxyl radicals. However, a possible drug-induced enhancement of MAO activity in PD cannot be excluded. Furthermore, the MAO-B activity values in platelets of individual patients or controls are not indicative of diagnosis or prognosis of any of these diseases and are of no disease-related specificity.

AB  - Abstract Objective: The purpose of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate peri-implant soft-tissue conditions and esthetic fulfillment during a 3-year follow-up period following prosthetic rehabilitation. Material and methods: As part of a prospective multi-center study, 152 ITI dental implants were placed in 80 patients in the maxillary anterior region. Fifty-nine crowns (38.82%) were cement retained, while 93 (61.18%) crowns were screw retained. At loading and 3, 6, 12 and 36 months post-loading, modified plaque index (MPI), sulcus bleeding index (SBI), keratinized mucosa (KM), gingival level (GL), and esthetic fulfillment were recorded. Results: All patients completed the study and no complications were reported. While statistically not significant at all time points, cement-retained crowns seemed to present a worsening trend in MPI and SBI scores. Interestingly, screw-retained crowns seemed to present an opposite picture, their MPI and SBI scores improved over time. While plaque accumulation, prophylaxis and depth of crown margin significantly affected levels of sulcus bleeding, prophylaxis alone played a key role in reducing plaque accumulation. No soft tissue recession was observed in either cement- or screw-retained crowns up to 3 years post-loading. Esthetic fulfillment survey revealed that patients did not have a preference for crown types; however, dentists favored cement-retained over screw-retained crowns. Conclusions: Peri-implant soft tissues responded more favorably to screw-retained crowns when compared with cement-retained crowns. However, no soft-tissue recession was observed in either type of crowns. Cement-retained crowns were preferred by dentists, while patients were equally satisfied with either type of crowns they received.

AB  - Abstract We have previously reported neuroprotection in spinal cord injury (SCI) by Lipitor [atorvastatin (AT)]-pre-treatment. Though informative, pre-treatment studies find only limited clinical application as trauma occurrence is unpredictable. Therefore, this study investigates the efficacy of AT treatment post-SCI. In a rat model of contusion-SCI resulting in complete hindlimb paralysis, AT treatment (5?mg/kg; gavage) was begun 2, 4, or 6?h post-SCI followed by a once daily dose thereafter for 6?weeks. While the placebo vehicle (VHC)-SCI rats showed substantial functional deficit, AT-SCI animals exhibited significant functional recovery. AT diminished injury-induced blood?spinal cord barrier (BSCB) dysfunction with significantly reduced infiltration and tumor necrosis factor-α/interleukin-1?/inducible nitric oxide synthase expression at site of injury. BSCB protection in AT-SCI was attributable to attenuated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) expression ? a central player in BSCB disruption. Furthermore, endothelial MMP9 expression was found to be RhoA/ROCK pathway-mediated and regulated by AT through an isoprenoid-dependent mechanism. Attenuation of these early inflammatory events reduced secondary damage. Significant reduction in axonal degeneration, myelin degradation, gliosis, and neuronal apoptosis with resultant enhancement in tissue sparing was observed in AT-SCI compared with VHC-SCI. In summary, this novel report presenting the efficacy of post-injury AT treatment might be of critical therapeutic value as effective treatments are currently unavailable for SCI.

Thirty-two rabbits were applied in three groups: A, controls; B, myotomy of the right femur; and C, myotomy and fracture of the right femur. Blood was sampled for the estimation of endotoxins [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)], tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, malondialdehyde (MDA) and isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs, derived after centrifugation over Ficoll, were incubated in flasks and apoptosis of non-adherent lymphocytes and adherent monocytes was estimated after staining for Annexin-V and flow cytometry. TNF-α of supernatants of cultured monocytes was also determined. Tissue segments were cultured after death. Median survival of groups A, B and C was?>?14,?>?14 and 9·00?days, respectively. Apoptosis of lymphocytes in group C was higher than group A at 2, 4 and 48 h and of monocytes in group C higher than group A at 2 and 4 hours. LPS in group C was higher than group A at 2, 4 and 48?h. Apoptosis of lymphocytes and monocytes was correlated positively with serum TNF-α and negatively with TNF-α of monocyte supernatants. Cultures of organ segments of group A were sterile. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from liver, lung and spleen in five animals in group B (45·45%) and in six in group C (54·54%). Early apoptosis of blood monocytes supervened after multiple trauma; the phenomenon was accompanied by apoptosis of blood lymphocytes and subsequent bacterial translocation.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing the study The microbiota plays a key role in health and disease. Probiotics are a potential way to therapeutically modify the intestinal microbiota and prevent disease. Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of probiotics on the bacterial microbiota of foals during and after administration. Study design Randomised placebo controlled field trial. Methods Thirty-eight healthy neonatal foals enrolled in a previous study were selected. The foals had received a multi-strain probiotic (four Lactobacillus spp. 3?4 ? 103 colony-forming units (cfu)/g each, Bifidobacterium animalis spp. lactis, 1 ? 103?4 cfu/g) or placebo once daily for 3 weeks. A total of 3 faecal samples were collected from each foal at 2-week intervals and assessed via metagenomic sequencing. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare data between treatment groups. Results There were no changes on the phylum, order or class level between treatment groups at any age (all P>0.05) but some significant changes in relative abundance of families. Probiotic administration did not result in an increased relative abundance of lactobacilli or bifidobacteria at any age (Lactobacillus: P = 0.9, P = 0.1 and P = 0.2, Bifidobacterium: P = 0.3, P = 0.6 and P = 0.1 for Weeks 2, 4 and 6, respectively). Lactobacillus was enriched in the probiotic group at Week 6 on LEfSe analysis (linear discriminant analysis score 0.34, P = 0 .02). There was no effect on alpha diversity (all P>0.2) or community structure when parsimony and unifrac analysis were applied (all P>0.6). Conclusions There were limited effects of probiotic treatment on the bacterial microbiota of foals. The studied probiotic based on lactobacilli and bifidobacteria has a limited potential for therapeutic modification of the gastrointestinal microbiota.

AB  - In order to provide data in support of licensure applications for citrate-phosphate-dextrose (CPD) supplemented with adenine, a multi-institutional cooperative effort was organized to determine survivability of red blood cells subjected to prolonged liquid storage. Two manufacturers supplied plastic multiple bag blood storage containers prefilled with modified CPD (glucose 25% greater than the normal concentration) supplemented with adenine (17.0 to 17.3 mg per 63 ml of anticoagulant; 0.25 millimolar approximate final concentration when diluted with 450 ml of whole blood). Red blood cells from 32 units stored as whole blood for 35 days showed a mean survival of 80.53 + 6.44 per cent (1 SD). Both red blood cell and supernatant plasma biochemical characteristics were comparable to those reported for whole blood stored for 21 days in either acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD) or CPD. Red blood cells from 19 units stored as concentrates for 35 days (Hct 75.03 + 3.74%) had a mean survival of 71.38 + 10.3 per cent with considerable interdonor variation in survival and interlaboratory variation in some biochemical characteristics. Red blood cells from eight units stored as concentrates (Hct 75.38 + 4.30%) for 28 days showed a mean survival of 83.97 + 6.10 per cent and biochemical characteristics comparable to those reported for red blood-cell concentrates stored in CPD or ACD for 21 days. Modified CPD with adenine as formulated offers an improved anticoagulant for blood banking by extending the permissible red blood cell storage period.

AB  - Abstract Osteoporosis frequently coexists with other chronic diseases and syndromes of aging, and therefore multimorbidity interactions can potentially complicate its evaluation and treatment. This article reviews osteoporosis comorbidity interactions with select common diseases of aging including cardiovascular, neurologic, and geriatric syndromes, and select commonly used medications by older adults. Using depression as a case example, we describe the complex relationship between osteoporosis, mood, and antidepressant medications, and the implications of these interactions for patients and clinicians.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to evaluate bone healing in calvarial defects using two bone graft substitute materials; biphasic beta-tricalcium phosphate/hydroxyapatite in hydrogel (ß-TCP/HA) versus composite non-demineralized xenogenic dentin with ß-TCP/HA mixture. Full thickness critical-sized defects were created bilaterally in 10 New Zealand male rabbits. Seven defects were left empty, six filled with biphasic tricalcium phosphate putty, and seven were filled with composite non-demineralized xenogenic dentin with biphasic tricalcium phosphate. Animals were sacrificed at eight weeks postoperatively and the healing of the biomaterial-filled defects was compared radiographically and by histomorphometry. Micro-computed tomography (?CT) was utilized to analyze the osteogenesis and healing patterns of the defects. Quantitative analysis of volume fraction (%) of the newly formed bone and remaining graft material (FV=filling volume/TV=tissue volume) and mean intensity [HU] in the defects were evaluated. Defects filled with composite dentin with biphasic tri-calcium phosphate showed volume fraction (FV/TV) in the order of 55.81% ± 17.72%, whereas defects filled with only biphasic tricalcium phosphate showed a fraction of 39.84% ± 16.06%, which represent the ratio of remaining graft material and new bone formation to the tissue volume. The empty negative control defects showed a volume fraction of 19.14% ± 8.787%. Histological analysis showed significant percentage increase in bone formation and residual graft with the composite Dentin/ß-TCP group after 8 weeks. The findings suggest that composite xenogenic dentin with biphasic tricalcium phosphate showed improved osteogenesis when compared to biphasic tricalcium phosphate without the addition of non-demineralized dentin. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The existence of interactions between sequential enzymes of metabolic pathways has been explored extensively throughout the field of biochemistry. These closely coupled pathways, termed metabolons, have been demonstrated to induce substrate channeling that results in increased efficiency by enhancing local substrate concentrations, protecting liable intermediates, and limiting distance between enzyme active sites. This phenomenon may have direct implication in the advancement of multi-enzyme enzymatic biofuel cells through the use of super-complex formations as bioanode catalysts. This will result in an efficient means of a more complete oxidation of a fuel, while optimizing the flux of the system through the recreation of a phenomenon that is conserved throughout biology.

AB  - Abstract We have previously shown that treatment with a mGluR5 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) is neuroprotective after experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI), limiting post-traumatic neuroinflammation by reducing pro-inflammatory microglial activation and promoting anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective responses. However, the specific molecular mechanisms governing this anti-inflammatory shift in microglia remain unknown. Here we show that the mGluR5 PAM, VU0360172 (VuPAM), regulates microglial inflammatory responses through activation of Akt, resulting in the inhibition of GSK-3?. GSK-3? regulates the phosphorylation of CREB, thereby controlling the expression of inflammation-related genes and microglial plasticity. The anti-inflammatory action of VuPAM in microglia is reversed by inhibiting Akt/GSK-3?/CREB signaling. Using a well-characterized TBI model and CX3CR1gfp/+ mice to visualize microglia in vivo, we demonstrate that VuPAM enhances Akt/GSK-3?/CREB signaling in the injured cortex, as well as anti-inflammatory microglial markers. Furthermore, in situ analysis revealed that GFP + microglia in the cortex of VuPAM-treated TBI mice co-express pCREB and the anti-inflammatory microglial phenotype marker YM1. Taken together, our data show that VuPAM decreases pro-inflammatory microglial activation by modulating Akt/GSK-3?/CREB signaling. These findings serve to clarify the potential neuroprotective mechanisms of mGluR5 PAM treatment after TBI, and suggest novel therapeutic targets for post-traumatic neuroinflammation.

AB  - Abstract Despite the many journal articles and reviews that have been published regarding the treatment of trauma to teeth, the endodontic management of these injuries is often still not fully understood. The purpose of this review is to establish clear and up-to-date guidelines for practitioners who are faced with treating dental injuries on a day-to-day basis, based on an assessment of current available scientific information relating to the endodontic management of these injuries. Treatment is discussed under the headings: infractions, uncomplicated crown fractures, complicated crown fractures, crown-root fractures, root fractures, luxation injuries, avulsion, root resorption, pulp canal obliteration and open-apex teeth. Emphasis is placed on the treatment of traumatized immature teeth where maintenance of pulp blood supply is important to encourage continued development of the root system. Only the treatment of traumatized permanent anterior teeth is reviewed. Information contained in this article is based on a review of the literature on dental trauma which involved a MEDLINE search using the key words ?dental trauma? and the individual topics listed above. The guidelines produced by the International Association of Dental Traumatology, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry and the American Association of Endodontists were also reviewed and the recommendations contained in this paper are in concert with the major recommendations of these bodies.

AB  - It has been hypothesized that increased flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is required to support the metabolic demands of rapid malignant cell growth. Using orthotopic mouse models of human glioblastoma (GBM) and renal cell carcinoma metastatic to brain, we estimated the activity of the PPP relative to glycolysis by infusing [1,2-13C2]glucose. The [3-13C]lactate/[2,3-13C2]lactate ratio was similar for both the GBM and brain metastasis and their respective surrounding brains (GBM, 0.197?±?0.011 and 0.195?±?0.033, respectively (p?=?1); metastasis: 0.126 and 0.119?±?0.033, respectively). This suggests that the rate of glycolysis is significantly greater than the PPP flux in these tumors, and that the PPP flux into the lactate pool is similar in both tumors. Remarkably, 13C?13C coupling was observed in molecules derived from Krebs cycle intermediates in both tumor types, denoting glucose oxidation. In the renal cell carcinoma, in contrast with GBM, 13C multiplets of ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) differed from its precursor glutamate, suggesting that GABA did not derive from a common glutamate precursor pool. In addition, the orthotopic renal tumor, the patient's primary renal mass and brain metastasis were all strongly immunopositive for the 67-kDa isoform of glutamate decarboxylase, as were 84% of tumors on a renal cell carcinoma tissue microarray of the same histology, suggesting that GABA synthesis is cell autonomous in at least a subset of renal cell carcinomas. Taken together, these data demonstrate that 13C-labeled glucose can be used in orthotopic mouse models to study tumor metabolism in vivo and to ascertain new metabolic targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy.
