AB  - Abstract Tissue approximation and repair are conventionally performed with sutures and staples, but these means are inherently traumatic. Tissue approximation using laser-responsive nanomaterials can lead to rapid tissue sealing and repair, and is an attractive alternative to existing clinical methods. Here, the use of laser-activated nanosealants (LANS) with gold nanorods (GNRs) embedded in silk fibroin polypeptide matrices is demonstrated. The adaptability of LANS for sealing soft tissues is demonstrated using two different modalities: insoluble thin films for internal, intestinal tissue repair, and semisoluble pastes for external repair, shown by skin repair in live mice. Laser repaired intestinal tissue held over seven times more fluid pressure than sutured intestine and also prevented bacterial leakage. Skin incisions in mice closed using LANS' showed indication of increased mechanical strength and faster repair compared to suturing. Laser-activated silk-GNR nanosealants rapidly seal soft-tissue tears and show high promise for tissue approximation and repair in trauma and routine surgery.

AB  - ABSTRACT Targeted bacterial delivery of anticancer proteins has the ability to overcome therapeutic resistance in tumors that limits the efficacy of chemotherapeutics. The ability of bacteria to specifically target tumors allows for delivery of aggressive proteins that directly kill cancer cells and cannot be administered systemically. However, few proteins have been tested for this purpose. To identify effective molecules, we systematically sorted proteins that have been shown to cause mammalian cell death. The genes for five proteins were selected and cloned into Escherichia coli and Salmonella. Supernatant from cultures of the transformed bacteria was applied to flasks of MCF-7 mammary carcinoma cells to identify proteins that (1) were expressed, (2) secreted, and (3) rapidly killed cancer cells. Time-lapse images were taken to visualize mammalian cell morphology. Of the investigated proteins, α-hemolysin from Staphylococcus aureus (SAH) was the most promising because it was secreted, caused trauma to cellular membranes, and induced oncosis in 18?min. After exposure for 6?h, SAH decreased cell viability by 90%. In comparison, the positive control, Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (PEA), required 11 days to achieve a similar effect, when administered at 3,000 times its LC50. The maximum death rate induced by SAH was calculated to be a reduction in cell viability of 7.1% per min, which was 200-fold faster than the PEA control. Two proteins, Dermonecrotic Toxin and Phospholipase C were active when extracted from the bacterial cytoplasm but were not secreted. This investigation revealed for the first time SAH as a potent anticancer drug for delivery by bacteria because of its ability to be secreted in a fully functional form and aggressively kill cancer cells.

AB  - . The Japanese Red Cross analysed the results of questionnaires sent in 1993 regarding post-transfusion graft-vs.-host disease (PT-GVHD) from hospitals; the majority of patients with PT-GVHD in 1993 were transfused for cardiovascular or cancer surgery, and about 10 patients had died yearly from PT-GVHD in the following few years. The Japan Society of Blood Transfusion (JSBT) organized a subcommittee for the prevention of PT-GVHD, and issued a fourth version of guidelines for the irradiation of blood to prevent PT-GVHD. These guidelines recommended transfusion of irradiated blood for cardiosurgery, cancer surgery, elderly recipients and severe trauma, as well as congenital immunodeficient recipients, newborn infants and other immunocompromised patients. Also recommended was irradiation not only of blood within 72?h after collection but also of blood stored for 14?days. Reported PT-GVHD has diminished to a few cases in recent years.

AB  - Abstract The objectives of this study were to evaluate temporal changes in lubricin, hyaluronan (HA), and HA molecular weight (MW) distributions in three distinct models of equine joint injury affecting the carpal (wrist), tarsal (ankle), and femoropatellar (knee) joints. To establish ranges for lubricin, HA, and HA MW distributions across multiple joints, we first evaluated clinically healthy, high-motion equine joints. Synovial fluid was collected from high-motion joints in horses without clinical signs of joint disease (n?=?11 horses, 102 joints) and from research horses undergoing carpal osteochondral fragmentation (n?=?8), talar cartilage impact injury (n?=?7), and femoral trochlear ridge full-thickness cartilage injury (n?=?22) prior to and following arthroscopically induced joint injury. Lubricin and HA concentrations were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and gel electrophoresis was performed to evaluate HA MW distributions. Synovial fluid parameters were analyzed via linear regression models, revealing that lubricin and HA concentrations were conserved across healthy, high-motion joints. Lubricin concentrations increased post-injury in all osteoarthritis models (carpal fragmentation P?=?.001; talar impact P?<?.001; femoral trochlear ridge cartilage defect P?=?.03). Sustained loss of HA was noted post-arthroscopy following carpal osteochondral fragmentation (P?<?.0001) and talar impact injury (P?<?.001). Lubricin may be elevated to compensate for the loss of HA and to protect cartilage post-injury. Further investigation into the mechanisms regulating lubricin and HA following joint injury and their effects on joint homeostasis is warranted, including whether lubricin has value as a biomarker for post-traumatic osteoarthritis.

AB  - Abstract Cell death occurs by one of two mechanisms: apoptosis (programmed cell death) or necrosis due to cellular injury or trauma. Each method has distinct morphological and biochemical characteristics. Distinguishing between apoptosis and necrosis depends selection of appropriate assays and proper timing. This unit provides an extensive series of assays that measure membrane integrity, cell size and DNA content, state of chromatin, DNA fragmentation, and caspase activation. The results of these assays allow one to distinguish between apoptosis and necrosis.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the use of ProcalAmine as a source of parenteral nutrition in hospitalized dogs and to report complications possibly referable to its use. Design Retrospective study. Settings Private veterinary teaching hospital. Animals Thirty-six dogs hospitalized in ICU receiving ProcalAmine between October 2010 and March 2013. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results The most common underlying disease process in this population of dogs was trauma (n = 8). Median duration of administration was 4 days and median resting energy requirement provided via ProcalAmine was 33%. ProcalAmine was administered via central catheters in 86% of cases and via peripheral catheters in 14% of cases. The overall mechanical complication rate was 19%. Metabolic complications possibly associated with ProcalAmine administration were documented in 12/36 dogs. Hyponatremia was most commonly identified (n = 6) followed by hyperglycemia (n = 4), hypochloremia (n = 2), azotemia (n = 2), metabolic alkalosis (n = 2), hyperchloremia (n = 1), and metabolic acidosis (n = 1). Conclusion ProcalAmine appears to be relatively safe and a viable option for parenteral nutrition in ill and injured dogs. Due to the potential for electrolyte derangements and other metabolic complications, daily monitoring of these parameters is advisable.

AB  - Abstract Aim To evaluate the influence of the luting system on the pull-out bond strength of conventionally and adhesively luted fiber-reinforced composite posts (FRCPs). Material and methods One hundred extracted bovine teeth (Di 3) were endodontically treated and randomly assigned to nine test groups and one control group (n = 10) according to luting system. After preparing the post cavities (8 mm), the custom-made FRCPs were inserted using conventional glass-ionomer cement (Ketac Cem), resin-reinforced glass-ionomer cement (Meron Plus and Fuji Plus), self-adhesive resin cement (RelyX Unicem and BisCem), self-conditioning adhesive and resin cement [Multilink Primer + Multilink and AdheSE + DC Activator + MultiCore Flow, or etch-and-rinse adhesive and resin cement (SealBond Ultima + CoreCem, and LuxaBond + LuxaCore Z). As a control, custom-made titanium posts were inserted with Ketac Cem. After water storage (37°C, 24 h, dark), the pull-out test was performed, followed by failure mode evaluation. The data were statistically analyzed (α = 0.05) using analysis of variance and the Dunnett T3 post hoc test. Results Luting system type and identity significantly influenced bond strength (P < 0.001); the bond strengths of all luting systems except Ketac Cem, MeronPlus, and BisCem were significantly higher than the control (4.4 ± 1.1 MPa). RelyX Unicem (12.0 ± 3.0 MPa) and LB + LCZ (14.8 ± 2.3 MPa) generated the highest bond strengths. The clinical application was demonstrated by restoring a traumatized tooth with extensive coronal destruction and thin root canal walls, using a FRCP combined with direct composite build-up. Conclusion Luting system selection significantly influenced the bond strength of conventionally and adhesively luted FRCPs to bovine root canal dentin.

AB  - Alcohol abuse causes impairment of cognitive function ranging from mild forms to end-stage dementia. Alcohol-related dementia accounts for nearly 20% of all admissions to state mental hospitals and may result from head trauma, thiamine deficiency, Alzheimer's, and other brain diseases that can be diagnosed conclusively only at autopsy. However, we postulate that after all these conditions have been excluded, an ?alcohol encephalopathy? remains. This is characterized by impaired synaptic function, which underlies the continuum of impaired intellectual function. We found in 79 histologically normal brains of a nondemented general hospital population a 40% decrease in the density of cholinergic muscarinic receptors in the frontal cortex of alcoholics when compared with matched controls of the same age. Only alcohol abuse and not aging, postmortem changes, medications, clinical (including liver) diseases, or differences in causes of death could account for this loss.

AB  - Summary Dental fluorosis is a developmental disturbance of the enamel layer of the tooth characterised by hypomineralised subsurface enamel caused by exposure to high levels of fluoride during tooth development and presents clinically as enamel opacities. The mechanism of fluorosis has been related to alteration of the enamel mineralisation process caused by a delay in the removal of amelogenins at the early-maturation stage of enamel formation. Two of the most widely used fluorosis indices are Dean's index and Thylstrup and Fejerskov index (TFI). The differential diagnosis for dental fluorosis includes mild forms of amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), early decalcified carious lesions, molar-incisor hypomineralisation (MIH), other environmental enamel defects and localised enamel hypoplasia due to trauma or infection of the primary teeth. Tooth bleaching, microabrasion, macroabrasion, conservative adhesive direct composite restorations or indirect porcelain veneers are commonly used for management of enamel opacities, depending on the severity of the defects.

AB  - SUMMARY The sequence of events leading to the formation of a psoriatic plaque induced by tape-stripping was studied using light and electron microscopy. Among the earliest changes noted were increased mobility of the epidermal Langerhans cells across the basement membrane, evidence of Langerhans cell-lymphocyte interaction, and increased Langerhans cell ?activity? or ?cytotoxicity?. These changes were seen as early as 2 min after stripping and remained until the development of clinical psoriasis. Collections of epidermal lymphocytes showing the features of blastoid transformation while in contact with processes from activated Langerhans cells, suggest the involvement of la antigens in this process. We postulate that these findings are a manifestation of an increased immune responsiveness to trauma, controlled by genes located at the HLA-D locus of the major histocompatibility complex, and mediated by enhanced cellular interactions. The appearance of basal keratinocyte herniations (BKH) at 1?3 weeks after stripping, coincided with the development of clinical psoriasis. Neutrophils made their appearance at the same time as, or slightly before, the appearance of BKH, and are suspected to play a role in the development of these structures. We believe that BKH maintain epidermal proliferation through the persistence of the epidermal-stromal interaction.

AB  - Summary One hundred and seventeen patients admitted to an intensive care unit were studied, to determine whether there is any relationship between laboratory data taken on admission to the unit and the final outcome (survival or non-survival) of the stay within the intensive care unit. Discriminant analysis of the data shows that patients could be allocated to one of two groups (survival or non-survival) using the two parameters of age and serum phosphate, and that this allocation proves correct in 70% of cases, irrespective of the admitting disease and treatment. The validity of this discriminant function was tested in a further 53 cases and the allocation of patients to survival or non-survival groups was found to be correct in 70% of cases, supporting the first estimate of the discriminant function.

AB  - Abstract In diabetes, the number of bone mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) decreases and their differentiation is impaired. However, the exact mechanism is unclear. Patients with diabetes often experience sympathetic nerve injury. Norepinephrine (NE), a major mediator of the sympathetic nervous system, influences rat MSC migration in culture and in vivo. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of NE on MSCs under high glucose conditions; therefore MSCs were treated with high glucose and NE. High glucose-induced MSCs apoptosis, which was reversed by NE. To verify the effect of NE, mice underwent sympathectomy and were used to establish a diabetic model. Diabetic mice with sympathectomy had a higher apoptosis rate and higher levels of reactive oxygen species in their bone marrow-derived cells than diabetic mice without sympathectomy. High glucose inhibited p-AKT production and B-Cell CLL/Lymphoma 2 expression, and promoted BAX and caspase-3 expression. NE reversed these effects of high glucose. An AKT inhibitor enhanced the effects of high glucose. Thus, NE had a protective effect on MSC apoptosis induced by high glucose, possibly via the AKT/BCL-2 pathway.

AB  - Summary Orthobiologics have emerged as new treatment options in human and animal athletes. Musculoskeletal disorders such as tendinopathies, desmopathies, and osteoarthritis are common in competition and working dogs because of stresses induced by their repetitive activities. Several therapies, such as anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, shockwave therapy, and surgery have been used to treat these disorders, but variable levels of evidence and success have been reported. Tendon and ligament healing potential is limited, especially in chronic injuries, which are commonly seen in athletes. Therefore, novel regenerative treatment approaches are of great interest in sports medicine. There are two goals of this chapter. First, the definitions and proposed mechanisms of action for different orthobiologics are reviewed; second, the clinical applications and the evidence for efficacy of these novel treatments are discussed. The chapter focuses on two major topics. Platelet-rich plasma is reviewed in detail, as this is the most commonly used orthobiologic in veterinary medicine. Stem cell applications are also presented, focusing on musculoskeletal and spinal injuries. The chapter is not intended to provide a thorough review of the literature on these topics, but aims to introduce the sports medicine and rehabilitation therapist to the growing area of regenerative medicine.

AB  - Abstract Mammalian hibernation consists of periods of depressed metabolism and reduced body temperature called ?torpor? that are interspersed by normothermic arousal periods. Numerous cellular processes are halted during torpor, including transcription, translation, and ion homeostasis. Hibernators are able to survive long periods of low blood flow and body temperature followed by rewarming and reperfusion without overt signs of organ injury, which makes these animals excellent models for application of natural protective mechanisms to human medicine. This review examines efforts to induce torpor-like states in non-hibernating species using pharmacological compounds. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms of natural and pharmacologically induced torpor will speed the development of new clinical approaches to treat a variety of trauma and stress states in humans.

AB  - Abstract Cystic fibrosis patients and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, trauma, burn wound, or patients requiring ventilation are susceptible to severe pulmonary infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Physiological innate defense mechanisms against this pathogen, and their alterations in lung diseases, are for the most part unknown. We now demonstrate a role for the sphingoid long chain base, sphingosine, in determining susceptibility to lung infection by P. aeruginosa. Tracheal and bronchial sphingosine levels were significantly reduced in tissues from cystic fibrosis patients and from cystic fibrosis mouse models due to reduced activity of acid ceramidase, which generates sphingosine from ceramide. Inhalation of mice with sphingosine, with a sphingosine analog, FTY720, or with acid ceramidase rescued susceptible mice from infection. Our data suggest that luminal sphingosine in tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells prevents pulmonary P. aeruginosa infection in normal individuals, paving the way for novel therapeutic paradigms based on inhalation of acid ceramidase or of sphingoid long chain bases in lung infection.
