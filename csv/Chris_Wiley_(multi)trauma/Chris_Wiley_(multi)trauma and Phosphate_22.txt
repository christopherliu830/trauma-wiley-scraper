AB  - Abstract This study compared the bone forming capacity of the same formulation of silicate-substituted bone graft substitute materials with different microporosity in an instrumented posterolateral spinal fusion ovine model. Materials with a strut porosity of (i) 22.5% (SiCaP) or (ii) 36.0% (SiCaP(+)) were packed along either side of the spine. Bone apposition rates, % new bone formation, % bone-implant contact, and % graft resorption were quantified at 8, 12, and 24 weeks post surgery. Computed Tomography (CT) was used to grade the formation of fusion bridges between vertebrae. Results showed no significant difference in bone apposition rates, % new bone formation, and % bone-implant contact when the two materials were compared. However, at 8 weeks, a significantly higher CT score was obtained in the SiCaP(+) group (0.83?±?0.17) when compared with the SiCaP group (0.17?±?0.17; p?=?0.027). Significantly less scaffold remained in the SiCaP(+) group at 12 weeks (p?=?0.018). Both SiCaP and SiCaP(+) formulations augmented bone formation. Increasing the strut porosity did not significantly increase bone formation however, at 8 weeks it promoted the formation of more highly mineralized bone resulting in a significantly higher CT score, suggesting the bone tissue formed was more mature. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis Gene therapy offers the possibility of delivering corrective genetic materials to the cochlea, potentially improving hearing. In animals, the most commonly used surgical methods for viral gene therapy delivery to the cochlea are the round window and the cochleostomy approaches. However, the patterns of viral infection and the effects on hearing have not been directly compared between these two approaches. In this study, we compare the patterns of cochlear infection and effects on hearing between these two surgical approaches using adeno-associated virus serotype 2/8 (AAV8) as the gene delivery vehicle. Study Design Animal study and basic science research. Methods One- to two-month-old CBA/J mice were used in this study. AAV8-green fluorescent protein (GFP) was delivered to the cochlea by either the round window or the cochleostomy approach (described below). Auditory brainstem response was used to examine hearing thresholds before and after surgery. Animals were examined at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after surgery for the patterns of cochlear infection and hearing loss. Results Cochlear gene transfer was successful through both surgical approaches. In both approaches, AAV8-GFP mostly infected the inner hair cells. There was occasional low-level infection of the outer hair cells and supporting cells. The two surgical approaches resulted in comparable viral infection efficiencies. The round window approach resulted in less surgical trauma, as indicated by hearing loss, than the cochleostomy approach. Conclusions Adeno-associated virus-mediated gene transfer to the cochlea can be accomplished using either the round window or the cochleostomy surgical approach. The round window approach resulted in less hearing loss compared to the cochleostomy approach. Level of Evidence NA Laryngoscope, 125:2557?2564, 2015

AB  - 1. Renal blood flow autoregulation was studied in anaesthetized greyhounds, using an electromagnetic flowmeter, before and after the administration of the prostaglandin-synthesis inhibitor, indomethacin, or phosphate buffer. 2. Indomethacin caused a reduction in renal blood flow at all levels of perfusion pressure, but did not affect the ability of the kidney to autoregulate. 3. The aburpt reinstatement of renal perfusion pressure from previously reduced levels caused a triphasic transient response in flow. Peak hyperaemia at the beginning of the transient was not affected by indomethacin. After indomethacin, the second phase of this flow transient showed an oscillatory pattern during which flow fell initially to levels significantly lower than control. 4. It is concluded that although indomethacin did not abolish steady-state autoregulation, renal prostaglandins may damp rapid oscillations in renal blood flow and thus contribute to the efficiency of autoregulation.

AB  - Neuropathic pain?pain resulting from a lesion, damage, or dysfunction of the somatosensory nervous system?can arise through several distinct etiologies ranging from toxicity, surgery, radiation, and trauma to congenital disorders. Neuropathic pain is widely recognized as a common consequence of cancer and results from administration of several common oncology drugs. It not only impacts quality of life, but it also impacts patient outcomes because of resulting treatment delays, dose reductions, and discontinuations. We estimate that the cost of the problem in the U.S. alone is approximately $2.3 billion. Despite its widely recognized importance, there is a paucity of reliable information available regarding the incidence, prevalence of patient-and physician-reported severity, and time course of cancer-related neuropathic pain. To address this severe knowledge gap, we need new, high-quality, population-based studies of individual cancer pain syndromes and conditions. However, in order to gather this information, we also need substantial improvements in the specific classification of cancer-related neuropathic syndromes and better validated diagnostic tools that can help to elucidate the incidence, prevalence, severity, and potential economic impact of cancer-associated neuropathies.

AB  - ABSTRACT Bone is one of the most transplanted tissues. While most bone defects heal spontaneously, critical size defects caused by major trauma/malignant tumor and osteonecrosis of femoral head in young adults pose a great challenge in treatment. While the golden standard in treating bone defects is autologous bone grafting, available bone for grafting is quite limited in an individual. To solve the dilemma, stem cell therapy has been tried as a new modality of treatment in lesions not amenable to autologous bone grafting. While successful results were reported from individual studies, the stem cell therapy is still not an established treatment modality for bone regeneration and needs further assessment. Our focus herein is to introduce stem cell sources that have been investigated so far and review the current status of stem cell reutilization for bone regeneration as well as suggesting future perspectives.

AB  - Abstract Acrolein, a major lipid peroxidation product, has been associated with both CNS trauma and neurodegenerative diseases. Because of its long half-life, acrolein is a potent endogenous toxin capable of killing healthy cells during the secondary injury process. Traditionally, attempts to intervene in the process of progressive cell death after the primary injury have included scavenging reactive oxygen species (so-called free radicals). The animal data supporting such an approach have generally been positive, but all human clinical trials attempting a similar outcome in human CNS injury have failed. New drugs that might reduce toxicity by scavenging the products of lipid peroxidation present a promising, and little investigated, therapeutic approach. Hydralazine, a well-known treatment for hypertension, has been reported to react with acrolein, forming hydrazone in cell-free systems. In the companion paper, we have established an acrolein-mediated cell injury model using PC12 cells in vitro. Here we test the hypothesis that the formation of hydrazone adducts with acrolein is able to reduce acrolein toxicity and spare a significant percentage of the population of PC12 cells from death. Concentrations of approximately 1 mM of this aldehyde scavenger can rescue over 80% of the population of PC12 cells. This study provides a basis for a new pharmacological treatment to reduce the effects of secondary injury in the damaged and/or diseased nervous system. In particular, we describe the need for new drugs that possess aldehyde scavenging properties but do not interfere with the regulation of blood pressure. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Bleeding complications arising from trauma, surgery, and as congenital, disease-associated, or drug-induced blood disorders can cause significant morbidities and mortalities in civilian and military populations. Therefore, stoppage of bleeding (hemostasis) is of paramount clinical significance in prophylactic, surgical, and emergency scenarios. For externally accessible injuries, a variety of natural and synthetic biomaterials have undergone robust research, leading to hemostatic technologies including glues, bandages, tamponades, tourniquets, dressings, and procoagulant powders. In contrast, treatment of internal noncompressible hemorrhage still heavily depends on transfusion of whole blood or blood's hemostatic components (platelets, fibrinogen, and coagulation factors). Transfusion of platelets poses significant challenges of limited availability, high cost, contamination risks, short shelf-life, low portability, performance variability, and immunological side effects, while use of fibrinogen or coagulation factors provides only partial mechanisms for hemostasis. With such considerations, significant interdisciplinary research endeavors have been focused on developing materials and technologies that can be manufactured conveniently, sterilized to minimize contamination and enhance shelf-life, and administered intravenously to mimic, leverage, and amplify physiological hemostatic mechanisms. Here, a comprehensive review regarding the various topical, intracavitary, and intravenous hemostatic technologies in terms of materials, mechanisms, and state-of-art is provided, and challenges and opportunities to help advancement of the field are discussed.

AB  - Abstract ?Decoy? oligonucleotides can be used as gene-specific nuclear factor (NF-?B) inhibitors to regulate gene expression. We applied two different decoy oligonucleotides that contained the NF-?B binding consensus sequences present in the immunoglobulin G (IgG)-?B and Bcl-x promoter into 7-day-old (P7) rat lateral ventricles before hypoxia/ischemia (HI) and compared their effects on gene expression in hippocampi to saline-treated, scrambled decoy-treated, or untreated hippocampi exposed to HI. Left hippocampi were collected at 12 hr after HI. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) showed that the two decoy treatments had different effects on NF-?B binding to the IgG-?B and Bcl-x promoter-specific consensus sequences, respectively. We assessed the decoys' effects on gene expression 12 hr after HI using ribonuclease protection assays (RPAs) and Affymetrix DNA microarrays. RPAs showed that both decoys significantly decreased interleukin (IL)-1α mRNA levels but had no impact on IL-1?, IL-6, and IL-10 mRNA levels. IgG-?B decoys significantly decreased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and TNF-? mRNA levels compared to minimal changes after treatment with Bcl-x decoys. DNA microarray analyses showed that Bcl-x decoy treatment significantly decreased Bcl-xL mRNA levels. The decreased Bcl-xL mRNA levels after Bcl-x decoy treatment was confirmed by RPA analysis. DNA microarray data also indicated that several other genes were affected by both decoys. Our results suggest that different NF-?B decoy treatments could differentially regulate transcriptional responses to central nervous system trauma. Careful design of decoy sequences, however, is essential to acquire selective effects on cell death outcome. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

We explore this question through a consideration of what the expected nature of any such evidence might be, based on general and specific historical accounts and an understanding of site formation processes. Although limited success has been achieved to date in locating definitive evidence for such sites in Australia, we conclude that there are some specific situations where archaeology could usefully be applied to give rise to a more multi-dimensional understanding of the past.

Anthropometric measurements in patients did not differ from non-hospitalised controls. The routine use of multi-channel biochemical analysis to estimate plasma albumin, and the estimation of haemoglobin levels are of value in the postoperative management of surgical patients. Consideration of early intravenous feeding should be given to those patients who do not make a rapid recovery from major surgery.

AB  - Abstract Despite a number of clinically available hemostats, uncontrolled bleeding is the primary cause of trauma-related death. Shape-memory polymer (SMP) foams have a number of desirable properties for use as hemostats, including shape recovery to enable delivery into bleed sites, biocompatibility, and rapid blood clotting. To expand upon this material system, the current work aims to incorporate phenolic acids, which are honey-based antimicrobial agents, into SMP foams. We showed that cinnamic acid (CA) can be utilized as a monomer in SMP synthesis to provide foams with comparable pore structure and retained cytocompatibility. The addition of CA enabled tuning of thermal and shape-memory properties within clinically relevant ranges. Furthermore, the modified foams demonstrated initial and sustained antimicrobial effects against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. These multifunctional scaffolds demonstrate potential for use as hemostats to improve upon current hemorrhage treatments and provide a new tool in tuning the biological and material properties of SMP foams.

A relative surface content of 3.7% sulfur, which demonstrated heparin immobilization on the polycarbonate substrate, was observed on x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and a initial bioactivity of approximately 88.5 ± 7.3 mIU/cm2 was obtained by the chromogenic method for antifactor Xa assay. Furthermore, in vitro observation of platelet and fibrin adherence using bovine blood under dynamic flow conditions for 6 h revealed that the multi-ionically heparinized Gyro C1E3 had significantly stronger antithrombogenecity than the noncoated original type which was evaluated as a good hemocompatible blood pump for clinical use. Not only the Gyro C1E3 but also the ionically heparin-coated Gyro pump are expected to be thromboresistant in clinical use.

AB  - Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that impairs memory and other cognitive functions in the elderly. The social and financial impacts of AD are overwhelming and are escalating exponentially as a result of population aging. Therefore, identifying AD-related risk factors and the development of more efficacious therapeutic approaches are critical to cure this neurological disorder. Current epidemiological evidence indicates that life experiences, including chronic stress, are a risk for AD. However, it is unknown if short-term stress, lasting for hours, influences the onset or progression of AD. Here, we determined the effect of short-term, multi-modal ?modern life-like? stress on AD pathogenesis and synaptic plasticity in mice bearing three AD mutations (the 3xTg-AD mouse model). We found that combined emotional and physical stress lasting 5 h severely impaired memory in wild-type mice and tended to impact it in already low-performing 3xTg-AD mice. This stress reduced the number of synapse-bearing dendritic spines in 3xTg-AD mice and increased A? levels by augmenting A?PP processing. Thus, short-term stress simulating modern-life conditions may exacerbate cognitive deficits in preclinical AD by accelerating amyloid pathology and reducing synapse numbers.

AB  - Chronic osteomyelitis associated with soft-tissue defect following surgical management is a severe complication for orthopaedic surgeons. Traditionally, the treatment protocol for the notorious complication involved thorough debridement, bone grafting, long-term antibiotic use and flap surgery. Alternatively, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), a high concentration of platelets collected via centrifugation, has been successfully used as an adjuvant treatment for bone and soft-tissue infection in medical practices. PRP has numerous significant advantages, including stypsis, inflammation remission and reducing the amount of infected fluid. It increases bone and soft-tissue healing and allows fewer opportunities for transplant rejection. Through many years of studies showing the advantages of PRP, it has become preferred organic product for the clinical treatment of infections, especially for chronic osteomyelitis associated with soft-tissue defect. To promote the clinical use of this simple and efficacious technique in trauma, we report the case of a patient with chronic calcaneal osteomyelitis associated with soft-tissue defect that healed uneventfully with PRP.

AB  - Mucinous metaplasia occurs uncommonly in cutaneous pathology, usually at specialized anatomic locations (genitalia, palms, soles) and within restricted pathologic contexts (inflammation, trauma). Here we report a unique case of eccrine mucinous metaplasia associated with an apocrine cystadenoma. A 13-year-old girl had an asymptomatic, 4-mm nodule on the chest. Histopathology demonstrated a typical apocrine cystadenoma in the upper and middle dermis. Adjacent to this neoplasm was a cluster of coiled eccrine secretory ducts, of which the inner layer was almost entirely replaced by benign-appearing cells containing abundant, non-sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides. At eight months? follow-up, there was no recurrence. Our case demonstrates that, very uncommonly, mucinous metaplasia may be associated with a pathogenetically separate, adjacent neoplasm, in this instance an apocrine cystadenoma.
