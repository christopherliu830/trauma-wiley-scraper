AB  - Mucinous metaplasia occurs uncommonly in cutaneous pathology, usually at specialized anatomic locations (genitalia, palms, soles) and within restricted pathologic contexts (inflammation, trauma). Here we report a unique case of eccrine mucinous metaplasia associated with an apocrine cystadenoma. A 13-year-old girl had an asymptomatic, 4-mm nodule on the chest. Histopathology demonstrated a typical apocrine cystadenoma in the upper and middle dermis. Adjacent to this neoplasm was a cluster of coiled eccrine secretory ducts, of which the inner layer was almost entirely replaced by benign-appearing cells containing abundant, non-sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides. At eight months? follow-up, there was no recurrence. Our case demonstrates that, very uncommonly, mucinous metaplasia may be associated with a pathogenetically separate, adjacent neoplasm, in this instance an apocrine cystadenoma.

AB  - Objective:? Bone involvement in chronic renal failure is manifested long before the initiation of dialysis and is more prevalent in patients receiving inadequate conservative phase management. This study aimed at identifying the extent of renal bone disease among pre-dialysis and maintenance dialysis patients. Method: Thirty-two patients (gr 1) on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) for variable period of time were compared to twenty newly detected, irregularly treated, (gr 2) pre-dialysis severe renal failure patients for their clinical, biochemical, and imaging features. Result:?Mean age of gr 1 and gr 2 patients was 45?±?14 vs. 34?±?15 years (p?<?0.05). Comparison of blood biochemistry between group 1 and 2 showed serum creatinine 9.9?±?2.9 vs. 13.4?±?4.4?mg/dl (P?<?0.01), calcium 10?±?1.4 vs. 7.4?±?1?mg/dl (p?<?0.001); phosphate 4.4?±?1 vs. 8?±?2?mg/dl (p?<?0.008); ionized calcium 4.7?±?0.1 vs. 3.9?±?0.7?mg/dl (p?<?0.05); alkaline phosphatase 116?±?31 vs. 86?±?31?IU/l (p?<?0.05); and iPTH 72?±?48 vs. 147?±?92?pg/ml (p?<?0.05). Radiological changes present in the two groups were osteopenia-63% vs. 65%(P?=?NS); trabecular resorption-53% vs. 20%(p?<?0.05); soft tissue calcification-31% vs. 10%(p?<?0.05); bone cyst-16% vs. 25%(P?=?NS) and subperiosteal bone resorption-16% vs. 20%(P?=?NS). Tc 99MDP bone scan combined in both groups of patients (n?=?52) showed increased uptake in wrist joint (29%), tibia-fibula (25%), costochondral junction, vertebral column (15% each), sternum (13%), radius and ulna (10%), and calvaria and mandible (8% each). X-ray finding was positive for bone involvement in 59% cases and Tc 99 scan was positive in 80%(p?<?0.05). Association study showed iPTH had a negative correlation with serum calcium (r?=??0.5, p?<?0.05) and a positive correlation with serum phosphate (r?=?0.7, p?<?0.05) and alkaline phosphatase (r?=?0.9, p?<?0.001). Conclusion:?It is concluded that pre-dialysis newly detected renal failure patients may present with deranged calcium homeostasis and can manifest high prevalence of bone involvement when compared to maintenance hemo-dialysis patients.

AB  - ABSTRACT The dental cementum covering the tooth root is similar to bone in several respects but remains poorly understood in terms of development and differentiation of cementoblasts, as well as the potential function(s) of cementocytes residing in the cellular cementum. It is not known if the cementocyte is a dynamic actor in cementum metabolism, comparable to the osteocyte in the bone. Cementocytes exhibit irregular spacing and lacunar shape, with fewer canalicular connections compared with osteocytes. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR (qPCR) revealed that the in vivo expression profile of cementocytes paralleled that of osteocytes, including expression of dentin matrix protein 1 (Dmp1/DMP1), Sost/sclerostin, E11/gp38/podoplanin, Tnfrsf11b (osteoprotegerin [OPG]), and Tnfsf11 (receptor activator of NF-?B ligand [RANKL]). We used the Immortomouse+/?; Dmp1-GFP+/? mice to isolate cementocytes as Dmp1-expressing cells followed by immortalization using the interferon (IFN)-?-inducible promoter driving expression of a thermolabile large T antigen to create the first immortalized line of cementocytes, IDG-CM6. This cell line reproduced the expression profile of cementocytes observed in vivo, including alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization. IDG-CM6 cells expressed higher levels of Tnfrsf11b and lower levels of Tnfsf11 compared with IDG-SW3 osteocytes, and under fluid flow shear stress, IDG-CM6 cells significantly increased OPG while decreasing RANKL, leading to a significantly increased OPG/RANKL ratio, which would inhibit osteoclast activation. These studies indicate similarities yet potentially important differences in the function of cementocytes compared with osteocytes and support cementocytes as mechanically responsive cells. ? 2015 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

The dog in question, a 6-year-old Welsh springer spaniel, was presented with flaccid tail and faecal and urinary incontinence. The histological lesions included severe mononuclear cell infiltration of the nerve roots of the cauda equina and of the lumbar nerve roots. The infiltrate was composed of large numbers of T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes and small numbers of macrophages. Polymerase chain reactions of brain and spinal tissues were positive for Neospora caninum.

AB  - Abstract Normal ageing and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have many features in common and, in many respects, both conditions only differ by quantitative criteria. A variety of genetic, medical and environmental factors modulate the ageing-related processes leading the brain into the devastation of AD. In accordance with the concept that AD is a metabolic disease, these risk factors deteriorate the homeostasis of the Ca2+?energy?redox triangle and disrupt the cerebral reserve capacity under metabolic stress. The major genetic risk factors (APP and presenilin mutations, Down's syndrome, apolipoprotein E4) are associated with a compromise of the homeostatic triangle. The pathophysiological processes leading to this vulnerability remain elusive at present, while mitochondrial mutations can be plausibly integrated into the metabolic scenario. The metabolic leitmotif is particularly evident with medical risk factors which are associated with an impaired cerebral perfusion, such as cerebrovascular diseases including stroke, cardiovascular diseases, hypo- and hypertension. Traumatic brain injury represents another example due to the persistent metabolic stress following the acute event. Thyroid diseases have detrimental sequela for cerebral metabolism as well. Furthermore, major depression and presumably chronic stress endanger susceptible brain areas mediated by a host of hormonal imbalances, particularly the HPA-axis dysregulation. Sociocultural and lifestyle factors like education, physical activity, diet and smoking may also modulate the individual risk affecting both reserve capacity and vulnerability. The pathophysiological relevance of trace metals, including aluminum and iron, is highly controversial; at any rate, they may adversely affect cellular defences, antioxidant competence in particular. The relative contribution of these factors, however, is as individual as the pattern of the factors. In familial AD, the genetic factors clearly drive the sequence of events. A strong interaction of fat metabolism and apoE polymorphism is suggested by intercultural epidemiological findings. In cultures, less plagued by the ?blessings? of the ?cafeteria diet?sedentary? Western lifestyle, apoE4 appears to be not a risk factor for AD. This intriguing evidence suggests that, analogous to cardiovascular diseases, apoE4 requires a hyperlipidaemic lifestyle to manifest as AD risk factor. Overall, the etiology of AD is a key paradigm for a gene-environment interaction. Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

With evolving surgical approaches for organ retrieval and implantation, it has become standard to procure the pancreas in conjunction with other abdominal organs without compromising either vasculature, graft quality, or transplant outcomes. This review summarizes the major steps required for proper whole-organ retrieval of the pancreas allograft with suggestions and tips whenever alternative approaches are available.

AB  - Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is a rare neurological disorder. Mutations in five genes (SLC20A2, PDGFRB, PDGFB, XPR1, and MYORG) have been linked to PFBC. Here, we used SYBR green-based real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography analysis to detect copy number variants (CNVs) in 20 unrelated patients with PFBC, negatively sequenced for the five known genes. We identified three deletions in SLC20A2, including a large de novo full gene deletion and two exonic deletions confined to exon 2 and exon 6, respectively. Subsequent linked-read whole-genome sequencing of the patient with the large deletion showed a 1.7 Mb heterozygous deletion which removed the entire coding regions of SLC20A2 as well as 21 other genes. In the family with a deletion of exon 6, a missense variant of uncertain significance (SLC20A2: p.E267Q) also co-segregated with the disease. Functional assay showed the deletion could result in significantly impaired phosphate transport, whereas the p.E267Q variant did not. Our results confirm that deletion in SLC20A2 is a causal mechanism for PFBC and highlight the importance of functional study for classifying a rare missense variant as (likely) pathogenic.

AB  - The Aksys PHD system is designed for short quotidian dialysis employing a 52-liter batch of ultrapure dialysate and up to 30 in situ hot water reuses of the entire extracorporeal circuit including a 40-liter physical cleaning before each dialysis. Methods:?We studied the effect of the 52-liter tank during 108 long 5?8 hour dialysis 3.5?6 times/week in 5 patients and one 50-liter patient simulator for 4 weeks. Phosphate (PO4), beta-2 microglobulin (b-2), urea (BUN), and creatinine (creat) were measured pre-, during, and post-dialysis 86 times and in total dialysate 74 times during long dialysis. Tank saturation, Kt/V, and monthly chemistries were also measured. Results:? Patient weight 76?±?2?kg, QB 234?±?23?ml/min, QD 498?±?13?ml/min. Dialysate was recirculated 4.8 times during 8 hours. Analyte Short Long dialysis p Pre-BUN ???70?±?18 ???49?±?15 <0.0001 Pre-creat ???12?±?3 ???10?±?2 <0.0002 Pre-PO4 ?5.2?±?1.5 ?4.1?±?1.1 <0.003 Pre-b-2 34.0?±?5.3 27.8?±?4.5 <0.0001 All patients on 8?hrs???5 dialyses/week stopped phosphate binders within 3 weeks. eKt/V(urea) rose to 0.5 in one hour and then slowly to 0.8 at 8 hours. Weekly stdKt/V: Dialyses/week/Hrs: 2 5 8 5 2.2 2.7 3.0 6 2.7 3.4 3.6 7 3.1 3.8 4.4 At 8?hrs the tank was 99?±?8% saturated with BUN, 86?±?12% with creat, 77?±?18% with PO4, and only 12?±?5% with b-2. Total removal per dialysis increased 2 gm BUN, 0.4?gm?creat, 0.4?gm PO4, and 40?mg?b-2. The decline per reuse in conductivity clearance was only 0.7?±?1.2% during short and 1.4?±?1.4% during long dialysis (p?=?0.11). There was no change in monthly chemistries or hematologies. Discussion:? The data show that the Aksys PHD is very effective for long 8-hour dialysis. The data for PO4 and b-2 are the same as reported for conventional dialysis machines using 5 times as much dialysate, and the weekly stdKt/V if the PHD is used every night is twice the standard defined by K/DOQI. The exceptional cleanliness and biocompatibility by way of the one-per-month reuse should be a great advantage to patients. The full automatization saves the patient one hour every night and 30 minutes every morning. The PHD also economizes on filters and dialysate and is good for the environment.

AB  - Abstract Hypoxic?ischemia injury occurs after trauma causes consequential bone necrosis. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently used in orthopedic clinics for pain relief. However, the underlying mechanism and outcome for usage of NSAIDs is poorly understood. To investigate the damage and loss of osteoblast function in hypoxia, two hypoxia mimetics, cobalt chloride (CoCl2) and desferrioxamine (DFO), were used to create an in vitro hypoxic microenvironment. The cell damage was observed by decreases of cell viability and increases in cyclooxygenase-2 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Cell apoptosis was confirmed by WST-1 cytotoxic assays and flow cytometry. The functional expression of osteoblast in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was significantly decreased by CoCl2 and inhibited when treated with DFO. To simulate the use of NSAID after hypoxic injury, four types of anti-inflammatory drugs, sulindac sulfide (SUL), indomethacin (IND), aspirin (Asp), and sodium salicylate (NaS), were applied to osteoblasts after 1?h of hypoxia mimetic treatment. SUL and IND further enhanced cell death after hypoxia. ALP activity was totally abolished in hypoxic osteoblasts under IND treatment. Facilitation of osteoblast apoptosis occurred regardless of IND dosage under hypoxic conditions. To investigate osteoblast in vivo, local hypoxia was created by fracture of tibia and then treated the injured mice with IND by oral feeding. IND-induced osteoblast apoptosis was confirmed by positive staining of TUNEL assay in fractured mice. Significant delay of fracture healing in bone tissue was also observed with the treatment of IND. These results provide information pertaining to choosing appropriate anti-inflammatory drugs for orthopedic patients. J. Cell. Biochem. 113: 148?155, 2012. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Orthodontic forces, the prescription for correcting malocclusions, are considered to have a multi-potential nature. Research has also shed light on the elevated levels of signaling molecules in the gingival crevicular fluid of moving teeth, both useful and harmful to the human body. The main effects, which are categorized as periodontal destruction following orthodontic mechanics, are loss of attachment and bone loss. External apical root resorption (EARR) entails a permanent shortening of dental roots, and formation of large lacunae that erode the roots laterally. Lacerations or irritations to oral mucosal tissues are a common clinical observation in the orthodontic office. Allergy or sensitivity reactions may occur with alloying components such as nickel, chromium and cobalt, which are often incorporated in orthodontic attachments and archwires.

AB  - Abstract Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient required for the activity of metalloenzymes. It is an essential component of parenteral nutrition (PN), but requirements are low. Mn status is difficult to assess, with the commonest method being measurement of its concentration in whole blood. This method has limitations, including artifactually high concentrations resulting from contamination of specimen tubes. Mn toxicity is a well-recognized complication of PN, the risk of which increases if there is cholestasis or if the patient has received high doses. It usually presents with parkinsonian-like symptoms but may be detected presymptomatically as hypermanganesemia or as increased signal intensity of the basal ganglia upon T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Caution is necessary when providing Mn for patients on long-term PN (>1 month). It is advisable to withhold supplementation if hypermanganesemia or cholestasis develops. Deficiency of Mn is rare in patients treated with PN. PN regimens are contaminated with Mn in amounts likely to meet requirements. Consequently, it is debated whether PN should be routinely supplemented with Mn. The currently recommended dose of Mn in adults treated with PN is 55 ?g/d, but the doses provided by most currently available multi?trace element products exceed this. In response to calls for new products to be developed, 2 new multi?trace element products are currently available in Europe that provide Mn doses of 55 ?g/d. Once these products are in general use, it is likely that the incidence of Mn toxicity will decrease.

AB  - ABSTRACT Diabetic ketoacidosis is a common medical emergency and may represent up to 14% of all diabetic admissions with an annual incidence of about 4.6 cases per 1,000 diabetics per year. A spectrum of disease is encountered and mortality rates vary in different series from 1.9% to 15%. The pathogenesis of diabetic ketoacidosis is discussed in detail with particular emphasis on interpretation of biochemistry results and on fluid and electrolyte resuscitation. A flexible approach to fluid resuscitation, careful interpretation of biochemistry results, and close monitoring should be combined with other standard aspects of management such as titratable insulin infusions and early treatment of identifiable precipitants in order to minimise morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Summary Careful assessment of the biochemistry panel and familiarity with normal biochemistry values for neonatal foals is imperative in the workup of any critically ill neonate, particularly those with neurological signs. The importance of rapidity of change compared to the absolute value of the biochemical abnormality must be emphasised. Serial biochemical panels ideally assist in assessing rapidity of change. Many foals can have severe biochemical derangements in the absence of seizures. Identifying values that are significantly out of range should spur immediate therapy to correct them and potentially additional diagnostic testing to determine the cause of the abnormalities. A temporal relationship between correction of biochemical abnormalities and resolution of seizures and encephalopathic signs supports causation.

AB  - Abstract In this study, a ceramic-coated nanofibrous scaffold has been fabricated to biomimic the microstructure of natural extracellular matrix and the stiffening inorganic compartment of bone. Poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) nanofibers were electrospun and exposed to oxygen plasma to induce hydrophilicity and promote ceramic adsorption. Hardystonite (HS), which possesses superior osteoinduction potential over hydroxyapatite, was coated on plasma-treated PLLA nanofibers by drenching the nanofibers in HS suspension. Pure and composite PLLA-based scaffolds were characterized in terms of physical and biological properties. In vitro cultivation of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) on the scaffolds displayed that the composite scaffold is able to further support cell attachment and proliferation. In case of osteogenic differentiation of AMSCs, HS coating significantly increased the synthesis and activity of alkaline phosphate over 21 days period. In addition, the composite scaffold showed improved mineralization. The expression level of osteonectin and osteocalcin genes was significantly enhanced by HS coating of nanofibers. The biological improvement of PLLA nanofibrous matrix in the presence of HS nanoparticles could either be attributed to the release and stimulatory effect of constituent ions of HS or to the modification of chemico-physical properties of the resultant ceramic by silicon and zinc present in HS.

AB  - Ticks are ectoparasites that cause dermatologic disease both directly through physical trauma to the skin, salivary secretions, or remnant body parts, and indirectly through transmission of disease. Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, and babesiosis are known tick-transmitted diseases. The histopathology related to a primary tick bite, similar to other arthropod bites, classically consists of a perivascular infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils, histiocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils in varying amounts. We describe five patients with a novel histologic reaction to embedded tick parts., Each case demonstrates a thrombotic vasculopathy consisting of intraluminal eosinophilic deposits that stain strongly with Periodic acid Schiff stain. The adjacent tissue shows dermal necrosis with surrounding interstitial to diffuse dermal neutrophilic inflammation. We postulate that diffuse dermal nutrophilic infiltrates in association with thrombogenic vasculopathy is an unusual histologic picture of tick bite reactions that may be attributable to remnant tick parts.

AB  - Abstract Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is correlated with angiogenesis and early relapse of colorectal cancer (CRC). This study investigated the role of miR-148a in the regulation of VEGF/angiogenesis and early relapse of CRC. We established a stable clone with miR-148a expression in HCT116 and HT29 cell lines and created a hypoxic condition by using CoCl2 to determine the underlying mechanism of miR-148a. The effects of miR-148a on the phosphoryl-ERK (pERK)/hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)/VEGF pathway were evaluated through Western blotting and the inhibitory effect of miR-148a on angiogenesis was demonstrated through a tube formation assay. Sixty-three CRC tissues (28 early relapse and 35 non-early relapse) were analysed to assess the relationship between miR-148a and HIF-1α/VEGF. The protein expression of pERK/HIF-1α/VEGF in HCT116 and HT29 cells was significantly decreased by miR-148a (all P < 0.05). The protein expression of VEGF/HIF-1α was strongly inversely associated with the expression of miR-148a in the 63 CRC tissue samples (all P < 0.05). Tube formation assay demonstrated that miR-148a significantly obliterated angiogenesis. miR-148a suppresses VEGF through down-regulation of the pERK/HIF-1α/VEGF pathway and might lead to the inhibition of angiogenesis; miR-148a down-regulation increased the early relapse rate of CRC. This demonstrates that miR-148a is a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target.

AB  - ABSTRACT In the present study, an attempt has been made to improve cell supportive property of chitosan/nano beta tri-calcium phosphate (?-TCP) composite scaffolds by modification of scaffold surface with fibrin using ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodimide (EDC) as crosslinking agent. The developed fibrin conjugated chitosan/nano ?-TCP composite scaffolds possess desired pore size and porosity in the range of 45?151 µm and 81.4?±?4.1%, respectively. No significant change in compressive strength of scaffolds was observed before and after fibrin conjugation. The calculated compressive strength of fibrin conjugated and non-conjugated chitosan/nano ?-TCP scaffolds are 2.71?±?0.14 MPa and 2.67?±?0.11 MPa, respectively. Results of cell culture study have further shown an enhanced cell attachment, cell number, proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization on fibrin conjugated chitosan/nano ?-TCP scaffold. The uniform cell distribution over the scaffold surface and cell infiltration into the scaffold pores were assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Furthermore, higher expression of osteogenic specific genes such as bone sialo protein, osteonectin, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin (OC) on fibrin conjugated scaffolds was observed when compared to scaffolds without fibrin. Altogether, results indicate the potentiality of developed fibrin conjugated composite scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.
