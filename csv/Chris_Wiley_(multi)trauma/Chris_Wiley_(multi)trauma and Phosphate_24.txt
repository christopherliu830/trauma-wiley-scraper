AB  - Summary Myriads of wound-care products are on the market, and making the right choice for a specific wound can be complex, especially because the scientific literature on wound-care products in horses is sparse. To select the best possible dressing, the veterinarian must decide which material is needed to enhance healing. The clinician must then determine if antimicrobial therapy is required. Several antibacterial compounds are available for topical use and are often more effective than systemically administered antibiotics in the management of severe contamination, critical colonization, or infection. To serve the requirements of specific wounds, several combinations of antimicrobial drugs and dressings are available. The wound milieu changes as healing progresses and so do the requirements for dressings. Continued assessment, based on a thorough clinical examination and sound knowledge of the healing process, is indicated, therefore, to maintain an optimal environment for healing.

AB  - Summary Bone metastases can be classified into osteolytic, osteoblastic/sclerotic, or mixed phenotypes. Imaging plays a vital role in the detection, evaluation, and monitoring of osseous metastatic disease. Plain radiographs can be used to assess the alignment of bone/vertebrae, the presence of fractures, and?by measuring cortical thickness?the risk for fracture. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a method of measuring bone mineral density that is in widespread use for osteoporosis detection. Radionuclide bone scintigraphy (RBS) demonstrates areas of active bone remodeling through the phosphate groups in the administered radiotracers binding to hydroxyapatite in the bone matrix. Micro-SPECT (?SPECT) is a preclinical version of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) that is used in animals. Due to high sensitivity, only tiny amounts of radiotracer are needed, and multiple tracers can be used to image several molecular events simultaneously.

The regeneration of oral and craniofacial tissues presents a formidable challenge that requires synthesis of basic science, clinical science, and engineering technology. Tissue engineering is an interdisciplinary field of study that addresses this challenge by applying the principles of engineering to biology and medicine toward the development of biological substitutes that restore, maintain, and improve normal function. This review will explore the impact of biomaterials design, stem cell biology and gene therapy on craniofacial tissue engineering.

The honey samples highest antioxidant capacity was from Multi floral from Greece and the lowest for Mono floral black locust from Romania. The pollen from Romania presented higher antioxidant capacity compared with the pollen from Portugal but both pollen samples have a greater antioxidant capacity compared with the honey samples. In the presence of honey and pollen the DNA oxidative damage, induced by hydroxyl radicals generated through the Fenton reaction, was decreased.

AB  - Abstract Hybridization of nanoscale metals and carbon nanotubes into composite nanomaterials has produced some of the best-performing sensors to date. The challenge remains to develop scalable nanofabrication methods that are amenable to the development of sensors with broad sensing ranges. A scalable nanostructured biosensor based on multilayered graphene petal nanosheets (MGPNs), Pt nanoparticles, and a biorecognition element (glucose oxidase) is presented. The combination of zero-dimensional nanoparticles on a two-dimensional support that is arrayed in the third dimension creates a sensor platform with exceptional characteristics. The versatility of the biosensor platform is demonstrated by altering biosensor performance (i.e., sensitivity, detection limit, and linear sensing range) through changing the size, density, and morphology of electrodeposited Pt nanoparticles on the MGPNs. This work enables a robust sensor design that demonstrates exceptional performance with enhanced glucose sensitivity (0.3 µM detection limit, 0.01?50 mM linear sensing range), a long stable shelf-life (>1 month), and a high selectivity over electroactive, interfering species commonly found in human serum samples.

AB  - Comparison of the University of California (Los Angeles) shoulder scale and the simple shulder test with shoulder pain and disability index: Single-administration reliability and validity. (Texas Woman's University, Houston, TX) Phys Ther. 2000;80:759?768. This study compared 2 shoulder measures?the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) Shoulder Scale and the Simple Shoulder Test (SST)?with the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). One hundred ninety-two patients with shoulder disorders were recruited from one physician's office to complete the self-report sections of the 3 scales. Cronbach alpha values and standard errors of measurements (SEM) were calculated for each of the multi-item subscales. Validity was examined through calculation of correlation coefficients among the 3 scales. Factor analysis was completed to assess the underlying constructs of the SPADI and SST. Cronbach alpha values ranged from 0.85 to 0.95. The SEM values for the multi-item scales ranged from 4.75 to 11.65. Evidence for validity to reflect function was indicated by the correlation between the SST and the SPADI disability subscale. The factor analysis of the SPADI revealed loading on 1 factor, whereas the SST loaded on 2 factors. Conclude that all scales demonstrated good internal consistency, suggesting that all items for each scale measure the same constract. However, SEMS for all scales were high. Factor loading was consistent, suggesting that patients may not distinguish between pain and function. Comment by Philip S. Sizer Jr., MED, PT. Clinical practitioners are leaning toward evaluating functional status versus a pure-impairment-based approach to appraising shoulder limitations. Several scales have been developed for the evaluation of shoulder function, including the University of California Los Angeles Shoulder Scale (UCLA), the Simple Shoulder Test (SST), and the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). Investigations demonstrating the psychometric properties of these scales are limited in number. These investigators attempted to assess those properties, including internal consistency, reliability, and validity for all 3 scales. The analyses demonstrated internal consistency and construct homogeneity for the SPADI. However, all 3 scales demonstrated rather large standard errors of measure, which questions the reliability of the scales for measurement of an individual's progress. Regarding construct validity, the SPADI does not appear to distinguish between pain and dysfunction, disqualifying its use as a gold standard for comparison with other scales. While the SST purports to measure a single construct, the data suggests that it appears to measure 2 different constructs namely function and comfort. Additionally, the analyses appear to demonstrate that, while the scales may attempt to measure the same constructs, they apparently do not. Finally, the authors suggest that the precision of the UCLA scale is inferior to the other 2 scales and insufficient for following the progress of individual patients in the clinical setting.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: It is presently unknown whether cartilage ischaemia plays any part in the pathogenesis of osteochondral fragmentation within the equine metatarsophalangeal joint, as no detailed studies on microcirculation in the area have been reported. Objective: To describe the developmental pattern of the blood supply to the epiphyseal growth cartilage in the metatarso-phalangeal joint of foals. Methods: Eight Standardbred foals were sacrificed between birth and age 7 weeks to undergo a barium perfusion procedure to demonstrate vessels within growth cartilage canals of one hindlimb. The metatarso-phalangeal joint was cleared in methyl salicylate and perfused vessels studied in the intact bones. The bones were sawed into 5 mm thick slabs, decalcified and radiographed. Selected slabs were cleared in methyl salicylate for a second time and examined at low magnification. The dorsal half of the sagittal ridge of the distal third metatarsal bone and the plantar half of the proximal phalanx were examined histologically. Results: Regions of the epiphysis with thick cartilage contained a greater number of perfused vessels than regions with thin cartilage. The cartilage canal vessels were oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the underlying ossification front. Cartilage canal vessels were incorporated into the ossification front during growth and became reliant on a subchondral arterial source. Macroscopically visible lesions were not detected in the current group of foals. On histological examination, pathological changes consisting of an area of chondronecrosis surrounded by fibrovascular granulation tissue were found in sections from the lateral proximo-plantar eminence of the proximal phalanx in the 7-week-old foal. Conclusion: The same anatomical feature (traversing the ossification front to enter cartilage canals) reported to render vessels vulnerable to failure in the tarsus was also present in the metatarso-phalangeal joint of foals. Potential relevance: Osteochondrosis may occur by the same pathogenetic mechanism in the metatarso-phalangeal joint as in the tarsus of foals.

AB  - Abstract Stem cell-based therapy may be the most promising method to cure skeletal muscle degenerative diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and trauma in the future. Human amniotic fluid is enriched with early-stage stem cells from developing fetuses and these cells have cardiomyogenic potential both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we investigated the characteristics of human amniotic fluid-derived AF-type stem (HAF-AFS) cells by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation analysis. After confirming the stemness of HAF-AFS cells, we tested whether HAF-AFS cells could differentiate into skeletal myogenic cells in vitro and incorporate into regenerating skeletal muscle in vivo. By temporary exposure to the DNA demethylation agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza dC) or co-cultured with C2C12 myoblasts, HAF-AFS cells differentiated into skeletal myogenic cells, expressing skeletal myogenic cell-specific markers such as Desmin, Troponin I (Tn I) and α-Actinin. Four weeks after transplantation into cardiotoxin-injured and X-ray-irradiated tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of NOD/SCID mice, HAF-AFS cells survived, differentiated into myogenic precursor cells and fused with host myofibres. The findings that HAF-AFS cells differentiate into myogenic cells in vitro and incorporate in skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo hold the promise of HAF-AFS cell-based therapy for skeletal muscle degenerative diseases.

AB  - Cochlear implants restore the inner ear hearing using electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. However, there is potential to improve the implant's function in terms of stimulation selectivity by increasing the number of electrode contacts. Meanwhile, the electrode stiffness shall not be elevated, because this would enhance insertion trauma and fibrous tissue encapsulation of the implant. Since the increase in the number of electrode contacts results in an increase of electrode stiffness, novel materials are needed for manufacturing electrode shafts. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as electrode contacts offer new perspectives concerning mechanical properties and electrode-nerve interfacing. However, by using CNTs immersed in liquid silicone rubber (LSR) as electrode material, the electrical conductivity of the bulk needs to be improved. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of using CNT?LSR as electrode material by increasing the conductivity of such materials and confirming their biocompatibility. First results show, that the electrode material can be printed in isolated layers, while the conductivity of the bulk can be improved. Fibroblasts growth tests indicated biocompatible properties of CNT?LSR samples. In conclusion CNT?LSR materials can be considered as promising candidates for use in neural implants possessing proper mechanical, electrical as well as biocompatible properties.

AB  - Abstract? Nitric oxide (NO) has emerged as a key mediator in the mechanisms of ischaemic tolerance induced by a wide variety of preconditioning stimuli. NO is involved in the brain protection that develops either early (minutes?hours) or late (days?weeks) after the preconditioning stimulus. However, the sources of NO and the mechanisms underlying the protective effects differ substantially. While in early preconditioning NO is produced by the endothelial and neuronal isoform of NO synthase, in delayed preconditioning NO is synthesized by the inducible or ?immunological? isoform of NO synthase. Furthermore, in early preconditioning, NO acts through the canonical cGMP pathway, possibly through protein kinase G and opening of mitochondrial KATP channels. In late preconditioning, the protection is mediated by peroxynitrite formed by the reaction of NO with superoxide derived from the enzyme NADPH oxidase. The mechanisms by which peroxynitrite exerts its protective effect may include improvement of post-ischaemic cerebrovascular function, leading to enhancement of blood flow to the ischaemic territory, and expression of prosurvival genes resulting in cytoprotection. The evidence suggests that NO can engage highly effective and multifunctional prosurvival pathways, which could be exploited for the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular pathologies.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Human dental pulp cells (HDPCs) with multi-potential differentiational capacity can undergo odontoblastic differentiation when stimulated with proinflammatory cytokines. However, factors linking proinflammatory stimuli and their odontoblastic differentiation have, as yet, not been completely understood. As an apoptotic transcription factor, DDIT3 plays a crucial role in the inflammatory reaction and in osteogenic differentiation. Thus, we hypothesized that DDIT3 may participate in odontoblastic differentiation of HDPCs. Materials and methods Immunofluorescent staining was used to detect expression of DDIT3 in HDPCs and effects of TNFα, on its nuclear accumulation. HDPCs that overexpressed DDIT3 were developed and their proliferation and odontoblastic differentiation abilities were examined. qRT-PCR was employed to detect mineralization-related genes, including ALP, runt-related transcription factor-2 (Runx2), osterix (OSX), dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1 (DMP1) and osteocalcin (OCN). Western blot analysis was performed to detect expression of DSPP protein. Results DDIT3 was expressed in HDPCs. TNFα treatment enhanced mRNA expression as well as nuclear accumulation of DDIT3 (slightly). DDIT3 overexpression reduced HDPC proliferation, however, it increased their calcium nodule formation and expression of OSX, DSPP, DMP1 and OCN. Conclusions DDIT3 may be a factor that links proinflammatory stimuli and differentiation of HDPCs.

Advancing age is a risk factor for acute kidney injury, and is associated with a higher mortality and reduced renal recovery. Standard diagnostic criteria may miss acute kidney injury in the older patient. Sodium disturbances may be multifactorial and the cause may be more difficult to determine in the older patient. Symptoms and signs are largely related to speed of onset. Hypercalcaemia requiring emergency treatment is most often due to malignancy.

AB  - Aims Urethral stricture (US) formation is caused by fibrosis after excessive collagen formation following an injury or trauma to the urethra. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on a urethral injury (UI) model of male rats. Methods A UI model was used by applying a coagulation current to the urethras of male rats. There were four groups with six rats in each: control group, PRP applied to naive urethra, UI group, and UI with PRP application. PRP was applied to the urethra after a coagulation current-induced injury as soon as possible. On the 14th day, all rats were sacrificed and urethral tissues were investigated for collagen type I, collagen type III, platelet-derived growth factor-α, platelet-derived growth factor-?, and transforming growth factor-? using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. The effect of urethral damage and healing was evaluated for collagen type I-to-collagen type III ratio. Results The collagen type I-to-collagen type III ratio was significantly higher in UI group (P?<?0.05) than in the others, while UI with PRP application group had comparable results with the control group (P?>?0.05). Conclusions The results of this study show that PRP has a preventive effect on stricture formation in a UI model of rats, as shown by its effect on collagen synthesis. Further studies that eventually show the effects of PRP on human tissues are necessary and promising.

AB  - Abstract Minimum intervention dentistry (MID) is the modern medical approach to the management of caries, utilizing caries risk assessment, and focusing on the early prevention and interception of disease. Moving the focus away from the restoration of teeth allows the dentist to achieve maximum intervention, with minimal invasive treatments. The four core principles of MID can be considered to be: (1) Recognition ? early identification and assessment of potential caries risk factors through lifestyle analysis, saliva testing and using plaque diagnostic tests; (2) Reduction ? to eliminate or minimize caries risk factors by altering diet and lifestyle habits and increasing the pH of the oral environment; (3) Regeneration ? to arrest and reverse incipient lesions, using appropriate topical agents including fluorides and casein phosphopeptides-amorphous calcium phosphates (CPP-ACP); (4) Repair ? when cavitation is present and surgical intervention is required, conservative caries removal is carried out to maximize the repair potential of the tooth and retain tooth structure. Bioactive materials are used to restore the tooth and promote internal healing of the dentine. Effective implementation of MID involves integrating each of these four elements into patient assessment and treatment planning. This review paper discusses the key principles of MID as a philosophy of patient care, and the practical objectives which flow into individual patient care.
