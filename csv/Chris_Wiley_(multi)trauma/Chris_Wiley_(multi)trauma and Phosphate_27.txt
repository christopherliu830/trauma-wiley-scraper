AB  - Abstract Bone repair after trauma or surgical intervention involves a tightly regulated cascade of events that starts with hemostasis and an inflammatory response, which are critical for successful healing. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are routinely prescribed for pain relief despite their potential inhibitory effect on bone repair. The goal of this study was to determine the impact of administration of the non-selective NSAID diclofenac in the inflammatory phase of bone repair in mice with or without lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic inflammation. Repair of femoral window defects was characterized using micro computed tomography imaging and histological analyses at 2 weeks postoperative. The data indicate (a) impaired bone regeneration associated with reduced osteoblast, osteoclast, and macrophage activity; (b) changes in the number, activity, and distribution of mast cells in regenerating bone; and (c) impaired angiogenesis due to a direct toxic effect of diclofenac on vascular endothelial cells. The results of this study provide strong evidence to support the conjecture that administration of NSAIDs in the first 2 weeks after orthopaedic surgery disrupts the healing cascade and exacerbates the negative effects of systemic inflammation on the repair process.

AB  - Plastic gloves are made of polymers including polyvinylchloride, polyvinylalcohol, polyethylene and polyvinylacetate. Additives such as plasticizers, stabilizers, UV light absorbers, fungicides, bactericides, flame retardants and colourants are added to the polymer, and these are potential allergens. Contact allergy to plastic gloves is rare. The allergen responsible for the sensitization usually remains unknown. An organic pigment, Irgalite Orange F2G, and bisphenol A have both caused contact allergy from household-type PVC gloves. 1 patient with allergic contact dermatitis from his PVC gloves reacted also to tricresyl phosphate and triphenyl phosphate, chemicals known to be used as plasticizers in PVC. A plasticizer, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DOP), caused 1 case of contact urticaria from the vinyl chloride slip guard of cotton gloves. 1 patient with contact urticaria from his polyethylene gloves reacted to 3 antioxidants, octadecanoic acid methyl ester and di-tertiary butyl phenol of the gloves on scratch testing. We report 3 additional cases of allergic contact dermatitis from PVC gloves due to bisphenol A. 2 of the patients reacted also to para-tertiary butyl catechol, a polymerization inhibitor in PVC. In chemical analysis, the connection between sensitization to para-tertiary butyl catechol and the use of vinyl gloves could not be proven. We analysed 16 brands of disposable PVC gloves for medical use, covering at least 80% of the Finnish market. We found a very small amount of bisphenol A in 1 brand, and no para-tertiary butyl catechol in any of the gloves. However, bisphenol A should be remembered as a possible allergen in PVC gloves.

AB  - Summary The parathyroid glands in dogs and cats are tan-colored ovoid structures closely associated with each thyroid gland. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) release is controlled by calcium receptors on the chief cells in the parathyroid glands in response to hypocalcemia. PTH has a short half-life (3?5 min) in serum and so a steady rate of secretion is necessary to maintain serum PTH concentrations. Natural variations in PTH concentration occur in healthy dogs. Exploratory surgery with parathyroidectomy in dogs with primary hyperparathyroidism serves as both a diagnostic test and definitive therapy. Surgery should be advocated to reduce the risk of urolithiasis and urinary tract infection, as well as improving the clinical signs seen with hypercalcemia such as polydipsia, polyuria, weakness, and decreased appetite. Surgical excision alone is the most widely performed treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism and a cure rate of 94% is reported if all autonomously functioning parathyroid tissue is removed.

AB  - Cell swelling activates or upregulates a number of anion channels. Of the volume-activated or -regulated anion channels (VAACs or VRACs), the volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying anion channel (VSOR) is most prominently activated and ubiquitously expressed. This channel is known to be involved in a variety of physiological processes including cell volume regulation, cell proliferation, differentiation and cell migration as well as cell turnover involving apoptosis. Recent studies have shown that VSOR activity is also involved in a number of pathophysiological processes including the acquisition of cisplatin resistance by cancer cells, ischaemia?reperfusion-induced death of cardiomyocytes and hippocampal neurons, glial necrosis under lactacidosis as well as neuronal necrosis under excitotoxicity. Moreover, VSOR serves as the pathway for glutamate release from astrocytes under ischaemic conditions and when stimulated by bradykinin, an initial mediator of inflammation. So far, many signalling molecules including the EGF receptor, PI3K, Src, PLC? and Rho/Rho kinase have been implicated in the regulation of VSOR activity. However, our pharmacological studies suggest that these signals are not essential components of the swelling-induced VSOR activation mechanism even though some of these signals may play permissive or modulatory roles. Molecular identification of VSOR is required to address the question of how cells sense volume expansion and activate VSOR.

AB  - Abstract In posterior spinal fusion, insufficient decortication may decrease the number of bone marrow derived ostoprogenitor stem cells and affect the success of bony fusion. The finding of bone formation through interaction between rhBMP-4 and non-marrow derived mesenchymal cells constituted the basis of the current study. The aim is to investigate the possibility of molecular enhancement of posterior spinal fusion by site-specific application of rhBMP-4 with or without surgical decortication. Eighteen adult rabbits underwent single level bilateral posterior intertransverse process spinal fusion at L5-L6, one side with decortication, and the other side without decortication. Two animals underwent sham operation without bone grafts, the other 16 animals were randomly allocated into three groups, using hydroxyapatite-tricalcium phosphate (HA-TCP) ceramic blocks augmented with 0, 0.125 and 0.5 mg of rhBMP-4 respectively. Spinal fusion morphology was evaluated with sequential X-ray, microradiography and histomorphology. At week 7, complete bony fusion was achieved in none of the groups without rhBMP-4 irrespective of whether the bony contact surface was decorticated or not. In the groups with low dose rhBMP-4, complete fusion occurred in two of six un-decorticated sites (33%) and in three of six (50%) decorticated sites. 100% complete fusion was found in the high dose rhBMP-4 group independent of surgical decortication. The dorsal cortices of the un-decorticated transverse processes were replaced by newly formed trabecular bone through biological remodeling. This study suggested that rhBMP-4 can induce non-marrow derived mesenchymal cells to differentiate into osteogenic cells and thus enhance the high success rate of posterior spinal fusion in both the decorticated and un-decorticated model. ? 2002 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Changes in protein subdomains through alternative splicing often modify protein-protein interactions, altering biological processes. A relevant example is that of the stress-induced up-regulation of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE-R) splice variant, a common response in various tissues. In germ cells of male transgenic TgR mice, AChE-R excess associates with reduced sperm differentiation and sperm counts. To explore the mechanism(s) by which AChE-R up-regulation affects spermatogenesis, we identified AChE-R's protein partners through a yeast two-hybrid screen. In meiotic spermatocytes from TgR mice, we detected AChE-R interaction with the scaffold protein RACK1 and elevated apoptosis. This correlated with reduced scavenging by RACK1 of the pro-apoptotic TAp73, an outcome compatible with the increased apoptosis. In contrast, at later stages in sperm development, AChE-R's interaction with the glycolytic enzyme enolase-α elevates enolase activity. In transfected cells, enforced AChE-R excess increased glucose uptake and adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) levels. Correspondingly, TgR sperm cells display elevated ATP levels, mitochondrial hyperactivity and increased motility. In human donors' sperm, we found direct association of sperm motility with AChE-R expression. Interchanging interactions with RACK1 and enolase-α may hence enable AChE-R to affect both sperm differentiation and function by participating in independent cellular pathways.

AB  - Abstract There are over 62 different biominerals on Earth and a diverse array of organisms that generate these biominerals for survival. This review will introduce the process of biomineralization and the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of mineral formation, and then comparatively explore the representative secretomes of two well-documented skeletal systems: vertebrate bone (calcium phosphate) and invertebrate mollusk shell (calcium carbonate). It is found that both skeletal secretomes have gross similarities and possess proteins that fall into four functional categories: matrix formers, nucleation assisters, communicators, and remodelers. In many cases the mineral-associated matrix former and nucleation assister sequences in both skeletal systems are unique and possess interactive conserved globular domains, intrinsic disorder, post-translational modifications, sequence redundancy, and amyloid-like aggregation-prone sequences. Together, these molecular features create a protein-based environment that facilitates mineral formation and organization and argue in favor of conserved features that evolve from the mollusk shell to bone. Interestingly, the mollusk shell secretome appears to be more complex compared to that of bone tissue, in that there are numerous protein subcategories that are required for the nucleation and organization of inner (nacre) and outer (prismatic) calcium carbonate regions of the shell. This may reflect the organizational and material requirements of an exoskeletal protective system.

AB  - Objectives? To characterize equine bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) growth characteristics and frequency as well as their adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential. Study Design? In vitro experimental study. Animals? Foals (n=3, age range, 17?51 days) and young horses (n=5, age range, 9 months to 5 years). Methods? Equine MSCs were harvested and isolated from sternal BM aspirates and grown up to passage 10 to determine cell-doubling (CD) characteristics. Limit dilution assays were performed on primary and passaged MSCs to determine the frequency of colony-forming units with a fibroblastic phenotype (CFU-F), and the frequency of MSC differentiation into adipocytes (CFU-Ad) and osteoblasts (CFU-Ob). Results? Initial MSC isolates had a lag phase with a significantly longer CD time (DT=4.9±1.6 days) compared with the average DT (1.4±0.22 days) of subsequent MSC passages. Approximately 1 in 4224±3265 of the total nucleated BM cells displayed fibroblast colony-forming activity. Primary MSCs differentiated in response to adipogenic and osteogenic inductive conditions and maintained their differentiation potential during subsequent passages. Conclusions? The frequency, in vitro growth rate, and adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential of foals and young adult horses are similar to those documented for BM MSCs of other mammalian species. Clinical Relevance? The results have direct relevance to the use of BM as a potential source of adult stem cells for tissue engineering applications in equine veterinary medicine.

Materials and Methods Retrospective, observational study of dogs and cats that were diagnosed with urinary tract infection caused by C. urealyticum. Results This report concerns a total of 11 dogs and 10 cats. All cats had a history of urethral catheterisation, and six cats had undergone urological surgery before diagnosis of this specific infection. Dogs had history of neurogenic urinary incontinence (n=5), urethral catheterisation (n=4), urological surgery (n=4), lower urinary tract disease (n=2) or prostatic disease (n=1). In seven animals, previous urine culture was negative. Median urine pH was 8.6 (interquartile range 7.5 to 9), and 19 animals had pyuria and struvite crystalluria. Encrusted cystitis was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound in nine animals. All but one isolate were resistant to at least three antimicrobial classes. Thirteen isolates were sensitive to tetracyclines. There was bacterial and clinical resolution of the infection in nine dogs and seven cats. Two animals died from sepsis and two cats were euthanased because of clinical deterioration. Clinical Significance Urinary tract infection caused by C. urealyticum should be suspected in animals with pre-existing urinary disorders, especially if urine is alkaline and there is struvite crystalluria, negative routine urine culture and encrusted cystitis.

AB  - The anti-proliferative effect of methylglyoxal bis(cyclopentyl-amidino-hydrazone) (MGBCP), a multi-enzyme inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, on the growth of Helicobacter pylori was investigated. MGBCP inhibited the cell growth of H. pylori in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibition was partially reversed by the addition of spermidine. Synthesis of macromolecules, DNA, RNA and protein, was inhibited in the spermidine-depleted H. pylori cells. These findings suggest that MGBCP exhibits an anti-proliferative effect on H. pylori by suppression of macromolecule synthesis.

AB  - Biomaterial approaches for engineering orthopedic interfaces such as the tendon-bone junction (TBJ) are limited by a lack of understanding of how insoluble (microstructure, composition) and soluble regulators of stem cell fate work in concert to promote bioactivity and differentiation. One strategy for regenerating the interface is to design biomaterials containing spatially graded structural properties sufficient to induce divergent mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation into multiple interface-specific phenotypes. This work explores the hypothesis that selective structural modification to a 3D collagen?glycosaminoglycan (CG) scaffold combined with biochemical supplementation can drive human bone-marrow-derived MSC differentiation down tenogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages. Tenogenic differentiation is enhanced in geometrically anisotropic scaffolds versus a standard isotropic control. Notably, blebbistatin treatment abrogates this microstructurally driven effect. Further, enhanced osteogenic differentiation and new mineral synthesis are achieved by incorporation of a calcium phosphate mineral phase within the CG scaffold along with the use of osteogenic induction media. Finally, chondrogenic differentiation is optimally driven by combining chondrogenic induction media with a reduced density scaffold that promotes increased cellular condensation, significantly higher expression of chondrogenic genes, and increased GAG deposition. Together these data provide critical insight regarding design rules for elements of an integrated biomaterial platform for orthopedic interface regeneration.

AB  - Abstract Objectives As mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be isolated easily from adipose tissues while retaining their self-renewal and multi-potential differentiation capacities, they hold promising possibilities for being applied extensively in tissue engineering. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family members have been reported to provide instructive signals to MSCs for them to differentiate into several different cell lineages. The study described here aims to investigate whether BMP-4 could promote adipose-derived stem cell (ASC) differentiation into adipocytes under various concentrations. Materials and methods ASCs were isolated from mouse inguinal adipose pads and cultured in vitro. 10 ng/ml and 50 ng/ml BMP-4 were added to adipogenic media for 8 days. Oil red-O staining, reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction and immunocytofluorescence staining were performed to examine differentiation of the ASCs. Results As indicated by increased expression of adipogenic and lipogenic genes (PPAR-?, APN and LPL) and proteins, 50 ng/ml BMP-4 seemed to induce mASCs to differentiate into the adipo-lineage compared to 10 ng/ml BMP-4, and control groups. In addition, lipid droplets accumulated within the adipocytes under 50 ng/ml BMP-4 stimulation, as shown by oil red-O staining. Conclusions Our present study suggests that BMP-4, as an adipo-inducing factor, promoted adipogenesis of ASCs at higher concentrations (50 ng/ml) and can perhaps be considered as a candidate for use in adipose tissue engineering.

AB  - Abstract Background & Aims The long-term clinical outcomes in initial survivors with acute liver failure (ALF) are not well known. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the 2-year clinical outcomes among initial survivors and liver transplant (LT) recipients that were alive 3 weeks after enrolment in the Acute Liver Failure Study Group (ALFSG). Methods Outcomes in adult ALFSG patients that were enrolled between 1998 and 2010 were reviewed. Results Two-year patient survival was significantly higher in the 262 LT recipients (92.4%) compared to the 306 acetaminophen (APAP) spontaneous survivors (SS) (89.5%) and 200 non-APAP SS (75.5%) (P < 0.0001). The causes of death were similar in the three groups but the time to death was significantly longer in the LT recipients (P < 0.0001). Independent predictors of 2-year mortality in the APAP group were a high serum phosphate level and patient age (c-statistic = 0.65 (0.54, 0.76)), patient age and days from jaundice to ALF onset in the non-APAP group (c-statistic = 0.69 (0.60, 0.78)), and patient age, days from jaundice, and higher coma grade in the LT recipients (c-statistic = 0.74 (0.61, 0.87)). The LT recipients were significantly more likely to be employed and have a higher educational level (P < 0.05). Conclusions Two-year outcomes in initial survivors of ALF are generally good but non-APAP patients have a significantly lower survival which may relate to pre-existing medical comorbidities. Spontaneous survivors with APAP overdose experience substantial morbidity during follow-up from ongoing psychiatric and substance abuse issues.

AB  - Abstract Application of dynamic mechanical loads on bone and bone explants has been reported to enhance osteogenesis and mineralization. To date, published studies have incorporated a range of cyclic strains on 3D scaffolds and platforms to demonstrate the effect of mechanical loading on osteogenesis. However, most of the loading parameters used in these studies do not emulate the in vivo loading conditions. In addition, the scaffolds/platforms are not representative of the native osteoinductive environment of bone tissue and hence may not be entirely accurate to study the in vivo mechanical loading. We hypothesized that biomimicry of physiological loading will potentiate accelerated osteogenesis in bone grafts. In this study, we present a compression bioreactor system that applies cyclic compression to cellular grafts in a controlled manner. Polycaprolactone-? Tricalcium Phosphate (PCL-TCP) scaffolds seeded with Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) were cyclically compressed in bioreactor for a period of 4 weeks at 1 Hz and physiological strain value of 0.22% for 4 h per day. Gene expression studies revealed increased expressions of osteogenesis-related genes (Osteonectin and COL1A1) on day 7 of cyclic loading group relative to its static controls. Cyclic compression resulted in a 3.76-fold increase in the activity of Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) on day 14 when compared to its static group (p?<?0.001). In addition, calcium deposition of cyclic loading group was found to attain saturation on day 14 (1.96 fold higher than its static scaffolds). The results suggested that cyclic, physiological compression of stem cell-seeded scaffolds generated highly mineralized bone grafts. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract A xenograft (bovine hydroxyapatite [BHA]) was developed from New Zealand sourced bovine cancellous bone by a successful defatting and deproteinizing procedure. The BHA was chemically, compositionally and structurally characterized. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the removal of organic matter from the bone matrix and the presence of carbonate ( ), hydroxyl (OH?), and phosphate ( ) functional groups. X-ray diffraction analysis suggested that the processed bone corresponds characteristically to hydroxyapatite (HA). SEM analysis showed that the BHA has an interconnected porous architecture with a pore diameter ranging from 100 to 700 ?m while µCT analysis calculated the total porosity as 73.46%?±?1.08. Furthermore, the BHA was stable up to 1000°C and lost only 1.8% of its weight. The Ca/P molar ratio of the BHA was 1.58, which is comparable with commercially available natural HA-Endobon?. After 28 days of incubation in simulated body fluid (SBF), the pH value only fluctuated between 7.1 and 7.5 and the BHA scaffold did not degrade significantly by weight indicating the scaffold had excellent chemical and structural stability. In vitro studies showed the BHA was cytocompatible and supported the proliferative growth of Saos-2 osteoblast cells. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating condition with neurological deficits and loss of motor function that, depending on the severity, may lead to paralysis. The only treatment currently available is methylprednisolone, which is widely used and renders limited efficacy in SCI. Therefore, other therapeutic agents must be developed. The neuroprotective efficacy of estrogen in SCI was studied with a pre-clinical and pro-translational perspective. Acute SCI was induced in rats that were treated with low doses of estrogen (1, 5, 10, or 100 ?g/kg) and compared with vehicle-treated injured rats or laminectomy control (sham) rats at 48 h post-SCI. Changes in gliosis and other pro-inflammatory responses, expression and activity of proteolytic enzymes (e.g., calpain, caspase-3), apoptosis of neurons in SCI, and cell death were monitored via Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Negligible pro-inflammatory responses or proteolytic events and very low levels of neuronal death were found in sham rats. In contrast, vehicle-treated SCI rats showed profound pro-inflammatory responses with reactive gliosis, elevated expression and activity of calpain and caspase-3, elevated Bax:Bcl-2 ratio, and high levels of neuronal death in lesion and caudal regions of the injured spinal cord. Estrogen treatment at each dose reduced pro-inflammatory and proteolytic activities and protected neurons in the caudal penumbra in acute SCI. Estrogen treatment at 10 ?g was found to be as effective as 100 ?g in ameliorating the above parameters in injured animals. Results from this investigation indicated that estrogen at a low dose could be a promising therapeutic agent for treating acute SCI. Experimental studies with low dose estrogen therapy in acute spinal cord injury (SCI) demonstrated the potential for multi-active beneficial outcomes. Estrogen has been found to ameliorate several degenerative pathways following SCI. Thus, such early protective effects may even lead to functional recovery in long term injury. Studies are underway in chronic SCI in a follow up manuscript.

AB  - Summary Objective? IGFs and IGF binding proteins in the circulation are subject to modulation by a number of catabolic states including inflammation, trauma and surgery. We sought to determine the impact of laparoscopy on the IGF system in patients diagnosed with acute cholecystitis. Design? The components of the IGF system, cortisol, glucose and insulin concentration in both the serum and urine of patients were compared to those from a healthy group of subjects. An additional comparison was made between pre- and post-laparoscopically assisted patients. Patients? Thirty patients diagnosed with acute cholecystitis and 81 matched controls were included in the study. Measurements? Radioimmunoassays were used to determine the IGF-I, IGF-II, insulin and cortisol concentrations. The concentration of IGFBP-3 was measured using an immunoradiometric assay. The GOD-PAP method was used to determine the glucose concentration. Gel filtration chromatography was performed to calculate the IGF binary/ternary complex ratio. The amount of sialic acid in IGFBP-3 was determined by affinity chromatography. The presence of IGFBPs in serum was determined by both immunoblotting and ligandblotting. Results? The concentrations of circulating IGF-I, IGF-II and IGFBP-3 were significantly reduced in pre-operative patients compared to healthy subjects. No further reductions were observed post-laparoscopy. Immunoblotting and ligandblotting demonstrated a decreased amount of IGFBP-3 in both pre- and post-operative patients compared to healthy subjects. Increased levels of IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-1 were observed in pre-operative patients compared to healthy subjects, but laparoscopy did not cause further elevation. No alteration in the IGF binary/ternary complex ratio was witnessed between any of the study groups. A significant increase in the sialic acid content of IGFBP-3 was seen in both patient groups when compared to healthy subjects. The level of urinary cortisol was significantly increased in post-operative patients, whereas the urinary IGF-I concentration was decreased compared to healthy subjects. Conclusions? Our results indicate that acute cholecystitis causes several significant changes in the circulating IGF system. Laparoscopy, however, does not aggravate such changes, but elevates urinary cortisol.
