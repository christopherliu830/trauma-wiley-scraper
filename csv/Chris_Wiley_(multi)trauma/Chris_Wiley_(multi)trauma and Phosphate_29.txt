AB  - Summary This chapter presents comprehensive information on diagnosing, managing, and preventing surgical complications of Brachycephalic Airway Obstructive Syndrome (BAOS) and serves as a reference to recent literature. BAOS is a complex entity characteristic of brachycephalic breeds. These primary malformations can be associated with numerous other anomalies of the respiratory, cardiovascular, or even gastrointestinal (GI) systems. The complexity of this syndrome leads to increased perianesthetic mortality rates in brachycephalic breeds and a high risk of complications after the surgical management of BAOS. The chapter provides various particularities of these breeds linked with anesthetic risk. Dyspnea during the hours after the recovery phase from surgery for BAOS is the main postoperative complication. It is usually caused by upper airway obstruction; the causes vary as a function of the individual and the type of surgery.

Growth/differentiation factor-5 significantly enhances periodontal wound healing/regeneration compared with platelet-derived growth factor-BB in dogs. J Clin Periodontol 2010; 37: 739-746 doi: 10.1111/j.1600-051X.2010.01576.x. Abstract Objective: Recombinant human growth/differentiation factor-5 (rhGDF-5) in a particulate ?-tricalcium phosphate (?-TCP) carrier is being evaluated to support periodontal regeneration. The objective of this study was to evaluate periodontal wound healing/regeneration following an established clinical (benchmark) protocol including surgical implantation of rhGDF-5/?-TCP in comparison with that following implantation of recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB (rhPDGF) combined with a particulate ?-TCP biomaterial using an established canine defect model. Materials and Methods: Bilateral, 4 ? 5?mm (width ? depth), one-wall, critical-size, intrabony periodontal defects were surgically created at the mandibular second and fourth pre-molar teeth in five adult Beagle dogs. Defect sites were randomized to receive rhGDF-5/?-TCP or the rhPDGF construct followed by wound closure for primary intention healing. The animals were sacrificed following an 8-week healing interval for histological and histometric examination. Results: Clinical healing was generally uneventful. Sites receiving rhGDF-5/?-TCP exhibited a significantly enhanced cementum formation compared with sites receiving the rhPDGF construct, averaging (±SD) 4.49±0.48 versus 2.72±0.91?mm (p<0.001). Similarly, bone regeneration height and area were significantly enhanced at sites receiving rhGDF-5/?-TCP versus that of the rhPDGF construct averaging, 3.08±0.74 versus 1.29±0.78?mm (p<0.001) and 6.03±1.28 versus 2.98±2.61?mm2 (p<0.01), respectively. Cementum regeneration included cellular/acellular mixed (extrinsic/intrinsic) fibre cementum at sites receiving rhGDF-5/?-TCP; sites receiving the rhPDGF/?-TCP showed a pre-dominantly acellular cementum. Newly formed cementum generally extended above the adjoining alveolar bone. Both protocols displayed ?-TCP residues apparently undergoing resorption. Application of both materials appears safe, as they were associated with limited, if any, adverse events. Conclusion: rhGDF-5/?-TCP shows a significant potential to support/accelerate periodontal wound healing/regeneration. Application of rhGDF-5/?-TCP appears safe and should be further evaluated in human clinical trials.

AB  - Injectable and settable biomaterials are a growing class of therapeutic technologies within the field of regenerative medicine. These materials offer advantages compared to prefabricated implants because of their ability to be utilized as part of noninvasive surgical procedures, fill complex defect shapes, cure in situ, and incorporate cells and other active biologics. However, there are significant technical barriers to clinical translation of injectable and settable biomaterials, such as achieving clinically relevant handling properties and benign reaction conditions. This review focuses on the engineering challenges associated with the design and development of injectable and chemically settable polymeric biomaterials. Additionally, specific examples of the diverse chemistries utilized to overcome these challenges are covered. The future translation of injectable and settable biomaterials is anticipated to improve patient outcomes for a number of clinical conditions. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report signalment, clinical signs, preoperative staging tests, histologic diagnosis, surgical, and oncologic outcomes including postoperative limb use, in dogs with scapular tumors treated by scapulectomy. Study Design Retrospective case series Animals Dogs (n?=?42) with scapular tumors. Methods Medical records (1995?2010) from 6 hospitals were searched for dogs with scapular tumors treated by scapulectomy. Data retrieved were: signalment, weight, percentage of scapula removed, histologic diagnosis, postoperative limb use, adjunctive therapy, disease free interval (DFI), and survival time (ST). Individual variables were modeled with a Cox proportional hazard model accounting for censoring to determine risk factors for decreased DFI and ST. For categorical variables, Kaplan?Meier survival plots as well as mean and median survival times (MSTs) were calculated. Results Subtotal scapulectomy was performed in 18 dogs (42.9%). Osteosarcoma (OSA) was diagnosed in 27 dogs (64.3%). Limb use was evaluated immediately after surgery in 41 dogs. Information on limb use at other times (1, 2, 3, and >3 months) postoperatively was also available for some dogs and was good to excellent overall. Only adjunctive chemotherapy had a positive significant effect on DFI (P?=?.00011) and ST (P?=?.0003). Conclusion Canine scapular tumors can be treated effectively by scapulectomy and limb use is fair to excellent for most dogs. OSA was the most common scapular tumor. Overall prognosis for scapular OSA is similar to appendicular OSA at other sites and use of adjunctive chemotherapy prolonged the overall DFI and MST.

AB  - Objective? To characterize biologic behavior, clinical outcome, and effect of histologic grade on prognosis for dogs with appendicular chondrosarcoma treated by amputation alone. Study Design? Case series. Animals? Dogs (n=25) with appendicular chondrosarcoma. Methods? Medical records were searched to identify dogs with appendicular chondrosarcoma treated by limb amputation alone. Information recorded included signalment, anatomic location, radiographic appearance, and development of metastasis. Histopathologic diagnosis was confirmed and graded (1, 2, or 3). Survival curves were generated by the Kaplan?Meier method and the association between covariates (gender, age, weight, and tumor grade) and survival were evaluated using the univariate proportional hazards model. Results? Histopathology slides were available for 25 dogs. Rates of pulmonary metastasis were as follows: grade 1?0%, grade 2?31%, and grade 3?50%. Overall median survival time (MST) was 979 days. Age, weight, and sex were not significantly associated with survival (P=.16; .33; and .31, respectively). Survival was significantly associated with tumor grade (P=.008), with dogs with tumor grade of 1, 2, and 3 having MSTs of 6, 2.7, and 0.9 years, respectively. Conclusion? Canine appendicular chondrosarcoma can be treated effectively with amputation alone. Low to intermediate grade chondrosarcoma has a good prognosis, whereas high-grade tumors appear to behave aggressively. Clinical Relevance? The overall prognosis for appendicular chondrosarcoma is better than that of appendicular osteosarcoma treated by amputation alone or in combination with chemotherapy.

AB  - A 42-year-old female Testudo graeca was referred with a five-month history of a non-healing carapacial wound. Previous treatment had involved long-term antibiotic therapy and conscious debridement of necrotic tissue. On presentation an extensive deep wound with purulent discharge was visible on the right side of the carapace. A computed tomographic scan was performed to assess the extent of the wound. This revealed a large carapacial deficit with two underlying soft tissue masses. Surgical debridement was performed under general anaesthesia resulting in an even larger defect. Because of the extensive nature of the deficit, negative pressure wound therapy was applied to aid wound healing. A negative pressure of approximately 120?mmHg was maintained and bandages were changed every third day. Wound healing progressed rapidly and a healthy granulation bed was formed within 16 days.

AB  - The large bulk of lost craniofacial soft tissue is mainly adipose tissue. Current surgical approaches following tumor resection and trauma have limitations. Adipose derived-stromal cells (ADSCs), also named as preadipocytes, have been demonstrated to be a good cell candidate for adipose tissue engineering. However, characteristics of scaffold played important role in a successful tissue engineered adipose tissue. Objectives:? The present study is to investigate whether in vitro adipogenesis could be induced both in a monolayer and 3-D by ADSCs. Methods:? Healthy adult ADSCs were isolated by liposuction from fat pads. After discarding the unattached cells, the ADSCs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics until they reached confluence. After trypsinization, ADSCs were subcultured at a density of 105 cells/100?mm-dish as a first passage. The monolayer and 3-D adipogenesis were assessed after seeding 105 ADSCs into each well of 6-well plates and 5???106 ADSCs/ml into biodegradable collagen sponges, respectively, followed by replacement of basic medium with adipogenic one. Results:? In both monolayer and 3-D scaffolds, lipids containing adipocytes were observed 1 week after adipogenic stimulation, and further increased over the time. By contrast, no adipogenesis was observed in ADSCs cultured in basic medium. Conclusions:? Human adipose-derived stromal cells isolated from fat pads can readily be induced toward adipogenesis in vitro. The in vivo adipogenesis potential of ADSCs is being investigated.

AB  - Prolonged urinary cannabinoid excretion in chronic frequent cannabis users confounds identification of recent cannabis intake that may be important in treatment, workplace, clinical, and forensic testing programs. In addition, differentiation of synthetic ?9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) intake from cannabis plant products might be an important interpretive issue. THC, 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC) and 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC (THCCOOH) urine concentrations were evaluated during previous controlled cannabis administration studies following tandem alkaline/E. coli ?-glucuronidase hydrolysis. We optimized recombinant ?-glucuronidase enzymatic urinary hydrolysis before simultaneous liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC?MS/MS) quantification of THC, 11-OH-THC, THCCOOH, cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), cannabigerol (CBG), tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) and 11-nor-9-carboxy-THCV (THCVCOOH) in urine. Enzyme amount, incubation time and temperature, buffer molarity and pH were optimized using pooled urine samples collected during a National Institute on Drug Abuse, Institutional Review Board-approved clinical study. Optimized cannabinoid hydrolysis with recombinant ?-glucuronidase was achieved with 2000 IU enzyme, 2 M pH 6.8 sodium phosphate buffer, and 0.2 mL urine at 37°C for 16 h. The LC?MS/MS quantification method for hydrolyzed urinary cannabinoids was validated per the Scientific Working Group on Toxicology guidelines. Linear ranges were 1?250 ?g/L for THC and CBG, 2?250 ?g/L for 11-OH-THC, CBD, CBN, THCV and THCVCOOH, and 1?500 ?g/L for THCCOOH. Inter-batch analytical bias was 92.4?112.4%, imprecision 4.4?9.3% CV (n = 25), extraction efficiency 44.3?97.1% and matrix effect ?29.6 to 1.8% (n = 10). The method was utilized to analyze urine specimens collected during our controlled smoked, vaporized, and edible cannabis administration study to improve interpretation of urine cannabinoid test results.

AB  - Abstract The influence of temperature on the stability of human serum albumin (HSA) pharmaceutical preparations has been studied by size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography with multi-angle laser-light-scattering detection and by particle-size analysis. The behaviour of HSA in two pharmaceutical preparations stored at different temperatures (40, 55 and 70°C) followed the same pattern?an increase in the relative percentage of dimer (MW 132 000 Da) and aggregate (MW > 200 000 Da), and then a decrease in the concentration of all species and, finally, sudden protein coagulation. These results suggest a time- and temperature-dependent process. At 70°C, monomer only was detected for both preparations; the amount remaining was 83 and 72% for formulations A and B, respectively. Analysis of size-distribution curves also seems to confirm these results. Initially, three distributions were observed with length-volume mean diameters (dl,v)of 1.67, 10.6 and 57 ?m. After 80 days at 55°C, only two distributions were observed, with dl,v of 3.07 and 76 ?m. An additional study using pure HSA at different concentrations (0.3, 2.5, 5 and 10% w/v) and storage at 75°C was performed to determine the influence of the concentration of auxiliary substances and of the HSA. Only when the HSA concentration was 0.3% w/v did the remaining fraction of HSA fit a Prout-Thompkins nucleation model. Initially three distributions with mean sizes of 2, 20 and 40 ?m were observed whereas at the end of the assay only one distribution, mean size 129 ?m, was seen. The methodology used enabled us to separate the HSA degradation products and to determine the absolute molecular weight of albumin monomer and dimer. It is possible to conclude that the degradation mechanism for the formulations studied is complex, and that it is possible to fit the degradation data to Prout-Thompkins kinetics only when the concentration of HSA is low enough (0.3% w/v).

Study Design In vitro study. Sample Population Synoviocytes from dogs (n?=?8) with naturally occurring cruciate ligament insufficiency. Methods Synoviocytes were cultured in monolayer and synthesized into tensioned synoviocyte bioscaffolds (TSB) suspended in media containing TGF-?3, or FGF-2, TGF-?1, and IGF-I. The 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay and toluidine blue stain assessed glycosaminoglycan content; hydroxyproline assay, and collagen I and II immunohistochemistry assessed collagen content. Biomechanical properties were determined by materials testing/force?deformation curves. Results All tissue cultures formed tensioned fibrous tissue-like constructs. Mean tissue cellularity and cellular viability was significantly greater in the triple growth factor-treated TSB by 0.09% and 44%, respectively. Percentage collagen content, and relative gene expression for collagen I, II, and aggrecan was not significantly different between groups. Median percentage of GAG content was significantly greater in triple growth factor-treated TSB by 1.6%. Biomechanical properties were not different in compression. Triple growth factor-treated TSB were significantly stronger in toughness, peak load to failure, and stiffness in tension. Conclusions TGF-?3 cultured bioscaffolds failed to outperform triple growth factor-treated TSB. Architectural extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and cellularity likely explained the differences between groups. TGF-?3 alone cannot be recommended at this time for in vitro formation of autologous fibrocartilage bioscaffolds for meniscal deficiency.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Sacroiliac joint injuries can cause poor performance; however, the interaction between pelvic mechanics and the sacroiliac joint is poorly understood. Objective: To measure pelvic displacement during 3D sacroiliac joint loading. Methods: Nine reflective triads were attached rigidly to bony prominences in sacropelvic specimens harvested from 14 horses for stereophotogrammetric analysis of triad displacements and joint kinematics. The sacrum was coupled to a load cell and mounted vertically within a material testing system (MTS). A pneumatic actuator was used to apply 90 Nm moments to the ischial arch to simulate nutation-counternutation and left and right lateral bending of the sacroiliac joints. Axial rotation of the sacrum was induced by torsion of the upper MTS fixture. Vectors of marker displacement within orthogonal planes of motion were measured during loading of the sacropelvic specimens. Comparisons in the magnitude and direction of triad displacements were made between paired left-right markers and paired loading conditions. Results: Nutation-counternutation of the sacroiliac joint caused vertical displacement of the ischial tuberosities and cranial-caudal displacement of the wings of the ilium. Lateral bending induced rotational displacement within the horizontal plane of all pelvic landmarks, relative to the sacrum. Axial rotation of the sacrum caused elevation of the wing of the ilium ipsilateral to the direction of sacral rotation and depression of the contralateral ilial wing. Significant paired left-right differences occurred during most sacroiliac joint loading conditions. Comparable magnitudes of pelvic displacement were measured during nutation-counternutation, left and right lateral bending, and left and right axial rotation. Conclusions: The equine pelvis is not a rigid structure and asymmetric pelvic deformation occurs during most sacroiliac joint movements. Clinical relevance: Bony pelvic deformation should be considered a normal response to any sacroiliac joint movement.

AB  - Summary This chapter explores the main tasks a foundation doctor can expect to face in their surgical job, and provides practical tips and advice to guide them in becoming a proficient, confident, multi-tasking junior surgeon. All patients undergoing elective surgery will be assessed preoperatively, usually in pre-assessment clinics a few weeks prior to surgery. To reduce the risk of aspiration during anaesthesia, patients are fasted preoperatively. Obtaining consent is an art combining communication skills, surgical knowledge and perception. Further to all the checks doctor have done, further perioperative checks are done according to the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist. Thromboprophylaxis is essential in the surgical setting. One of doctor's most important roles on the wards will be management of post-operative patients. They will need a constant degree of suspicion for emerging complications, which may be directly related to surgery or indirect responses to the physiological stresses of surgery and anaesthesia.

AB  - Abstract Objectives/Hypothesis: Bacterial biofilms are prevalent in pediatric tracheostomy tubes (TTs) and are not completely cleared by standard cleaning with gauze and household detergents. We aimed to examine the effectiveness of different disinfecting solutions to remove Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and Pseudomonas aerginosa (PA) biofilms from TTs. Study Design: Prospective, controlled, in vitro microbiologic study. Methods: Uniform coupons obtained from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pediatric TTs were briefly exposed to human plasma. The samples were incubated in growth media with either PA or SA for 7 days, and total bacterial growth was monitored by media turbidity. Five sets of 18 coupons each were exposed for 5 minutes to one of five different solutions: 2% aqueous chlorhexidine gluconate solution, 0.3% aqueous sodium hypochlorite, Polident denture cleanser, 3% hydrogen peroxide, or preservative-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a negative control. Biofilm presence was measured with bacterial counts, and surface integrity was assessed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results: All treatments significantly reduced mean SA counts (P = <.001). Sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine were more effective than peroxide and Polident. Chlorhexidine, sodium hypochlorite, and peroxide reduced PA counts (P = .001, .001, and .002, respectively), but Polident tabs had no significant effect. SEM revealed preserved TT surface integrity after exposure to all solutions. Conclusions: Disinfection with sodium hypochlorite or chlorhexidine solutions significantly reduces SA and PA biofilms on PVC TTs. Standard home care of reusable pediatric TTs may be improved by use of these readily available solutions. Laryngoscope, 2013

AB  - Recent advances in diffusion MRI employ multiple diffusion encoding schemes with varying diffusion direction, weighting, and diffusion time to investigate specific microstructural properties in biological tissues. In this study, we examined time-dependent diffusion kurtosis contrast in adult mouse brains and in neonatal mouse brains after hypoxic?ischemic (HI) injury. In vivo diffusion kurtosis maps were acquired with a short diffusion time using an oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) sequence at 100 Hz and with a relatively long diffusion time (20 ms) using a pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) sequence. In the adult mouse brain, we found that the cortex and hippocampus showed larger differences between OGSE kurtosis and PGSE kurtosis than major white matter tracts. In neonatal mouse brains with unilateral HI injury, the OGSE kurtosis map overall provided stronger edema contrast than the PGSE kurtosis map, and the differences between OGSE and PGSE kurtosis measurements in the edema region reflected heterogeneity of injury. This is the first in vivo study that has demonstrated multi-direction OGSE kurtosis contrasts in the mouse brain. Comparing PGSE and OGSE kurtosis measures may provide additional information on microstructural changes after ischemic stroke.

AB  - Abstract Accurate assessment of the pregnant patient in the ED depends on knowledge of physiological changes in pregnancy, and how these changes may impact on pathology tests, appearance on point-of-care ultrasound and electrocardiography. In addition the emergency physician needs to be cognisant of disorders that are unique to or more common in pregnancy. Part 1 of this review addresses potential deviations in laboratory investigation reference intervals resulting from physiological alterations in pregnancy, and the important causes of abnormal laboratory results in pregnancy. Part 2 will address the role of point-of-care ultrasound in pregnancy, physiological changes that may affect interpretation of point-of-care ultrasound, physiological changes in electrocardiography, and the safety of radiological procedures in the pregnant patient.

AB  - Trace elements are essential for many physiologic processes. In recent years, supplementation has been studied for a variety of indications, including glycemic control, wound healing, antioxidant effect, and anemia. Critical illness, especially states such as burns, traumas, and septic shock, is associated with inflammatory and oxidative stress, immune dysfunction, and malnutrition. In these patients, enteral and parenteral nutrition or pharmaceutical supplementation is used to provide essential macronutrients, including trace elements. The purpose of this review is to describe trace element supplementation, including iron, copper, chromium, manganese, selenium, and zinc, and highlight their mechanism, pharmacology, outcome data, and adverse effects.

AB  - Eur J Clin Invest 2012 Abstract Background? This study tested the hypothesis that surgical stress and the host response to this trauma trigger an inflammatory cascade in which the neutrophil plays a central role. We hypothesised that pre-operative neutrophil migratory responses will correlate with post-operative clinical outcome in our shock model of open-heart surgery patients. We also tested the hypothesis that surface expression of adhesion molecules involved in the migratory process ? CD11b, CD47 and CD99 ? could be used to predict outcome. We believe that combining neutrophil migratory response, CD11b, CD47 and CD99 with the logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) will strengthen the power of the EuroSCORE not only in predicting post-operative mortality but also other clinical endpoints. Materials and methods? Neutrophils were isolated pre-operatively from n?=?31 patients undergoing open-heart surgery and allowed to migrate across endothelial monolayers in response to N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine (fMLP). Isolated neutrophils were also assessed for surface expression of CD11b, CD47 and CD99 in response to fMLP by flow cytometry. Post-operative clinical parameters collected included days 1?5 white cell count and creatinine levels as well as intensive care unit (ICU) and post-operative hospital stay. Results? Pre-operative surface expression of CD99 and CD47 correlates with post-operative creatinine levels (P?<?0·05), a measurement of renal injury. We also show that while the logistic EuroSCORE alone can be used as a predictor of ICU stay, when combined with pre-operative CD99 surface expression, it improves its AUC value (0·794). Conclusion? Immunological markers, specifically the ability of the neutrophil to migrate, combined with the logistic EuroSCORE lead to improved sensitivity and specificity to predict patient outcome.

AB  - Glenohumeral joint subluxation and reflex sympathetic dystrophy in hemiplegic patients. (Kocaeli University, Kocaeli, Turkey) Arch Phys Med Rehabil 1999; 81:944?946. This is a case-controlled study of the relationship between glenohumeral joint subluxation and reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) in hemiplegic patients set in an inpatient rehabilitation hospital. Thirty-five hemiplegic patients with RSD (RSD group) and 35 hemiplegic patients without RSD (non-RSD group) were included in this study. Patients with rotator cuff rupture, brachial plexus injury, or spasticity greater than stage 2 on the Ashworth scale were excluded. Both the RSD and non-RSD groups were assessed for presence and grade of subluxation from radiographs using a 5-point categorization. The degree of shoulder pain of the non-RSD group was assessed by a visual analogue scale of 10 points. Glenohumeral subluxation was found in 74.3% of the RSD group and 40% of the non-RSD group (P = 0.004). In the non-RSD group, 78.6% of the patients with subluxation and 38.1% of the patients without subluxation reported shoulder pain (P = 0.019). No correlation was found between the degree of shoulder pain and grade of subluxation in the non-RSD group (P = 0.152). Conclude that the findings suggest that shoulder subluxation may be a causative factor for RSD. Therefore, prevention and appropriate treatment of glenohumeral joint subluxation should be included in rehabilitation of hemiplegic patients. Comment by Miles Day, MD. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between shoulder subluxation in hemiplegic patients and reflex sympathetic dystrophy. They also examined if subluxation is associated with shoulder pain and the grade of subluxation in patients with subluxation and no reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD). Patients with injuries to the rotator cuff of the brachial plexus, marked spasticity, and major trauma to joint structures were excluded as these can be precipitating factors for RSD. The study noted a significantly higher presence of shoulder subluxation within the RSD group and the presence of pain was significantly high in patients with shoulder subluxation in the non-RSD group. The take home message of this article is that any measure or treatment that can be applied to the glenohumeral joint should be performed to eliminate the possibility of the patient developing RSD and subsequently hindering further rehabilitation in these patients.

AB  - We report a 6-month old male infant who presented to our pediatric dermatology clinic with a generalized bullous eruption since three months of age. A sepsis work up performed prior to presentation did not reveal any evidence of infection. Clinical presentation revealed multiple tense bullae in a ?string of pearls? arrangement and multiple erosions on the bilateral upper extremities and trunk. This clinical presentation was strongly suggestive of chronic bullous disease of childhood. Laboratory evaluation revealed a normal complete blood cell count and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase level. Polymerase chain reaction for herpes simplex virus types I and II was negative. Histological sections demonstrated a large space of separation between the epidermis and dermis which was filled by a monomorphous infiltrate composed of round to oval cells with centrally placed nuclei, consistent with mast cells. Leder and c-kit stains were strongly positive confirming the diagnosis of bullous mastocytosis. Direct immunofluorescence did not reveal IgA deposits or any other findings. Treatment included fluocinonide 0.05% cream QAM and tacrolimus 0.1% ointment QHS to active lesions, and silver sulfadiazine 1% cream to erosions. Improvement was noted during follow up examination.

AB  - Abstract Cartilage is a highly organized avascular soft tissue that assembles from nano-to macro-scale to produce a complex structural network. To mimic cartilage tissue, we developed a stable multilayered composite material, characterized by a tailored gradient of mechanical properties. The optimized procedure implies chemical crosslinking of each layer directly onto the previous one and ensures a drastic reduction of the material discontinuities and brittleness. The multilayered composite was characterized by infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetry, and scanning electron microscopy in order to compare its physico-chemical characteristics with those of cartilage tissue. The rheological behavior of the multilayered composite was similar to that of human cartilage. Finally its cytocompatibility toward chondrocytes and osteoblasts was evaluated. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part A: 103A: 2521?2530, 2015.
