AB  - Abstract The Chinese herb, Gu-Sui-Bu (GSB) (Drynaria fortunei J. Sm.) has been anecdotally reported to enhance bone healing. We had previously confirmed in vitro the efficacy and safety of GSB in bone healing, and showed that it influenced both osteoblast and osteoclast activity. For clinically useful application of these bone regenerative effects, a satisfactory delivery system for GSB is required. In this study, we determined the optimal concentration of GSB for regenerative activity in rat bone cells via MTT, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), nodule formation and TRAP assays, and designed and tested a GSB-rich bone composite material. The composite was fabricated by mixing a biodegradable GGT composite, containing genipin cross-linked gelatin and tricalcium phosphate, with the predetermined concentration of GSB (GGT-GSB). Neonatal rat calvarial culture and animal implantation were employed to evaluate and compare in vitro and in vivo the potential of GGT-GSB and GGT in regeneration of defective bone tissue. The most effective concentration of GSB was 100 ?g/mL, which significantly increased osteoblast numbers, intracellular ALP levels and nodule numbers, without influencing osteoclast activity. In vitro and in vivo tests also showed that GGT-GSB accelerated bone regeneration compared to GGT. GGT-GSB thus has great potential for improved bone repair. ? 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: Few data are available to establish recommendations for trace element supplementation during critical illness. This study quantified the loss of several elements and assessed the adequacy of manganese and selenium in parenteral nutrition (PN). Methods: Men with traumatic injuries were grouped by renal status: adequate (POLY; n = 6), acute failure with continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH; n = 2), or continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHD; n = 4). PN supplied 300 ?g/d manganese and 60 ?g/d selenium. Urine and effluent (from artificial kidneys) were collected for 3 days and analyzed for boron, manganese, nickel, and silicon using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry, and for selenium using atomic absorption spectrometry. Results: POLY manganese and selenium excretion averaged (standard deviation [SD]) 7.9 (3.3)? g/d and 103.5 (22.4) ?g/d, respectively. All elements except selenium were detected in dialysate (prior to use). CVVHD effluent contained 3.5 and 7.3 times more manganese and nickel than CVVH ultrafiltrate, respectively. Loss of manganese averaged 2.6%, 21%, and 73% of PN amounts for POLY, CVVH, and CVVHD groups, respectively. Discussion: Minimal loss of manganese compared with the amount in PN suggests that excessive amounts are retained. POLY patients excreted more selenium than was in PN, indicating negative balance. POLY losses of boron and silicon were less than that published for healthy adults, reflecting less than typical intake, whereas loss during CVVH was in the normal reference range, possibly because of added intake from boron contamination of replacement fluids. All patients lost more nickel than amounts published for healthy adults. Conclusions: Current guidelines of 60-100 ?g/d of parenteral manganese may be excessive for trauma patients. The uptake of manganese and nickel from contaminants in CVVHD dialysate should be investigated.

AB  - Abstract During the past two decades, with a huge and rapidly increasing clinical need for bone regeneration and repair, bone substitutes are more and more seen as a potential solution. Major innovation efforts are being made to develop such substitutes, some having advanced even to clinical practice. It is now time to turn to natural biomaterials. Nacre, or mother-of-pearl, is an organic matrix-calcium carbonate coupled shell structure produced by molluscs. In vivo and in vitro studies have revealed that nacre is osteoinductive, osteoconductive, biocompatible, and biodegradable. With many other outstanding qualities, nacre represents a natural and multi-use biomaterial as a bone graft substitute. This review aims at summarising the current needs in orthopaedic clinics and the challenges for the development of bone substitutes; most of all, we systematically review the physiological characteristics and biological evidence of nacre's effects centred on osteogenesis, and finally we put forward the potential use of nacre as a bone graft substitute. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract C-reactive protein (CRP) is a nonspecific biomarker of inflammation and infection that can be used as a predictive risk marker of cardiovascular disease in asymptomatic individuals or as a prognostic marker of recurrent ischemia and death among patients with coronary heart disease or stroke. We developed a sensitive, disposable, and easy to operate sensor based on heterogeneous sandwich immunoassay for high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) measurement. We used screen-printed electrodes modified with multi-walled carbon nanotubes and protein A to ensure the oriented immobilization of anti-CRP antibodies. CRP was quantitatively measured down to a concentration of 0.5?ng mL?1, enabling high dilution of the samples before measurement and consequently reducing interferences present in the serum. The sensor developed is suitable for point of care detection of hs-CRP at clinically relevant concentrations for the diagnosis of both conventional and low-grade inflammations.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The aim of this pre-clinical study was to evaluate the biological performance of two injectable calcium phosphate cement (CPC) composite materials containing poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic)acid (PLGA) microspheres with different properties in a maxillary sinus floor elevation model in sheep. Materials and methods PLGA microspheres were made of either low molecular weight (~17 kDa) acid-terminated PLGA (PLGAL-AT) or high molecular weight (~44 kDa) end-capped PLGA (PLGAH-EC) and incorporated in CPC. Eight female Swifter sheep underwent a bilateral maxillary sinus floor elevation procedure via an extra-oral approach. All animals received both materials, alternately injected in the left and right sinus (split-mouth model) and a time point of 12 weeks was used. Analysis of biological performance was based on histology, histomorphometry, and evaluation of sequential fluorochrome labeling. Results Both types of CPC-PLGA composites showed biocompatibility and direct bone-cement contact. CPC-PLGAL-AT showed a significantly higher degradation distance compared to CPC-PLGAH-EC (1949 ± 1295 ?m vs. 459 ± 267 ?m; P = 0.0107). Further, CPC-PLGAL-AT showed significantly more bone in the region of interest (26.4 ± 10.5% vs. 8.6 ± 3.9% for PLGAH-EC; P = 0.0009) and significantly less remaining CPC material (61.2 ± 17.7% vs. 81.9 ± 10.9% for PLGAH-EC; P = 0.0192). Conclusions Both CPC-PLGAL-AT and CPC-PLGAH-EC demonstrated to be safe materials for sinus floor elevation procedures in a large animal model, presenting biocompatibility and direct bone contact. In view of material performance, CPC-PLGAL-AT showed significantly faster degradation and a significantly higher amount of newly formed bone compared to CPC-PLGAH-EC.

AB  - Hyperphosphatemia and poor uremia control are established cardiovascular risk factors in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) associated with impaired endothelial dependent and independent vasodilation (EDV and EIV). Nocturnal hemodialysis [6???8?h/week] augments dialysis dose and offers normal phosphate (Pi) balance. We hypothesized that NHD would restore EDV (endothelial function) and EIV (vascular smooth muscle cell function) by simultaneously improving uremia and Pi control. 2 groups of ESRD patients (mean age 41?±?2 years) stratified according to their baseline plasma Pi levels (normal Pi <1.8?mM, high Pi >1.8?mM) were studied. Dialysis dose (Kt/V per session), plasma Pi, blood pressure (BP) and brachial artery responses to reactive hyperemia (EDV), and sublingual nitroglycerin (EIV) were examined before, 1 and 2 months after conversion from conventional hemodialysis (CHD) [3???4?h/week] to NHD. After 2 months, NHD increased dialysis dose (from 1.24?±?0.06 to 2.04?±?0.08; p?=?0.02) and lowered BP (from 140?±?5/82?±?3 to 119?±?1/71?±?3, p?=?0.01) in all patients. In patients with adequate Pi control during CHD, EDV was normalized after 1 month of NHD. In contrast, in the high Pi group, 1 month of NHD was sufficient to reduce plasma phosphate levels, but 2 months of NHD was required for EDV to improve. Variables Normal Pi (n=10) CHD NHD (1month) NHD (2months) High Pi (n=8) CHD NHD (1month) NHD (2 months) Pi (mM) ?1.44?±?0.09 1.08?±?0.07* 1.14?±?0.11* 2.52?±?0.3 1.40?±?0.17* 1.26?±?0.05* EDV (%) ?3.4?±?2.7 7.5?±?1.9* 7.6?±?1.3* ?1.7?±?1.3 0.37?±?1.6? ?8.8?±?1.2* EIV (%) ?8.2?±?4.8 10.3?±?2.0 15.1?±?2.0* 5.1?±?1.1 ?6.6?±?0.8? 16.9?±?1.7* * p?<?0.05 from values during CHD. ? p?<?0.05 between the normal and high Pi groups. Correction of uremia without normalization of plasma Pi is insufficient to improve EDV. The time course over which this improvement in vascular responsiveness occurs is delayed in hyperphosphatemic patients, suggesting that improvement in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell function requires restoration of normal intracellular Pi balance.

AB  - Well over 80 years ago Philip Smith described the beneficial clinical effects of adrenocortical extracts in animal models of adrenal insufficiency. In the ensuing years, scientists across the globe have sought to understand the mechanisms by which adrenal hormones and their synthetic analogues produce their complex and varied actions. Particular attention has focused on the glucocorticoids, partly because they have a vital place in the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders but also because dysregulation of the secretion and/or activity of endogenous glucocorticoids is increasingly implicated in a number of common disorders that pose a growing clinical burden, such as obesity, type II diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, hypertension and depression. This review considers some of the key advances that have been made in our understanding of the physiology, pathology and pharmacology of the glucocorticoids. Emphasis is placed on the molecular mechanisms of glucocorticoid signalling and the complex mechanisms that regulate the access of steroids in the systemic circulation to their receptors in their various target cells and tissues. In addition, consideration is given to the irreversible ?organisational? actions of glucocorticoids in perinatal life and to the potential role of the steroids in the aetiology of disease.

AB  - Background Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cells, originally identified in bone-marrow. Little is known about MSCs of the head and neck region. We investigated cell biological properties with a potential impact on wound healing of 2 different tissue-resident MSC populations. Methods MSCs were isolated from human nasal mucosa (nmMSCs) and parotid gland (pgMSCs). Clonogenic potential, cell surface markers, cytokine secretion, chemokine receptor expression, mobility, and adhesion to extracellular matrix were examined in unstimulated and stimulated MSCs. Results NmMSCs had the higher clonogenic potential. PgMSCs showed a broader panel of chemokine receptor expression and displayed higher mobility, especially after challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). NmMSCs were less mobile and showed increased LPS-induced secretion of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) compared with pgMSCs. Conclusion These data highlight functional differences between tissue-resident MSCs of the head and neck region, which may impact functional properties of these cells in response to trauma or infection. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Osteopenia and osteoporosis affect over 40 million US adults 50?years and older. Both diseases are strongly influenced by estrogen and nutritional?mineral deficiencies. This study investigates the efficacy of orally delivered synthetic-bone-mineral (SBM), a newly developed calcium phosphate based biomaterial, on reversing bone loss induced by these two critical deficiencies. Thirty 3-month-old female rats were randomly allocated to either control?sham surgery on normal diet; or one of the four experimental groups: Sham surgery on a low mineral diet (LMD), ovariectomized (OVX) on LMD, OVX on LMD with SBM with/without fluoride (F). The rats were sacrificed after 6 months, at 9-month-old. After 6 months, although all groups lost bone mineral density relative to controls, the supplemented OVX rats showed higher bone mineral density than their unsupplemented counterparts. The 2 SBM supplemented groups improved bone loading capacity by 28.1 and 35.4% compared to the OVX LMD group. Bones from supplemented rats exhibited higher inorganic/organic ratios. The addition of F did not have a significant influence on bone loss. Our findings suggest that SBM supplement is effective in maintaining bone health and offsetting the deleterious effects of estrogen and/or mineral deficiencies on bone density, microarchitecture, and strength.

AB  - Abstract Based on well-documented data showing that bioactive ions (such as Ca2+, PO4?, etc.) released by BCPC induce various cell responses and on the significance of herpes outbreaks in human pathology, we investigated whether BCPC can modify cell response to HSV-1 infection. The roles of some physical and chemical properties of ceramics were evaluated using three BCPC samples?French commercial macro-microporous (FR) and two Bulgarian microporous laboratory samples?one of which was modified with magnesium (BG and BG + Mg). Samples only washed in 0.9% NaCl were designated as nonconditioned while those resuspended in cell growth medium for 10 days after washing were designated as conditioned. Experiments were done on cells from the continuous MDBK line precultured on BCPC surfaces for different time intervals and thereafter HSV-1 infected. The yield of infectious virus progeny, measured as virus titers, was the parameter used to determine the cell response to HSV-1 infection mediated by BCPC as compared to that of the virus control, that is, virus yield in cells cultured without BCPC. The data obtained show that all three nonconditioned BCPC samples were able to modify cells to resist HSV-1 infection. The prolongation of the resistant state depended on the specific physical and chemical properties of the particular BCPC sample: as the data show that the conditioning procedure (1) increased the ability of BG + Mg to promote cell resistance, and (2) reduced the ability of FR samples to modify cells to resist HSV-1 infection. The data obtained show that apart from Ca2+ and PO4?, ions of biometals such as Mg2+ also are responsible for the induction and maintenance of cell resistance to HSV-1 infection. ? 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Neutron activation analysis has been used to determine the total content in the body of N, K, Na, Cl, P and Ca in 25 critically ill surgical patients before and after a 14-day course of intravenous nutrition. Muscle elemental compostion was also determined in these patients at the same time as the total body analysis. Over the 14-day period of intravenous feeding the total body contents of all the measured elements increased (2?9·7 per cent) but only the increase in K was statistically significant. Muscle chemistry suggested an intracellular K depletion which was corrected over the study period. The results of the total body multi-element analysis were interpreted to show a mean gain of 1·25 l of extracellular fluid and 0·51 l of intracellular fluid and direct measurement of total body water suggested that this interpretation was probably valid. The first application of the technique to patients with nutritional and metabolic problems has quantified the weight gained by two body compartments during a 2-week period of intravenous nutrition. Its further application should help to solve a number of nutritional and metabolic problems in clinical surgery.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate whether CD34+ purified human muscle-derived cells (hMDCs) are capable of multiple lineage differentiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS The hMDCs were isolated from human skeletal muscle and purified using a CD34+ cell selection system (Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway). Adherent populations of cells were expanded in culture and cell differentiation was induced using different kinds of growth factors and different differentiation-conditional media. The immunohistochemical properties of CD34+ hMDCs were examined after varying periods in culture. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to investigate the gene expression of the undifferentiated and differentiated hMDCs. RESULTS Using special differentiation conditions the CD34+ hMDCs could be differentiated into myogenic cells, adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes. The differentiation was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. RT-PCR and Western blotting showed multiple-lineage gene-level expression in the different cultivation periods of the differentiated cells. CONCLUSIONS We confirmed the multi-lineage capacity of a population of stem cells, termed CD34+ hMDCs. Our findings showed that CD34+ hMDCs are capable of multiple mesodermal-lineage differentiation, as shown by the expression of several lineage-specific genes. They can be differentiated toward the myogenic, osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages. These cells might have potential for use in tissue regeneration.

Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the scaffold material was performed by X-ray synchrotron radiation computed microtomography (microCT) with a spatial resolution lower than 5 µm. Unique to these experiments was that microCT data were first collected on the scaffolds before implantation and then on the same scaffolds after they were seeded with BMSC, implanted in the mice and rescued after different times. Volume fraction, mean thickness and thickness distribution were evaluated for both new bone and scaffold phases as a function of the implantation time. New bone thickness increased from week 8 to week 16. Data for the implanted scaffolds were compared with those derived from the analysis of the same scaffolds prior to implantation and with data derived from 100% hydroxyapatite (HA) scaffold treated and analyzed in the same way. At variance with findings with the 100% HA scaffolds a significant variation in the density of the different Si-TCP scaffold regions in the pre- and post-implantation samples was observed. In particular a post-implantation decrease in the density of the scaffolds, together with major changes in the scaffold phase composition, was noticeable in areas adjacent to newly formed bone. Histology confirmed a better integration between new bone and scaffold in the Si-TCP composites in comparison to 100% HA composites where new bone and scaffold phases remained well distinct.

AB  - Abstract Objective Yiqifumai injection is a compound Chinese medicine used to treat microcirculatory disturbance-related diseases clinically. Our previous study proved that Yiqifumai injection pretreatment inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced venular albumin leakage in rat mesentery. This study aimed to investigate whether Yiqifumai injection attenuated cerebral microvascular hyperpermeability and corresponding contribution of its main ingredients. Methods Rats were challenged by lipopolysaccharide infusion (5 mg/kg/h) for 90 minutes. Yiqifumai injection (160 mg/kg/h), Rb1 (5 mg/kg/h), Sch (2.5 mg/kg/h), and Rb1 (5 mg/kg/h) + Sch (2.5 mg/kg/h) were infused 30 minutes before (pretreatment) or after (post-treatment) lipopolysaccharide administration. Results Both pretreatment and post-treatment with Yiqifumai injection attenuated cerebral venular albumin leakage during lipopolysaccharide infusion and cerebrovascular hyperpermeability at 72 hours after lipopolysaccharide infusion. Yiqifumai injection restrained the decreased junction protein expression, adenosine triphosphate content, and mitochondria complex I, II, IV, and V activities. Moreover, Yiqifumai injection inhibited toll-like receptor-4 expression, Src phosphorylation, and caveolin-1 expression. Its main ingredients Rb1 and Sch alone worked differently, with Rb1 being more effective for enhancing energy metabolism, while Sch attenuating toll-like receptor-4 expression and Src activation. Conclusion Yiqifumai injection exerts a protective and ameliorated effect on cerebral microvascular hyperpermeability, which is more effective than any of its ingredients, possibly due to the interaction of its main ingredients through a multi-pathway mode.

AB  - The association of bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Treponema denticola, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans among others with periodontal disease offers the opportunity for the development of diagnostic tests that are based upon the detection and/or quantification of one or more of these organisms or their by-products in the plaque. Three of the putative periodontal pathogens namely, T. denticola, B. gingivalis, and B. forsythus, can hydrolyze the synthetic trypsin substrate, N-benzoyl-DL-arginine-2-naphthylamide (BANA) forming a color reaction. The present investigation evaluated a commercially developed solid state assay for BANA hydrolysis that can be read after 15 minutes incubation at chairside. A total of 702 subgingival plaque samples were collected from 117 patients seen at four university dental clinics and placed on reagent cards. The color development on the cards was compared to the presence of T. denticola and B. gingivalis in the plaque, and with the clinical appearance of the sampled sites. This multi-center study demonstrated that antibodies to B. gingivalis and T. denticola could detect these organisms by an ELISA in the majority of the subgingival plaque samples. Comparable information could be obtained when the same plaques were evaluated by the reagent card format for BANA hydrolysis. The ELISA and reagent card were comparable in their ability to distinguish between clinically healthy and diseased sites. Both diagnostic procedures detected the periodontopathogens in plaques from sites that were judged clinically healthy. The reagent card test has certain clinical advantages over the ELISA in that it is simple, can be performed quickly at chairside, and provides valuable information as to the pathogenicity of the microflora at discrete oral sites. Such information may be used in the detection of patients or intraoral sites at risk for periodontal disease. J Periodontol 1990;61:189-196.

AB  - Bone degenerative diseases are on the increase globally and are often problematic to treat. This has led to a demand to identify supplements that aid bone growth and formation. Aquamin is a natural multi-mineral food supplement, derived from the red algae Lithothamnion species which contains calcium, magnesium and 72 other trace minerals. It has been previously reported to increase bone formation and mineralisation. This study aimed to investigate the 28 day in vitro osteogenic response of Aquamin supplemented with Vitamin D. The osteogenic potential of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells was analysed in standard osteogenic medium supplemented with Aquamin +/? Vitamin D3, and the controls consisted of osteogenic medium, +/? Vitamin D3. Proliferation of osteoblasts, metabolic activity and cell viability did not differ between Aquamin and the osteogenic control groups. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and mineralisation were increased by the supplementation of Aquamin, and the addition of Vitamin D3 increased mineralisation for all groups. The combination of Aquamin and Vitamin D3 yielded a significant increase in ALP and mineralisation over Aquamin alone and the standard osteogenic control +/? Vitamin D3. This study demonstrates that Aquamin aids osteogenesis, and that its osteogenic response can be enhanced by combining Aquamin with Vitamin D3. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Bone grafts are an important part of orthopaedic surgeon's armamentarium. Despite well-established bone-grafting techniques, large bone defects still represent a challenge. Efforts have therefore been made to develop osteoconductive, osteoinductive, and osteogenic bone-replacement systems. The long-term clinical goal in bone tissue engineering is to reconstruct bony tissue in an anatomically functional three-dimensional morphology. Current bone tissue engineering strategies take into account that bone is known for its ability to regenerate following injury, and for its intrinsic capability to re-establish a complex hierarchical structure during regeneration. Although the tissue engineering of bone for the reconstruction of small to moderate sized bone defects technically feasible, the reconstruction of large defects remains a daunting challenge. The essential steps towards optimized clinical application of tissue-engineered bone are dependent upon recent advances in the area of neovascularization of the engineered construct. Despite these recent advances, however, a gap from bench to bedside remains; this may ultimately be bridged by a closer collaboration between basic scientists and reconstructive surgeons. The aim of this review is to introduce the basic principles of tissue engineering of bone, outline the relevant bone physiology, and discuss the recent concepts for the induction of vascularization in engineered bone tissue. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Fusarium circinatum causes pitch canker disease in a wide range of pine trees, including Pinus radiata, with devastating economic consequences. To assess the spatial and temporal dynamics of growth of this pathogen in radiata pine, we examined the process of infection using both real-time PCR to quantify fungal biomass inside the plant host, and confocal microscopy using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged strain of F. circinatum. Pathogen growth exhibited three distinct phases: an initial exponential increase in fungal biomass, concomitant with pathogen colonization of the cortex and phloem; a slowdown in fungal growth coincident with sporulating hyphae deep within the host; and stabilization of the fungal biomass when the first wilting symptoms appeared. The number of resin ducts in the xylem was found to increase in response to infection and the fungus grew inside both constitutive and traumatic resin ducts. These results indicate that conidiation may contribute to the spatial or temporal dissemination of the pathogen. Moreover, the present findings raise the intriguing possibility that the generation of traumatic resin ducts may be of more benefit to the fungus than to the plant.
