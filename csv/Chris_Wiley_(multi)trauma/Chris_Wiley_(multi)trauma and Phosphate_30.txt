AB  - Abstract Plant natural products derived from phenylalanine and the phenylpropanoid pathway are impressive in their chemical diversity and are the result of plant evolution, which has selected for the acquisition of large repertoires of pigments, structural and defensive compounds, all derived from a phenylpropanoid backbone via the plant-specific phenylpropanoid pathway. These compounds are important in plant growth, development and responses to environmental stresses and thus can have large impacts on agricultural productivity. While plant-based medicines containing phenylpropanoid-derived active components have long been used by humans, the benefits of specific flavonoids and other phenylpropanoid-derived compounds to human health and their potential for long-term health benefits have been only recognized more recently. In this part of the review, we discuss the diversity and biosynthetic origins of phenylpropanoids and particularly of the flavonoid and stilbenoid natural products. We then review data pertaining to the modes of action and biological properties of these compounds, referring on their effects on human health and physiology and their roles as plant defense and antimicrobial compounds. This review continues in Part II discussing the use of biotechnological tools targeting the rational reconstruction of multienzyme pathways in order to modify the production of such compounds in plants and model microbial systems for the benefit of agriculture and forestry.

AB  - Abstract BACKGROUND The extent of enzymatic proteolysis mainly depends on accessibility of the peptide bonds, which stabilize the protein structure. The high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) process is able to induce, at certain operating conditions, protein displacement, thus suggesting that this technology can be used to modify protein resistance to the enzymatic attack. This work aims at investigating the mechanism of enzymatic hydrolysis assisted by HHP performed under different processing conditions (pressure level, treatment time). Bovine serum albumin was selected for the experiments, solubilized in sodium phosphate buffer (25 mg mL?1, pH 7.5) with α-chymotrypsin or trypsin (E/S ratio?=?1/10) and HPP treatment (100?500 MPa, 15?25 min). RESULTS HHP treatment enhanced the extent of the hydrolysis reaction of globular proteins, being more effective than conventional hydrolysis. At HHP treatment conditions maximizing the protein unfolding, the hydrolysis degree of proteins was increased as a consequence of the increased exposure of peptide bonds to the attack of proteolytic enzymes. The maximum hydrolysis degree (10% and 7% respectively for the samples hydrolyzed with α-chymotrypsin and trypsin) was observed for the samples processed at 400 MPa for 25 min. At pressure levels higher than 400 MPa the formation of aggregates was likely to occur; thus the degree of hydrolysis decreased. CONCLUSION Protein unfolding represents the key factor controlling the efficiency of HHP-assisted hydrolysis treatments. The peptide produced under high pressure showed lower dimensions and a different structure with respect to those of the hydrolysates obtained when the hydrolysis was carried out at atmospheric pressure, thus opening new frontiers of application in food science and nutrition. ? 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that combined intracavernosal injection with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with adeno-associated virus-mediated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (AAV-BDNF) synergistically facilitates the neural regeneration and erectile function after cavernosal nerve injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly divided into five equal groups: eight had a sham operation while 32 had bilateral cavernosal nerve freezing followed by an immediate intracavernosal injection with either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), VEGF, AAV-BDNF, or AAV-BDNF?+?VEGF. Erectile function was assessed by cavernosal nerve electrostimulation at 3?months, and samples of the major pelvic ganglia and penile tissue were evaluated histologically. RESULTS In this animal model of impotence from nerve injury, the recovery of erectile function was greatest in those receiving AAV-BDNF?+?VEGF; the mean (sd) maximal intracavernosal pressure in this group was 87.2?(20.78)?cmH2O, compared with 37.3?(11.39) for VEGF alone and 49.8?(29.58) for AAV-BDNF alone. No erectile dysfunction was identified in the sham group, with a pressure of 100.7?(22.70)?cmH2O, while all treatment groups significantly outperformed the PBS (control) group, at 29.3?(13.52)?cmH2O. Furthermore, all animals receiving monotherapy or combined treatment had more NADPH-diaphorase-positive nerve fibres than controls but less than in the sham group. CONCLUSION Bilateral cavernosal nerve freezing causes erectile dysfunction with accompanying neurological changes. Intracavernosal injection with either VEGF or AAV-BDNF alone enhances nerve regeneration, with combined therapy (VEGF and AAV-BDNF) promoting neural and erectile recovery additively.

AB  - Summary What is known and Objective:? Studies have shown that comprehensive interventions by pharmacists can improve adherence and persistence to osteoporosis therapy, but the association between adherence and bone turnover markers (BTMs) has never been studied. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of pharmaceutical care on medication adherence (and its effects on BTMs), as well as persistence of postmenopausal osteoporotic women to prescribed bisphosphonates. Methods:? A randomized controlled trial was conducted from 2005 to 2009 in the University Malaya Medical Centre, Malaysia. Inclusion criteria: postmenopausal osteoporotic women diagnosed with osteoporosis with a T-score≤?2·5 or who had a low-trauma fracture and prescribed weekly alendronate/risedronate. Intervention participants received counselling on osteoporosis, risk factors, lifestyle modifications, goals of therapy, side effects and the importance of adherence. Adherence was assessed at months 3, 6 and 12, and persistence at month 12. Feedback on BTMs was provided at months 4 and 7. The control group received no counselling. Two BTMs were used: serum C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I) and serum osteocalcin (OC). Main outcomes measured: medication adherence, BTMs and persistence. Results and Discussion:? Intervention participants who received pharmaceutical care reported significantly higher medication adherence at 6 (P?=?0·015) and 12?months (P?=?0·047) compared with the control group; but this effect was not shown by the BTMs. This is probably due to the long effect of bisphosphonates in bone. A significant difference was found between serum CTX-I and OC in identifying non-responders to anti-resorptive therapy (P?<?0·001), indicating the usefulness of BTMs as an objective marker. However, pharmaceutical care did not affect persistence to osteoporosis therapy within a 1-year period [log rank (Mantel?Cox) ?2?=?0·496, P?= 0·481]. The proportion of participants who were persistent with bisphosphonate therapy after 12?months was 89·8% and 87·0% in the control and intervention group respectively. What is new and Conclusion:? The provision of pharmaceutical care improved medication adherence but not persistence. BTMs were not appropriate objective measures for assessing adherence to weekly bisphosphonates but were useful for identifying non-responders to treatment within 3?6?months, much earlier than using bone mineral density. The study indicates that pharmacists have a role in improving medication adherence, but its long-term effect on persistence warrants further studies with longer duration.

AB  - Abstract Some nuclear-encoded proteins are imported into higher plant plastids via the endomembrane (EM) system. Compared with multi-protein Toc and Tic translocons required for most plastid protein import, the relatively uncomplicated nature of EM trafficking led to suggestions that it was the original transport mechanism for nuclear-encoded endosymbiont proteins, and critical for the early stages of plastid evolution. Its apparent simplicity disappears, however, when EM transport is considered in light of selective constraints likely encountered during the conversion of stable endosymbionts into fully integrated organelles. From this perspective it is more parsimonious to presume the early evolution of post-translational protein import via simpler, ancestral forms of modern Toc and Tic plastid translocons, with EM trafficking arising later to accommodate glycosylation and/or protein targeting to multiple cellular locations. This hypothesis is supported by both empirical and comparative data, and is consistent with the relative paucity of EM-based transport to modern primary plastids.

AB  - Abstract Torpor during hibernation defines the nadir of mammalian metabolism where whole animal rates of metabolism are decreased to as low as 2% of basal metabolic rate. This capacity to decrease profoundly the metabolic demand of organs and tissues has the potential to translate into novel therapies for the treatment of ischemia associated with stroke, cardiac arrest or trauma where delivery of oxygen and nutrients fails to meet demand. If metabolic demand could be arrested in a regulated way, cell and tissue injury could be attenuated. Metabolic suppression achieved during hibernation is regulated, in part, by the central nervous system through indirect and possibly direct means. In this study, we review recent evidence for mechanisms of central nervous system control of torpor in hibernating rodents including evidence of a permissive, hibernation protein complex, a role for A1 adenosine receptors, mu opiate receptors, glutamate and thyrotropin-releasing hormone. Central sites for regulation of torpor include the hippocampus, hypothalamus and nuclei of the autonomic nervous system. In addition, we discuss evidence that hibernation phenotypes can be translated to non-hibernating species by H2S and 3-iodothyronamine with the caveat that the hypothermia, bradycardia, and metabolic suppression induced by these compounds may or may not be identical to mechanisms employed in true hibernation.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides the interventional oncology (IO) clinician with the basics of veterinary oncology in regards to the current tumor staging systems for relevant tumors. The most common staging system is the World Health Organization (WHO) TNM staging system. Specifically this is based on the size and/or extent of the primary tumor (T), presence or absence of lymph node involvement (N), and whether metastasis (M), has occurred. The chapter presents an understanding of the chemotherapy basics, including commonly used drugs, proper administration, disposal, toxicities and their associated grading schemes, and the basics of radiation therapy (RT). RT may be used in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting, as well as a single modality or concurrently to chemotherapy. The chapter also provides an introduction to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and their expanding use in veterinary medicine, and standard criteria for defining responses in an effort to further standardize studies that evaluate cancer therapies.

AB  - Summary Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid covalently bound in esterified form in the cell membranes of most body cells. Following irritation or injury, arachidonic acid is released and oxygenated by enzyme systems leading to the formation of an important group of inflammatory mediators, the eicosanoids. It is now recognised that eicosanoid release is fundamental to the inflammatory process. For example, the prostaglandins and other prostanoids, products of the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme pathway, have potent inflammatory properties and prostaglandin E2 is readily detectable in equine acute inflammatory exudates. The administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs results in inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and this explains the mode of action of agents such as phenylbutazone and flunixin. Lipoxygenase enzymes metabolise arachidonic acid to a group of non-cyclised eicosanoids, the leukotrienes, some of which are also important inflammatory mediators. They are probably of particular importance in leucocyte-mediated aspects of chronic inflammation. Currently available non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, however, do not inhibit lipoxygenase activity. In the light of recent evidence, the inflammatory process is re-examined and the important emerging roles of both cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase derived eicosanoids are explored. The mode of action of current and future antiinflammatory drugs offered to the equine clinician can be explained by their interference with arachidonic acid metabolism.

AB  - Abstract Colon cancer is one of the most common malignancies among populations in the United States and Western Europe, and one of the leading causes of worldwide morbidity and mortality due to cancer. The early detection of colon cancer is central to the effective treatment of this disease and early detection markers are needed. We have demonstrated that high-resolution two-dimensional gel analysis of nuclear matrix proteins (NMPs) demonstrated a specific oncological fingerprint of colon cancer. Utilizing this approach, four proteins specific for colon cancer was identified. Additionally, one protein was expressed much more strongly in colon cancer compared to adjacent and normal donor tissue. The amino acid composition of this protein revealed sequence similarity with calreticulin. The multi-functional protein, calreticulin, is normally found in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum although some reports have described a nuclear localization of the protein. The aim of this study was to confirm the identity of the protein as calreticulin as well as to evaluate the localization of calreticulin in the nuclear matrix of colon cancer tissue. J. Cell.

AB  - Abstract Background Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) have an increased risk of neurological complications, particularly stroke and silent cerebral infarction (SCI). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a nerve growth factor associated with neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, elevated transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities and increased risk of stroke in patients with SCD. The objective of this study was to analyze plasma BDNF protein levels in children with SCD participating in the Silent Cerebral Infarct Transfusion Multi-Center Clinical Trial (SIT Trial), comparing plasma samples of children with SCD and SCI to plasma samples from children with SCD without SCI, as well as healthy pediatric control participants. Procedure Entry, exit, and longitudinal blood samples were collected from 190 SIT Trial participants with SCD and healthy pediatric controls over time. BDNF levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Sample collection was not optimized for measurements of BDNF, but factors affecting BDNF levels were accounted for in analyses. Results BDNF levels were significantly higher in children with SCD in comparison to healthy pediatric control subjects. BDNF levels significantly increased over time in SCD participants. BDNF levels did not show any significant associations with the presence or absence of SCI or new/progressive SCI/stroke or TCD velocities. Conclusions Plasma BDNF levels are elevated and increase over time in children with SCD. Additional studies with more longitudinal samples are needed to address the reasons for those increased levels.

AB  - Abstract Retinal degeneration (RD) results in photoreceptor loss and irreversible visual impairments. This study sought to alleviate the photoreceptor degeneration via the adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated erythropoietin (EPO) therapy. AAV-2/2-mCMV-EPO vectors were constructed and delivered into the subretinal space of a RD model. The retinal morphology, optokinetic behaviour and electrophysiological function of the treated animals were analysed. The subretinal delivery of AAV-2/2 vectors induced robust EPO gene expressions in the retinas. AAV2/2-mediated EPO therapy ameliorated the photoreceptor degeneration and visual impairments of the RD animal model. Furthermore, the multi-electrodes array (MEA) was used to detect the firing activities of retinal ganglion cells. MEA recording showed that the EPO therapy could restrain the spontaneous firing response, enhance the light-induced firing response and preserve the basic configurations of visual signal pathway in RD model. Our MEA assay provided an example to evaluate the potency of pharmacological compounds on retinal plasticity. In conclusion, AAV2/2-mediated EPO therapy can ameliorate the photoreceptor degeneration and rectify the abnormities in visual signal transmission. These beneficial results suggest the AAV vector is a viable therapeutic option for retinopathies with rapidly degenerating kinetics and lay the groundwork for future development of EPO gene therapy.

AB  - The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used for expressing the genes encoding the ionotropic N-methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits from rats (NR1a, NR2A, NR2C) and mice (NR2B). Four plasmids were constructed by cloning the different NMDA receptor genes in the two multi-copy yeast-Escherichia coli shuttle vectors pMB01 (?NR1a gene) and pMB02 (?NR2A-2C genes). The protease-deficient S. cerevisiae strain cI3-ABYS-86 (leu?, ura?) was transformed or co-transformed with the resulting plasmids pMBNR1a (leu+) or pMBNR1a/pMBNR2A?C (ura+) respectively. Western blotting analysis with antibodies raised against amino acid sequences at the C-termini of the respective subunits revealed that the recombinant receptor proteins were differently expressed and only partially glycosylated in the cell membranes of the recombinant yeast strains. The expression and localization of the recombinant NMDA receptor proteins were also proved by immunofluorescence microscopy which indicated a distinct expression of the different NMDA receptor subunits in the plasma membrane of the transformed yeast cells. Pharmacological characterization of crude membrane preparations of the recombinant yeast cells showed saturable binding of the glycine antagonist [3H]MDL105,519 with Kd values of 56.9?±?6.19?nM (NR1a/NR2A), 26.72?±?2.13?nM (NR1a/NR2B), and 21.22?±?1.64?nM (NR1a/NR2C), and bound capacities of 17.94?±?1.24?pmol/mg membrane protein (NR1a/NR2A), 11.45?±?0.67?pmol/mg (NR1a/NR2B), and 16.15?±?0.86 (NR1a/NR2C) pmol/mg. The [3H]MDL105,519 binding was inhibited by the glycine antagonist 5,7-dichlorokynurenate, ethyl-2-carboxy-4,6-dichloro-3-indoleacetate, and itself, but not by glycine, D-serine or 1-amino-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid. Specific binding of [3H]glycine or the NMDA channel blocker [3H]dizolcipine were not observed.

AB  - Abstract Stroke is a multi-factorial polygenic disease and is a major cause of death and adult disability. Administration of bone marrow stem cells protects ischemic rat brain by facilitating recovery of neurological functions. But the molecular mechanism of stem cells action and their effect on gene expression is not well explored. In this study, we have transplanted 1 ? 106 human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMMSCs) in middle cerebral artery occluded (MCAo) adult male Wistar rats through intracarotid artery route at 24 h after surgery. Motor behavioral tests (rotarod and open field) were performed to assess the changes in motor functions at day 0 and day1, 4, 8 and 14. The expression of studied genes at mRNA and protein level was quantified by using Q-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Further, we have assessed the methylation pattern of promoter of these genes by using methylation-specific PCR. Data were analyzed statistically and correlated. A significant improvement in behavioral deficits was observed in stem cells treated group after 14th day post stroke. Significantly (p < 0.05) increased mRNA and protein levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor and ANP genes in hBMMSCs treated group along with decrease in methylation level at their promoter was observed. On the other hand, significantly decreased mRNA and protein level of TSP1 and WNK1 in hBMMSCs treated group was observed. In conclusion, hBMMSCs administration significantly improves the behavioral deficits by improving motor and locomotor coordination. The promoter of TSP1 and WNK1 genes was found to be hyper-methylated in hBMMSCs group resulting in their decreased expression while the promoter of ANP and brain derived neurotrophic factor was found to be hypo-methylated. This study might shed a light on how hBMMSCs affect the gene expression by modulating methylation status.

AB  - Aim: Multi-center's clinical study for the application of the cultured dermal substitute (CDS) composed of hyaluronic acid and collagen spongy matrix with allogenic cultured fibroblasts1 is in progress since 2001. In this study, effect of the CDS for the treatment of fresh DDB wounds was tested. Methods: Six cases of second-degree burns, diagnosed as DDB by observation of blood stream of the dermal capillary using Compact Micro Vision System (Hi-Scope?, Hi Rox Co., Japan), were treated with the cultured allogenic fibroblasts, CDS. Results: The epithelialization of the wounds was obtained on 8.2?±?2.6 (mean?±?SD) days after the application. Conclusion: The results of our clinical experiences suggest that the allogenic cultured fibroblasts have beneficial effect on the wound healing of the DDB.

AB  - ABSTRACT The pathological features of 30 cases of canine rheumatoid arthritis are described. The principle pathological feature is a chronic symmetrical polysynovitis. The pathological features of the joints varied in severity. The synovial membrane generally showed villous hypertrophy with aggregates of lymphocytes and plasma cells. Destruction of articular cartilage and bone occurred in association with a replacement granulation tissue which often produced a pannus over the articular surface. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated complexes of IgG or IgM with C3 in synovial lining cells, macrophages, blood vessel walls and free in the extracellular tissues. IgG and IgM producing plasma cells were also common. Fibrinogen deposits were extensive. The immunofluorescence findings were non-specific but support the concept of an immune complex mediated inflammation within the joints. Investigations for bacterial, mycoplasmal and viral infections of the joints were negative.

AB  - In accordance with recent terminology, it is proposed that malignant mesenchymoma should be renamed ?composite sarcoma? and defined as ?a sarcoma composed of two or more cellular types each of which is sufficiently differentiated to permit clear recognition of its histogenetic type microscopically, immunohistochemically or ultrastructurally; excluding fibrosarcomatous and high-grade pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcomatous component, dedifferentiated sarcoma and the combination of osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma which is regarded as a single histogenetic type?. Four cases of primary osseous composite sarcoma (POCS) were identified among 928 primary bone sarcomas. Their age ranged from 10 to 87 years, peak incidence in the second decade with equal sex distribution. Most presented with pain, commonest in the knee, affecting the metaphysis, appearing radiologically as expansile infiltrative osteolytic lesions with cortical erosion, periosteal reaction, variable extent of osteoblastic areas and soft tissue extension. All contained variable amounts of conventional high-grade osteosarcoma with or without chondrosarcoma component; the other constituents were liposarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and leiomyosarcoma. In all cases, Ki67 proliferative index was over 35%, there was no CDK4 and MDM2 amplification. The absence of low-grade component supported the de novo origin of POCS rather than derivation from divergent dedifferentiation. The two older patients with hitherto undescribed osteoleiomyosarcoma died 2 and 10 months after operation, whereas the two younger with osteorhabdomyosarcoma and osteoliposarcoma enjoyed disease-free survival at 16 and 6 years after chemotherapy despite the latter showing lung metastasis at presentation. Identification of the different lines of differentiation together with their approximate amounts and histological grades is therefore mandatory for POCS as multi-agent chemotherapy catered for each sarcoma component might offer hope for long-term disease-free survival.

AB  - Abstract The most common errors in the diagnosis of dementia are underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis. Underdiagnosis is best avoided by careful use of psychometric screening tests to detect cognitive impairment in patients unaware of their own defect. Overdiagnosis can be avoided by not applying the label of ?dementia? until the diagnosis is unequivocal. Complete evaluation is necessary to rule out treatable causes of dementia, and should include medical, neurological, and psychiatric history and examination, simple psychometric tests, laboratory battery, computerized transaxial tomographic brain scan, and electroencephalogram. Ultimately, the diagnosis of dementia may change at follow-up examination, and the unequivocal diagnosis of a specific form of dementia still requires autopsy and neuropathological examination of the brain. The most common causes of cognitive impairment in the elderly include Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, depression, and other specific illnesses such as tumors, Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease, and normal pressure hydrocephalus. Even systemic disease can present as dementia. The evaluation outlined above may help distinguish among these causes. New diagnostic techniques may eventually be helpful as well.

AB  - ABSTRACT The occurrence of a liposarcoma in a Greyhound is reported. The dog was presented with a swollen left hock which, on radiographic examination, was shown to be a tumour in the bone. Metastasis from the primary site or independent genesis led to the involvement of the metaphyseal areas of the long bones, the left caudal lumbar lymph node, the liver and the spleen. The neoplastic tissue was composed of cells ranging from undifferentiated sarcoma cells to well-differentiated vacuolated fat cells. Résumé. On rapporte l'occurrence d'un liposarcome chez un lévrier. Le chien s'était présenté avec le jarret gauche enflé, ce qui, d'après un examen radiographique, s'était révélé être une tumeur de l'os. La métastase du site primaire ou de genèse indépendante a mené à l'implication des régions métaphysiques des os longs, du n?ud lymphatique lombaire caudal de gauche, du foie er de la rate. Les tissus néoplastiques étaient composés de cellules variant de cellules de sarcome non-différenciées à des cellules bien différenciées de graisse vacuolaire. Zusammenfassung. Das Vorkommen von einem Liposarkom wurde in einem Windhund berichtet. Der Hund litt an einem geschwollenen linken Fesselgelenk, welches sich bei Rönt-genuntersuchung ais ein Tumor im Knochen erwies. Metastase von der primären Stelle oder un-abhängigen Entstehung führte zu der Verwicklung von den metaphysischen Gebieten der langen Knochen, des linken kaudalen lumbalen Lymphknoten, der Leber und der Milz. Die neoplastischen Gewebe waren aus Zellen zusammengesetzt, die sich von nichtdifferenzierten Sarkomzellen zu gut differenzierten vakuolen Fettzellen erstreckten.
