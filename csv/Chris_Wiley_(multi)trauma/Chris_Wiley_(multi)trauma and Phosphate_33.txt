AB  - Summary Portal vascular anomalies (PVAs) in dogs and cats include congenital or acquired macrovascular portosystemic shunts (PSS), portal venous hypoplasia (microvascular dysplasia), hepatic arteriovenous malformation, and noncirrhotic portal hypertension with portal vein atresia. Congenital portosystemic shunts (CPSS) are the most common PVA managed surgically. Cats with CPSS are generally considered to have a higher complication rate and poorer outcome than dogs. Hypothermia is reported as an early predictor of postoperative death in toy breeds. Systemic hypotension is a common problem during anesthesia and surgery for CPSS and is often multifactorial. Hypoglycemia occurs commonly in dogs with CPSS, particularly small breeds. Intraoperative bleeding is most commonly considered a complication of surgery for IHPSS, although the specific incidence of intraoperative hemorrhage in CPSS surgery is rarely reported. Hypoalbuminemia is a common biochemical abnormality in dogs with CPSS but is rarely reported in cats with CPSS. Status epilepticus is a devastating complication of surgery for CPSS.

AB  - The biochemical, haemodynamic, clinical, and nutritional benefits of nocturnal haemodialysis (NHD) compared with (c/w) 4?hr, 3/week conventional haemodialysis (CHD) are well known and accrue by increasing dialysis time and frequency either for 8?hrs alternate night/week (NHD3.5) or for 8?hrs 6 nights/week NHD (NHD6). However, there is little data yet comparing NHD3.5 with NHD6. 13 NHD6(8.15?hrs/night) were c/w 14 NHD3.5(7.8?hrs/night), all with similar demographic profiles. NHD6 had unrestricted diet and fluid intake but NHD3.5 needed some restriction. Before (b) and after (a) HD phosphate (PO4) control was ideal though bPO4 levels for NHD6 were lower (1.64?mmol/l) c/w NHD3.5(1.83?mmol/l). All NHD6 needed PO4 supplementation c/w 2/14 NHD3.5 but 5/14 NHD3.5 needed PO4 binders c/w 0/13 NHD6. Both had normal blood pressures with 3/14 NHD3.5 needing anti-hypertensives c/w 2/13 NHD6. The bHb was 122.8?g/l (NHD6) c/w 127.7?g/l (NHD3.5) and the balbumin was 38.3?g/l (NHD6) c/w 37.7?g/l (NHD3.5). NHD6 had lower b blood urea (10.2 c/w 19.5?mmol/l) and less interdialytic urea and creatinine fluctuation. NHD6 ultrafiltration rates (UFR) and intradialytic weight gains (mean?±?SEM) were significantly lower (248?±?22.7?ml/hr and 2.03?±?0.19?kg) c/w NHD3.5(453?±?34.6?ml/hr and 2.85?±?0.27?kg): UFR p?<?0.10. We conclude that NHD6 offers the optimum biochemical, volume, and clinical outcome but NHD3.5 still has a clear and major advantage over CHD and a dual additional appeal to providers seeking home-based therapy cost advantages and consumable expenditure control. A flexible dialysis program should offer all the time and frequency options of NHD but, in particular, should support NHD at a frequency sympathetic to the clinical, rehabilitation, and lifestyle aspirations of individual patients.

AB  - An increased frequency of the Milk-Alkali syndrome in the last several years has been noticed related to increasing use of calcium carbonate as a phosphate binder in CKD patients, as an antacid or as calcium supplementation. We present a case of severe hypercalcemia secondary to Milk-Alkali syndrome that precipitated acute renal failure requiring urgent hemodialysis. A 59-year-old male with history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and acid reflux presented to the ER with confusion, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. His family relayed a history of recent indigestion and relief with Tums. He was taking several tablets at short intervals to self-treat the indigestion. At the time of presentation, patient was confused and noted to be dehydrated. Lab findings were significant for elevated BUN/Cr- 121?mg/dl/11.1?mg/dl (baseline Cr 1.1?mg/dl few months ago), bicarbonate 38?mg/dl, calcium 16.7?mg/dl, ionized Ca of 1.76?mmol/L, iPTH 10?pg/ml, PTHrP 0.7?pg/ml. Medical management with intravenous fluids and furosemide showed no improvement in renal failure, or calcium level. Patient was then started on hemodialysis with 2.0?mmol/L calcium in the dialysate the next day. There was gradual improvement in patient's mental status, calcium values, and renal failure over the ensuing 2 weeks. Discussion and Conclusions:? The diagnosis of Milk-Alkali syndrome is made on the basis of history. Metabolic abnormalities involved in this syndrome are hypercalcemia with low to normal PTH and Vit. D levels, renal failure, and metabolic alkalosis. Failed medical management required acute dialysis in this patient. Acute hemodialysis in such a case could be life saving. Due to increasing use of calcium carbonate for dyspepsia and osteoporosis, patients should be made aware of these severe, potentially life-threatening adverse effects.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Sporadic measurement of serum triglycerides in depressed and inappetant clinically ill horses revealed severe hypertriglyceridaemia without visible evidence of lipaemia on several occasions, leading to the inclusion of serum triglyceride concentrations in the routine serum biochemistry evaluation of our hospital. Since then, more cases have been identified and treated for hypertriglyceridaemia, raising questions about the prevalence, predisposing factors and significance of these findings. Hypotheses: 1) Severe hypertriglyceridaemia without visible opacity of the serum occurs more commonly in clinically ill and inappetant horses than previously described and 2) appropriate treatment using i.v. dextrose and/or partial parenteral nutrition would decrease serum triglycerides to normal limits and might result in improved appetite and attitude of the patient. Methods: The laboratory computer database from 2000 and 2001 was searched for increased serum triglycerides (>5.65 mmol/l) in any horse breed, ponies and miniature breeds excluded. Data analysed included subject details, diagnosis, clinical and laboratory parameters, treatment, response to treatment and outcome. Results: Severe hypertriglyceridaemia was identified in 13 horses, with serum triglyceride concentrations 6.17?18.29 mmol/l, while none showed visible lipaemia. All horses had clinical and laboratory findings consistent with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and all but one had an increased serum creatinine concentration. Treatment with i.v. dextrose and/or partial parenteral nutrition resulted in decrease of the serum triglycerides to normal limits. Conclusions: Severe hypertriglyceridaemia occurs in inappetant and clinically ill horses without evidence of serum opacity more commonly than previously described. The presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome might predispose horses to hypertriglyceridaemia, while the increased creatinine concentration might be a predisposing factor or result of the condition. Horses identified in our study readily responded to treatment and appetite and attitude improved coincident with decrease of the serum triglycerides to normal limits. Potential relevance: Hypertriglyceridaemia could perpetuate inappetance and depression in clinically ill horses and potentially predispose to fatty infiltration of the liver and other organ systems.

AB  - In end-stage renal failure, impaired renal catabolism leads to retention of beta 2 microglobulin (ß2M), identified as the major constituent of hemodialysis (HD) related amyloidosis. It has been previously shown that, while using a high flux (HF) HD membrane, nocturnal hemodialysis (NHD) with its increased time and frequency provides a much higher clearance of ß2M compared to conventional HD. We compared serum ß2M levels between low flux (LF) and HF in a group of 9 NHD patients who dialyse 8 hours 6 nights/week. Fresenius polysulfone LF membrane size F6-F8 HPS dialyser were used for the first 15 months (mth) of NHD (SA 1.3?1.8?m2). Subsequently, polysulfone HF FX80 dialyzer were used (SA 1.8?m2). Blood flow and dialysate flow rates were unchanged throughout the study. ß2M levels were measured at 6, 12, 15?mth on LF and at 6, 12?mth on HF. Albumin, homocysteine (Hcy), and phosphate (Phos) levels were also recorded at these times. ß2M levels trended upwards during the 15?mth on LF (36.6?±?10.57 at 6?mth vs 47.1?±?11.7 at 15?mth). On introduction of HF, there was a significant fall in ß2M at 6?mth to 12.4?±?3.5 (p?<?0.003), while ß2M levels were unchanged at 12?mth of HF. A downward trend in Hcy levels with the use of HF was noted (12.9?±?2.9 at 0?mth Vs 11.1?±?3.7 at 12?mth). Plasma albumin and Phos levels remained unchanged as did the use of Phos supplementation. Levels of ß2M continued to rise on NHD with LF, indicating inadequate clearance. With the introduction of HF there was a significant fall in ß2M levels consistent with improved clearance. The implications of this are that ß2M clearance may be time and frequency dependent only if dialyser membrane flux is adequate.

AB  - Harmful algae (HA) and their toxins present increasing obstacles to routine protein production in aquatic systems. Preventing, controlling, or mitigating harmful algal blooms (HAB) and cyanobacterial HAB (cyanoHAB) have become major foci for many geographic areas and systems of the world, from freshwater ponds to openocean fish cages, problems potentially exacerbated with continued anthropogenic loading and a changing climate selecting for some bloom-forming taxa. Worldwide, aquaculture production of aquatic food in inland waters exceeds that of marine waters, but use of the sea for fish and shellfish mariculture is rapidly increasing in many coastal oceans. Multi-step linear food webs have also been used, with fish, shellfish, phytoplankton, macroalgae, and abalone. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can test fish tissue for toxin content, generally in response to reported human illnesses or to identify whether newly identified toxins or other compounds might pose health risks to consumers.

AB  - Abstract Adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer according to stage of disease, present diagnostic and therapeutic advances, and the biology of the tumor is summarized: Stage I: The increasing number of small localized tumors occuring with earlier diagnosis motivates controlled clinical studies of irradiation of the breast with surgical axillary node status for exact biological classification. Encouraging results with local breast irradiation need confirmation in controlled studies. Improved survival by local interventions will most probably be due to selection of cases with earlier diagnosis rather than to variations in local therapies. Curative therapy saving the breast may be envisaged. Stage II: Systemic therapies with effect also on local-regional soft tissue disease necessitate rethinking on the role of radiotherapy in Stage II Disease. Preoperative irradiation trials are biologically not logical in patients who are strictly operable and with a high risk of occult dissemination at time of irradiation. Adjuvant half body or total body irradiation to very high risk Stage II patients may now be logical to explore in a controlled study. Identification of the very limited subgroup(s) of patients who will benefit from radiotherapy in Stage II is open for trials. The routine use of postoperative irradiation in strictly operable patients is highly questionable. In spite of a demonstrated decrease of local and regional recurrence and the psychological trauma of discovering a local growth, the following four facts weigh heavily against the routine use of post-operative radiotherapy: 1) Overtreatment: (a) less than 10% have local-regional recurrence without distant metastases. (b) in the approximately 25% who get local recurrences, a watch policy with later radiotherapy gives complete local control in 70%. 2) Increased morbidity: besides a local-regional morbidity an increased mortality (+ 1 to 10%) can be correlated with the use of radiotherapy in 8/10 randomized trials (p > 0.04). 3) Systemic therapies: the logical way to improve survival. Multiple drug chemotherapy has been shown to be most effective against soft tissue metastases. It can not be excluded that radiotherapy diminishes the effect of systemic therapies (chemo-hormone or immunotherapy). 4) Social-economic aspects: The patient's time and money, doctor's time and society's resources may be better used. Priorities are necessary even in oncology. The interaction of radiotherpy with systemic therapies needs clarification. Stage III: Radiotherapy has a clear therapeutic role in inoperable tumors limited to the breast. Its exact role in synergism with systemic therapies in a multiple modality approach still must be defined in controlled studies. An improved local therapeutic ratio ought to result from exploring advancements in radiotherapy using radiosensitizers, high energy particle radiation, interaction with chemotherapy, and hyperthermia. With increasingly efficient systemic therapies, local tumor control in Stage III may translate into increased survival. Stage IV: A palliative effect is well established. Controlled studies are lacking analyzing whether there is a cost-benefit-ratio that is advantageous when compared to other forms of therapy. The indicated positive effect of half body/total body irradiation is open for a controlled trial.

AB  - Summary Carbohydrate (CHO) stored in the form of skeletal muscle glycogen is the main energy source for glycolytic and oxidative ATP production during vigorous exercise in mammals. In man, horse and dog both short-term high intensity and prolonged submaximal exercise deplete muscle glycogen. In horses, however, muscle glycogen synthesis is 2?3-fold slower than in man and rat, even when a diet high in soluble CHO is fed. There appear to be significant differences in CHO and glycogen metabolism between horses and other mammals, and it is becoming increasingly clear that many conclusions drawn from human exercise physiology do not apply to horses. This review aims to provide a comprehensive, comparative summary of the research on muscle glycogen synthesis in horse, man and rodent. Species differences in CHO uptake and utilisation are examined and the issues with feeding high soluble CHO diets to horses are discussed. Alternative feeding strategies, including protein and long and short chain fatty acid supplementation and the importance of rehydration, are explored.

AB  - Research shows that low albumin is correlated with higher morbidity and mortality in the dialysis population. The reasons for this are multi-factorial and may be related to inadequate protein intake, infection and sepsis, inadequate dialysis, or catabolism of uremia. USRDS data show that ESRD Network 16 tends to have lower albumins compared to other ESRD Networks. Objective:? To evaluate albumin status of HD patients at Puget Sound Kidney Centers, Everett, WA (ESRD Network 16) and identify potential factors that may put patients at risk of hypoalbuminemia. Methods:? Clinical and biochemical data were collected for 3 months on 221 HD patients. Data included serum albumin (bromcresol purple), calcium, phosphorus, CO2, Hct, % saturation, ferritin, PTH, BUN, Kt/V, URR, nPCR, hours of HD treatment, interdialytic fluid weight gains, DW changes, incidence of infection and hospitalization, catheter use for dialysis access, presence of diabetes and other co-morbidities, dialyzer reuse, social/psychological status, and use of nutrition supplements. All biochemical data were collected after the longest interdialytic period and analyzed at the same reference laboratory. Data were averaged for each patient for the 3 months and correlations between parameters were determined using Chi-square analysis. Results:? 25% of all patients had albumins <3.2?g/dL (reference range for normal population 3.5?5.0?g/dL). Patients with lower albumins were significantly more likely to have DM (p?<?0.02), use catheters for HD access (p?<?0.001), had infections during the previous month (p?<?0.001), been hospitalized during the previous month (p?<?0.002), have co-morbid issues (p?<?0.001), and use nutrition supplements (p?<?0.002). No other factors were significantly correlated with lower albumin. Conclusion:? Factors other than nutrition seem to be related to hypoalbuminemia. This study has prompted improved protocols for catheter care and use, infection control, and early intervention for nutrition supplement use. Increased screening and monitoring at-risk patients (those with diabetes and other co-morbid conditions) has resulted in improved patient care.

AB  - ABSTRACT Feline dysautonomia is a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, the main features of which are dilated pupils, dry mucous membranes, mega-oesophagus and constipation. The clinical and pathological features, treatment and follow-up details of 40 cases seen at the University of Glasgow Veterinary School are described. The pathology was demonstrated to be mainly restricted to the autonomic ganglia and neurons in selected cranial nerve nuclei. Less marked changes were also found in neurons of the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia. Nine cases recovered but this required up to one year and, in some, mild clinical signs persisted. Viral, toxicological and epidemiological studies were unrewarding and the aetiology is presently unknown. The similarities between this condition, grass sickness of horses and dysautonomia in the dog and man are discussed.

AB  - This is the second annual revision of the Geriatrics Bibliography. Approximately two thirds of the old references have been replaced by more current or more detailed articles. The bibliography has been expanded to include several additional topics and over 200 new references. Since the literature pertinent to geriatrics is growing ever more rapidly, it has been necessary to omit many informative articles from the bibliography. Almost all of the references date from the past four years. Preference is given to recent publications, since they provide a list of the important earlier articles. Some articles were selected to highlight current controversies or changes in viewpoint. An occasional review article is cited to amplify geriatric aspects of common diseases. Most of the references deal specifically with an elderly patient population, studies of which, it will be noted, are confounded by questions of ?normal? aging as opposed to the concomitants of aging frequent in our society: inactivity, obesity, malnutrition, and psychosocial trauma. A few articles concern diseases remarkably common in the aged but for which no adequate study specifically from a geriatric viewpoint exists; e.g., monoclonal gammopathy, Paget's disease, pulmonary emboli. The references are divided into categories. The first (I) set deals with some possible causes of aging, the second (II) with physiologic decline accompanying aging, the third (III) with the atypical and nonspecific characteristics of illness among geriatric patients, and the fourth (IV) with non-physician services available to the elderly, including ethical quandaries. The remainder of the references are cited by pertinent medical specialty. Within each category, references are divided by disease process. Articles are further subgrouped by aspects of those diseases such as evaluation or therapy.

AB  - Abstract Purpose The aim of this article was to analyze the horizontal, vertical, and histological effects of alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) versus the ones of unassisted socket healing, in the format of an up-to-date review and meta-analysis. Materials and Methods An extensive electronic search in the electronic databases of the National Library of Medicine was conducted for articles published up to June 2014 to identify literature presenting data on the topic of ARP. Only randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, and prospective trials were included for meta-analysis. Results After screening 903 abstracts from the electronic database, we included 64 studies in qualitative and 18 in quantitative synthesis. Quality assessment characterized a medium risk of bias for the included literature. The meta-analysis showed a mean difference between test and control groups of approximately 1.31 to 1.54?mm in bucco-oral bone width and 0.91 to 1.12?mm in bone height. Additionally, the intergroup difference in percentage of vital bone was assessed to be inconclusive across the included studies. Implants could be inserted into the determined position without further augmentation in 90.1% of the experimental sites, while this was the case in only 79.2% of the control sockets. Conclusions Resorption of the alveolar ridge cannot be totally stopped by ARP, while it still can be prevented compared with unassisted healing. No reliable predictions on the histological effects could be made due to limited data. Further on, no recommendation for a specific technique of ARP could be made. In conclusion, there is still need for ongoing research on the topic, even though the lower percentage of implant sites that needed additional augmentation in test sockets seemed to bring a patient benefit.

AB  - Abstract Platelets modulate formation of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, but research with different preparations of platelets remains inconclusive. Here, we assessed whether serum components modulate the effect of platelet preparations. In murine bone marrow cultures, osteoclastogenesis was investigated in the presence of platelet-released supernatant (PRS), serum containing PRS (SC-PRS), and serum. Osteoclastogenesis was quantified by the numbers of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated cells, TRAP activity and resorption assays. Also human osteoclastogenesis assays were performed. Viability and proliferation were tested by MTT and 3[H]thymidine incorporation assays, respectively. Osteoblastogenesis was assessed by histochemical staining for alkaline phosphatase-of murine bone marrow cultures and human MG63 cells. We found PRS to increase the number of TRAP+ multinucleated cells in the early phase and TRAP activity in the later phase of osteoclastogenesis. SC-PRS and serum decreased the number and activity of TRAP+ multinucleated cells. Both serum containing preparations reduced viability and proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors. PRS decreased the numbers of alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies while SC-PRS and serum increased osteoblastmarkers in MG63. Proliferation of MG63 was stimulated by all preparations. These results show that activated platelets support osteoclastogenesis, while platelet preparations that contain serum components decrease osteoclastogenesis and increase osteoblastogenesis in vitro, suggesting that serum components modulate the effects of platelets on osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis. ? 2013 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Extended human longevity has resulted in increasing numbers of elderly persons in the general population. However, old age is also associated with a variety of serious physical disorders. Frailty among sedentary elderly patients is related to the impaired structure and function of contractile fibers. Biochemical research into cellular mechanisms that underlie sarcopenia promises to acquire the scientific basis of evidence to aid the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The recent application of MS-based proteomic methodology has identified a large cohort of disease-specific markers of sarcopenia. This review critically examines the biomedical implications of the results obtained from the proteomic screening of both aged human muscle and established animal models of sarcopenia. Substantial alterations in proteins involved in key metabolic pathways, regulatory and contractile elements of the actomyosin apparatus, myofibrillar remodeling and the cellular stress response are discussed. A multi-factorial etiology appears to be the basis for a slower-twitching aged fiber population, which exhibits a shift to more aerobic-oxidative metabolism. It is hoped that the detailed biomedical characterization of the newly identified biomarkers of sarcopenia will translate into better treatment options for reversing age-dependent muscle degeneration, which could improve the standard of living for a large portion of society.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To assess health and musculoskeletal function in survivors of pediatric sarcomas. Patients and Methods Thirty-two individuals treated for Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT), rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), or non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NR-STS) with multi-modality therapy were enrolled on this cross-sectional study. Median age at the time of therapy was 15.4 years (range 7.1?34.2), median age at the time of analysis was 37.4 years (17.5?55.4), and median duration of time elapsed from completion of therapy was 17.3 years (2.9?32.6). Participants underwent assessments of musculoskeletal functioning, cardiac function, metabolic and lipid analyses, renal and gonadal function, and psychological evaluation. Results This cohort of sarcoma survivors shows expected locoregional limitations in function of the area affected by sarcoma, and impaired global musculoskeletal functioning as evidenced by limited endurance and limited overall activity levels. The cohort also demonstrated substantial rates of cardiac dysfunction, elevated body fat index, hyperlipidemia, chronic psychological distress, and infertility in men (76%) and premature menopause (49%) in women. Conclusion Sarcoma survivors demonstrate diminished locoregional and global musculoskeletal functioning which likely limit occupational opportunities and socioeconomic health. In addition, the combination of diminished cardiac reserve, limited activity levels, and lipid dysregulation in sarcoma survivors suggests that this population is at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, even many years following completion of sarcoma therapy. Sarcoma survivors may benefit from life long follow-up for cardiovascular disease and from occupational counseling upon completion of therapy. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2007;48:192?199.

AB  - Background: Bone replacement grafts (BRG) are widely used in the treatment of periodontal osseous defects; however, the clinical benefits of this therapeutic practice require further clarification through a systematic review of randomized controlled studies. Rationale: The purpose of this systematic review is to access the efficacy of bone replacement grafts in proving demonstrable clinical improvements in periodontal osseous defects compared to surgical debridement alone. Focused Question: What is the effect of bone replacement grafts compared to other interventions on clinical, radiographic, adverse, and patient-centered outcomes in patients with periodontal osseous defects? Search Protocol: The computerized bibliographical databases MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from 1966 and 1974, respectively, to October 2002 for randomized controlled studies in which bone replacement grafts were compared to other surgical interventions in the treatment of periodontal osseous defects. The search strategy included screening of review articles and reference lists of retrieved articles as well as hand searches of selected journals. Inclusion criteria: All searches were limited to human studies in English language publications. Exclusion criteria: Non-randomized observational studies (e.g., case reports, case series), publications providing summary statistics without variance estimates or data to permit computation, and studies without BRG intervention alone were excluded. Data Collection and Analysis: The therapeutic endpoints examined included changes in bone level, clinical attachment level, probing depth, gingival recession, and crestal resorbtion. For purposes of meta-analysis, change in bone level (bone fill) was used as the primary outcome measure, measured upon surgical re-entry or transgingival probing (sounding). Main Results Forty-nine controlled studies met eligibility criteria and provided clinical outcome data on intrabony defects following grafting procedures. Seventeen studies provided clinical outcome data on BRG materials for the treatment of furcation defects Reviewers' Conclusions With respect to the treatment of intrabony defects, the results of meta-analysis supported the following conclusions: 1) bone grafts increase bone level, reduce crestal bone loss, increase clinical attachment level, and reduce probing depth compared to open flap debridement (OFD) procedures; 2) No differences in clinical outcome measures emerge between particulate bone allograft and calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) ceramic grafts; and 3) bone grafts in combination with barrier membranes increase clinical attachment level and reduce probing depth compared to graft alone. With respect to the treatment of furcation defects, 15 controlled studies provided data on clinical outcomes. Insufficient studies of comparable design were available to submit data to meta-analysis. Nonetheless, outcome data from these studies generally indicated positive clinical benefits with the use of grafts in the treatment of Class II furcations. With respect to histological outcome parameters, 2 randomized controlled studies provide evidence that demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft (DFDBA) supports the formation of a new attachment apparatus in intrabony defects, whereas OFD results in periodontal repair characterized primarily by the formation of a long junctional epithelial attachment. Multiple observational studies provide consistent histological evidence that autogenous and demineralized allogeneic bone grafts support the formation of new attachment. Limited data also suggest that xenogenic bone grafts can support the formation of a new attachment apparatus. In contrast, essentially all available data indicate that alloplastic grafts support periodontal repair rather than regeneration. The results of this systematic review indicate that bone replacement grafts provide demonstrable clinical improvements in periodontal osseous defects compared to surgical debridement alone.

AB  - OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to describe the prevalence of microscopic pancreatic, hepatic and renal lesions in post-mortem samples from cavalier King Charles spaniels. METHODS The prevalence of microscopic lesions was determined by routine histopathology and compared to ante-mortem clinical signs. RESULTS There was evidence of chronic pancreatitis in 51·9% of the cases, and age correlated with severity. Renal lesions were diagnosed in 52·2% of cases, most of which were inflammatory. Ante-mortem diagnosis of pancreatic and renal disease was 25 and 16·7%, respectively. Primary hepatic lesions were diagnosed in 11·1% of cases; secondary hepatic lesions were diagnosed in 64·8%. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Pancreatic and renal lesions are common in cavalier King Charles spaniels, but they have similar rates of hepatic disease as the general population. The increasing prevalence of pancreatic lesions with age suggests that it might be a progressive condition.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the point prevalence of proteinuria in dogs presenting to the University of Georgia Oncology Service for the first time. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, 60 client-owned dogs with a confirmed cancer diagnosis were included but those with lower urinary tract neoplasia were excluded. Each dog's signalment, cancer diagnosis, previous cancer treatments, current medications and travel history were recorded. Renal values, electrolytes, packed cell volume, total solids, systolic blood pressure, urinalysis, urine protein:urine creatinine and retinal examinations were recorded. Non-proteinuric, borderline proteinuria and overt proteinuria were defined as urine protein:urine creatinine <0·2, ≥0·2 but <0·5, and ≥0·5, respectively. Urine culture was performed in dogs with active urine sediments or overt proteinuria. Results Twenty-nine dogs were non-proteinuric (48·3%), 22 (36·7%) borderline proteinuric and nine (15%) overtly proteinuric. None were azotaemic. Hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg) was detected in 18 (30%) dogs. Of these, six were non-proteinuric, nine borderline proteinuric, and three overtly proteinuric. Proteinuria was detected in 51% of dogs presented to our oncology service, the majority of which were classified as borderline. Clinical Significance The high proportion of proteinuria in dogs in this study suggests that screening for proteinuria in dogs with cancer may be prudent. Larger studies are required to correlate specific cancer types and the impact of treatment with the development, magnitude and persistence of proteinuria.
