AB  - OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to describe the prevalence of microscopic pancreatic, hepatic and renal lesions in post-mortem samples from cavalier King Charles spaniels. METHODS The prevalence of microscopic lesions was determined by routine histopathology and compared to ante-mortem clinical signs. RESULTS There was evidence of chronic pancreatitis in 51·9% of the cases, and age correlated with severity. Renal lesions were diagnosed in 52·2% of cases, most of which were inflammatory. Ante-mortem diagnosis of pancreatic and renal disease was 25 and 16·7%, respectively. Primary hepatic lesions were diagnosed in 11·1% of cases; secondary hepatic lesions were diagnosed in 64·8%. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Pancreatic and renal lesions are common in cavalier King Charles spaniels, but they have similar rates of hepatic disease as the general population. The increasing prevalence of pancreatic lesions with age suggests that it might be a progressive condition.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the point prevalence of proteinuria in dogs presenting to the University of Georgia Oncology Service for the first time. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, 60 client-owned dogs with a confirmed cancer diagnosis were included but those with lower urinary tract neoplasia were excluded. Each dog's signalment, cancer diagnosis, previous cancer treatments, current medications and travel history were recorded. Renal values, electrolytes, packed cell volume, total solids, systolic blood pressure, urinalysis, urine protein:urine creatinine and retinal examinations were recorded. Non-proteinuric, borderline proteinuria and overt proteinuria were defined as urine protein:urine creatinine <0·2, ≥0·2 but <0·5, and ≥0·5, respectively. Urine culture was performed in dogs with active urine sediments or overt proteinuria. Results Twenty-nine dogs were non-proteinuric (48·3%), 22 (36·7%) borderline proteinuric and nine (15%) overtly proteinuric. None were azotaemic. Hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg) was detected in 18 (30%) dogs. Of these, six were non-proteinuric, nine borderline proteinuric, and three overtly proteinuric. Proteinuria was detected in 51% of dogs presented to our oncology service, the majority of which were classified as borderline. Clinical Significance The high proportion of proteinuria in dogs in this study suggests that screening for proteinuria in dogs with cancer may be prudent. Larger studies are required to correlate specific cancer types and the impact of treatment with the development, magnitude and persistence of proteinuria.

AB  - Abstract Repair and regeneration of articular cartilage lesions have always been a major challenge in the medical field due to its peculiar structure (e.g., sparsely distributed chondrocytes, no blood supply, no nerves). Articular cartilage tissue engineering is considered as one promising strategy to achieve reconstruction of cartilage. With this perspective, the articular cartilage tissue engineering has been widely studied. Here, the recent progress of articular cartilage tissue engineering is reviewed. The ad hoc therapeutic cells and growth factors for cartilage regeneration are summarized and discussed. Various types of bio/macromolecular scaffolds together with their pros and cons are also reviewed and elaborated.

AB  - SUMMARY Three major antiprotease components in equine serum were identified and characterised. These were the acidic prealbumin Pr, the homologue of human alpha-1 antitrypsin and 2 protease binding proteins, the acidic prealbumin Xc and alpha-2 macroglobulin, both capable of inhibiting the proteolytic activity of trypsin, but with only limited inhibitory effect on its esterolytic activity. The possible role of these serum antiproteases in the onset of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), analogous to the hereditary dysproteinaemia of alpha-1 antitrypsin in man, was investigated. There was no evidence of a genetically determined variation in the protease binding proteins but an increased frequency of the electrophoretically slower Pr antitrypsin alleles was present in horses affected with COPD. However, because of both the mixed breeding of the animals investigated and the lack of correlation with low serum trypsin inhibitory capacity, measured by inhibition of DL-BAPA hydrolysis, the significance of this observation could not be critically assessed. RÉSUMÉ Trois antiproteases majeures ont été identifiées dans le serum du cheval, et caractérisées. Il s'agit de la Pr préalbumine acide, homologue de l'alphaantitrypsine humaine, et de deux protéases, la préalbumine X c acide et la macroglobuline alpha 2, toutes deux capables d'inhiber l'activité protéolytique de la trypsine, mais avec seulement un effet inhibiteur limité sur l'activité estérolytique de cette enzyme. Le rôle éventuel de ces antiprotéases dans l'apparition de la maladie pulmonaire chronique obstructive, analogue à la dysproteinémie héréditaire de l'antitrypsine alpha 1 chez l'Homme, a été recherché. On n'a pas constaté une variation liée à des facteurs génétiques chez ces protéases à l'exception d'une fréquence accrue d'alléles correspondants à des antitrypsines Pr. Cependant, en raison de l'imprécision génétique des animaux étudiés et du manque de corrélation avec la capacité inhibitrice trypsique du serum, la signification de cette observation parait difficile à exploiter. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Drei wichtige Antiproteasen konnten im Pferdeserum identifiziert und charakterisiert werden. Es handelte sich um das saure Prealbumin Pr, ein Homolog des menschlichen alpha-1 Antitrypsins und um zwei Protease-bindenden-Proteine, das saure Praealbumin Xc und alpha-2 Macroglobulin, beide befähigt, die proteolytische Aktivität von Trypsin zu hemmen aber mit nur eingeschränkter, hemmender Wirkung auf dessen esterolytische Aktivität. Die mögliche Bedeutung dieser Serum-Antiproteasen für das Auftreten chronisch obstruktiver Lungenkrankheiten?analog der hereditären Dysproteinaemie von alpha-1 Antitrypsin beim Menschen ?wurde untersucht. Es fanden sich keine Hinweise auf eine genetisch fixierte Variation bei den protease-bindenden Proteinen, aber die elektrophoretisch langsameren Pr Antitrypsinallele kamen bei Pferden mit chronisch obstruktiven Lungenleiden häufiger vor. Die Signifikanz dieser Beobachtung konnte indessen nicht kritisch beurteilt werden, weil die Pferde nicht aus einer Reinzucht stammten und weil sich keine Korrelation mit der tiefen Serumtrypsin-Hemmkapazität (gemessen durch die Hemmung der DL-BAPA Hydrolyse) ergeben hatte.

AB  - Objectives: Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) can be difficult to diagnose. Histopathology is considered the gold standard test but immunohistochemistry (IHC) is mandatory to confirm/exclude the disease. This study aimed to assess the performances of tests carried out in vivo or at postmortem examination in challenging cases in which FIP was confirmed or excluded based on IHC or on adequate follow-up. Methods: Twelve cases (four without FIP, eight with FIP) were retrospectively studied. Clinical findings, serum protein electrophoresis (SPE), analysis of the effusions (AE), antifeline coronavirus serology, serum concentration of α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and histopathology were classified as consistent, doubtful or non-consistent with FIP. Sensitivity, specificity and concordance (?) with the final diagnosis were calculated. Results: Concordance was absent for serology (?=?0·08) and AE (?=?0·52), poor for histopathology (?=0·09), fair for SPE (?=0·25) and perfect for AGP (?=1·00). Sensitivity was high for AGP (100%) and low for AE (50%), SPE (37·5%) and histopathology (37·5%). Specificity was high for AGP or histopathology (100%) and low for SPE (50%) and AE (0%). Clinical Significance: IHC must always be performed to confirm FIP. If this is not possible, when histopathology is controversial, elevated AGP concentrations may support the diagnosis of FIP.

AB  - Summary Background Palmar osteochondral disease (POD) is a common cause of lameness in competition horses. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive diagnostic modality currently available, however it may not be financially or logistically practical for routine screening of POD. There is increasing interest in the use of metabolomics for diagnosis prior to progression to irreversible damage. Objectives To determine metabolite levels in synovial fluid (SF) of horses with a clinical diagnosis of POD based on diagnostic analgesia and MRI, with the hypothesis that metabolomic profiles differ between diseased and healthy joints. Study design Prospective clinical study. Methods Synovial fluid was collected from metacarpo/tarsophalangeal joints (MC/TPJ) of 29 horses (n = 51 joints), including 14 controls (n = 26) and 15 cases (n = 25), the latter with lameness localised to the MC/TPJ and MR changes consistent with POD (n = 23). Spectra were produced using 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and analysed. Results Twenty-five metabolites were recognised associated with various biosynthetic and degradation pathways. The metabolite abundances within the controls demonstrated increased variability compared with the clinical group. The low level of variance between the spectra of the two groups was explained by five principal components. Cross-validation of the cohort demonstrated modest separation of predictive power (R2 = 0.67; Q2 = 0.34). Although statistical significance was not achieved, the most influential metabolites were glucose and lactate. Main limitations The modest sample size and variation in signalment, background and presenting condition of the controls may have impacted the discriminative power of the constructed models. The lack of matched controls, differences in time of fluid collection and freezing times may have also reduced accuracy when representing metabolite profiles. Conclusions This study identified and quantified metabolites present in MC/TPJ SF of clinical cases with POD.

AB  - Abstract Therapeutic treatment targeting one cell type is considered ineffective in remedying any injury to the central nervous system (CNS). Perlecan, a multi-functional, heparan sulfate proteoglycan, shows diverse effects on distinct cell types, suggesting that it is one of the candidates that can augment the regenerative mechanisms in the injured CNS. Therefore, we examined the functions of perlecan in CNS cells in vitro by using perlecan purified from bovine kidney. Perlecan-coated cell culture plates, unlike their type I/III collagen-coated counterparts, did not inhibit the adhesion of neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs) and neurons. The coated perlecan and the perlecan added to the culture medium suppressed astrocyte proliferation; however, perlecan added to the medium promoted NS/PC proliferation. Neurons were promoted to extend their neurites on the perlecan-coated substrate, and perlecan added to the medium also showed a similar effect. NS/PC proliferation and neurite extension is a major regenerative reaction in CNS injury, whereas excess proliferation of astrocytes cause hypertrophy of glial scars, which repels neurons. Our in vitro study suggests that perlecan is an attractive candidate to promote regenerative mechanisms and to suppress reactions that hamper regenerative processes in cases of CNS injury.

AB  - Summary The intestine may be subjected to simple obstruction, in which only the lumen is obstructed, strangulating obstruction, in which both the lumen and vasculature are obstructed, or infarction, in which only the vasculature is obstructed. Each of these may injure intestinal tissues, particularly with interruption of blood flow and subsequent ischemic injury. This can also occur in simple obstruction as the luminal pressure causes collapse of the vasculature within the intestinal wall. Once reperfused, ischemic-injured mucosa may undergo reperfusion injury, depending on the circumstances. This relates to the level of reactive oxygen metabolite generation and infiltration of neutrophils. More recently, repair of the mucosa has been studied in depth, including villus contraction (in the small intestine), epithelial restitution, tight junction closure, and mucosal proliferation. Other layers of the intestine are also injured, particularly the serosa, which can lead to inflammation and development of adhesions.

AB  - Summary objective We aimed to study the effect of biosynthetlc growth hormone (GH) replacement In growth hormone deficient adults. design We performed a double-blind placebo-controlledcross-over study of 6 months biosynthetic GH, replacement and 6 months placebo separated by a 1-month'swashout period. patients Fourteen growth hormone deficient adults were studied. measurements We measured total body weight, percentage fat mass, lean body mass, muscle volume, exercise capacity, maximum oxygen consumption, muscle strength, bone mineral content, a number of biochemical parameters, IGF-I, GH antibodies andpsychological well-being. results Total body weight remained unchanged, but lean body mass increased (before GH mean ± SEM 49·8±5·5, after 53·4±5·6 kg; placebo before 51·2±5·4, after 50·4±5·1 kg; P < 0·05 and fat mass decreased (before GH 21·5±4·1, after 19·3±4·3, placebo before 19·3±4·0, after 22·5±4·5 kg; p < 0·05). Thigh muscle volume increased: (before GH 94·1±7·7, after 99·5±8·4 ml; placebo before 99·3±8·6, after 95·4±7·8 ml/0·8 mm computerized tomographic slice; P < 0·05). Exercise capacity increased (before GH 174·15, after 199·18·9 watts; placebo before 162·5±2·3, after 154·19·8 watts; P < 0·05), as did maximum oxygen consumption (before GH 1·93±0·2, after 2·17±0·2 I/m; placebo before 1·92±0·3, after 1·98±0·2 I/m; P < 0·05). There was no change in quadriceps muscle strength. Alkaline phosphatase increased (before GH 87·5 (32?158), after 106·0 (49?179) U/l; placebo 98·5 (50?145), after 72·0 (40?111) U/l; P < 0·05) without a change in the spinal bone density. IGF-I increased (before GH 62 (36?97), after 216 (62?362) ?g/l; placebo before 59 (52?112), after 60·5 (38?94) ?g/l; P < 0·05). Carbohydrate tolerance remained unchanged as did fasting lipids, serum sodium, potassium, urea, calcium, phosphate and liver transaminases. Psychological well-being remained unchanged. No growth hormone antibodies were detected before or after GH treatment. conclusions GH alters the body composition of growthhormone deficient adults and leads to improved exercisecapacity; alkaline phosphatase activity increases butwithout a change in spinal bone density, and carbohydratetolerance remains unaltered.

AB  - ABSTRACT Well documented limitations associated with primary chondrocytes for cartilage tissue engineering applications have led to increased interest in the use of multi-potent stem/progenitor cells. The objective of this study was to firstly investigate if infrapatellar fat pad-derived stem cells (FPSCs) could be used to engineer cartilage-like tissues through a self-assembly (SA) process, and secondly to compare the properties of such grafts to those engineered by agarose hydrogel encapsulation (AE). Self-assembled cartilaginous tissues were first engineered by geometrically confining FPSCs on tissue culture plastic, and then either continuously or transiently supplementing these constructs with transforming growth factor-?3 (TGF-?3). Transient supplementation with TGF-?3 (for the first 21 days of culture) enhanced the development of self-assembled grafts, with sGAG accumulation reaching levels of 8.4?±?1.5% w/w after 6 weeks of culture. While overall levels of matrix synthesis were higher with AE compared to SA, when normalized to tissue wet weight, ECM accumulation was significantly greater in the lighter SA constructs. A potential drawback with the SA approach on tissue culture plastic was that it often led to the development of contracted, geometrically inconsistent tissues. We therefore next explored if SA on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) transwell membranes would lead to the development of more morphologically stable and homogenous tissues. At high seeding densities, SA on such transwell membranes led to the formation of geometrically uniform constructs that underwent minimal contraction during culture. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate the potential of SA using FPSCs for cartilage tissue engineering, with grafts attaining relatively high levels of sGAG content within clinically relevant timeframes. Such an approach is easily scalable and may lend itself to treating large, full thickness cartilage defects. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2014;111: 1686?1698. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes loss of neurological function and, depending upon the severity of injury, may lead to paralysis. Currently, no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy is available for SCI. High-dose methylprednisolone is widely used, but this treatment is controversial. We have previously shown that low doses of estrogen reduces inflammation, attenuates cell death, and protects axon and myelin in SCI rats, but its effectiveness in recovery of function is not known. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate whether low doses of estrogen in post-SCI would reduce inflammation, protect cells and axons, and improve locomotor function during the chronic phase of injury. Injury (40 g.cm force) was induced at thoracic 10 in young adult male rats. Rats were treated with 10 or 100 ?g 17?-estradiol (estrogen) for 7 days following SCI and compared with vehicle-treated injury and laminectomy (sham) controls. Histology (H&E staining), immunohistofluorescence, Doppler laser technique, and Western blotting were used to monitor tissue integrity, gliosis, blood flow, angiogenesis, the expression of angiogenic factors, axonal degeneration, and locomotor function (Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan rating) following injury. To assess the progression of recovery, rats were sacrificed at 7, 14, or 42 days post injury. A reduction in glial reactivity, attenuation of axonal and myelin damage, protection of cells, increased expression of angiogenic factors and microvessel growth, and improved locomotor function were found following estrogen treatment compared with vehicle-treated SCI rats. These results suggest that treatment with a very low dose of estrogen has significant therapeutic implications for the improvement of locomotor function in chronic SCI. Experimental studies with low dose estrogen therapy in chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) demonstrated the potential for multi-active beneficial outcomes that could ameliorate the degenerative pathways in chronic SCI as shown in (a). Furthermore, the alterations in local spinal blood flow could be significantly alleviated with low dose estrogen therapy. This therapy led to the preservation of the structural integrity of the spinal cord (b), which in turn led to the improved functional recovery as shown (c).

AB  - Abstract Lanthanides, once termed rare-earth elements, are not as sparce in the environment as their traditional name suggests. Mean litospheric concentrations are in fact comparable to the physiologically fundamental elements such as iodine, cobalt, and selenium. Recent advances in medical technology have resulted in accumulation of lanthanides presenting potential exposure to both our central and peripheral nervous systems. Extensive and detailed studies on these peculiar active metals in the context of their influence on neural functions are therefore urgently required. Almost all neurochemical effects of trivalent lanthanide ions appear to result from the similarity of their radii to the key signaling ion calcium. Lanthanides, especially La3+ and Gd3+ block different types of calcium, potassium, and sodium channels in human and animal neurons, regulate neurotransmitter turnover and release, as well as synaptic activity. Lanthanides also act as modulators of several ionotropic receptors, e.g., GABA, NMDA, and kainate and can also affect numerous signaling mechanisms including NF-?B and apoptotic-related endoplasmic reticulum IRE1-XBP1, PERK, and ATF6 pathways. Several lanthanide ions may cause oxidative neuronal injuries and functional impairment by promoting reactive oxygen species production. However, cerium and yttrium oxides have some unique and promising neuroprotective properties, being able to decrease free radical cell injury and even alleviate motor impairment and cognitive function in animal models of multiple sclerosis and mild traumatic brain damage, respectively. In conclusion, lanthanides affect various neurophysiological processes, altering a large spectrum of brain functions. Thus, a deeper understanding of their potential mechanistic roles during disease and as therapeutic agents requires urgent elucidation.

AB  - Chicken egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) is a functional substitute for mammalian IgG for antigen detection. Traditional IgY purification methods involve multi-step procedures resulting in low purity and recovery of IgY. In this study, we developed a simple IgY purification system using IgY-specific peptides identified by T7 phage display technology. From disulfide-constrained random peptide libraries constructed on a T7 phage, we identified three specific binding clones (Y4-4, Y5-14, and Y5-55) through repeated biopanning. The synthetic peptides showed high binding specificity to IgY-Fc and moderate affinity for IgY-Fc (Kd: Y4-4 = 7.3 ± 0.2 ?M and Y5-55 = 4.4 ± 0.1 ?M) by surface plasmon resonance analysis. To evaluate the ability to purify IgY, we performed immunoprecipitation and affinity high-performance liquid chromatography using IgY-binding peptides; the result indicated that these peptides can be used as affinity ligands for IgY purification. We then used a peptide-conjugated column to purify IgY from egg yolks pre-treated using an optimized delipidation technique. Here, we report the construction of a cost-effective, one-step IgY purification system, with high purity and recovery. ? 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Aim: A method for preparing acellular trachea scaffold and its effectiveness were investigated by using rabbits and dogs Methods: The sacrificed dog or rabbit trachea was collected. The spiral stent of stainless steel was inserted in the obtained trachea. To remove all of cellular components in tissues, the trachea was rinsed with sterilized 0.5% Triton X-100 for 24 to 48 hours at ambient temperature and then for removing the detergents completely using fresh water. The acellular trachea obtained was lyophilized and sterilized by ethylene oxide gas. Before implantation, the lyophilized acellular trachea was soaked in phosphate buffered saline containing 0.5% gelatin and other adhesive molecules for 2 to 18 hours at 37 degree. After 15?mm of rabbit neck trachea was removed surgically under anesthesia, the same length of reengorged acellular rabbit trachea was implanted the removed region. In the case of dog, 50?mm of thoracic trachea was removed under the mechanical ventilation and then the same length of reengorged acellular trachea was implanted by technique of end to end anastomosis. The implanted trachea was rapped by omentum. The effectiveness of acellualr scaffold on implanted-animals was evaluated by endoscope finding. Results: 1) The rabbits implanted reengorged-acellular trachea survived for minimum 10 days and maximum 60 days. It was suggested that the cause of death was the infection of implantation region. 2) The dog implanted reengorged-acellular trachea survived for over 60 days at least. The cause of death was strangulated hernia. 3) The acellular trachea containing various growth factors or cultured with fibroblasts was not always effective. Discussion: It is not necessary for the animal implanted acellular trachea to be administered the immunodepressants such as the animal implanted cryopreserved trachea. From these results, the tissue engineered acellular trachea may be more effective than the cryopreserved trachea.

AB  - Copper (CU) deficiency, as reflected by a low serum CU and ceruloplasmin (CER) level, is a rare complication of chronic HD. When present, common clinical manifestations include anemia and neutropenia. Anecdotally, CU deficiency has been linked to the use of sevelamer hydrochloride (SH), a recently introduced phosphate binding agent. The finding of severe CU deficiency and rHuEPO-resistant anemia in 3 of our patients (pts) prompted a review of our entire pediatric HD population for the frequency of CU deficiency and its possible relationship to SH. An assessment of serum CU was conducted in 17 pts (male-11; mean age 169.4?+?49.6?mo) who had received HD for 21.5?+?33.9 months. All pts received three 4-hour HD sessions weekly with mean single-pool and equilibrated Kt/V values of 2.29?+?2.5 and 1.56?+?0.37, respectively. 14 of 17 (82%) pts had low serum CU levels with a mean value of 69.1?+?38.3?mcG/DL (normal?= 85?150?mcG/DL). 9 of 17 (53%) pts had values <60?mcG/DL and 3?pts had values <25?mcG/DL with CER values of 1.2?mg/dL, 0.6?mg/dL, and 1.8?mg/dL, respectively (normal?=?24?40?mg/dL). In the latter 3?pts, hemoglobin values fell to 5.4?gm/dL, 5.2?gm/dL, and 9.2?gm/dL despite regular rHuEPO dosing and adequate iron stores and all pts responded to supplemental CU therapy. The mean hemoglobin of the remaining 14?pts was 11.7?+?1.3?gm/dL. Whereas 13 of 14 (93%) CU deficient pts were receiving SH (142.1?+?112.3?mg/kg/d) for 331.0?+?293.6 days at the time of the CU assessment, there was no significant relationship demonstrated between the dose of SH or the duration of SH therapy and the serum CU level. In conclusion, CU deficiency appears to commonly occur in pediatric HD pts with extremely low values associated with profound anemia responsive to CU therapy. While the chronology of CU deficiency and the introduction of SH suggests an association, additional research is necessary to address this issue in a more definitive manner.

AB  - ABSTRACT Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition clinically diagnosed as a severe elevation in body temperature with central nervous system dysfunction that often includes combativeness, delirium, seizures, and coma. Classic heat stroke primarily occurs in immunocompromised individuals during annual heat waves. Exertional heat stroke is observed in young fit individuals performing strenuous physical activity in hot or temperature environments. Long-term consequences of heat stroke are thought to be due to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. This article provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in the identification of risk factors that predispose to heat stroke, the role of endotoxin and cytokines in mediation of multi-organ damage, the incidence of hypothermia and fever during heat stroke recovery, clinical biomarkers of organ damage severity, and protective cooling strategies. Risk factors include environmental factors, medications, drug use, compromised health status, and genetic conditions. The role of endotoxin and cytokines is discussed in the framework of research conducted over 30 years ago that requires reassessment to more clearly identify the role of these factors in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. We challenge the notion that hypothalamic damage is responsible for thermoregulatory disturbances during heat stroke recovery and highlight recent advances in our understanding of the regulated nature of these responses. The need for more sensitive clinical biomarkers of organ damage is examined. Conventional and emerging cooling methods are discussed with reference to protection against peripheral organ damage and selective brain cooling. Published 2015. Compr Physiol 5:611-647, 2015.
