AB  - Summary Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is a rare multi-organ recessive disease mainly characterised by pancreatic insufficiency, skeletal defects, short stature and bone marrow failure (BMF). As in many other BMF syndromes, SDS patients are predisposed to develop a number of haematopoietic malignancies, particularly myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia. However, the mechanism of cancer predisposition in SDS patients is only partially understood. In light of the emerging role of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in the regulation of bone marrow homeostasis, we assessed the ability of MSCs derived from SDS patients (SDS-MSCs) to recreate a functional bone marrow niche, taking advantage of a murine heterotopic MSC transplant model. We show that the ability of semi-cartilaginous pellets (SCPs) derived from SDS-MSCs to generate complete heterotopic ossicles in vivo is severely impaired in comparison with HD-MSC-derived SCPs. Specifically, after in vitro angiogenic stimuli, SDS-MSCs showed a defective ability to form correct networks, capillary tubes and vessels and displayed a marked decrease in VEGFA expression. Altogether, these findings unveil a novel mechanism of SDS-mediated haematopoietic dysfunction based on hampered ability of SDS-MSCs to support angiogenesis. Overall, MSCs could represent a new appealing therapeutic target to treat dysfunctional haematopoiesis in paediatric SDS patients.

AB  - Aim: A method for preparing acellular trachea scaffold and its effectiveness were investigated by using rabbits and dogs Methods: The sacrificed dog or rabbit trachea was collected. The spiral stent of stainless steel was inserted in the obtained trachea. To remove all of cellular components in tissues, the trachea was rinsed with sterilized 0.5% Triton X-100 for 24 to 48 hours at ambient temperature and then for removing the detergents completely using fresh water. The acellular trachea obtained was lyophilized and sterilized by ethylene oxide gas. Before implantation, the lyophilized acellular trachea was soaked in phosphate buffered saline containing 0.5% gelatin and other adhesive molecules for 2 to 18 hours at 37 degree. After 15?mm of rabbit neck trachea was removed surgically under anesthesia, the same length of reengorged acellular rabbit trachea was implanted the removed region. In the case of dog, 50?mm of thoracic trachea was removed under the mechanical ventilation and then the same length of reengorged acellular trachea was implanted by technique of end to end anastomosis. The implanted trachea was rapped by omentum. The effectiveness of acellualr scaffold on implanted-animals was evaluated by endoscope finding. Results: 1) The rabbits implanted reengorged-acellular trachea survived for minimum 10 days and maximum 60 days. It was suggested that the cause of death was the infection of implantation region. 2) The dog implanted reengorged-acellular trachea survived for over 60 days at least. The cause of death was strangulated hernia. 3) The acellular trachea containing various growth factors or cultured with fibroblasts was not always effective. Discussion: It is not necessary for the animal implanted acellular trachea to be administered the immunodepressants such as the animal implanted cryopreserved trachea. From these results, the tissue engineered acellular trachea may be more effective than the cryopreserved trachea.

AB  - ABSTRACT Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition clinically diagnosed as a severe elevation in body temperature with central nervous system dysfunction that often includes combativeness, delirium, seizures, and coma. Classic heat stroke primarily occurs in immunocompromised individuals during annual heat waves. Exertional heat stroke is observed in young fit individuals performing strenuous physical activity in hot or temperature environments. Long-term consequences of heat stroke are thought to be due to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. This article provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in the identification of risk factors that predispose to heat stroke, the role of endotoxin and cytokines in mediation of multi-organ damage, the incidence of hypothermia and fever during heat stroke recovery, clinical biomarkers of organ damage severity, and protective cooling strategies. Risk factors include environmental factors, medications, drug use, compromised health status, and genetic conditions. The role of endotoxin and cytokines is discussed in the framework of research conducted over 30 years ago that requires reassessment to more clearly identify the role of these factors in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. We challenge the notion that hypothalamic damage is responsible for thermoregulatory disturbances during heat stroke recovery and highlight recent advances in our understanding of the regulated nature of these responses. The need for more sensitive clinical biomarkers of organ damage is examined. Conventional and emerging cooling methods are discussed with reference to protection against peripheral organ damage and selective brain cooling. Published 2015. Compr Physiol 5:611-647, 2015.

AB  - Introduction:? Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a major glycosaminoglycan component of normal dermis and a major component of the matrix synthesized during wound healing. Previous studies have shown that uncrosslinked HA is rapidly degraded and cleared in vivo, limiting its clinical utility. We have used a novel HA hydrogel scaffold that is crosslinked for prolonged bioavailability. It has a porous interior and a smooth surface. This scaffold can also be fabricated with collagen and linked to proteins or DNA to direct cell growth and differentiation. We hypothesized that this novel HA formulation might itself improve wound healing by enhancing cell migration. Purpose:? The present study explored the effects of a crosslinked HA hydrogel on wound healing. Methods:? Using an established model of wound healing, four 7?mm punch wounds were made on each ear of New Zealand rabbits. Each wound was immediately treated with topical application of one of the following: HA hydrogel (n?=?26), HA/collagen hydrogel (n?=?27), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)(n?=?16). Wounds were harvested on day 8 for histologic evaluation. Sections were examined for epithelial and granulation tissue ingrowth into wounds. Results:? HA- and HA/collagen-treated wounds showed statistically significant increases in epithelial (p?=?0.003 and p?=?0.007, respectively) and granulation tissue ingrowth (p?=?0.004 and p?=?0.01, respectively) when compared to PBS-treated controls. Conclusions:? In the rabbit ear ulcer model, the application of crosslinked HA and HA/collagen hydrogels accelerated wound healing as measured by epithelial and granulation tissue ingrowth.

AB  - Cirrhosis (Cir) is often associated with chronic renal failure (CRF) in Egyptian patients on regular hemodialysis (RHD). This is largely attributed to hepatosplenic schistosomiasis and concomitant Hepatitis C viral infection. As the liver has a major role in vitamin D3 activation, we designed this study to envisage the impact of Cir on renal osteodystrophy (ROD). It included 130 consecutive age- and gender-matched subjects in 4 categories. Group I: 39 patients (34 male and 5 female; mean age 48.8 years) with Cir normal renal function; group II: 37 patients (30 male and 7 female; mean age 49.0 years) with CRF and normal liver function, on RHD for a mean duration of 6?±?3.9 years; group III: 41 patients (30 male and 11 female; mean age 50.7 years) with CRF and concomitant Cir, stable on RHD for a mean duration of 7.0?±?4.0 years; and group IV: 16 normal volunteers (13 male and 3 female; mean age 46.3 years). The prevalence of diabetes as well as previous infection with schistosomiasis was similar in all patient groups and that of HCV infection was alike in groups I and III. In all subjects, conventional parameters of liver and renal function were tested; in addition to measurement of serum total protein, albumin, calcium, phosphate, total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP), parathormone (PTH), 5-hydroxycholecalciferol (5HD), 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25HD), Cross Laps (CXL) as a marker of bone resorption, and aminoterminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP) as a measure of bone formation. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by either Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) or Computerized Tomography (CT). Group II patients displayed the typical CRF profile comprising hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, increased total and bone-specific alkaline phosphatases, high PTH and 25HD, low 1,25HD, increased PINP as well as CXL, and generally decreased BMD. Cir (Group III) significantly (p value at least <0.5) modified this profile in several aspects: it checked hypocalcemia (mean 8.8 vs. 7.9?mg/dL in groups II and III, respectively), hyperphosphatemia (5.15 vs. 4.9?mg/dL), and the elevation of B-ALP (62 vs. 30.5??g/L) and PTH (89 vs. 78?pg/mL). It lowered the serum level of 25HD (18.7 vs. 13.7?ng/mL), augmented the deficiency of 1,25HD (13.4 vs. 8.0?pg/mL), did not appreciably affect the increase in bone formation (PINP 77.9 vs. 75.5?ng/mL), but ameliorated its excessive resorption (CXL 21?860 vs. 30?328?pmol/L) noticed in group II. This was associated with amelioration of the dialysis-associated osteopenia (70 vs. 33.5%) and increased incidence of osteosclerosis (30 vs. 61%), as measured by bone mineral density. Conclusion:? Our data indicate that Cir ameliorates ROD through decreased bone resorption. This is associated with better tolerance to 1,25HD deficiency, which initiates the cascade of hypocalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, and increased bone resorption in CRF. Such tolerance may reflect upregulation of vitamin D receptors as a consequence of the humoral perturbation supervening in Cir, involving IGF-1, estrogens, or other vitamin D metabolites as 24,25 HD.

AB  - Purpose To determine the role of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics as biomarkers for the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in acute peripheral nerve injury. Materials and Methods Forty-four adult rats received subepineurial microinjection of MSCs (n?=?22) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS, n?=?22) 1 week after the sciatic nerve trunk crush injury. Sequential fat-suppressed T2-weighted imaging, T2 measurement, DTI and sciatic nerve functional assessment were performed at a 3.0 Tesla MR unit over an 8-week follow-up, with histological assessments performed at regular intervals. The sciatic nerve function index, T2 value, and DTI metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity (RD), and mean diffusivity values of the distal stumps of crushed nerves were measured and compared between the two groups. Results Nerves treated with MSCs showed better functional recovery and exhibited more pronounced nerve regeneration compared with nerves treated with PBS. T2 values in nerves treated with MSCs or PBS showed a similar change pattern (P?=?0.174), while FA and RD values in nerves treated with MSCs showed more rapid return (one week earlier) to baseline level than nerves treated with PBS (P?=?0.045; 0.035). Nerves treated with MSCs had higher FA and lower RD values than nerves treated with PBS during the period from 2 to 3 weeks after surgery (P?≤?0.0001, 0.004; P?=?0.004, 0.006). Conclusion FA and RD values derived from DTI might be used as sensitive biomarkers for detecting the therapeutic effect of stem cells in acute peripheral nerve crush injuries. Level of Evidence: 2 J.

AB  - We present an atypical presentation of Ehrlichiosis induced sepsis requiring hemodialysis. Ehrlichiosis is a common tick-borne illness in Missouri, and in this case mimicks the course of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). A 48-year-old male with a history of marginal zone lymphoma had received radiation and chemotherapy with fludarabine. He was admitted to oncology service for evaluation of nausea and vomiting and generalized malaise. His initial laboratory data revealed platelet count 16,000?mm3, WBC 3,800?mm3, AST 327 units/L, ALT 185 units/L, BUN/Creatinine 53?mg/dl/3.8?mg/dl. Because the peripheral smear showed a morulae consistent with human granulocytic Ehrlichiosis, intravenous doxycycline 100?mg twice daily was initiated. Acute renal failure was thought due to hemodynamic changes, but the role of TTP remained in the differential diagnosis. On hospital day two, he became confused and lethargic and continued to be febrile. Hours later, he developed tonic-clonic seizures and became hypotensive. A clinical diagnosis of TTP was made. Peripheral smear showed only a few schistocytes, inconsistent with TTP. Microangiaopthic anemia, thrombocytopenia, sepsis with DIC, and multi-organ failure sustained the acute renal failure. Hemodialysis was used for ARF over the next several days in conjuction with IV doxycycline. The patient improved without plasmapharesis. Kidney function returned back to normal in due course of time. A final diagnosis of ehrlichia-induced sepsis with ARF was made. Conclusion:?Ehrlichiosis is endemic in Missouri and usually presents with thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver function tests; however it rarely presents with sepsis. The course of this case was made unusual possibly due to chemotherapy, fludarabine for the treatment of lymphoma, which can commonly cause micrangiopathic anemia, myelosuppression, and even a leukopenia for several years afterwards. This presentation mimicking TTP can be confusing but has previously been documented as a complication of severe Ehrlichiosis in the immunocompromised state.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Danofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone developed for veterinary medicine showing an excellent activity. However, danofloxacin pharmacokinetics profile have not been studied in horses previously. Objective: To study the pharmacokinetics following i.v., i.m. and intragastric (i.g.) administration of 1.25 mg/kg bwt danofloxacin to 6 healthy horses. Methods: A cross-over design was used in 3 phases (2 times 2 ? 2), with 2 washout periods of 15 days (n = 6). Danofloxacin (18%) was administered by i.v. and i.m. routes at single doses of 1.25 mg/kg bwt. For i.g. administration an oral solution was prepared and administered via nasogastric tube. Danofloxacin concentrations were determined by HPLC assay with fluorescence detection. Tolerability at the the site of i.m. injection was monitored by creatine kinase (CK) activity. Results: Danofloxacin plasma concentration vs. time data after i.v. and i.g. administration could best be described by a 2-compartment open model. The disposition of i.m. administered danofloxacin was best described by a one-compartment model. The terminal half-lives for i.v., i.m. and i.g. routes were 6.31, 5.36 and 4.74 h, respectively. Clearance value after i.v. dosing was 0.34 l/kg bwt/h. After i.m. administration, absolute bioavailability was mean ± s.d. 88.48 ± 11.10% and Cmax was 0.35 ± 0.05 mg/l. After i.g. administration, absolute bioavailability was 22.36 ± 6.84% and Cmax 0.21 ± 0.07 mg/l. CK activity following i.m. dosing increased 3-fold over pre-injection levels 12 h after dosing and subsequently approached (but did not reach) normal values at 72 h post dose. Conclusions: Systemic danofloxacin exposure achieved in horses following i.m. administration was consistent with the predicted blood levels needed for a positive therapeutic outcome for many equine infections. Conversely, danofloxacin utility by the i.g. route was limited by low bioavailability. Tolerability associated with i.m. administration was high. Potential relevance: Pharmacokinetics, blood levels and good tolerability of i.v. and i.m. administration of danofloxacin in horses indicates that it is likely to be effective for treating sensitive bacterial infections.

AB  - Summary Priapism due to sickle cell disease is a common but less well characterized complication of the disorder. It represents a ?medical emergency? with the key determinant of outcome being the duration of penile ischaemia and time to detumescence of <4 h associated with a successful treatment outcome. Management can be outpatient-based and consists of pre-emptive strategies for early stuttering attacks based on prior health education of the association between the 2 disorders, non pharmacological management, outpatient penile aspiration and irrigation with or without instillation of alpha and beta adrenergic agonists for acute episodes and secondary prophylaxis to prevent the high rates of recurrences. The evidence to recommend medical prophylaxis is sparse but based on a consensus of experts and small phase 2 or III clinical trials. A clearer understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) involving normal and dysregulated erectile physiology, scavenger haemolysis and nitric oxide pathway paves way for the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in medical prophylaxis of stuttering attacks. These agents will need to be studied in multi-centre randomized phase III trials before they become standard of care. A multidisciplinary team approach is required to enhance ?sexual wellness? and prevent erectile dysfunction in this sexually vulnerable group.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) represent an attractive source for regenerative medicine. However, prior to their application, fundamental questions regarding molecular characterisation, growth and differentiation of MSCs must be resolved. Objectives: To compare and better understand the behaviour of equine MSCs obtained from bone marrow (BM) and adipose tissue (AT) in culture. Methods: Five horses were included in this study. Proliferation rate was measured using MTT assay and cell viability; apoptosis, necrosis and late apoptosis and necrosis were evaluated by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression levels of 7 surface marker genes were quantified using RT-qPCR and CD90 was also analysed by flow cytometry. Differentiation was evaluated using specific staining, measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity and analysis of the mRNA expression. Results: High interindividual differences were observed in proliferation in both cell types, particularly during the final days. Statistically significant differences in viability and early apoptosis of cultured AT- and BM-MSCs were found. The highest values of early apoptosis were observed during the first days of culture, while the highest percentage of necrosis and late apoptosis and lowest viability was observed in the last days. Surface marker expression pattern observed is in accordance to other studies in horse and other species. Osteogenic differentiation was evident after 7 days, with an increasing of ALP activity and mRNA expression of osteogenic markers. Adipogenic differentiation was achieved in BM-MSCs from 2 donors with one of the 16 media tested. Chondrogenic differentiation was also observed. Conclusions: Proliferation ability is different in AT-MSCs and BM-MSCs. Differences in viability and early apoptosis were observed between both sources and CD34 was only found in AT-MSCs. Differences in their osteogenic and adipogenic potential were detected by staining and quantification of specific tissue markers. Potential relevance: To provide data to better understand AT-MSCs and BM-MSCs behaviour in vitro.

In the current study we explored changes in GTP-Ras levels following facial nerve injury and the ensuing regeneration and the effects of perturbing these changes in vivo using synapsin-promoter mediated neuronal expression of constitutively active Val12H-Ras (synRas). Quantification of GTP-Ras and total Ras revealed a precipitous drop in the relative GTP-Ras levels in the axotomized facial motor nucleus, to 40% of normal levels at 2?days after cut, followed by a partial recovery to 50?65% at 4?28?days. On western blots, control and axotomized nuclei from synRas mutants showed a 2.2- and 2.5-fold elevation in GTP-Ras, respectively, compared with their wild type littermate controls (p?<?5%, anova, TUKEY post-hoc), with the levels in the axotomized synRas nucleus slightly but not significantly above that in the uninjured littermate control (p?=?9.9%). Similar increase was also observed in the pERK but not pAKT targets of the Ras cascade. This moderate elevation of GTP-Ras strongly curtailed post-traumatic neuronal cell death (?65%), the influx of T-cells (?48%) as well as other parameters of neuroinflammatory response. Although synRas did not affect the speed of axonal regeneration or functional recovery it caused a very pronounced increase in central axonal sprouting. These current data emphasize the role of reduced active Ras, and by extension, the reduced overall level of retrograde neurotrophin signalling after axotomy, in mediating post-traumatic cell death and inflammation and in restricting the sprouting response. Moreover, the neuroprotective and central sprouting-enhancing effects of neuronal Val12H-Ras could help promote recovery in CNS injury.

AB  - Hypoglycaemia is a common, life-threatening complication that occurs as a component of a wide variety of disease processes. Despite its frequent occurrence, information concerning the aetiology, characteristics and outcomes of hypoglycaemic crises in veterinary medicine is limited. This review summarises the current understanding of the pathophysiology of hypoglycaemia, the body's counter-regulatory response, underlying aetiologies, diagnosis and treatment. Disease mechanisms are discussed and published evidence in veterinary literature regarding prognostic indicators, prevalence, diagnosis and treatment is examined for hypoglycaemia-related disease processes including insulinoma, glucose-lowering toxins and medications.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the demographics, clinical characteristics, diagnostic findings, underlying etiologies, treatment, and outcome associated with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP) in cats; and to identify clinical feature differences among cats with asthma associated secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (AASSP) versus nonasthma-associated secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (NAASSP). Design Retrospective case series. Setting University teaching hospital. Animals Sixteen client-owned cats with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results Domestic short hair was the predominant breed in this study (n = 15). The median age was 8 years old (range: 7 weeks to 17 years) with no sex predilection. Fourteen cats were affected by multi-lobar pulmonary pathology of infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic causes. Asthma was the most common cause of spontaneous pneumothorax (25%). Ten of 12 treated cats survived the initial episode of spontaneous pneumothorax to discharge with medical management, including all 4 cats with AASSP. Reoccurrence was documented in 4 cats. Pulmonary lobectomy was curative for 1 cat with congenital accessory lung lobe emphysema. No difference in clinical presentation was identified between cats with AASSP and cats with NAASSP. Conclusions Feline SSP is frequently associated with extensive pulmonary pathology. Supportive medical management is most appropriate, except in rare cases with focal congenital abnormalities that may benefit from surgical intervention. AASSP appears to carry a good prognosis for short-term outcome (survival to discharge). Clinical assessment, imaging, and invasive diagnostics were required to differentiate between AASSP and NAASSP.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?Circulating endothelial cells (CECs) have been identified as markers of vascular damage in a variety of disorders, such as myocardial infarction, vasculitis, and transplantation. CD146-driven immunomagnetic isolation has gained widespread use, but the technique is hampered by the lack of a definition of CECs and the absence of a consensus for their enumeration. Aim:?To evaluate several variables influencing immunomagnetic isolation of CECs, formulate a definition for CECs and propose a consensus protocol for their enumeration. Methods:?We devised a protocol based on CD146-driven immunomagnetic isolation and a subsequent confirmatory step with Ulex-Europaeus-Lectin-1 staining. In a multi-center effort, we evaluated the preanalytical and analytical phases of this protocol. We evaluated the effects of storage, anticoagulation and density centrifugation, and compiled previous experience with this technique. Results:?Our protocol permitted unequivocal identification of CECs with acceptable reproducibility. There was an effect of storage time in that median cell numbers declined to only 87.5% of their baseline values during 24?h of storage at 4?°C. Recovery was lower with citrate than with ethylene-diamine tetra-acetic acid after 4?h of storage; density centrifugation was also associated with lower recovery. We provide a comprehensive list of technical recommendations and potential pitfalls. Finally, based on our experience with this protocol and a recent consensus workshop, we formulated a working definition for CECs. Conclusion:?Our work represents an important step toward consensus regarding the CECs. Our recommendations represent the experience of three major centers and should now be scrutinized by others in the field.

AB  - BACKGROUND Astronauts on exploration missions may be at risk for traumatic injury and medical conditions that lead to life threatening hemorrhage. Resuscitation protocols are limited by the austere conditions of spaceflight. Solutions may be found in low-resource terrestrial settings. The existing literature on alternative blood product administration and walking blood banks was evaluated for applicability to spaceflight. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A literature review was done using PubMed and Google Scholar. References were crosschecked for additional publications not identified using the initial search terms. Twenty-seven articles were identified, including three controlled trials, six retrospective cohort analyses, 15 reviews, one case report, and two experimental studies. RESULTS Solutions to blood transfusion in austere settings include lyophilized blood products, hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs), and fresh whole blood. Many of these products are investigational. Protocols for walking blood banks include methods for screening and activating donors, transfusion, and monitoring for adverse reactions. Microgravity and mission limitations create additional challenges for transfusion, including baseline physiologic changes, difficulty reconstituting lyophilized products, risk of air emboli during transfusion, equipment constraints, and limited evacuation and surgical options. CONCLUSION Medical planning for space exploration should consider the possibility of acute blood loss. A model for ?floating? blood banks based on terrestrial walking blood bank protocols from austere environments is presented, with suggestions for future development. Constraints on volume, mass, storage, and crew, present challenges to blood transfusion in space and must be weighed against the benefits of expanding medical capabilities.

AB  - This case report describes congestive heart failure with pleural effusion in two middle-aged, pet house rabbits. Both had a history of acute onset dyspnoea, weakness and weight loss. Bi-atrial enlargement was seen on echocardiography in both rabbits. One rabbit had atrial fibrillation and ventricular premature complexes identified on electrocardiography. There was a radiographically evident pleural effusion in both rabbits and thoracocentesis was undertaken in one rabbit. These findings were confirmed on post-mortem examination. The aetiology for the underlying heart disease was not found, but the potential types of cardiomyopathies are discussed.

AB  - Musk, the dried secretion of the musk pod (sac) of adult male musk deer, has been used as traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in China and south-east Asian countries for thousands of years. Due to the anabolic steroid component in this TCM, musk preparations have been included in the list of medical products containing prohibited substances employed for doping by the State Food and Drug Administration of China. The application of musk pod formulation was claimed to be responsible for some adverse analytical findings (AAFs) in the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. Our preliminary study has suggested that musk ingestion did not lead to AAFs of doping control with the single dosage of 100 mg. However, the influences of musk administration in large and multi dosage are still unclear. The aim of this study is to further investigate the influences of musk administration for doping control. Wild and domestic deer musk samples were collected. The concentrations and δ13C-values of steroids in musk were analyzed. In an excretion study, 200 and 100 mg of wild and domestic deer musk samples were administrated by 29 subjects, respectively. Fluctuations in steroid profile could be observed, and the ratio of 5α-androstane-3α,17?-diol to 5?-androstane-3α,17?-diol was more sensitive than other parameters. In the IRMS test, the ??δ13C-value between endogenous reference compound and etiocholanolone was a sensitive parameter, and AAFs were obtained. It is the first time to confirm with excretion study that musk administration could lead to positive result of doping control. Copyright ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
