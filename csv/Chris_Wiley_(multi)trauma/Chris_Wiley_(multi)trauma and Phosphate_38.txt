AB  - Summary Functional activities (phagocytosis and killing) of neutrophil leucocytes (NL) and immunoglobulin G concentrations were evaluated in six healthy foals from birth to 6 months of age. Peripheral blood NL were reacted with Streptococcus equisimilis in 20 per cent pooled equine serum for 30, 60 and 90 mins and functional activities of NL were determined using a fluorochrome microassay. Values for foal NL function were compared with those of healthy adult horses (n = 28). Foal neutrophil function was influenced by age. Killing capacity of NL decreased, whereas phagocytic capacity increased, until 113 days of age, after which a reversal in trends became apparent. Immunoglobulin G concentrations changed significantly over time and were lowest at 29 to 56 days of age. All foal values for NL function fell within the range of normal values established for healthy adult horses.

AB  - Abstract Male infertility is a multi-factorial disorder, and identification of its etiology in an individual is critical for treatment. Systematically elucidating the underlying genetic causes (chromosomal and Yq microdeletion) and factors, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), which contribute to sperm DNA damage, may help to reduce the number of men with idiopathic infertility and provide them with the most suitable therapeutics and counseling. This study was done to comprehensively investigate genetic and oxidative stress factors that might be the etiology of a large percentage of men with idiopathic infertility. One hundred twelve infertile men and 76 fertile controls were screened for chromosomal aberrations and Yq microdeletions. ROS, TAC, and sperm DNA damage were assessed in cytogenetically normal, non-azoospermic men with intact Y chromosome (n?=?93). ROS was assessed in neat and washed semen by chemiluminescence; seminal TAC with a commercially available kit; and sperm DNA damage by the comet assay. Two men had cytogenetic abnormalities and seven men harbored Yq microdeletions. ROS levels in neat and washed semen of infertile men were significantly higher (P?<?0.01) than controls. Infertile men had significantly lower (P?<?0.01) TAC levels (1.79?mM), whereas sperm DNA fragmentation in infertile men was significantly higher (P?<?0.01) than controls. Genetic factors and oxidative stress cumulatively account for large number of idiopathic infertile cases. Unlike, genetic causes, which cannot be cured, timely identification and management of oxidative stress may help to reverse/reduce the effects on induced DNA damage, and improve the outcomes for infertile males.

AB  - Abstract Aims Diabetic kidney disease independently predicts cardiovascular disease and premature death. We examined the burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD, defined as an estimated GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and quality of care in a cross-sectional survey of adults (age ≥ 18 years) with Type 2 diabetes across Asia. Methods The Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation programme is a disease-management programme implemented using an electronic portal that systematically captures clinical characteristics of all patients enrolled. Between July 2007 and December 2012, data on 28 110 consecutively enrolled patients (China: 3415, Hong Kong: 15 196, India: 3714, Korea: 1651, Philippines: 3364, Vietnam: 692, Taiwan: 78) were analysed. Results In this survey, 15.9% of patients had CKD, 25.0% had microalbuminuria and 12.5% had macroalbuminuria. Patients with CKD were less likely to achieve HbA1c < 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) (36.0% vs. 42.3%) and blood pressure < 130/80 mmHg (20.8% vs. 35.3%), and were more likely to have retinopathy (26.2% vs. 8.7%), sensory neuropathy (29.0% vs. 7.7%), cardiovascular disease (26.6% vs. 8.7%) and self-reported hypoglycaemia (18.9% vs. 8.2%). Despite high frequencies of albuminuria (74.8%) and dyslipidaemia (93.0%) among CKD patients, only 49.0% were using renin?angiotensin system inhibitors and 53.6% were on statins. On logistic regression, old age, male gender, tobacco use, long disease duration, high HbA1c, blood pressure and BMI, and low LDL cholesterol were independently associated with CKD (all P < 0.05). Conclusions The poor control of risk factors, suboptimal use of organ-protective drugs and high frequencies of hypoglycaemia highlight major treatment gaps in patients with diabetic kidney disease in Asia.

AB  - Abstract In contrast with a thermal plasma surgical instrument based on coagulative and ablative properties, low-temperature (non-thermal) non-equilibrium plasmas are known for novel medicinal effects on exposed tissue while minimizing undesirable tissue damage. In this study we demonstrated that arrays of non-thermal microplasma jet devices fabricated from a transparent polymer can efficiently inactivate fungi (Candida albicans) as well as bacteria (Escherichia coli), both in vitro and in vivo, and that this leads to a significant wound-healing effect. Microplasma jet arrays offer several advantages over conventional single-jet devices, including superior packing density, inherent scalability for larger treatment areas, unprecedented material flexibility in a plasma jet device, and the selective generation of medically relevant reactive species at higher plasma densities. The therapeutic effects of our multi-jet device were verified on second-degree burns in animal rat models. Reduction of the wound area and the histology of the wound after treatment have been investigated, and expression of interleukin (IL)-1α, -6 and -10 was verified to evaluate the healing effects. The consistent effectiveness of non-thermal plasma treatment has been observed especially in decreasing wound size and promoting re-epithelialization through collagen arrangement and the regulation of expression of inflammatory genes.

AB  - ABSTRACT Forty dogs diagnosed as having chronic osteoarthritis took part in a double-blind clinical dose-response study using the antiarthritic agent pentosan polysulphate (PPS). After complete physical examination to ensure good general health, dogs received four subcutaneous injections at intervals of one week of 0, 1, 3 or 5 mg/kg PPS from code-numbered bottles. At weekly intervals and four weeks after the last injection, weakness, stiffness, pain on joint manipulation, willingness to exercise, body condition and overall response were scored. There were no differences between groups in baseline data, but dogs receiving PPS had a favourable response compared to dogs receiving a placebo for lameness, body condition, pain on joint manipulation and willingness to exercise. The 3 mg/kg dose rate gave the best improvement, the 1 mg/kg dose was partially effective and the 5 mg/kg group was least effective. The use of PPS at a dose rate of 3 mg/kg for the treatment of clinical osteoarthritis in dogs is indicated by our study.

AB  - When the pulp of a tooth is irreversibly inflamed or necrotic and the apex is open, conventional root canal treatment is difficult to perform and the outcome is uncertain. Traditionally, the apexification procedure has consisted of multiple and long-term applications of calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] to create an apical barrier to aid the obturation. Recently, artificial apical barriers such as those made with mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) have been used in teeth with necrotic pulps and open apices. More recently, procedures referred to as regenerative endodontics have received much attention as an option for these teeth. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive literature review from May 1952?May 2011 regarding the management of teeth with necrotic pulps and open apices. This review covers the articles published in dental journals and book chapters regarding the definition, history, materials used, animal and human studies, mechanisms of action, prognosis, as well as advantages and disadvantages of apexification, apical plugs, and regenerative endodontics.

AB  - Abstract A bioactive glass series (0.42SiO2?0.10Na2O-0.08CaO-(0.40 ? x)ZnO-(x)Ga2O3) was synthesized, and it is efficacy against the Gram (?ve) bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli), the Gram (+ve) bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and the fungus Candida albicans (C. albicans), were characterized through liquid broth analysis. The glass series was also seeded in CMC-Dex hydrogels at three different loadings (0.05, 0.10, and 0.25 m2), and the antibacterial and antifungal efficacies of the resulting composites were characterized using both liquid broth and agar diffusion analysis. Liquid broth analysis was conducted using liquid extracts, which for glass samples were obtained after incubation for up to 30 days in both ultrapure water and phosphate buffered saline (PBS), while glass-hydrogel extracts were obtained solely in PBS. Glass extracts (water) decreased C. albicans viability, while those obtained in PBS decreased the viability of both E. coli and C. albicans. Glass-hydrogel extracts exhibited slight inhibition of E. coli and C. albicans. However, none of the liquid extracts decreased S. aureus viability. Glass-hydrogel composites produced inhibition zones in all three microbial cultures, with the greatest efficacy against C. albicans. The results of this study suggest these materials have potential as bone void-filling materials which display antifungal, and possibly, antibacterial properties. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a systemic disorder affecting elastic tissues most markedly in skin, retina, and blood vessels. It is caused by mutations in the ABCC6 gene and is transmitted in an autosomal recessive fashion. In 1994 a new classification system for PXE was published as the result of a consensus conference. Since then the ABCC6 gene has been discovered. We propose that there is a need for a classification system incorporating all relevant systemic symptoms and signs, based on standardized clinical, histological, and molecular biological examination techniques. We re-evaluated the histopathologic PXE signs and propose a classification system with unambiguous criteria leading to a consistent diagnosis of definitive, probable, or possible PXE world-wide. We put this proposed classification forward to encourage further debate on the diagnosis of this multi-organ disorder. ? 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT The prevalence of Chlamydia psittaci infection in household, feral and farm cats in Britain was investigated. Chlamydia were isolated from 30 per cent of conjunctival swabs collected from 753 household cats with conjunctivitis. The prevalence of active chlamydial infection was highest in cats in the age group five weeks to nine months. Males were more frequently infected than females. Cats with chlamydial conjunctivitis usually had antibody titres greater than 1024 as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence. Chlamydia appeared to be endemic in two out of three feral cat colonies on the basis of serological evidence and occasional isolations. Cats on 10 of 22 sheep farms (45 per cent) had serological evidence of chlamydial infection, and this was confirmed on two farms by isolation of the organism from conjunctival and, or, rectal swabs. This is the first survey of infection with Chlamydia psittaci in cat populations in Britain.

AB  - Objectives Oral malignant melanomas carry a poor-to-guarded prognosis because of their local invasiveness and high metastatic propensity. The Oncept melanoma vaccine is licensed to treat dogs with stage II or III locally-controlled oral malignant melanoma and this retrospective study aimed to assess survival of affected dogs treated with the vaccine in the UK. Material and Methods Medical records of dogs with histopathologically-confirmed oral malignant melanoma that received the vaccine as part of their treatment were evaluated. Survival analyses for potential prognostic factors were performed. Results Sixty-nine dogs were included; 56 dogs, staged I to III, and with previous locoregional therapy, had a median survival time of 455 days (95% CI: 324 to 586 days). Based on Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with associated log-rank testing, no significant prognostic factors were identified for this population. Of the 13 patients with macroscopic disease treated with vaccine alone or in combination therapy, eight showed clinical response. Three patients with stage IV oral malignant melanoma survived 171, 178 and 288 days from diagnosis. Clinical Significance Patients treated with the melanoma vaccine in our study had survival times similar to their counterparts receiving the vaccine in the USA. There were observed responses in patients with macroscopic disease and so the vaccine could be considered as palliative treatment in dogs with stage IV disease.

AB  - Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is linked to certain common brain pathologies (e.g., ischemia, stroke, and trauma) believed to facilitate its development and progression. One of the logical approaches to this problem is to study the effects of ischemia and hypoxia on the metabolism of amyloid precursor protein, which plays one of the key roles in the pathogenesis of AD. This involves an analysis of (1) proteases, which participate in proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein either by the nonamyloidogenic route (α-secretase) or the amyloidogenic pathway and lead to formation of toxic ?-amyloid peptides (?- and ?-secretases) and (2) several metallopeptidases that might play a role in degradation of ?-amyloid peptide (A?). The study of the effects of prenatal hypoxia and acute hypoxia in adult animals allowed us to conclude that oxygen deprivation results not only in an increase of amyloid precursor protein expression in the brain but also in a decrease in the activity of α-secretase. In some brain structures involved in AD pathology (the cortex and striatum), we also observed a decrease in the expression of two of the A? degrading enzymes, neprilysin and endothelin-converting enzyme, after hypoxia. A decrease in expression of these metalloproteases was also observed in the model of four-vessel occlusion ischemia in rats with their restoration to the control levels after reperfusion. Preconditioning to mild hypoxia both in the prenatal period and in adults appeared to have a neuroprotective effect restoring, in particular, the levels of amyloid precursor protein, activity of a-secretase, and expression of neprilysin and endothelin-converting enzyme to their control values.

AB  - Summary Larger grade 1 or 2 (1 = excellent, ?. 4 = degenerate) equine embryos that ranged in diameter from 300 to 680 ?m and were recovered from mares on Day 7 or 8 after ovulation, were randomly assigned to 3 widely divergent cryopreservation treatments. Treatment 1 consisted of cooling from ?6°C to ?35°C at 0.5°C per min followed by plunging into liquid nitrogen, with a one-step addition and a 4-step removal of 1.0 M glycerol. Treatment 2 (step-down equilibration) consisted of a 2-step addition of glycerol to 4.0 M followed by a decrease to 2.0 M prior to freezing, with galactose present in the final step and in all glycerol removal steps and with a cooling protocol identical to Treatment 1. Treatment 3 was a standard vitrification protocol with step-wise addition of ethylene glycol up to 11.9 M, and step-wise removal of cryoprotectant with decreasing concentrations of galactose in the dilution medium. The cryoprotectants were removed at 20?21°C. After the final dilution, the embryos were cultured in 5% CO2-in-air for 36 h at 38.5°C on equine oviductal epithelial cell monolayers. Their morphology was then evalued, their capsules were removed mechanically, and they were fixed prior to staining with 1% w:v orcein in 45% acetic acid to assess the morphology of their nuclei and cytoplasm. All 7 embryos in Treatment 1 degenerated during thawing or culture. Of the 6 embryos included in Treatment 2, 4 were graded 1, one was graded 2 and one graded 3 after culture in vitro. Of the 7 embryos in Treatment 3, one was graded 2, one was graded 3 and the remaining 5 were degenerate (P < 0.01 among treatments). The average changes in initial diameter exhibited by the frozen/thawed embryos during culture after thawing were: Treatment 1, ?91 ?m; Treatment 2, +179 ?m; Treatment 3, +20 ?m (P < 0.05). Two 26-day pregnancies were established following transfer of 6 Treatment 2 embryos (step-down equilibration method) to recipient mares.

AB  - Summary This study reports the use of parathyroid hormone fragment peptide 1-34 (PTH1-34) cross-linked to a hydrogel in a fibrin base for the treatment of subchondral cyst-like lesions (SCLs). The objectives were to determine the clinical and radiographic outcome of 28 horses with lameness attributable to one or two SCLs treated locally with one of three different concentrations of PTH1-34 and to identify which concentration produces the best results. Twenty-eight horses (34 SCLs) were treated surgically by debriding the content of the SCL and injecting different concentrations (0.1, 0.4, or 1 mg/mL) of PTH1-34 in a fibrin hydrogel into the cavity. Treatment was considered successful if the horse was sound 12 months after treatment. The mean age of the horses was 7.2 years. Treatment was successful in 22 (78.6%) horses and improved the radiographic appearance of 27 (79.4%) SCLs. The outcome was not affected by age of the horse or by the number of SCLs (1 or 2) per horse. PTH1-34 in a fibrin hydrogel administered into the SCL after surgical debridement of the lesion appears to be an effective treatment for horses with one or two SCLs. A PTH1-34 concentration of 0.4 mg/mL may be slightly superior to concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0 mg/mL in resolving SCLs.

AB  - Abstract Injuries to peripheral nerves and/or skeletal muscle can cause scar tissue formation and loss of function. The focus of this article is the creation of a conductive, biocompatible scaffold with appropriate mechanical properties to regenerate skeletal muscle. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) nanoparticles (Np) were electrospun with poly(?-caprolactone) (PCL) to form conductive scaffolds. During electrospinning, ribboning, larger fiber diameters, and unaligned scaffolds were observed with increasing PEDOT amounts. To address this, PEDOT Np were sonicated prior to electrospinning, which resulted in decreased conductivity and increased mechanical properties. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) were added to the 1:2 solution in an effort to increase conductivity. However, the addition of MWCNT had little effect on scaffold conductivity, and the elastic modulus and yield stress of the scaffold increased as a result. Rat muscle cells attached and were active on the 1?10, 1?2, 3?4, and 1?1 PCL-PEDOT scaffolds; however, the 3?4 scaffolds had the lowest level of metabolic activity. Although the scaffolds were cytocompatible, further development of the fabrication method is necessary to produce more highly aligned scaffolds capable of promoting skeletal muscle cell alignment and eventual regeneration. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: In order to evaluate its potential as an adjunct to inhalant anaesthesia in horses, the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl must first be determined. Objectives: To describe the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl and its metabolite, N-[1-(2-phenethyl-4-piperidinyl)maloanilinic acid (PMA), after i.v. administration of a single dose to horses that were awake in Treatment 1 and anaesthetised with isoflurane in Treatment 2. Methods: A balanced crossover design was used (n = 4/group). During Treatment 1, horses received a single dose of fentanyl (4 ?g/kg bwt, i.v.) and during Treatment 2, they were anaesthetised with isoflurane and maintained at 1.2 ? minimum alveolar anaesthetic concentration. After a 30 min equilibration period, a single dose of fentanyl (4 ?g/kg bwt, i.v.) was administered to each horse. Plasma fentanyl and PMA concentrations were measured at various time points using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results: Anaesthesia with isoflurane significantly decreased mean fentanyl clearance (P < 0.05). The fentanyl elimination half-life, in awake and anaesthetised horses, was 1 h and volume of distribution at steady state was 0.37 and 0.26 l/kg bwt, respectively. Anaesthesia with isoflurane also significantly decreased PMA apparent clearance and volume of distribution. The elimination half-life of PMA was 2 and 1.5 h in awake and anaesthetised horses, respectively. Conclusions and potential relevance: Pharmacokinetics of fentanyl and PMA in horses were substantially altered in horses anaesthetised with isoflurane. These pharmacokinetic parameters provide information necessary for determination of suitable fentanyl loading and infusion doses in awake and isoflurane-anaesthetised horses.

AB  - Summary This study investigates the present situation with respect to the use and abuse of (veterinary) medicinal products (VMPs) by equine practitioners and endeavours to substantiate the perceived discrepancies and friction between the availability of VMPs, legislation in force, code of Good Veterinary Practice and reality of day-today equine practice. It can be concluded that practising equine medicine in The Netherlands using only authorised equine VMPs is impossible. In most cases the ?cascade? or list of essential substances is needed to legitimise the use or, even worse, the use is not legitimised at all. Existing differences between European Union member states in the outcome of procedures for obtaining a marketing authorisation for the same product is seen as an obstacle for the availability and development of equine VMPs needed for safeguarding the future of a professional equine veterinary healthcare.

AB  - Summary The clinical features of 106 horses presenting with chronic colic examined over a 5 year period were reviewed. Chronic colic was defined as colic signs observed, daily for 3 days or longer, except when masked by analgesics. The diagnosed causes of chronic colic included colonic impaction (31%), peritonitis (16%), enteritis/colitis (7%), colonic displacement/torsion (6%) and lymphosarcoma (4%). A variety of other diseases were diagnosed in a small number of cases, including intestinal adhesions, ileal obstructions, grass sickness, liver disease, caecal impactions, thromboembolic disease, intussusceptions etc. No diagnosis was reached in 8% of cases. Diagnosis was relatively easily achieved in most cases of colonic impaction and peritonitis by results of transrectal palpation and evaluation of peritoneal fluid. Specific clinical features, transrectal palpation, abdominal paracentesis and laboratory evaluations of blood were helpful in the diagnosis of some of the other diseases, but exploratory laparotomy remained necessary in a few cases to achieve a diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To describe the biological characteristics of exosomes and to summarize the current status of stem cell-derived exosomes on fracture healing. Meanwhile, future challenges, limitations and perspectives are also discussed. Methods Search and analyze the related articles in pubmed database through the multi-combination of keywords like ?stem cells?,?exosomes?,?bone regeneration? and ?fracture healing?. Conclusion Stem cell-derived exosome therapy for fracture healing has been enjoying popularity and is drawing increasing attention. This strategy helps to promote proliferation and migration of cells, as well as osteogenesis and angiogenesis, in the process of bone formation. Although the exact mechanisms remain elusive, exosomal miRNAs seem to play vital roles. Future studies are required to solve multiple problems before clinical application, including comprehensive and thorough understanding of exosomes, the exact roles of exosomes in regulating bone formation, and the optimal source, dose and frequency of treatment, as well as technical and safety issues. Moreover, studies based on fracture models of large animals are could offer guidance and are in demand.
