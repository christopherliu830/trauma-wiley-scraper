AB  - Introduction It has been debated which airway sampling method, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or tracheal aspirate (TA), is superior in evaluating equine respiratory disease. Most studies suggest BAL is the best sampling method due to better correlation with lung histopathology. In this study we compared BAL and TA results of athletic non-Thoroughbred horses with chronic respiratory signs or exercise intolerance during 2009?2013. Methods 64 horses, 2?25 years of age (16 Coldbloods, 30 Warmbloods, 11 Standardbreds, 7 ponies) with recurrent or chronic (duration >1 month) respiratory signs or exercise intolerance that were subject to both BAL and TA sampling at rest were included. Neutrophil counts >5% in BAL and >20% in TA were considered abnormal. Statistical analysis was performed with Spearman's correlation coefficient. Results Both BAL and TA were abnormal in 29 horses and normal in 26 horses. 7 horses had only abnormal TA and 2 horses only abnormal BAL. Correlation was found between the amount of mucus in the trachea and both BAL (P?=?0.002) and TA (P<0.001) neutrophil percentage. Neutrophil (P<0.001), eosinophil (P<0.001), lymphocyte (P?=?0.008) and macrophage (P?=?0.004) percentages correlated between BAL and TA. Conclusions In our university hospital population, mucus in the trachea was a good indicator of airway neutrophilia. Unlike previous studies, in only 14% of the horses the interpretation of BAL and TA result was different with TA being slightly more sensitive at detecting neutrophilia. However, a gold standard for detecting inflammation in the equine airways is still lacking and the type and severity of the disease may greatly influence the best choice of sampling method.

AB  - Introduction There are few refereed blinded controlled documentations of skeletal analgesic efficacy of firocoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor. The objective was to test the hypotheses that intravenous firocoxib and phenylbutazone are comparable in efficacy and that both are more efficacious in alleviating lameness than placebo in an adjustable heart bar shoe model of equine foot pain. Methods Eight healthy adult horses (5 Thoroughbreds, 3 Quarter horses, mean age 8.3?±?0.9 years, age range 4?13 years) underwent weekly intravenous treatments 1 hour after lameness induction. Treatments were isotonic saline placebo (1?ml/45?kg body weight), phenylbutazone (4.4?mg/kg), and firocoxib (label dosage 0.09?mg/kg). Treatments were randomly assigned and administered by co-investigators who had no input on Heart Rate (HR) and Lameness Score (LS) measurements. Another investigator who was unaware of treatment assignments monitored HR and LS every 20?min for 5 hours after lameness induction and then hourly through 12 hours after treatment. One and two weeks later treatments were shuffled and the experiment was repeated. Repeated measures ANOVA and post hoc Tukey's test were used to identify analgesic effects at a significance level of P<0.05. Results HR and LS were not different between saline and firocoxib. Post-treatment phenylbutazone HR (2.3?3.3, 5, and 10 hours) and LS (2.3?8 hours) were lower than saline (P<0.05). Phenylbutazone HR (10 and 12 hours) and LS (1.67?11 hours) were lower than firocoxib (P<0.05). Conclusions It was concluded that firocoxib at this label dosage was not different than placebo and that phenylbutazone was more effective than firocoxib and saline.

AB  - Introduction Resistance training provided by underwater (UWT) treadmills may enhance strength and fatigue resistance of superficial digital flexor muscle thereby reducing tendon injury. This study examined effects of UWT and land (LT) treadmill training on SDF and gluteal muscle. Methods Six unfit horses (3???2 crossover design, 60d detraining period) walked on UWT and LT for 5d/week for 8 weeks (up to 40?min/day). A standardized exercise test (SET) was performed 2 weeks before, and after L or UW training, and V180?bpm and La10.5?m/s calculated. Resting and post-SET gluteal and SDF muscle biopsies were obtained. Muscle [glycogen], [lactate] and [ATP], fiber type composition and min/max fiber diameters were analysed. Comparisons were made using GLM or ANOVA, mean?±?SD and significance of P<0.05. Results Post-exercise SDF muscle lactate increased 3?4 fold to 30?±?12 (UWT) and 41?±?15 (LT) mmol/kg dw post-exercise. Post-exercise gluteal muscle lactate increased 2 fold to 55?±?18 (UWT) and 62?±?18 (LT) mmol/kg. No significant differences were found between UW and L post-exercise muscle [glycogen], [lactate] and [ATP], V180 or LA10.5 or fiber type composition. Gluteal fiber diameters decreased significantly with UW and L training. Fiber diameters in SDF muscle decreased with training to a significantly lesser extent after UW vs. L training. Conclusions At maximal speed, both SDF and gluteal muscle have a significant anaerobic response which was not impacted by UWT or LT training at a walk. UWT may be of benefit by attenuating the training induced decrease in fiber sizes in SDF muscle thereby enhancing SDF muscle strength.

AB  - Introduction Mitochondria play a central role in energy metabolism during muscle contraction and in the balance of anaerobic and aerobic energy production. This study evaluated mitochondrial respirometry in skeletal muscle of eventing horses before and after an intense effort. Methods Fourteen Brazilian Sport Horses 4 to 6 years old performed an incremental velocity test on a high speed treadmill inclined to 3% and galloped at speeds up to 8?m/s until exhaustion. Biopsies from the gluteus medius muscle were obtained before and immediately after the end of the test. Mitochondrial respiration was assessed by O2K oxygraph of high resolution (Oroboros). The results were standardized by minute and per gram of wet weight of muscle and expressed as mean?±?SD. Plasma lactate was measured using a spectrophotometer. Results were compared by paired t?test (P<0.05). Results The maximal respiration value of mitochondria did not change in gluteus medius muscle of horses at exhaustion. However, there was an increase in stage 3 mitochondrial respiration with pyruvate/malate substrate, and also an increase of non-mitochondrial respiration after exercise. Lactate values before and after exercise were 0.4?±?0.1?mmol/L and 12.1?±?4.6?mmol/L, respectively. Conclusions There is little change in mitochondrial respirometry in the gluteus medius muscle after intense exercise indicating predominantly anaerobic metabolism in the muscle of the eventing horses, as supported by the high plasma lactate concentrations after the test. The increase of oxidase reactions after intense exercise is related to an increase in non-mitochondrial respiration.

AB  - Introduction Measurement of incorporation of stable isotope-containing amino acids into muscle is the gold-standard technique for measuring muscle protein synthesis (MPS), but its use in assessing MPS in horses has not been evaluated. Determination of MPS requires steady-state tracer plasma enrichment and serial muscle biopsy. Given that MPS is often assessed in response to exercise and that muscle biopsy in the standing horse typically requires sedation, the influence of exercise and sedation on tracer kinetics was determined. Methods Three mature Thoroughbred geldings received 0.1?mg/kg D5-phenylalanine (D5-Phe) IV and plasma D5-Phe enrichment was measured over 3?hrs. Pharmacokinetic modeling determined the rate of appearance and phenylalanine pool size, from which a loading dose and infusion rate that would achieve a steady 5?10% enrichment were calculated. Subsequently, steady-state was confirmed by measuring plasma enrichment during 6 hours of infusion after loading. Horses then received the same dose and completed a 12-minute exercise test and were sedated with xylazine 0.4?mg/kg IV. Plasma D5-Phe enrichment was determined every 5?15 minutes for 2 hours after both exercise and sedation. Results The mean rate of phenylalanine appearance in the horse was 56?umol/kg/hr (SD 24) and mean phenylalanine pool size 41?umol/kg (SD 8.8). A loading dose of 3.3?umol/kg and an infusion rate of 4.5?umol/kg/hr D5-phenylalanine was calculated and subsequently, confirmed to achieve steady state tracer concentration at 5.6?9.1% APE in sedentary horses. Exercise caused a transitory, and sedation a more prolonged reduction in plasma enrichment (up to 20%). Conclusions D5-phenylalanine is a suitable metabolic tracer in the horse as a steady-state can be achieved, however interventions should be taken into account.

AB  - Introduction Obesity creates many metabolic issues in horses, yet stepwise alterations in mitochondrial capacity and oxidant status during weight loss have not been assessed. Skeletal muscle contains subsarcolemmal (SSM) and interfibrillar (IFM) mitochondria, which respond differently to physiological stimuli, impacting tissue and systemic oxidant status. It was hypothesised that horses would display improved muscle mitochondrial subpopulation function in middle gluteal muscle, and decreases in circulating oxidant status markers during weight loss from an obese (7 to 8) to moderate (5) body condition score (BCS). Methods 8 light-type horses were studied. Mitochondrial subpopulations were isolated through differential centrifugation and all enzymatic activity through colorimetric kinematic assays. Effects of BCS reduction or percent weight loss were evaluated using SAS (mixed procedure with repeated measures). Results Plasma nitrate decreased in response to BCS reduction (P?=?0.06) and percent weight loss (P?=?0.06), whereas erythrocyte total glutathione (P?=?0.06) concentration increased with decreasing BCS. Mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and IV displayed greater activity in SSM than IFM (P≤0.03), while all complexes in IFM had decreased activity due to both weight parameters (P≤0.01). Interactions between subpopulation complex IV activity and weight loss markers (P<0.05) were displayed. Citrate synthase activity, indicating mitochondrial number, was greater in SSM than IFM (P<0.0001) but was unaffected with weight loss. Lipid peroxidation was decreased with BCS change (P?=?0.01) and weight loss (P?=?0.02), displaying greater amounts in SSM than IFM (P≤0.02). Conclusions Alterations in complex activities and lipid peroxidation suggest IFM are more affected by weight loss, with large contributions from complex IV by-products. Mitochondrial component flexibility may contribute individually to disease development and performance of equine athletes.

AB  - Introduction Horse owners are faced with a vast range of supplements and different sources of information. The aim of this study was to evaluate sources of information used by owners/riders when choosing supplements for competition horses, their opinions on different sources of information and evaluation of factors that affect their decisions. Methods A mixed methods (open and closed questions) online questionnaire was distributed through British Eventing and Dressage websites to owners/riders of dressage and/or event horses, to collect data on the demographics of the owner/rider and their horses, sources of information used when choosing nutritional supplements, and their opinion on these different sources. Data was evaluated using descriptive analysis and Chi-squared tests for quantitative data, and thematic analysis for qualitative data. Results 757 responses met the inclusion criteria, and owners/riders competed at dressage and eventing from unaffiliated novice to affiliated advanced level. Veterinary surgeons were considered the most reliable source of information, followed by nutritionists, research studies, coach/trainer and other horse owners. ?Other horse owners? were the top source (18% of participants) for the participants' most recent choice of supplement. Respondents with a higher education qualification were significantly more likely to use research papers as a source of information (P<0.005). Owners/riders under 34 years of age were significantly more likely to use a coach / trainer as a source of information (P<0.005). Conclusions Horse owners identified veterinary surgeons, nutritionists and research papers as reliable sources of information, but ultimately most chose their supplement based on recommendations of other owners or coaches/trainers.

AB  - Introduction Exercise training results in improved mitochondrial efficiency but it is unclear if dietary selenium level can further modify mitochondrial function. Methods American Quarter Horse yearlings (n?=?20; mean?±?SE 18?±?0.2 months) balanced with regard to age and sex were randomly assigned to four dietary Se and exercise training treatments for 14 weeks: 0.1?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training or 0.3?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training. Trained horses were exercised 4?d/wk for 30?min/d. At week 14, all horses underwent a 2?hr, 27.5?km submaximal exercise test (SET). Permeabilized muscle fibers obtained from the gluteus medius of horses at rest were analysed for mitochondrial function via high resolution respirometry. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity with Complex I substrates was determined using the respiratory control ratio (RCR) of state 3 (with ADP) and state 2 (without ADP; leak respiration). Electron transport system capacity (ETSC) was determined by uncoupling phosphorylation and respiration using carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. Cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) and citrate synthase (CS) activities were assessed in resting muscle samples obtained at week 0 and 14, and in response to the SET. Data were analysed using a mixed model ANOVA. Results Leak, state 3, ETSC, CS and CCO were higher (P<0.05) at wk 14 compared to wk 0 in all horses, but were not affected by training or Se level. Additionally, CS and CCO were unaffected by the SET. Conclusions Mitochondrial number (CS activity) and efficiency were unaffected by training and dietary Se level, but did increase over time, perhaps due to growth of horses. A more strenuous training protocol may be needed to induce mitochondrial adaptations.

AB  - Introduction The study aim was to determine whether there is a link between pelvic misalignment and uneven forelimb hoof size. Previous research suggests that increased loading increases hoof size, but correlation with pelvic misalignment is unknown. Methods 30 healthy, sound, multidiscipline horses, regularly shod/trimmed every 6 weeks, were assessed. Tuber coxae heights were measured in triplicate from the dorsal aspect to ground level, with the horse standing square, using a plumb line and measuring stick. Difference between means indicated value and direction of pelvic misalignment. Using a 300?mm digital vernier calliper, triplicate measurements of hoof width (lateral to medial edge) and hoof length (dorsal to palmar edge) were made of both fore-feet, prior to and after farrier trimming, and were obtained by the farrier (blinded to pelvic measurements) at two shoeing intervals 6 weeks apart. Both methods were tested for reliability and repeatability to ±?1?mm. Statistical analyses included Chi-square, symmetry indices and one-way ANOVA. Results Ventral pelvic rotation was related to greater growth in hoof width on the contralateral forelimb and greater growth in hoof length on the ipsilateral forelimb. There was a significant relationship between uneven hoof width and pelvic rotation direction (P?=?0.0002), and a significant relationship between uneven hoof length and pelvic rotation directional (P?=?6.1?x?10-7). There was a significant relationship between amount of growth in hoof width (P?=?0.0002) and hoof length (P?=?4.8?x?10-6) with pelvic misalignment. Conclusions This study provides evidence of a statistically significant relationship between the alignment of the pelvis and growth of horse's front hooves. Further study would be beneficial in enhancing understanding of the chain of compensatory effects on the equine body.

AB  - Introduction Advances in close-range photogrammetry offer an option for high accuracy measurements of the equine hoof. Automatic camera calibration using coded targets, image matching and triangulation enables 3D model reconstruction from photographs. This study aimed to identify an accurate photogrammetric method to measure proximal hoof circumference (PHC). PHC is currently measured by hand and shown to change in racehorses during training. Methods A cadaver hoof was measured by hand, photographed, and laser scanned for method comparison. Then, the left front hooves of two adult horses were photographed under two treatments (exercise and control). Exercise involved 5 minutes brisk trot counter-clockwise on a lunge-line. During both experiments a Canon 40D camera (28?135?mm lens; F5 aperture; 1/60?sec shutter speed) was used. Hooves were marked with permanent marker and coded targets placed on the ground around the hoof for automatic point identification. Photos were taken from 10?16 different locations around the hoof. A paired t-test was used for comparisons and significance set at P<0.05. Results Photogrammetry produced a 3D model of the cadaver hoof which was considered good (accuracy of 0.25 pixel RMS). Points on the hoof were manually identified and model creation took 1.5 hours. PHC measurements from photogrammetry differed from the laser scan by 1.25?mm and from hand measurements by 1.73?mm. PHC decreased following exercise (0.8?mm; p?=?0.25). Conclusions Close-range photogrammetry could be viable for highly accurate and quick measurements of hoof shape. Advantages include; ease of data acquisition, flexibility, low cost, evaluation of the loaded hoof, and high geometric accuracy. To measure only PHC eight images or less could be used. Additional research is required to determine repeatability and accuracy. Ethical Animal Research Procedures were approved by the University of Melbourne's Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee.

AB  - Introduction Lower airway diseases are common problems in sports and racing horses. In humans, exercise causes increased susceptibility to respiratory infections associated with down-regulated expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), co-stimulatory and antigen-presenting molecules. Because numerous cell types are implicated in important defense mechanisms against airborne infections, we aimed to assess the effect of training on innate immune responses of pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM), equine bronchial epithelial cells (EBEC) and blood monocytes. Methods PAM, EBEC and monocytes were collected at rest and after a standardized exercise test (SET) from eight untrained, trained and deconditioned horses. We compared their respective expression of TLR1-9 by qPCR and their cytokinic responses following exposure to various TLR ligands by ELISA. Data were reported as least square means and analyzed by a global linear mixed model. Results The mRNA expression of TLR3 was down-regulated by training in PAM (P<0.0001) and monocytes (P<0.015), whereas the mRNA expression of TLR4 was up-regulated in monocytes (P?=?0.0004) only. Monocytes stimulated with TLR2- and TLR4-ligands showed increased cytokine secretion after training and deconditioning (P<0.025). EBEC from trained horses produced less TNF-alpha (P<0.05) after treatment with ligands of TLR2 and TLR3 compared with EBEC from untrained horses. The production of TNF-alpha (P<0.001) and IFN-beta (P<0.001) in non-stimulated and stimulated PAM was decreased in trained and deconditioned horses. Conclusions The impaired cytokine production in PAM and EBEC after a training period might explain the increased susceptibility to respiratory viral infections and is associated with the activation of cells at the systemic level.

AB  - Introduction The aims of the study were to monitor fitness level of young Friesian horses and to assess whether fitness data has a predictive value for the final performance score and whether familial aggregation of response to training could be detected. Methods Sixty-six young Friesian horses, offspring of six different stallions (A, B, C, D, E and F), underwent a 7-week performance test. Horses were given a performance score for their dressage ability (0?110 points), and fitness was evaluated with standardised-exercise-tests (SET) at the beginning (SET-I) and the end (SET-II) of the period. Heart rate (HR; beats/min) was measured in both SET, and plasma lactate concentration (LA; mmol/L) was measured only in SET-II. The majority of data were analyzed with an ANOVA-test or a linear-model (P<0.05). Results Fitness of horses improved significantly between SET-I and II (P?=?0.015). There was a large heterogeneity in responsiveness to training; some horses were high-responders, whereas others were non- or low-responders. There was a familial aggregation of HRcanter-1 response to training (P?=?0.039); offspring of stallion C decreased significantly more in HR than offspring of stallions A (P?=?0.09), D (P?=?0.013) and F (P?=?0.009). HR had no predictive value for the performance score, but horses that did not reach the anaerobic threshold in SET-II scored significantly better (73.8?±?5.6 points) than horses that did (69.9?±?5.9 points, P?=?0.025). Conclusions The present study reports, for the first time in the horse, familial aggregation of HR-response to training. HR could not predict final performance score, but LA-concentrations during SET-II were predictive. Ethical Animal Research Consent was obtained from the owners of all horses.

AB  - Introduction The objective of this study was to determine if yearlings would have higher oxidative stress and lower antioxidant status than mature mares after a single bout of intense exercise before and after training. Methods Seven Standardbred yearling fillies (18?±?2.4?mo) and seven mares (13?±?2.1?yr) ran a repeated sprints exercise test before (RSET1) and after (RSET2) an 8-wk training protocol. Blood samples and middle gluteal muscle samples were taken before and after exercise, and throughout recovery. Data is presented as mean?±?SE and all analyses were done in the context of a linear mixed model with random intercepts for horse. Results In RSET1, mares had higher plasma malondialdehyde than the yearlings (P<0.05), but the yearlings had higher muscle malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, glutathione and glutathione peroxidase, erythrocyte total glutathione and glutathione peroxidase (P<0.05). In RSET2, yearlings had higher plasma nitric oxide than the mares (P<0.05). In RSET2, the mares had lower plasma malondialdehyde, and higher muscle malondialdehyde, total glutathione and nitric oxide as compared to RSET1 (P<0.05). The yearlings in RSET2 had higher muscle nitric oxide and lower erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase than in RSET1 (P<0.05). Plasma cortisol, creatine kinase and muscle glutathione peroxidase had little difference with age or training. Conclusions Prior to training, the yearlings had lower lipid peroxidation and higher antioxidants than the mares. Training reduced oxidative stress and improved antioxidant status in the mares, while few effects of training were seen in the yearlings. This suggests that age is an important defense against exercise-induced oxidative stress. Ethical Animal Research Rutgers University Institutional Animal Care and Use Review Board approved the study.

AB  - Introduction In equestrian sports where horses exercise at submaximal levels, the identification of some clinical conditions leading to poor performance can remain difficult. The aim of this study was to design a graded exercise test, applicable in the field and to test the hypothesis that measured heart rate (HR) and lactate (LA) differ between healthy and subclinically-affected horses, according to diagnosis. Methods Fifty-four sport horses regularly participating in competitions were studied. A total of 106 examinations were performed, 85 were poor performance investigations (PP) and 21 were controls (C) in healthy performing individuals. The exercise test consisted of 4 consecutive 2-minute steps, 2 at trot and 2 at canter. Heart rate (HR), ECG and lactate (LA) were recorded. Blood samples, tracheal wash and bronchoalveolar lavage were systematically collected. Other examinations were performed when indicated. Differences in HR and LA between groups were compared using an ANOVA. Repeatability was checked in 12 horses. Results Tests were highly reproducible. Diagnoses included upper (15%) and lower (48%) respiratory, cardiac (12%), locomotor (25%), and muscular (17%) disorders. Although horses did not systematically exceed the lactate threshold, HR and LA at steps 2, 3 and 4 and recovery HR differed significantly between groups (P<0.001?0.03). The rate of increase in LA and HR varied according to diagnosis, with LA reaching significantly higher values in horses affected with cardio-respiratory conditions. Conclusions Field exercise testing in sport horses during the competitive season is a simple procedure that allows an objective measurement of the horse's capacity to exercise. The analysis of HR and LA provides indications for specific diagnostic examinations and helps assess the functional impairment caused by subclinical disease. Ethical Animal Research This study was based on clinical cases referred to the Equine Sports Medicine Practice. Horse owners referred their horses and consented to all procedures described.

AB  - Introduction Arabian horses have the best records in long distance endurance racing (80?160?km). The endurance horses are interesting models to calculate the heritability (h2) of exercise ability. Heritability indicates the percentage of trait transmitted by parents to their descendants (h2?=?Genetic variance/Total variance). In human athletes, heritability of physiological traits calculated using twin design were 0.12, 0.72 and 0.32 for VO2max, Heart Rate max and endurance capacity respectively. Heritabilities of 0.28 and 0.06 for speed and placing respectively are reported in endurance horses. The aim of this study was to calculate the heritability of recovery heart rate, cardiac recovery time and average speed in long distance endurance racing. Methods The results of 132 endurance races (80?160?km) from 2007 to 2011 were analyzed. The database included 4421 horses of known pedigrees representing 655 sires with a mean of 18.5 products per sire. The data were analyzed using Restricted Estimator of Maximal Likelihood (REML, VCE6) method with animal mixed model including country, ride distance, age, gender, common environment as fixed effects and animal genetic as random effect. Results Heritabilities (SE) were 0.12 (0.06), 0.15 (0.02) and 0.46 (0.08) for speed, recovery heart rate and cardiac recovery time respectively. Conclusions The speed and heart rate recovery seem more influenced by training and environmental effects than the cardiac recovery time which is more influenced by genetics. This high heritability is consistent with heritability of V200 found in French Trotter population previously and may indicate a putative quantitative trait linkage.

AB  - Introduction The Brazilian sport horse (BH) was specifically developed for jumping competition. Monocarboxylate transporters are key regulators of cell pH and therefore facilitate co-transport of protons and lactate. Lactate transport in red blood cells (RBCs) is bimodal (high [HT] and low transport [LT]) and is related to CD147 levels. This study aimed to quantify MCT1 and CD147 protein levels in BH after an incremental jumping test (IJT). Methods Sixteen horses were distributed into two groups: low-level jumpers (LL, n?=?8), able to jump up to 1.00?m, and high-level jumpers (HL, n?=?8), able to jump up to 1.20?m. The IJT consisted of three steps, each with forty jumps at increasing heights (0.40, 0.60, and 0.80?m). Blood samples were collected before and after the IJT. The YSI 2300 method was used to determine plasma lactate concentration [Lac]p. RBC membranes were purified, and MCT1 and CD147 levels were measured by Western blotting. A Student's t-test and Pearson's correlation (P<0.05) were employed. Results The HL group displayed lower [Lac]p, indicating prevalence of the aerobic pathway in this group. The results showed no difference in the expression of the transporters between times or groups and a positive correlation (r?=?0.67, P<0.0001) between MCT1 and CD147. In both groups [Lac]p didn't correlate with the amount of MCT1 or CD147. Most of the horses appeared to have high lactate transport activity. The CD147/MCT1 ratios for LL and HL were equal. Conclusions BH showed no difference in MCT1 and CD147 expression between conditioning levels.

AB  - Introduction Biochemical and hemogasometric parameters have been used to evaluate equine performance. This study evaluated blood biochemical and hemogasometry variables of horses during incremental jumping and speed tests. Methods Eighteen horses performed a jumping test with four steps over a vertical obstacle of 1.10?m height (10, 15, 20 and 25 jumps, respectively) totaling 70 jumps, and a speed test with six steps of one minute each with increasing speed from 2 to 8?m/s. Blood samples were collected before and immediately after each test to determine plasma lactate, hematocrit, total plasma protein, glucose, uric acid and hemogasometry variables. Results were analysed by ANOVA and compared by 5% Tukey test. Results Immediately after tests the hematocrit and total plasma protein decreased from 52.4% to 38.9%, and from 7.2 to 6.7?g/dl respectively, and the glucose increased from 98.3 to 109.8?mg/dl (P<0.05). The lactate and uric acid concentrations were higher with speed testing (7.97?±?4.8?mmol/l and 1.33?±?0.8?mg/dl respectively) than jumping testing (3.92?±?3.0?mmol/l and 1.24?±?0.9?mg/dl respectively). The blood pH was lower after speed testing (7.36?±?0.1) than the jumping test (7.40?±?0.04) (P<0.05). Blood pCO2, Na and K concentrations increased more after the speed test (53.38?±?7.3?mmHg/l; 139?±?3.0?mEq/l; 4.7?±?0.8?mEq/l respectively) than after the jumping test (49.34?±?3.2?mmHg/l; 138.3?±?2.3?mEq/l; 4.51?±?0.6?mEq/l respectively) (P<0.05). Blood pO2 was not different among tests (P>0.05). Conclusions Incremental jumping and velocity tests are useful tools for assessing performance of jumping horses. Differences among tests could evidence a smaller anaerobic contribution during jumping test.

AB  - Introduction In theory, splenic reserve mobilization should elicit a cardiopulmonary baroreceptor mediated neuroendocrine response (the Gauer-Henry reflex). Six intact (IN) and 5 (SP) splenectomized Standardbred mares (421?491?kg, ?9?yr) performed 10?min of treadmill exercise (80% VO2max) to test the hypothesis that hemodynamic and endocrine responses to exercise would differ between IN and SP horses Methods Blood samples were obtained before and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10?min of exertion. Right ventricular pressure (RVP), right atrial pressure (RAP), arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and cardiac output (CO) were measured and total peripheral resistance (TPR) calculated. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and vasopressin (AVP) concentrations were measured using RIA. Data analysis used ANOVA for repeated measures and SNK. Significance was set at P<0.05. There were no differences (P>0.05) between IN and SP for any variable at rest. All variables except TPR and RAP increased (P<0.05) during exertion in both IN and SP. Means (±SE) for RAP (18?±?3 vs. 1?±?2?mmHg), CO (255?±?21 vs.177?±?19?L/min), MAP (147?±?3 vs. 116?±?8?mmHg), and ANP (66?±?3 vs. 50?±?8?pg/mL) were greater for IN vs. SP horses at 10?min of exertion. Mean plasma AVP (95?±?19 vs. 23?±?3?pg/mL) was greater (P<0.05) for SP than for IN horses at 10?min of exertion. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

AB  - Introduction The Brazilian Mangalarga Marchador breed is valued for its gait. However few studies have assessed the use of nutritional additives on this breed's performance. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that chelated trivalent chromium and L-carnitine feed supplementation may reduce subcutaneous fat deposition after training. Methods 13 mares (2.5 to 3 years old) were assigned to one of three treatments (T1, 10?mg Cr/day; T2, 10?g LCN/day; T3, control) according to a completely randomized design, with split-plot arrangement. The diet was Panicum maximum cv. Massai and concentrate (50:50 ratio and 2.5% BWT). During 42 days the mares received supplementation and exercised for 50?min on a treadmill and 60?min on an automatic walker every other day, resting on Sundays. Subcutaneous fat was measured with ultrasound before and after training in the back-loin(GDL), croup(GG), and base of the tail(GBC). Results were compared by Tukey test (P<0.05). Results Before training, the variables were similar across the groups (P>0.05). After training, in GDL, T2 (1.76?mm) was 37.37% lower (P<0.05) than control (2.81?mm), while T1 (2.22?mm) was similar to T2 and control. There was no difference between treatments (P>0.05) in GG. In GBC, there was a 24.45% increase from pre (8.59?mm) to post-treatment (10.69?mm) evaluations, regardless of the treatment. Conclusions Supplementation with L-carnitine reduces subcutaneous fat deposition in the lumbar region of Mangalarga Marchador mares after training, which may be indicative of increased use of subcutaneous fat in this region as a substrate for exercise.

AB  - Introduction Horses are usually transported before competitions. The aim of this study was to compare the lactate response in horses on two diets that were transported or not transported before exercise. Methods Six trained and raced Standardbred trotter mares, all accustomed to transportation, were used. Two diets were fed in two periods of 29 days in a crossover design; one forage-only diet (F) and one diet with 50% of DM intake from forage and 50% from oats (FO). The horses had slow exercise 1?3 times/week (approximately 1?h walk and slow trot [6?7?m/s]) and intensive exercise1?2 times/week (4000?m slow trot warm-up, 2000?m at 10?11?m/s on a race track or five 500?m intervals at 9?m/s on a slope, slow trot downhill). At day 21, horses were subjected to transport for 100 kilometres before they performed an exercise test (TT) (4000 meter warm-up [6.3?10?m/s] and 2140?m ?race? [11.6?12.7?m/s]). At day 26, the horses performed a control test (CT) where they were kept in their stall before the exercise test was performed. Blood samples were collected after the finish line and 10 and 30?min post-exercise. Plasma lactate (Lac) was analysed using a spectrophometric method. ANOVA was performed using PROC MIXED (significant difference P<0.05). Results There was no difference in Lac (after finish and 10 and 30?min post-exercise) between diets (F: 14.9 vs. FO: 17.1?mmol/l SEM: 2.1) or exercise tests (TT: 15.9 vs. CT: 16.1?mmol/l SEM 2.0). Conclusions Diet and transport seem not to affect post-exercise plasma lactate in experienced competition horses transported 100?km.
