AB  - Introduction High concentrate diets increase the risk of several health problems and high energy forage diets could therefore be an alternative. The aim of this study was to compare the number of horses and the number of races performed at the age of three by a group of 16 Standardbred horses fed a forage only-diet from the age of 1.5 years (F) with the results of their siblings (S). Methods To F-horses, a forage diet was offered ad libitum (10.2?11.7?MJ metabolisable energy, 10?16% crude protein/kg dry matter) and supplemented daily with minerals and vitamins to meet requirements. F-horses were trained by pupils at the National Trotting School during supervision of professional trainers. For each individual in the F-group, the mean racing results from a maximum of five older siblings (same mother) were used for the S-group (5 siblings, n?=?9; 4-3 siblings, n?=?4 and 1?2 siblings, n?=?3). The siblings selected were born closest in time in relation to the F individual. S-horses were trained by different trainers and it was assumed that they had been fed a conventional high concentrate diet. Racing results were obtained from the Swedish Trotting Association. ANOVA and a Tukey test were used to analyse differences between groups. Results There was no difference in the number of horses that competed (F: 56% vs S: 54%, SE 10) and in the number of races performed (F: 1.6 vs S: 2.9, SE 0.5). Conclusions The study indicates that a forage-only diet may not be a limitation to achieve conventional training results and could therefore be an alternative to conventional diets. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the local ethics committee in Umeå, Sweden.

AB  - Introduction Marcha is typically a low intensity/medium duration exercise that has the potential to induce oxidative stress. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that supplementation with oil would alter biomarkers of oxidative stress in four-beat gaited horses during marcha training. Methods Eleven gaited horses underwent training for 60?min (?60% consisting of marcha at ?3.5?m/s) 3?d/wk for eight weeks. Subjects were fed elephant grass (?15?kg/day) and concentrate (?5?kg/day). They were also supplemented with 300?mL of oil per os (vitamin E: 300?IU/kg, omega-3: 300?g/kg; omega-6: 80?g/kg) and had free access to water and salt. Blood samples were collected before and after four and eight weeks of supplementation for the measurement of GPx, SOD, RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, WBC, TPP, urea, creatinine and uric acid. ANOVA and Tukey tests were used for statistical analysis (P<0.05). Results Increases in GPx (?12%), SOD (?51%) and uric acid (?19%) were observed after 8 week of supplementation (P<0.05). There were changes (P<0.05) in [urea] and [creatinine]; however, there were no changes (P>0.05) in RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit or WBC. Published research has demonstrated that administration of supplements with antioxidants enhances the antioxidant system and protects against oxidative stress during exercise. Supplementation with oil, rich in vitamin E, omega-3 and -6, produced a beneficial increase in antioxidant capacity in gaited horses during training. Conclusions The elevation in [GPx], [SOD] and [uric acid] in the present study offers a strategy to counterbalance the physiologic processes that overwhelm endogenous antioxidants during training.

AB  - Background and Objectives We have developed a light-activated technology for rapidly sealing skin surgical wounds called photochemical tissue bonding (PTB). The goals of this study were to evaluate parameters influencing PTB in order to optimize its clinical efficacy and to determine whether PTB can be used to seal wounds in moderately to highly pigmented skin. Study Design/Materials and Methods Application of Rose Bengal (RB) followed by exposure to 532?nm was used to seal linear incisions (1.5?mm deep, 2?cm long) in lightly pigmented (Yorkshire) and darkly pigmented (Yucatan) swine skin. The force required to open the seal (the bonding strength) was measured by in situ tensiometry. Reflectance spectra, epidermal transmission spectra, and histology were used to characterize the skin. The relationships of RB concentration and fluence to bonding strength were established in Yorkshire skin. Surface temperature was measured during irradiations and cooling was used while sealing incisions in Yucatan skin. Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to estimate the effect of epidermal melanin on the power absorbed in the dermis at the incision interface. Results The lowest fluence, 25?J/cm2, delivered at an irradiance of 0.5?W/cm2 substantially increased the bonding strength (?10-fold) compared to controls in Yorkshire swine skin. Increasing the fluence to 100?J/cm2 enhanced bonding strength by a further 1.5-fold. Application of 0.1% RB for 2?minutes produced the greatest bonding strength using 100?J/cm2 and limited the penetration of RB to an ?50??m band on the dermal incision wall. Reflectance spectra indicated that Yorkshire skin had minimal melanin and that Yucatan skin was a good model for highly pigmented human skin. In Yucatan skin, the bonding strength increased 1.7-fold using 0.1% RB and 200?J/cm2 at 1.5?W/cm2 with cooling and epinephrine. Monte Carlo simulation indicated that absorption of 532?nm light by epidermal melanin in dark skin decreased the power absorbed along the incision in the dermis by a factor of 2.7. Conclusions These results suggest that in lightly pigmented skin the PTB treatment time can be shortened without compromising the bonding strength. Sealing incisions using PTB in moderately and highly pigmented skin will require a careful balance of irradiance and cooling. Lasers Surg. Med. 47:17?29, 2015. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Following traumatic brain injury (TBI), there is significant secondary damage to cerebral tissue from increased free radicals and impaired mitochondrial function. This imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the effectiveness of cellular antioxidant defenses is termed oxidative stress. Often there are insufficient antioxidants to scavenge ROS, leading to alterations in cerebral structure and function. Attenuating oxidative stress following a TBI by administering an antioxidant may decrease secondary brain injury, and currently many drugs and supplements are being investigated. We explored an over-the-counter supplement called ubiquinol (reduced form of coenzyme Q10), a potent antioxidant naturally produced in brain mitochondria. We administered intra-arterial ubiquinol to rats to determine if it would reduce mitochondrial damage, apoptosis, and severity of a contusive TBI. Adult male F344 rats were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) Saline-TBI, (2) ubiquinol 30 minutes before TBI (UB-PreTBI), or (3) ubiquinol 30 minutes after TBI (UB-PostTBI). We found when ubiquinol was administered before or after TBI, rats had an acute reduction in brain mitochondrial damage, apoptosis, and two serum biomarkers of TBI severity, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1). However, in vivo neurometabolic assessment with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy did not show attenuated injury-induced changes. These findings are the first to show that ubiquinol preserves mitochondria and reduces cellular injury severity after TBI, and support further study of ubiquinol as a promising adjunct therapy for TBI.

AB  - A 42 year old man was referred to the Contact Dermatitis Investigation Unit because of a 12 month history of an inflammatory eruption affecting his neck. He was patch tested to our standard series, textile series and his own medicaments. At the 48 hour reading the patches were removed and there were large areas of unusual painful superficial erosions where the patch test tape ? Scanporä had been in contact with the skin. This appearance was difficult to explain. He denied interfering with the patches. The erosions were dressed with non-adherent dressings held in place by a different tape- Microporeä. At the 96 hour reading these dressings were removed and in the areas under the Microporeä tape there were further erosions around the edge and also some thin walled vesicles and small bullae. There were ++ allergic reactions to sodium metabisulphite, disperse blue 35, 124 and 106 all of which were felt to be relevant as he had used Trimovateâ cream and regularly wore dark nylon clothing when refereeing lacrosse matches. A biopsy was taken for histology and immunofluorescence from an area of blistering. This demonstrated suprabasal acantholysis with vesicle formation. There were occasional corps ronds. The immunofluorescence was negative. Anti-epidermal (skin) antibodieswere also negative. This striking and alarming clinical presentation after removal of patch tests had been encountered once previously in our Contact Dermatitis Investigation Unit. The possibility that the disorder was artefactual either due to an irritant introduced under the tapes or perhaps due to a contaminant within the tape adhesive was considered but no conclusion was reached In this case the clue to diagnosis became apparent at the second patch test reading when small vesicles and bullae could be seen at the edge of where the Microporeâ had been. A diagnosis of Hailey Hailey disease (HHD) trigered by the trauma caused by the adhesive tapes and their removal was made. The relatively persistent nature of his presenting problem makes Grover?s disease less likely. The affected sites healed after two weeks. Allergic contact dermatitis particularly to medicaments is reported to be a frequent complication and routine patch testing has been advocated1. There has been a previous report of blistering at the site of patch testing however he was an individual already known to have HHD2. Despite having patch tested around 30 000 people in the last 22 years this complication had not been encountered until this year. We present this case whose clinical features are distinctive as we feel similar instances may have been or will be seen by colleagues. Diagnosis may be difficult if there are no blisters in association with the painful erosions.

AB  - Contents Sheep and goat production is an important economic activity in Spain with an increasing interest in milk production. Multiovulation and Embryo Transfer (MOET) and In vitro Embryo Production (IVEP) are assisted reproductive technologies aimed at increasing the genetic diffusion of females. In vitro embryo production is a multi-step methodology comprising the following procedures: (i) In vitro Maturation (IVM) of oocytes recovered directly from the follicles, (ii) In vitro Fertilization (IVF) or co-incubation of capacitated spermatozoa with in vitro matured oocytes and (iii) In vitro culture (IVC) of zygotes up to the blastocyst stage. In vitro embryo production from oocytes recovered from prepubertal females is called JIVET (Juvenile in vitro Embryo Transfer) and allows shortened generation intervals and increased genetic gain. Embryo production together with embryo cryoconservation would allow large-scale embryo marketing, a pathogen-free genetic movement and easier and cheaper germplasm commercial transactions. Commercial Embryo activity in small ruminants is low compared to cows in the European Union (data from the European Embryo Transfer Association) and in the world (data from the International Embryo Transfer Association). There is less IVEP research in small ruminants compared to other livestock species. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of the current status of IVEP of small ruminant with an emphasis on (i) description of the main methodologies currently used for IVM, IVF and IVC of embryos (ii) comparing procedures and outputs from JIVET and IVEP of adult females and (iii) the future research perspectives of this technology.

Methods An approach for ex vivo MR volumetry of human brain hemispheres was developed. Five hemispheres from elderly subjects were imaged ex vivo longitudinally. All datasets were segmented. The longitudinal behavior of volumes measured ex vivo was assessed. The relationship between in vivo and ex vivo volumetric measurements was investigated in seven elderly subjects imaged both antemortem and postmortem. Results This approach for ex vivo MR volumetry did not contaminate the results of histopathological examination. For a period of 6 months postmortem, within-subject volume variation across time points was substantially smaller than intersubject volume variation. A close linear correspondence was detected between in vivo and ex vivo volumetric measurements. Conclusion Regional brain volumes measured with this approach for ex vivo MR volumetry remain relatively unchanged for a period of 6 months postmortem. Furthermore, the linear relationship between in vivo and ex vivo MR volumetric measurements suggests that this approach captures information linked to antemortem macrostructural brain characteristics.

AB  - Summary The preparation, properties, and applications of shape memory polymer (SMP) systems composed of or containing biodegradable polyesters have been surveyed in this chapter. SMPs are capable of memorizing one or more temporary shapes and recovering to the permanent shape upon an external stimulus that is usually heat. SMPs were classified with respect to their molecular structure (homopolymers, copolymers, blends) and architecture (conetwork, interpenetrating network) in this review. A further distinction was made as to whether the related system was linear (thermoplastic) or cross-linked (thermoset). The underlying mechanisms of shape memory actions are introduced and discussed. Emphasis has been placed on presenting recent progress on shape memory biodegradable polyester systems and their potential for practical applications, especially in surgery. An attempt has been made to deduce the trends for future developments and applications.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic spinal cord injury is characterized by an immediate, irreversible loss of tissue at the lesion site, as well as a secondary expansion of tissue damage over time. Although secondary injury should, in principle, be preventable, no effective treatment options currently exist for patients with acute spinal cord injury (SCI). Excessive release of ATP by the traumatized tissue, triggers the rapid release of arachidonic acid (AA) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and has beenimplicated in acute and chronic neuropathic pain and inflammation. But the intracellular pathways between ATP and PGE2 remain largely unknown. We have explored the signaling events involved in this synthesis by primarily culturing spinal cord astrocytes: (1) we determined significant PGE2 production increased by ATP is mainly via Subtype 1 of P2 purinoceptors (P2Y1) but not P2Y2; (2) we found that ATP strongly increased the level of intracellular Ca2+ via P2Y1 receptor; (3) we indicated that ATP stimulates the definitely release of AA and PGE2 which involved the transactivation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, the phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and the activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2); (4) we examined ATP could increase the phosphorylation of Akt via P2Y1 receptor which also depend on the transactivation of EGFR, but the activation of Akt has no effect on the downstream of cPLA2 phosphorylation. ATP induced by SCI could mobilize the release of AA and PGE2. And inhibition of PGE2 release reduces behavioral signs of pain after SCI and peripheral nerve injury. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract. Purpose:? Ocular surface reconstruction with cultivated oral mucosal epithelial transplantation technique is a viable treatment option for severe ocular surface injuries and diseases with limbal stem cell deficiency. Currently, this technique is based on utilization of xenogenic, allogenic or undefined components such as murine 3T3 feeders, serum and amniotic membrane. In this study, we aimed to find a more defined culture method to generate stratified human oral mucosal epithelium. Methods:? In this study, we have examined the formation of stratified cell sheets from human oral mucosal epithelial cells under serum-free culture environment both in the absence and presence of fibroblast-conditioned culture medium and elevated epidermal growth factor (EGF) concentration. Results:? In all examined culture conditions, the cultivated oral epithelial cells formed a stratified tissue, which was positive for keratins K3/12, K4 and K13. The tissue-engineered oral epithelia also expressed proliferation and progenitor markers Ki67 and p63 in the basal layer of the cell sheets, suggesting that the epithelia still had regenerative capacity. The cultures presented expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin and high transepithelial electrical resistance values. Conclusion:? In this culture method, we have been able to produce stratified cell sheets successfully without serum, conditioning of the medium or increased EGF concentration. We provide a novel protocol to produce tight multi-layered epithelium with proliferative potential, which can be easily adapted for cultivated oral mucosal epithelial transplantation.

AB  - Natural hydrogels have been investigated for three-dimensional tissue reconstruction and regeneration given their ability to emulate the structural complexity of multi-component extracellular matrices (ECM). Hydrogels rich in ECM can be extracted and assembled from soft tissues, retain a composition specific to the tissue source, and stimulate vascularized tissue formation. However, poor mechanical properties and rapid degradation hinder their performance in regenerative applications. This study investigates the effect of glutaraldehyde (GA) crosslinking on the mechanical properties, biological activity, and degradation of dermis-isolated ECM-rich hydrogels. Compression tests indicated that hydrogel elastic moduli and yield stress values increased significantly with GA exposure time. Lyophilization was shown to decrease yield stress values with respect to non-lyophilized gels. Crosslinked ECM, unlike non-crosslinked gels, was resistant to pepsin degradation in vitro. In a rodent subcutaneous implant model, crosslinking for 0.5 hours or longer drastically slowed degradation relative to controls. Inflammation was low and mature vascularized granulation tissue was observed in all gels, with an increase in vessel density at 1 week in crosslinked gels relative to controls. These results support the potential use of dermis-derived hydrogels as materials for tissue engineering applications and suggest that crosslinking can enhance mechanical properties and prolong hydrogel lifetime while promoting vascularized tissue formation. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Esterified hyaluronan scaffolds offer significant advantages for tissue engineering. They are recognized by cellular receptors, interact with many other extracellular matrix proteins and their metabolism is mediated by intrinsic cellular pathways. In this study differences in the viability and structural integrity of vascular tissue models cultured on hyaluronan scaffolds under laminar flow conditions highlighted potential differences in the biodegradation kinetics, processes and end-products, depending on the culture environment. Critical factors are likely to include seeding densities and the duration and magnitude of applied biomechanical stress. Proteomic evaluation of the timing and amount of remodelling protein expression, the resulting biomechanical changes arising from this response and metabolic cell viability assay, together with examination of tissue morphology, were conducted in vascular tissue models cultured on esterified hyaluronan felt and PTFE mesh scaffolds. The vascular tissue models were derived using complete cell sheets derived from harvested and expanded umbilical cord vein cells. This seeding method utilizes high-density cell populations from the outset, while the cells are already supported by their own abundant extracellular matrix. Type I and type IV collagen expression in parallel with MMP-1 and MMP-2 expression were monitored in the tissue models over a 10 day culture period under laminar flow regimes using protein immobilization technologies. Uniaxial tensile testing and scanning electron microscopy were used to compare the resulting effects of hydrodynamic stimulation upon structural integrity, while viability assays were conducted to evaluate the effects of shear on metabolic function. The proteomic results showed that the hyaluronan felt-supported tissues expressed higher levels of all remodelling proteins than those cultured on PTFE mesh. Overall, a 21% greater expression of type I collagen, 24% higher levels of type IV collagen, 24% higher levels of MMP-1 and 34% more MMP-2 were observed during hydrodynamic stress. This was coupled with a loss of structural integrity in these models after the introduction of laminar flow, as compared to the increases in all mechanical properties observed in the PTFE mesh-supported tissues. However, under flow conditions, the hyaluronan-supported tissues showed some recovery of the viability originally lost during static culture conditions, in contrast to PTFE mesh-based models, where initial gains were followed by a decline in metabolic viability after applied shear stress. Proteomic, cell viability and mechanical testing data emphasized the need for extended in vitro evaluations to enable better understanding of multi-stage remodelling and reparative processes in tissues cultured on biodegradable scaffolds. This study also highlighted the possibility that in high-density tissue culture with a biodegradable component, dynamic conditions may be more conducive to optimal tissue development than the static environment because they facilitate the efficient removal of high concentrations of degradation end-products accumulating in the pericellular space.

AB  - Abstract Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) is a potent superantigen produced by Staphylococcus aureus that triggers a strong immune response, characterized by cytokine storm, multi-organ failure, and often death. When inhaled, SEB can cause acute lung injury (ALI) and respiratory failure. In this study, we investigated the effect of resveratrol (RES), a phytoallexin, on SEB-driven ALI and mortality in mice. We used a dual-exposure model of SEB in C3H/HeJ mice, which caused 100% mortality within the first 5 days of exposure, and treatment with RES resulted in 100% survival of these mice up to 10 days post-SEB exposure. RES reduced the inflammatory cytokines in the serum and lungs, as well as T cell infiltration into the lungs caused by SEB. Treatment with RES also caused increased production of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-?) in the blood and lungs. RES altered the miRNA profile in the immune cells isolated from the lungs. Of these, miR-193a was strongly induced by SEB and was down-regulated by RES treatment. Furthermore, transfection studies and pathway analyses revealed that miR-193a targeted several molecules involved in TGF-? signalling (TGF?2, TGF?R3) and activation of apoptotic pathways death receptor-6 (DR6). Together, our studies suggest that RES can effectively neutralize SEB-mediated lung injury and mortality through potential regulation of miRNA that promote anti-inflammatory activities.

AB  - Abstract Cardiolipin (CL) is a phospholipid that is almost exclusively located in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotic cells. As a result of its unique structure and distribution, CL establishes non-covalent bonds with a long list of proteins involved in ATP production, mitochondria biogenesis, mitophagy and apoptosis. Thus, the amount of CL, as well as its fatty acid composition and location, strongly impacts upon mitochondrial-dependent functions and therefore the metabolic homeostasis of different tissues. The brain is particularly sensitive to mitochondrial dysfunction as a result of its high metabolic demand. Several mitochondrial related-neurodegenerative disorders, as well as physiological ageing, show altered CL metabolism. Furthermore, mice lacking enzymes involved in CL synthesis show cognitive impairments. CL content and metabolism are regulated by gonadal hormones in the developing and adult brain. In neuronal cultures, oestradiol increases CL content, whereas adult ovariectomy decreases CL content and alters CL metabolism in the hippocampal mitochondria. Transient sex differences in brain CL metabolism have been detected during development. At birth, brain CL has a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in the brain of male mice than in the brain of females. In addition, the expression of enzymes involved in CL de novo and recycling synthetic pathways is higher in males. Most of these sex differences are abolished by the neonatal androgenisation of females, suggesting a role for testosterone in the generation of sex differences in brain CL. The regulation of brain CL by gonadal hormones may be linked to their homeostatic and protective actions in neural cells, as well as the manifestation of sex differences in neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Summary It would seem like stating the obvious to draw the following conclusions. 1 ?The eyes are not isolated organs, but rather they are very much an integral part of the total body system physiologically and immunologically. The inherent 2-way connections are seen in the general circulatory system and the 4 exit routes of drugs from the eye ? the conjunctiva, the iris, the tear and aqueous drainage systems (Holden 1973). This is significant in the context of the multi-factor-etiology (genetic, infection, hapten, cross-sensitization, acquired metabolic disorders, and the environmental elements) for the general and ocular allergies. Primary and secondary ocular allergies are but a few of the many other indicators which point to the departure from good general health of the patient. 2 ?In the affluent and industrial societies one of the common economic-socio-medical aspects of life is typified by the circular connection of these phenomena: the massive supply of diverse range of drugs, the medication-conscious public that demands and consumes more and more drugs, which are ?sometimes? unwittingly prescribed (Pennington 1973). Therefore among the many exogenous allergens both ophthalmic and systemic medicines are likely to play an increasingly dominant role either in cross sensitization or in various forms of haptens. 3 ?More immunologic and clinical data should be published in optometry's literature, so that the profession may be better informed on the indications for referal. The external eye, especially the conjunctiva tissue, like any other mucous membrane, is a vulnerable site for contact dermatitis. 4 ?The future ? optometry as one of the paramedical groups involved in community health care, should not be just an independent isolated profession, but should also be involved in multiprofessional communication. The vision of team-approach to public health, with optometry playing its unique role, such as early detection of ocular and some systemic pathologies, has been convincingly presented by Smith (1971). If Smith's enlightened ideal of mainstream public health prevails, optometry has no need to adopt a defensive attitude about being a relatively young profession; and ? in theory ? I see no reason why the older health professions should be hypersensitive about co-operating and communicating with optometry in the interest of the people and the society.

AB  - Objective To describe a case of diabetes mellitus in a koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). Design A case report with controls. Procedures We describe clinical and laboratory findings in a 6-year-old, free-living, female koala presented with traumatic injury and subsequently found to have polydipsia, hyperglycaemia and glucosuria. Over a 5 week period, serum biochemical analyses, haematological examinations, urinal-yses, measurement of serum insulin and fructosamine concentrations, necropsy, histopathological examination of a range of tissues and immunohistochemical examination of the pancreas for insulin-containing cells were done. For reference purposes, serum insulin and fructosamine concentrations were determined in four and two healthy koalas, respectively, and three healthy koalas pancreases were examined histo-logically and immunohistochemically. Results The koala had persistent hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia, hyponatraemia, hypochloraemia and glucosuria. Serum insulin concentration of the diabetic koala was only marginally smaller than that of healthy koalas, but all concentrations were smaller than reference concentrations in dogs and people. Fructosamine concentration did not allow the diabetic koala to be distinguished from healthy koalas and concentrations of all koala analytes were greater than expected for healthy dogs and people. Histopathological examination revealed extensive degeneration of pancreatic islet cells and fatty infiltration of hepatocytes. Immunoperoxidase staining revealed decreased or absent insulin in the b cells of the affected koala. Conclusion Clinical signs, clinicopathological results and histopathological changes were consistent with diabetes mellitus. The pathogenesis of the condition could not be determined but may have been related to the administration of a parenteral corticosteroid preparation, the stress of capture or tissue damage and inflammation.
