AB  - Hair and bone samples procured from the remains of Tycho Brahe were analysed by several analytical techniques. In segmented hair samples, concentrations of Fe, As, Ag and Au at the tips exceeded values for the contemporary population; however, they decreased towards the hair bulbs, similarly to Hg, indicating that recent exposure that was discontinued ~2?months prior to Brahe's death. Several other elements did not follow this pattern. Analyses of bones revealed signs of long-term exposure to Au, while many other elements were within expected ranges. Histopathological examination of bone sections yielded no signs of severe bone metabolic disorders.

AB  - Abstract Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has become a major disease that threatens human health. Neurotransmitters and the amygdala are found to be critical in the development and maintenance of PTSD. We aim to investigate the role of glycyrrhizin in treating PTSD. Contextual fear extinction and elevated plus maze test were applied to evaluate the anxiety and fear memory. Microdialysis and high-performance liquid chromatography were used to analyze the expression of amygdala neurotransmitters in PTSD animal models and to verify the effects of glycyrrhizin on major neurotransmitters. The protein levels of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) were examined by western bolt. Glycyrrhizin treatment significantly reduced anxiety and fear memory after 1 and 7 days of PTSD modelling. In addition, glycyrrhizin treatment restored the circadian rhythm changes of serotonin and TPH2. The present study found a significant circadian rhythm change of serotonin in the amygdala in PTSD rats. Besides, glycyrrhizin treatment restored the altered serotonin diurnal fluctuations, which raises important implications for PTSD treatment.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) are a very attractive tool in the context of repair and regeneration of musculoskeletal tissue damaged by trauma. The most common source of MPCs to date has been the bone marrow, but aspirating bone marrow from the patient is an invasive procedure. In an attempt to search for alternative sources of MPCs that could be obtained with minimal invasion, we looked into traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee. In this study, we determined whether a population of multipotent MPCs could be isolated from acute traumatic knee hemarthrosis in the absence of intra-articular fractures. Mononuclear cells were isolated from the aspirated hemarthrosis by density gradient separation, and cultured. We were able to obtain plastic adherent fibroblast-like cells from the mononuclear cell fractions. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the adherent fibroblast-like cells were consistently positive for CD29, CD44, CD105, and CD166, and were negative for CD14, CD34, and CD45. These were similar to control bone marrow stromal cells. These cells could differentiate in vitro into osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic cells in the presence of lineage-specific induction factors. In conclusion, acute unfractured traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee contains MPCs with multipotentiality. Because knee hemarthrosis is easy to harvest with minimal pain and without unnecessary invasion, we regard hemarthrosis-derived cells as an additional progenitor cell source for future tissue engineering and cell-based therapy in knee injuries.

AB  - Rationale Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Understanding the recovery process post-stroke is essential; however, longer-term recovery studies are lacking. In vivo positron emission tomography (PET) can image biological recovery processes, but is limited by spatial resolution and its targeted nature. Untargeted mass spectrometry imaging offers high spatial resolution, providing an ideal ex vivo tool for brain recovery imaging. Methods Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to image a rat brain 48 h after ischaemic stroke to locate the infarcted regions of the brain. PET was carried out 3 months post-stroke using the tracers [18F]DPA-714 for TSPO and [18F]IAM6067 for sigma-1 receptors to image neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, respectively. The rat brain was flash-frozen immediately after PET scanning, and sectioned for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) imaging. Results Three months post-stroke, PET imaging shows minimal detection of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, indicating that the brain has stabilised. However, MALDI-MS images reveal distinct differences in lipid distributions (e.g. phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin) between the scar and the healthy brain, suggesting that recovery processes are still in play. It is currently not known if the altered lipids in the scar will change on a longer time scale, or if they are stabilised products of the brain post-stroke. Conclusions The data demonstrates the ability to combine MALD-MS with in vivo PET to image different aspects of stroke recovery.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the role of glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in probiotics while also referring to other moonlighting proteins as the need arises. Probiotics do not produce toxic substances such as ammonia, indole, phenol, and nitrosamine, while probiotics can assimilate ammonia, inhibit the growth of toxic-substance-producing bacteria such as Escherichia coli, and adsorb and eliminate these substances. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) is one of the best-studied probiotic strains and many beneficial effects have been reported. LGG has been commercialized and consumed in a wide variety of food products and dietary supplements throughout the world for long time. Most reports about the multiple moonlighting functions of surface GAPDH in probiotics refer to adhesins. GAPDH has multi-binding properties. GAPDH may relate to stress response because some reports show expression of moonlighting proteins such as GAPDH increase under various stress conditions.

AB  - Abstract Post-traumatic stress disorder is a long-lasting psychiatric disease after the traumatic experience of severe fatal stress with the consequence of hippocampal atrophy. Freezing behaviors were more than quintupled on the fear-conditioning test in mice previously subjected to water immersion restrain stress (WIRS) with metronome tones when determined 1?28?days after WIRS, while these mice exhibited the increased immobility time on the forced swimming test with the increased spontaneous locomotion. Prior experience of WIRS led to a transient decrease in subsequent 5-bromo-2?-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation into proliferating cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. These behavioral and neurochemical alterations were significantly prevented by the daily injection of the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine, respectively. Moreover, WIRS significantly decreased the number of cells holding BrdU without affecting the differentiation ratio to astroglial and neuronal lineages 28?days later. Prior administration of an NMDA receptor antagonist significantly prevented the aforementioned changes by WIRS. These results suggest that NMDA receptors may play a role in mechanisms underlying the crisis of a variety of psychiatric symptoms relevant to post-traumatic stress disorder through transient suppression of neural progenitor cell proliferation in the murine hippocampal dentate gyrus.

AB  - ABSTRACT Joint injury is the predominant risk factor for post-traumatic osteoarthritis development (PTOA). Several non-invasive mouse models mimicking human PTOA investigate molecular mechanisms of disease development; none have characterized the inflammatory response to this acute traumatic injury. Our aim was to characterize the early inflammatory phase and later degenerative component in our in vivo non-invasive murine model of PTOA induced by anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. Right knees of 12-week-old C57Bl6 mice were placed in flexion at a 30° offset position and subjected to a single compressive load (12N, 1.4?mm/s) to induce ACL rupture with no obvious damage to surrounding tissues. Tissue was harvested 4?h post-injury and on days 3, 14, and 21; contralateral left knees served as controls. Histological, immunohistochemical, and gene analyzes were performed to evaluate inflammatory and degenerative changes. Immunohistochemistry revealed time-dependent expression of mature (F4/80 positive) and inflammatory (CD11b positive) macrophage populations within the sub-synovial infiltrate, developing osteophytes, and inflammation surrounding the ACL in response to injury. Up-regulation of genes encoding acute pro-inflammatory markers, inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin-6 and interleukin-17, and the matrix degrading enzymes, ADAMTS-4 and MMP3 was detected in femoral cartilage, concomitant with extensive cartilage damage and bone remodelling over 21-days post-injury. Our non-invasive model describes pathologically distinct phases of the disease, increasing our understanding of inflammatory episodes, the tissues/cells producing inflammatory mediators and the early molecular changes in the joint, thereby defining the early phenotype of PTOA. This knowledge will guide appropriate interventions to delay or arrest disease progression following joint injury. ? 2018 The Authors. Journal of Orthopaedic Research?

AB  - Impaired white matter integrity in traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to deficits in various neurological functions. The differentiation of the underlying pathological processes, e.g. edema, demyelination, axonal damage, to name a few, is of key clinical interest for the assessment of white matter injury. In this study, a combination of T2, diffusion and susceptibility MRI was used to study the spatiotemporal changes in white matter at 1?h, 3?h, and 1, 2, 7 and 14?days following TBI, using a rat controlled cortical impact (CCI) model. Based on radial diffusivity (RD), the rats were divided into two groups: group 1 showed widespread increases in RD along the corpus callosum of the ipsilesional hemisphere at day 2, and group 2 showed normal RD. Based on this group separation, group 1 also showed similar widespread changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) and T2 at day 2, and group 2 showed normal FA and T2. The widespread changes in RD and T2 in group 1 on day 2 were apparently dominated by edema, which obscured possible myelin and axonal damage. In contrast, the susceptibility of group 1 showed more localized increases near the impact site on day 2, and otherwise similar contrast to the contralesional hemisphere. The localized susceptibility increase is probably a result of demyelination and axonal injury. The extent of brain damage between the two groups revealed by MRI was consistent with behavioral results, with the first group showing significantly increased forelimb asymmetry and increased forelimb foot fault deficits. Our results suggest that the combination of T2, diffusion and susceptibility MRI may provide an opportunity for the differential assessment of edema and axonal damage in TBI.

AB  - Abstract We treated traumatic brain injury (TBI) with human bone marrow stromal cells (hMSCs) and evaluated the effect of treatment on white matter reorganization using MRI. We subjected male Wistar rats (n?=?17) to controlled cortical impact and either withheld treatment (controls; n?=?9) or inserted collagen scaffolds containing hMSCs (n?=?8). Six weeks later, the rats were sacrificed and MRI revealed selective migration of grafted neural progenitor cells towards the white matter reorganized boundary of the TBI-induced lesion. Histology confirmed that the white matter had been reorganized, associated with increased fractional anisotropy (FA; p?<?0.01) in the recovery regions relative to the injured core region in both treated and control groups. Treatment with hMSCs increased FA in the recovery regions, lowered T2 in the core region, decreased lesion volume and improved functional recovery relative to untreated controls. Immunoreactive staining showed axonal projections emanating from neurons and extruding from the corpus callosum into the ipsilateral cortex at the boundary of the lesion. Fiber tracking (FT) maps derived from diffusion tensor imaging confirmed the immunohistological data and provided information on axonal rewiring. The apparent kurtosis coefficient (AKC) detected additional axonal remodeling regions with crossing axons, confirmed by immunohistological staining, compared with FA. Our data demonstrate that AKC, FA, FT and T2 can be used to evaluate treatment-induced white matter recovery, which may facilitate restorative therapy in patients with TBI.

AB  - Abstract Identifying differential responses between sexes following traumatic brain injury (TBI) can elucidate the mechanisms behind disease pathology. Peripheral and central inflammation in the pathophysiology of TBI can increase sleep in male rodents, but this remains untested in females. We hypothesized that diffuse TBI would increase inflammation and sleep in males more so than in females. Diffuse TBI was induced in C57BL/6J mice and serial blood samples were collected (baseline, 1, 5, 7 days post-injury [DPI]) to quantify peripheral immune cell populations and sleep regulatory cytokines. Brains and spleens were harvested at 7DPI to quantify central and peripheral immune cells, respectively. Mixed-effects regression models were used for data analysis. Female TBI mice had 77%?124% higher IL-6 levels than male TBI mice at 1 and 5DPI, whereas IL-1? and TNF-α levels were similar between sexes at all timepoints. Despite baseline sex differences in blood-measured Ly6Chigh monocytes (females had 40% more than males), TBI reduced monocytes by 67% in TBI mice at 1DPI. Male TBI mice had 31%?33% more blood-measured and 31% more spleen-measured Ly6G+ neutrophils than female TBI mice at 1 and 5DPI, and 7DPI, respectively. Compared with sham, TBI increased sleep in both sexes during the first light and dark cycles. Male TBI mice slept 11%?17% more than female TBI mice, depending on the cycle. Thus, sex and TBI interactions may alter the peripheral inflammation profile and sleep patterns, which might explain discrepancies in disease progression based on sex.

AB  - Abstract Aim To determine the association between vitamin D and knee pain among participants of the Malaysian Elders Longitudinal Research (MELoR) study. Method This was a cross-sectional study from the MELoR study consisting of a representative group of 1011 community-dwelling older persons (57% female), mean age 86.5 (54?94) years; 313 were Malays, 367 Chinese and 330 Indians. Participants were asked if they had knee pain. Levels of serum 25-hydroxy cholecalciferol (25-[OH]D), an indicator of vitamin D status, were measured using routine laboratory techniques. Results In unadjusted analysis, presence of knee pain was significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency (odds ratio [OR] 1.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08?1.85, P 0.011). Vitamin D levels were significantly associated with ethnicity differences where Malays (OR 7.08; 95% CI 4.94?10.15) and Indians (OR 6.10; 95% CI 4.28?9.71) have lower levels of vitamin D compared to Chinese. Subsequent multivariate analysis revealed that the association between vitamin D deficiency and knee pain was confounded by ethnic differences. Conclusion A previous study suggested that vitamin D deficiency was associated with knee pain. This relationship was reproduced in our study, but we further established that the association was explained by ethnic variations. As vitamin D status is dependent on skin tone, diet and sunlight exposure, which are all effected by ethnicity, future studies are now required to determine whether a true relationship exists between vitamin D and knee pain.

AB  - Background:? According to The American Pain Society, pain should be considered a fifth vital sign. Pain is a prominent feature of venous leg ulcerations (VLUs). Sixty-five percent of VLU patients complain of severe pain. In several multicenter clinical trials, Apligraf, a bioengineered living skin construct, has been shown to accelerate healing in venous leg ulcerations. Anecdotal clinical observations suggest that Apligraf treatment is associated with pain relief. A treatment modality which promotes healing and reduces pain would significantly improve the quality of life in patients with VLU. Methods:? VLU patients with pain scores greater than 5/10 on a numerical scale or requiring narcotic analgesia were randomized to receive either Apligraf and compression or compression alone. There was a 3-week ?wash-out? period to ensure that pain was not due to other factors such as inadequate compression or infection. Patients were enrolled only after a negative quantitative biopsy. The intensity of pain was self-scored and a quality-of-life questionnaire was completed at each visit. Weekly wound area measurements were obtained with digital planimetry. Results:? Thus far in the enrollment period we have already seen a trend toward a significant reduction in pain in the Apligraf group. This pain relief occurs shortly after application indicating that a mechanism distinct from clinical healing. The Apligraf group also demonstrated acceleration in wound healing as well as a decreased time-to-complete closure. Conclusion:? Interval analysis of this multicenter trial suggests that Apligraf accelerates wound healing and reduces the pain associated with venous leg ulcerations. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Abstract The periosteum serves as bone's bounding membrane, exhibits hallmarks of semipermeable epithelial barrier membranes, and contains mechanically sensitive progenitor cells capable of generating bone. The current paucity of data regarding the periosteum's permeability and bidirectional transport properties provided the impetus for the current study. In ovine femur and tibia samples, the periosteum's hydraulic permeability coefficient, k, was calculated using Darcy's Law and a custom-designed permeability tester to apply controlled, volumetric flow of phosphate-buffered saline through periosteum samples. Based on these data, ovine periosteum demonstrates mechanically responsive and directionally dependent (anisotropic) permeability properties. At baseline flow rates comparable to interstitial fluid flow (0.5?µL/s), permeability is low and does not exhibit anisotropy. In contrast, at high flow rates comparable to those prevailing during traumatic injury, femoral periosteum exhibits an order of magnitude higher permeability compared to baseline flow rates. In addition, at high flow rates permeability exhibits significant directional dependence, with permeability higher in the bone to muscle direction than vice versa. Furthermore, compared to periosteum in which the intrinsic tension (pre-stress) is maintained, free relaxation of the tibial periosteum after resection significantly increases its permeability in both flow directions. Hence, the structure and mechanical stress state of periosteum influences its role as bone's bounding membrane. During periods of homeostasis, periosteum may serve as a barrier membrane on the outer surface of bone, allowing for equal albeit low quiescent molecular communication between tissue compartments including bone and muscle. In contrast, increases in pressure and baseline flow rates within the periosteum resulting from injury, trauma, and/or disease may result in a significant increase in periosteum permeability and consequently in increased molecular communication between tissue compartments. Elucidation of the periosteum's permeability properties is key to understanding periosteal mechanobiology in bone health and healing, as well as to elucidate periosteum structure and function as a smart biomaterial that allows bidirectional and mechanically responsive fluid transport. ? 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Abstract Following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), further mild impacts can exacerbate negative outcomes. To compare chronic damage and deficits following increasing numbers of repeated mTBIs, a closed-head weight-drop model of repeated mTBI was used to deliver 1, 2 or 3 mTBIs to adult female rats at 24 h intervals. Outcomes were assessed at 3 months following the first mTBI. No gross motor, sensory or reflex deficits were identified (p > 0.05), consistent with current literature. Cognitive function assessed using a Morris water maze revealed chronic memory deficits following 1 and 2, but not 3 mTBI compared to shams (p ≤ 0.05). Oxidative damage to DNA was assessed immunohistochemically in the dentate hilus of the hippocampus and splenium of the corpus callosum; no changes were observed. IBA1-positive microglia were increased in size in the cortex following 1 mTBI and in the corpus callosum following 2 mTBI compared to shams (p ≤ 0.05); no changes were observed in the dentate hilus. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocyte immunoreactivity was assessed in all three brain regions and no chronic changes were observed. Integrity of myelin ultrastructure in the corpus callosum was assessed using transmission electron microscopy. G ratio was decreased following 2 mTBIs compared to shams (p ≤ 0.05) at post hoc level only. The changing patterns of damage and deficits following increasing numbers of mTBI may reflect dynamic responses to small numbers of mTBIs or a conditioning effect such that increasing numbers of mTBIs do not necessarily result in worsening pathology.

AB  - Background: Combustible tobacco use is generally linked with accelerated periodontal bone loss and diminished post-surgical wound healing; however, the pathogenesis of this process at the cellular level remains unclear. Nicotine is known to affect human gingival fibroblast orientation, attachment, and ?1 integrin expression, yet little is known about its effects on osteoclasts, the cells most responsible for bone resorption. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of physiologically relevant nicotine levels on porcine osteoclast function as measured by resorption of calcium phosphate. Methods: Pure nicotine was diluted in medium to the following concentrations: 0.03 µM, 0.15 µM, 0.30 µM, 0.60 µM, and 1.50 µM. Porcine osteoclasts were seeded onto calcium phosphate multi-test slides and incubated at 37°C with half media changes every 24 hours. Cells received 0, 0.15, 0.30, 0.60, and 1.50 µM nicotine, or 25 nM parathyroid hormone (PTH). Osteoclast resorption was quantified by measuring the resorbed surface area of the calcium phosphate substrate. Results: Osteoclast cultures resorbed bone slices and calcium phosphate substrate. All nicotine concentrations and PTH resulted in statistically significantly greater mean percent resorptions than the control group (P <0.05). However, no statistical difference was found between the various nicotine doses or PTH. The number of osteoclasts increased in a linear relationship to the increasing nicotine concentrations; however, no correlation was found between osteoclast number and the amount of resorption. Conclusions: Nicotine is non-toxic to osteoclasts at the clinically relevant levels tested. Nicotine appears to stimulate osteoclast differentiation and resorption of calcium phosphate, the major component of bone. Nicotine-modulated osteoclast stimulation may, in part, explain the increased rapidity of periodontal bone loss and refractory disease incidence in smokers. J Periodontol 2003;74:1440-1446.

AB  - Summary? Putty form graft materials may have additional favourable effects when compared with particulate ones in periodontal bone defects. The purpose of this study was to assess clinical and also radiographic changes following application of (i) putty form demineralized bone matrix (DBM), (ii) particulate form DBM and (iii) open flap debridement (control), using modified curtain suturing technique in the treatment of interproximal suprabony (horizontal) defects. Twenty-five chronic periodontitis patients with 125 sites (radiologically ≥4?mm horizontal bone defect) were selected to participate in this triple-blind, split mouth, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Putty and particulate form DBM grafts were placed at experimental sites. Clinical measurements included probing depth (PD), relative attachment level (RAL), gingival recession and bone probing depth (BPD) were made at baseline and repeated 12?months after the operations. Standardized digital radiographs were also taken to measure radiographic bone level (RBL) at baseline and 12?months later to be compared in a software. Probing depth reductions and RAL gains were significantly improved in all treatment groups (P?<?0·001). No significant differences in soft tissue parameters were found among three groups (P?>?0·05). Bone probing depth measurements indicated comparable significant bone gain in graft applied groups (P?<?0·01) and a significant bone resorption in open flap debridement group (P?<?0·01). Radiographic evaluation did not show any significant bone gain or resorption in all treatment groups (P?>?0·05). The results of this study indicate that either putty or particulate DBM demonstrates similar enhancements in soft and hard tissue parameters. Applying putty or particulate form DBM results with slight bone formation when compared with open flap debridement in horizontal bone defects at 1-year post-operative examination according to BPD measurements.

AB  - Summary Background Colletotrichum is a rare cause of human infection. Previous reports about Colletotrichum keratitis were limited, and most diagnoses from past reports were based on morphological distinction, which could have led to underestimation of the prevalence of Colletotrichum species. Objective We reported phylogenetic analysis, clinical feature and treatment outcome of molecularly diagnosed Colletotrichum keratitis in our hospital. Patients/Methods We recruited 65 patients with culture-proven filamentous fungal keratitis between January 1, 2015 and December 30, 2018. Through molecular sequencing including internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and multi-locus phylogenetic analysis of fungal DNA, seven patients were verified as infected with Colletotrichum species, and their medical records were reviewed to determine the clinical characteristics. Results Six of seven patients had predisposing factors including trauma (5) and immunosuppressive status (1). Six isolates were initially misidentified as other fungi through morphological identification. ITS sequencing identified the isolates belonged to two species complex (SC): C. truncatum and C. gloeosporioides; multi-locus phylogenetic analysis enabled species identification including C. tropicale (3), C. fructicola (2), C. truncatum (1) and C. fusiforme (1). Five patients with C. gloeosporioides SC responded well to medical treatment and two patients with C truncatum SC underwent evisceration because of either no visual potential or intractable pain. Conclusions The molecular approach provides accurate diagnosis and raises epidemiological awareness of Colletotrichum keratitis. Through multi-locus phylogenetic analysis, we report the human infections caused by C. tropicale, C. fructicola and C. fusiforme. We also highlight the different clinical outcomes between C. gloeosporioides SC and C. truncatum SC.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction Volumetric muscle loss (VML) occurs following significant traumatic injury or surgical removal of skeletal muscle, resulting in nonrecoverable loss of tissue and long-term dysfunction. Perhaps less recognized is that VML injuries inherently disrupt the neuromuscular unit, resulting in fiber denervation and presumptive motor unit rearrangement, expansion, and/or loss. To characterize neural dysfunction we quantified motoneuron axotomy, in efforts to understand how this relates to the temporal coordination of neuromuscular and morphological alterations due to injury. Methods In an established rat tibialis anterior (TA) VML injury model, we examined the motoneuron, skeletal muscle, and maximal isometric torque at 3, 7, 14, and 21 days postinjury. Results Significant axotomy of 57?79% of all TA muscle motoneurons was observed through 21 days postinjury, which was coupled with a 45?90% TA maximal torque deficit. Discussion A ?20% partial ablation of the TA muscle causes disproportionate damage across the motor unit acutely postinjury. Muscle Nerve 57: 799?807, 2018

AB  - Objective Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation may play a key role in the aetiology and serve as biomarkers for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We performed a genomewide analysis to identify genes whose DNA methylation levels are associated with PTSD. Method A total of 211 individuals comprising Australian male Vietnam War veterans (n = 96) and males from a general population belonging to the Grady Trauma Project (n = 115) were included. Genomewide DNA methylation was performed from peripheral blood using the Illumina arrays. Data analysis was performed using generalized linear regression models. Results Differential DNA methylation of 17 previously reported PTSD candidate genes was associated with PTSD symptom severity. Genomewide analyses revealed CpG sites spanning BRSK1, LCN8, NFG and DOCK2 genes were associated with PTSD symptom severity. We replicated the findings of DOCK2 in an independent cohort. Pathway analysis revealed that among the associated genes, genes within actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion molecular pathways were enriched. Conclusion These data highlight the role of DNA methylation as biomarkers of PTSD. The results support the role of previous candidates and uncover novel genes associated with PTSD, such as DOCK2. This study contributes to our understanding of the biological underpinnings of PTSD.
