AB  - Abstract Purpose To assess the safety and efficacy of multi-ingredient sacha inchi microemulsion (SIME) eye drops designed to target (1) tear film instability, (2) tear hyperosmolarity, and (3) ocular surface damage and inflammation in moderate or severe dry eye. Methods This randomized, quadruple-masked, active-controlled parallel study in 64 adult patients comprised three parts. Part 1 (n = 3): one eye was treated with SIME for one day. Part 2 (n = 9): randomized eyes were treated with SIME and 0.2% hyaluronic acid (HA) control eye drops 3 times a day for 10 days. Part 3 (n = 26 + 26): randomized treatment was applied on both eyes 3 times a day for 30 days. OSDI change was tested for superiority of SIME over HA. Ocular assessments were performed at baseline and after the last dose. Results Both treatments were well tolerated without adverse device effects. Tear film break-up time (p = 0.0025) and ocular protection index (p = 0.0026; change vs. HA, p = 0.047) increased significantly with SIME after 30 days. Tear osmolarity decreased more in SIME than in the HA group and significantly with both eye drops in hyperosmolar subgroups. Corneal (p = 0.014) and nasal conjunctival staining (p = 0.043) were reduced with SIME in per-protocol patients (n = 24). Conjunctival (p = 0.001) and lid redness (p = 0.012) decreased with SIME in all patients (n = 26). Symptoms decreased by about 25 OSDI units with both treatments (p < 0.0001) and with nonsignificant difference between treatments. Conclusions Sacha inchi microemulsion (SIME) proved safe and efficacious in improving each aetiologic factor for dry eye as revealed through objective tests. Hyperosmolar stress dominating blink cycles must be disrupted by biophysical protection of the ocular surface to facilitate resolution of cellular damage and inflammation, and relief of ocular symptoms.

AB  - Through this brief review, we provide a comprehensive historical background of the development of nanostructured hydroxyapatite (nHAp), and its application potentials for controlled drug delivery, drug conjugation, and other biomedical treatments. Aspects associated with efficient utilization of hydroxyapatite (HAp) nanostructures such as their synthesis, interaction with drug molecules, and other concerns, which need to be resolved before they could be used as a potential drug carrier in body system, are discussed. This review focuses on the evolution of perceptions, practices, and accomplishments in providing improved delivery systems for drugs until date. The pioneering developments that have presaged today's fascinating state of the art drug delivery systems based on HAp and HAp-based composite nanostructures are also discussed. Special emphasis has been given to describe the application and effectiveness of modified HAp as drug carrier agent for different diseases such as bone-related disorders, carriers for antibiotics, anti-inflammatory, carcinogenic drugs, medical imaging, and protein delivery agents. As only a very few published works made comprehensive evaluation of HAp nanostructures for drug delivery applications, we try to cover the three major areas: concepts, practices and achievements, and applications, which have been consolidated and patented for their practical usage. The review covers a broad spectrum of nHAp and HAp modified inorganic drug carriers, emphasizing some of their specific aspects those needed to be considered for future drug delivery applications.

AB  - Quaternary-ammonium-compounds are potent cationic antimicrobials used in everyday consumer products. Surface-immobilized, quaternary-ammonium-compounds create an antimicrobial contact-killing coating. We describe the preparation of a shape-adaptive, contact-killing coating by tethering quaternary-ammonium-compounds onto hyperbranched polyurea coatings, able to kill adhering bacteria by partially enveloping them. Even after extensive washing, coatings caused high contact-killing of Staphylococcus epidermidis, both in culture-based assays and through confocal-laser-scanning-microscopic examination of the membrane-damage of adhering bacteria. In culture-based assays, at a challenge of 1600 CFU/cm2, contact-killing was >99.99%. The working-mechanism of dissolved quaternary-ammonium-compounds is based on their interdigitation in bacterial membranes, but it is difficult to envisage how immobilized quaternary-ammonium-molecules can exert such a mechanism of action. Staphylococcal adhesion forces to hyperbranched quaternary-ammonium coatings were extremely high, indicating that quaternary-ammonium-molecules on hyperbranched polyurea partially envelope adhering bacteria upon contact. These lethally strong adhesion forces upon adhering bacteria then cause removal of membrane lipids and eventually lead to bacterial death.

AB  - Hospitalization for major surgery or critical illness often associates with cognitive decline. Inflammation and dysregulation of the innate immune system can exert broad effects in the periphery and central nervous system (CNS), yet the mechanisms underlying memory impairment after surgery remain poorly understood and without effective therapy. Endogenous regulation of acute inflammation is providing novel approaches to treat several disease states including sepsis, pain, obesity and diabetes. Resolvins are potent endogenous lipid mediators biosynthesized during the resolution phase of acute inflammation that display immunoresolvent actions. Here, using a mouse model of surgery-induced cognitive decline we report that orthopedic surgery affects hippocampal neuronal-glial function, including synaptic transmission and plasticity. Systemic prophylaxis with aspirin-triggered resolvin D1 (AT-RvD1: 7S,8R,17R-trihydroxy-4Z,9E,11E,13Z,15E,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid, as little as 100 ng dose per mouse) improved memory decline following surgery and abolished signs of synaptic dysfunction. Moreover, delayed administration 24 h after surgery also attenuated signs of neuronal dysfunction postoperatively. AT-RvD1 also limited peripheral damage by modulating the release of systemic interleukin (IL)-6 and improved other clinical markers of tissue injury. Collectively, these results demonstrate a novel role of AT-RvD1 in modulating the proinflammatory milieu after aseptic injury and protecting the brain from neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline. These findings provide novel and safer approaches to treat postoperative cognitive decline and potentially other forms of memory dysfunctions.?Terrando, N., Gómez-Galán, M., Yang, T., Carlström, M., Gustavsson, D., Harding, R.

AB  - Self-assembly is a ubiquitous process in biology where it plays numerous important roles and underlies the formation of a wide variety of complex biological structures. Over the past two decades, materials scientists have aspired to exploit nature's assembly principles to create artificial materials, with hierarchical structures and tailored properties, for the fabrication of functional devices. Toward this goal, both biological and synthetic building blocks have been subject of extensive research in self-assembly. In fact, molecular self-assembly is becoming increasingly important for the fabrication of biomaterials because it offers a great platform for constructing materials with high level of precision and complexity, integrating order and dynamics, to achieve functions such as stimuli-responsiveness, adaptation, recognition, transport, and catalysis. The importance of peptide self-assembling building blocks has been recognized in the last years, as demonstrated by the literature available on the topic. The simple structure of peptides, as well as their facile synthesis, makes peptides an excellent family of structural units for the bottom-up fabrication of complex nanobiomaterials. Additionally, peptides offer a great diversity of biochemical (specificity, intrinsic bioactivity, biodegradability) and physical (small size, conformation) properties to form self-assembled structures with different molecular configurations. The motivation of this review is to provide an overview on the design principles for peptide self-assembly and to illustrate how these principles have been applied to manipulate their self-assembly across the scales. Applications of self-assembling peptides as nanobiomaterials, including carriers for drug delivery, hydrogels for cell culture and tissue repair are also described.

AB  - Effect of pretreatment with intrathecal excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists on the development of pain behavior caused by plantar incision. (University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa) Anesthesiology 2000;93:489?496. This study examined the role of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), non-NMDA, and metabotropic glutamate receptors (MGluRs) on the development of pain behavior after plantar incision. Rats with lumbar intrathecal catheters were anesthetized with halothane. Fifteen minutes before an incision was made, drug [40 nmol MK-801; 20 nmol NBQX; or 200 nmol [(+)-MCPG] or vehicle was injected intrathecally followed by an infusion of the same drug for 75 min. Withdrawal thresholds to calibrated von Frey filaments applied adjacent to the wound and response frequencies to a blunt mechanical stimulus applied directly to the wound were measured before incision and 1, 2, 4, and 6 h after incision and then once daily for 6 days. Preincision treatments with antagonists against the NMDA (MK-801) and Group I and II metabotropic receptors [(+)-MCPG] did not inhibit the development of mechanical hyperalgesia caused by incision. Preincision treatment with the non-NMDA receptor antagonist NBQX increased withdrawal thresholds at 1 and 2 h and on postoperative day 1 compared with the vehicle group; response frequencies were reduced 1 and 2 h after incision and on postoperative day 2 (P < 0.05). In an additional group, postincision treatment with NBQX was similar to preincision treatment. Conclude spinal NMDA and MGluR antagonists may not be useful for preventing postsurgical pain. Spinal non-NMDA receptor antagonists reduced pain behaviors, but a preventive effect using preincision treatment was not apparent. Comment by James E. Heavner, DVM, PhD. The incisional model using rats was developed by Dr. Brennan and colleagues for the study of acute surgical pain. In a previous study, they showed that blockade of non-NMDA excitatory amino acid receptors, but not blockade of NMDA receptors nor mGluR receptors reduces postincisional pain if administered after the incision is made. This study shows the same is true if the receptor antagonists are administered before the incision is made. However, the effect is not particularly marked and; therefore, pursuit of non-MNDA excitatory amino transmitter receptor blockers for the prevention of postincisional pain would not likely be fruitful. The results of the study do require us to rethink how postincisional pain differs from other experimental pains and the phenomena of ?wind-up? attributed to activation of the NMDA receptor. Worth keeping in mind is that incisional pain does not equal surgical pain, which may involve traumatic injury to nerves and produce a neuropath pain, which strongly indicates involvement of NMDA receptors.

AB  - Abstract Previous studies have shown that Schwann cell implantation offers a potential therapeutic approach to a variety of neurodegenerative disorders and traumatic injuries. In a clinically relevant paradigm, however, the implantation of autologous Schwann cells is problematic and the use of heterogenetic Schwann cells will be required. In the present study we addressed this important issue and analysed the immunogenicity and survival of allogeneic and xenogeneic Schwann cell suspension grafts in a prelesioned CNS fiber tract, the transected postcommissural fornix of the adult Wistar rat. Cultured Schwann cells from Wistar rat or human peripheral nerve were injected either immediately or after a delay into the transection site and the spatio-temporal pattern of leukocyte infiltration and of major histocompatibility antigen expression was characterized and semiquantified with immunocytochemical methods. Our main findings are that (1) invasive cerebral lesions induce the expression of MHC class I and II antigens, but only sparse infiltration of T-lymphocytes, (2) both allogeneic and xenogeneic discordant Schwann cell suspension grafts, from either neonatal or adult peripheral nerve, survive without any overt signs of rejection for up to 10 weeks after implantation; and (3) delayed implantation procedures have no effect on immune responses to allogeneic Schwann cell grafts. These results demonstrate that there is no marked ongoing immune reactions to heterogenetic Schwann cell suspension grafts and that long-term survival of cross-species Schwann cell grafts can be achieved in the absence of any immunsuppressive treatment. Thus the conditions for functional transplantation of Schwann cells across immunological barriers seem to be favourable and will have implications for future cross-species studies, and possibly also for clinical application.

AB  - ABSTRACT Although carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs) have been shown to exert prothrombotic effects in microvessels, it is poorly understood whether CBNs also have the potential to interfere with the process of leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions and whether the shape of CBNs plays a role in these processes. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the acute effects of two differently shaped CBNs, fiber-shaped single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and spherical ultrafine carbon black (CB), on thrombus formation as well as on leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions and leukocyte transmigration in the murine microcirculation upon systemic administration in vivo. Systemic administration of both SWCNT and CB accelerated arteriolar thrombus formation at a dose of 1?mg?kg?1 body weight, whereas SWCNT exerted a prothrombotic effect also at a lower dose (0.1?mg?kg?1 body weight). In vitro, both CBNs induced P-selectin expression on human platelets and formation of platelet-granulocyte complexes. In contrast, injection of fiber-shaped SWCNT or of spherical CB did not induce leukocyte?endothelial cell interactions or leukocyte transmigration. In vitro, both CBNs slightly increased the expression of activation markers on human monocytes and granulocytes. These findings suggest that systemic administration of CBNs accelerates arteriolar thrombus formation independently of the CBNs' shape, but does not induce leukocyte?endothelial cell interactions or leukocyte transmigration.

AB  - Abstract Background Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) protects the lung from sepsis-induced injury through activating Nrf2-regulated multiple phase 2 detoxification genes, including NAD(P)H: quinine oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO1). Based on the positive effect of Sirtuin 6 on Nrf2, we aim to explore the potential role of SIRT6 in the mechanism of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Methods Mouse models of sepsis were constructed by instilling intratracheal of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 4?ml/kg). After 48-hour treatment, lung tissues were collected to measure the degree of lung injury. The SIRT6, siSIRT6, and siNrf2 plasmids were cotransfected into various concentrations of LPS-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs; 0, 1, 5, 10, and 50??g/ml) using Lipofectamine 2000. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-6 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression levels of SIRT6, Nrf2, NQO1, and HO1 was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. Results Lung tissues in the model group already had basic characteristics of ALI. Compared with the control model, TNF-α and IL-6 levels were much higher (P?<?0.01), the levels of SIRT6, Nrf2, and Nrf2-modulated detoxification factors were downregulated (P?<?0.01). SIRT6 overexpression decreased the apoptosis below to 10% (P?<?0.01), significantly increased the Nrf2 expression, effectively inhibited TNF-α and IL-6 releases, and enhanced NQO1 and HO1 levels (P?<?0.01). siNrf2 abolished the protective effects of SIRT6 overexpression, including increasing apoptosis and inhibiting anti-inflammatory and antioxidative genes expressions (P?<?0.01). Conclusions Our study suggested SIRT6 positively regulated Nrf2 expression and activated Nrf2-regulated anti-inflammatory and antioxidative enzymes, which could effectively mitigate LPS-induced HUVECs inflammatory responses. This might reflect the mechanism of ALI induced by sepsis.

AB  - Abstract Aim:? To investigate whether severe loss of activities of daily living (ADL) in asylum-seeking children is associated with physical disease or toxic influences and to describe the clinical course during the recovery process. Methods:? A total of 29 asylum-seeking children with severe loss of ADL were regularly assessed by physical examinations, laboratory tests and a structured evaluation of their ADL status during rehabilitation. Results:? A total of 12 children had previously recorded suicide attempts and 21 were recorded to have experienced traumatic events in their country of origin. The mean time from turning point to recovery was 6?months. Of the study participants, 22 needed enteral feeding and 18 gained weight during recovery. All children had a pulse rate and systolic blood pressure within the normal range. No sign of intoxication or physical disease was identified in laboratory tests or clinical examinations, with the exception of one case of epilepsy. Conclusion:? Physical disease, pharmacological sedation or anorexia nervosa was not considered to be a probable cause of the loss of ADL in these children. The high rate of psychosocial risk factors and the stressful event of being in an asylum-seeking process call for further investigation of psychosomatic mechanisms.

AB  - Essentials The lectin pathway's MASP-1/2 activates coagulation factors but the trigger of the activation is unknown. MASP-1/2 activation was assessed by quantifying complexes between MASPs and antithrombin/C1-inhibitor. Activated platelets and fibrin were demonstrated to activate MASP-1 and MASP-2 both in vitro and in vivo. These findings may represent a crossroad between the complement and the coagulation systems. Summary Background The activated forms of the complement lectin pathway (LP) proteases MASP-1 and MASP-2 are able to cleave the coagulation factors prothrombin, fibrinogen, factor XIII and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor in vitro. In vivo studies also show that MASP-1 is involved in thrombogenesis. Objectives To clarify the not yet identified mechanisms involved in triggering activation of the LP during thrombotic reactions. Methods Novel sandwich-ELISAs for detection of complexes between MASP-1 or MASP-2 and the serpins C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) or antithrombin (AT), were used to specifically detect and quantify the activated forms of MASP-1 and MASP-2. Results Activated platelets were shown by flow cytometry to bind Ficolin-1, -2 and -3 but not MBL, which was associated with activation of MASP-1 and MASP-2. We also demonstrated that fibrin and the plasmin-generated fibrin fragment DD in plasma, bind and activate MASP-1 and MASP-2. As demonstrated by the ELISA and SDS-PAGE/Western blotting, the fibrin-associated activation was reflected in a specific inactivation by AT during clotting without the assistance of heparin. In all other cases the MASPs were, as previously reported, inactivated by C1-INH. In systemic lupus erythematosus patients with thrombotic disease and in polytrauma patients, the levels of activated MASP-1 and MASP-2 in complex with both AT and C1-INH were associated with markers of thrombotic disease and contact/coagulation system activation. Conclusions MASP-1 and MASP-2 are activated during blood clotting. This activation is triggered by activated platelets and by the generation of fibrin during thrombotic reactions in vitro and in vivo, and may represent a novel activation/amplification mechanism in thromboinflammation.

AB  - Abstract Endoneurial macrophages are crucially involved in the pathogenesis of neuropathies. Historically, the macrophage response in neuropathies is believed to be of hematogenous origin. However, recent studies could demonstrate an intrinsic generation of the early macrophage response by resident endoneurial macrophages after traumatic nerve injury and in a model of hereditary neuropathy. We hypothesized that the local macrophage response might suffice to generate an appropriate macrophage response in mild neuropathies, supplemented by infiltrating macrophages only in severe nerve pathology. To clarify this assumption, we investigated the macrophage response in acrylamide-induced neuropathy as a model of a slowly progressive neuropathy with a defined onset. We induced the neuropathy in bone marrow chimeric mice carrying green fluorescent protein transgenic bone marrow, allowing the differentiation of resident (GFP?) and invading hematogenous endoneurial (GFP+) macrophages. Quantification of GFP? and GFP+ endoneurial macrophages in the sciatic nerve revealed an increase only of resident macrophages in proximal parts, whereas in distal parts a minor additional influx of hematogenous macrophages was observed. The immunohistochemical profile of GFP? and GFP+ macrophages was similar but distal GFP? macrophages were differentially activated than their GFP+ counterparts. Characterization of CCR2-deficient mice revealed a function for this chemokine system in attracting hematogenous macrophages but not in generating the intrinsic macrophage response. In conclusion, we provide evidence for a role of resident macrophages in acrylamide-induced neuropathy. Resident endoneurial macrophages intrinsically generate the macrophage response in this slowly progressive neuropathy, which only becomes supplemented by hematogenous macrophages in distal areas of more pronounced damage. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that low-level laser therapy (LLLT) 688 nm and 785 nm accelerate dentin barrier formation and repair process after traumatic pulp exposure. The sample consisted of 45 premolars of capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) with pulp exposure Class V cavities. All premolars were treated with calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), divided in groups of 15 teeth each, and analyzed on 7th , 25th , and 60th day. Group GI ? only Ca(OH)2, GII ? laser 688 nm, and GIII ? laser 785 nm. Laser beam was used in single and punctual dose with the parameters: continuous, 688 nm and 785 nm wavelength, tip's area of 0.00785 cm2, power 50 mW, application time 20 s, dose 255 J/cm2, energy 2 J. Teeth were capped with Ca(OH)2, Ca(OH)2 cement and restored with amalgam. All groups presented pulp repair. On 25th day the thickness of the formed dentin barrier was different between the groups GI and GII (p < 0.05) and between groups GI and GIII (p < 0.01). On 60th day there was difference between GI and GIII (p < 0.01). It may be concluded that, LLLT 688 nm and 785 nm accelerated dentin barrier formation and consequently pulp repair process, with best results using infrared laser 785 nm.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To develop paclitaxel incorporated into unimolecular micelles based on hydrophobically derivatized hyperbranched polyglycerols (dHPGs) for use as mucoadhesive intravesical agents against non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two different types of dHPGs (HPG- C10-polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyethyleneimine (PEI)-C18-HPG) were synthesized and paclitaxel was loaded into these using a solvent evaporation method. After physicochemical characterization of the resulting nanoparticles, four human bladder cancer cell lines were incubated with various concentrations of paclitaxel incorporated in dHPGs and the results were compared with those of paclitaxel formulated in Cremophor-EL (Taxol?, Bristol-Myers-Squibb). In vivo, nude mice with orthotopic KU7-luc tumours were intravesically instilled with phosphate buffered saline, Taxol, or paclitaxel/HPG-C10-PEG. RESULTS dHPGs are mucoadhesive nanoparticles with hydrodynamic radii of <10?nm and incorporation of paclitaxel did not affect their size. The release profiles of paclitaxel from dHPGs were characterized by a rapid-release phase followed by a slower sustained-release phase. While the PEI-C18-HPG formulation released only ≈40% of the initially incorporated paclitaxel, up to 80% was released from HPG-C10-PEG. Moreover, only paclitaxel/HPG-C10-PEG was stable in acidic urine. In vitro, all paclitaxel formulations potently decreased bladder cancer proliferation although paclitaxel/HPG-C10-PEG was slightly less cytotoxic than standard Taxol. By contrast, in vivo, the mucoadhesive HPG-C10-PEG formulation of paclitaxel was significantly more effective in reducing orthotopic tumour growth than Taxol and was well tolerated. CONCLUSION Intravesical administration of mucoadhesive nanoparticulate formulations of paclitaxel might be a promising approach for instillation therapy of patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

AB  - Abstract Cataract, the opacification of the eye lens, is the leading cause of blindness worldwide?it accounts for approximately 42% of all cases. The lens fibers have the highest protein content within the body, more than 35% of their wet weight. Given the eye lens pure composition of highly abundant structural proteins crystallins (up to 90%), it seems to be an ideal proteomic entity to study and might be also hypothesized to model the other protein conformational diseases. Crystallins are extremely long-lived, and there is virtually no protein turnover. This provides great opportunities for post-translational modifications (PTM) to occur and to predispose lens to the cataract formation. Despite recent progress in proteomics, the human lens proteome remains largely unknown. Mass spectrometry hold great promise to determine which crystallin modifications lead to a cataract. Quantitative analysis of PTMs at the peptide level with proteomics is a powerful bioanalytical tool for lens-tissue samples, and provides more comprehensive results. New mass spectrometry-based approaches that are being applied to lens research will be highlighted. Finally, the future directions of proteomics cataract research will be outlined. ? 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 30:1173?1184, 2011

AB  - Background In ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI), current oral P2Y12 platelet inhibitors do not provide maximal platelet inhibition at the time of reperfusion. Furthermore, administration of cangrelor prior to reperfusion has been shown in pre-clinical studies to reduce myocardial infarct (MI) size. Therefore, we hypothesize that cangrelor administered prior to reperfusion in STEMI patients will reduce the incidence of microvascular obstruction (MVO) and limit MI size in STEMI patients treated with PPCI. Methods The platelet inhibition to target reperfusion injury (PITRI) trial, is a phase 2A, multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial, in which 210 STEMI patients will be randomized to receive either an intravenous (IV) bolus of cangrelor (30 ?g/kg) followed by a 120-minute infusion (4 ?g/kg/min) or matching saline placebo, initiated prior to reperfusion (NCT03102723). Results The study started in October 2017 and the anticipated end date would be July 2020. The primary end-point will be MI size quantified by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) on day 3 post-PPCI. Secondary endpoints will include markers of reperfusion, incidence of MVO, MI size, and adverse left ventricular remodeling at 6 months, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. Summary The aim of the PITRI trial is to assess whether cangrelor administered prior to reperfusion would reduce acute MI size and MVO, as assessed by CMR.

AB  - The timing, geographical locations, causes, and consequences of crop domestication have long been major concerns of archaeologists, and agricultural origins and dispersals are currently more relevant than ever to scientists seeking solutions to elusive problems involving food insecurity and global health disparities. Perennial research issues that archaeologists continue to tackle include (1) thinking outside centers of origin that were based on limited and insufficient past knowledge; (2) distinguishing between single and multiple domestications of specific crops; (3) measuring the pace of domestication; and (4) decoupling domestication from agricultural economies. Paleoethnobotanists have expanded their toolkits to include analysis of ancient and modern DNA and have added increasingly sophisticated techniques in the field and the laboratory to derive precise chronological sequences to assess morphological changes in ancient and often fragmentary archaeobotanical remains and to correctly interpret taphonomy and context. Multiple lines of archaeological evidence are ideally brought together, and whenever possible, these are integrated with information from complementary sources. We discuss current perspectives and anthropological approaches to research that have as their goals the fuller and broader understanding of ancient farming societies, the plants that were domesticated, the landscapes that were created, and the culinary legacies that were passed on.
