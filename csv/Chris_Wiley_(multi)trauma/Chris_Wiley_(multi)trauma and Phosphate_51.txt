AB  - Abstract Labeling embryonic cells to trace their motion is a classical experimental approach with a host of techniques being used to mark live cells and tissues. Genetically engineered fluorescent protein vectors (DNA plasmids) are a recent technology well suited to time-resolved studies of cellular motion in live embryos. DNA plasmids encoding fluorescent proteins can be introduced into cells using several methods, including electroporation, a technique used widely for analysis of tissue culture and embryonic cells. Here we describe a technique designed to introduce DNA plasmids into early gastrulation stage quail embryos, ex ovo. The method is effective, and with practice enables an investigator to direct the vectors to relatively confined regions of gastrulating embryos. The required electroporation chamber can be fabricated from common laboratory materials. We anticipate that using this method of labeling cells in a warm-blooded embryo, during gastrulation, will be a fruitful means of studying subsequent embryogenesis.

AB  - The timing, geographical locations, causes, and consequences of crop domestication have long been major concerns of archaeologists, and agricultural origins and dispersals are currently more relevant than ever to scientists seeking solutions to elusive problems involving food insecurity and global health disparities. Perennial research issues that archaeologists continue to tackle include (1) thinking outside centers of origin that were based on limited and insufficient past knowledge; (2) distinguishing between single and multiple domestications of specific crops; (3) measuring the pace of domestication; and (4) decoupling domestication from agricultural economies. Paleoethnobotanists have expanded their toolkits to include analysis of ancient and modern DNA and have added increasingly sophisticated techniques in the field and the laboratory to derive precise chronological sequences to assess morphological changes in ancient and often fragmentary archaeobotanical remains and to correctly interpret taphonomy and context. Multiple lines of archaeological evidence are ideally brought together, and whenever possible, these are integrated with information from complementary sources. We discuss current perspectives and anthropological approaches to research that have as their goals the fuller and broader understanding of ancient farming societies, the plants that were domesticated, the landscapes that were created, and the culinary legacies that were passed on.

AB  - Coronary artery disease (CAD) has been reported to occur prematurely in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Although persons with SCI have metabolic abnormalities that may predispose them to CAD, other potential aetiologies may also be operative. Increased platelet aggregation, among other factors, initiates thrombus formation at the site of the vessel injury, which may acutely obstruct arterial blood flow. Prostacyclin is known to have a beneficial effect to inhibit platelet aggregation and prevent thrombus formation. Platelets were studied from 12 pairs of monozygotic twins, one co-twin with SCI. Each twin pair had similar patterns of platelet aggregation with adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thrombin or collagen, as well as inhibition of platelet aggregation by prostacyclin (PGE1/I2) and synthesis of cyclic adenosine mono phosphate (AMP) by the prostanoid. However, the twin pairs differed in their response to PGE1/I2 inhibition of platelet-stimulated thrombin generation that was completely inhibited in non-SCI platelets but not in SCI platelets. Scatchard analysis of the binding of 3H-prostaglandin E1, a stable prostacyclin receptor probe, showed the presence of one high-affinity (Kd1=8·1?±?2·8?nM; nl=168?±?35 sites per platelet) and one low-affinity (Kd2=1·1?±?0·22??M; n2=1772?±?220 sites per cell) prostacyclin receptor in normal platelets, whereas in SCI platelets there was a significant loss (P<0·00l) of high-affinity receptor sites (Kd1=6·34?±?1·80?nM; n1=42?±?11 sites per platelet) with no significant change in the low-affinity receptor sites (Kd2=1·2?±?0·23??M; n2=1860?±?412 sites per cell). These discordant platelet findings in identical twin pairs raises the possibility of an environmental aetiology for accelerated CAD in those with SCI. The loss of inhibitory effect of PGI2 on thrombin generation in the twin with SCI appears to be because of loss of platelet high-affinity prostanoid receptors, which may contribute to atherogenesis in individuals with SCI.

AB  - Summary The aim of the present study was to evaluate possible injury provoked by an intensive reproductive programme based on rectal palpation in the cow. Alterations to the mesothelial surface of the peritoneum and to the oviductal mucosa were explored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Nine multiparous Friesian cows were selected from each of two commercial dairy herds. Cows in herd 1 were maintained on a weekly reproductive health programme, while those in herd 2 were not subjected to gynaecological exploration. Surface features of the mesothelial cells of the reproductive tract and adjacent ligaments, and the oviductal mucosa were explored by SEM observation of tissue specimens from each animal. Six cows in the intensive reproductive programme showed microscopic alterations of the peritoneal surface. Strands were observed in the oviducts and adjacent ligaments in five of these cows. These strands, composed of filaments covered with mesothelial cells, were probably adhesions. Cells with abundant vacuoles on their surface were detected in the mesothelium corresponding to three animals, two of which also showed microscopic strands. No peritoneal surface alterations were observed in the cows from herd 2. No oviductal mucosal modifications were detected in either group. These findings suggest that intensive reproductive programmes based on rectal palpation may increase the risk of peritoneal surface alterations in the cow, but effects on reproductive physiology are unlikely.

AB  - Summary Aim Tissue engineering has been recognised as one of the most effective means to form a new viable tissue for medical purpose. Tissue engineering involves a combination of scaffolds, cells, suitable biochemical and physicochemical factors, and engineering and materials methods. This review covered some biomedicine, such as biomaterials, bioactive factors, and stem cells, and manufacturing technologies used in tissue engineering in the oral maxillofacial region, especially in China. Materials and Methods Data for this review were identified by searches of Web of Science and PubMed, and references from relevant articles using the search terms ?biomaterials?, ?oral tissue regeneration?, ?bioactive factors? and ?stem cells?. Only articles published in English between 2013 and 2018 were included. Conclusion The combination of stem cells, bioactive factors and 3D scaffolds could be of far-reaching significance for the future therapies in tissue repair or tissue regeneration. Furthermore, the review also mentions issues that need to be solved in the application of these biomedicines.

AB  - Abstract The formation of biodegradable implants for use in osteosynthesis has been a major goal of biomaterials research for the past 2?3 decades. Self-reinforced polylactide systems represent the most significant success of this research to date, however, with elastic constants up to 12?15 GPa at best, they fail to provide the initial stiffness required of devices for stabilizing fractures of major load-bearing bones. Our research has investigated the use of calcium polyphosphate (CPP), an inorganic polymer in combination with polyvinyl-urethane carbonate (PVUC) organic polymers for such applications. Initial studies indicated that composite samples formed as interpenetrating phase composites (IPC) exhibited suitable as-made strength and stiffness, however, they displayed a rapid loss of properties when exposed to in vitro aging. An investigation to determine the mechanism of this accelerated in vitro degradation for the IPCs as well as to identify possible design changes to overcome this drawback was undertaken using a model IPC system. It was found that strong interfacial strength and minimal swelling of the PVUC are very important for obtaining and maintaining appropriate mechanical properties in vitro. ? 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Reduced HLA-DR expression on monocytes has been suggested as a predictive marker of immunosuppression following very high risk surgery, but there are few reports in lower risk surgery. In 32 patients undergoing low to intermediate risk surgery, blood samples were analysed by flow cytometry for HLA-DR expression and numbers in both CD14high and CD14lowCD16+ monocyte subsets. The numbers of CD14high monocytes increased at 24?h (mean (SD), 5.0 (2.2) vs 7.6 (3.9)???105?cells.ml?1; p?<?0.01) while CD14lowCD16+ monocytes decreased (0.68 (0.36) vs 0.44 (0.36)???105?cells.ml?1; p?<?0.01). HLA-DR expression was significantly reduced in both subsets by 24?h (mean (SD) fluorescent intensity 440 (310) vs 160 (130) for CD14high and 1000 (410) vs 560 (380) for CD14lowCD16+ subsets; p?<?0.01). This reduction of monocyte HLA-DR expression 24?h following lower risk surgery raises questions about the purported clinical utility of this biomarker as an early predictor of postoperative complications. Our results also suggest that surgery induces significant trafficking (i.e. mobilisation, margination and extravasation) of monocyte subsets, and that monocyte HLA-DR depression is the result of a down-regulatory phenomenon (decreased protein expression on each cell) rather than the differential trafficking of monocyte subsets.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives Full-arch rehabilitations in young patients suffering from dental agenesis should compensate for the reduced vertical dimension of occlusion and restore both esthetics and function at minimal biological cost. This requires precise planning and maximum patient compliance during the preprosthetic phase. The pretreatment period with tooth-colored splints promotes a predictable outcome of the final restorations. Clinical considerations: Thanks to better restorative materials and adhesive techniques and increased knowledge of how to preserve sound tooth structures, prosthetic dentistry has increasingly turned toward minimally invasive procedures. The present clinical case documents a minimally/non-invasive maxillary full-arch rehabilitation of an agenesis patient with multiple dental aplasia, primary tooth persistence, and deficits in bone growth. The patient was pretreated with a tooth-colored CAD/CAM polycarbonate splint. Adequate esthetics and function were achieved by two zirconia-based single-wing adhesive fixed dental prostheses to replace the upper lateral incisors, lithium disilicate ceramic partial crowns for the posterior regions, and two feldspathic veneers for the upper central incisors. Conclusions Non-invasive pretreatment with a removable tooth-colored splint realizes the treatment goal simply and safely, reduces treatment time, increases predictability, and facilitates the transfer of the prototype to the final restorations. New restorative options permit the minimally invasive treatment of such patients. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE A pretreatment with a removable tooth-colored splint offers a simple and safe way to define the treatment goal, reduces treatment time, increases predictability, and facilitates the transfer of the results to the final restorations even in complex cases. New restorative options permit minimally invasive treatments of young patients with multiple dental agenesis.

APMIS 2010; 118: 595?605. Long-term clinical use of glucocorticoids often causes the serious side effect of non-traumatic avascular osteonecrosis. The aim of this study was to examine the effects and mechanisms of a glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (Dex), on differentiation of primary cultured rat bone marrow mesenchymal cells (BMCs). We also tried to block the inhibitory effects of Dex on osteoblast differentiation. Adipocyte markers (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor?-2 and aP2) were increased in response to Dex treatment in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while osteoblastic markers [Runx2, COL 1, osterix, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and OC] were down-regulated, consistent with ALP and osteocalcin promoter activity. To validate the effects of Runx2 on the expression of osteogenesis and adipocyte genes, pCMV/Flag-Runx2 was transfected into BMCs, and relevant markers were detected after 10?7?M Dex treatment for 48?h. The results indicated that Dex treatment induced adipogenic differentiation and suppressed proliferation. No significant difference was detected in expressions of these genes between Runx2-transfected cells and Dex-treated BMCs. These data suggest that Dex primarily induced adipocyte differentiation of BMCs. Exogenous Runx2 can antagonize the effect of Dex on osteoblast differentiation.

AB  - Primary subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis can rarely be caused by Cladophialophora bantiana. Only two cases have been reported and we present the histologic and culture findings of another. A 32-year-old black female with systemic lupus erythematosus presented with a two-year history of multiple, recurrent, tender, ulcerated skin nodules with purulent drainage involving an area measuring approximately 27.0???15.0?cm on her upper back. She had been involved in a tornado at age 10 and had sustained traumatic implantation of wood splinters in this area. Sections of the excision showed scattered dark pinpoint foci with surrounding suppuration extending to the deep aspect of the specimen. Histology demonstrated features of phaeohyphomycosis ? foci of granulomatous and acute inflammation with central clusters of dematiaceous fungal hyphae within a fibrotic dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Chains of brown-pigmented septate hyphae and unicellular conidia were identified. Culture revealed pigmented septate, branched hyphae and unbranched acropetal chains of conidia with no attachment hila. Dark gray, velvety colonies formed in one week on a potato dextrose agar plate incubated at 25 degrees Celsius. These culture features were characteristic of Cladophialophora bantiana. Despite surgical excision and itraconazole therapy, her skin lesions persisted for the next two years necessitating a re-excision.

AB  - Essentials Coagulation Factor (F) XI is a safe target for the development of antithrombotics. We designed an antigen comprising the human FXI catalytic domain and diphtheria toxin T domain. Antigen immunization reduced plasma FXI activity by 54% and prevented thrombosis in mice. FXI vaccination can serve as an effective strategy for thrombosis prevention. Summary Background Coagulation factor XI serves as a signal amplifier in the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Blockade of FXI by mAbs or small-molecule inhibitors inhibits thrombosis without causing severe bleeding, which is an inherent risk of currently available antithrombotic agents. Objectives To design an FXI vaccine and assess its efficacy in inhibiting FXI activity and preventing thrombosis. Methods An FXI antigen was generated by fusing the catalytic domain of human FXI to the C-terminus of the transmembrane domain of diphtheria toxin. The anti-FXI antibody response, plasma FXI activity and antithrombotic efficacy in mice immunized with the FXI antigen were examined. Results The antigen elicited a significant antibody response against mouse FXI, and reduced the plasma FXI activity by 54.0% in mice. FXI vaccination markedly reduced the levels of coagulation and inflammation in a mouse model of inferior vena cava stenosis. Significant protective effects were also observed in mouse models of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that FXI vaccination can serve as an effective strategy for thrombosis prevention.

AB  - Abstract Astrocytes are involved in multiple brain functions in physiological conditions, participating in neuronal development, synaptic activity and homeostatic control of the extracellular environment. They also actively participate in the processes triggered by brain injuries, aimed at limiting and repairing brain damages. Purines may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of numerous acute and chronic disorders of the central nervous system (CNS). Astrocytes are the main source of cerebral purines. They release either adenine-based purines, e.g. adenosine and adenosine triphosphate, or guanine-based purines, e.g. guanosine and guanosine triphosphate, in physiological conditions and release even more of these purines in pathological conditions. Astrocytes express several receptor subtypes of P1 and P2 types for adenine-based purines. Receptors for guanine-based purines are being characterised. Specific ecto-enzymes such as nucleotidases, adenosine deaminase and, likely, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, metabolise both adenine- and guanine-based purines after release from astrocytes. This regulates the effects of nucleotides and nucleosides by reducing their interaction with specific membrane binding sites. Adenine-based nucleotides stimulate astrocyte proliferation by a P2-mediated increase in intracellular [Ca2+] and isoprenylated proteins. Adenosine also, via A2 receptors, may stimulate astrocyte proliferation, but mostly, via A1 and/or A3 receptors, inhibits astrocyte proliferation, thus controlling the excessive reactive astrogliosis triggered by P2 receptors. The activation of A1 receptors also stimulates astrocytes to produce trophic factors, such as nerve growth factor, S100? protein and transforming growth factor ?, which contribute to protect neurons against injuries. Guanosine stimulates the output of adenine-based purines from astrocytes and in addition it directly triggers these cells to proliferate and to produce large amount of neuroprotective factors. These data indicate that adenine- and guanine-based purines released in large amounts from injured or dying cells of CNS may act as signals to initiate brain repair mechanisms widely involving astrocytes.

AB  - Abstract Impaired neutrophil functions, and in particular their antibacterial activity, are known to reflect the immunocompromised condition of the host. To investigate the potential for prompt on-site measurement of this condition, we analysed the antibacterial activity of murine neutrophils by measuring the change in oxygen consumption in a 10 ?l sample solution in which bacteria and neutrophils were co-incubated. A critical point was the use of freeze-dried Escherichia coli (E. coli), which remarkably facilitated handling because of its ability to be stored at room temperature for extended periods and the ease in which its respiratory activity could be re-established. This therefore allowed the antibacterial activity of murine neutrophils to be measured following their co-incubation with E. coli. Indeed, we successfully detected a reduction in the antibacterial activity of murine neutrophils in mice subjected to water-immersion restraint stress.

AB  - A novel, non-invasive study of goggles, flight helmets, airplane windows, and canopies in Smithsonian collections is the first known large-scale technical survey of historic aviation plastics and leverages the world's largest air and space collection as evidence of the materials and technologies used to create transparent plastic objects in the early-20th century. Transparent windows in these artifacts were analyzed with Fourier transform and portable dispersive Raman spectrometers to identify polymers and plasticizers present. The study demonstrates the potential of Raman spectroscopy to objectively and non-destructively measure historic plastic compositions, including formulations that have become obsolete. Data was interpreted in combination with archival research of historical documents to identify window materials including glass, laminated safety glass, and sheets of plasticized cellulose nitrate, plasticized cellulose acetate, and poly(methyl methacrylate). Results are contextualized into a coherent history of the role transparent plastics played in enclosing airplane cockpits. Published 2014.

AB  - Macroscopic anatomy of the heart is evaluated best in living animals, because postmortal changes and the lack of the normal heart motion lead to misinterpretation. For the last 15?years functional cardiac imaging of animals has been performed by two-dimensional ultrasonography. However, three-dimensional echocardiography has multiple advantages over two-dimensional ultrasonography such as an improved assessment of the endocardial structures and the possibility of precise determination of the sonographic views for measurement. For these reasons the ultrasound system SONOS 7500 of Philips has been used for examinations since December 2003. These examinations were performed in healthy adult dogs of different sizes as well as in European Short Hair cats. Using a recently developed multi-frequent matrix array probe all regions of interest were directly on-line volume-rendered or represented in two exactly defined orthogonal views. Although the used matrix array probe was large, transthoracic left and right parasternal sonograms could be carried out without any problems in all small animals without sedation. For the first time the cardiac structures in dogs and cats such as the opening and closing of the left atrioventricular and aortic valves were represented within a 60?degrees?(15 or 30?degrees pyramidal volume. The morphology and the function of the atrioventricular leaflets could be evaluated exactly. For representation of a larger pyramidal volume or the three-dimensional simultaneous colour flow imaging, careful ECG gating is required. Unfortunately, the distinct respiratory arrhythmia in quiet dogs had a negative effect on the registration of four or eight heart cycles of the same length. Using biplane echocardiography the commonly represented sonographs for measurement were exactly determined. Additionally these techniques enabled the registration of new views for evaluation and measurements, which were not available from two-dimensional ultrasonography. This study has demonstrated for the first time that real time transthoracic three-dimensional echocardiography is feasible in dogs and cats and that it provides comprehensive visualization of the intracardiac anatomy in unique projections in living animals.

AB  - Abstract The cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) has been implicated in ischaemic, traumatic and excitotoxic brain damage. The results presented here reveal novel actions of IL-1 in the striatum which markedly exacerbate cortical neuronal damage elicited by local excitotoxins in the striatum or cortex. Intrastriatal infusion of IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-1ra, markedly inhibited striatal neuronal damage caused by N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) or α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptor activation in the rat. In contrast, intracortical infusion of IL-1ra failed to inhibit NMDA or AMPA receptor-induced damage in the cortex. Intrastriatal co-infusion of IL-1? with the NMDA or AMPA receptor agonist did not affect local striatal damage induced by activation of either glutamate receptor subtype, but caused extensive cortical damage when administered into the striatum with AMPA. This secondary damage was significantly reduced by pretreatment with the NMDA receptor antagonist (MK-801), which did not affect local (striatal) damage caused by AMPA. Infusion of IL-1? into the striatum (but not the cortex) markedly enhanced cortical damage caused by infusion of an NMDA or AMPA receptor agonist into the cortex. These data reveal selective actions of IL-1 and IL-1ra in the striatum, which influence cortical neuronal loss and suggest that IL-1 selectively enhances damage caused by AMPA receptor activation.

AB  - Mammals harbor a complex gut-associated microbiota, comprising bacteria that provide immunological, metabolic and neurological benefits to the host, and contribute to their well-being. However, dysregulation of the microbiota composition, known as dysbiosis, along with the associated mucosal immune response have a key role in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), type 1 and type 2 diabetes, asthma, multiple sclerosis, among others. In addition, outside the gut lumen, bacteria from microbiota are the causative agent of peritoneal inflammation, abdominal sepsis and systemic sepsis. Critical care interventions during sepsis by antibiotics induce dysbiosis and present acute and long-term poor prognosis. In this review, we discuss immunomodulatory effects of the microbial molecules and products, highlighting the role of Bacteroides fragilis, a human commensal with ambiguous interactions with the host. Moreover, we also address the impact of antibiotic treatment in sepsis outcome and discuss new insights for microbiota modulation.

AB  - Abstract The brain is unquestionably the most fascinating organ, and the hippocampus is crucial in memory storage and retrieval and plays an important role in stress response. In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the seizure origin typically involves the hippocampal formation. Despite tremendous progress, current knowledge falls short of being able to explain its function. An emerging approach toward an improved understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms that underlie functions of the brain and hippocampus is neuroproteomics. Mass spectrometry has been widely used to analyze biological samples, and has evolved into an indispensable tool for proteomics research. In this review, we present a general overview of the application of mass spectrometry in proteomics, summarize neuroproteomics and systems biology-based discovery of protein biomarkers for epilepsy, discuss the methodology needed to explore the epileptic hippocampus proteome, and also focus on applications of ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) in disease research. This neuroproteomics survey presents a framework for large-scale protein research in epilepsy that can be applied for immediate epileptic biomarker discovery and the far-reaching systems biology understanding of the protein regulatory networks. Ultimately, knowledge attained through neuroproteomics could lead to clinical diagnostics and therapeutics to lessen the burden of epilepsy on society. ? 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 29:197?246, 2010

AB  - Guided bone regeneration (GBR) is commonly used in combination with the installment of titanium implants. The application of a membrane to exclude non-osteogenic tissues from interfering with bone regeneration is a key principle of GBR. Membrane materials possess a number of properties which are amenable to modification. A large number of membranes have been introduced for experimental and clinical verification. This prompts the need for an update on membrane properties and the biological outcomes, as well as a critical assessment of the biological mechanisms governing bone regeneration in defects covered by membranes. The relevant literature for this narrative review was assessed after a MEDLINE/PubMed database search. Experimental data suggest that different modifications of the physicochemical and mechanical properties of membranes may promote bone regeneration. Nevertheless, the precise role of membrane porosities for the barrier function of GBR membranes still awaits elucidation. Novel experimental findings also suggest an active role of the membrane compartment per se in promoting the regenerative processes in the underlying defect during GBR, instead of being purely a passive barrier. The optimization of membrane materials by systematically addressing both the barrier and the bioactive properties is an important strategy in this field of research.
