AB  - Introduction:? Histamine and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) are well known biogenic amines (substances), which rapidly elute from the mast cell granules under physiological conditions. They play an important role in the smooth muscle cells motility. Aim:? The aim of the study was to investigate histamine- and VIP-positive mast cells in the wall of pig kidney blood vessels in concern to their role of motility of smooth muscle cells and renal haemodynamics, respectively. Material and Methods:? Extra- and intraorgan renal blood vessels taken immediately after slaughtering of eight 6?8?months pigs were studied. Tissue samples were immersion fixed in 0.05?Mcacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 5?days at 4°C. After fixation, tissue blocks were rinsed in 30% sucrose in distilled water at 4°C for 1?3?days. Cryostat sections (20?30 ?m thick) were prepared and thawed in 0.05?M cacodylate buffer, pH 2, overnight. Immunocytochemical procedure started for free-floating sections which were incubated in 1.2% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30?min, and rinsed in 0.1?M phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, for 15?min. Afterwards, sections were incubated with the primary antibodies in a dilution of 1:100 (histamine) and in vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) 1:1000 for 24?h at room temperature (RT), then rinsed in 0.1?M PBS, pH 7.4. Incubation succeeded: first, with biotinylated anti-rabbit (histamine) and anti-mouse VIP antibodies in a dilution of 1:20 for 4?h, and rinses in 0.1?M PBS, pH 7.4, and in 0.05?M tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, for 10?min. Peroxidase activity was localized by using a mixture of 3?mg 3,3? diaminobenzidine (DAB), in 15?ml 0.005?M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and 36?ml 1 % hydrogen peroxide for 10?20?min. Finally, a rinse in 0.01?M PBS, pH 7.4, was undertaken. Immunochemicals:? The antibodies used were rabbit anti-histamine (H7403) and rabbit anti-vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), or (PEPA41) (Sigma, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA). Results and Discussion:? It was established that VIP-positive mast cells were located in the media and in the adventitia of large arterial vessels and renal vein, as well. Histamine positive mast cells were found mostly in the intima of renal artery and in the other layers of the wall. Both VIP and histamine mast cells were observed next to small arteries and veins in the fat tissue, around extraorgan blood vessels. Our finding suggest to mast cells participation in the smooth muscle cells motility and the maintenance of local homeostasis, as well.

AB  - Abstract Human mesenchymal stromal stem cells (hMSCs) hold regenerative medicine potential due to their availability, in vitro expansion readiness, and autologous feasibility. For neural repair, hMSCs show translational value in research on stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI), and traumatic brain injury. It is pivotal to establish multimodal in vitro systems to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying neural actions of hMSCs. Here, we describe a platform protocol on how to set up organotypic co-cultures of hMSCs (alone or polymer-scaffolded) with explanted adult rat dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) to determine neural injury and recovery events for designing implants to counteract neurotrauma sequelae. We emphasize in vitro hMSC propagation, polymer scaffolding, hMSC stemness maintenance, hMSC-DRG interaction profiling, and analytical formulas of neuroinflammation, trophic factor expression, DRG neurite outgrowth and tropic tracking, and in vivo verification of tailored implants in rodent models of SCI. ? 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The present study was designed to provide an appropriate micro-environment for regenerating axotomized neurons and proliferating/migrating cells. Because of its intrinsic permissive properties, biocompatibility and biodegradability, we chose to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of a chitosan-based biopolymer. The biomaterial toxicity was measured through in vitro test based on fibroblast cell survival on thermogelling chitosan lactate hydrogel substrate and then polymer was implanted into a C2 hemisection of the rat spinal cord. Animals were randomized into three experimental groups (Control, Lesion and Lesion?+?Hydrogel) and functional tests (ladder walking and forelimb grip strength tests, respiratory assessment by whole-body plethysmography measurements) were used, once a week during 10 weeks, to evaluate post-traumatic recoveries. Then, electrophysiological examinations (reflexivity of the sub-lesional region, ventilatory adjustments to muscle fatigue known to elicit the muscle metaboreflex and phrenic nerve recordings during normoxia and temporary hypoxia) were performed. In vitro results indicated that the chitosan matrix is a non-toxic biomaterial that allowed fibroblast survival. Furthermore, implanted animals showed improvements of their ladder walking scores from the 4th week post-implantation. Finally, electrophysiological recordings indicated that animals receiving the chitosan matrix exhibited recovery of the H-reflex rate sensitive depression, the ventilatory response to repetitive muscle stimulation and an increase of the phrenic nerve activity to asphyxia compared to lesioned and nonimplanted animals. This study indicates that hydrogel based on chitosan constitute a promising therapeutic approach to repair damaged spinal cord or may be used as an adjuvant with other treatments to enhance functional recovery after a central nervous system damage. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Skin tissue engineering is a possible solution for the treatment of extensive skin defect. The ultimate goal of skin tissue engineering is to restore the complete functions of native skin, but until now the structures and functions of skins are only partially restored. By negative immunoselection (CD45 and glycophorin A), we isolated and cultivated adult human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSCs) that are of multilineage differentiation potential. In this study, we first demonstrated that by using gelatin/thermo-sensitive poly N-isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAAm) and the immunocompromised mice model, the hBMSCs possess the differentiation potential of epidermis and the capability of healing skin wounds. The in vitro observations and the results of the scanning electron microscope showed that the hBMSCs can attach and proliferate in the gelatin/thermo-sensitive pNIPAAm. To further monitor the in vivo growth effect of the hBMSCs in the skin-defected nude mice, the green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene was transduced into the hBMSCs by the murine stem cell viral vector. The results showed that the rates of cell growth and wound recovery in the hBMSC-treated group were significantly higher than those in the control group, which was only treated with the gelatin/pNIPAAm (p < 0.01). More importantly, the re-epithelialization markers of human pan-cytokeratin and E-cadherin were significantly increased on day 7, day 14, and day 21 after the hBMSC-scaffold with the pNIPAAM in the mice with skin defects (p < 0.05). Moreover, the stem cell markers of human CD13 and CD105 were gradually decreased during the period of wound healing. In sum, this novel method provides a transferring system for cell therapies and maintains its temperature-sensitive property of easy-peeling by lower-temperature treatment. In addition, the in vitro and in vivo GFP imaging systems provide a new imaging modality for understanding the differentiation process and the effective expression of stem cells in wound healing. ? 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Biocompatible tissue growth has excellent prospects for tissue engineering. These tissues are built over scaffolds, which can influence aspects such as cell adhesion, proliferation rate, morphology, and differentiation. However, the ideal 3D biological structure has not been developed yet. Here, we applied the electro-hydrodynamic jet (E-jet) 3D printing technology using poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid, PLGA) solution to print varied culture platforms for engineered tissue structures. The effects of different parameters (electrical voltage, plotting speed, and needle sizes) on the outcome were investigated. We compared the biological compatibility of the 3D printed culture platforms with that of random fibers. Finally, we used the 3D-printed PLGA platforms to culture fibroblasts, the main cellular components of loose connective tissue. The results show that the E-jet printed platforms could guide and improve cell growth. These highly aligned fibers were able to support cellular alignment and proliferation. Cell angle was consistent with the direction of the fibers, and cells cultured on these fibers showed a much faster migration, potentially enhancing wound healing performance. Thus, the potential of this technology for 3D biological printing is large. This process can be used to grow biological scaffolds for the engineering of tissues. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT The majority of periprosthetic joint infections occur shortly after primary joint replacement (<3 months) and require the removal of all implant components for the treatment period (~4 months). A clinically relevant animal model of periprosthetic infection should, therefore, establish an infection with implant components in place. Here, we describe a joint replacement model in the rat with ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and titanium components inoculated at the time of surgery by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), which is one of the main causative microorganisms of periprosthetic joint infections. We monitored the animals for 4 weeks by measuring gait, weight-bearing symmetry, von Frey testing, and micro-CT as our primary endpoint analyses. We also assessed the infection ex vivo using colony counts on the implant surfaces and histology of the surrounding tissues. The results confirmed the presence of a local infection for 4 weeks with osteolysis, loosening of the implants, and clinical infection indicators such as redness, swelling, and increased temperature. The utility of specific gait analysis parameters, especially temporal symmetry, hindlimb duty factor imbalance, and phase dispersion was identified in this model for assessing the longitudinal progression of the infection, and these metrics correlated with weight-bearing asymmetry. We propose to use this model to study the efficacy of using different local delivery regimens of antimicrobials on addressing periprosthetic joint infections. Statement of clinical significance: We have established a preclinical joint surgery model, in which postoperative recovery can be monitored over a multi-week course by assessing gait, weight-bearing, and allodynia. This model can be used to study the efficacy of different combinations of implant materials and medication regimens. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Scar formation after brain injury is still poorly understood. To further elucidate such processes, here, we examine the interplay between astrocyte proliferation taking place predominantly at the vascular interface and monocyte invasion. Using genetic mouse models that decrease or increase reactive astrocyte proliferation, we demonstrate inverse effects on monocyte numbers in the injury site. Conversely, reducing monocyte invasion using CCR2?/? mice causes a strong increase in astrocyte proliferation, demonstrating an intriguing negative cross-regulation between these cell types at the vascular interface. CCR2?/? mice show reduced scar formation with less extracellular matrix deposition, smaller lesion site and increased neuronal coverage. Surprisingly, the GFAP+ scar area in these mice is also significantly decreased despite increased astrocyte proliferation. Proteomic analysis at the peak of increased astrocyte proliferation reveals a decrease in extracellular matrix synthesizing enzymes in the injury sites of CCR2?/? mice, highlighting how early key aspects of scar formation are initiated. Taken together, we provide novel insights into the cross-regulation of juxtavascular proliferating astrocytes and invading monocytes as a crucial mechanism of scar formation upon brain injury.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical performance of G-Bond all-in-one adhesive with Gradia Direct resin composite placed in non-carious cervical lesions (NCCLs) over a five-year period. Methods:? Forty-seven restorations were placed in NCCLs in 10 subjects (age 45?75?years) after written informed consent was obtained. Institutional ethical approval for the trial was obtained before recruitment. Restorations were placed according to the manufacturer?s instructions and using 50% phosphoric acid to etch uncut enamel margins. Patients were recalled annually for five years and restorations reviewed for presence and marginal staining. Photographic records were obtained prior to restoration, immediately after placement and at each recall. Results:? At five years, 6 of the original 10 subjects were available for recall, meaning 27 restoration sites could be evaluated. All restorations remained intact apart for one partial failure at four years. This resulted in a cumulative retention rate of 97.5% of restorations at five years. Marginal staining occurred around seven restorations during the study. Staining tended to be isolated to a few patients. Conclusions:? It was concluded that G-Bond with Gradia Direct resin composite showed excellent results over the five years of the study. This material combination seems very suitable for the restoration of NCCLs.

AB  - 1 Human hand vein endothelial cells were isolated from blood obtained by traumatic venepuncture. Cells were identified as endothelial by staining with endothelium-specific antibodies. The subject groups studied were (i) non-pregnant, (ii) pregnant (mean, 35 weeks gestation) and (iii) pre-eclamptic women (mean, 36 weeks gestation). 2 Fura-2 was used to measure agonist-induced responses in intracellular Ca2+ in single endothelial cells isolated and maintained in vitro. All of the cells examined responded to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) with a large transient increase in Ca2+ followed by a sustained plateau. 3 The responses to ATP were significantly larger in the cells from pregnant women than in those from non-pregnant and pre-eclamptic women, but no other differences were observed. The amplitudes of the responses to ATP were (means ± s.e.m.) 0.56 ± 0.04, 1.42 ± 0.24 and 0.65 ± 0.09 fura-2 ratio units for cells from non-pregnant, pregnant and pre-eclamptic subjects, respectively. 4 In cells isolated from non-pregnant subjects, the amplitude of the responses to carbachol, histamine and bradykinin were all smaller than those activated by ATP: 5.1, 13.9 and 4.4 %, respectively. Not all cells responded to these agonists: 25 % responded to carbachol, 70.5 % responded to histamine and 12.5 % responded to bradykinin. Sixty-five per cent of the cells from normotensive pregnant subjects responded to bradykinin compared with 25 % in the non-pregnant and 13.9 % in the pre-eclamptic subjects. 5 These data suggest that there may be differences in the responsiveness of venous endothelial cells in pregnancy and that pre-eclamptic cells behave differently.

AB  - ABSTRACT Craniofacial (CF) tissue is an architecturally complex tissue consisting of both bone and soft tissues with significant patient specific variations. Conditions of congenital abnormalities, tumor resection surgeries, and traumatic injuries of the CF skeleton can result in major deficits of bone tissue. Despite advances in surgical reconstruction techniques, management of CF osseous deficits remains a challenge. Due its inherent versatility, bioprinting offers a promising solution to address these issues. In this review, we present and analyze the current state of bioprinting of bone tissue and highlight how these techniques may be adapted to serve regenerative therapies for CF applications.

AB  - Incurable ulcer in the lower legs means avascular skin defects exposing bone and osteomyelitis which cannot be repaired even with skin grafting. A total of 151 patients with incurable ulcers were operated with flaps; 60 cases of traumatized avascular defects, 20 diabetic ulcers, 17 osteomyelitis, 14 malignant tumors, 5 arterial obstructions, and 5 arteriovenous malformations, and others. A total of 61 island flaps were used; 20 posterior tibial perforator flaps, 7 saphenous flaps, 7 peroneal flaps, 4 anterior tibial flaps, 4 malleolar perforator flaps, 4 medialis pedis flaps, and others. In addition, a total of 82 free flaps using microvascualr anastomosis were sued; 24 flow-through anterior thigh flaps, 13 flow-throuh thoracodorsal artery perforator flaps (or latissimus dorsi MC flap), 8 paraumbilical (or deep inferior epigastric artery ) perforator flap, 6 saphenous venous flaps, 7 combined flaps, and 24 others. In conclusions, small ulcers could be repaired with minimal invasive methods including local perforator flaps and small muscle flaps under local anesthesia. Free flow-through flaps and free bypass flaps (for diabetic gangrene with ASO), and combined osteocutaneous flaps (for massive segmental defects after resecting advanced carcinoma) are indicated for large ischemic defects.

AB  - Background Endoscopic skull-base surgery (ESBS) is employed in the management of diverse skull-base pathologies. Paralleling the increased utilization of ESBS, the literature in this field has expanded rapidly. However, the rarity of these diseases, the inherent challenges of surgical studies, and the continued learning curve in ESBS have resulted in significant variability in the quality of the literature. To consolidate and critically appraise the available literature, experts in skull-base surgery have produced the International Consensus Statement on Endoscopic Skull-Base Surgery (ICAR:ESBS). Methods Using previously described methodology, topics spanning the breadth of ESBS were identified and assigned a literature review, evidence-based review or evidence-based review with recommendations format. Subsequently, each topic was written and then reviewed by skull-base surgeons in both neurosurgery and otolaryngology. Following this iterative review process, the ICAR:ESBS document was synthesized and reviewed by all authors for consensus. Results The ICAR:ESBS document addresses the role of ESBS in primary cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea, intradural tumors, benign skull-base and orbital pathology, sinonasal malignancies, and clival lesions. Additionally, specific challenges in ESBS including endoscopic reconstruction and complication management were evaluated. Conclusion A critical review of the literature in ESBS demonstrates at least the equivalency of ESBS with alternative approaches in pathologies such as CSF rhinorrhea and pituitary adenoma as well as improved reconstructive techniques in reducing CSF leaks. Evidence-based recommendations are limited in other pathologies and these significant knowledge gaps call upon the skull-base community to embrace these opportunities and collaboratively address these shortcomings.

AB  - Abstract Poly-(lactide-co-glycolide acid) (PLGA) has been widely investigated as scaffold material for bone tissue engineering owing to its biosafety, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. However, the bioinert surface of PLGA may fail in regulating cellular behavior and directing osteointegration between the scaffold and the host tissue. In this article, oxidized chondroitin sulfate (oCS) and type I collagen (Col I) were assembled onto PLGA surface via layer by layer technique (LbL) as an adhesive coating for the attachment of inorganic minerals. The multilayer-modified PLGA scaffold was mineralized in vitro to ensure the deposition of nanohydroxyapatite (nHAP). It was found that nHAP crystals were more uniformly and firmly attached on the multilayer-modified PLGA as compared with the pure PLGA scaffold, which remarkably improved PLGA surface and mechanical properties. Additionally, in vitro biocompatibility of PLGA scaffold, in terms of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) attachment, spreading and proliferation was greatly enhanced by nHAP coating and multilayer deposition. Furthermore, the fabricated composite scaffold also shows the ability to promote the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs through the up-regulation of osteogenic marker genes. Thus, this novel biomimetic composite scaffold might achieve a desirable therapeutic result for bone tissue regeneration. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Critical illness is an aetiologically and clinically heterogeneous syndrome that is characterised by organ failure and immune dysfunction. Mortality in critically ill patients is driven by inflammation-associated organ damage and a profound vulnerability to nosocomial infection. Both factors are influenced by the activated complement protein C5a, released by unbridled activation of the complement system during critical illness. C5a exerts deleterious effects on organ systems directly and suppresses antimicrobial functions of key immune cells. Whilst several recent reports have added key knowledge of the cellular signalling pathways triggered by C5a, there remain a number of areas that are incompletely understood and therapeutic opportunities are still being evaluated. In this review, we summarise the cellular basis for C5a-induced vulnerability to nosocomial infection and organ dysfunction. We focus on cells of the innate immune system, highlighting the major areas in need of further research and potential avenues for targeted therapies.

AB  - Aims The present study aimed at examining neuronal injury and repair in post mortem brain sections of humans who died from fungal central nervous system infections. Methods Histological and immunohistochemical abnormalities in 15 autopsy cases with fungal central nervous system infections from 1990 to 2008 were compared with findings in 10 age- und sex-matched control cases that died from acute non-neurological causes. The fungal pathogens were identified by culture or polymerase chain reaction and morphology in post mortem tissue. Seven patients with fungal encephalitis had either an organ transplantation or a malignant haematological disorder; five out of 15 did not have a classical predisposing illness but suffered from severe septic infections as the principal cause of immunosuppression, and three from alcoholism. Results Fungal organisms detected were Aspergillus spp. and other moulds, Candida spp. and black yeast-like fungi including Cladosporium spp. Histological analyses identified microglial activation, astrocytosis and axonal injury in the white matter without additional demyelination as characteristic features of this infectious disease. An increased rate of hippocampal neuronal apoptosis was detected in fungal encephalitis, while the number of recently generated TUC-4 and calretinin-expressing neurones in the dentate gyrus did not differ between patients and controls. Conclusions Unlike in other infectious diseases of the nervous system where a coexistence of damage and repair was observed, fungal encephalitis is characterized by strong damage and minimal neuronal regeneration.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2011) 119, 868?878. Abstract Traumatic injury to the CNS results in increased expression and deposition of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) that are inhibitory to axonal regeneration. Transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?) has been implicated as a major mediator of these changes, but the mechanisms through which TGF-? regulates CSPG expression are not known. Using lentiviral expressed Smad-specific ShRNA we show that TGF-? induction of CSPG expression in astrocytes is Smad-dependent. However, we find a differential dependence of the synthetic machinery on Smad2 and/or Smad3. TGF-? induction of neurocan and xylosyl transferase 1 required both Smad2 and Smad3, whereas induction of phosphacan and chondroitin synthase 1 required Smad2 but not Smad3. Smad3 knockdown selectively reduced induction of chondroitin-4-sulfotransferase 1 and the amount of 4-sulfated CSPGs secreted by astrocytes. Additionally, Smad3 knockdown in astrocytes was more efficacious in promoting neurite outgrowth of neurons cultured on the TGF-?-treated astrocytes. Our data implicate TGF-? Smad3-mediated induction of 4-sulfation as a critical determinant of the permissiveness of astrocyte secreted CSPGs for axonal growth.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate the complex fiber orientations and 3D collagen fiber network of knee joint connective tissues, including ligaments, muscle, articular cartilage, and meniscus using high spatial and angular resolution diffusion imaging. Methods Two rat knee joints were scanned using a modified 3D diffusion-weighted spin echo pulse sequence with the isotropic spatial resolution of 45 ?m at 9.4T. The b values varied from 250 to 1250 s/mm2 with 31 diffusion encoding directions for 1 rat knee. The b value was fixed to 1000 s/mm2 with 147 diffusion encoding directions for the second knee. Both the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model and generalized Q-sampling imaging (GQI) method were used to investigate the fiber orientation distributions and tractography with the validation of polarized light microscopy. Results To better resolve the crossing fibers, the b value should be great than or equal to 1000 s/mm2. The tractography results were comparable between the DTI model and GQI method in ligament and muscle. However, the tractography exhibited apparent difference between DTI and GQI in connective tissues with more complex collagen fibers network, such as cartilage and meniscus. In articular cartilage, there were numerous crossing fibers found in superficial zone and transitional zone. Tractography generated with GQI also resulted in more intact tracts in articular cartilage than DTI. Conclusion High-resolution diffusion imaging with GQI method can trace the complex collagen fiber orientations and architectures of the knee joint at microscopic resolution.

AB  - Abstract Tissue engineering is an exciting new cross-disciplinary methodology which applies the principles of engineering and structure-function relationships between normal and pathological tissues to develop biological substitute to restore, maintain or improve tissue function. Tissue engineering therefore involves a melange of approaches encompassing developmental biology, tissue mechanics, medicine, cell differentiation and survival biology, mechanostransduction and nano-fabrication technology. The central tissue of interest in this review is cartilage. Traumatic injuries, congenital abnormalities and age-related degenerative diseases can all lead to cartilage loss; however, the low cell density and very limited self-renewal capacity of cartilage necessitate the development of effective therapeutic repair strategies for this tissue. The ontogeny of the chondrocyte, which is the cell that provides the biosynthetic machinery for all the component parts of cartilage, is discussed, since an understanding of cartilage development is central to the maintenance of a chondrocytic phenotype in any strategy aiming to produce a replacement cartilage. A plethora of matrices have been developed for cartilage engineering approaches and many of these are discussed and their in vitro and in vivo applications covered in this review. Tissue engineering is entering an exciting era; significant advances have been made; however, many technical challenges remain to be solved before this technology becomes widely applicable across all areas of cartilage repair biology.
