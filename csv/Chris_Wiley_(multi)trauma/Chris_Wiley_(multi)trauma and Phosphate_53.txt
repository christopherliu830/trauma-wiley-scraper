AB  - Abstract LPS-binding protein (LBP) is an acute-phase protein with the ability to bind and transfer LPS of Gram-negative bacteria, as well as cell wall compounds of other pathogenic bacteria. This soluble pattern-recognition molecule is present in high concentrations in serum and represents an important defense mechanism of the host. Regulation of the hepatic acute-phase response and its termination are important mechanisms for limiting systemic inflammatory activity of the host organism. We show here that TGF-?1, in a dose-dependent fashion, is able to inhibit LBP transcript accumulation and LBP protein synthesis induced by IL-6, IL-1? and dexamethasone in hepatoma cell lines. These data were confirmed employing primary human hepatocytes, where TGF-?1 also inhibited LBP protein synthesis. We identified and analyzed several Smad-binding sites (Smads are major regulatory elements of TGF-?1) within the LBP promoter, and found that one of them was active. We furthermore identified an AP-1-binding site clearly conferring inhibitory effects of TGF-?1 towards LBP promoter activity, shown by gel shift and promoter mutagenesis experiments. Further elucidating the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of proteins involved in innate immune responses may potentially help to develop novel intervention strategies for the acute-phase response, sepsis, and septic shock.

AB  - Abstract In patients with breast cancer, metastases of cancer cells to the axial skeleton may cause excruciating pain, particularly in the advanced stages. The current drug treatments available to alleviate this debilitating pain condition often lack efficacy and/or produce undesirable side effects. Preclinical animal models of cancer-induced bone pain are key to studying the mechanisms that cause this pain and for the success of drug discovery programs. In a previous study conducted in our laboratory, we validated and characterised the rat model of Walker 256 cell-induced bone pain, which displayed several key resemblances to the human pain condition. However, gene level changes that occur in the pathophysiology of cancer-induced bone pain in this preclinical model are unknown. Hence, in this study, we performed the transcriptomic characterisation of the Walker 256 cell line cultured in vitro to predict the molecular genetic profile of this cell line. We also performed transcriptomic characterisation of the Walker 256 cell-induced bone pain model in rats using the lumbar spinal cord and lumbar dorsal root ganglia tissues. Here we show that the Walker 256 cell line resembles the basal-B molecular subtype of human breast cancer cell lines. We also identify several genes that may underpin the progression of pain hypersensitivities in this condition, however, this needs further confirmatory studies. These transcriptomic insights have the potential to direct future studies aimed at identifying various mechanisms underpinning pain hypersensitivities in this model that may also assist in discovery of novel pain therapeutics for breast cancer-induced bone pain.

AB  - ADAMTS-4 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs type 4) is a metalloprotease capable to degrade chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans leading to cartilage destruction during arthritis or to neuroplasticity during spinal cord injury (SCI). Although ADAMTS-4 is an inflammatory-regulated enzyme, its role during inflammation has never been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ADAMTS-4 in neuroinflammation. First, we evidenced an increase of ADAMTS-4 expression in the ischemic brain hemisphere of mouse and human patients suffering from ischemic stroke. Then, we described that ADAMTS-4 has predominantly an anti-inflammatory effect in the CNS. Treatment of primary microglia or astrocyte cultures with low doses of a human recombinant ADAMTS-4 prior to LPS exposure decreased NO production and the synthesis/release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including NOS2, CCL2, TNF-α, IL-1? and MMP-9. Accordingly, when cell cultures were transfected with silencing siRNA targeting ADAMTS-4 prior to LPS exposure, the production of NO and the synthesis/release of pro-inflammatory cytokines were increased. Finally, the feasibility of ADAMTS-4 to modulate neuroinflammation was investigated in vivo after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. Although ADAMTS-4 treatment did not influence the lesion volume, it decreased astrogliosis and macrophage infiltration, and increased the number of microglia expressing arginase-1, a marker of alternatively activated cells with inflammation inhibiting functions. Additionally, ADAMTS-4 increased the production of IL-10 and IL-6 in the peri-ischemic area. By having anti-inflammatory and neuroregenerative roles, ADAMTS-4 may represent an interesting target to treat acute CNS injuries, such as ischemic stroke, SCI or traumatic brain injury.

AB  - Summary In plants, there can be a trade-off between resource allocations to growth vs defense. Here, we use partial correlation analysis of gene expression to make inferences about the nature of this interaction. We studied segregating progenies of Interior spruce subject to weevil attack. In a controlled experiment, we measured pre-attack plant growth and post-attack damage with several morphological measures, and profiled transcriptomes of 188 progeny. We used partial correlations of individual transcripts (expressed sequence tags, ESTs) with pairs of growth/defense traits to identify important nodes and edges in the inferred underlying gene network, for example, those pairs of growth/defense traits with high mutual correlation with a single EST transcript. We give a method to identify such ESTs. A terpenoid ABC transporter gene showed strongest correlations (P = 0.019); its transcript represented a hub within the compact 166-member gene?gene interaction network (P = 0.004) of the negative genetic correlations between growth and subsequent pest attack. A small 21-member interaction network (P = 0.004) represented the uncovered positive correlations. Our study demonstrates partial correlation analysis identifies important gene networks underlying growth and susceptibility to the weevil in spruce. In particular, we found transcripts that strongly modify the trade-off between growth and defense, and allow identification of networks more central to the trade-off.

AB  - Abstract Cachexia presents with ongoing muscle wasting, altering quality of life in cancer patients. Cachexia is a limiting prognostic factor for patient survival and health care costs. Although animal models and human trials have shown mechanisms of motorprotein proteolysis, not much is known about intrinsic changes of muscle functionality in cancer patients suffering from muscle cachexia, and deeper insights into cachexia pathology in humans are needed. To address this question, rectus abdominis muscle samples were collected from several surgical control, non-cachectic and cachectic cancer patients and processed for skinned fibre biomechanics, molecular in vitro motility assays, myosin isoform protein compositions and quantitative ubiquitin polymer protein analysis. In pre-cachectic and cachectic cancer patient samples, maximum force was significantly compromised compared with controls, but showed an unexpected increase in myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity consistent with a shift from slow to fast myosin isoform expression seen in SDS-PAGE analysis and in vitro motility assays. Force deficit was specific for ?cancer?, but not linked to presence of cachexia. Interestingly, quantitative ubiquitin immunoassays revealed no major changes in static ubiquitin polymer protein profiles, whether cachexia was present or not and were shown to mirror profiles in control patients. Our study on muscle function in cachectic patients shows that abdominal wall skeletal muscle in cancer cachexia shows signs of weakness that can be partially attributed to intrinsic changes to contractile motorprotein function. On protein levels, static ubiquitin polymeric distributions were unaltered, pointing towards evenly up-regulated ubiquitin protein turnover with respect to ubiquitin conjugation, proteasome degradation and de-ubiquitination.

AB  - Abstract In this study, the neuroprotective effects of ginsenoside Rd (GS Rd) were evaluated in a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI). Rats in SCI groups received a T8 laminectomy and a spinal contusion injury. GS Rd 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg were administered intraperitoneally 1 hr before the surgery and once daily for 14 days. Dexamethasone 1 mg/kg was administered as a positive control. Locomotor function was evaluated using the BBB score system. H&E staining and Nissl staining were performed to observe the histological changes in the spinal cord. The levels of MDA and GSH and the activity of SOD were assessed to reflect the oxidative stress state. The production of TNF-α, IL-1? and IL-1 was assessed using ELISA kits to examine the inflammatory responses in the spinal cord. TUNEL staining was used to detect the cell apoptosis in the spinal cord. Western blot analysis was used to examine the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins and MAPK proteins. The results demonstrated that GS Rd 25 and 50 mg/kg significantly improved the locomotor function of rats after SCI, reduced tissue injury and increased neuron survival in the spinal cord. Mechanically, GS Rd decreased MDA level, increased GSH level and SOD activity, reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and prevented cell apoptosis. The effects were equivalent to those of dexamethasone. In addition, GS Rd effectively inhibited the activation of MAPK signalling pathway induced by SCI, which might be involved in the protective effects of GS Rd against SCI. In conclusion, GS Rd attenuates SCI-induced secondary injury through reversing the redox-state imbalance, inhibiting the inflammatory response and apoptosis in the spinal cord tissue.

AB  - Repair and regeneration of craniofacial tissues is particularly challenging because they comprise a complex structure of hard and soft tissues involved in intricate functions. This study combined collagen scaffolds and human adipose stem cells (hASCs) for oral mucosal and calvarial bone regeneration by using resveratrol (RSV), which affects the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. We have evaluated the effect of collagen scaffold-containing RSV (collagen/RSV) scaffolds both in vitro and in vivo for their wound healing and bone regeneration potential. Scanning electron microscopy and immunostaining results reveal that hASCs adhere well to and proliferate on both collagen scaffolds and collagen/RSV scaffolds. Oral mucosal lesion experiments demonstrated that the collagen/RSV scaffold is more effective in wound closure and contraction than the collagen scaffold. The micro-computed tomography (?CT) images of calvarial bone display regenerating bone in defects covered with hASCs on collagen/RSV scaffolds that are more visible than that in defects covered with hASCs on a collagen scaffolds. RSV was more effective at inducing hASC differentiation on the collagen scaffold, suggesting that collagen/RSV scaffolds can provide useful biological cues that stimulate craniofacial tissue formation.

AB  - Summary Objective In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), pathologic high frequency oscillations (pHFOs, 200?600 Hz) are present in the hippocampus, especially the dentate gyrus (DG). The pHFOs emerge during a latent period prior to the onset of spontaneous generalized seizures. We used a unilateral suprahippocampal injection of kainic acid (KA) mouse model of TLE to characterize the properties of hippocampal pHFOs during epileptogenesis. Methods In awake head-fixed mice, 4?14 days after KA-induced status epilepticus (SE), we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) with 64-channel silicon probes spanning from CA1 alveus to the DG hilus, or with glass pipettes in the DC mode in the CA1 str radiatum. Results The pHFOs, are observed simultaneously in the CA1 and the DG, or in the DG alone, as early as 4 days post-SE. The pHFOs ride on top of DC deflections, occur during motionless periods, persist through the onset of TLE, and are generated in bursts. Burst parameters remain remarkably constant during epileptogenesis, with a random number of pHFOs generated per burst. In contrast, pHFO duration and spectral dynamics evolve from short events at 4 days post-SE to prolonged discharges with complex spectral characteristics by 14 days post-SE. Simultaneous dural EEG recordings were exceedingly unreliable for detecting hippocampal pHFOs; therefore, such recordings may deceptively indicate a ?silent? period even when massive hippocampal activity is present. Significance Our results demonstrate that hippocampal pHFOs exhibit a dynamic evolution during the epileptogenic period following SE, consistent with their role in transitioning to the chronic stage of TLE.

AB  - Abstract The lack of endogenous repair following spinal cord injury (SCI) accounts for the frequent permanent deficits for which effective treatments are absent. Previously, we demonstrated that low sulfated modified heparin mimetics (LS-mHeps) attenuate astrocytosis, suggesting they may represent a novel therapeutic approach. mHeps are glycomolecules with structural similarities to resident heparan sulfates (HS), which modulate cell signaling by both sequestering ligands, and acting as cofactors in the formation of ligand?receptor complexes. To explore whether mHeps can affect the myelination and neurite outgrowth necessary for repair after SCI, we created lesioned or demyelinated neural cell co-cultures and exposed them with a panel of mHeps with varying degrees and positions of their sulfate moieties. LS-mHep7 enhanced neurite outgrowth and myelination, whereas highly sulfated mHeps (HS-mHeps) had attenuating effects. LS-mHeps had no effects on myelination or neurite extension in developing, uninjured myelinating cultures, suggesting they might exert their proregenerating effects by modulating or sequestering inhibitory factors secreted after injury. To investigate this, we examined conditioned media from cultures using chemokine arrays and conducted an unbiased proteomics approach by applying TMT-LC/MS to mHep7 affinity purified conditioned media from these cultures. Multiple protein factors reported to play a role in damage or repair mechanisms were identified, including amyloid betaA4. Amyloid beta peptide (1?42) was validated as an important candidate by treating myelination cultures and shown to inhibit myelination. Thus, we propose that LS-mHeps exert multiple beneficial effects on mechanisms supporting enhanced repair, and represent novel candidates as therapeutics for CNS damage.

AB  - Abstract Heterotopic ossification is a debilitating condition that can result from traumatic injury, surgery, or genetic disease. We investigated the cellular origins of heterotopic skeletogenesis in the mouse using lineage tracing and bioassays of heterotopic ossification based on intramuscular transplantation. We identified, characterized, and purified a tissue-resident stem/progenitor cell population that exhibits robust osteogenic potential and represents a major cell-of-origin for heterotopic ossification. These progenitors reside in the interstitium of skeletal muscle and other tissues, and are distinct from the endothelium, which does not exhibit osteogenic activity in response to bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) stimulation. Intramuscular transplantation, together with clonal analysis in culture, revealed that these progenitors are multipotent, exhibiting the capacity for both BMP-dependent skeletogenic differentiation and spontaneous adipogenic differentiation. Identifying the cells-of-origin responsible for heterotopic ossification provides a potential therapeutic target to treat, mitigate, or prevent this disabling condition. ? 2012 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

This study evaluated the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial properties of magnesium?9%aluminum?1%zinc (AZ91) and commercially pure titanium (cpTi) against Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab307). The in vitro results showed that as compared to cpTi, incubation with AZ91 significantly reduced both the planktonic (cpTi?=?3.45e8, AZ91?=?8.97e7, p?<?0.001) colony forming units (CFU) and biofilm-associated (cpTi?=?3.89e8, AZ91?=?1.78e7, p?=?0.01) CFU of Ab307. However, in vivo results showed no significant differences in the CFU enumerated from the cpTi and AZ91 implants following a 1-week implantation in an established rodent model of Ab307 implant associated infection (cpTi?=?5.23e3, AZ91?=?2.46e3, p?=?0.29). It is proposed that the in vitro results were associated with an increased pH in the bacterial culture as a result of the AZ91 corrosion process. The robust in vivo buffering capacity likely diminished this corrosion associated pH antimicrobial effect. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in regulating the inflammatory response and immune reactions. In the central nervous system (CNS), IL-10 is mainly produced by astrocytes and microglia and it is upregulated after various insults, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, middle cerebral artery occlusion, excitotoxicity and traumatic brain injury. To better understand the effects of IL-10 in the normal and injured CNS, we generated transgenic mice (termed GFAP-IL-10Tg) that expressed the murine IL-10 gene under the transcriptional control of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter. Previous studies demonstrated marked changes in the microglial phenotype in these mice under basal conditions. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of local astrocyte-targeted IL-10 production on glial activation, neuronal degeneration and leukocyte recruitment after axotomy. GFAP-IL-10Tg mice had marked changes in the phenotype of activated microglial cells, as well as in the number of microglial clusters and in microglial cell density. These microglial changes are accompanied by a twofold increase in lymphocyte infiltration in GFAP-IL-10Tg mice and around twofold decrease in neuronal cell death at 21 dpi. Altogether, our findings suggested that astrocyte-targeted production of IL-10 impacted the microglial response and lymphocyte recruitment and culminated in a beneficial effect on neuronal survival.

AB  - Abstract Stress-induced cortical alertness is maintained by a heightened excitability of noradrenergic neurons innervating, notably, the prefrontal cortex. However, neither the signaling axis linking hypothalamic activation to delayed and lasting noradrenergic excitability nor the molecular cascade gating noradrenaline synthesis is defined. Here, we show that hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone-releasing neurons innervate ependymal cells of the 3rd ventricle to induce ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) release for transport through the brain's aqueductal system. CNTF binding to its cognate receptors on norepinephrinergic neurons in the locus coeruleus then initiates sequential phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and tyrosine hydroxylase with the Ca2+-sensor secretagogin ensuring activity dependence in both rodent and human brains. Both CNTF and secretagogin ablation occlude stress-induced cortical norepinephrine synthesis, ensuing neuronal excitation and behavioral stereotypes. Cumulatively, we identify a multimodal pathway that is rate-limited by CNTF volume transmission and poised to directly convert hypothalamic activation into long-lasting cortical excitability following acute stress.

Incidence and clinical significance of bacterial and fungal contamination of the preservation solution in liver transplantation.?Transpl Infect Dis 2011: 13: 84?88. All rights reserved Abstract: A perfusion fluid used in the preservation of the grafted liver represents a medium suitable for microorganism growth. In this observational study, a sample of 232 transplanted livers was collected. Perfusion fluid samples were stored for microbiological analysis from harvested donors. Bacteria were isolated in 91 out of 232 samples, post-operative infections related to contaminated perfusion solution occurred in 13 cases. The contamination rate of the preservation medium appears to be high, but postoperative infections occurs rarely. We suggest periodic detection and a protocol in place designed for antibiotic use for transplanted patients exposed to contaminated perfusion solution.

AB  - Abstract Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are typically used as a cell source for the reconstruction of hollow organs by conventional tissue engineering techniques. However, the necessity for and advantage of the use of tissue-specific SMCs are unknown. The present study investigated the phenotypic changes that occur following isolation and in vitro expansion of rat SMC populations isolated from three different tissues: the aorta, oesophagus and urinary bladder. rSMCs were isolated by enzymatic dispersion and expanded by conventional cell culture techniques, yielding microscopically homogeneous populations. SMC phenotypes were monitored according to their expression of marker proteins during the first two passages. Two of the three SMC populations (rSMC-a and rSMC-e) showed a marked change in their marker protein profiles during the first two passages, which resulted in a homogeneous phenotype that was neither fully contractile nor fully synthetic. SMCs from the urinary bladder did not show such a shift. Differences between the three rSMC populations were observed with regard to proliferative activity and gene expression patterns, suggesting the retention of some tissue-specific cell characteristics. In summary, phenotypic changes in SMCs occur as a result of conventional cell isolation and expansion techniques, thus questioning the necessity for a tissue-specific cell source for regenerative medicine applications.

AB  - Abstract The spectrum of activity of vitamin D goes beyond calcium and bone homeostasis, and growing evidence suggests that vitamin D contributes to maintain musculoskeletal health in healthy subjects as well as in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), who display the combination of bone metabolism disorder, muscle wasting, and weakness. Here, we review how vitamin D represents a pathway in which bone and muscle may interact. In vitro studies have confirmed that the vitamin D receptor is present on muscle, describing the mechanisms whereby vitamin D directly affects skeletal muscle. These include genomic and non-genomic (rapid) effects, regulating cellular differentiation and proliferation. Observational studies have shown that circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels correlate with the clinical symptoms and muscle morphological changes observed in CKD patients. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to low bone formation rate and bone mineral density, with an increased risk of skeletal fractures. The impact of low vitamin D status on skeletal muscle may also affect muscle metabolic pathways, including its sensitivity to insulin. Although some interventional studies have shown that vitamin D may improve physical performance and protect against the development of histological and radiological signs of hyperparathyroidism, evidence is still insufficient to draw definitive conclusions.

AB  - Abstract Background Previous studies document the therapeutic potential of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) in an absorbable collagen sponge (ACS) carrier for indications in the axial and appendicular skeleton. Nevertheless, the ACS does not comprise structural integrity to adequately support bone formation for onlay indications. The objective of this study was to evaluate local bone formation and osseointegration following surgical implantation of rhBMP-2 soak-loaded onto a compression resistant matrix (CRM). Methods Routine, contralateral, critical-size, supraalveolar, peri-implant defects in five adult male Hound Labrador mongrel dogs received 0.8 mg rhBMP-2 soak-loaded onto either the ACS (benchmark control) or a CRM (collagen/?-TCP/hydroxyapatite) followed by submerged wound closure for primary intention healing. The animals were euthanized at 8 weeks for histologic/histometric evaluation. Results Healing was uneventful albeit considerable initial swelling was observed for either treatment. Sites receiving rhBMP-2/CRM showed significantly increased bone area (20.0 ± 0.9 versus 12.3 ± 2.6 mm2, p = 0.03) and bone density (24.1 ± 1.4% versus 14.6 ± 2.0%, p = 0.04) compared with those receiving rhBMP-2/ACS. There were no significant differences between treatments for new bone height and osseointegration. Woven and lamellar trabecular bone lined with abundant osteoid was observed for all sites. Inconsistent cortex formation confirmed the immature nature of the newly formed bone. Seroma formation was observed for both treatments (80?100% of the animals/implants). Sites receiving rhBMP-2/CRM showed residual ceramic granules undergoing biodegradation, including accumulation of foamy macrophages. Conclusions rhBMP-2/CRM supports bone formation of clinically relevant geometry. Longer observation intervals as well as dose variations appear necessary to capture maturation of the newly formed bone, elimination of residual ceramic granules and resolution of seroma formation(s).
