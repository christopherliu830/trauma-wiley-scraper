AB  - Bone, as a mineralized composite of inorganic (mostly carbonated hydroxyapatite) and organic (mainly type I collagen) phases, possesses a unique combination of remarkable strength and toughness. Its excellent mechanical properties are related to its hierarchical structures and precise organization of the inorganic and organic phases at the nanoscale: Nanometer-sized hydroxyapatite crystals periodically deposit within the gap zones of collagen fibrils during bone biomineralization process. This hierarchical arrangement produces nanomechanical heterogeneities, which enable a mechanism for high energy dissipation and resistance to fracture. The excellent mechanical properties integrated with the hierarchical nanostructure of bone have inspired chemists and material scientists to develop biomimetic strategies for artificial bone grafts in tissue engineering (TE). This critical review provides a broad overview of the current mechanisms involved in bone biomineralization, and the relationship between bone hierarchical structures and the deformation mechanism. Our goal in this review is to inspire the application of these principles toward bone TE.

AB  - Abstract Four decades after the first isolation and characterization of clonogenic bone marrow stromal cells or mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in the laboratory of Dr. Alexander Friedenstien, the therapeutic application of their progeny following ex vivo expansion are only now starting to be realized in the clinic. The multipotency, paracrine effects, and immune-modulatory properties of MSC present them as an ideal stem cell candidate for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In recent years it has come to light that MSC encompass plasticity that extends beyond the conventional bone, adipose, cartilage, and other skeletal structures, and has expanded to the differentiation of liver, kidney, muscle, skin, neural, and cardiac cell lineages. This review will specifically focus on the skeletal regenerative capacity of bone marrow derived MSC alone or in combination with growth factors, biocompatible scaffolds, and following genetic modification.

AB  - Abstract microRNAs are functional, 22 nt, noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression. Disturbance of microRNA expression may play a role in the initiation and progression of certain diseases. A microRNA expression signature has been identified that is associated with pancreatic cancer. This has been accomplished with the application of real-time PCR profiling of over 200 microRNA precursors on specimens of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma, paired benign tissue, normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis and nine pancreatic cancer cell lines. Hierarchical clustering was able to distinguish tumor from normal pancreas, pancreatitis and cell lines. The PAM algorithm correctly classified 28 of 28 tumors, 6 of 6 normal pancreas and 11 of 15 adjacent benign tissues. One hundred microRNA precursors were aberrantly expressed in pancreatic cancer or desmoplasia (p < 0.01), including microRNAs previously reported as differentially expressed in other human cancers (miR-155, miR-21, miR-221 and miR-222) as well as those not previously reported in cancer (miR-376a and miR-301). Most of the top aberrantly expressed miRNAs displayed increased expression in the tumor. Expression of the active, mature microRNA was validated using a real-time PCR assay to quantify the mature microRNA and Northern blotting. Reverse transcription in situ PCR showed that three of the top differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-221, -376a and -301) were localized to tumor cells and not to stroma or normal acini or ducts. Aberrant microRNA expression may offer new clues to pancreatic tumorigenesis and may provide diagnostic biomarkers for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In this study, we investigate the anti-inflammatory activities of 12 newly synthesized substituted N-[3-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)methyl]-1,2,5,6-tetrahydrobenzamide/benzene sulfonamides (9a?l) in murine BV-2 microglial cells. All compounds were initially screened for attenuation of nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1?µg/mL)-activated microglial cells. The data show that only SO2-substituted THPs were effective at sub-lethal concentrations (IC50 values of 12.92?µM (9i), 14.64?µM (9j), 19.63?µM (9k)) relative to L-N6-(1-iminoethyl)lysine positive control (IC50?=?3.1?µM). The most potent SO2-substituted compound (9i) also blocked the LPS-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and attenuated the release of several cytokines including IL-1α, IL-10, and IL-6. These findings establish the moderate immuno-modulating effects of SO2-substituted THP derivatives.

AB  - ABSTRACT Linear-dendron (LD) hybrids are macromolecules comprising a linear polymer or oligomer conjugated at one or both termini with branched macromolecules called dendrons. Since their introduction approximately 2 decades ago, tremendous progress has been made in their synthesis, the study of their self-assembly, and toward their application in a variety of fields. This highlight is focused on aqueous assemblies of LD hybrids where function is imparted by the dendron, linear component, or both. These functions include the encapsulation and release of drug molecules, enhancement of cell uptake and targeting of specific tissues, and the stabilization of enzymes for catalysis. In addition, many stimuli-responsive LD hybrids that undergo changes in response to light, enzymes, pH, temperature, redox potential, or even multiple stimuli have been developed. LD hybrids can also be used to form networks via cross-linking reactions. Described here are the structure?property relationships underlying the functions of these materials, along with their potential applications. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym.

AB  - Abstract Background Neuropathy can lead not only to impaired function but also to sensory sensitization. We aimed to link reduced skin nerve fibre density in different levels to layer-specific functional impairment in neuropathic pain patients and tried to identify pain-specific functional and structural markers. Methods In 12 healthy controls and 36 patients with neuropathic pain, we assessed clinical characteristics, thermal thresholds (quantitative sensory testing) and electrically induced pain and axon reflex erythema. At the most painful sites and at intra-individual control sites, skin biopsies were taken and innervation densities in the different skin layers were assessed. Moreover, neuronal calcitonin gene-related peptide staining was quantified. Results Perception of warm, cold and heat pain and nerve fibre density were reduced in the painful areas compared with the control sites and with healthy controls. Warm and cold detection thresholds correlated best with epidermal innervation density, whereas heat and cold pain thresholds and axon reflex flare correlated best with dermal innervation density. Clinical pain ratings correlated only with epidermal nerve fibre density (r?=?0.38, p?<?0.05) and better preserved cold detection thresholds (r?=?0.39, p?<?0.05), but not with other assessed functional and structural parameters. Conclusions Thermal thresholds, axon reflex measurements and assessment of skin innervation density are valuable tools to characterize and quantify peripheral neuropathy and link neuronal function to different layers of the skin. The severity of small fibre neuropathy, however, did not correspond to clinical pain intensity and a specific parameter or pattern that would predict pain intensity in peripheral neuropathy could not be identified.

PY  - 2016
AB  - Summary A single determinant factor for autoimmunity does not exist; disease development probably involves contributions from genetics, the environment and immune dysfunction. Type 1 diabetes is no exception. Genomewide-associated studies (GWAS) analysis in T1D has proved disappointing in revealing contributors to disease prediction; the only reliable marker has been human leucocyte antigen (HLA). Specific HLAs include DR3/DR4/DQ2/DQ8, for example. Because HLA molecules present antigen to T cells, it is reasonable that certain HLA molecules have a higher affinity to present self-antigen. Recent studies have shown that additional polymorphisms in HLA that are restricted to autoimmune conditions are further contributory. A caveat is that not all individuals with the appropriate ?pro-autoimmune? HLA develop an autoimmune disease. Another crucial component is autoaggressive T cells. Finding a biomarker to discriminate autoaggressive T cells has been elusive. However, a subset of CD4 helper cells that express the CD40 receptor have been described as becoming pathogenic. An interesting function of CD40 on T cells is to induce the recombination-activating gene (RAG)1/RAG2 T cell receptor recombination machinery. This observation is contrary to immunology paradigms that changes in TCR molecules cannot take place outside the thymic microenvironment. Alteration in TCR, called TCR revision, not only occurs, but may help to account for the development of autoaggressive T cells. Another interesting facet is that type 1 diabetes (T1D) may be more than a single disease; that is, multiple cellular components contribute uniquely, but result ultimately in the same clinical outcome, T1D. This review considers the process of T cell maturation and how that could favor auto-aggressive T cell development in T1D. The potential contribution of TCR revision to autoimmunity is also considered.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2010) 114, 1007?1018. Abstract Wallerian degeneration in peripheral nerves occurs after a traumatic insult when the distal nerve part degenerates while peripheral macrophages enter the nerve stump and remove the accruing debris by phagozytosis. We used an experimental model to investigate the effect of either the absence or over-expression of α-synuclein (α-syn) after transecting the sciatic nerves of mice. α-Synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies and its aggregation results in a premature destruction of nerve cells. It has also been found present in different peripheral nerves but its role in the axon remains still unclear. Following sciatic nerve transection in different mouse strains, we investigated the numbers of invading macrophages, the amounts of remaining myelin and axons 6?days after injury. All mice showed clear signs of Wallerian degeneration, but transgenic mice expressing human wild-type α-syn showed lower numbers of invading macrophages, less preserved myelin and significantly lower numbers of preserved axons in comparison with either knockout mice or a mouse strain with a spontaneous deletion of α-syn. The use of protein aggregation filtration blots and paraffin-embedded tissue blots displayed depositions of α-syn aggregates within sciatic nerve axons of transgenic mice. Thicker myelin sheaths and higher numbers of mitochondria were detected in old α-syn transgenic mice. In a human sural nerve, α-syn could also be identified within axons. Thus, α-syn and its aggregates are not only a component of Lewy bodies and synapses but also of axons and these aggregates might interfere with axonal transport. α-Synuclein transgenic mice represent an appropriate model for investigations on axonal transport in neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Summary Red blood cells (RBCs) degrade progressively during the weeks of refrigerated storage. No universally accepted definition of ?fresh? or ?old? RBCs exists. While practices vary from country to country, preservative solutions permitting shelf life as long as 7 weeks have been licenced. Transfusion of stored RBCs, particularly those at the end of the approved shelf life, has been implicated in adverse clinical outcomes. The results of observational analyses, animal models and studies in volunteers have proved provocative, controversial and contradictory. A recently completed randomized controlled trial (RCT) in premature infants exemplifies the difficulties with moderately sized clinical studies. Several other RCTs are in progress. The effect of RBC storage may well vary according to the clinical setting. Resolution of the importance of the storage lesion may require large pragmatic clinical trials. In the meantime, institutions involved in blood collection and transfusion should explore strategies that assure blood availability, while limiting the use of the oldest RBCs currently approved by regulation.

AB  - Summary Nutrition has become more than just the provision of energy substrates, amino acid building blocks, and maintenance of vitamin and mineral concentrations. It is apparent that certain nutrients (antioxidants, fish oil omega-3 fatty acids, glutamine, arginine, probiotics) and glycemic control exhibit the ability to enhance the immune response to a variety of stressors in critically ill veterinary patients and that their administration may have survival benefit. Acute protein-energy malnutrition predisposes to impaired immune competence; poor wound healing and an increased incidence of dehiscence; an increased incidence of wound infection and systemic sepsis; cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle weakness; and major organ failure and death. In addition, hepatic lipidosis is a common consequence of acute malnutrition in the cat. Enteral feeding should be used any time the intestinal tract (motility, digestion, and absorption) is functional. Enteral nutrition preserves gut epithelial structure and function better than does parenteral nutrition.

AB  - Abstract We demonstrate sodium pyruvate (NaPy) pre-treatment as a successful approach for pressure ulcer (PU) prevention by averting their aetiological origin?cell-level damage and death by large, sustained mechanical loads. We evaluated the NaPy pre-treatment effect on permeability changes in the cell's plasma membrane (PM) following application of in vitro damaging-level strains. Fibroblasts or myoblasts, respectively, models for superficial or deep-tissue damage were grown in 0 or 1?mM NaPy, emulating typical physiological or cell culture conditions. Cells were pre-treated for 4 hours with 0 to 5?mM NaPy prior to 3-hour sustained, damaging-level loads (12% strain). PM permeability was quantified by the cell uptake of small (4 kDa), fluorescent dextran compared with unstrained control using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Pre-treatment with 1?mM, and especially 5?mM, NaPy significantly reduces damage to PM integrity. Long-term NaPy pre-exposure can improve protective treatment, affecting fibroblasts and myoblasts differently. Pre-treating with NaPy, a natural cell metabolite, allows cells under damaging-level mechanical loads to maintain their PM integrity, that is, to avoid loss of homeostasis and inevitable, eventual cell death, by preventing initial, microscale stages of PU formation. This pre-treatment may be applied prior to planned periods of immobility, for example, planned surgery or transport, to prolong safe time in a position by preventing initial cell damage that can cascade and lead to PU formation.

AB  - Abstract Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) are considered a remarkable source for the regeneration of dental pulp tissues, but their therapeutic effectiveness remains limited, especially in elderly people. Previous studies found that senescence has a negative effect on the proliferation and differentiation potential of DPSCs. Moreover, numerous long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and messenger RNA were significantly differentially regulated in DPSCs from young and elderly donors. However, the changes in DPSCs protein during senescence have not been addressed. In this study, differences in DPSC protein expression profiles and coexpression of protein and lncRNA were analyzed using proteomics and bioinformatics. The results showed 75 upregulated proteins and 69 downregulated proteins in DPSCs from elderly donors. Vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and protein export were the top four functional pathways associated with DPSCs. High mobility group N1 (HMGN1), HMGN2, UCHL1, and the family with sequence similarity 96 member B homeobox gene (FAM96B) were associated with DPSCs senescence. Then, we investigated FAM96B function in DPSCs. After FAM96B depletion, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) activity decreased, but the number of senescence-associated ?-galactosidase (SA-?-gal) positive cells and the protein levels of p16, p53 were significantly increased. Gain-of-function assays suggested that FAM96B overexpression was positively correlated with TERT activity, but negatively correlated with the number of SA-?-gal positive cells and the protein levels of P16 and P53. Moreover, after FAM96B overexpression, the results showed a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase activity and an enhanced mineralization ability of DPSCs. The reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction results also showed that dentin sialophosphoprotein and osteocalcin were expressed at greater levels. The carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) results displayed that FAM96B increased the proliferation potential of DPSCs. Our study revealed candidate proteins that might be related to DPSCs senescence and provided information to elucidate the mechanism of the biological changes in DPSCs' aging. Moreover, FAM96B was demonstrated to play an important role in suppressing DPSCs senescence and promoting osteogenic differentiation and proliferation.

AB  - ABSTRACT Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation has shown great promises for treating various central nervous system (CNS) diseases. However, poor viability of transplanted MSCs in injured CNS has limited the therapeutic efficiency. Oxidative stress is one of major mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of CNS diseases and has a negative impact on the survival of transplanted MSCs. Melatonin has recently been reported to have the antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties in serial of cells. This study was designed to investigate the protective effect and potential mechanisms of melatonin against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced apoptosis of MSCs. MSCs were pretreated with melatonin (1, 10, and 100?nM, respectively) for 30?min, followed by exposure to 400?µM H2O2 and melatonin together for 12?h. The present study reports that melatonin pretreatment significantly attenuated H2O2-induced MSC apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Consistently, melatonin effectively suppressed the generation of intracellular ROS, expression ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, activation of caspase-3 and expression of phospho-P38MAPK in H2O2-induced MSCs. Luzindole, a nonselective melatonin receptor antagonist, significantly counteracted melatonin's promotion effect on cell survival, indicating that melatonin exerts its protective effect on MSCs, at least in part, through the activation of melatonin receptors. The findings suggest that melatonin may be an effectively protective agent against oxidative stress-induced MSC apoptosis. J. Cell. Biochem. 114: 2346?2355, 2013. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
