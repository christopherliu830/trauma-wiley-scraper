AB  - ABSTRACT Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation has shown great promises for treating various central nervous system (CNS) diseases. However, poor viability of transplanted MSCs in injured CNS has limited the therapeutic efficiency. Oxidative stress is one of major mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of CNS diseases and has a negative impact on the survival of transplanted MSCs. Melatonin has recently been reported to have the antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties in serial of cells. This study was designed to investigate the protective effect and potential mechanisms of melatonin against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced apoptosis of MSCs. MSCs were pretreated with melatonin (1, 10, and 100?nM, respectively) for 30?min, followed by exposure to 400?µM H2O2 and melatonin together for 12?h. The present study reports that melatonin pretreatment significantly attenuated H2O2-induced MSC apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Consistently, melatonin effectively suppressed the generation of intracellular ROS, expression ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, activation of caspase-3 and expression of phospho-P38MAPK in H2O2-induced MSCs. Luzindole, a nonselective melatonin receptor antagonist, significantly counteracted melatonin's promotion effect on cell survival, indicating that melatonin exerts its protective effect on MSCs, at least in part, through the activation of melatonin receptors. The findings suggest that melatonin may be an effectively protective agent against oxidative stress-induced MSC apoptosis. J. Cell. Biochem. 114: 2346?2355, 2013. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract We report on a 5-year-old female born to consanguineous parents, ascertained at the age of 23?months for an elevated plasma methionine level, a mildly abnormal total plasma homocysteine (tHcy), and elevated aminotransferases. She had global developmental delay, microcephaly, dysmorphic facial features, hypotonia, nystagmus and tremor in her upper extremities. Metabolic investigations demonstrated elevations in plasma methionine, plasma S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and plasma S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), with normal urine adenosine levels. Some of the elevations persisted for over 1?year. Sequencing of the ADK and AHCY genes was negative for causative variants. Plasma methionine normalized 1?year after ascertainment, but SAM and SAH continued to be elevated for six more months before normalization, and aminotransferases remained mildly elevated. Whole exome sequencing demonstrated a homozygous pathogenic variant; NM_018297.3(NGLY1):c.1405C>T (p.Arg469*) in exon 9 of the NGLY1 gene, for which both parents were heterozygous. To our knowledge, this is the first report of NGLY1 deficiency with elevations in plasma methionine, SAM and SAH and a slight elevation of tHcy. Less than 20 patients have been reported with NGLY1 deficiency worldwide and this case expands on the biochemical phenotype of this newly discovered inborn error of metabolism.

AB  - Abstract Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) are considered a remarkable source for the regeneration of dental pulp tissues, but their therapeutic effectiveness remains limited, especially in elderly people. Previous studies found that senescence has a negative effect on the proliferation and differentiation potential of DPSCs. Moreover, numerous long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and messenger RNA were significantly differentially regulated in DPSCs from young and elderly donors. However, the changes in DPSCs protein during senescence have not been addressed. In this study, differences in DPSC protein expression profiles and coexpression of protein and lncRNA were analyzed using proteomics and bioinformatics. The results showed 75 upregulated proteins and 69 downregulated proteins in DPSCs from elderly donors. Vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and protein export were the top four functional pathways associated with DPSCs. High mobility group N1 (HMGN1), HMGN2, UCHL1, and the family with sequence similarity 96 member B homeobox gene (FAM96B) were associated with DPSCs senescence. Then, we investigated FAM96B function in DPSCs. After FAM96B depletion, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) activity decreased, but the number of senescence-associated ?-galactosidase (SA-?-gal) positive cells and the protein levels of p16, p53 were significantly increased. Gain-of-function assays suggested that FAM96B overexpression was positively correlated with TERT activity, but negatively correlated with the number of SA-?-gal positive cells and the protein levels of P16 and P53. Moreover, after FAM96B overexpression, the results showed a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase activity and an enhanced mineralization ability of DPSCs. The reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction results also showed that dentin sialophosphoprotein and osteocalcin were expressed at greater levels. The carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) results displayed that FAM96B increased the proliferation potential of DPSCs. Our study revealed candidate proteins that might be related to DPSCs senescence and provided information to elucidate the mechanism of the biological changes in DPSCs' aging. Moreover, FAM96B was demonstrated to play an important role in suppressing DPSCs senescence and promoting osteogenic differentiation and proliferation.

AB  - Abstract Locally administered steroids have a long history in ophthalmology for the treatment of inflammatory conditions. Anterior segment conditions tend to be treated with topical steroids whilst posterior segment conditions generally require periocular, intravitreal or systemic administration for penetration. Over recent decades, the clinical applications of periocular steroid delivery have expanded to a wide range of conditions including macular oedema from retino-vascular conditions. Formulations have been developed with the aim to provide practical, targeted, longer-term and more efficacious therapy whilst minimizing side effects. Herein, we provide a comprehensive overview of the types of periocular steroid delivery, their clinical applications in ophthalmology and their side effects.

AB  - Abstract The improvement of fat graft viability might depend on the presence of multipotent resident adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) which is the important component of stromal vascular fraction (SVF). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiogenin-1 (Ang-1) are responsible for neovascularization. However, their half-life is too short to produce a biological effect. We thus investigated whether VEGF-ANG-1-polylactic acid (PLA) microspheres could enhance the angiogenic properties of ADSCs. PLA microspheres containing VEGF and ANG-1 were prepared by in vitro ultrasonic emulsification and characterized according to their encapsulation efficiency (EE), drug-loading rate (DL), particle size, and drug release. The systemic toxicity of empty loaded nanospheres (NPs) and the ability of these microspheres to promote the proliferation and differentiation of ADSCs were evaluated. The EE and DL were above 86 and 2.8%, respectively. The drug release was completed after 20 days. Systemic toxicity was verified in ADSCs that received the unloaded NPs. It was observed that ADSCs treated with VEGF-ANG-1-PLA microspheres had an increase in the proliferation and the number of CD31 positive cells. ADSCs proliferation and differentiation toward endothelial cells (ECs) could be enhanced by the addition of VEGF-ANG-1-PLA nano-sustained release microspheres.

AB  - Abstract Bone tissue engineering (BTE) has received significant attention due to its enormous potential in treating critical-sized bone defects and related diseases. Traditional materials such as metals, ceramics, and polymers have been widely applied as BTE scaffolds; however, their clinical applications have been rather limited due to various considerations. Recently, carbon-based nanomaterials attract significant interests for their applications as BTE scaffolds due to their superior properties, including excellent mechanical strength, large surface area, tunable surface functionalities, high biocompatibility as well as abundant and inexpensive nature. In this article, recent studies and advancements on the use of carbon-based nanomaterials with different dimensions such as graphene and its derivatives, carbon nanotubes, and carbon dots, for BTE are reviewed. Current challenges of carbon-based nanomaterials for BTE and future trends in BTE scaffolds development are also highlighted and discussed.

AB  - In comparison to hypotonia, hypertonia is less commonly expressed in the neonatal period. The scientific literature on the causes of neonatal hypertonia is scant, with no suggested diagnostic algorithm easily available to clinicians. Aetiologies include conditions affecting the central nervous system and spine, and rare peripheral neuromuscular disorders leading to hypertonia. Aetiology onset may be antepartum, peripartum with either transient hypertonia or persistent hypertonia which may appear later, or from a postnatal event/disease. This review discusses neonatal hypertonia and a diagnostic approach to neonatal hypertonia is suggested.

AB  - Abstract Background Ocular surface diseases are among the most frequent ocular pathologies. Ocular pain following corneal injury is frequently observed in clinic. Corneal sensory innervation is supplied by ciliary nerves derived from ophthalmic division of the trigeminal ganglion. Methods & Results Extracellular activity of the mouse ciliary nerve was first used to investigate the corneal responsiveness to chemical, mechanical and thermal stimulations in order to specifically study the responses of polymodal nociceptors, mechano-nociceptors and cold thermoreceptor in a control cornea. Then, in two models of corneal injury (repeated instillations of 0.02% benzalkonium chloride and corneal scraping), we first measured the corneal sensitivity to chemical (eye-wiping test) and mechanical (von Frey filaments) stimulation. Thereafter, we evaluated whether these corneal injuries modified the spontaneous and chemical stimulation-evoked activity of the ciliary nerve. Both models of injury induced a significant corneal chemical hypersensitivity correlated with an increase of the spontaneous activity of the ciliary nerve and a faster response of the ciliary nerve after a chemical stimulation. Conclusions Overall, this study provides new insights into the functional aspects of corneal nerve fibre activity in mice after corneal injury. The increase in ciliary nerve activity may thus contribute to the development of ocular pain after corneal damage. Significance This study highlights the parallel increase in ciliary nerve activity and corneal sensitivity after corneal injury in mice. The strategy of combining ex vivo electrophysiological recordings of the ciliary nerve in mice and corneal sensitivity measurements therefore helps to uncover the functional aspects of corneal pain.

AB  - One of the main functions of the dental pulp is the formation of dentin. When the pulp undergoes pathological changes before complete root development, normal root growth is disrupted. If the pulp is reversibly inflamed due to caries or exposure, the treatment of choice is to maintain pulp vitality by pulp capping or pulpotomy. If the pulp is irreversibly inflamed or necrotic, traditional apexification procedures consist of multiple and long-term applications of calcium hydroxide in order to create an apical barrier that aids in root canal obturation. Recently, artificial apical barriers using mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) have been introduced. In addition, pulp regeneration (revascularization) has received attention as an option for such teeth. That topic will be addressed in the next chapter. In this review, we will give a brief description of the embryology of root development, major causes of pulpal inflammation, factors affecting treatment planning, and tests for diagnosing pulpal conditions. This will be followed by a comprehensive literature review from 1908 through June 2010 regarding the definition, history, materials used, animal and human studies, mechanisms of action, prognosis, as well as advantages and disadvantages of apexogenesis by pulp capping and pulpotomy.

AB  - Abstract Growth differentiation factor 8 (GDF8)/myostatin is a latent TGF-? family member that potently inhibits skeletal muscle growth. Here, we compared the conformation and dynamics of precursor, latent, and Tolloid-cleaved GDF8 pro-complexes to understand structural mechanisms underlying latency and activation of GDF8. Negative stain electron microscopy (EM) of precursor and latent pro-complexes reveals a V-shaped conformation that is unaltered by furin cleavage and sharply contrasts with the ring-like, cross-armed conformation of latent TGF-?1. Surprisingly, Tolloid-cleaved GDF8 does not immediately dissociate, but in EM exhibits structural heterogeneity consistent with partial dissociation. Hydrogen?deuterium exchange was not affected by furin cleavage. In contrast, Tolloid cleavage, in the absence of prodomain?growth factor dissociation, increased exchange in regions that correspond in pro-TGF-?1 to the α1-helix, latency lasso, and ?1-strand in the prodomain and to the ?6?- and ?7?-strands in the growth factor. Thus, these regions are important in maintaining GDF8 latency. Our results show that Tolloid cleavage activates latent GDF8 by destabilizing specific prodomain?growth factor interfaces and primes the growth factor for release from the prodomain.
