AB  - Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a life-sustaining therapy providing nutrients to individuals with impaired intestinal tract function and enteral access challenges. It is one of the most complex prescriptions written routinely in the hospital and home care settings. This article is to aid the nutrition support clinician in the safe provision of PN, including selecting appropriate patients for PN, vascular access, development of a PN admixture, appropriate therapy monitoring, recognition of preparation options, and awareness of preparation and stability concerns.

AB  - Abstract This unit describes methods for intravital imaging of monocytes in the vasculature of the dermis and the mesentery in vivo using fluorescent reporter mice, fluorescent dyes, and antibodies. Cx3cr1gfp/gfp (or +), Rag2?/?, Il2rg?/? mice expressing eGFP at the locus of the Cx3cr1 gene, on the Rag2?/? Il2rg?/? C57Bl/6 background, are used. Although aimed at specifically tracking Ly6Clow monocytes, these protocols could readily be adapted to investigate the interaction of other blood leukocytes with the vascular endothelium by use of other fluorescent reporter mice and fluorescently labeled antibodies.

AB  - Abstract L-type voltage-gated calcium ion channels (L-VGCCs) have been demonstrated to be the mediator of several significant intracellular activities in excitable cells, such as neurons, chromaffin cells and myocytes. Recently, an increasing number of studies have investigated the function of L-VGCCs in non-excitable cells, particularly stem cells. However, there appear to be no systematic reviews of the relationship between L-VGCCs and stem cells, and filling this gap is prescient considering the contribution of L-VGCCs to the proliferation and differentiation of several types of stem cells. This review will discuss the possible involvement of L-VGCCs in stem cells, mainly focusing on osteogenesis mediated by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from different tissues and neurogenesis mediated by neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs). Additionally, advanced applications that use these channels as the target for tissue engineering, which may offer the hope of tissue regeneration in the future, will also be explored.

AB  - Background: In 2006, legislative changes enabled independent prescribers to prescribe any licensed medication within their field of expertise. This has transformed nurse prescribing and opened up more opportunities for nurses to develop their practice in acute care settings. The need for further evaluation in this developing area of advanced practice was highlighted in the British Association of Critical Care Nurses (BACCN) position statement published in 2009. Aims: The aims of this audit were to describe the prescribing practices of nurses working in a critical care outreach (CCO) team by exploring: which medications were prescribed; the number of prescribing decisions being made and if prescribing practice changed during the out of hours period. The findings can be used to inform practice, develop CCO services, provide a basis for further research, and contribute to the debate in this developing area of CCO practice. Methods: The prescribing practices of two independent non-medical prescribers in a CCO team were audited from January to April 2011. Results: The findings showed that; there were a wide range of medications prescribed, that prescribing decisions increased over time and that the majority of prescriptions were written out of hours. Conclusions: This preliminary audit has shown that prescribing in a CCO setting which covers a wide patient population is manageable. By evaluating drug prescribing patterns, a ?critical care outreach formulary? can be developed to guide individuals and the team in their continuing professional and service development. The CCO teams ability to prescribe could have the potential to improve the patients' experience and outcome, and positively affect the efficiency of service delivery; however, an increase in CCO referrals can have an impact on the CCO service resource. Further evaluation and study are needed to explore this developing area of critical care delivery.

AB  - Abdominal wall hernia is a recurrent issue world-wide and requires the implantation of over 1 million meshes per year. Because permanent meshes such as polypropylene and polyester are not free of complications after implantation, many mesh modifications and new functionalities have been investigated over the last decade. Indeed, mesh optimization is the focus of intense development and the biomaterials utilized are now envisioned as being bioactive substrates that trigger various physiological processes in order to prevent complications and to promote tissue integration. In this context, it is of paramount interest to review the most relevant bio-functionalities being brought to new meshes and to open new avenues for the innovative development of the next generation of meshes with enhanced properties for functional abdominal wall hernia repair.
