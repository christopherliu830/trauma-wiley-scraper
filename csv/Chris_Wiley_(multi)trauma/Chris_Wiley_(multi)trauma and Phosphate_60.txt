AB  - Background The medications produced from natural products are widely used as prophylactics for sickness induced by alcohol consumption. One such prophylactic is produced from the Reishi mushroom, Ganoderma lucidum. Because of the antioxidant properties of these preparations, we expect neuroprotective prophylactic effects of Reishi-based medications in alcohol-treated animals. Methods The Reishi (R) suspension was produced as water extract from Altaian mushrooms. Sprague?Dawley male rats were separated into the following 3 experimental groups: Group A + R received R (6 days per week) starting 1 week before alcohol exposure, and during the next 3 weeks, they received both R and alcohol; group A received alcohol; and group C received water. At the end of experiment, we determined the metabolic profile using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) of the brain cortex and phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the liver. Additionally, the blood cells were collected, and the serum biochemistry and liver histology were performed after euthanasia. Results Partial least squares discriminant analysis processing of the brain 1H MRS gave 2 axes, the Y1 axis positively correlated with the level of taurine and negatively correlated with the level of lactate, and the Y2 axis positively correlated with the content of GABA and glycine and negatively correlated with the sum of the excitatory neurotransmitters, glutamate and glutamine. The Y1 values reflecting the brain energetics for the A + R group exceeded the corresponding values for groups C and A. The maximal level of Y2 reflecting the prevalence of inhibitory metabolites in the brain was observed in the rats exposed to alcohol. Moderate alcohol consumption did not cause significant pathological changes in the livers of the experimental animals. However, 20 days of alcohol consumption significantly increased the number of binuclear hepatocytes compared to the control. This effect was mitigated in the rats that received the Reishi extract. Conclusions Regular administration of the Reishi suspension improved the energy supply to the brain cortex and decreased the prevalence of inhibitory neurotransmitters that are characteristic of alcohol consumption. The alcohol-induced increase in liver proliferation was significantly suppressed by regular administration of the G. lucidum water suspension.

AB  - Abstract Although much progress has been made in the treatment of gliomas, the prognosis for patients with gliomas is still very poor. Stem cell-based therapies may be promising options for glioma treatment. Recently, many studies have reported that umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (UC-MSCs) are ideal gene vehicles for tumor gene therapy. Interleukin 24 (IL-24) is a pleiotropic immunoregulatory cytokine that has an apoptotic effect on many kinds of tumor cells and can inhibit the growth of tumors specifically without damaging normal cells. In this study, we investigated UC-MSCs as a vehicle for the targeted delivery of IL-24 to tumor sites. UC-MSCs were transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying green fluorescent protein (GFP) or IL-24 complementary DNA. The results indicated that UC-MSCs could selectively migrate to glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. Injection of IL-24-UC-MSCs significantly suppressed tumor growth of glioma xenografts. The restrictive efficacy of IL-24-UC-MSCs was associated with the inhibition of proliferation as well as the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells. These findings indicate that UC-MSC-based IL-24 gene therapy may be able to suppress the growth of glioma xenografts, thereby suggesting possible future therapeutic use in the treatment of gliomas.

The patient presented signs of hypocalcemia accompanied by generalized bone pain and a femoral mass. Further evaluation revealed secondary hyperparathyroidism, highly elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, and generalized sclerotic and lytic lesions. Biopsy confirmed osteosarcomatosis. Despite aggressive chemotherapy, he died from progressive disease 2 months after diagnosis. The course of disease in this patient suggests that hypocalcemia reflects a poor prognosis.

AB  - Summary Tattooing has been around since the early beginnings of modern civilization. The discovery of selective photothermolysis at last has made it possible to remove tattoos without leaving a scar. Q-switched neodymium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet, alexandrite, and ruby lasers with pulse durations in the nanosecond domain fulfill this need. Argon or cw-CO2 lasers as well as intense pulsed light sources should not be used since they often produce significant scarring. This article provides an overview of current laser systems.Developments leading to new tattoo inks, feedback systems to detect the absorbance characteristics of tattoo inks, dermal clearing agents, and perhaps even lasers with shorter pulse-durations might improve the results in the future.

AB  - In connection with an osteological study of more than one hundred complete, disarticulated skeletons of the Norwegian Fjord and D?le horse breeds in the collection of the University Museum of Bergen, attention was drawn to the ossified parts of the rib cartilages because of frequent healed fractures transverse to the cartilages. Unossified cartilage had been removed, so the ossified cartilages were available as dry specimens. The skeletons derive from pedigreed stallions as well as some few mares, so both name, year of birth and age are known. Most often the age was between 15 and 30?years, but some few horses were younger, the youngest 5-year-old. Ocular inspection of each skeleton revealed that healed fractures occurred in ossified rib cartilages of every horse, varying from some few instances to >30. Skeletons of horses of other races in the museum collection corroborated this. Healing of the fractures was obvious. Four kinds were observed: The first, and probably least sincere fracture appeared as a visible transverse ring, the second displayed callus elevation around the fracture, the third showed dislocation and callus formation, and the fourth concerns pseudoarthrosis, when fractured parts fail to unite during healing. Even a fifth kind may be considered, with circumferential callus formation leaving the interior healed but unfused. X-ray displays the fractures as white, cross-sectional bands of bone repair. However, such fractures appear not to be considered in contemporary veterinary pathology, but the large number of fractures observed in some cases, callus formation and dislocation of fractures in others, indicates that some period following these fractures is likely to have been traumatic to the horse, so that fracture of ossified rib cartilages should not be ruled out concerning horses showing unexplained symptoms of pain.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aims: Patients with coagulation factor disorders require lifelong symptomatic treatment. This is associated with limited efficacy and transmission risks. From a clinical point of view, hepatocyte transplantation offers a rational alternative but is currently being hampered by lack of functional stability of engrafted cells. It was the aim of our study to devise culture conditions providing stable cell polarity, attachment and growth factor stimulation to improve longevity and coagulation factor production. Methods: Human hepatocytes (HC) were plated on different extracellular matrices, inside collagen gel or Matrigel. HC were grown inside growth factor-enriched serum-free medium (SFM) or exposed to media switching from differentiation (DM) to dedifferentiation (DeDM). Results: Over more than 30 days in vitro human HC synthesized coagulation factors (factors VII, VIII, IX, fibrinogen) and coagulation inhibitors (antithrombin III, protein C). Protein synthesis was augmented when HC were grown inside a 3D collagen type I matrix, while Matrigel showed no additional benefit. Soluble growth factors improved coagulation factor production when applied in SFM or in sequential DM/DeDM. Coagulation factor levels ranged from 3% to 12% in the first week to 2.5?5% after 4 weeks, reaching biologically relevant levels. Conclusion: Preserved synthesis and secretion of coagulation factors in balanced proportion by human HC in this model may offer new perspectives for HC transplantation in coagulation defects of patients.
