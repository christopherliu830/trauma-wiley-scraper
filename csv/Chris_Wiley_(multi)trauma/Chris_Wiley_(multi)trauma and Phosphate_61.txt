AB  - Abstract Sucralfate is a site-protective ulcer healing drug with a remarkable range of mechanisms of action. Recent studies highlight the capacity of sucralfate to bind basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and deliver it in high concentration to the ulcer. Basic fibroblast growth factor stimulates the production of granulation tissue, angiogenesis and re-epithelization, thus improving the quality of ulcer healing. The effect of sucralfate in reducing parietal cell sensitivity may be another factor important in the lower relapse rate demonstrated after duodenal ulcer healing. Sucralfate has been demonstrated to be efficacious in healing both duodenal and gastric ulcers together with mild oesophagitis, and it is safe for both short-term use and maintenance. In stress ulcer prophylaxis it is as effective as acid suppression or neutralization and has the advantage of lesser rates of nosocomial pneumonia than are demonstrated with antacids or H2 antagonists. The potential advantages of sucralfate lie in the better quality of ulcer healing associated with longer duration of remission.

AB  - Abstract Neuropeptides with C-terminal RFamide and their receptors NPFF1 (FF1) and NPFF2 (FF2) have been implicated in a wide variety of functions, including nociception and autonomic and neuroendocrine regulation. Recent studies indicate that the FF1, but not FF2, mRNA is highly expressed in the human hypothalamus. In the present study, localization of FF1 in the human hypothalamus and surrounding regions was studied immunohistochemically by using an antibody against human FF1 (hFF1). Brain sections from healthy 30?50-year-old individuals were used for hFF1 immunohistochemistry. The highest density of hFF1-stained cells was found in the posterior division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and in the zona incerta. A moderate density of cells was observed in the perifornical nucleus, infundibular nucleus, tuberomammillary nucleus, and lateral tuberal nucleus. A lesser density was revealed in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, basal nucleus of Meynert, and anterior amygdaloid area. Only scattered hFF1 cells were found in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. hFF1 cells and fibers were absent in the supraoptic and mammillary nuclei. Single and double strands of hFF1-immunopositive punctate varicosities marked cellular processes of different caliber. The density of hFF1-immunostained fiber networks did not always coincide with that of hFF1-immunostained cells. hFF1 immunoreactivity was also found in the wall of blood vessels within most brain areas studied. Localization of hFF1 in discrete regions of the hypothalamus and extended amygdala may provide important insights into the role of amidated neuropeptides in central autonomic and neuroendocrine control in the human brain.

AB  - Abstract One of the most overlooked of all serious complications of diabetes is cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy. There is now clear evidence that suggests activation of inflammatory cytokines in diabetic patients and that these correlate with abnormalities in sympathovagal balance. Dysfunction of the autonomic system predicts cardiovascular risk and sudden death in patients with type 2 diabetes. It also occurs in prediabetes, providing opportunities for early intervention. Simple tests that can be carried out at the bedside with real-time output of information ? within the scope of the practicing physician ? facilitate diagnosis and allow the application of sound strategies for management. The window of opportunity for aggressive control of all the traditional risk factors for cardiovascular events or sudden death with intensification of therapy is with short duration diabetes, the absence of cardiovascular disease and a history of severe hypoglycemic events. To this list we can now add autonomic dysfunction and neuropathy, which have become the most powerful predictors of risk for mortality. It seems prudent that practitioners should be encouraged to become familiar with this information and apply risk stratification in clinical practice. Several agents have become available for the correction of functional defects in the autonomic nervous system, and restoration of autonomic balance is now possible.

AB  - Abstract Musculoskeletal reconstruction is an ongoing challenge for surgeons as it is required for one out of five patients undergoing surgery. In the past three decades, through the close collaboration between clinicians and basic scientists, several regenerative strategies have been proposed. These have emerged from interdisciplinary approaches that bridge tissue engineering with material science, physiology, and cell biology. The paradigm behind tissue engineering is to achieve regeneration and functional recovery using stem cells, bioactive molecules, or supporting materials. Although plenty of preclinical solutions for bone and cartilage have been presented, only a few platforms have been able to move from the bench to the bedside. In this review, we highlight the limitations of musculoskeletal regeneration and summarize the most relevant acellular tissue engineering approaches. We focus on the strategies that could be most effectively translate in clinical practice and reflect on contemporary and cutting-edge regenerative strategies in surgery.

AB  - Abstract Human adipose tissue is an ideal source of autologous cells that is both plentiful and easily obtainable in large quantities through the simple surgical procedure of liposuction. The stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue contains a stem cell population, adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), capable of adipogenic, osteogenic, myogenic and chondrogenic differentiation. These cells have already been recognized to possess great therapeutic potential in tissue engineering and regeneration. In this study, we sought to determine the effect of donor age on the growth kinetics and differentiation potential of ASCs. For this, ASCs were isolated from liposuctioned adipose tissue obtained from female patients in the age range 20?58 years. Population doubling time was calculated over 2 weeks and differentiation potential was determined by assaying for adipogenesis and osteogenesis. ASCs obtained from older donors appeared to have a slower rate of proliferation, but this relationship was not significant. While adipogenic potential was unrelated to donor age, a distinct relationship between donor age and osteogenic potential was observed. The aetiology of this age-dependent change in osteogenic potential was not due to any changes in the number of precursors with osteogenic capacity in the adipose sample. These findings have important implications for emerging cell-based therapeutic strategies, such as tissue engineering, in addition to treatment of various metabolic bone disorders including osteoporosis.
