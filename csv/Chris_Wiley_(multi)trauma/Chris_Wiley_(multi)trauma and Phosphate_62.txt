AB  - Abstract Musculoskeletal reconstruction is an ongoing challenge for surgeons as it is required for one out of five patients undergoing surgery. In the past three decades, through the close collaboration between clinicians and basic scientists, several regenerative strategies have been proposed. These have emerged from interdisciplinary approaches that bridge tissue engineering with material science, physiology, and cell biology. The paradigm behind tissue engineering is to achieve regeneration and functional recovery using stem cells, bioactive molecules, or supporting materials. Although plenty of preclinical solutions for bone and cartilage have been presented, only a few platforms have been able to move from the bench to the bedside. In this review, we highlight the limitations of musculoskeletal regeneration and summarize the most relevant acellular tissue engineering approaches. We focus on the strategies that could be most effectively translate in clinical practice and reflect on contemporary and cutting-edge regenerative strategies in surgery.

AB  - Abstract There is a need for analytical methods capable of monitoring blood antibiotic levels in real time. Here we present a method for quantifying antibiotic levels in whole blood that does not require any sample pretreatment. The tests employ the enzyme penicillinase to assay for penicillin G, penicillin V and ampicillin using a flow-injected biosensor, the Enzyme Thermistor. Optimal flow rates, sample volumes and pH were determined to be 0.5 mL/min, 100 ?L and 7.0, respectively. Analysis of the antibiotics diluted in buffer gave a linear range of 0.17?5.0 mM. Calibration curves prepared using blood spiked with the antibiotics gave a linear range of 0.17?2.0 mM. Linear regression values for all of the calibration curves were 0.998 or higher. Assay cycle time was 5 min. The relative standard deviation value for 100 determinations of a mock blood sample spiked with penicillin G was 6.71%. Despite the elimination of sample pretreatment, no detectable clogging or signal drift was observed. The assay provides a fast, simple, reliable analytical method for determining antibiotic concentrations in blood without the need for any sample pretreatment. This is an important first step towards developing a device capable of real-time monitoring of antibiotic levels in whole blood. The technology has the potential to significantly improve the outcomes of patients undergoing critical care.

AB  - Abstract The aim was to evaluate the effect of HTK compared to UW and Euro?Collins (EC) on the initial graft function and long term graft survival in two prospective randomized studies. Only kidneys from heart-beating, kidney-only or kidney + heart donors were eligible for entry. Initial non-function (INF) was defined as the absence of life-sustaining renal function, requiring dialysis treatment on two or more occasions, during the first week after transplantation. To evaluate the contribution of the preservation solutions on INF in relation to other factors, a multivariate, 2-step logistic regression model was used. Randomization was performed between July 1990 and September 1992. The UW-HTK study comprised 342 donors and 611 transplants (UW: 168 donors and 297 transplants, HTK: 174 donors and 314 transplants). In the EC-HTK study 317 donors and 569 transplants were included (EC: 155 donors and 277 transplants, HTK: 162 donors and 292 transplants). INF occurred in 33 % of either HTK-(n = 105) or UW-(n= 99) preserved kidneys (P = NS), and in 29% of the HTK-(n= 85) and in 43% of the EC-(n= 119) preserved kidneys (P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed no significant influence of the preservation solution on the incidence of INF in the UW-HTK study, but factors contributing to INF were donor age, cause of death, retransplantation, and cold ischemic period. The EC-HTK study showed a significantly higher risk of INF, using EC as preservation, in addition to cold ischemic period and donor quality. The 3-year graft survival of HTK-preserved kidneys was 73 %, compared to 68 % for UW?preserved kidneys in the UW-HTK study (P = NS); while the 3-year graft survival of HTK preserved kidneys was 70 % compared to 67 % for EC-preserved kidneys in the EC-HTK study (P = NS). We can conclude that HTK is comparable to UW in its preservative abilities, using kidneys from heart-beating kidney-only donors, whereas EC as renal preservation solution should be avoided.

AB  - This single-blind, 8-week study compared the efficacy of a sonic toothbrush and a manual brush in 40 patients with adult periodontitis. Qualitative clinical indices and quantitative laboratory methods were used to monitor the periodontal status of 3 pockets 5 to 7 mm deep in each subject. Patients were randomly assigned either a sonic or manual toothbrush. The two groups were comparable with respect to age, gender, and anatomical location of the test sites. Data were collected from all sites at baseline and at 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Over the 8-week period, both groups showed significant improvements in the clinical indices used. Descriptive statistics indicated the sonic brush group had greater improvement than the manual group in the clinical parameters (gingival index, bleeding index, probing depth, and clinical attachment level). Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) flow was significantly lower in the sonic brush group (P = 0.018). Considerable variation was present in the levels detected for both inflammatory cytokines tested, however, concentration of interleukin-1 beta was significantly lower in the GCF of sonic group patients (P = 0.05), while concentration of interleukin-6 was significantly reduced in both groups (P ≤ 0.05) (t tests). Under these conditions, there is some evidence to suggest that the sonic toothbrush is more beneficial in resolving inflammation in patients with moderate periodontal disease.
