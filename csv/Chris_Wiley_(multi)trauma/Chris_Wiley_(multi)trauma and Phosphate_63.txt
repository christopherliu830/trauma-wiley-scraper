AB  - Abstract The aim of this review is to discuss the role of medicaments and materials used in teeth undergoing root canal treatment and how they affect the overall prognosis of root canal treated teeth. Irrigants, medicaments and materials play a vital role in RCT. They reduce the overall microbial load within the root canal system, help reduce inter-appointment pain, and induce apexification during RCT of permanent teeth with immature apices. In addition, they also help create a hermetic coronal and periradicular seal to entomb any residual microorganisms within the canals and prevent future ingress of contaminants into the root canal system and subsequent reinfection. Whilst the role of various materials in RCT has been thoroughly investigated, the available literature and longitudinal clinical studies evaluating the affect of such materials on the prognosis of RCT is scarce, and requires further investigation.

This review explores the current understanding of the nature of biofilms and the impact that molecular interactions between the bacteria themselves, as well as between bacteria and the host, may have on biofilm development and phenotype using the nonmotile Gram-positive coccus, Staphylococcus aureus, as an example.

AB  - Abstract Mechanically ventilated patients are unable to take food orally and therefore are dependent on enteral nutrition for provision of both energy and protein requirements. Enteral nutrition is supportive therapy and may impact patient outcomes in the intensive care unit. Early enteral nutrition has been shown to decrease complications and hospital length of stay and improve the prognosis at discharge. Nutrition support is unique for patients on mechanical ventilation and, as recently published literature shows, should be tailored to the individuals? underlying pathology. This review will discuss the most current literature and recommendations for enteral nutrition in patients receiving mechanical ventilation.

AB  - Abstract Plasma fibronectin (pFN) plays a crucial role in wound healing by binding to integrins and inducing cell migration. It is known to induce the migration and proliferation of mesenchymal progenitor cells in vitro, which play a key role during microfracture in cartilage repair. Endogenous chondrocytes from the native cartilage of the defect rim might aid in cartilage repair. In this study, the effect of pFN on proliferation, migration, and differentiation was tested on human articular chondrocytes. Results showed that treatment with pFN increased the migration of chondrocytes in a range of 1?30 ?g/ml as tested with no effect on proliferation. TGF?3-induced chondrogenesis was not affected by pFN. Especially, gene expression of matrix metalloproteinases was not increased by pFN. Plasma FN fragmentation due to storage conditions could be excluded by SDS-PAGE. Moreover, bioactivity of pFN did not alter during storage at 4°C and 40°C for up to 14 days. Taken together, pFN induces the migration but not proliferation of human articular chondrocytes with no inhibitory effect on chondrogenic differentiation. Additionally, no loss of activity or fragmentation of pFN was observed after lyophilization and storage, making pFN an interesting bioactive factor for chondrocyte recruitment.

AB  - Abstract Electrospinning technology has been widely used in the past few decades to prepare nanofibrous scaffolds that mimic extracellular matrices. However, traditional two-dimensional (2D) electrospun nanofibrous mats still have some inherent disadvantages for bone tissue engineering, such as limited cell infiltration and lack of three-dimensional (3D) structure. The development of 3D electrospun scaffolds with larger pore sizes and porosity provides new perspectives for electrospinning-based tissue engineering scaffolds. However, there are still some challenges and areas for improvement. In this review, the applications of 3D electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds in the field of bone tissue engineering from its fabrication methods to bio-functionalization are summarized, with the aim of providing new insights into the design of electrospinning-based bone tissue engineering scaffolds.

AB  - Abstract The aim of regenerative engineering is to restore complex tissues and biological systems through convergence in the fields of advanced biomaterials, stem cell science, and developmental biology. Hydrogels are one of the most attractive biomaterials for regenerative engineering, since they can be engineered into tissue mimetic 3D scaffolds to support cell growth due to their similarity to native extracellular matrix. Advanced nano- and micro-technologies have dramatically increased the ability to control properties and functionalities of hydrogel materials by facilitating biomimetic fabrication of more sophisticated compositions and architectures, thus extending our understanding of cell-matrix interactions at the nanoscale. With this perspective, this review discusses the most commonly used hydrogel materials and their fabrication strategies for regenerative engineering. We highlight the physical, chemical, and functional modulation of hydrogels to design and engineer biomimetic tissues based on recent achievements in nano- and micro-technologies. In addition, current hydrogel-based regenerative engineering strategies for treating multiple tissues, such as musculoskeletal, nervous and cardiac tissue, are also covered in this review. The interaction of multiple disciplines including materials science, cell biology, and chemistry, will further play an important role in the design of functional hydrogels for the regeneration of complex tissues.

AB  - Abstract The effects of transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1 on expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its high-affinity receptor, TrkB, in neurons cultured from the cerebral cortex of 18-day-old embryonic rats were examined. BDNF mRNA was significantly increased from 24?48 hr after the TGF-?1 treatment over 20 ng/ml. Accumulation of BDNF protein in the culture medium was also potentiated by TGF-?1, although the intracellular content of BDNF was nearly unchanged. The enhancement of BDNF mRNA expression was suppressed by the co-presence of decorin, a small TGF-?-binding proteoglycan that inhibits the biological activities of TGF-?s. mRNA expression of full-length TrkB, the bioactive high-affinity receptor for BDNF, was also upregulated after treatment with TGF-?1. These observations suggest that: 1) TGF-?1 potentiates BDNF/TrkB autocrine or local paracrine system; and 2) the neurotrophic activity of TGF-?1 is partly responsible for the BDNF induced by TGF-?1 itself. To test this latter possibility, we examined the neuronal survival activity of TGF-?1 with or without K252a, a selective inhibitor of Trk family tyrosine kinases. TGF-?1 significantly enhanced neuronal survival, but the co-presence of K252a completely suppressed the activity, demonstrating the involvement of Trk receptor signaling in TGF-?1-mediated neuronal survival in cultured rat cortical neurons. These results seem to be in line with recent findings by other investigators that some neurotrophic factors including BDNF require TGF-?s as a cofactor to exert their neurotrophic activities. J.
