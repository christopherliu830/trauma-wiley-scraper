AB  - Recent advances in nanotechnology have generated wide interest in applying nanomaterials for neural prostheses. An ideal neural interface should create seamless integration into the nervous system and performs reliably for long periods of time. As a result, many nanoscale materials not originally developed for neural interfaces become attractive candidates to detect neural signals and stimulate neurons. In this comprehensive review, an overview of state-of-the-art microelectrode technologies provided first, with focus on the material properties of these microdevices. The advancements in electro?active nanomaterials are then reviewed, including conducting polymers, carbon nanotubes, graphene, silicon nanowires, and hybrid organic-inorganic nanomaterials, for neural recording, stimulation, and growth. Finally, technical and scientific challenges are discussed regarding biocompatibility, mechanical mismatch, and electrical properties faced by these nanomaterials for the development of long-lasting functional neural interfaces.

AB  - Summary This chapter outlines the steps for safe, effective in-office implant maintenance in the evidence-based protocol, and reviews the medical history. It also discusses how to assess/monitor the implant, and provides safe instrumentation and polishing. Implant maintenance around these single implants, mini implants, and attachments is extremely important. They support a removable overdenture and accumulate plaque and biofilm all day until the patient removes the overdenture at night. Understanding various implant designs and having the proper instruments for safe implant maintenance will provide the patients with the ideal implant care to ensure the long-term success of their implants. The next step in the peri-implant maintenance appointment is to polish. The goal for polishing implants is to gently remove bacterial plaque, interrupt the bacterial metabolism and effectively disrupt the biofilm. Proper in-office implant maintenance starts with appointments every 3 months for the first year to help prevent infection or failure of the implant.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aim Vascular calcification has played a vital role in increasing the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in maintenance haemodialysis (MHD) patients. This study is aimed at exploring the prognostic value of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) estimated by plain lateral abdominal radiography in MHD patients. Methods Lateral abdominal radiography was used to determine the abdominal aortic calcification score (AACS). The serum level of fibroblast growth factor-23 was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patients were divided into two groups: no or minor calcification group (AACS <?5) and moderate to severe calcification group (AACS ≥?5). All patients were followed up to death or the end of the study (30 November 2016). Results A total of 114 patients were enrolled in this study, including 64 males (56.1%), and the mean age was 57.42?±?13.48?years. Seventy-six patients (66.7%) exhibited AAC. Independent predictors for moderate to severe calcification were older age (odds ratio (OR) 1.06 (1.02?1.10), P = 0.003), longer dialysis vintage (OR 1.01 (1.00?1.02), P = 0.039), presence of smoking (OR 3.01 (1.18?7.70), P = 0.021) and higher Log fibroblast growth factor-23 serum levels (OR 2.83 (1.01?7.94), P = 0.048). During a median follow-up of 6.0 (5.6, 6.1) years, 22 patients (19.3%) died of all-cause death, and 17 cases (14.9%) died of CVD. Kaplan?Meier survival curves showed that patients in the moderate to severe calcification group had significantly higher all-cause (28.3 vs 11.5%, P = 0.028) and CVD mortality (22.6 vs 8.2%, P = 0.035) than that in the no or minor calcification group. A multivariate Cox regression showed that AACS (hazard ratio 1.08 (1.01?1.15), P = 0.022) was an independent predictor of CVD mortality. Compared with the no or minor calcification group, the risk of CVD mortality was increased by a factor of 3.14 in patients in the moderate to severe calcification group (hazard ratio 3.14 (1.04?9.44), P = 0.042). Conclusion Our data suggest that AAC is prevalent in MHD patients and could provide potential predictive information for CVD mortality. Plain lateral abdominal radiography, which is simple and cheap and involves lower radiation, might represent an appropriate screening method for evaluating vascular calcification in daily clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract Successful bone regeneration benefits from three-dimensional (3D) bioresorbable scaffolds that mimic the hierarchical architecture and mechanical characteristics of native tissue extracellular matrix (ECM). A scaffold platform that integrates unique material chemistry with nanotopography while mimicking the 3D hierarchical bone architecture and bone mechanics is reported. A biocompatible dipeptide polyphosphazene-polyester blend is electrospun to produce fibers in the diameter range of 50?500 nm to emulate dimensions of collagen fibrils present in the natural bone ECM. Various electrospinning and process parameters are optimized to produce blend nanofibers with good uniformity, appropriate mechanical strength, and suitable porosity. Biomimetic 3D scaffolds are created by orienting blend nanofiber matrices in a concentric manner with an open central cavity to replicate bone marrow cavity, as well as the lamellar structure of bone. This biomimicry results in scaffold stress?strain curve similar to that of native bone with a compressive modulus in the mid-range of values for human trabecular bone. Blend nanofiber matrices support adhesion and proliferation of osteoblasts and show an elevated phenotype expression compared to polyester nanofibers. Furthermore, the 3D structure encourages osteoblast infiltration and ECM secretion, bridging the gaps of scaffold concentric walls during in vitro culture. The results also highlight the importance of in situ ECM secretion by cells in maintaining scaffold mechanical properties following scaffold degradation with time. This study for the first time demonstrates the feasibility of developing a mechanically competent nanofiber matrix via a biomimetic strategy and the advantages of polyphosphazene blends in promoting osteoblast phenotype progression for bone regeneration.
