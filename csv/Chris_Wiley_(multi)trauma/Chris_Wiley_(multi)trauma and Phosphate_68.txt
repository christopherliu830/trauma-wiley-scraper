AB  - Abstract 1611 patients were included in this investigation. 16.7% of the patients were involved in traffic accidents, 38.2% were injured by a sudden fall, 3.5% were involved in an act of violence, 22.8% were injured by a sports related accident and 18.9% were hurt within a work-related accident. 19.5% of the patients tested positive for alcohol, 5.2% tested positive for benzodiazepines and 1.4% tested positive for both substances. Blood samples were positive for alcohol in 27% males and 7.7% females and for benzodiazepines in 6.3% males and in 3.5% females. The mean blood alcohol concentration (BAC) as well as the mean benzodiazepine plasma level were higher in patients injured in violent accidents compared to the other injury groups. This study provides epidemiologic information about the relationship between specific kinds of accidents and alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use in a large probability sample of emergency room patients. We found a high number of patients using alcohol, and a lower but still relavant number of benzodiazepine users in this large and unselected traumatology ER sample. This study adds evidence to the existing literature about the co-occurance of alcohol and/or benzodiazepine consumption and accident-related injuries. Copyright ? 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Homocysteine (HCY) has recently been linked to fragility fractures. Moreover, HCY activates osteoclasts. Little is known about the effect of HCY on activity of human osteoblasts (OBs). We hypothesized that HCY decreases the activity of OBs. Osteoblasts obtained from tra-becular human bone specimens of eight donors were cultured with conditioned medium. Culture medium was adjusted to 0, 100, 500, 1000 and 2000 ?M HCY. After 14 days alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity, pro-collagen type I N-terminal peptide (PINP) and osteocalcin (OC) secretion in the supernatant were measured. After 20 days the formation of mineralized matrix was analyzed. HCY-stimulated AP activity gradually (100 ?M HCY: 118%, P= 0.006; 500 ?M HCY: 125%, P < 0.001). At 1000 and 2000 ?M HCY the increase of AP activity was reversible (1000 ?M HCY: 106%, P= 0.317; 2000 ?M HCY: 102%, P < 0.737). The PINP secretion was also stimulated by HCY reaching a maximum of 260 ± 154 ?g/l at 500 ?mol/l versus 205 ± 94 ?,g/l in controls. After 20 days of culture the formation of bone matrix was increased at 100 and 500 ?M HCY. OC secretion was not significantly changed. The results of the present study consistently demonstrate a moderate stimulation of primary human OB activity by increasing concentrations of HCY. However, the magnitude of this effect seems to be less pronounced than recent observations on primary human osteoclasts, suggesting a dysbalance between OBs and osteoclasts in favour of osteoclasts

AB  - Complement fragment (C)5a is a 74 residue pro-inflammatory polypeptide produced during activation of the complement cascade of serum proteins in response to foreign surfaces such as microorganisms and tissue damaged by physical or chemical injury. C5a binds to at least two seven-transmembrane domain receptors, C5aR (C5R1, CD88) and C5L2 (gpr77), expressed ubiquitously on a wide variety of cells but particularly on the surface of immune cells like macrophages, neutrophils and T cells. C5aR is a classical G protein-coupled receptor that signals through Gαi and Gα16, whereas C5L2 does not appear to couple to G proteins and has no known signalling activity. Although C5a was first described as an anaphylatoxin and later as a leukocyte chemoattractant, the widespread expression of C5aR suggested more general functionality. Our understanding of the physiology of C5a has improved significantly in recent years through exploitation of receptor knockout and knockin mice, C5 and C5a antibodies, soluble recombinant C5a and C5a analogues and newly developed receptor antagonists. C5a is now also implicated in non-immunological functions associated with developmental biology, CNS development and neurodegeneration, tissue regeneration, and haematopoiesis. Combined receptor mutagenesis, molecular modelling, structure-activity relationship studies and species dependence for ligand potency on C5aR have been helpful for identifying ligand binding sites on the receptor and for defining mechanisms of receptor activation and inactivation. This review will highlight major developments in C5a receptor research that support C5aR as an important therapeutic target. The intriguing possibilities raised by the existence of a non-signalling C5a receptor are also discussed.

AB  - Summary? More than 85% of the global population requires repair or replacement of a craniofacial structure. These defects range from simple tooth decay to radical oncologic craniofacial resection. Regeneration of oral and craniofacial tissues presents a formidable challenge that requires synthesis of basic science, clinical science and engineering technology. Identification of appropriate scaffolds, cell sources and spatial and temporal signals (the tissue engineering triad) is necessary to optimize development of a single tissue, hybrid organ or interface. Furthermore, combining the understanding of the interactions between molecules of the extracellular matrix and attached cells with an understanding of the gene expression needed to induce differentiation and tissue growth will provide the design basis for translating basic science into rationally developed components of this tissue engineering triad. Dental tissue engineers are interested in regeneration of teeth, oral mucosa, salivary glands, bone and periodontium. Many of these oral structures are hybrid tissues. For example, engineering the periodontium requires growth of alveolar bone, cementum and the periodontal ligament. Recapitulation of biological development of hybrid tissues and interfaces presents a challenge that exceeds that of engineering just a single tissue. Advances made in dental interface engineering will allow these tissues to serve as model systems for engineering other tissues or organs of the body. This review will begin by covering basic tissue engineering principles and strategic design of functional biomaterials. We will then explore the impact of biomaterials design on the status of craniofacial tissue engineering and current challenges and opportunities in dental tissue engineering.

AB  - Summary Neuromuscular diseases have traditionally been overlooked, underdiagnosed and poorly treated when compared with neurological diseases with greater visibility, social impact, or which pose a threat for survival. This chapter provides a comprehensive summary of disorders of peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction, muscle and the anterior horn cell. Peripheral nerves are bundles of axons, Schwann cells, elaborated myelin and the supporting cellular tissues whose primary purpose is to communicate neural information between the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral sensory or effector structures. All peripheral nervous system (PNS) axons are ensheathed by Schwann cells and the Schwann cells are, in turn, invested by a continuous layer of basal lamina. Functional or structural abnormalities of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) interfere with the transmission of neural impulses from motor nerves to muscles. Myasthenic crisis indicates the development of ventilatory failure. The chapter also talks about congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), ermatomyositis, polymyositis, necrotising autoimmune myopathy (NAM) and rhabdomyolysis.

AB  - Summary Delirium, also commonly referred to as encephalopathy, is an alteration in a patient's level of consciousness, arousal, and alertness, typically manifesting with confusion and disorientation. Coma is a state of profound impairment in the level of arousal characterized by complete unresponsiveness. Delirium and coma are symptom complexes with diverse etiologies and degrees of severity, resulting from dysfunction of bilateral cerebral hemispheres or of the ascending reticular activating system (RAS). Etiologic categories considered include metabolic derangement, toxicity or withdrawal, systemic or CNS infection, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and supra- and infra-tentorial lesions causing coma. Both delirium and coma are potentially life-threatening situations and should be assessed and managed emergently. Critical diagnostic possibilities include profound hypo- or hyper-glycemia or other perilous but correctible metabolic derangements; cerebral hemorrhage or imminent herniation warranting neurosurgical intervention; meningitis or encephalitis warranting urgent antibiotics/antivirals; and alcohol withdrawal warranting prompt administration of appropriate benzodiazepines.
