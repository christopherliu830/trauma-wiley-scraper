AB  - Summary Neutrophil influx is essential for corneal regeneration (Gan et al. 1999). KM+, a lectin from Artocarpus integrifolia, induces neutrophil migration (Santos-de-Oliveira et al. 1994). This study aims at investigating a possible effect of KM+ on corneal regeneration in rabbits. A 6.0-mm diameter area of debridement was created on the cornea of both eyes by mechanical scraping. The experimental eyes received drops of KM+ (2.5??g/ml) every 2?h. The control eyes received buffer. The epithelial wounded areas of the lectin-treated and untreated eyes were stained with fluorescein, photographed and measured. The animals were killed 12?h (group 1, n?=?5), 24?h (group 2, n?=?10) and 48?h (group 3, n?=?5) after the scraping. The corneas were analysed histologically (haematoxylin and eosin and immunostaining for proliferation cell nuclear antigen, p63, vascular endothelial growth factor, c-Met and laminin). No significant differences were found at the epithelial gap between treated and control eyes in the group 1. However, the number of neutrophils in the wounded area was significantly higher in treated eyes in this group. Three control and seven treated eyes were healed completely and only rare neutrophils persisted in the corneal stroma in group 2. No morphological distinction was observed between treated and control eyes in group 3. In treated corneas of group 2, there was an increase in immunostaining of factors involved in corneal healing compared to controls. Thus, topical application of KM+ may facilitate corneal epithelial wound healing in rabbits by means of a mechanism that involves increased influx of neutrophils into the wounded area induced by the lectin.

AB  - Abstract Bone fragility and loss are a significant cause of morbidity in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and the lack of effective therapeutic options means that treatment is more often palliative rather than curative. A deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of CF-related bone disease (CFBD) is necessary to develop new therapies. Defective CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein and chronic inflammation in bone are important components of the CFBD development. The receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) drive the regulation of bone turnover. To investigate their roles in CFBD, we evaluated the involvement of defective CFTR in their production level in CF primary human osteoblasts with and without inflammatory stimulation, in the presence or not of pharmacological correctors of the CFTR. No major difference in cell ultrastructure was noted between cultured CF and non-CF osteoblasts, but a delayed bone matrix mineralization was observed in CF osteoblasts. Strikingly, resting CF osteoblasts exhibited strong production of RANKL protein, which was highly localized at the cell membrane and was enhanced in TNF (TNF-α) or IL-17-stimulated conditions. Under TNF stimulation, a defective response in OPG production was observed in CF osteoblasts in contrast to the elevated OPG production of non-CF osteoblasts, leading to an elevated RANKL-to-OPG protein ratio in CF osteoblasts. Pharmacological inhibition of CFTR chloride channel conductance in non-CF osteoblasts replicated both the decreased OPG production and the enhanced RANKL-to-OPG ratio. Interestingly, using CFTR correctors such as C18, we significantly reduced the production of RANKL by CF osteoblasts, in both resting and TNF-stimulated conditions. In conclusion, the overexpression of RANKL and high membranous RANKL localization in osteoblasts are related to defective CFTR, and may worsen bone resorption, leading to bone loss in patients with CF. Targeting osteoblasts with CFTR correctors may represent an effective strategy to treat CFBD. Copyright ? 2016 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background: ?Ureteric stents have been used in urological practice for over 25?years and in many cases have become almost routine. The purpose of the present review is to highlight the uses, complications and risk management issues associated with their use. Methods: ?An extensive literature review was conducted and knowledge from past experience was accessed to give a summary of past and current ureteric stent use in urology. Results: ?Broadly, there are stone and non-stone indications for stenting. Complications may range from the commonly experienced ?stent syndrome? to the medico-legal dilemma of the forgotten stent. Risk management must be applied to all uses of stenting to minimize complications and achieve best practice. Conclusion: ?Although almost routine in many areas of urological practice, the complications and implications for risk management of ureteric stenting cannot be ignored.

AB  - BACKGROUND Many transfusion services determine the titer of potentially incompatible plasma-containing products by performing a one-dilution titer at their selected titer threshold. This study compared the results of immediate spin (IS) one-dilution titers determined by three methods with a reference standard method. METHODS Plasma-containing products from group A and O donors were titered using the participant's routine IS one-dilution titer method. No time or temperature incubations were performed, and antihuman globulin reagent was not used. The samples were then tested using a reference method, which was a saline tube test with a 1-hour room temperature incubation; antihuman globulin was not used in the reference method. The results of the one-dilution titer were then compared to that obtained in the reference method. RESULTS Nine centers participated in this study. There were 698 antibodies from 374 units tested by the manual IS tube one-dilution titer method; sensitivity was 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83?0.92), and specificity was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.98?1.00). There were 412 antibodies from 206 units tested by the manual and automated IS buffered gel card one-dilution titer method; sensitivity was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91?0.98), and specificity was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.81?0.91). There were 98 antibodies from 49 units tested by an automated microplate IS one-dilution titer method; sensitivity was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71?0.93), and specificity was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.92?0.99). All three methods had an accuracy rate of 90% or greater. CONCLUSION The manual and automated one-dilution titer methods are suitable for screening plasma-containing units, although more evaluation of the automated microplate method might be required.
