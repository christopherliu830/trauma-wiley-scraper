AB  - Abstract Various bacterial components (e.g., endotoxin, teichoic and lipoteichoic acids, peptidoglycans, DNA) induce or enhance inflammation by stimulating the innate immune system and/or are directly toxic in eukariotic cells (e.g., hemolysins). When antibiotics which inhibit bacterial protein synthesis kill bacteria, smaller quantities of proinflammatory or toxic compounds are released in vitro and in vivo than during killing of bacteria by ?-lactams and other cell-wall active drugs. In general, high antibiotic concentrations liberate lower quantities of bacterial proinflammatory or toxic compounds than concentrations close to the minimum inhibitory concentration. In animal models of Escherichia coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus peritonitis/sepsis and of Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis, a lower release of proinflammatory bacterial compounds was associated with a reduced mortality or neuronal injury. Pre-treatment with a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor reduced the strong release of bacterial products usually observed during treatment with a ?-lactam antibiotic. Data available strongly encourage clinical trials comparing antibiotic regimens with different release of proinflammatory/toxic bacterial products. The benefit of the approach to reduce the liberation of bacterial products should be greatest in patients with a high bacterial load.

AB  - The number of new drugs for treating neurotrauma is rapidly expanding. Emerging theories regarding the mechanisms of secondary neuronal injury provide the scientific basis for evaluating these new agents. Some of the most promising mechanisms for intervention are ionotropic channel antagonism, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, and neurotrophic factor augmentation. Many of these new agents are undergoing clinical trials to establish their roles in therapy.

AB  - Tissue bioadhesives have raised interest in the last few decades as an alternative to sutures or staples in wound closing applications because of various advantages. They are less time consuming, less painful, and can be less expensive, without compromising the cosmetic outcome. Even though extensive efforts have been made, an ideal tissue adhesive has not been developed to date, mostly because of toxicity or weak bonding strength issues. Novel bioadhesives comprised gelatin and alginate with carbodiimide (N-ethyl-N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide [EDC]) as the cross-linking agent were recently developed by our research group. In the current research, N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) was added to the cross-linking reaction to enable a decrease in the EDC content and therefore also the cytotoxicity, without decreasing the bonding strength. The antibiotic drug clindamycin was added to the bioadhesive formulation. It was selected because of being inert toward the cross-linking reaction. The effects of EDC, NHS, and clindamycin concentrations on the ex vivo bonding strength, drug release profile, and fibroblast viability, as well as the microbial inhibition, were studied. Incorporation of clindamycin was found to improve the bonding strength of the adhesive. Its release profile was highly effective against the two relevant bacterial strains, Staphylococcus albus and Staphylococcus aureus, which were eradicated within less than 48?h. The good cytotoxicity results indicate that our new antibiotic-eluting bioadhesives represent an effective and selective treatment option for bacterial infections. Delivering an antibiotic drug locally using our bioadhesive could decrease the risk of infections and increase the therapeutic effect of the bioadhesive itself.

AB  - Metabolic heat produced by Thoroughbred racehorses during racing can rapidly elevate core body temperature (1°C/min). When environmental conditions are hot and humid, the normal physiological cooling mechanisms become ineffective. The heat accumulated may exceed a critical thermal maximum (estimated to be 42°C), which may trigger a complex pathophysiological cascade with potentially lethal consequences. This syndrome has been labelled exertional heat illness (EHI). EHI is described in humans, but has not been well documented in Thoroughbred racehorses. The clinical signs described in racehorses would suggest that the pathophysiological events affecting the central nervous (CNS) and gastrointestinal systems are similar to those described in humans. Clinical signs are progressive and include signs of endotoxaemia and increasing levels of CNS dysfunction. Initially, horses that may be mildly irritable (agitated, randomly kicking out) may progress to unmanageable (disorientation, severe ataxia, falling) and ultimately convulsions, coma and death. Currently, the approach to treatment is largely empirical and involves rapid and effective cooling, administration of drugs to provide sedation, administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to ameliorate the effects of endotoxaemia and glucocorticoids to stabilise cell membranes and reduce the effects of inflammation on the CNS. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge about EHI in Thoroughbred racehorses, suggests a likely pathophysiology of the syndrome in horses based on the current literature on heat illness in humans and horses, and outlines current treatment strategies being used to treat racehorses with clinical signs of EHI.

AB  - Summary The use of autografts, allografts, and synthetic materials in neurosurgery continues to increase. Bone grafts are frequently used for spinal fusion and dural grafts are often utilized in cranial tumor cases. Autografts have previously been the gold standard for such cases since they have excellent graft incorporation without the risk of rejection or disease transmission, however, their drawback is limited supply and potential donor site morbidity. Allografts are an acceptable alternative due to their relative abundance, availability of various sizes and shapes, handling characteristics, and elimination of procurement-related complications for the patient. Strict guidelines for allograft donor screening and advances in processing techniques have reduced the risk of disease transmission but some processing treatments can compromise graft mechanical strength. Nonetheless, allografts may still rarely elicit an inflammatory response, be rejected, or transmit disease. New synthetic materials are another option but they may not incorporate into host tissues as well as autografts or allografts. Neurosurgeons face the perpetual challenge of utilizing the appropriate graft to meet the specific needs of each patient
