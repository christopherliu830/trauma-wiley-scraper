AB  - With so many other social, economic and environmental factors at work establishing linear, causative relationships between anthropogenic climate change and population dynamics it has been difficult to pinpoint the specific human consequences of climate change on respective populations. Qualitative information was examined based on interviewees? testimonies and personal experience, as well as a descriptive analysis of population records, climate-change related impacts, and consequences of uneven development in the Republic of Kiribati and Tuvalu, two low-lying atoll nations in the Pacific region taken as examples to illustrate the issues involved. Strong evidence was found that recent influxes in population movements to urban central islands from rural outer islands experienced in these countries can be attributed to a combination of the adverse impacts of climate change and socioeconomic factors inherit in small island developing states. Moreover, internal migrants cannot be accommodated in their states of origin, putting pressure on local infrastructure and services. This, combined with a recent population boom, has led to a decline in human development indicators and a general livelihood decline.

AB  - Background: Dietary supplementation of L-arginine as a mechanism to enhance cellular immune response (T lymphocytes), has slowly gained approval, and appears especially important during critical illness. Despite its clinical use, little is known as to the direct effects of L-arginine on the different T lymphocyte subpopulations. Methods: Lymphocytes were harvested from spleens of C57 Bl/6 mice, and proliferation was induced with anti-CD3 in the presence of different concentrations of L-arginine ranging from 0 to 1000 ?mol/L. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the effect of L-arginine on T lymphocyte subpopulations. Interleukin-2 production was measured by ELISA and gene expression by RT-PCR. Results: L-Arginine at or greater than 100 ?mol/L significantly enhanced anti-CD3 stimulated T lymphocyte proliferation (p =.01). L-Arginine was essential for adequate T lymphocyte (CD3+) cellular maturation (p =.01). Proliferation of Helper T cells (CD4+) was not dependent on L-arginine. In contrast, Cytotoxic T cells (CD8+) showed a dose dependent proliferation in response to L-arginine (p =.01). Of the CD8+ cells, an increase in the CD45RA negative CD8 positive (memory) T cell subpopulation was observed with the addition of L-arginine. In addition, the number of cell surface CD8 receptors (CD8R) and CD3 receptors (CD3R) increased in the presence of L-arginine (p =.01, p =.04). Interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) expression was not up-regulated by L-arginine. L-Arginine modestly increased IL-2 production and had pronounced effects on its disappearance from the culture media (p <.0001). Interleukin-2 mRNA expression was not dependent on L-arginine. Conclusions: The requirements for L-arginine for the proliferation of CD3 stimulated T lymphocytes vary widely, and have to be taken into account when studying the mechanism of how L-arginine enhances cellular proliferation. L-Arginine may increase cellular proliferation by increasing specific receptor expression and the utilization of interleukin-2. (Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 25:23?29, 2001)

AB  - Background The outcome of severe acute pancreatitis has scarcely improved in 10 years. Further impact will require new paradigms in pathophysiology and treatment. There is accumulating evidence to support the concept that the intestine has a key role in the pathophysiology of severe acute pancreatitis which goes beyond the notion of secondary pancreatic infection. Intestinal ischaemia and reperfusion and barrier failure are implicated in the development of multiple organ failure. Discussion Conventional management of severe acute pancreatitis has tended to ignore the intestine. More recent attempts to rectify this problem have included 1) resuscitation aimed at restoring intestinal blood flow through the use of appropriate fluids and splanchnic-sparing vasoconstrictors or inotropes; 2) enteral nutrition to help maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier; 3) selective gut decontamination and prophylactic antibiotics to reduce bacterial translocation and secondary infection. Novel therapies are being developed to limit intestinal injury, and these include antioxidants and anti-cytokine agents. This paper focuses on the role of the intestine in the pathogenesis of severe acute pancreatitis and reviews the implications for management.

AB  - ABSTRACT Low frequency pulsed electromagnetic field (LFPEMF) has been shown to provide anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects. However, there are no reports on whether LFPEMF can treat spinal cord injury (SCI) and its therapeutic mechanism. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate whether LFPEMF can promote the recovery of neurological function after SCI in rats and its therapeutic mechanism. Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) score and transcranial magnetic motor-evoked potentials (tcMMEPs) were recorded to assess the recovery of neurological function. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and luxol fast blue (LFB) staining were performed to assess the severity of SCI. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining and western blotting (WB) were performed to assess the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) into oligodendrocytes (OLs). Toluidine blue (TB) staining was performed to assess remyelination. WB and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were performed to assess the expression of neurotrophins and inflammatory factors. Our results showed that following stimulation by LFPEMF, there were significant improvements in BBB scores, tcMMEP amplitudes, the extent of the damage, and reduced demyelination in rats after SCI. The mature OLs, the number of well-myelinated fibers, and the myelin sheath thickness significantly increased in rats stimulated by LFPEMF after SCI. The expression of neurotrophins significantly increased, and the expression of inflammatory factors significantly decreased in rats stimulated by LFPEMF after SCI. Therefore, we suggest that LFPEMF can promote the recovery of neurological function in rats after SCI by improving the differentiation of OPCs into OLs and promoting remyelination, as well as by inhibiting inflammation and promoting neurotrophic effects. ? 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - ABSTRACT Rotator cuff degeneration is one of the factors contributing to rotator cuff tears. Oxidative stress is involved in tendon degeneration, and superoxide-induced oxidative stress plays a pathological role in regulating the balance between oxidation and reduction. The role of oxidative stress in rotator cuff tears, however, is unclear. This study, therefore, aimed to investigate the contribution of superoxide-induced oxidative stress to rotator cuff tears. Seventy patients were recruited and divided into two groups: patients with (Ruptured group) and those without (Unruptured group) a rotator cuff tear. Specimens from both groups were collected during surgery. Degeneration morphology was classified according to the degeneration score. Superoxide-induced oxidative stress was assessed according to dihydroethidium (DHE) relative fluorescence intensity, capacity for antioxidation according to superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and the balance between oxidation and reduction based on the redox ratio. Data were compared between groups. Correlations between the degeneration score and the oxidative stress factors were calculated. Degeneration score and DHE relative fluorescence intensity were significantly higher in the Ruptured than the Unruptured group. The SOD activity was not significantly different between groups. Degeneration score was positively correlated with both DHE relative fluorescence intensity and SOD activity. Thus, superoxide-induced oxidative stress and tendon degeneration were greater in rotator cuff tear tissues than in those with no tear, suggesting that oxidative imbalance may be involved in degenerative rotator cuff tears. Clinical Relevance: Understanding the mechanisms of superoxide-induced oxidative stress may lead to targeted tissue therapy for degenerative rotator cuff tears. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Objective We retrospectively studied the efficacy of personalized therapy with surgical resection plus prophylactic management of postsurgical auricular keloids by intralesional injection of betamethasone and local pressure therapy using magnets in patients with auricular keloids. Methods Surgical excision was performed in all patients, and surgical techniques including fusiform excision of the keloid scar, core excision of the keloid scar followed by flap repair, and scar graft were chosen. Results A total of 85 patients with 98 auricular keloids were eligible. Seventy-two (74%) patients had primary auricular keloids, and 13 patients had recurrent keloids after surgical excision. Keloids, were located in the helix in 28 (32.9%) cases, in the earlobe in 45 (52.9%) cases, and in the entire auricle in 12 (14.1%) cases. The size of auricular keloids ranged from 10 to 35 mm. Surgical resection was uneventful in all cases. Twenty-one (21.4%) patients received fusiform excision, 47 (47.9%) patients underwent core excision and flap repair, and 30 (30.6%) patients received skin grafts. The patients were followed up for median duration of 1 year (range: 12?24 months). The cure rate was 87.2%, and the recurrence rate was 12.8%. Conclusion A personalized surgical approach based on the characteristics of auricular keloids in each patient and a multimodal therapeutic regimen including surgical excision, glucocorticoid blockade, and intralesional injection of glucocorticoids and pressure therapy improve the cure rate and reduce the recurrence rate of auricular keloids.
