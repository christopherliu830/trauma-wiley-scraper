AB  - Abstract Objective We retrospectively studied the efficacy of personalized therapy with surgical resection plus prophylactic management of postsurgical auricular keloids by intralesional injection of betamethasone and local pressure therapy using magnets in patients with auricular keloids. Methods Surgical excision was performed in all patients, and surgical techniques including fusiform excision of the keloid scar, core excision of the keloid scar followed by flap repair, and scar graft were chosen. Results A total of 85 patients with 98 auricular keloids were eligible. Seventy-two (74%) patients had primary auricular keloids, and 13 patients had recurrent keloids after surgical excision. Keloids, were located in the helix in 28 (32.9%) cases, in the earlobe in 45 (52.9%) cases, and in the entire auricle in 12 (14.1%) cases. The size of auricular keloids ranged from 10 to 35 mm. Surgical resection was uneventful in all cases. Twenty-one (21.4%) patients received fusiform excision, 47 (47.9%) patients underwent core excision and flap repair, and 30 (30.6%) patients received skin grafts. The patients were followed up for median duration of 1 year (range: 12?24 months). The cure rate was 87.2%, and the recurrence rate was 12.8%. Conclusion A personalized surgical approach based on the characteristics of auricular keloids in each patient and a multimodal therapeutic regimen including surgical excision, glucocorticoid blockade, and intralesional injection of glucocorticoids and pressure therapy improve the cure rate and reduce the recurrence rate of auricular keloids.

AB  - Summary Most biomaterial-associated infections are caused by opportunistic pathogens and bacteria that are regularly found within the microflora of the implant site. In addition, a biomaterial implant or device remains at risk of infection by hematogenous spread of bacteria disseminated from infections elsewhere in the body or from infected peri-implant tissue in revision surgery. The resulting infections are frequently accompanied by patient morbidity and discomfort and can lead to surgical replacement of the implant after lengthy, unsuccessful attempts to mitigate infections with antibiotic treatments. Therefore, extensive study is aiming to find new infection-resistant antimicrobial biomaterials and coatings for implants and devices to effectively reduce the incidence of biomaterial-associated infections. An overview of the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial efficacies of the numerous biomaterials currently available is beyond the scope of this review. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of bioactive glasses as biomaterial delivery systems for antimicrobial agents.

AB  - Abstract Many photoreceptor degenerations initially affect rods, secondarily leading to cone death. It has long been assumed that the surviving neural retina is largely resistant to this sensory deafferentation. New evidence from fast retinal degenerations reveals that subtle plasticities in neuronal form and connectivity emerge early in disease. By screening mature natural, transgenic, and knockout retinal degeneration models with computational molecular phenotyping, we have found an extended late phase of negative remodeling that radically changes retinal structure. Three major transformations emerge: 1) Müller cell hypertrophy and elaboration of a distal glial seal between retina and the choroid/retinal pigmented epithelium; 2) apparent neuronal migration along glial surfaces to ectopic sites; and 3) rewiring through evolution of complex neurite fascicles, new synaptic foci in the remnant inner nuclear layer, and new connections throughout the retina. Although some neurons die, survivors express molecular signatures characteristic of normal bipolar, amacrine, and ganglion cells. Remodeling in human and rodent retinas is independent of the initial molecular targets of retinal degenerations, including defects in the retinal pigmented epithelium, rhodopsin, or downstream phototransduction elements. Although remodeling may constrain therapeutic intervals for molecular, cellular, or bionic rescue, it suggests that the neural retina may be more plastic than previously believed. J. Comp.

AB  - Summary Urinary stones are an ailment that can leave the patients asymptomatic or lead to significant morbidity or even mortality. Understanding the basic concepts of stone formation is vital in its prevention, which is key not only as a preventative measure but also to ensure patients do not form further stones. In this chapter, we discuss the pathophysiology of stone formation as well as the diagnostic and management modalities.

AB  - Abstract Cat spinal α-motoneurons were studied in the light and electron microscope after intracellular recording and staining with the fluorescent dye Procion Yellow. Generally, the ultrastructural preservation of the stained neurons improved when the amount of dye delivered was decreased, and when the duration of the microelectrode impalement of the neuron as well as the time between the intracellular staining and the tissue fixation was kept as short as possible. Utilizing the optimal experimental procedure finally arrived at, about one-third of the stained neurons could be used for further quantitative morphometric analysis. With respect to synaptology and gross architecture these cells appeared to differ from control motoneurons mainly with regard to a focal disarrangement of the cell body periphery, probably a result of the microelectrode injury, and a certain degree of damage to some large boutons.

AB  - Abstract Aim The objective of the present review was to answer the focused question: what is the effect of cell therapy in terms of orofacial bone regeneration compared to grafting with only biomaterial scaffolds and/or autogenous bone? Methods Electronic databases were searched for relevant controlled clinical and pre-clinical (large-animal) studies. Separate meta-analyses of quantitative data regarding histological or radiographic new bone formation were performed. Results Forty-seven eligible clinical and 57 pre-clinical studies were included. Clinical studies were categorized based on the use of ?minimally manipulated? whole tissues (e.g., bone marrow) or ex vivo expanded cells from ?uncommitted? (bone marrow, adipose tissue) or ?committed? sources (periosteum, bone). Based on limited and heterogeneous clinical evidence, implantation of cells (mostly whole bone marrow), in combination with biomaterial scaffolds results in bone regeneration which is (a) superior compared to implantation of scaffolds alone in sinus and horizontal ridge augmentation, and (b) comparable to autogenous bone in alveolar cleft repair. Conclusions Although current evidence points to the benefits of cell therapy in certain clinical indications, it is unclear whether the use of ex vivo expanded cells, either uncommitted or committed, is superior to whole tissue fractions in terms of bone regeneration. The relatively larger effect sizes in favour of cell therapy observed in pre-clinical studies are diminished in clinical trials. Future controlled studies should include cost-effectiveness analyses to guide clinical decision-making.

AB  - Summary When considering rabbit disease, it is important to know the age of the animal and the typical life cycle, be it commercial or pet. Healthy rabbits are fastidious in their habits and groom their pelage frequently, thus a poor quality, staring hair coat is a sign of poor health. Interestingly, rabbits with orodental disease have a 63 times greater risk of subsequently developing dermatologic disease. Skin biopsies, skin scrapings, microbiologic culture and sensitivity, and circulating steroid hormone and thyroxin levels may be evaluated to differentiate noninfectious from infectious causes of hair loss. Neurologic or apparent neurologic presenting signs are common in pet rabbits. As with musculoskeletal disorders, it is important to differentiate primary neurologic disease from other disorders that may produce neurologic signs. A thorough post-mortem examination of all systems is necessary to definitively characterize the cause of clinical signs suggestive of musculoskeletal disease.

AB  - Summary Gap junctions provide pathways for direct communication between cells in almost all animal tissues. The junctional channels are freely permeable to small ions and molecules but not to macromolecules. A coupled cell population is as a consequence a partial syncytium, within which metabolites, cofactors, small control molecules and inorganic ions can all diffuse freely through the combined cytoplasmic compartment, while intracellular macromolecules remain relatively fixed in space, in the cells where they are synthesized. Little is known about the extent and distribution of these communication compartments in tissues. To further understand their significance, we have mapped the patterns of junctional communication in skin by intracellular injection of the tracer dye Lucifer Yellow. Cells in the dermal layer are widely coupled, with dye spreading through hundreds of cells in a few minutes. Dye spread in the epidermis is much more restricted, passing in the same time into only a few cells. Dermal-epidermal coupling is not normally detected but is occasionally seen in new-born mouse skin when hair follicles are starting to invaginate. Dermal cells are coupled to a band of follicular cells near the base of mature hair follicles, whereas sebaceous glands appear to be coupled units, isolated from surrounding cells.
