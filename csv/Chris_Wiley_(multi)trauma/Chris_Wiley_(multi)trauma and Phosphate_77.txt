AB  - ABSTRACT Platelet-rich plasma (PRP), the plasma portion of blood with a high platelet concentration, has been reported to be helpful in stem cell chondrogenesis due to large amount of growth factors it contains. Here, we examined the influence of PRP on the differentiation of synovium-derived stem cells (SDSCs) and also evaluated if PRP alone was sufficient to induce SDSCs differentiation. First, the cell proliferation in various differentiation media was analyzed using the MTT assay and it was significantly higher in groups cultured with media that contained PRP. Then, We performed Safranin-O staining and type I, II, and X collagen immunohistochemistry (chondrogenesis), von Kossa staining (osteogenesis), and Oil Red O staining (adipogenesis). The staining was most prominent in groups cultured with optimized differentiation media without PRP in all three lineages of differentiation. The mRNA expression levels of typical differentiation markers were also analyzed using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Although, culture in optimized differentiation media increased the mRNA expression of the typical differentiation marker genes, they were significantly reduced when cultured in the media supplemented with PRP. PRP has negative effects on SDSC differentiation in all three differentiation lineages and PRP alone does not induce SDSC differentiation. ? 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract The presence of skeletal anomalies in farmed teleost fish is currently a major problem in aquaculture, entailing economical, biological and ethical issues. The common occurrence of skeletal abnormalities in farmed fish and the absence of effective solutions for avoiding their onset or definitely culling out the affected individuals as early as possible from the productive cycle, highlight the need to improve our knowledge on the basic processes regulating fish skeletogenesis and skeletal tissues differentiation, modelling and remodelling. Severe skeletal anomalies may actually occur throughout the entire life cycle of fish, but their development often begins with slight aberrations of the internal elements. Comprehensive investigation efforts conducted on reared larvae and juveniles could provide a great contribution in filling the gap in knowledge, as skeletogenesis and skeletal tissue differentiation occur during these early life stages. The aim of this review is to provide a synthetic but comprehensive picture of the actual knowledge on the ontogeny, typologies and occurrence of skeletal anomalies, and on the proposed causative factors for their onset in larvae and juveniles of European farmed fish. The state-of-art of knowledge of these issues is analysed critically intending to individualize the main gaps of knowledge that require to be filled, in order to optimize the morphological quality of farmed juveniles.

AB  - Abstract Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a family of linear polyesters consisting of 3,4, 5 and 6-hydroxyacids, synthesized by a variety of bacterial species. PHAs are divided into two groups based on the number of carbon atoms in their monomer units; short-chain-length (scl) PHAs and medium-chain-length (mcl) PHAs. Biodegradability is an essential material property required for tissue engineering and drug delivery applications. Various methods of manufacture can be used to alter the biodegradability of PHA devices such as by blending with others polymers, increasing the porosity and increasing the exposed surface area. PHAs have also been demonstrated to be suitable for use as scaffolds in tissue engineering since they are easily degradable and favor proliferation and attachment of cells. In the field of skin tissue engineering research, various skin components, cytokines, growth factors, and transcription factors have been used experimentally. Melanocytes have been seeded on various polymer scaffolds, as well as sweat and sebaceous glands.

AB  - Abstract Microchips for analytical purposes have attracted great attention over the last 20?years. In the present review, we focus on the most recent development of microchips for electrophoretic separation of proteins. This review starts with a short recalling about the microchips covering the basic microchip layout for CE and the commercial chips and microchip platforms. A short paragraph is dedicated to the surface treatment of microchips, which is of paramount importance in protein analysis. One section is dedicated to on-line sample pretreatment in microchips and summarizes different strategies to pre-concentrate or to purify proteins from complex matrixes. Most of the common modes used for CE of proteins have already been adapted to the chip format, while multidimensional approaches are still in progress. The different routes to achieve detection in microchip are also presented with a special attention to derivatization or labeling of proteins. Finally, several recent applications are mentioned. They highlight the great potential of electrophoretic separations of proteins in numerous fields such as biological, pharmaceutical or agricultural and food analysis. A bibliography with 151 references is provided covering papers published from 2000 to the early 2007.

AB  - Abstract The scientific knowledge base that supports clinical decisions about perioperative fluid management continues to evolve. However, despite these advancements in the understanding of the physiology of fluid replacement, the definition of ??optimal?? perioperative fluid management remains a matter of clinical judgment. With an appreciation of the many factors, both sensible and insensible, that contribute to changes in blood and extracellular fluid volume during surgery, clinicians have tried to create reproducible and generally applicable formulas for replacement of fluid during surgery. These formulas have been challenged recently by the introduction of new tools for monitoring cardiopulmonary function, by the implementation of monitor-guided protocols for fluid management, and, more recently, by clinical data suggesting that fluid restriction may improve surgical outcomes in some clinical settings. The relative ease of pre-identified fluid replacement protocols is being slowly replaced by data-guided interventions that take into account a variety of factors. Clinicians are therefore required to tailor their fluid replacement strategies based on preoperative patient characteristics, the type of surgery and even the type of anesthetic that is utilized. Some of the benefits of this new approach range from relatively ??minor?? outcomes such as diminished nausea after surgery to preventing postoperative complications such as wound breakdown and cardiopulmonary failure.

AB  - 1 Antagonists acting at the polyamine site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor, including a number of heterocyclic aminoalcohols related to ifenprodil, were investigated to establish their functional interaction at the NMDA receptor and their neuroprotective profile. 2 In murine cultured neocortical neurones, NMDA (100?m)-stimulated production of guanosine 3?:5?-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic GMP) was blocked by N-l([thienyl]-cyclohexyl)-piperidine (1 ?m) and by the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine (100 ?m). Ifenprodil and structurally related heterocyclic aminoalcohols inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the NMDAstimulated, NO-dependent production of cyclic GMP; rank potency order was: ifenprodil > 2309 BT > tibalosine > threo-tibalosine > 840S. 3 All of the polyamine NMDA antagonists blocked NMDA (300 ?m)-stimulated increases in intracellular calcium concentrations as measured by changes in the fluorescence of pre-loaded fluo-3-acetoxy methyl ester. Rank potency order was: ifenprodil > 2309 BT > 840S > tibalosine > threotibalosine. 4 In a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the polyamine NMDA antagonists as blockers of NMDA-induced cytotoxicity, all of the drugs were found to inhibit the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase after the exposure of the murine neocortical cultures to NMDA (100 ?m, 5 h). Rank potency order was: 2309 BT > ifenprodil > tibalosine > threo-tibalosine > 840S. 5 These results provide direct evidence that polyamine NMDA antagonists produce a functional blockade of the NMDA receptor complex. The heterocyclic aminoalcohols described herein, like ifenprodil, block NMDA-mediated elevation of intracellular NO and calcium, two key events in the excitotoxic cascade, and are cytoprotective.

AB  - Pancreatitis is a gastrointestinal disease with a worldwide sharp surge during the past decade. Pancreatitis includes acute and chronic subtypes, which are graded based on the amount of pancreatic inflammation. Phytoconstituents represent a promising class of therapeutic agents with wide acceptability not only based on folk practices but sound presence of pharmacological and molecular evidences. Growing research evidence indicates that different molecular mechanisms are involved in their protective effect. Many phytoremedies have been tried for the treatment of pancreatic injuries and have shown success in preclinical animal models of pancreatitis. The literature was largely collected through PubMed and Google scholar database. A large proportion of phytochemicals targets the inflammatory cascade and modulates the overtly acting redox balance among which nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells is the key molecule. Inhibition of apoptosis (artemisinin, embelin), inflammasome (withaferin A), neutrophil rolling (fucoidan), Ca+2 release (caffeine), mitogen activated protein kinase (guggulsterone) and many other novel mechanisms apart from antioxidant effect have been postulated behind the protective effect of phytoconstituents. The present review deals to fill the gap of hitherto unavailable comprehensive review on various plant products screened for the treatment of pancreatitis. The possible mechanistic profile of these phytochemicals is summarized. Copyright ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The identification and characterisation of cellular metabolites has now become an important strategy to obtain insight into functional plant biology. However, the extraction of metabolites for identification and analysis is challenging and, at the present time, usually requires destruction of the plant. Objective To detect different plant metabolites in living plants with no pre-treatment using the combination of iontophoresis and ion-chromatography with mass spectrometry detection. Methodology In this work, the simple and non-destructive method of reverse iontophoresis has been used to extract in situ multiple plant metabolites from intact Ocimum basilicum leaves. Subsequently, the analysis of these metabolites has been performed with ion chromatography coupled directly to high resolution mass spectrometric detection (IC-MS). Results The application of reverse iontophoresis to living plant samples has avoided the need for complex pre-treatments. With this approach, no less than 24 compounds, including organic acids and sugars as well as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were successfully detected. Conclusion The research demonstrates that it is feasible to monitor, therefore, a number of important plant metabolites using a simple, relatively fast and non-destructive approach.
