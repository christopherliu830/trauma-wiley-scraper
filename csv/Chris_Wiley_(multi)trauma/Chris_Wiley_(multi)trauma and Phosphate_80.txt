AB  - Despite the inherent ability of bone to regenerate itself, there are a number of clinical situations in which complete bone regeneration fails to occur. In view of shortcomings of conventional treatment, gene therapy may have a place in cases of critical-size bone loss that cannot be properly treated with current medical or surgical treatment. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of gene therapy in general, nonviral techniques of gene transfer including physical and chemical methods, RNA-based therapy, therapeutic genes to be transferred for bone regeneration, route of application including ex vivo application, and direct gene therapy approaches to regenerate bone. ?2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary A leg ulcer is a symptom and the treating physician needs to find out its origin by differential diagnostic approaches and procedures. The correct diagnosis leads to a specific therapy that ideally accelerates the healing of the ulceration. Identifying the pathogenesis of a leg ulcer is the first and main step towards healing. Although vascular diseases are the major causes of leg ulcers, one needs to consider, in addition to venous and arterial disorders, autoimmune, infectious, metabolic and neoplastic causes. The simple truth that one can only make a diagnosis that was considered holds particularly true in leg ulcers. The differential diagnostic considerations presented here appear in the daily routine of a dermatologist and the article provides help in diagnostic approaches and therapeutic decisions.

AB  - Abstract Background Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) causes motor and sensory defects, has strong impact on life quality and still has no effective therapy. Miconazole is one of the most widely used antifungal drugs; the aims of the study were to investigate the effects of miconazole during sciatic nerve regeneration in a mouse model of sciatic nerve crush injury. Methods We established peripheral nerve crush model and investigated the effects of miconazole by multiple aspects. We further studied the potential mechanism of action of miconazole by Western blotting, fluorescence immunohistochemistry, and PCR analysis. Results Miconazole improves the symptoms of crushed nerve by improving inflammatory cell infiltration and demyelinating myelin of sciatic nerve. Affected by miconazole, the proportion of inflammatory M1 macrophages in the distal part of the sciatic nerve was reduced, and the proportion of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages was increased. Finally, the neuroprotective properties of miconazole may be regulated by the nuclear factor (NF)-?B pathway. Conclusions Our data suggest that miconazole can effectively alleviate PNI, and the mechanism involves mediating a phenotype change of M1/ M2 macrophages. Thus, miconazole may represent a potential therapeutic intervention for nerve crush injury.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from post-natal tissues offer a suitable source of MSCs for cellular therapy. Limitation of the use of MSCs for therapeutic purposes is attributed to the onset of senescence and slowing down of proliferation upon repeated passaging. Dhanwantram kashaya (DK), a synthetic herbal formulation, is widely used in Ayurvedic medicine as a growth stimulant in children and for nerve regeneration. In this study, we evaluated the effects of DK on the proliferation, viability and senescence of human Wharton jelly MSCs (WJMSCs) in vitro. Results Using the MTT proliferation assay and live/dead trypan blue analysis, we found that DK increased proliferation of WJMSCS up to three folds when supplemented in the culture media. The BrdU cell proliferation assay showed a substantial increase in WJMSCs treated with DK. Notably, the ?-galactosidase senescence assay revealed that drug treated WJMSCs at late passage still had intact and viable WJMSCs whereas the untreated cells exhibited profound senescence. Conclusion These studies indicate that DK enhances the quality of WJMSCs by not only increasing the proliferation rate and decreasing their turnover time but also by delaying senescence. We have, thus, identified for the first time that a traditional Ayurvedic formulation, Dhanwantram kashaya, used as a growth enhancer, is able to improve the yield and quality of stem cells in vitro and could be an effective non-toxic supplement for culturing WJMSCs for clinical applications.

AB  - Abstract In this Editor's Review, articles published in 2015 are organized by category and briefly summarized. We aim to provide a brief reflection of the currently available worldwide knowledge that is intended to advance and better human life while providing insight for continued application of technologies and methods of organ Replacement, Recovery, and Regeneration. As the official journal of The International Federation for Artificial Organs, The International Faculty for Artificial Organs, the International Society for Rotary Blood Pumps, the International Society for Pediatric Mechanical Cardiopulmonary Support, and the Vienna International Workshop on Functional Electrical Stimulation, Artificial Organs continues in the original mission of its founders ?to foster communications in the field of artificial organs on an international level.? Artificial Organs continues to publish developments and clinical applications of artificial organ technologies in this broad and expanding field of organ Replacement, Recovery, and Regeneration from all over the world. We take this time also to express our gratitude to our authors for providing their work to this journal. We offer our very special thanks to our reviewers who give so generously of their time and expertise to review, critique, and especially provide meaningful suggestions to the author's work whether eventually accepted or rejected. Without these excellent and dedicated reviewers, the quality expected from such a journal could not be possible. We also express our special thanks to our Publisher, John Wiley & Sons for their expert attention and support in the production and marketing of Artificial Organs. We look forward to reporting further advances in the coming years.

AB  - The effects of total hepatectomy in a porcine model were studied. A portacaval shunt was constructed prior to hepatectomy, and the excised segment of inferior vena cava was replaced with a Dacron graft as soon as the liver had been removed. While the vena cava was clamped, venous return from the lower body to the heart was maintained using an extracorporeal veno-venous bypass system. The results of the study revealed that surprisingly few haemodynamic, biochemical or coagulation disturbances occur within the first 5 h following total hepatectomy in the pig, an animal with remarkably close anatomical and physiological similarities to man. In the anhepatic period which follows total hepatectomy during clinical liver transplantation, the situation is more complex, because pre-existing liver disease and portal hypertension, as well as major blood loss, often provide other reasons for metabolic and haemodynamic instability and coagulation disorders. The possible relevance of the findings in this large animal model to events that occur following total hepatectomy in the clinical situation is discussed.
