AB  - Purpose To quantify spatial and temporal inflammation-induced changes in vascular permeability and macrophage infiltration in guinea-pig (GP) cochlea using MRI. Materials and Methods GPs were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce cochlear inflammation. One group was injected with a gadolinium based contrast agent (GBCA) and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI was performed at 4, 7, and 10 days after LPS treatment. A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model was used to determine the apparent rate constant of GBCA extravasation (Ktrans). A second group was injected with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (USPIOs) and studied at 2, 3, and 7 days after LPS treatment to detect tissue USPIO uptake and correlate with histology. For both groups, control GPs were scanned similarly. Results The signal enhancement increased substantially and more rapidly at day 4 in LPS-treated than in control cochlea shortly following GBCA injection. Ktrans of LPS-treated cochlea was maximum on day 4 at 0.0218?±?0.0032 min?1 and then decreased to control level at 0.0036?±?0.0004 min?1 by day 10. In the second group, the relative signal intensity and T2 in cochlear perilymphatic spaces on day 2 decreased, on average, by 54% and 45%, respectively, compared with baseline and then remained under control levels by day 7. This suggests the infiltration of inflammatory cells, although unconfirmed by histology. Conclusion This provides the first measurement of cochlear vascular permeability using MRI and a quantitative evaluation of the development of cochlear inflammation. MRI holds considerable potential for the assessment of disease processes such as clinical diagnosis of conditions such as labyrinthitis. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Abstract During the 12th and 13th centuries thousands of people moved from Europe to the Middle East to fight, undertake pilgrimage, or settle and make a new life. The aim of this research is to investigate two populations from the Crusader kingdom of Jerusalem, by determining who was born in Europe and who came from the Middle East. Oxygen and strontium stable isotope analyses were conducted on the enamel of teeth from skeletal remains excavated from Crusader contexts. Twenty individuals from the coastal city of Caesarea (10 high status and 10 low status), and two local Near Eastern Christian farmers from the village of Parvum Gerinum (Tel Jezreel) were analyzed as a control sample. Results were compared with known geographic values for oxygen and strontium isotopes. The population of the city of Caesarea appears to have been dominated by European-born individuals (probably 19/20, but at least 13/20), with few locals. This was surprising as a much higher proportion of locals were expected. Both controls from the farming village of Parvum Gerinum had spent their childhood in the area of the village, which matches our understanding of limited mobility among poor Medieval farmers. This is the first time that stable isotope analysis has been applied to the study of the migration of peoples between Medieval Europe and the Middle East at the time of the crusades. In view of these findings, we must now rethink past estimations of population social structure in Levantine coastal Medieval cities during the Crusader period.

AB  - The effects of total hepatectomy in a porcine model were studied. A portacaval shunt was constructed prior to hepatectomy, and the excised segment of inferior vena cava was replaced with a Dacron graft as soon as the liver had been removed. While the vena cava was clamped, venous return from the lower body to the heart was maintained using an extracorporeal veno-venous bypass system. The results of the study revealed that surprisingly few haemodynamic, biochemical or coagulation disturbances occur within the first 5 h following total hepatectomy in the pig, an animal with remarkably close anatomical and physiological similarities to man. In the anhepatic period which follows total hepatectomy during clinical liver transplantation, the situation is more complex, because pre-existing liver disease and portal hypertension, as well as major blood loss, often provide other reasons for metabolic and haemodynamic instability and coagulation disorders. The possible relevance of the findings in this large animal model to events that occur following total hepatectomy in the clinical situation is discussed.

AB  - Abstract Here we report the first mediated pain free microneedle-based biosensor array for the continuous and simultaneous monitoring of lactate and glucose in artificial interstitial fluid (ISF). The gold surface of the microneedles has been modified by electrodeposition of Au-multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and successively by electropolymerization of the redox mediator, methylene blue (MB). Functionalization of the Au-MWCNTs/polyMB platform with the lactate oxidase (LOX) enzyme (working electrode 1) and with the FAD-Glucose dehydrogenase (FADGDH) enzyme (working electrode 2) enabled the continuous monitoring of lactate and glucose in the artificial ISF. The lactate biosensor exhibited a high sensitivity (797.4±38.1??A?cm?2?mM?1), a good linear range (10?100??M) with a detection limit of 3??M. The performance of the glucose biosensor were also good with a sensitivity of 405.2±24.1??A?cm?2?mM?1, a linear range between 0.05 and 5?mM and a detection limit of 7??M. The biosensor array was tested to detect the amount of lactate generated after 100?minutes of cycling exercise (12?mM) and of glucose after a normal meal for a healthy patient (10?mM). The results reveal that the new microneedles-based biosensor array seems to be a promising tool for the development of real-time wearable devices with a variety of sport medicine and clinical care applications.

AB  - Abstract Native hemoglobin in the form of stroma-free hemoglobin cannot be used as blood substitute. Hemoglobin has to be modified either molecularly or encapsulated. First generation molecularly modified ultrapure hemoglobins are now in clinical trial - some in Phase III. There are a number of these. Polyhemoglo- bin is formed by crosslinking hemoglobin molecules intermolecularly and intra- molecularly. A crosslinked single hemoglobin molecule is formed by crosslinking hemoglobin intramolecularly. Recombinant hemoglobin from E.coli is formed by fusion of the subunits of each hemoglobin molecule. Conjugated hemoglobin is formed by crosslinking each hemoglobin molecule to soluble polymers. A second generation system formed by crosslinking hemoglobin- superoxide dismutase-catalase is being developed. A third generation hemoglobin-based blood substitute is based on microencapsulated hemoglobin, artificial red blood cells, that more closely resemble a complete red blood cell.

AB  - Summary 1 By using indomethacin to inhibit their intramural synthesis, we have investigated the contribution of prostaglandins to the maintenance of (a) the intrinsic tone of isolated smooth muscle preparations and (b) contractions produced by drugs or high oxygen concentration. 2 When treated with indomethacin, the rat stomach strip and chick rectum preparation slowly relaxed, whether they were bathed in Krebs solution or blood. Although their sensitivity to added prostaglandin was somewhat enhanced, they became insensitive to changes in oxygen or glucose concentration. However, another smooth muscle preparation, the rat colon, was neither relaxed by indomethacin nor contracted by high oxygen concentration. 3 These results support the hypothesis that intramural generation of prostaglandin maintains the tone of some smooth muscle preparations. 4 Contractions of the guinea-pig isolated colon were induced by histamine. These contractions were normally well maintained but in Krebs solution lacking either oxygen or glucose, only the initial spike contraction remained. In the presence of indomethacin the histamine contraction was also poorly sustained, but maintenance was restored by a low concentration of prostaglandin E2. 5 Thus, the effects on smooth muscle of oxygen or glucose lack may also be mediated by reduction in the synthesis or effects of an intramural prostaglandin. Extension of this hypothesis to intestinal and vascular smooth muscle in vivo is discussed.
