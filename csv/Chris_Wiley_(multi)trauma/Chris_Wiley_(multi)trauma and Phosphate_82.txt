AB  - Key points Mechano-gated two-pore-domain potassium (K2P) channels are expressed in the human bladder, with TREK-1 being the predominant functional subunit. TREK-1 channels in bladder smooth muscle are activated by membrane stretch and negative pressure applied to the patch pipette. Inhibition of TREK-1 channels in the human detrusor significantly delays relaxation of bladder smooth muscle and triggers small-amplitude spontaneous contractions in response to stretch. Application of negative pressure to cell-attached patches (?20 mmHg) causes a 19-fold increase in the open probability (NPo) of human TREK-1 channels. l-Methionine (1 mm) dramatically decreases the NPo of TREK-1 channels from 0.045 ± 0.003 to 0.008 ± 0.001 (n = 8, P ≤ 0.01). Addition of arachidonic acid (10 ?m) increases the open probability of methionine-inhibited unitary currents up to 0.43 ± 0.05 at 0 mV (n = 9, P ≤ 0.05). TREK-1 channels may serve as a promising pharmacological target for bladder dysfunction in humans. Abstract The mechanisms of mechanosensitivity underlying the response of the human bladder to stretch are poorly understood. Animal data suggest that stretch-activated two-pore-domain (K2P) K+ channels play a critical role in bladder relaxation during the filling phase. The objective of this study was to characterize the expression and function of stretch-activated K2P channels in the human bladder and to clarify their physiological role in bladder mechanosensitivity. Gene and protein analysis of the K2P channels TREK-1, TREK-2 and TRAAK in the human bladder revealed that TREK-1 is the predominantly expressed member of the mechano-gated subfamily of K2P channels. Immunohistochemical labelling of bladder wall identified higher levels of expression of TREK-1 in detrusor smooth muscle cells in comparison to bladder mucosa. Functional characterization and biophysical properties of the predominantly expressed member of the K2P family, the TREK-1 channel, were evaluated by in vitro organ bath studies and the patch-clamp technique. Electrophysiological recordings from single smooth muscle cells confirmed direct activation of TREK-1 channels by mechanical stretch and negative pressure applied to the cell membrane. Inhibition of TREK-1 channels in the human detrusor significantly delayed relaxation of the stretched bladder smooth muscle strips and triggered small-amplitude spontaneous contractions. Application of negative pressure to cell-attached patches (?20 mmHg) caused a 19-fold increase in the open probability (NPo) of human TREK-1 channels. l-Methionine (1 mm), a specific TREK-1 inhibitor, dramatically decreased the NPo of TREK-1 channels from 0.045 ± 0.003 to 0.008 ± 0.001 (n = 8, P ≤ 0.01). Subsequent addition of arachidonic acid (10 ?m), a channel opener, increased the open probability of methionine-inhibited unitary currents up to 0.43 ± 0.05 at 0 mV (n = 9, P ≤ 0.05). The results of our study provide direct evidence that the response of the human detrusor to mechanical stretch is regulated by activation of mechano-gated TREK-1 channels. Impaired mechanosensation and mechanotransduction associated with the changes in stretch-activated K2P channels may underlie myogenic bladder dysfunction in humans.

AB  - Summary 1 By using indomethacin to inhibit their intramural synthesis, we have investigated the contribution of prostaglandins to the maintenance of (a) the intrinsic tone of isolated smooth muscle preparations and (b) contractions produced by drugs or high oxygen concentration. 2 When treated with indomethacin, the rat stomach strip and chick rectum preparation slowly relaxed, whether they were bathed in Krebs solution or blood. Although their sensitivity to added prostaglandin was somewhat enhanced, they became insensitive to changes in oxygen or glucose concentration. However, another smooth muscle preparation, the rat colon, was neither relaxed by indomethacin nor contracted by high oxygen concentration. 3 These results support the hypothesis that intramural generation of prostaglandin maintains the tone of some smooth muscle preparations. 4 Contractions of the guinea-pig isolated colon were induced by histamine. These contractions were normally well maintained but in Krebs solution lacking either oxygen or glucose, only the initial spike contraction remained. In the presence of indomethacin the histamine contraction was also poorly sustained, but maintenance was restored by a low concentration of prostaglandin E2. 5 Thus, the effects on smooth muscle of oxygen or glucose lack may also be mediated by reduction in the synthesis or effects of an intramural prostaglandin. Extension of this hypothesis to intestinal and vascular smooth muscle in vivo is discussed.

AB  - Abstract:? Melatonin, an endogenously produced neurohormone secreted mainly by the pineal gland, has a variety of physiological functions and neuroprotective effects. Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) have been known to induce neurotoxicity and oxidative stress in central nervous system injuries and neurodegenerative pathologies. However, the effect of melatonin on SFAs-induced cytotoxicity in astroglial cells, if any, has remained to be explored. This study reports that in primary cultured astroglial cells, melatonin significantly attenuated palmitic acid (PA)-induced cytotoxicity in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Additionally, melatonin effectively suppressed PA-induced reactive oxygen species generation and prevented PA-induced apoptosis whereby the rise in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activation in astroglial cells was inhibited. However, it did not appear to exert an obvious effect on PA-induced intracellular calcium overload. Luzindole, a nonselective melatonin receptor antagonist, attenuated melatonin?s promotion effect of cell survival and Stat3 phosphorylation, indicating that melatonin exerts its protective property in astroglial cells, at least in part, through the activation of membrane receptors and then Stat3 signaling pathway. Finally, melatonin had an inhibitory effect on the pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression. The results suggest that melatonin may be an effective cytoprotective agent against PA-based cytotoxicity through modulating cell survival and inflammatory response in astroglial cells.

Materials and Methods Thirty-three participants with no history of guided bone regeneration or soft tissue augmentation underwent dental implant placement with different types of connections. The dimensions of the buccal alveolar bone and soft tissue were evaluated immediately and at 1 year after prosthesis from reconstructions of cross-sectional cone-beam computed tomography images. Results The vertical and horizontal loss of buccal bone and soft tissue around implants with conical connections were lower than around those with external or internal connections. Statistically significant negative correlations were observed between initial horizontal bone thickness and changes in vertical bone and soft tissue height (p?<?.05), and between initial horizontal soft tissue thickness and the change in vertical soft tissue height (p?<?.05). Conclusion Implants with a conical connection preserve peri-implant alveolar bone and soft tissue more effectively than other connection types. Furthermore, the initial buccal alveolar bone and soft tissue thickness around the implant platform may influence their vertical dimensional changes at 1 year after implant prosthesis.

AB  - Abstract Dimemorfan, an antitussive and a sigma-1 (σ1) receptor agonist, has been reported to display neuroprotective properties. We set up an animal model of ischemic stroke injury by inducing cerebral ischemia (for 1?h) followed by reperfusion (for 24?h) (CI/R) in rats to examine the protective effects and action mechanisms of dimemorfan against stroke-induced damage. Treatment with dimemorfan (1.0??g/kg and 10??g/kg, i.v.) either 15?min before ischemia or at the time of reperfusion, like the putative σ1 receptor agonist, PRE084 (10??g/kg, i.v.), ameliorated the size of the infarct zone by 67?72% or 51?52%, respectively, which was reversed by pre-treatment with the selective σ1 receptor antagonist, BD1047 (20??g/kg, i.v.). Major pathological mechanisms leading to CI/R injury including excitotoxicity, oxidative/nitrosative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis are all downstream events initiated by excessive accumulation of extracellular glutamate. Dimemorfan treatment (10??g/kg, i.v., at the time of reperfusion) inhibited the expressions of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-1?, which occurred in parallel with decreases in neutrophil infiltration, activation of inflammation-related signals (p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor-?B, and signal transducer and activator of transcription-1), expression of neuronal and inducible nitric oxide synthase, oxidative/nitrosative tissue damage (lipid peroxidation, protein nitrosylation, and 8-hydroxy-guanine formation), and apoptosis in the ipsilateral cortex after CI/R injury. Dimemorfan treatment at the time of reperfusion, although did not prevent an early rise of glutamate level, significantly prevented subsequent glutamate accumulation after reperfusion. This inhibitory effect was lasted for more than 4?h and was reversed by pre-treatment with BD1047. These results suggest that dimemorfan activates the σ1 receptor to reduce glutamate accumulation and then suppresses initiation of inflammation-related events and signals as well as induction of oxidative and nitrosative stresses, leading to reductions in tissue damage and cell death. In conclusion, our results demonstrate for the first time that dimemorfan exhibits protective effects against ischemic stroke in CI/R rats probably through modulation of σ1 receptor-dependent signals to prevent subsequent glutamate accumulation and its downstream pathologic events.

AB  - Abstract Background Sarcopenia is linked to functional impairments, loss of independence, and mortality. In the past few years, obesity has been established as being a risk factor for a decline in muscle mass and function. There are several molecular pathological mechanisms, which have been under discussion that might explain this relationship. However, most studies were conducted using male animals and for a short period of time. Methods In this study, the gender-specific effect of long-term, high-fat content feeding in Sprague?Dawley rats was examined. Development of the quadriceps muscle of the animals was monitored in vivo using magnetic resonance. The results of these measurements and of the biochemical analysis of the aged muscle were compared. Results Surprisingly, only male but not female rats showed a decline in muscle cross-sectional area at 16 months of age as a result of a chronic oversupply of dietary fats. This loss of muscle mass could not be explained by either de-regulation of the anabolic Akt pathway or by up-regulation of the main ubiquitin ligases of muscle, MAFbx and MuRF-1. However, fusion of satellite cells to myotubes was induced by the high-fat diet in male rats, possibly as a result of an increased need for compensatory regeneration processes. Caspase-3-dependent apoptosis induction, irrespective of diet, seems to be the major determinant of muscle decline during ageing in male but not female rats. Conclusion Taken together, activation of the apoptosis-inducing Caspase-3 seems to be the most important trigger for the age-related muscle loss. Male rats were more prone to the decline of muscle during ageing than female animals, which was further enforced by a long-term, high fat diet.

AB  - Abstract Emerging evidence supports the involvement of autophagy in the pathogenesis of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play fundamental roles in various cellular processes, including autophagy. However, it remains largely unknown as to how autophagy is regulated by miRNAs and lncRNAs in IDD. Biological functions of miR-153-3p and long intergenic nonprotein coding RNA 641 (LINC00641) were investigated. Luciferase reporter assays was done to validate miR-153-3p targets. To induce nutritional stress, nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were cultured in the normal nutritional condition and the low nutritional condition. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to analyze miR-153-3p and LINC00641 in response to nutrient deprivation. Autophagic activity was assessed by transmission electron microscopy, western blot analysis and green fluorescent protein-light chain 3 puncta. Pull-down assay and RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization were performed to validate LINC00641 target and the location. MiR-153-3p is downregulated in NP tissues from IDD patients. Further, LINC00641 can affect collagen II and matrix metalloproteinase-3 expressions. Upregulation of LINC00641 and downregulation of miR-153-3p are detected in NP cells under nutritional stress. LINC00641 can regulate autophagic cell death by targeting miR-153-3p and autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5). MiR-153-3p inhibits autophagy and IDD by targeting ATG5. More important, LINC00641 targets miR-153-3p, and thus affects ATG5 expression, autophagic cell death and IDD. These findings uncover a novel regulatory pathway that is composed of LINC00641, miR-153-3p, and ATG5 in IDD. This mechanism may stimulate to a more understanding of IDD pathogenesis and provide new sights for the treatment of this disorder.

AB  - Abstract We previously identified a partial Dermacentor variabilis cDNA encoding ferritin HC (HC) subunit homolog (DVFER) that was differentially upregulated in Rickettsia montanensis infected ticks (Mulenga et al., 2003a). We have used rapid amplification of cDNA ends to clone full-length DVFER cDNA and its apparent ortholog from the wood tick, D. andersoni (DAFER), both of which show high sequence similarity to vertebrate than insect ferritin. Both DVFER and DAFER contain the stem?loop structure of a putative iron responsive element in the 5? untranslated region (nucleotide positions, 16?42) and the feroxidase centre loop typical for vertebrate ferritin HC subunits. Quantitative Western and Northern blotting analyses of protein and RNA from unfed and partially fed whole tick as well as dissected tick tissues demonstrated that DVFER is constitutively and ubiquitously expressed. Based on densitometric analysis of detected protein and mRNA bands, DVFER is predominantly expressed in the midgut, and to a lesser extent in the salivary glands, ovary and fatbody. Sham treatment (mechanical injury) and Escherichia coli challenge of D. variabilis ticks stimulated statistically significant (≈ 1.5- and ≈ 3.0-fold, respectively) increases in DVFER mRNA abundance over time point matched naive control ticks. These data suggest that DVFER mRNA is nonspecifically up regulated in response to mechanical injury or bacterial infection induced stress.
