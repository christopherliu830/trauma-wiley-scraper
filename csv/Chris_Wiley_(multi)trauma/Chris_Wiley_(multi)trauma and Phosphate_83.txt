AB  - Summary In this chapter, we investigate the impact of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in scaffold-based tissue engineering and its potential for tissue regenerative medicine. Scaffold-based tissue engineering aims to develop functionalized tissues/organs for repair and regeneration of damaged or diseased body parts by employing engineered matrices called scaffolds cultured with cells and bioactive molecules. iPSCs are adult cells that have been genetically reprogrammed into an embryonic-cell-like state. Owing to their unique regenerative capacity, iPSCs have attracted the attention of the biomedical community and demonstrated their capability as an invaluable cell source for cell therapy and for scaffold-based tissue engineering. However, the underlying mechanism of the interaction of iPSCs with three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds is unclear, which is very essential to realize the full potential of iPSCs in engineering functional tissues and organs. In this chapter, we therefore review the impact of iPSCs in scaffold-based tissue engineering and its potential for tissue regenerative medicine. The techniques employed for the culture of iPSCs into 3D scaffolds, the effect of the 3D microenvironment in controlling iPSCs' fate and function, and the potential applications of iPSCs in tissue engineering are discussed with illustrated examples. The chapter is expected to be useful for readers to gain insight into the impact of iPSCs in various 3D scaffold-based tissue engineering fields such as bone, cartilage, cardiac, skin, and neural tissue engineering.

AB  - ABSTRACT With the use of novel formulary technology, unique moisturizing hand gels have been developed that offer significant advantages in perioperative and other health care settings. These advantages include the time-saving capabilities of a waterless formulation, the persistence and effectiveness of a surgical scrub, and the moisturization and protective properties of a lotion. Extensive laboratory and clinical studies, involving in vivo antimicrobial activity against resident and transient flora, skin moisturization on normal and dry skin, and compatibility with latex gloves, have supported these advantages. Nondrying alcohol hand gels can be used for antiseptic hand washing, hand scrubs between procedures (ie, reentry scrubs), brushless surgical scrubs, moisturizers, and glove-donning aids.

AB  - Microglial cells are critical for glioma growth and progression. However, only little is known about intratumoral microglial behavior and the dynamic interaction with the tumor. Currently the scarce understanding of microglial appearance in malignant gliomas merely originates from histological studies and in vitro investigations. In order to understand the pattern of microglia activity, motility and migration we designed an intravital study in an orthotopic murine glioma model using CX3CR1-eGFPGFP/wt mice. We analysed the dynamics of intratumoral microglia accumulation and activity, as well as microglia/tumor blood vessel interaction by epi-illumination and 2-photon laser scanning microscopy. We further investigated cellular and tissue function, including the enzyme activity of intratumoral and microglial NADPH oxidase measured by in vivo fluorescence lifetime imaging. We identified three morphological phenotypes of tumor-associated microglia cells with entirely different motility patterns. We found that NADPH oxidase activation is highly divergent in these microglia subtypes leading to different production levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We observed that microglia motility is highest within the perivascular niche, suggesting relevance of microglia/tumor blood vessel interactions. In line, reduction of tumor blood vessels by antivascular therapy confirmed the relevance of the tumor vessel compartment on microglia biology in brain tumors. In summary, we provide new insights into in vivo microglial behavior, regarding both morphology and function, in malignant gliomas. GLIA 2016;64:1210?1226

AB  - ABSTRACT Foot ulcers and poor wound healing are problematic for patients with diabetes. The beehive protectant Propolis can improve wound healing but whether it can improve healing in diabetic wounds has not been investigated. In this study, the effect of a single application of Propolis on epithelial closure, wound morphology, cellular infiltrate, and blood vessel density were investigated. Diabetes was induced in rats using streptozocin. After 6 weeks, diabetic and control animals were wounded and the wounds were treated with Propolis or saline as control. At days 6 and 12 animals were sacrificed and wounds were excised. Compared with controls, diabetes decreased epithelial closure and reepithelialization but had no effect on wound contraction. These delays were prevented by Propolis. At day 12, the impaired macrophage infiltration (C:1.49±0.09 vs. D:0.25±0.14), persistent neutrophil infiltration (C:0.22±0.19 vs. D:1.33±0.81), and increased myeloperoxidase activity (fourfold) in diabetic wounds were prevented by Propolis. Diabetes had no effect on wound volume, vessel number, or branch points. These novel data indicate that Propolis can accelerate wound healing in diabetes. As neutrophil infiltration is normalized, its mechanism of action may be through anti-inflammatory pathways. This result and the established safety profile of Propolis provide a rationale for studying topical application of this agent in a clinical setting.

AB  - Abstract Objectives In dental tissue engineering, niche is important for maintaining stem cell function and regenerating the dental tissues. However, there is limited knowledge for the growth factors in niche to maintain the function of stem cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of IGF2, a growth factor in stem cells from apical papilla (SCAPs) niche, on differentiation and proliferation potentials of SCAPs. Materials and methods Recombinant human IGF2 protein (rhIGF2) was used. Cell counting kit-8 assay, Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester assay, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, Alizarin Red staining, quantitative calcium analysis, immunofluorescence staining and real-time RT-PCR were performed to investigate the cell proliferation and differentiation potentials of SCAPs. And proteomic analysis was used to identify the differential secreted proteins. Results By ALP activity assay, we found that 5 ng/mL rhIGF2 might be the optimal concentration for treatment. Then, Alizarin Red staining, quantitative calcium analysis and osteogenesis-related gene expression results showed that 5 ng/mL rhIGF2 could enhance the osteo-/dentinogenic differentiation potentials in SCAPs. Immunofluorescence staining and real-time RT-PCR results showed that neurogenic markers were significantly induced by 5 ng/mL rhIGF2 in SCAPs. Then, CCK-8 assay and CFSE assay results showed that 5 ng/mL rhIGF2 could enhance the cell proliferation in SCAPs. Furthermore, proteomic analysis showed that IGF2 could induce some secreted proteins which function related to the osteogenesis, neurogenesis and cell proliferation. Conclusions Our results identified that IGF2 might be the potential mediator in niche to promote SCAP function and dental tissue regeneration.

AB  - SUMMARY.? Persistent angiomatous nodules and plaques about the ears and scalp with distinctive histological features are described. Of the 12 women and 2 men affected, 9 showed involvement of the external auditory meatus, the pinna or the retroauricular fold. Three patients presented with lesions in the occipital region and solitary nodules affecting the nasolabial fold and forehead occurred in 2 patients. Eight patients had multiple lesions with bleeding and pruritus as the main symptoms. Several recurred after removal. The characteristic histological features were the presence of abnormal hypertrophied capillaries with greatly swollen endothelial cells and an associated lympho-histiocytic and eosinophil infiltrate. The abnormal endothelial cells showed absent or greatly diminished alkaline phosphatase activity, but enhanced reactions were obtained to certain hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes as compared to normal capillary endothelium. Pseudopyogenic granuloma appears to be an entirely benign reactive condition. Its relationship to ordinary pyogenic granuloma and to subcutaneous angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia is discussed.
