AB  - Abstract Aims Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) affects women both acutely and chronically after vaginal delivery. Current SUI treatments assume the neuromuscular continence mechanism, comprised of the pudendal nerve (PN) and external urethral sphincter (EUS), is either intact or irreparable. This study investigated the ability of neurotrophin therapy to facilitate recovery of the neuromuscular continence mechanism. Methods Virgin, Sprague Dawley rats received simulated childbirth injury or sham injury and treatment with continuous infusion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or saline placebo to the site of PN injury. Continence was assessed by leak point pressure (LPP) and EUS electromyography (EMG) 14 and 21 days after injury. Structural recovery was assessed histologically. Molecular assessment of the muscular and neuroregenerative response was determined via measurement of EUS BDNF and PN ?II-tubulin expression respectively, 4, 8, and 12 days after injury. Results Following injury, LPP was significantly reduced with saline compared to either BDNF treatment or sham injury. Similarly, compared to sham injury, resting EUS EMG amplitude and firing rate, as well as amplitude during LPP were significantly reduced with saline but not BDNF treatment. Histology confirmed improved EUS recovery with BDNF treatment. EUS BDNF and PN ?II-tubulin expression demonstrated that BDNF treatment improved the neurogenerative response and may facilitate sphincteric recovery. Conclusions Continuous targeted neurotrophin therapy accelerates continence recovery after simulated childbirth injury likely through stimulating neuroregeneration and facilitating EUS recovery and re-innervation. Neurotrophins or other therapies targeting neuromuscular regeneration may be useful for treating SUI related to failure of the neuromuscular continence mechanism. Neurourol.

AB  - Robocasting, a solid freeform fabrication technique, was used to develop lattices of hydroxyapatite (HA) that show promise as load-bearing scaffolds for bone repair. Additionally, the lattice scaffolds can be shaped into customized implants. A computed tomography (CT) scan of a damaged mandible was utilized to noninvasively design a lattice implant that could fill the damaged region. In a case study, the fit of the custom lattice scaffold was tested in a damaged mandible and ?fit like a glove.? Such implants may be able to replace numerous autograft procedures, thereby reducing surgical cost and complications associated with bone harvesting surgery.

AB  - Abstract The blood-brain barrier is a gatekeeper and modulatory interface for the CNS. Cerebral endothelial cells are the major component of the blood-brain barrier, and they modify inflammatory signals from the circulation to the CNS by production and secretion of secondary substances. The inflammatory mediators induced by tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) were determined by microarray analysis of RBE4 cerebral endothelial cells, at 0, 6, 12, or 24?h after TNF treatment. Interleukin (IL)-15 and its receptors were among the most robustly up-regulated genes. This was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and western blotting. The three subunits of the IL15 receptor complex (IL15Rα, IL2R?, and IL2R?) showed differential regulation by TNF in their time course and amplitude of increased expression. Consistent with increased expression of the specific high affinity receptor IL15Rα, TNF increased cellular uptake of 125I-IL15 and enhanced the fluorescent intensity of Alexa568-IL15 in RBE4 cells. TNF treatment in mice also increased the level of expression of IL15 receptors in enriched cerebral microvessels. We conclude that the cerebral microvascular IL15 system is a novel inflammatory mediator that transduces the actions of TNF.

AB  - The essential trace element zinc (Zn) has a large number of physiologic roles, in particular being required for growth and functioning of the immune system. Adaptive mechanisms enable the body to maintain normal total body Zn status over a wide range of intakes, but deficiency can occur because of reduced absorption or increased gastrointestinal losses. Deficiency impairs physiologic processes, leading to clinical consequences that include failure to thrive, skin rash, and impaired wound healing. Mild deficiency that is not clinically overt may still cause nonspecific consequences, such as susceptibility to infection and poor growth. The plasma Zn concentration has poor sensitivity and specificity as a test of deficiency. Consequently, diagnosis of deficiency requires a combination of clinical assessment and biochemical tests. Patients receiving parenteral nutrition (PN) are susceptible to Zn deficiency and its consequences. Nutrition support teams should have a strategy for assessing Zn status and optimizing this by appropriate supplementation. Nutrition guidelines recommend generous Zn provision from the start of PN. This review covers the physiology of Zn, the consequences of its deficiency, and the assessment of its status, before discussing its role in PN.
