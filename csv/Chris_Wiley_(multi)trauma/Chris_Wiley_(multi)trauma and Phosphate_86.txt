AB  - Abstract Background:? The aim of this study was to establish a standardized approach to the initial care of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS). DKA and HHS are metabolic emergencies. Effective and efficient management is the responsibility of the multidisciplinary team. The admission of patients to the intensive care unit (ICU) with DKA and HHS is rare, and management of patients? diverse problems is prone to error because of a lack of familiarity. Aim:? The paper?s aim is to set the developmental process of a clinical guideline following a review of the literature. Discussion:? This clinical guideline is based on a review of the evidence available within the literature in the early phase of resuscitation. Collaborative working among the multidisciplinary team through clinical practice group was the method adopted. Management of DKA and HHS is divided into three main areas: intravenous fluid replacement, insulin therapy and electrolyte management. The controversy associated with the administration of sodium bicarbonate is discussed. Conclusion:? Effective treatment requires a rapid initial assessment of the patient based on current medical history and clinical presentation. To this end, a quick reference algorithm and guide to management were also developed. Key criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of treatment are provided and complications of treatment are addressed. The formation of the practice development group that led to this innovation is outlined, and in conclusion, the success of the group is reflected upon.

AB  - Abstract This Progress Report reviews recent advances in the utility of extracellular matrix (ECM)-mimic biomaterials in presenting and delivering therapeutic cells to promote tissue healing. This overview gives a brief introduction of different cell types being used in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering while addressing critical issues that must be overcome before cell-based approaches can be routinely employed in the clinic. A selection of five commonly used cell-associated, biomaterial platforms (collagen, hyaluronic acid, fibrin, alginate, and poly(ethylene glycol)) are reviewed for treatment of a number of acute injury or diseases with emphasis on animal models and clinical trials. This article concludes with current challenges and future perspectives regarding foreign body host response to biomaterials and immunological reactions to allogeneic or xenogeneic cells, vascularization and angiogenesis, matching mechanical strength and anisotropy of native tissues, as well as other non-technical issues regarding the clinical translation of biomatrix/cell-based therapies.

AB  - In the past decade, advances in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) have revolutionized untargeted metabolomics analyses. By mining metabolomes more deeply, researchers are now primed to uncover key metabolites and their associations with diseases. The employment of untargeted metabolomics has led to new biomarker discoveries and a better mechanistic understanding of diseases with applications in precision medicine. However, many major pertinent challenges remain. First, compound identification has been poor, and left an overwhelming number of unidentified peaks. Second, partial, incomplete metabolomes persist due to factors such as limitations in mass spectrometry data acquisition speeds, wide-range of metabolites concentrations, and cellular/tissue/temporal-specific expression changes that confound our understanding of metabolite perturbations. Third, to contextualize metabolites in pathways and biology is difficult because many metabolites partake in multiple pathways, have yet to be described species specificity, or possess unannotated or more-complex functions that are not easily characterized through metabolomics analyses. From a translational perspective, information related to novel metabolite biomarkers, metabolic pathways, and drug targets might be sparser than they should be. Thankfully, significant progress has been made and novel solutions are emerging, achieved through sustained academic and industrial community efforts in terms of hardware, computational, and experimental approaches. Given the rapidly growing utility of metabolomics, this review will offer new perspectives, increase awareness of the major challenges in LC-MS metabolomics that will significantly benefit the metabolomics community and also the broader the biomedical community metabolomics aspire to serve.

AB  - Abstract In this article, both sodium magnetic resonance (MR) and T1? relaxation mapping aimed at measuring molecular changes in cartilage for the diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis are reviewed. First, an introduction to structure of cartilage, its degeneration in osteoarthritis (OA) and an outline of diagnostic imaging methods in quantifying molecular changes and early diagnostic aspects of cartilage degeneration are described. The sodium MRI section begins with a brief overview of the theory of sodium NMR of biological tissues and is followed by a section on multiple quantum filters that can be used to quantify both bi-exponential relaxation and residual quadrupolar interaction. Specifically, (i) the rationale behind the use of sodium MRI in quantifying proteoglycan (PG) changes, (ii) validation studies using biochemical assays, (iii) studies on human OA specimens, (iv) results on animal models and (v) clinical imaging protocols are reviewed. Results demonstrating the feasibility of quantifying PG in OA patients and comparison with that in healthy subjects are also presented. The section concludes with the discussion of advantages and potential issues with sodium MRI and the impact of new technological advancements (e.g. ultra-high field scanners and parallel imaging methods). In the theory section on T1?, a brief description of (i) principles of measuring T1? relaxation, (ii) pulse sequences for computing T1? relaxation maps, (iii) issues regarding radio frequency power deposition, (iv) mechanisms that contribute to T1? in biological tissues and (v) effects of exchange and dipolar interaction on T1? dispersion are discussed. Correlation of T1? relaxation rate with macromolecular content and biomechanical properties in cartilage specimens subjected to trypsin and cytokine-induced glycosaminoglycan depletion and validation against biochemical assay and histopathology are presented. Experimental T1? data from osteoarthritic specimens, animal models, healthy human subjects and as well from osteoarthritic patients are provided. The current status of T1? relaxation mapping of cartilage and future directions is also discussed. Copyright ? 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
