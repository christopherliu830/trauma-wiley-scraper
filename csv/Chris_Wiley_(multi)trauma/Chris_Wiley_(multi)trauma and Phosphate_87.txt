AB  - Abstract An unusual case of breast carcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells (OGCs) was reported, for which the diagnosis was made by aspiration biopsy. The OGCs appeared to derive from large mononuclear cells, probably via their cellular fusion. The mononuclear cells had abundant lysosome-like granules, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria. They were thought to be histiocytic cells, though active phagocytosis could not be demonstrated. Histologically, the tumor showed a pattern of well differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma, of which the stroma was crowded with histiocytic cells, OGCs, and lymphocytes. Marked hemorrhage and fibrosis were also seen. The tumor cells tended to be distorted and greatly diminished in accord with the accumulation of OGCs. Cancer 52:74-78, 1983.

AB  - Variation in water-holding capacity (WHC), which presents a major economic burden to the swine industry, is considered to be underpinned by variation at a molecular and biochemical level. High-resolution 2D DIGE followed by MS analysis and Western blot were used to unravel the proteome of muscle exudate, collected following centrifugation, in the pH 4?7 range. A first 2DE-based protein map of this substrate was produced where 89 spots were successfully characterised. Two phenotypes divergent for WHC plus one intermediate were compared with a view to deciphering the biochemical processes impacting on variation in WHC. Twenty spots were observed to be altered across the phenotypes. Of these, 14 represented sixteen proteins including metabolic enzymes, stress response proteins and structural proteins. Triosephosphate isomerase and transferrin showed a major difference between the two extreme phenotypes, and may have potential as biological markers for WHC prediction. Several members of the HSPs family were highlighted. This proteomic study makes an important contribution towards a more detailed molecular view of the processes behind WHC and will provide a valuable resource for future investigations.

AB  - Summary Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic and poly-aetiological autoimmune disease characterized by the production of antibodies to autologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) which serve as diagnostic and prognostic markers. The defective clearance of apoptotic material, together with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), provides abundant chromatin or self-dsDNA to trigger the production of anti-dsDNA antibodies, although the mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In SLE patients, the immune complex (IC) of dsDNA and its autoantibodies trigger the robust type I interferon (IFN-I) production through intracellular DNA sensors, which drives the adaptive immune system to break down self-tolerance. In this review, we will discuss the potential resources of self-dsDNA, the mechanisms of self-dsDNA-mediated inflammation through various DNA sensors and its functions in SLE pathogenesis.

AB  - Summary The aim of this study was to explore the effects and mechanisms of Icarisid II (ICA-II) on enhancing the cellular cGMP in rat corpus cavernosum tissue (RCCT). Diabetes mellitus Wistar rats were induced by streptozotocin, and diabetic ED rats were selected for the RCCT culture by apomorphine. ICA-II was extracted and purified from Icariin (ICA) by enzymatic method. The RCCT was treated with ICA-II, ICA and Sildenafil at different concentrations. cGMP and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activities were checked respectively by enzyme immunoassay. Meanwhile, nNOS, iNOS and eNOS in RCCT were checked by western blot. ICA-II evaluated the intracellular cGMP to 8.01?±?1.02?pmol?mg?1?min?1, which is much weaker than that from Sildenafil (12.4?±?1.16?pmol?mg?1?min?1) (P?<?0.05). There is no significant difference between ICA-II and ICA. With the treatment of 10??m ICA-II for 24 and 48?h, nNOS expression was significantly increased in RCCT (P?<?0.05), while the eNOS expression level was very low without any change. Notably, ICA-II increased the intracellular NOS activity significantly in vitro in RCCT. Except the PDE5 inhibitory effect, ICA-II increases the intracellular cGMP through the enhancement of nNOS expression and NOS activity in RCCT in vitro. ICA-II implies a potential compound for neurogenic erectile dysfunction by NO?cGMP pathway.

AB  - Abstract Among the earliest invariant neuropathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the degeneration of vulnerable hippocampal CA1 and subicular pyramidal neurons. Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) is a secreted protein that functions in signaling growth cone collapse, chemorepulsion and neuronal apoptosis during early development of the central nervous system. In this report we show that accumulation of an internalized form of Sema3A is associated with degeneration of neurons in vulnerable fields of the hippocampus during AD. Accumulation of Sema3A overlaps the appearance of phosphorylated MAP1B and tau in many neurons, suggesting that Sema3A signaling at some level may be coupled to these previously identified cytoskeletal markers of neurodegeneration. Consistent with this, we isolated and partially characterized a multiprotein complex from the hippocampus of patients with AD that contains phosphorylated MAP1B, collapsin-response mediator protein 2 (CRMP-2), Plexins A1 and A2, and a processed form of Sema3A. A model is presented in which aberrant release of Sema3A from expressing neurons in the subiculum during AD results in the internalization and transport of Sema3A from this field to CA1. Within the context of the myriad of potential insults that contribute to Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, the bioactivity of Sema3A may contribute either directly to neurodegeneration by inducing neuronal collapse, or indirectly by abrogating the recovery capabilities of adult neurons faced with these insults.

AB  - Summary The field of pediatric urolithiasis has and continues to change at a remarkable pace. Particularly in the Western world, the incidence has been rising exponentially. Today, the recurrent nature of pediatric stone disease and, hence, the need for metabolic assessment and follow-up, is recognized worldwide. Minimally invasive techniques for stone clearance have replaced open surgery and are now available even for the youngest patients. The aim of any intervention is to render the child stone-free whilst minimizing the impact of the procedure(s) on the child. Complications relate mostly to infection, bleeding, iatrogenic injury, urine leak, pain, obstruction, recurrence of stones and loss of renal function. Optimal treatment modality depends on stone burden, composition, location and size, symptoms and complications, as well as patient factors. Technological advances in equipment are continuing at a dramatic pace and are likely to transform the face of urolithiasis surgery once again in the next decades.

AB  - The exploration of stem and progenitor cells holds promise for advancing our understanding of the biology of tissue repair and regeneration mechanisms after injury. This will also help in the future use of stem cell therapy for the development of regenerative medicine approaches for the treatment of different tissue-species defects or disorders such as bone, cartilages, and tooth defects or disorders. Bone is a specialized connective tissue, with mineralized extracellular components that provide bones with both strength and rigidity, and thus enable bones to function in body mechanical supports and necessary locomotion process. New insights have been added to the use of different types of stem cells in bone and tooth defects over the last few years. In this concise review, we briefly describe bone structure as well as summarize recent research progress and accumulated information regarding the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells, as well as stem cell contributions to bone repair/regeneration, bone defects or disorders, and both restoration and regeneration of bones and cartilages. We also discuss advances in the osteogenic differentiation and bone regeneration of dental and periodontal stem cells as well as in stem cell contributions to dentine regeneration and tooth engineering.

AB  - Summary A colonoscopy is a challenging procedure for both novice and veteran endoscopists. The biggest obstacle is a relatively high prevalence of an abnormal fixation of the descending, and to a lesser extent, the ascending colon which makes a colonoscopy far more difficult and, occasionally impossible, to complete even for experts. However, an experienced endoscopist is capable of managing the majority of cases successfully by using precise techniques and an ?intuitive? sense of the ?upstream? colon, acquired during years of practice. In contrast, beginners often create problems for themselves by resorting to inappropriate maneuvers, thereby transforming the colon into a twisted, distended, and rigid tube. This chapter is designed to minimize these ?painful? mistakes by a thorough discussion of several important topics including: indications, preparation, and specifics of procedural sedation, equipment, embryology of the colon, endoscopic anatomy, torque-steering technique, complications, and endoscopic characteristics of common, and some rare diseases.
