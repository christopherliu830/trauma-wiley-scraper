AB  - Summary The aim of this study was to explore the effects and mechanisms of Icarisid II (ICA-II) on enhancing the cellular cGMP in rat corpus cavernosum tissue (RCCT). Diabetes mellitus Wistar rats were induced by streptozotocin, and diabetic ED rats were selected for the RCCT culture by apomorphine. ICA-II was extracted and purified from Icariin (ICA) by enzymatic method. The RCCT was treated with ICA-II, ICA and Sildenafil at different concentrations. cGMP and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activities were checked respectively by enzyme immunoassay. Meanwhile, nNOS, iNOS and eNOS in RCCT were checked by western blot. ICA-II evaluated the intracellular cGMP to 8.01?±?1.02?pmol?mg?1?min?1, which is much weaker than that from Sildenafil (12.4?±?1.16?pmol?mg?1?min?1) (P?<?0.05). There is no significant difference between ICA-II and ICA. With the treatment of 10??m ICA-II for 24 and 48?h, nNOS expression was significantly increased in RCCT (P?<?0.05), while the eNOS expression level was very low without any change. Notably, ICA-II increased the intracellular NOS activity significantly in vitro in RCCT. Except the PDE5 inhibitory effect, ICA-II increases the intracellular cGMP through the enhancement of nNOS expression and NOS activity in RCCT in vitro. ICA-II implies a potential compound for neurogenic erectile dysfunction by NO?cGMP pathway.

AB  - Abstract Previous work of our group stated that exogenously added and endogenous nitric oxide (NO) generated by cytokines induce apoptosis in chromaffin cells. In this work, we investigate the specific regulation of the NO synthase (NOS) isoforms, inducible NOS (iNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS), and their particular participation in cell death induced by interferon gamma (IFN?). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IFN? increase iNOS expression, with no effect on nNOS expression. On the other hand, dexamethasone increases basal nNOS expression but decreases LPS?+?IFN?-induced iNOS expression. IFN?-induced cell death was abolished by W-1400, a specific iNOS inhibitor, but only partially by nNOS inhibitors [N-?-propyl-l-arginine (N-PLA), 3-Bromo-7-nitroindazol (7-NI), l-methyl thiocitrulline and N-methyl l-arginine], indicating the main iNOS participation in chromaffin cell death. IFN? and LPS induce nuclear factor ?B (NF?B) translocation to the nucleus, a process implicated in activation of iNOS expression, as inhibition of NF?B translocation, by SN50, decreased iNOS expression. In addition, IFN? and LPS induce 847Ser-nNOS phosphorylation, inhibiting nNOS activity. Both processes, nNOS phosphorylation and iNOS expression induced by LPS?+?IFN?, are regulated by Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway, as IFN? increases 727STAT-3 phosphorylation and specific inhibitors of JAK/STAT pathway, such as AG490, inhibited both processes. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis of an inactivating phosphorylation of nNOS by IFN?, via JAK/STAT, in bovine chromaffin cells. Low NO concentrations achieved by this event, would activate NF?B translocation, increasing iNOS expression and generating, this last, high apoptotic NO concentrations.

AB  - Abstract Human adipose-derived microvascular endothelial cells (HAMEC) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been shown to bear angiogenic and vasculogenic capabilities. We hypothesize that co-culturing HAMEC:MSC on a porous biodegradable scaffold in vitro, later implanted as a graft around femoral blood vessels in a rat, will result in its vascularization by host vessels, creating a functional vascular flap that can effectively treat a range of large full-thickness soft tissue defects. HAMEC were co-cultured with MSC on polymeric three-dimensional porous constructs. Grafts were then implanted around the femoral vessels of a rat. To ensure vessel sprouting from the main femoral vessels, grafts were pre-isolated from the surrounding tissue. Graft vascularization was monitored to confirm full vascularization before flap transfer. Flaps were then transferred to treat both abdominal wall and exposed bone and tendon of an ankle defects. Flaps were analysed to determine vascular properties in terms of maturity, functionality and survival of implanted cells. Findings show that pre-isolated grafts bearing the HAMEC:MSC combination promoted formation of highly vascularized flaps, which were better integrated in both defect models. The results of this study show the essentiality of a specific adipose-derived cell combination in successful graft vascularization and integration, two processes crucial for flap survival.

AB  - Summary A colonoscopy is a challenging procedure for both novice and veteran endoscopists. The biggest obstacle is a relatively high prevalence of an abnormal fixation of the descending, and to a lesser extent, the ascending colon which makes a colonoscopy far more difficult and, occasionally impossible, to complete even for experts. However, an experienced endoscopist is capable of managing the majority of cases successfully by using precise techniques and an ?intuitive? sense of the ?upstream? colon, acquired during years of practice. In contrast, beginners often create problems for themselves by resorting to inappropriate maneuvers, thereby transforming the colon into a twisted, distended, and rigid tube. This chapter is designed to minimize these ?painful? mistakes by a thorough discussion of several important topics including: indications, preparation, and specifics of procedural sedation, equipment, embryology of the colon, endoscopic anatomy, torque-steering technique, complications, and endoscopic characteristics of common, and some rare diseases.

AB  - Abstract Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), as a ubiquitous and opportunistic virus, is a matter for consideration in broad-spectrum diseases, specifically in immunocompromised individuals. In recent decades, many studies that have evaluated the role of HCMV in inflammation and malignancies, especially in high-grade gliomas, have reported inconsistent results. Thus, this study was conducted to analyze 97 primary gliomas for human CMV UL83 gene and protein through TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The results were positive for the UL83 gene and pp65 protein in 71% and 24% of samples, respectively. The frequency of HCMV was significantly higher in glioblastomas than other glioma grades (P?<?.01 and P?<?.05 for the UL83 gene and protein, respectively). In addition, the association between the prevalence of HCMV and aging strengthened the virus reactivation hypothesis in gliomas. In conclusion, a high frequency of HCMV infection was found in gliomas that correlated with tumor aggressiveness and age. This study recommends a thorough investigation to determine HCMV infection in gliomas to improve the existing knowledge of its role in glial tumors, its prognostic value, and possible efficient antiviral target therapy.

AB  - Abstract Surfaces of implantable biomedical devices are increasingly engineered to promote their interactions with tissue. However, surfaces that stimulate desirable mammalian cell adhesion, spreading, and proliferation also enable microbial colonization. The biomaterials-associated infection that can result is now a critical clinical problem. We have identified an important mechanism to create a surface that can simultaneously promote healing while reducing the probability of infection. Surfaces are created with submicrometer-sized, non-adhesive microgels patterned on an otherwise cell-adhesive surface. Quantitative force measurements between a staphylococcus and a patterned surface show that the adhesion strength decreases significantly at inter-gel spacings comparable to bacterial dimensions. Time-resolved flow-chamber measurements show that the microbial deposition rate dramatically decreases at these same spacings. Importantly, the adhesion and spreading of osteoblast-like cells is preserved despite the sub-cellular non-adhesive surface features. Since such length-scale-mediated differential interactions do not rely on antibiotics, this mechanism can be particularly significant in mitigating biomaterials-associated infection by antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as MRSA.
