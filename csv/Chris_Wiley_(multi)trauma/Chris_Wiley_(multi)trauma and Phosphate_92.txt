AB  - Summary This section discusses therapy for infectious diseases of the dog and cat. There are a number of infectious diseases listed in this section as chapters. These include Acanthamoeba, Acinetobacter, Actinomyces and Aelorostrongylus abstrusus. This chapters presents details such as the description, zoonotic potential, microbiology/epidemiology, clinical disease, diagnosis, treatment, drug therapy and drug therapy alternatives of each infection discussed environmental exposure to Acanthamoeba is common and typically does not result in infection. Acanthamoeba from corneal samples of cats with refractory conjunctivitis and keratitis. Dogs may present with clinical signs similar to distemper. Mild ocular discharge, anorexia, lethargy, and fever may occur early. Acinetobacter is a gram negative coccobacillus. Aelorostrongylus abstrusus is the most common lungworm of cats and is found worldwide. Diagnosis of A. abstrusus should be considered in any cats with respiratory signs, particularly outdoor cats that hunt. Treatment is difficult and not always required.

AB  - Summary The anesthesia of caged of birds is unique not only from the aspect of anatomy and physiology, but also due to unique requirements for anesthetic equipment, monitoring, and species-specific pharmacology. The medical history and husbandry of the pet bird is essential for preanesthetic evaluation. Body temperature is monitored continuously throughout anesthesia. Appropriate means of physical restraint must be assessed for each patient and appropriate stabilization and supportive care prepared prior to handling. Sedatives and tranquilizers are used to decrease anxiety and fear during induction. However, most tranquilizers lack analgesia. Injectable anesthetics are more commonly used in the field due to the ease of transport compared with inhalant anesthetic delivery equipment. Birds may be more sensitive to the toxic effects of local anesthetics than mammals. Due to the rapid rate at which birds may decompensate under anesthesia, monitoring is the most important aspect of avian anesthesia body weight.

AB  - Abstract Acellular nerves possess the structural and biochemical features similar to those of naive endoneurial tubes, and have been proved bioactive for allogeneil graft in nerve tissue engineering. However, the source of allogenic donators is restricted in clinical treatment. To explore sufficient substitutes for acellular nerve allografts (ANA), we investigated the effectiveness of acellular nerve xenografts (ANX) combined with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) on repairing peripheral nerve injuries. The acellular nerves derived from Sprague-Dawley rats and New Zealand rabbits were prepared, respectively, and BMSCs were implanted into the nerve scaffolds and cultured in vitro. All the grafts were employed to bridge 1 cm rat sciatic nerve gaps. Fifty Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 10 per group): ANA group, ANX group, BMSCs-laden ANA group, BMSCs-laden ANX group, and autologous nerve graft group. At 8 weeks post-transplantation, electrophysiological study was performed and the regenerated nerves were assayed morphologically. Besides, growth-promoting factors in the regenerated tissues following the BMSCs integration were detected. The results indicated that compared with the acellular nerve control groups, nerve regeneration and functional rehabilitation for the xenogenic nervetransplantation integrated with BMSCs were advanced significantly, and the rehabilitation efficacy was comparable with that of the autografting. The expression of neurotrophic factors in the regenerated nerves, together with that of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the spinal cord and muscles were elevated largely. In conclusion, ANX implanted with BMSCs could replace allografts to promote nerve regeneration effectively, which offers a reliable approach for repairing peripheral nerve defects.

AB  - Abstract A prospective randomized clinical trial was undertaken to test the efficacy of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) among previously untreated children receiving abdominal/pelvic irradiation with or without adjuvant chemotherapy who were at risk for weight loss, malnutrition, and complications from treatment. Children were evaluated by weight/height determinations, anthropomorphic measurements, and laboratory studies. TPN was associated with an improved nutritional status during therapy as compared with control patients on ad libitum intake. However, when TPN was discontinued, weight declined and there were no differences among treated and control patients detected at three-month follow-up. Likewise there was no obvious effect from TPN on tolerance to therapy in the adequately nourished child. TPN as initial supportive therapy should be reserved for those children who are malnourished or marginally malnourished at the time of presentation. Close nutritional assessment during treatment is essential since approximately 25% of children undergoing abdominal/pelvic radiotherapy with chemotherapy can be expected to become malnourished during an initial course of therapy.

AB  - The aim of this prospective study was to establish the exact role parenteral nutrition has in the provision of nutritional support to patients receiving antineoplastic therapy. The diagnosis, reasons for implementation, method of delivery and duration of nutritional support were determined. The outcome of nutritional support was established by the percentage change in weight and alteration in body mass index during the period of nutritional support. The results indicate that parenteral nutrition can succesfully maintain the body weight of patients who are unable to receive enteral nutrition whilst receiving anti-neoplastic treatment. However, it is recommended that the provision of parenteral nutrition is evaluated at regular intervals and alternative feeding methods via the enteral feeding route are accessed as soon as possible.
