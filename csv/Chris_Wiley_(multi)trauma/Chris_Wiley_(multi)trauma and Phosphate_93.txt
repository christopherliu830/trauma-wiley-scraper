AB  - Summary This chapter discusses various urinary and renal diseases in small animals. Disorders of the upper and lower urinary tract can produce nonspecific clinical signs including anorexia, gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, and weight loss. Several signs can be helpful in localizing disorders, and the discussed terminology is useful in describing clinical signs associated with disorders of the urinary tract. Patients with urinary tract disorders, and more specifically renal diseases, can have impaired metabolism and excretion abilities, putting them an increased risk for adverse events when administered certain medications and anesthetics. Patients with urinary tract diseases often require the administration of anesthesia for diagnostic and treatment procedures, making it important for nursing staff to understand how anesthetics can affect the renal patient. Abdominal ultrasound is a useful tool for identifying structural problems of the upper and lower urinary tract including stones, tumors, changes in kidney architecture such as pyelectasia, and evaluating for the presence of obstructions.

AB  - The nervous control of expiratory muscles is less well understood than that of the inspiratory muscles, particularly in the rat. The patterns of respiratory discharges in adult rats were therefore investigated for the muscles of the caudal intercostal spaces, with hypercapnia and under either anaesthesia or decerebration. With neuromuscular blockade and artificial ventilation, efferent discharges were present for both inspiration and expiration in both external and internal intercostal nerves. This was also the case for proximal internal intercostal nerve branches that innervate only internal intercostal and subcostalis muscles. If active, this region of muscle in other species is always expiratory. Here, inspiratory bursts were almost always present. The expiratory activity appeared only gradually and intermittently, when the anaesthesia was allowed to lighten or as the pre-decerebration anaesthesia wore off. The intermittent appearance is interpreted as the coupling of a slow medullary expiratory oscillator with a faster inspiratory one. The patterns of nerve discharges, in particular the inspiratory or biphasic activation of the internal and subcostalis layers, were confirmed by observations of equivalent patterns of EMG discharges in spontaneously breathing preparations, using denervation procedures to identify which muscles generated the signals. Some motor units were recruited in both inspiratory and expiratory bursts. These patterns of activity have not previously been described and have implications both for the functional role of multiple respiratory oscillators in the adult and for the mechanical actions of the muscles of the caudal intercostal spaces, including subcostalis, which is a partly bisegmental muscle.

AB  - Abstract Intra-articular (IA) corticosteroid injections are a common approach in the management of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The effectiveness of injections and particular injection products is often discussed and debated in clinical arenas. The following therapeutic review examines the evidence for intra-articular methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) injections in the management of OA knee. A review of research evidence, published guidelines and clinical literature was undertaken following an electronic database and relevant literature search. The review found that there is limited evidence which indicates that a single dose intra-articular MPA injection can provide short to medium term benefits for pain, with less evidence for beneficial effects on function or stiffness. There is heterogeneity across studies and until recently, most studies had only short to medium term follow-up periods, thus limiting the evidence available on longer term benefit. There was also evidence indicating equivalent overall efficacy of MPA to that of other corticosteroid products. Most guideline recommendations concerning IA injections for OA knee have drawn on evidence from pooled data for several corticosteroid products. The review also found there was limited reporting of the incidence of adverse events in most studies. Overall, MPA shows efficacy for symptom relief in OA knee. At an individual management level, evidence for a limited duration of effect needs consideration in injections decisions. Furthermore, consensus across clinical guidelines suggests that the management of OA knee should be individualized to a person's clinical history, degree of disability, risk factors, quality of life and personal preferences, whereby injecting involves a shared decision and forms part of a multimodal approach.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this chapter is to consider how a developmental psychopathology perspective can advance our understanding of bipolar disorder. In this chapter we start by discussing the phenomenology of the disorder. As this is a field in which scientific controversies abound, this section begins by placing bipolar disorder in a historical context. We consider the origins of current clinical diagnostic approaches and evaluate newly emerging empirical approaches that utilize dimensions of symptoms, behaviors, and neurobiological indexes. We then review prominent etiological theories of the illness, including work on environmental stressors and hazards as well as behavioral and genetic approaches. We highlight some of the most promising theories that account for both environmental and biological mechanisms of bipolar disorder. Additionally, because bipolar disorder can be considered a neurodevelopmental disorder, biological mechanisms are also discussed in the context of brain imaging research. We conclude the chapter with suggestions for translational research by considering how these developmental and neurodevelopmental models can inform intervention science and help identify promising new directions for future research.
