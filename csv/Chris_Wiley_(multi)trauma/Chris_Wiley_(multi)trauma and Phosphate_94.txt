AB  - Summary This chapter discusses various urinary and renal diseases in small animals. Disorders of the upper and lower urinary tract can produce nonspecific clinical signs including anorexia, gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, and weight loss. Several signs can be helpful in localizing disorders, and the discussed terminology is useful in describing clinical signs associated with disorders of the urinary tract. Patients with urinary tract disorders, and more specifically renal diseases, can have impaired metabolism and excretion abilities, putting them an increased risk for adverse events when administered certain medications and anesthetics. Patients with urinary tract diseases often require the administration of anesthesia for diagnostic and treatment procedures, making it important for nursing staff to understand how anesthetics can affect the renal patient. Abdominal ultrasound is a useful tool for identifying structural problems of the upper and lower urinary tract including stones, tumors, changes in kidney architecture such as pyelectasia, and evaluating for the presence of obstructions.

AB  - Oral Diseases (2011) 17, 241?251 The rapid advancement in basic biology knowledge, especially in the stem cell field, has created new opportunities to develop biomaterials capable of orchestrating the behavior of transplanted and host cells. Based on our current understanding of cellular differentiation, a conceptual framework for the use of materials to program cells in situ is presented, namely a domino vs a switchboard model, to highlight the use of single vs multiple cues in a controlled manner to modulate biological processes. Further, specific design principles of material systems to present soluble and insoluble cues that are capable of recruiting, programming and deploying host cells for various applications are presented. The evolution of biomaterials from simple inert substances used to fill defects, to the recent development of sophisticated material systems capable of programming cells in situ is providing a platform to translate our understanding of basic biological mechanisms to clinical care.

AB  - Abstract Intra-articular (IA) corticosteroid injections are a common approach in the management of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The effectiveness of injections and particular injection products is often discussed and debated in clinical arenas. The following therapeutic review examines the evidence for intra-articular methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) injections in the management of OA knee. A review of research evidence, published guidelines and clinical literature was undertaken following an electronic database and relevant literature search. The review found that there is limited evidence which indicates that a single dose intra-articular MPA injection can provide short to medium term benefits for pain, with less evidence for beneficial effects on function or stiffness. There is heterogeneity across studies and until recently, most studies had only short to medium term follow-up periods, thus limiting the evidence available on longer term benefit. There was also evidence indicating equivalent overall efficacy of MPA to that of other corticosteroid products. Most guideline recommendations concerning IA injections for OA knee have drawn on evidence from pooled data for several corticosteroid products. The review also found there was limited reporting of the incidence of adverse events in most studies. Overall, MPA shows efficacy for symptom relief in OA knee. At an individual management level, evidence for a limited duration of effect needs consideration in injections decisions. Furthermore, consensus across clinical guidelines suggests that the management of OA knee should be individualized to a person's clinical history, degree of disability, risk factors, quality of life and personal preferences, whereby injecting involves a shared decision and forms part of a multimodal approach.

AB  - ABSTRACT No disease-modifying osteoarthritis (OA) drugs are available to prevent posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Mitochondria (MT) mediate the pathogenesis of many degenerative diseases, and recent evidence indicates that MT dysfunction is a peracute (within minutes to hours) response of cartilage to mechanical injury. The goal of this study was to investigate cardiolipin-targeted mitoprotection as a new strategy to prevent chondrocyte death and cartilage degeneration after injury. Cartilage was harvested from bovine knee joints and subjected to a single, rapid impact injury (24.0?±1.4?MPa, 53.8?±?5.3?GPa/s). Explants were then treated with a mitoprotective peptide, SS-31 (1µM), immediately post-impact, or at 1, 6, or 12?h after injury, and then cultured for up to 7 days. Chondrocyte viability and apoptosis were quantified in situ using confocal microscopy. Cell membrane damage (lactate dehydrogenase activity) and cartilage matrix degradation (glycosaminoglycan loss) were quantified in cartilage-conditioned media. SS-31 treatment at all time points after impact resulted in chondrocyte viability similar to that of un-injured controls. This effect was sustained for up to a week in culture. Further, SS-31 prevented impact-induced chondrocyte apoptosis, cell membrane damage, and cartilage matrix degeneration. Clinical Significance: This study is the first investigation of cardiolipin-targeted mitoprotective therapy in cartilage. These results suggest that even when treatment is delayed by up to 12?h after injury, mitoprotection may be a useful strategy in the prevention of PTOA. ? 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract These studies demonstrate that murine hippocampal slice cultures possess neural-immune elements that show responses parallel to comparable in vivo models of neural-immune activation. Using immunocytochemical techniques, this study characterized the phenotypes of specific glial elements and the expression of the cytokine, interleukin-1 (IL-1?), in the hippocampal dentate gyrus over a period of 10 days in vitro (DIV). Preparation of organotypic slice cultures of neonatal mouse hippocampus produced cellular damage including axotomy of afferent fibers within the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. This form of lesion-induced injury caused activation of neural-immune elements in the slice cultures. Staining with the microglial specific, biotinylated Griffonia simplicifolia B4-isolectin revealed reactive microglia were most prevalent at 2 DIV and decreased in number from 4 to 10 DIV, whereas the initial population of resting microglia at 2 DIV increased approximately four-fold from 4 to 10 DIV. The presence of a round IL-1?-like immunophenotype closely paralleled the temporal and spatial distribution of the reactive form of microglia observed in the dentate gyrus. In addition, between 4 and 10 DIV, some IL-1?-like immunoreactive cells exhibited a stellate-like morphology with numerous branching processes, similar to resting microglia. At 2 DIV, astrocytes showed minimal labeling with antibodies directed against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), while from 4 to 10 DIV, a dramatic hypertrophic astrocytic response occurred, resulting in a gliotic scar forming over the entire dentate gyrus. We conclude that neural-immune activation in the hippocampal organotypic slice culture preparation closely parallels similar responses observed in vivo and thus slice cultures represent an excellent model for further studies of neural-immune interactions resulting from lesion-induced injury in the central nervous system.

AB  - Abstract Aims Increased apoptotic activity in pelvic tissues may contribute to development of pelvic floor disorders. We evaluated expression of apoptotic factors (Bcl-2 family) in vaginal tissues from women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and how these factors correlate with severity of prolapse. Methods mRNA and protein expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic factors in vaginal tissues from subjects and controls were determined by real-time PCR and Western blot. Severity of prolapse was staged using POP-Q criteria. Results Differential expression of Bcl-2 family factors was observed in protein rather than in gene expression. During the secretory phase, the anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-xl) and pro-apoptotic protein (Bax) were upregulated in controls compared to cases (P?<?0.05). The ratios of Bcl-2/Bax and Bcl-2/Bad, which determine cellular sensitivity to induction of apoptosis, were higher in controls versus cases. Higher ratios indicate reduced cellular sensitivity to apoptosis. Protein expression of Bax and Bad was higher in women with severe compared to mild prolapse (P?<?0.05). Conclusion Increased expression of Bad, Bax, and decreased ratios of Bcl-2/Bax, Bcl-2/Bad suggest increased apoptotic activity or sensitivity to induction of apoptosis in vaginal tissues of women with POP.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective This study investigated the effects of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) transplantation combined with low dose ultrashortwave (USW) radiation on functional recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (n?=?64) were randomly divided into five groups: sham-operated, as well as control, USW, BMSCs, and BMSCs?+?USW that were subjected to spinal cord contusion. BMSCs were transplanted into rats in the BMSCs and BMSCs+USW groups, while those in the USW and BMSCs?+?USW were exposed to radiation; Basso?Beattie?Bresnahan (BBB) tests were performed before the operation and at 1-week intervals after SCI for 7 weeks. 7 weeks later, animals were assessed footprint pattern, motor evoked potential (MEP), histological features, and expression of the ED1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), markers of activated macrophages and astrocytes, respectively, in the lesion area. BBB scores were higher in the BMSCs?+?USW than in the BMSCs and control groups. The USW and BMSCs?+?USW groups had improved coordination compared to the BMSCs and control groups (P?<?0.01 and P?<?0.001, respectively, vs. control). BMSCs?+?USW rats had a lower ratio of lesion/cavity to spinal cord area than the other injured rats, and also had expression of GFAP in transplanted BMSCs. All treatment groups had lower ED1 expression and MEP latency than the controls (P?<?0.01 and P?<?0.001, respectively). The results indicate that BMSCs transplantation combined with USW radiation is more effective than either treatment alone in promoting functional recovery after SCI, possibly due to concomitant suppression of inflammation and spinal cord repair.

AB  - Summary Platelet transfusions can be essential to the management of dogs with severe thrombocytopenia or thrombopathia experiencing uncontrolled or life-threatening bleeding. While human blood banks maintain platelet concentrate (PC) in their inventories, fresh whole blood (FWB) is the only readily available platelet-containing product in many veterinary practices. Although there are few clinical indications for FWB, it might be appropriate in the management of dogs and cats with anemia and bleeding due to thrombocytopenia or thrombopathia or in those requiring massive transfusion. An alternative approach to preparation of PC from FWB is plateletpheresis. Fresh platelet products have a short shelf life. During the past several decades, platelet cryopreservation has been extensively investigated as a means to provide long-term storage and immediate availability of platelet products for transfusion. Due to the time limitation on storage of fresh PC and the cumbersome process of platelet cryopreservation, there has been considerable interest in the development of lyophilized platelet products.
