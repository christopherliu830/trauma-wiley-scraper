AB  - Abstract? The stereoselectivity of binding of four ?-blockers, pindolol, propranolol, oxprenolol and acebutolol, to purified rat α1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) was examined using equilibrium dialysis. Pindolol and propranolol were bound stereoselectively to AAG, whereas binding of oxprenolol was non-stereospecific. Neither of the enantiomers of acebutolol bound to either AAG or any other plasma protein. The affinity of (+)-pindolol was 25 times that of (?)-pindolol, as determined in a single enantiomer experiment. Both enantiomers of propranolol demonstrated two classes of binding sites in AAG, the total binding for the high affinity site for (+)-propranolol being double that of (?)-propranolol, which could explain the higher binding of the (+)-enantiomer in racemate experiments. These results further showed that stereoselective binding to a rat AAG is not a property common to all ?-blockers.

AB  - Summary Platelet transfusions can be essential to the management of dogs with severe thrombocytopenia or thrombopathia experiencing uncontrolled or life-threatening bleeding. While human blood banks maintain platelet concentrate (PC) in their inventories, fresh whole blood (FWB) is the only readily available platelet-containing product in many veterinary practices. Although there are few clinical indications for FWB, it might be appropriate in the management of dogs and cats with anemia and bleeding due to thrombocytopenia or thrombopathia or in those requiring massive transfusion. An alternative approach to preparation of PC from FWB is plateletpheresis. Fresh platelet products have a short shelf life. During the past several decades, platelet cryopreservation has been extensively investigated as a means to provide long-term storage and immediate availability of platelet products for transfusion. Due to the time limitation on storage of fresh PC and the cumbersome process of platelet cryopreservation, there has been considerable interest in the development of lyophilized platelet products.

AB  - The mechanisms which lead to secondary brain damage following transient ischaemia are incompletely defined. As discussed in this hypothesis article, the events which lead to such damage could encompass (a) a perturbed membrane handling of calcium, leading to a slow, gradual increase in the free cytosolic calcium concentration (Ca2+i), with subsequent calcium overload of mitochondria, (b) a sustained reduction of protein synthesis which, in the long run, deprives cells of enzymes or trophic factors essential to their survival, or (c) the initiation of an inherent program for cell death. Results obtained in ischaemia of brief to intermediate duration demonstrate that the ultimate cell death is heralded by a reduction in the respiratory capacity of isolated mitochondria. However, the results fail to demonstrate whether or not such a reduction precedes deterioration of the bioenergetic state which then precipitates cell death. Cyclosporin A (CsA) has recently been shown to dramatically improve the delayed CA1 damage following transient forebrain ischaemia. Since CsA is known to block a deleterious permeability transition (PT) in mitochondria from several tissues in response to calcium accumulation and oxidative stress, the results on CsA effects in forebrain ischaemia support a mitochondrial origin for the delayed cell death. Furthermore, comparisons with the effects of CsA and α-phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN) in thymocytes and other cells undergoing programmed cell death suggest that delayed neuronal damage occurs by a sequence of events akin to those leading to apoptotic cell death. However, whether cell death is apoptotic or necrotic may depend on the severity of the insult (and its duration). We speculate that the initial ischaemic transient leads to gradual mitochondrial calcium overload, the latter triggering a PT, and apoptotic or necrotic cell death. Since similar results have been obtained in normoglycaemic animals subjected to ischaemia of intermediate duration, and in animals with preischaemic hyperglycaemia, it seems likely that both increased ischaemia duration and hyperglycaemia accelerate damage to mitochondria in the reperfusion period. Recent results obtained in transient focal ischaemia of 2 h duration demonstrate that the free radical spin trap PBN reduces infarct size, even when given 1 or 3 h after the start of reperfusion, thus providing a second window of therapeutic possibility. A major effect of the drug is exerted on the recovery of energy metabolism of the tissue since it reduces a secondary deterioration in the bioenergetic state, occurring after 2?4 h of reperfusion. At least in part, the spin trap may exert its effect by reducing microvascular dysfunction caused by oedema and to adhesion of polymorphonuclear (PMN) leucocytes, which give rise to an inflammatory response mediated by cytokines, lipid mediators, or free radicals. This contention is supported by the reduction in focal ischaemic damage by antibodies to adhesion molecules for PMNs. However, it has now been found that the secondary deterioration of the bioenergetic state of core and penumbral tissues are mirrored by corresponding changes in the respiratory functions of isolated mitochondria, suggesting that, also in this type of ischaemia, the mitochondria suffer secondary damage. It is conceivable that a significant fraction of malfunctioning mitochondria emanate from microvascular tissue, explaining why antibodies to adhesion molecules mitigate the ischaemic lesions.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis To optimize decellularization of porcine vocal folds (VF) and quantify human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) interactions with this matrix to provide a foundation for regenerative approaches to VF repair. Study Design and Methods Vocal folds were dissected from porcine larynges and three decellularization protocols were compared, each consisting of washes and mechanical agitations with different combinations of reagents. DNA content was analyzed via Quant-iT Picogreen assay and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Bone marrow-derived MSCs were then seeded onto the decellularized VF matrices. Morphology, metabolic activity, DNA content, and gene expression were assessed using LIVE/DEAD Cell Viability, alamarBlue Cell Viability Assay, Quant-iT Picogreen assay, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Results The most successful decellularization protocol removed 95% DNA content within 1 day, compared to several days required for previously described protocols. Histology confirmed the retention of extracellular matrix (ECM) and its components, including glycosaminoglycans, collagen, and fibrin, while void of nuclear/cellular content. Decellularized scaffolds were then seeded with BM-MSCs. Similar DNA quantities were observed after 24 hours of seeding within the VF-ECM scaffold when compared to cells on tissue culture plastic (TCP). LIVE/DEAD staining of the seeded VF-ECM confirmed excellent cell viability, and the metabolic activity of BM-MSCs increased significantly on VF-ECM compared to TCP. Endoglin gene expression decreased, suggestive of differentiation. Conclusion Porcine VFs can be efficiently decellularized within 5 hours using a combination of sodium deoxycholate and peracetic acid. Decellularized VF-ECM supported attachment and growth of human BM-MSCs, with evidence of differentiation. Level of Evidence N/A Laryngoscope, 126:928?935, 2016

AB  - 1 Anu Muraja-Murro, 1 Ari Pääkkönen, 2 Leena Jutila, 2 Reetta Kälviäinen, 3 Arto Immonen, 1 Sara Määttä, and 1 Esa Mervaala ( 1 Clinical Neurophysiology, Kuopio University Hospital, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland ; 2 Neurology, Kuopio University Hospital, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland ; and 3 Neurosurgery, Kuopio University Hospital, University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland ) Rationale: Mismatch-negativity (MMN) is an auditory event-related potential (ERP) produced by a deviant stimuli that occurs infrequenty among standard stimuli. MMN is thought to reflect the activation of an automatic change-detector system that compares new auditory input with a short-term memory trace generated by the previous auditory stimuli. MMN in human has been demonstrated from several cortical sites, but not to our knowledge from hippocampus or amygdala. This is surprising, given that these limbic structures are so essential for learning and memory functions. We could obtain MMN from these temporomesial structures using intracranial electrodes in adult patients undergoing presurgical evaluation for epilepsy surgery. Methods: 4 adults with intractable temporal lobe seizures (age 32?48 years) had each 2?4 stereotactically implanted 6-contact depth-electrodes at amygdalo-hippocampal complex. The electrodes were implanted via lateral approach and their exact anatomical localizations were confirmed by MRI and CT in situ. After the post hoc anatomical localization of the depth-electrodes, the presence of MMN could be studied from 6 hippocampi and 5 amygdalas (i.e., the electrode tips were exactly within amygdalo-hippocampal complex). The most mesial depth-electrode contacts were chosen for the MMN analysis with the MMN latency range of 120?250 ms, as well as with the P300 range of 250?500 ms. We analyzed possible statistically significant differences between the ERPs to deviant and standard tones. Results: A definite MMN within 120?250 ms latency range could be recorded from 4/6 hippocampi and 3/5 amygdalas. MMN was also detected within 250?500 ms latency range in 3/6 hippocampi and 2/5 amygdalas, respectively. In only one patient the hippocampal MMN resembled typical scalp-recorded MMN. In all, the MMN decreased from the deepest contacts towards the cortex, suggesting a local maximum of MMN at the amygdalo-hippocampal complex. Conclusions: Our data implicates that a local and early (120?500 ms post-stimuli) automatic electrophysiological change-detector system exists within the amygdalo-hippocampal complex. This data is the first to demonstrate that also these temporomesial structures are activated and involved in mismatch detection, and is in line with recent sensory mismatch fMRI studies. Other sensory stimuli might also produce MMN in the same structures, possibly thus revealing a common function for hippocampus and amygdala in early sensory stimulus detection. 1 Tobias Loddenkemper, 2 Gabriel Moeddel, 1 Elia M. Pestana, 1 Deepak K. Lachhwani, 1 Ajay Gupta, 1 Prakash Kotagal, and 1 Elaine Wyllie ( 1 Department of Epilepsy and Sleep Disorder, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ; and 2 Department of Neurology, Universitaetsklinikum Muenster, Muenster, Westfalen, Germany ) Rationale: The intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT) is part of the presurgical workup of patients scheduled for epilepsy surgery to determine language and memory lateralization. Most information on results and complications are derived from adults. Little is known about children undergoing IAT. Difficulties arise from anxiety, need for barbiturate dosage adjustment, and impaired baseline memory in children with mental retardation [4]. The goal of this study was 1) to describe language lateralization in children with epilepsy and 2) to outline complications during IAT. Methods: 126 consecutive pediatric IAT performed at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation during a seven year period were reviewed. Results: 44 patients were age 5?12 years, 82 were age 13?18. 102 were right-handed. Amobarbital (n = 96, average dose: 100 +- 25 mg) or Methohexital (n = 30, average dose 5 +- 1 mg) was injected into the left (n = 18), right (n = 13), or both (n = 95) ICA. Language was localized in 95 patients (75.4%): 75 [78.9%] were left, 6 [6.3%] were right, 14 [14.7%] bilateral language dominant. Neurological complications included prolonged lethargy impairing language and memory evaluation in 4 patients. Four children had a seizure after injection. Additionally, valid data could not be obtained due to fear or agitation in three children age 5?9 years. No lasting neurological deficits were seen. General complications included shortness of breath after contrast injection in one boy. One girl presented with fever of 38.5 C the night after the procedure complaining of groin pain. No other major complications were seen. Conclusions: This is one of the largest pediatric IAT series studied so far. The data on language lateralization agree with those previously reported [1, 2, 3]. The IAT in children is an invasive test with a potential for complications, as in adults, occuring in 10 out of 126 patients [7.9%]. Our series highlights the need for refinement and further development of novel methods to establish language lateralization in children during the evaluation for epilepsy surgery.

Isojärvi ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland ; and 2 Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland ) Rationale: To prospectively evaluate changes in interictal heart rate (HR) variability in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) after 4 years follow-up. Methods: A 24-hour ECG recording was obtained at baseline and four years after first recording in 18 patients with refractory TLE, 18 patients with well controlled TLE, and once in 36 healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects. Time and frequency domain measures, along with fractal and complexity measures of HR variability, were analysed from the ECG recordings. Results: At baseline most of the measures showed decreased HR variability in the TLE patients compared to control subjects. After four years follow-up, most of the HR variability measures were further decreased in patients with TLE, and the RR interval (p = 0.015), the Poincaré component SD2 (p < 0.002), and ApEn (p = 0.000) value decreases from the baseline were statistically significant. Conclusions: TLE was associated with reduced HR variability at the baseline of the study. Further decrease in HR variability in patients with TLE was observed after four-year follow-up 1 Manjari Tripathi, 1 Shalini Mukherjee, 1 K.K. Deepak, and 1 Padma Vasantha ( 1 Department of Neurology, All India Institue of Medical Science, New Delhi, Delhi, India; Department of Physiology, All India Institue of Medical Science, New Delhi, Delhi, India; and Department of Physiology, All India Institue of Medical Science, New Delhi, Delhi, India ) Rationale: Changes in cardiovascular tone is noted in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy patients. The dysfunction of sympathetic and/or parasympathetic activity is a potential cause of sudden unexpected death in epileptic patients. The present study was aimed at finding out the effect of epilepsy surgery on autonomic functions in intractable epileptic patients. Methods: 27 patients of mean age 27.3 +/?10.8 who were intractable for over two years or more and selected for surgery. They underwent a battery of tests that assessed their autonomic reactivity. Baseline autonomic activity (tone) was also measured by Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. The patients underwent the same tests again 3 months later. Results: The indices of Deep Breathing test (DBT)- before and after surgery, i.e. E:I ratio (1.27 +/?0.13 vs. 1.4 +/? 0.1) and delta changes in heart rate (20.5 +/? 8.75 vs. 23.0 +/? 1.3) show an increase, though not significant, in parasympathetic reactivity after surgery. No changes were observed in the Valsalva Maneuver or in the 30:15 ratio in the Head Up Tilt test (HUT). The rise in Diastolic BP in Hand Grip Test (28.0 +/? 7.0 vs. 16.0 +/? 10.4) was significantly less after surgery. The reactivity tests show that there may be a trend towards increase in parasympathetic and decrease in sympathetic reactivity after surgery. Among the parameters in the HRV which denote the autonomic tone, most of the time domain measures between pre and post surgery patients, i.e. SENN (1.4 +/? 0.4 vs. 1.6 +/? 1.2), SDSD (20.3 +/? 8.8 vs. 25 +/? 21.6), RMSSD (20.3 +/? 8.8 vs. 25 +/? 21.6), NN50 (0.55 +/? 3.3 vs. 5 +/? 26.1), pNN50 (0.4 +/? 0.1 vs. 0.51 +/? 0.2) showed an increase in values post surgery, denoting an increase in parasympathetic tone. In the frequency domain measures, LF (nu) and% LF denote the sympathetic tone; LF (nu) ((45.5 +/? 19.6 vs. 34 +/? 14.6) showed a significant decrease after surgery and%LF (20.8 +/? 13.1 vs. 22.2 +/? 8.8) was also reduced, thereby showing a decrease in sympathetic tone. HF (nu) and% HF denote parasympathetic tone and HF (nu) showed an increase (48.6 +/? 21.5 vs. 57.2 +/? 22.8), while%HF (36.5 +/? 21.8 vs. 43.2 +/? 16.9) showed a significant increase after surgery, denoting an increase in parasympathetic tone after surgery. The LF/HF ratios, which show the sympathovagal balance, also showed a significant decrease (1.1 +/? 1.1 vs. 0.63 +/? 0.4) after surgery. Two patients who had abnormal tone before surgery showed normalization after surgery. Conclusions: The present study shows that the autonomic functions are modulated after surgery; exhibiting a decrease in sympathetic reactivity and increase in parasympathetic reactivity. An increase in parasympathetic tone and a significant decrease in sympathetic tone is also noted after surgery.

AB  - Abstract The critical role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in mediating inflammatory lung injury in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been raised recently. The present study has identified enhanced MIF protein expression in alveolar capillary endothelium and infiltrating macrophages in lung tissues from ARDS patients. The possibility that MIF up-regulates its synthesis in an autocrine fashion in ARDS was tested using cultured endothelial cells stimulated with MIF and a murine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury. MIF induced significant MIF and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α synthesis in cultured endothelial cells and the effect was blocked by neutralizing anti-MIF antibody. A similar blocking effect was observed when MIF-stimulated endothelial cells were pretreated with neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibody or glucocorticoid, supporting the notion that MIF induced TNF-α production via an amplifying pro-inflammatory loop. Treatment with anti-MIF or glucocorticoid effectively attenuated pulmonary pathology and the synthesis of MIF or TNF-α in mice with LPS-induced acute lung injury. Mildly augmented expression of aquaporin 1 (AQP1) was also detected in alveolar capillary endothelium in ARDS. In vitro studies revealed that both MIF and TNF-α induced a small increase of AQP1 synthesis in cultured endothelial cells. These findings suggest that MIF plays a crucial pathological role leading to alveolar inflammation in ARDS. Anti-MIF and early glucocorticoid therapy may represent a novel therapeutic approach for reducing alveolar inflammation in ARDS. Copyright ? 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Current mechanical and chemotherapeutic approaches to oral hygiene aim to modify the oral microflora to promote healthy periodontal and dental tissues. Current oral hygiene measures, appropriately used and in conjunction with regular professional care, are capable of virtually preventing caries and most periodontal disease and maintaining oral health. Toothbrushing and flossing are most commonly used, although interdental brushes and wooden sticks can offer advantages in periodontally involved dentitions. Chewing sugar-free gums as a salivary stimulant is a promising caries-preventive measure. Despite new products and design modifications, mechanical measures require manual dexterity and cognitive ability. Chemotherapeutic supplementation of mechanical measures using dentifrices, mouthrinses, gels and chewing gums as delivery vehicles can improve oral hygiene. The list includes anticalculus, antibacterial and cariostatic agents. For the population at large to make effective use of these oral hygiene measures, oral hygiene promotion needs to be implemented. Considerations include the role of parents, school and the media for children and the workplace, social environments, nursing homes and trained carers for adults and the elderly. Community oral hygiene promotion must attempt to maximise opportunities for oral health for all and reduce inequalities by removing financial and other barriers. Oral health approaches should be tailored to lifestyles and abilities of children, adults and the elderly in order to enable them to make decisions to improve personal oral hygiene and oral health.

AB  - Abstract Chitin films possessing increased flexibility, softness, transparency, and conformability have been prepared. These attributes enable the potential application of chitin films as occlusive, semipermeable film wound dressings similar to commercial products such as Opsite?. The chitin films are generally nonabsorbent, exhibiting a total weight gain of only up to 120?160% in physiological fluid. Dry chitin films transpire water vapor at a rate of about 600 g/m2/24 h, similar to commercial polyurethane-based film dressings, but rises to 2400 g/m2/24 h, when wet, which is higher than the water vapor transmission rate of intact skin. The chitin films are nontoxic to human skin fibroblasts, maintaining 70?80% cell viability. Wound studies using a rat model showed no signs of allergenicity or the high inflammatory response associated with biodegradable biomaterials. The chitin films displayed accelerated wound-healing properties. Based on histological examination, wound sites dressed with the chitin films stabilized and healed faster, and appeared stronger than those dressed with Opsite? and gauze dressings after 7 days of healing. ? 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
