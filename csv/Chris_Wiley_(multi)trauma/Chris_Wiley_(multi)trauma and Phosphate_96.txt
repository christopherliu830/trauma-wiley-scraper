AB  - Abstract In 1973, Singleton and Merten described two females with abnormal dentition, unique radiographic changes especially of the hands, and severe calcification and intimal weakening of the aortic arch and valve. Since then three additional cases with similar features have been reported and the diagnosis was suggested in another three individuals. We present an update of one case and the detailed clinical phenotype of six other cases with Singleton?Merten syndrome. The occurrence of the disorder in six members of two families and vertical male-to-male transmission indicate an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Variability in phenotype, also within a single family, is significant. Core manifestations are marked aortic calcification, dental anomalies (delayed eruption and immature root formation of primarily the anterior permanent teeth, and early loss of permanent teeth due to short roots, acute root resorption, high caries, and aggressive alveolar bone loss), osteopenia and acro-osteolysis, and to a lesser extend also glaucoma, psoriasis, muscle weakness, and joint laxity. Additional clinical characteristics described here include particular facial characteristics (high anterior hairline, broad forehead, smooth philtrum, thin upper vermillion) and abnormal joint and muscle ligaments. The cause and pathogenesis of this syndrome remain unknown. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Schiemann Delgado ( 1 Montreal Neurological Hospital  and 2 Clinical, UCB SA, Pharma Sector, Braine l'Alleud, Belgium ) Rationale: The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of levetiracetam (LEV) 3000 mg/d (b.i.d.) in patients with idiopathic generalised epilepsy experiencing myoclonic seizures. Methods: In this multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, patients who were poorly controlled on one antiepileptic drug (AED) were randomised 1:1, LEV versus placebo. To be eligible, patients had to experience at least 8 days with myoclonic seizures during the 8-week prospective baseline. The 16-week treatment period was composed of a 4-week titration period followed by a 12-week stable dose evaluation period. Seizures were reported by the patients on diaries, myoclonic seizures and absence seizures being reported as days with seizures, while primary generalised tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures were counted individually. The primary efficacy endpoint was the responder rate (≥50% reduction in days with myoclonic seizures during the treatment period versus baseline). Results: 122 patients, aged 12?65 years, 113 with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and 9 with juvenile absence epilepsy, were randomised. 60 LEV patients and 60 placebo patients were evaluable for efficacy and safety. The responder rate for myoclonic seizures was 58.3% with LEV versus 23.3% with placebo (p = 0.0002). As a secondary analysis, for all seizure types, the median difference between groups in the percent reduction from baseline was obtained and compared using the Wilcoxon Mann Whitney test. The median difference in percent reduction in seizure days per week for all seizure types was 38.08 (LEV, n = 60; placebo, n = 60; p < 0.0001); for myoclonic seizures, it was 36.55 (LEV, n = 60; placebo, n = 60; p < 0.0001); and for absence seizures, it was 0 (LEV, n = 19; placebo, n = 17; p = not significant). The median difference in percent reduction in seizure frequency per week for PGTC seizures was 30.35 (LEV, n = 15; placebo, n = 18; p = not significant). LEV also demonstrated a good tolerability profile. Conclusions: LEV is highly efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of refractory patients with idiopathic generalised epilepsy. LEV decreases the number of days with myoclonic seizures in a statistically and clinically significant manner. No significant difference was observed for absence and PGTC seizures.

Duron ( 1 Centro de Salud de Opoa, Secretary of Health, Copan, Honduras ; and 2 Neurology Training Program, National Autonomous University of Honduras, Tegucigalpa, Honduras ) Rationale: Injuries associated to epileptic seizures are increasingly recognized in Honduras, where epilepsy is highly prevalent. Our goal was to determine the profile and outcome of epilepsy patients who suffer burns associated to seizures. Methods: A prospective study was performed at the Surgery Services in a rural hospital of West Honduras (Copan City) and the University Hospital at Tegucigalpa City from January 2002 to March of 2005. Demographic data, treatment status and characteristics of burns were evaluated. Results: During the study period, 24 patients with epilepsy were admitted because of burns (71% women and 29% men). The average age was 33 years old (range 11?64). Most burns occurred with hot liquids; 71% of them were grade II and 29% were grade III. All patients reported tonic-clonic seizures during the accident; most were partial secondarily generalized seizures. Sixty-two percent of patients were not under antiepileptic treatment because of discipline and financial issues and 38% were taking treatment but had uncontrolled seizures. There were no fatal cases during the admission time. All patients had aesthetic consequences. Conclusions: This study shows the impact of uncontrolled epileptic seizures in Honduras. Patients suffer these kind of accidents because of non-compliance and problems accessing antiepileptic treatments. There is need for strategies to prevent these and other kinds of accidents in patients with epilepsy in Honduras. 1 Jacci L. Bainbridge ( 1 Neurology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO ) Rationale: In this study data relating to seizure count/frequency were obtained from subjects switched from immediate-release carbamazepine (IR-CBZ) to an equal total daily dose of Carbatrol? extended-release capsules (CBZ-ERC) at a minimum of 400 mg/d. Methods: At baseline, eligible and enrolled subjects were switched from their current IR-CBZ product to an equal total daily dose of CBZ-ERC. Grounds for exclusion from this multicenter study included: known history of generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus or epilepsy syndromes that may potentially worsen with carbamazepine treatment, progressive neurological disorder, receiving more than 1 additional antiepileptic drug or any type of neuroleptic drug, or CBZ-ERC treatment within 90 days of study screening. Data from 453 patients with epilepsy were collected. Seizure count assessment via seizure diary was performed at baseline (month 0), month 2, and endpoint, while assessment of seizure count at months 1 and 3 were communicated by telephone. Results: Overall mean monthly seizure count (all patients) was significantly decreased both at month 3 and at end point when compared to baseline (P= .05). Conclusions: Monthly seizure count was significantly reduced in patients switched from IR-CBZ to CBZ-ERC at comparable doses. These data support CBZ-ERC as an effective formulation to deliver carbamazepine to the patient with epilepsy. Carbatrol is registered in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. (Supported by Shire.) 1 Steffen Baltes, 1 Heidrun Potschka, and 1 Wolfgang Löscher ( 1 Department of Pharmacology,Toxicology, and Pharmacy, University of Veterinary Medicine, Hannover, Germany ) Rationale: The overexpression of multidrug transporters (MDTs) in the blood-brain barrier (BBB), particularly of P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs, ABCC), is discussed to be involved in pharmacoresistance to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). It has been demonstrated that this overexpression is correlated with seizure severity and duration. This MDT overexpression may hamper a successful treatment of status epilepticus (SE). Our previous studies revealed that the brain access of several AEDs (e.g. phenytoin and phenobarbital) may be limited by MDTs. Other studies indicate that MRPs are involved in the efflux of valproic acid (VPA) at the BBB. However, VPA is known to be often efficacious in treatment of patients with SE resistant to benzodiazepines or phenytoin. As well as for SE as with regard to chronic treatment of epilepsy, the aim of the study presented here was to investigate whether P-gp or in particular MRP2 is involved in VPA transport at the BBB. Methods: We performed in vitro transport assays with cell lines overexpressing P-gp or MRP2, respectively, and we performed brain microdialysis experiments in rats applying two strategies to demonstrate MDT function. Verapamil and probenecid were used to inhibit MDTs in normal rats. Furthermore brain access of VPA was compared between mutant rats lacking MRP2 and wildtype rats of the background strain. Results: No significant in vitro transport of VPA nor any significant impact of MDTs on extracellular brain levels in rats could be found. VPA was the first AED we investigated so far passing this variety of tests without any indication of transport by P-gp or MRP2. Conclusions: The lack of P-gp and MRP2 to limit the brain access of VPA would provide an explanation for the efficacy of VPA especially in SE patients that are resistant to other AEDs. Currently, we investigate a potential impact of MDTs on intracellular VPA brain concentration.

The efficacy and safety of rufinamide (800 mg/d) as adjunctive therapy was evaluated for patients with inadequately controlled primary generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures. Methods: This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of rufinamide (initiated and maintained at 800 mg/d, BID) consisted of a 56-day baseline phase and a 140-day double-blind phase. The study was open to patients ≥4 years of age with a diagnosis of inadequately controlled primary GTC seizures who were treated with 1 or 2 concomitant, fixed-dosage AEDs. To be randomized, patients had to have experienced at least 3 GTC seizures during the baseline phase, with at least 1 occurrence during each 28-day baseline period. The primary efficacy end point was the percent change from baseline in GTC seizure frequency per 28 days. Adverse events (AEs) and laboratory measures for patients receiving any amount of study drug were used to assess safety. Results: A total of 153 patients were randomized and received at least one dose of study drug: rufinamide, n = 78; placebo, n = 75. Mean age of treated patients was 29.3 years (range, 4?63 y) and the median number of GTC seizures per 28 days during baseline was 3.5 (range, 1.5?84) and 4.0 (range, 1.5?74) for the rufinamide and placebo groups, respectively. The primary efficacy variable did not show a significant difference between rufinamide (median reduction, 36.4%) and placebo (25.6%; p = 0.633). Sixty-four patients (82.1%) in the rufinamide group and 61 placebo patients (81.3%) experienced at least 1 AE. Nonfatal serious AEs were reported by 7 rufinamide-treated and 4 placebo patients, but none were considered related to the study drug. Three patients in each treatment group discontinued due to AEs and 1 placebo patient died. Adverse events (reported by ≥10% of patients) in the rufinamide group versus placebo were headache (21.8% vs 22.7%), somnolence (16.7% vs 13.3%), nausea (16.7% vs 8.0%), dizziness (12.8% vs 10.7%), and vomiting (10.3% vs 6.7%). No treatment-emergent and clinically relevant alterations were seen in laboratory parameters. Conclusions: A greater median reduction in GTC seizure frequency was seen in rufinamide-treated patients compared to those receiving placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant. Safety assessments were comparable between treatment groups.

(lamotrigine, LTG) is indicated for partial seizures with or without secondarily generalization in children and adults, and for the generalized seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. This abstract reports efficacy, including time to onset, and tolerability results from a study with LTG as adjunctive therapy in patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS). Methods: LTG-naïve patients (≥ 2 years, ≥ 13 kg) with inadequately controlled PGTCS, receiving a stable regimen of 1 or 2 AED(s) and an electroencephalogram (EEG) with evidence of generalized epileptiform discharges or no evidence of interictal expression of partial seizures were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. Patients having ≥ 3 PGTCS over an 8-week Baseline were randomized (1:1) to receive either LTG or placebo (PBO). The treatment period consisted of an Escalation phase (12 weeks for patients 2?12 years, 7 weeks for patients > 12 years) and a Maintenance phase (12 weeks). Results: Of 184 patients enrolled, 117 were randomized and received LTG or PBO. LTG group: n = 58, 50% male, median age = 27 years (range = 2?53), 50% with 1 concurrent AED, most common concurrent AED: valproate = 41%, phenytoin = 31%, topiramate = 21%, median PGTCS during Baseline = 2.4. PBO group: n = 59, 56% male, median age = 25 years (range = 2?55), 59% with 1 concurrent AED, most common concurrent AED: valproate = 47%, phenytoin = 22%, topiramate = 12%, median PGTCS during Baseline = 2.9. In the overall population the median percent decreases from Baseline in PGTCS were 56% and 30% (p = 0.036) 5 weeks after treatment initiation with LTG and PBO, respectively; in patients >12 years, the decreases were 63% and 33% (p = 0.045) 3 weeks after treatment initiation. The median percent decreases from Baseline in PGTCS were 82% and 43% (p = 0.006) during Maintenance, and 66% and 34% (p = 0.006) during the entire treatment phase, for LTG and PBO, respectively. The median PGTCS counts per month were 2.4 and 2.9 during Baseline for LTG and PBO, respectively, 1.0 and 2.3 (p = 0.013) during Escalation, and 0.4 and 1.6 (p = 0.001) during Maintenance, and 0.8 and 2.0 (p = 0.003) during the entire treatment phase. The most common (≥ 5%) drug-related adverse events for LTG and PBO respectively were dizziness: 5% and 2% for LTG and PBO respectively, somnolence: 5% and 2%, and nausea: 5% and 3%. The non-serious rash rate was 3% for both LTG and PBO. No serious rash was reported. Conclusions: The results from this study, combined with the established efficacy and safety of LTG for partial seizures, clearly demonstrate that LTG is a broad spectrum AED which is efficacious and well tolerated in patients with either partial or generalized seizures. (Supported by GlaxoSmithKline.) 1 David Burdette ( 1 Department of Neurology, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI ) Rationale: This open-label study assessed the efficacy and safety of low-dose zonisamide initiated in combination with concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Methods: Patients aged ≥12 years with partial seizures treated with 1 or 2 concomitant AEDs were enrolled in a 4-week screening phase (SP). Patients were required to have ≥1 seizure during the SP to be eligible for the study. Zonisamide was initiated at a dosage of 25 mg/d and increased to a maximum tolerated dosage or 400 mg/d during the titration phase (TP) (Weeks 0?8). Patients then received their maximum tolerated dosage for the maintenance phase (MP) (Weeks 9?12). The primary efficacy measure was seizure frequency per 28 days as recorded in a seizure diary. Secondary efficacy measures were the change in seizure type or duration and in physician and patient global assessments (rated on a 0?100 scale) between Week 0 (baseline) and Week 12. Safety was assessed via reports of adverse events (AEs) and changes in body weight. Results: A total of 243 patients (mean age, 35.7 years; range, 12?85 years) were treated. Median duration of treatment was 84 days (range, 1?162 days); median maximum zonisamide dosage was 400 mg/d (range, 25?800 mg/d). Median seizure frequency decreased by 47.6% from 8.3 (SP) to 4.0 (MP), with 48.5% of patients (95% confidence interval [CI]: 41.4, 55.5) experiencing ≥50% seizure frequency reduction. Median frequencies of simple partial, complex partial, and other seizure types were reduced by 57.1%, 51.0%, and 96.1%, respectively. A ≥50% reduction in frequency of simple partial, complex partial, and other seizure types was observed in 53.2%, 51.0%, and 69.7% of patients, respectively. No change in seizure type or duration was apparent with zonisamide therapy. Patients' global assessment of AED therapy improved significantly from a mean score of 40.7 at baseline to 67.1 (95% CI: 63.1, 70.4) during treatment. Investigator global assessments of AED therapy also improved from a mean of 31.7 at baseline to 64.0 (95% CI: 61.3, 66.8) during treatment. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent AEs (≥10% of patients) included dizziness (17.3%), somnolence (17.3%), headache (14.0%), abnormal thinking (13.2%), asthenia (11.9%), anorexia (11.5%), accidental injury (11.1%), and nausea (10.7%). Thirteen patients (5.3%) experienced serious AEs (SAEs), 4 of whom had SAEs considered to be zonisamide related. Twenty-two patients (9.1%) withdrew from the study for AEs. Mean body weight decreased from baseline by 0.7 kg (95% CI: -1.1, -0.4) and 1.0 kg (95% CI: -1.3, -0.6) in the TP and MP, respectively. Conclusions: This low-dose, slow titration regimen for zonisamide resulted in substantially decreased seizure frequency, and a significant proportion of patients had a ≥50% seizure frequency reduction. Zonisamide was also generally safe and well tolerated. Small but significant decreases in body weight were observed during the study. (Supported by Eisai Inc.) 1 Frances J. Hayes, 2 Paul T. Caldwell, 1 Patrick M. Sluss, 2 Clay R. Warnock, and 2 Jouko I. Isojarvi ( 1 Gynecology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA ; and 2 Neurosciences MDC, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC ) Rationale: To evaluate the impact of initiating therapy with either valproate (VPA) or lamotrigine (LTG) on body weight and serum lipid levels in women with epilepsy (WWE). Methods: Eligibility criteria for this prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter study (LAM30007) included age 13?40 years, regular menstrual cycles; no concurrent hormonal medications; no prior LTG or VPA; and either newly diagnosed [<2 weeks prior antiepileptic drug (AED)] or inadequately controlled epilepsy (only 1 chronic AED≥3 months). Subjects were randomized to VPA or LTG and were treated for up to 12 months. Fasting serum lipid levels and body weight were measured at baseline and every three months during the study. To exclude the confounding effect of puberty on the results, a post-hoc analysis was conducted in women who were >2 years post menarche. An Analysis of Covariance model comparing end of study measurements to screen was used, including the screening measurement and group center as covariates. Results: A total of 363 women (177 LTG, 186 VPA) ages 12 to 40 years were evaluated. The mean weight gain in the VPA group was 2.8 kg (SD = 3.35) and 0.2 (SD = 3.90) kg in the LTG group (p < 0.001). Mean serum triglyceride concentrations increased 8.4 mg/dL (SD = 37.5) in women taking VPA, while they decreased slightly in the LTG group (0.2 mg/dL, SD = 36.3, p = 0.019). The serum total cholesterol levels showed a slight decrease in both treatment groups, but there was a mean decrease of 2.6 mg/dL (SD = 10.3) in serum HDL-cholesterol levels in VPA treated women, whereas a slight increase of 0.6 mg/dL (SD = 9.2) was observed during LTG treatment (p = 0.001). Conclusions: This large, multiethnic, prospective, randomized study indicates that VPA is associated with weight gain and unfavorable changes in serum lipid levels in WWE, whereas LTG does not seem to affect body weight or serum lipid levels. (Supported by GlaxoSmithKline.) 1 Michael P. Charlet ( 1 Neurology, Leonard J. Chabert Medical Center, Houma, LA ) Rationale: Optimizing treatment for patients with epilepsy must take into account more than basic seizure control. The assessment of adverse events (AEs) and tolerability are important goals in this population to balance medication dosage and efficacy. Differences in adverse event profile or severity between immediate-release and extended-release formulations of carbamazepine are not clearly defined. In this study, tolerability and safety data was obtained from subjects switched from immediate-release carbamazepine (IR-CBZ) to an equal total daily dose of Carbatrol? extended-release capsules (CBZ-ERC) at a minimum of 400 mg/d. Methods: At baseline, eligible and enrolled subjects were switched from their current IR-CBZ product to an equal total daily dose of CBZ-ERC. Grounds for exclusion from this multicenter open-label study included: known history of generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus or epilepsy syndromes that may potentially worsen with carbamazepine treatment, progressive neurological disorder, receiving more than 1 additional antiepileptic drug or any type of neuroleptic drug, or CBZ-ERC treatment within 90 days of study screening. Data from 381 patients with epilepsy were collected. Assessments performed at baseline (month 0) and month 3 included adverse event profile (AEP) for adults 18?59 years of age, Hague seizure severity (HASS) and side-effects (HASES) scales for adolescents <18 years of age (filled out by parent or guardian of adolescent study participant), and monitoring of AE occurrence. The AEP is a 19-item questionnaire scored on a scale from 1 (never a problem) to 4 (always or often a problem), and takes into account sedation, dizziness, unsteadiness, concentration difficulty, depression, and double/blurred vision. Results: The AEP (adults) as well as HASES (adolescents) showed significant decreases from baseline to month 3 in overall mean side effect score (P= .0001 and P= .01, respectively). Subscale scores of both questionnaires also showed significant decreases on many variables. HASS showed a decreased total score with a trend toward significance. Most commonly occurring AEs were headache, dizziness, and fatigue. Overall, 78.8% of both patients and parents (of adolescent patients), as well as 86.4% of physicians preferred CBZ-ERC to previous IR-CBZ medications. Patient responses also indicated that compared to 38.7% at baseline (IR-CBZ), 58.6% of patients ?strongly agree? that they rarely skip or miss a dose of their medication. Conclusions: Patients with epilepsy switched from IR-CBZ to ERC-CBZ experienced decreased AE occurrence and severity. While 22.1% of study participants reported at least one AE, only 3.3% discontinued due to AE occurrence, and only 3.9% reported AE occurrence as ?severe.? These data demonstrate the benefits of ERC-CBZ in terms of safety, tolerability, and preference in a clinical trial setting. (Supported by Shire.) 1 Pamela L. Clemens, 1 James C. Cloyd, 2 Robert L. Kriel, and 1 Rory P. Remmel ( 1 Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN ; and 2 Neurology, Hennepin County Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN ) Rationale: Rectal administration of some AEDs is a viable alternative when the oral route is temporarily unavailable. Oxcarbazepine (OXC) is a newer AED that is rapidly converted to a monohydroxy derivative (MHD), the active compound. Our study was designed to characterize the bioavailability and tolerability of OXC suspension (300 mg/5 ml) administered rectally. Methods: This study used a randomized, crossover design in 10 healthy volunteers who were randomized to the order of routes of administration. Subjects fasted the morning of each dose and administered a Fleet's enema before the rectal dose. The rectal dose was mixed with an equal volume of water and administered via a catheter attached to a syringe. A two-week wash-out occurred between doses. Blood was drawn pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours post-dose. The first 2 subjects received 300 mg doses. Following review of concentrations and tolerability, the remaining 8 subjects received 450 mg doses. Side effects were assessed at each sampling timepoint using a self-administered questionnaire with a 5-point rating scale (5 = most severe). Plasma samples were assayed for OXC and MHD using a validated HPLC assay. Lower limit of detection for MHD was 0.01 mcg/ml and 0.015 mcg/ml for OXC. Maximum concentration (Cmax) and time to maximum concentration (tmax) were obtained directly from the plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs). AUCs were determined for both OXC and MHD via non-compartmental analysis using WinNonLin. Relative bioavailability was calculated as (AUCrectal/AUCoral)*100%. AUC and Cmax of MHD following each route of administration were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Results: Mean relative bioavailability of MHD was 10.15% (SD 6.73) in the 2 subjects receiving 300 mg doses and 7.77% (SD 5.93) in the 450 mg dose subjects. The MHD Cmax and AUC at the 450 mg dose level differed significantly between routes (p < 0.01). The most common side effects were headache and fatigue; there was no discernable difference between routes. One subject rated discomfort of rectal administration as 3/5, another reported discomfort of oral administration 1/5 due to taste. Most subjects had a few clinical labs outside the normal range, each was considered clinically insignificant. Conclusions: The Cmax and exposure to MHD after rectal administration of OXC suspension are significantly less than after oral administration. It is unlikely that adequate MHD concentrations can be reached by rectally administering diluted OXC suspension.

This is in contrast to the previously accepted physician request for dispensing ?brand medically necessary.? Other drugs newly included in that list included warfarin, cyslosporine and levothyroxine. Pre and post phenytoin concentrations were measured for eight patients changed from brand Dilantin to Mylan's phenytoin and given the same dose. All patients had a fall in phenytoin concentrations and most required a dose adjustment to attain concentrations between 10?20mcg/ml. Some patients required a dose increase to the extent that the monthly cost for generic exceeded their previous cost for branded product. One patient reported breakthrough seizures during this transition. Widespread complaints to the Medicaid program from patients and caregivers affected by this mandate resulted in a withdrawal of that requirement three months after its inception. Brand product may now be dispensed if the physician documents on a Medwatch form that they anticipate an adverse outcome. Methods: Retrospective chart review. Results: Serum Concentration and Doses will be presented in table form. Conclusions: Change from brand Dilantin to generic formulation may result in a fall in serum concentrations. 1 Joan A. Conry, 2 R. Eugene Ramsay, 3 David Vossler, and 4 Tracy A. Glauser ( 1 Department of Neurology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC ; 2 International Center for Epilepsy, University of Miami Medical School, Miami, FL ; 3 Swedish Medical Center, Seattle, WA ; and 4 Division of Neurology, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH ) Rationale: This study assessed the efficacy and safety of zonisamide (ZNS) as adjunctive therapy in patients with primary generalized epilepsy. Methods: Fifty-six patients with refractory primary generalized epilepsy received open-label adjunctive ZNS for up to 172 weeks. During the primary study phase (Weeks 0?16), ZNS was titrated in 100-mg increments to efficacy or a maximum dosage of 600 mg/d (Weeks 1?8); this dosage was then maintained (Weeks 8?16). If a patient was unable to achieve a ZNS dosage in an increment of 100 mg by Week 16, and the lower dose forms were not commercially available, he or she was permitted to enter the extension phase (Weeks 16?172). During the extension phase, patients were evaluated every 12 weeks for 36 weeks and every 24 weeks for the next 96 weeks, for a total of 5 scheduled study visits (including screening and baseline [BL]) during the primary phase and 8 during the extension phase. Efficacy was assessed by change from BL in seizure type/frequency and investigator/patient global assessments (GAs); safety evaluations included assessment of adverse events (AEs). Results: Forty-eight patients completed the primary phase; mean ZNS dosage was 4.8 mg/kg per day, and mean treatment duration was 112 days. Forty-two patients were included in the extension phase; mean ZNS dosage was 4.7 mg/kg per day, and mean duration of treatment was 411 days. The number of patients with absence seizures decreased from BL (n = 44, 78.6%) to Week 16 (n = 33, 58.9%) and Week 172 (n = 9, 22.5%), as did the number of patients with myoclonic seizures (BL: n = 23, 41.1%; Week 16: n = 13, 23.2%; Week 172: n = 8, 20.0%) and tonic-clonic seizures (BL: n = 19, 33.9%; Week 16: n = 14, 25.0%; Week 172: n = 7, 17.5%). Overall, median number of seizures per month changed from 49.5 at BL to 23 at Week 16 and 41.0 at Week 172. Investigator/patient GAs of seizure control improved from mean scores of 3.10 (investigator) and 4.17 (patient) at BL to 6.11 (investigator) and 5.92 (patient) at Week 16. Investigator and patient GAs of seizure frequency varied during the extension phase but were consistently higher than BL values. Patient GAs of well-being did not change substantially during the study. Five patients (8.9%) discontinued ZNS for AEs. Nine patients (16.1%) had serious AEs (SAEs), 2 of whom had SAEs that were considered ZNS related. Most frequently reported treatment-related, treatment-emergent AEs were tiredness (17.9%), somnolence (14.3%), anorexia (10.7%), agitation/irritability (8.9%), and fatigue (8.9%). Conclusions: Zonisamide was effective adjunctive therapy in patients with primary generalized seizures (absence, tonic-clonic, myoclonic) and was generally safe and well tolerated. (Supported by Eisai Inc.) 1 David Critchley, 2 Eliane Fuseau, 1 Carlos Perdomo, and 1 Santiago Arroyo ( 1 Eisai Global Clinical Development, Ridgefield Park, NJ ; and 2 EMF Consulting, Aix en Provence, France ) Rationale: The objective of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and dose-response relationships of rufinamide as adjunctive therapy in patients with inadequately controlled seizures associated with ennox Gastaut syndrome. Methods: Pharmacokinetic and PD data were collected from rufinamide-treated and placebo patients participating in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group 84-day study. Blood samples were collected to determine rufinamide plasma levels at Visits 4 and 6 (Days 28 and 84) of treatment, or when a patient was discontinued from the trial. Adverse events (AEs) reported by ≥10% of patients in either treatment group were considered for the analysis. For population PK and PK/PD analyses, non-linear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM) was used with first-order estimation and first-order conditional estimation methods. Rufinamide efficacy variables were based on the total seizure frequency and tonic-atonic seizure frequency as indicated in a seizure diary. Results: A total of 65 patients were included in the PK analysis and 129 in the PK/PD analysis. PK data were described by a 1-compartment model. Clearance (CL) increased linearly with increased body surface area independent of patient age, sex, or race. Apparent CL in adults was 6.65 L/h, adolescents 4.51 L/h, and children 2.77 L/h, and was unaffected by liver and kidney function. In general, children had a higher average steady-state concentration (Cavss) than adolescents and adults due to a lower rufinamide CL and higher administered dose per kilogram. Rufinamide bioavailability decreased with increasing doses. Of the coadministered antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) analyzed (lamotrigine, topiramate, and valproate), only valproate significantly affected rufinamide CL, producing a 40% increase in rufinamide Cavss in children and 11% increase in adults. Log-transformed total seizure frequency and tonic-atonic frequency were shown to decrease proportionally with increasing rufinamide concentrations. These relationships were not affected by concomitant treatment with valproate, lamotrigine, clonazepam, or topiramate or patient baseline characteristics. Rufinamide significantly improved the global evaluation of seizure severity, in a concentration-dependent manner. None of the concomitant AEDs or other covariates evaluated affected the PK/PD relationship. Rufinamide exposure had no relationship to AEs occurring in ≥10% of the patients in either treatment group. Conclusions: Rufinamide oral bioavailability decreased with increasing doses, and CL was proportional to body surface area. Coadministration of valproate led to a moderate reduction in rufinamide CL, but lamotrigine and topiramate did not affect this parameter. Rufinamide efficacy was linearly related to concentration, but the frequency of AEs was unaffected. (Supported by Eisai Inc.) 1 Nihal C. De Lanerolle, 2 Tih-Shih W. Lee, and 3 Shrikant Mane ( 1 Neurosurgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT ; 2 Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT ; and 3 Keck Biotechnology Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT ) Rationale: Levetiracetam is an anticonvulsant whose action is reported to be through the selective and high affinity binding to a protein called SV2A, which is involved in synaptic vesicle function (PNAS 2004, 101:9861?9866). SV2 is a glycoprotein present in all neural cells and occurs in 3 isoforms ? SV2A, SV2B and SV2C. The SV2 synaptic vesicle proteins are structurally similar to vesicular transporters for neurotransmitters. Levetiracetam is of mixed effectiveness in the treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). This study looks at the expression of the synaptic vesicle protein SV2 genes and well as genes for several other proteins involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle (Annu.Rev. Neurosci. 2004, 27: 509?47) to assess the potential effectiveness of this drug at hippocampal seizure foci in TLE patients Methods: Hippocampi surgically removed from patients for the control of medically intractable seizures were used in this study. Hippocampi with mesial sclerosis (MTLE) were compared to those without sclerosis from patients with extrahippocampal temporal mass lesions (MaTLE) and with no clear etiology (PTLE). Gene expression patterns in the two groups were compared for hippocampal area CA2/CA1 using DNA microarray analysis and the Affymetrix platform with GeneChip U133A. The expression patterns of the SV2 proteins (A.B. and C) as well as synaptic cycle proteins Synapsins, Synaptogyrins, Synaptogamins, Synaptobrevins, Synaptophysins, Rab proteins, RIM proteins, SCAMPs and SVOP were comared among others. Results: The comparisons showed that there were significantly reduced expression levels of SV2A and SV2B in the sclerotic hippocampi of the MTLE group compared non-sclerotic hippocampi. The levels of SV2C were undetectable as expected of this minor isoform in the brain. The majority of the other proteins were also reduced or undetectable. Conclusions: The reduction of the SV2 and other synaptic vesicle cycle proteins in area CA1 of MTLE hippocampi may reflect the significant neuronal loss in this region of this patient group. Hippocampal sclerosis is the hallmark of the pathology of this patient group, and in the absence of the necessary mechanism for the action of this drug, may suggest that it may be of limited efficacy for this subtype of TLE. However, for PTLE and MaTLE patients, where synaptic vesicle proteins are unaffected, Levetiracetam may be expected to be useful. (Supported by NS048434.) 1 Sylvie Di Nicola, 2 Patricia R. Grossman, 3 Amie Joyce, and 3 Daniel A. Ollendorf ( 1 Ariane II, Transiciel, Brussels, Belgium ; 2 Global Health Outcomes Research, UCB Pharma, Smyrna, GA ; and 3 Health Outcomes, Pharmetrics, Watertown, MA ) Rationale: To investigate healthcare utilization, costs and compare the incidence of adverse events (AEs) in commercially-insured epileptic patients initiating levetiracetam (LEV) or gabapentin (GBP). Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis of patients diagnosed with epilepsy was conducted using a large US medical and pharmaceutical claims database (July 2001 - December 2003). Patients without any LEV or GBP prescription during a 6-month baseline period were classified into mutually exclusive treatment groups based on their first LEV or GBP medication prescription. Patients were followed for a total of 12-months with a minimum 3-month duration required. GBP patients were matched on a 1:1 basis to LEV patients by clinical characteristics, seizure and therapy types. Utilization and cost were analyzed using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test while risk of AEs was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Treatment groups (n = 816 each) were comparable: mean age ?39 years, ?63% women, 64% generalized seizures, 65% adjunctive therapy. Patients received more prescriptions for LEV compared to GBP (mean/patient/year: 8.3 vs 6.0, p < 0.001), which generated higher LEV pharmacy costs ($1,319 vs $648, p < 0.001). Healthcare utilization was significantly lower in LEV patients than in GBP patients for physician office visits (18.1 vs 20.8, p < 0.01), emergency-room visits (8.5 vs 11.0, p < 0.01), other outpatient visits (35.7 vs 40.6, p < 0.05) and medications other than anti-epileptics (24.4 vs 36.5, p < 0.001). Less utilization translated into significantly less cost in favor of LEV for emergency-room visits ($880 vs $1,094, p < 0.01) and medications other than anti-epileptics ($1,995 vs $2,396, p < 0.001). Although the difference did not reach statistical significance, GBP showed higher costs than LEV for hospitalizations ($11,189 vs $8,275) and overall costs (i.e., total pharmacy, outpatient and inpatient costs: $24,001 vs $22,432). The percentage of patients free of any AE during follow-up was significantly higher for LEV than for GBP (38% vs 29%, p < 0.001). Median time to first AE was longer for LEV than for GBP (42 vs 28 days). The hazard ratio for the time to first AE (LEV vs GBP) was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.68?0.86; p < 0.001). Conclusions: In a commercially-insured setting, treatment for epilepsy with LEV was associated with significantly less utilization and costs of common healthcare services than GBP. Rate and risk of AEs were lower in LEV compared to GBP. Data suggest better adherence to LEV compared to GBP treatment. These differences may suggest that use of LEV could lead to cost control.

Rossi, and 1 Amala Soumyanath ( 1 Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR ) Rationale: Botanicals such as valerian and passionflower are commonly used by epilepsy patients and may have some anticonvulsant effects. In mouse models, Passiflora extracts have been shown to have anxiolytic effects and inhibit pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures. Active ingredients are presumed to be flavonoids. Many flavonoids interact with benzodiazepine receptors, and the flavonoids chrysin and hispiduline have been found to inhibit PTZ-induced seizures in rodent models. Methods: The flavonoid content of commercial extracts from Passiflora incarnata whole herb was analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The WSP2 strain of mice, which are genetically prone to handling-induced convulsions (HIC), was used to test for anticonvulsant effects of the extracts. HIC were assessed at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours and 4 hours after a single i.p. injection. The effects of the extracts on GABAergic neurotransmission were examined with voltage-clamp recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells in acutely prepared rat hippocampal slices in the presence of the glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenic acid (1 mM). Results: A total of 14 different flavonoid peaks were detected with a total flavonoid content of 2.7% in one of the extracts. Handling-induced convulsions in WSP2 mice were inhibited at a dosage of 1000 mg/kg of whole Passiflora extract beginning 30 minutes to 1 hour after i.p. injection. Application of Passiflora extract to hippocampal slices generated inhibitory currents in voltage-clamped (Vh = -30mV) CA1 pyramidal cells in a dose dependent fashion beginning at 100?g/ml. The extract induced inhibitory current was abolished by application of the GABAA receptor selective antagonist, GABAzine (20 ?M). Conclusions: Whole Passiflora extracts show anticonvulsant action in seizure-prone WSP2 mice, and induce a GABAA receptor-mediated current in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. If, as presumed, flavonoids are the active ingredient of Passiflora, the dosages of 1000 mg/kg in WSP2 mice and of 100 ?g/ml in hippocampal slices would correspond to 27 mg/kg and 2.7 ?g/ml of flavonoids which would be pharmacologically relevant. Further studies are needed to determine the actual active ingredients and pharmacological mechanisms and to evaluate any potential clinical significance of these findings.

Selassie ( 1 Biostatistics, Bioinformatics,  and 2 Department of Neurology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC ) Rationale: The goal of antiepileptic therapy is no seizures and no side effects. Monotherapy is the standard to try to achieve this. Many of the newer antiepileptic medications appear better tolerated with fewer side effects but are costly. People with refractory epilepsy have experienced improved seizure control and quality of life when converted from polypharmacy without worsening of their seizures. Methods: We utilized a dataset of all 2001  and 2 Eisai Global Clinical Development, Ridgefield Park, NJ ) Rationale: To evaluate the potential effect of rufinamide on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 6 concomitantly administered antiepileptic drugs (AEDs): carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, topiramate, and valproate. Methods: Data were analyzed from 5 multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group studies of pediatric and adult patients with inadequately controlled seizures treated with 1 to 3 AEDs. Rufinamide or placebo treatment duration varied from 39 to 140 days, according to study, with baseline periods from 28 days to 3 months. Dosages of concomitant AEDs were kept constant from baseline throughout the duration of each study. Blood samples to measure concomitant AED concentrations were collected before, during, and after treatment with rufinamide or placebo. Data were standardized across all studies and pooled to produce a single data set. Population PK analysis used non-linear mixed effect modeling (NONMEM). The clearance of a linear PK model was estimated for each AED; age was used as the scaling factor to adjust clearance among children, adolescents, and adults for carbamazepine, topiramate, and valproate, and weight was used as the scaling factor for lamotrigine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin. Results: Six populations of rufinamide patients with concomitant AEDs were analyzed: (1) carbamazepine, n = 903, median age 32.3 years (range 3.9?68.8 y); (2) lamotrigine, n = 200, median age 22.7 years (range 4.7?68.5 y); (3) phenobarbital, n = 149, median age 34.5 years (range 4.3?62.6 y); (4) phenytoin, n = 299, median age 34.4 years (range 4.5?72.3 y); (5) topiramate, n = 69, median age 15.6 years (range 4.1?53.7 y); (6) valproate, n = 488, median age 27.2 years (range 4.3?68.6 y). The clearance of topiramate and valproate was not modified by rufinamide. The clearance of carbamazepine and lamotrigine was increased and the clearance of phenobarbital and phenytoin was decreased as a function of rufinamide plasma concentration. Rufinamide-induced changes in AED clearance were similar across age groups. At a rufinamide plasma concentration of 15 ?g/mL (representing the average steady-state concentration in a typical patient at doses of 45 mg/kg per day in children and 3200 mg/d in adults), the percent change in AED clearance was less than 18% of values without rufinamide. None of the clearance changes for the concurrent AEDs would result in changes of steady-state AED concentrations greater than 21% in typical subjects. Conclusions: The magnitude of rufinamide effects on the PK parameters of concomitantly administered AEDs is unlikely to be of clinical significance. The effect of rufinamide on clearance of carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin did not differ with age.

AED monotherapy may diminish the exposure risk of drug-drug interactions resulting in decreased healthcare utilization and costs of epileptic patients. Levetiracetam (LEV) is an effective, well-tolerated, novel AED indicated for use as adjunctive therapy in partial onset seizures in adults with epilepsy. There has been interest in using LEV as monotherapy for epilepsy. Clinical studies are ongoing to ascertain LEVs' efficacy and safety. The objective of this study was to compare, in a claims database, healthcare utilization and costs between LEV and a classical first generation AED, phenytoin (PHT), when prescribed as monotherapy to epileptic patients. Methods: Analyses were conducted using a large US medical and pharmaceutical claims database. Patients diagnosed with epilepsy newly started on PHT or LEV monotherapy between July 2001 and December 2003 were selected. A 6-month baseline period with no claim for PHT or LEV and a minimum 3-month follow-up were required. PHT patients were matched on a 1:1 basis to LEV patients with similar characteristics. Healthcare utilization (inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy) and associated costs were collected for each patient and annualized. Mean utilization and costs per patient were then compared between treatment groups using non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Results: LEV and PHT monotherapy patients (n = 348 in each group) had similar characteristics: mean age ?36 years, ?42% men, 37% partial seizures. LEV monotherapy patients showed statistically significantly lower annual mean healthcare utilization than PHT monotherapy patients for emergency-room visits (7.87 vs 11.21, p < 0.01), EEGs (0.87 vs 1.13, p < 0.01), CT scans (0.35 vs 0.71, p < 0.001), magnetic nuclear resonance (0.59 vs 0.97, p < 0.01), AED monitoring (0.47 vs 3.43, p < 0.001), hematologic function tests (3.12 vs 3.78, p < 0.01), hepatic function tests (0.96 vs 1.60, p < 0.001) and hospitalizations (0.34 vs 0.64, p < 0.01). Generally, decreased resource utilization translated into less cost per patient. While total pharmacy costs were higher for LEV ($2,841 vs $2,054, p < 0.001), given higher drug cost for LEV, other healthcare costs were less for LEV (total outpatient: $7,784 vs $8,440, ns; hospitalizations: $5,306 vs $11,857, p < 0.05). Overall costs (pharmacy, outpatient and hospitalizations) were lower for LEV ($15,931 vs $22,351, ns). Conclusions: This study shows that most outpatient and inpatient resource utilization and costs were significantly lower for LEV monotherapy patients than for PHT monotherapy patients. When comparing LEV with a classic first generation AED, healthcare providers should consider all healthcare utilization and costs and not just direct pharmacy costs.

Frost ( 1 Pharmacy, Childrens Hospitals of Minnesota and United Hospital, St. Paul, MN ; 2 Epilepsy, Minnesota Epilepsy Group, P.A., St. Paul, MN ; 3 Neurology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN ; and 4 Neurology and Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN ) Rationale: Rectal administration of AEDs offers a beneficial route of administration for patients who are unable to take medications orally and an IV route is not available. To date, no case reports of rectal administration of levetiracetam (LEV) have been published. The purpose of our review is to report our findings on rectal absorption of LEV in an adult and a pediatric patient. Methods: Inpatient charts for both patients were retrospectively reviewed for LEV dosing, LEV concentrations, administration procedures, weight and complications. LEV concentrations were analyzed by MedTox Labs, MN for Case 1 and Mayo Labs, MN for Case 2. Results: CASE 1: 56 yr old male in the ICU for frequent seizures was intubated and receiving medications IV or via feeding tube. LEV on admission was 1500mg per tube BID at 0800, 2200; trough level (16.8 mg/L). LEV was increased to 2000mg BID on Day 2. Beginning on day 8, due to poor tolerance of tube feedings, LEV was administered rectally at the same dose for 8 days. A series of 6 LEV levels was obtained surrounding the first rectal dose at -1, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 11 hours post administration. Results as follows: 36.8 mg/L, 42.6 mg/L, 36.1 mg/L, 35.6 mg/L, 31.5 mg/L, 25.1 mg/L, respectively. A trough level prior to the 4th dose of rectal LEV was 16.4 mg/L. LEV administration was changed back to feeding tube administration 2000mg BID with one steady state trough LEV level obtained (49.5 mg/L, Day 27). Another steady state trough level on 1750mg BID per feeding tube was obtained on Day 55 (32.4 mg/L). LEV suspension was administered undiluted and the buttocks held for 30 minutes. No seepage was noted. Irritation could not be assessed. CASE 2: 16 month old male with uncontrolled focal seizures and multiple benzodiazepine loads was started on LEV 250mg (21 mg/kg) per rectum x1. A one hour post dose level was obtained (6.6 mg/L). LEV continued at 100mg (8.5 mg/kg) BID oral/rectal with doses 2 and 3 administered rectally. On 200mg (17 mg/kg) po BID, a steady state trough LEV = 4.5 mg/L. LEV suspension was administered undiluted and the buttocks held for 5 minutes. Seepage was questionable per RN after the first dose, but not identified with doses 2 or 3. Irritation could not be assessed. Conclusions: Levetiracetam was administered rectally in two patients. These data confirm that LEV is absorbed with rectal administration. However, steady state trough concentrations may be decreased more than 50% compared to feeding tube administration at the same dose. These preliminary data suggest a dosing ratio adjustment of approximately 2:1 for rectal administration of LEV may be necessary. 1 Gregory L. Holmes ( 1 Neurology, Darrtmouth Medical School, Lebanon, NH ) Rationale: Patients with epilepsy are at high risk for anxiety. Antiepileptic drugs that have antianxiety properties are highly desirable since both anxiety and epilepsy can be treated with a single drug. Clorazepate dipotassioum (Tranxene) is a prodrug that is converted to the active antiepileptic drug N-desmethyldiazepam. Clorazepate has been used since the mid 1960s as an antianxiety agent and as adjunctive therapy for management of partial seizures. The past few years has seen the introduction of eight new antiepileptic drugs and the vagal nerve stimulator. Whether clorazepate dipotassium continues to be useful in this new new era of antiepileptic therapy remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to re-examine the efficacy and safety of clorazepate in 2005. Methods: Medical records of 12 patients (mean age = 22.4 years) taking clorazepate dipotassium were retrospectively reviewed. Records were reviewed for patient's age, dose of clorazepate dipotassium, duration of treatment. efficacy, and side effects. Results: Clorazepate dipotassium was used to treat complex partial seizures in 7 patients, myoclonic seizures in 3 patients, and a mixed seizure disorder in 2 patients. Dosage varied from 0.5 to 3 mg/kg/day. Clorazepate dipotassium resulted in a seizure reduction of >50% in 8 of 12 (66.7%). In all 12 patients clorazepate dipotassium was well tolerated and felt to be a mood stabilizer in 6 of 12 (50%). Side effects were minimal, and when reported consisted primarily of letheragy. In 10 of 12 (83.3%) of patients clorazepate dipotassium was continued for > 1 year without development of tolerance. None of the patients were taken off clorazepate because of side effects. The drug was particularly useful in patients who complained of insomnia. Conclusions: Despite the introduction of many new antiepileptic drugs, clorazepate dipotassium (Tranxene) remains a very useful antiepileptic drug in patients with poorly controlled seizures. The antianxiety features of the drug makes this an appealing choice in patients who have the co-morbid condition of anxiety. Unlike other benzodiazepines, the drug has few adverse side effects. While tolerance can occur, it appears less commonly than with other benzodiazepines. Clorazepate dipotassium should be considered as potential therapy in patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy and anxiety disorders.

Complex tight junctions linking adjacent endothelial cells make brain capillaries around 100 times tighter than peripheral capillaries to small hydrophilic molecules. As a result, drugs required to act in the brain, including antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), have generally been made lipophilic, able to cross the brain endothelium via the lipid membranes. However, such lipophilic drugs are potential substrates for efflux carriers of the BBB which are known to be over-expressed in epileptic brain. We have tested the predictive ability of a new BBB model based on co-culture of C6 rat glioma and bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) differentiated in a BBB phenotype under dynamic conditions (DIV-BBB). We also compared the permeation properties in this model against a widely used static transwell system. Methods: BAEC and C6 were grown in DMEM medium. In the DIV-BBB cells were co-cultured for 14 days using polypropylene hollow fibers inside a sealed chamber (the?extraluminal space?) accessible by ports. A variable-speed pulsatile pump generates flow from the medium source through the capillary bundle allowing diffusion of nutrients out to the extra luminal space (ECS) through the 0.64 mM trans-capillary pores. Metabolic products are similarly removed. In parallel experiments, static BBB co-cultures were established in Transwell apparati. Permeability to a highly polar molecule (3H sucrose) and a widely used AED (14C Phenytoin) were measured. A similar experiment was performed after osmotic opening of the BBB with intraluminal mannitol. Transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured to assess the barrier integrity during the establishment on the BBB and during the course of the experiments. Results: The TEER values in the DIV-BBB were on average >800 Ohm cm2, against a value of 40 in Transwells. The average sucrose permeability measured in 3 independent experiments was 5.5 x10?6 cm/sec in the DIV-BBB against 8.2 x10?5 cm/sec in the Transwell system (p < 0.05). Phenytoin permeability was on average 1.4 x10?5 cm/sec in the DIV-BBB and 7.8 x10?5 cm/sec in the Transwell model. Osmotic opening of the BBB by hyperosmolar injection of mannitol lead to a 1000x increase in both sucrose and Phenytoin permeability in the DIV-BBB. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the DIV-BBB recapitulates some of the crucial characteristics of the in situ BBB, including tightness (high TEER), and selective permeability. Drug screening by traditional Transwell methods may give false permeability values, in particular for drugs that are poorly permeant across the BBB. Additional experiments with human cell isolated from drug resistant epileptics will further help characterize the utility of this model for CNS drug delivery studies.

Messenheimer ( 1 Neurology, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC ) Rationale: Change in body weight is a common side effect of treatment with some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). AED therapy can yield both significant weight gain or weight loss depending upon the choice of AED. Ideally, treatment with an AED should have no impact on body weight. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the effects of lamotrigine (LAMICTAL?, LTG) as adjunctive therapy on body weight in patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures. Methods: Patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy with PGTC seizures who were receiving 1 or 2 AEDs at study entry were eligible. Patients with partial seizures were excluded on the basis of seizure history and screening electroencephalograms. There were three study phases: Baseline; Escalation, during which study drug was titrated to a target dose (12 weeks for patients 2?12 years, 7 weeks for patients >12 years); Maintenance, during which doses of study drug and concomitant AEDs were maintained for 12 weeks. Body weight was measured at Baseline and at the end of the Maintenance Phase and was analyzed with descriptive statistics. Results: A total of 117 (58 LTG, 59 placebo (PBO)) PGTC patients were randomized and received study drug. In the LTG group, 50% of the patients were male and the mean age was 27 years. Fifty-six (56) percent of the patients in the PBO group were male and the mean age was 25 years. Mean weight at study entry was 64.0kg in the LTG group and 69.1kg in the PBO group. Efficacy results showed a significant reduction of PGTC seizures with LTG. The median reduction from Baseline in PGTC seizures was 82% in the LTG group and 43% in the PBO group during the Maintenance Phase (p = 0.006). The mean and median change from Baseline in body weight to the end of the Maintenance Phase in the LTG group was 0.4kg (SD = 3.5) and 0.0kg, respectively. In the PBO group, the mean and median change from Baseline in body weight to the end of the Maintenance Phase was 1.7kg (SD = 5.1) and 0.2kg, respectively. These results are similar to a previously reported study in patients with partial and generalized seizures (Biton et al., Neurology 2001). In that study, the mean weight gain from Baseline to the end of the Treatment Phase in the LTG treatment group was 1.3lb (SD = 11.9), with 29% of the LTG patients being seizure-free. Conclusions: The results from this study, combined with those reported previously, show that LTG monotherapy and adjunctive therapy are associated with stable body weight in patients with either PGTC or partial seizures.

Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany ) Rationale: We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to study the effects of 7 antiepileptic drugs (AED) on associative long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity and motor learning in eight healthy subjects. Methods: LTP was induced by paired associative stimulation and motor learning was investigated in a repeated thumb movement practice protocol. Single oral doses of the following AED were tested in a placebo-controlled double-blind cossover design: 20 mg of diazepam, 1100 mg of gabapentin, 300 mg of lamotrigin, 3000 mg of levetiracetam, 3600 mg of piracetam, 15 mg of tiagabine, and 100 mg of topiramate. Drugs were tested in separate sessions at least one week apart in pseudo-randomized and balanced order. Results: LTP-like plasticity was significantly depressed by those AED, which enhance gamma-butyric acid (GABA) dependent inhibition (tiagabine, diazepam, and in addition levetiracetam). Gabapentin showed a trend towards enhancement of LTP-like plasticity. The testing of effects of AED on motor learning is work in progress. Conclusions: The main finding is that associative LTP-like plasticity in human motor cortex is suppressed by levetiracetam, diazepam and tiagabine. The effects of diazepam and tiagabine are in agreement with the literature, which shows that increase of neurotransmission through the GABAA receptor results in reduction of LTP in rodent hippocampus and neocortex. The suppression of LTP-like plasticity by levetiracetam may also be attributed to its GABAergic mechanisms, which mainly occur through reversal of GABAA receptor inhibition by the negative allosteric modulators zinc and ß-carbolines. An alternative though not mutually exclusive explanation for the effect of levetiracetam is its capability of suppressing repetitive neuronal discharges in various models of epilepsy. A single TMS pulse over motor cortex results in a high-frequency repetitive discharge of corticomotoneuronal cells, which may be a requirement for LTP-like plasticity to develop. The lack of suppression of LTP-like plasticity by other modes of action, in particular the blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels, is in accordance with the animal literature. As a next step, the results of LTP modulation will be compared with the effects of AED on motor learning. Previous studies showed congruence of neuromodulatory effects on LTP and motor learning, suggesting that these two processes share common mechanisms.

Perdomo, and 2 Santiago Arroyo ( 1 Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD ; and 2 Eisai Global Clinical Development, Ridgefield Park, NJ ) Rationale: The present analysis, based on the pooled analysis of the adverse event (AE) reports from clinical studies, was conducted to evaluate the short- and long-term safety of rufinamide in patients with epilepsy. Methods: Safety data was derived from 12 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies and 12 controlled or open-label studies of rufinamide for short- and long-term therapy, respectively. Analysis was performed on patients with epilepsy who received ≥1 doses of study drug. Adverse events were analyzed using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and were presented by system organ class (SOC). Common AEs that occurred in ≥10% of patients were identified. Time to onset of common AEs was evaluated in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Results: The short-term safety of rufinamide versus placebo was evaluated in 1240 rufinamide-treated patients and 635 placebo patients (mean ages, 31.7 and 28.6 y, respectively) who had a median duration of exposure of 2.8 and 3.0 months, respectively. The mean dose of rufinamide was 1373 mg/d. The most frequently reported AEs for rufinamide versus placebo patients included headache (22.9% vs 18.9%), dizziness (15.5% vs 9.4%), fatigue (13.6% vs 9.0%), somnolence (11.8% vs 9.1%), and nausea (11.4% vs 7.6%). The time to onset of these AEs was comparable between the groups and suggested an early onset with quick resolution. Serious AEs occurred in 6.3% of rufinamide-treated and 3.9% of placebo patients, with epilepsy-related events such as convulsions the most commonly reported. A higher percentage of patients in the rufinamide group (8.1%) than the placebo group (4.3%) discontinued treatment due to AEs. Rufinamide as long-term therapy was assessed in 1978 patients (mean age, 31.3 y) in controlled or open studies of <1 month to >4 years in duration; 47% of patients were given the drug for ≥12 months. Mean daily dose of rufinamide was 1700 mg/d (maximum daily dose, 7200 mg/d). Adverse events occurred most commonly within the SOCs of the nervous system (64.7%) and gastrointestinal disorders (42.3%). The most frequently reported AEs with long-term follow-up were headache (29.5%), dizziness (22.5%), and fatigue (17.7%); 13.1% of patients discontinued rufinamide due to AEs. Serious AEs were reported in 13.2% of patients; convulsion, status epilepticus, and pneumonia were the most common. The rates of AEs generally increased as the median dose of rufinamide increased. The differences by dose may be confounded by the duration of treatment, since patients who were given higher doses were treated at those doses for longer periods of time. Conclusions: Rufinamide was well tolerated in over 1000 patients with epilepsy. The time frame of common AEs suggested an early onset of events with rapid resolution. In the long term, rufinamide was safe and well tolerated in a large population of patients with epilepsy. (Supported by Eisai Inc.) 1 Greg Kricorian, and 2 Jeffrey Debs ( 1 Medical Affairs, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA ; and 2 College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL ) Rationale: Diastat? (diazepam rectal gel), a seizure rescue medication that can be administered by nonmedical caregivers without the need for hospitalization, is currently provided in fixed unit-dose devices. However, a new delivery system (AcuDial?) that features a prefilled, adjustable-dose device will meet the diverse dosage needs of individual patients via a single delivery system. Once the prescribed dose has been set or ?dialed in? by a pharmacist, the device is locked to prevent further changes. The purpose of this study was to measure the ability of pharmacy staff to understand dose-setting and syringe-locking instructions affixed to the new delivery system and to properly fill a new diazepam rectal gel prescription. Methods: Participants were selected by pharmacy managers from Southern California retail pharmacy locations to test their ability to properly fill a prescription for the new diazepam rectal gel delivery system (12.5 mg dose). Selected pharmacists or technicians were provided with a delivery system twin pack and a field study sheet with instructions on preparing the prescription and dispensing the materials. All study materials were collected after the prescription was filled. Results were scored in 3 categories: prescription filled correctly (correct adjustment to prescribed dose and locking of both syringes), prescription filled incorrectly (failure to adjust to prescribed dose and/or lock both syringes), and unable to dispense (incomplete syringe dose setting or locking of syringe, but would not have dispensed without consulting the manufacturer or pharmacy manager). Unable to dispense is not considered a test failure. Results: The field study participants were 50 pharmacy staff members (pharmacists, n = 26; pharmacy technicians, n = 23; intern, n = 1) at 26 Vons retail pharmacies located in 3 Southern California counties (Orange, Riverside, and San Diego Counties). Of the 50 participants, 46 filled the prescription with no errors, 2 filled the prescription incorrectly, and 2 were unable to dispense. The overall number of properly filled prescriptions was 46/48 (96%). The 2 dispensing errors involved the final locking of the syringes at 1 pharmacy and failure to prepare the second syringe in the twin pack at another pharmacy. Conclusions: The high overall success rate demonstrates that pharmacy staff can follow dose-setting and syringe-locking instructions to properly fill a prescription for diazepam rectal gel dispensed via the new delivery system. (Supported by Valeant Pharmaceuticals.) 1 Kevin McCague, 1 Monique Somogyi, and 1 Stefan Schwabe ( 1 US Clinical Development  1 study: 2100 mg/day), 2 were dose-controlled studies (300 and 2400 mg/day), and 1 was a regimen-controlled study (2700 mg/day BID vs TID). The duration of the double-blind period for the studies ranged from 12 to 60 weeks. Responder rates (seizure free, ≥75% and ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency) through 3 months, 6 months and 1 year were analyzed for the intent to treat (ITT) population and patients who completed 1 year of therapy (completers). The placebo-controlled study and 2 dose-controlled studies were not included in the completer analysis since the duration of these studies was less than 1 year. Within each population, newly diagnosed and refractory subgroups were analyzed separately. Results: A total of 674 patients were included in the ITT analysis: 343 newly diagnosed and 331 refractory patients. Of the 286 completers, 208 were newly diagnosed and 78 were refractory patients. For the ITT population, the mean baseline seizure rate was 4.2 seizures/28 days for the newly diagnosed patients and 8.7 seizures/28 days for the refractory. For the completers, the mean baseline rate was 3.4 and 2.4 seizures/28 days for the newly diagnosed and refractory, respectively. Response rates for the newly diagnosed and refractory patients are presented below: Percent of patients seizure-free through 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year ITT population n = 674 Completers n = 286 Newly ?diagnosed ?n = 343 ?Refractory ?n = 331 Newly ?diagnosed ?n = 208 ?Refractory ?n = 78 3 months 62.8 11.5 69.2 29.5 6 months 56.4 ?9.7 61.1 23.1 1 year 52.5 ?7.9 55.8 16.7 Conclusions: Collectively, the results of this meta-analysis suggest that a sizeable proportion of patients with partial seizures become seizure-free after 3 months of oxcarbazepine monotherapy. Furthermore, newly diagnosed patients who become seizure-free tend to remain seizure-free over the long-term with continued oxcarbazepine monotherapy.

We sought to determine whether 25-OH-D levels and bone turnover are affected by treatment with carbamazepine (CBZ) or the similar newer AED oxcarbazepine (OXC). Methods: We measured 25-OH-D serum levels, serum parathormone (PTH) levels, and several biochemical markers of bone turnover, including serum osteocalcin (OSCL), serum bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), and urinary crosslinked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTX) in normal adult controls (n = 24) and adult epilepsy patients taking either CBZ (n = 22) or OXC (n = 24) in monotherapy for over 8 weeks. CBZ patients were then switched overnight in a 2:3 ratio to OXC monotherapy, and after 6 weeks the same tests were repeated. Results: 25-OH-D levels were lower in each drug-treated group (OXC 19.4 ± 2.3pg/ml, CBZ 20.4 ± 2.4) than in the controls (27.5 ± 2.8) (ANOVA, p = 0.052). Post-tests showed significance for the comparison of OXC to controls (p < 0.05). PTH values in the OXC (55.6 ± 6.5pg/ml) and CBZ groups (55.6 ± 6.2) were higher than in controls (45.7 ± 4.7), though not significantly (p > 0.1). BAP levels were somewhat higher, and NTX levels lower, in the OXC and CBZ groups compared to controls, but without significance (p > 0.05). OSCL levels were somewhat elevated in the OXC group (2.79 ± 0.47ng/ml) and more clearly elevated in the CBZ group (3.63 ± 0.36) compared to controls (2.38 ± 0.41), with the overall comparison being significant (p < 0.05) and the post-tests showing some significance in the comparison between CBZ and control groups (p = 0.053). Because all of the data (except OSCL) were so similar between OXC and CBZ groups, they were combined to increase statistical power. The combined drug treatment group had significantly higher BAP (p = 0.02) and significantly lower 25-OH-D (p = 0.015) than controls. The latter effect was signficant even after accounting for the confounding effects of age on 25-OH-D levels (p < 0.05). No differences were found in the CBZ patients before and after switch to OXC. Conclusions: Epilepsy patients taking OXC or CBZ have significantly lower 25-OH-D and significantly higher bone turnover (as measured by BAP) than do normal controls. These patients are likely to be at risk for long term bone loss. Our data cannot exclude the possibilty that this is a function of the disease rather than the treatment, though data from other studies suggests this is unlikely. Pending further investigations, it may be prudent for patients on CBZ or OXC to be co-administered high-dose 25-OH-D replacement. (Supported by Novartis Pharmaceutical Corporation.) 1 James Layne Moore ( 1 Neurology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH ) Rationale: Though important factors in the success of treatment for epilepsy, both medication satisfaction and medication preference as indicated by the patient, parent (in the case of adolescents), and physician are frequently not adequately measured in traditional clinical trials. Through increased medication compliance, both satisfaction and preference can play a role in disease outcome. In this study, medication satisfaction and preference instruments were used to derive data from subjects switched from immediate-release carbamazepine (IR-CBZ) to an equal total daily dose of Carbatrol? extended-release capsules (CBZ-ERC) at a minimum of 400 mg/d Methods: At baseline, eligible and enrolled subjects were switched from their current IR-CBZ product to an equal total daily dose of CBZ-ERC. Grounds for exclusion from this multicenter study included: known history of generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus or epilepsy syndrome that may potentially worsen with carbamazepine treatment, progressive neurological disorder, receiving more than 1 additional antiepileptic drug or any type of neuroleptic drug, or CBZ-ERC treatment within 90 days of study screening. Data from 358 patients with epilepsy were collected, as well as data from 391 physicians, and 33 parents (of adolescent study participants). Assessment was performed at baseline (month 0) and month 3 using medication satisfaction and preference instruments. Medication satisfaction, preference and compliance instruments used in this study were questionnaires designed to evaluated the acceptability of Carbatrol? versus the previous IR-CBZ treatment regimen. Separate questionnaires were designed for, and completed by, patients, parents, and physicians. Satisfaction questionnaires used a 6-point scale with answers ranging from ?strongly agree? to ?strongly disagree, ?while preference questionnaires used 3 answer categories: ? prefer new medication, ?? prefer previous medication, ? and ? equal preference.? Results: Results of medication satisfaction and preference instruments at month 3 from patients switched from IR-CBZ to CBZ-ERC showed improvements in every variable queried. Overall, 78.8% of both patients and parents (of adolescent patients), as well as 86.4% of physicians preferred CBZ-ERC to previous IR-CBZ medications. Patient responses also indicated that compared to 38.7% at baseline (IR-CBZ), 58.6% of patients ?strongly agree? that they rarely skip or miss a dose of their medication (with CBZ-ERC). Conclusions: Results indicate that according to patients, parents (of Adolescent study participants), and physicians, CBZ-ERC is preferred to IR-CBZ for the treatment of partial-onset epilepsy resulting in improved compliance. (Supported by Shirev 1 Astrid Nehlig, 1 Marie-Aude Rigoulot, and 1 Any Boehrer ( 1 INSERM U 666, Faculty of Medicine, Strasbourg, France ) Rationale: The models of genetically determined generalized epilepsy have been extensively used to determine the anticonvulsant properties of drugs. In the present work, we report the effects of a new drug in development, RWJ 333369 in the genetic model of non-convulsive absence epilepsy, the GAERS (Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg) and in the genetic model of sound-induced convulsive seizures, the audiogenic Wistar AS rat. In GAERS, absence seizures are accompanied by the occurrence of spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) on the EEG. In Wistar AS, the exposure to an intense sound stimulus induces one or two wild running and bouncing episodes followed by a tonic seizure and a prolonged catatonic state Methods: GAERS were equipped with four cortical electrodes over the fronto-parietal cortex and the duration of SWDs on the EEG was recorded in groups of eight rats for periods of 20 to 120 min after the injection of 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg RWJ 333369 i.p. In Wistar AS, the occurrence of, latency to and duration of one or two wild running episodes and the tonic seizure were recorded in groups of eight rats at 60 min after the injection of 10 or 30 mg/kg RWJ 333369. Results: In GAERS, RWJ 333369 dose-dependently reduced the expression of SWDs. The lower 10 mg/kg dose had no significant effect. At 30 mg/kg, SWDs were completely attenuated between 40 and 60 min and the duration of SWDs was reduced by 72% at 80 min, but returned to control levels by 100 min. At 60 mg/kg, SWDs were completely attenuated from 40 to 120 min. In Wistar AS, RWJ 333369 at 10 mg/kg increased the latency to the first running episode by 266% and its duration by 160% in 7 out of 8 rats, and induced the occurrence of a second running episode in 3 out of 8 rats. This second running episode, which was not present in control rats, is indicative of a decrease in sensitivity of the rats to the auditory stimulus. The 10 mg/kg dose of RWJ 333369 also increased the latency to the tonic seizure by 327% in 6 of the 8 studied rats that experienced these seizures, and one out of 8 rats exhibited no wild running and no seizure. At 30 mg/kg, RWJ 333369 suppressed the expression of all seizure-related behaviors in all rats. Conclusions: The present results demonstrate that this novel drug, RWJ 333369, has potent and broad efficacy on primary generalized seizures of both the tonic reflex and the absence type in genetic models of epilepsy (Supported by Johnson  Department of Pharmacology, Xuan Wu Hospital, Capital University of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China; New England School of Acupuncture, Watertown, MA; and Departments of Neurology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical, Boston, MA ) Rationale: Extracts of individual herbs are increasingly studied in vitro and in vivo for their anti-convulsant properties. However, in traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine, herbs are often prescribed in combination for the management of seizures. Therefore, we undertook a systematic review to assess the scientific evidence supporting the use of herbal formulas for the treatment of epilepsy. Methods: A literature search was carried out in March 2005 using PubMed, Embase, PsychInfo, AltHealth from its inception to date. In addition, the Chinese Medicine Database, Korean Medical Database, and Korean Drug Research Information Center were retrieved, and the bibliographies of initially identified articles were also checked. The keywords used in the search were: (?Epilepsy? OR ?fit? OR ?seizure? OR ?anticonvulsant? OR ?antiepileptic?) AND (?plant? OR ?phyto*??herb*? OR ?Chinese medicine? OR ?Korean Medicine? OR ?Ayurvedic medicine? OR ?Kampo?). Any clinical studies, including case studies, reporting the results of treating epilepsy with herbal formulas were included for the systematic review after identification from two authors, who also extracted the data using a predefined form. All authors then reviewed the findings. The studies were categorized based on the combinations of herbs that herbal formulas reported. Results: A total of 71 studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. There were three randomized controlled trials, 5 non-randomized controlled trials, 6 case control studies, and 57 observational studies including case reports. Rarely was the same herbal formula used in more than one study. Over 135 individual herbs were used singly or in various combinations in these investigations. Conclusions: Despite the significant number of published studies using herbal formulas for the treatment of epilepsy, evidence to support their use in patients with this disorder is lacking. Further research incorporating methodological rigor and consistent herbal formulas is warranted. 1 John M. Pellock, 2 Michael D. Privitera, 3 Renzo Guerrini, 4 Steven Wang, 4 Walter Neto, 4 Jeffrey S.

Methods: Data were analyzed for 1,669 children and adults (≥2 yrs old) in 2 double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and in an open-label dose-optimization trial. In a dose-controlled RCT, patients were randomized to 50 or 400 mg/day and had to achieve at least 25 or 200 mg. A second RCT compared fixed dosages of 100 and 200 mg/day TPM with 600 mg carbamazepine (CBZ) and 1250 mg valproate (VPA) in patients with untreated epilepsy. TPM dosing in the open-label study was based on clinical response in order to achieve optimal effect (7 months follow-up). Results: In a dose-controlled RCT, a significant difference favoring the higher TPM dose was observed at 2 weeks when groups had been titrated to 25 or 100 mg TPM, suggesting that 100 mg is a potentially effective titration target. The study comparing antiepileptic drugs found that TPM (100 and 200) is at least as effective as CBZ and VPA. When open-label TPM was titrated with 100 mg/day as the target dose for initial evaluation of therapeutic response and subsequent adjustments for optimum response, the mean maintenance dosage at 7 months endpoint was 3.5 mg/kg/day in children and 150 mg/day in adults. The most common adverse events with TPM monotherapy in were paresthesia, headache, fatigue, appetite decrease, and somnolence. Conclusions: Topiramate is effective as initial therapy in children and adults with epilepsy. The data from RCTs and a dose-optimization study support the recommendation of 3 mg/kg/day in children or 100 mg/day in adults as an appropriate dose at which to evaluate the initial response when starting topiramate as monotherapy.

Methods: The study used a randomised, double-blind, parallell-group design. Patients aged 65 years or older, who had experienced two or more unprovoked seizures (partial seizures, with/without secondary generalisation, or primary generalised tonic/clonic seizures) were included from five European countries. Excluded were subjects previously treated with any antiepileptic drug for more than 2 weeks in the 6 months prior to randomisation. The patients were randomised 1:1 to treatment with LTG or CBZ-r on a b.i.d. schedule. The dose was escalated over 4 weeks and then adjusted based on efficacy and adverse events. The initial, maintenance and maximum daily doses were 25mg, 100mg and 500mg of LTG, and 100mg, 400mg and 2000mg of CBZ-r, respectively. The duration of the maintenance phase was 36 weeks. Results: Of 184 randomised subjects 93 received LTG (46 males = 49%) and 91 received CBZ-r (56 males = 62%). Mean age was 74.3 years (SD6.2) vs. 73.1 years (SD5.5) in the two treatment groups, respectively. In the LTG group, 68 of 93 subjects completed the study (73%), compared to 61 of 91 (67%) in the CBZ-r group (p = 0.33). Time to first seizure was shorter in the LTG group in the Per Protocol analysis set (25% fractile in the survival curve: 8.4 weeks on LTG vs. 19.3 weeks on CBZ-r, p = 0.022); however the difference was not significant in the Intention to Treat (ITT) set, using the log-rank test. The proportion of seizure-free subjects in the 4 to 40 week treatment period, not accounting for subjects withdrawn before week 4, were 53 of 87 (61%) on LTG, and 68 of 90 (76%) on CBZ-r (p = 0.036). The number of subjects seizure-free from week 20 to week 40, after excluding from the analysis those who withdrew before week 20, was 53 of 75 (71%) for the LTG group and 59 of 69 (86%) for the CBZ group (p = 0.032). The number of individuals who experienced adverse events (AE) did not differ in the two groups. The number of AEs leading to stop permanently of the treatment was 23 (25%) on CBZ-r compared to 13 (14%) on LTG. There was no difference in AEs being judged to be related to the study drug by the investigator. Conclusions: With the treatment schedules investigated in this study, CBZ-r produced greater seizure-freedom rates, whereas LTG tended to be associated with lesser AE-related withdrawals. Retention on treatment was comparable in the two groups.

Methods: Single-centre, open-label, parallel-group study in 12 young (18?40 years) and 12 elderly (65 or over) healthy subjects. In each age group, 6 subjects were female and 6 were male. The study consisted of a single-dose (600 mg) period (Phase A) and a multiple-dose (600 mg, once-daily, for 8 days) period (Phase B), separated by 4 days. Results: Eslicarbazepine acetate was extensively metabolized to eslicarbazepine (S-licarbazepine), the main active metabolite. Plasma concentration-time profiles of eslicarbazepine following the single-dose of Phase A and the last dose of Phase B are presented in Figure 1. Following a 600 mg single-dose, mean maximum eslicarbazepine plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to infinity (AUC0-∞) were respectively 9.9 ?g/mL and 180.9 ?g.h/mL in young subjects, and 9.5 ?g/mL and 196.0 ?g.h/mL in elderly subjects, and respectively 9.3 ?g/mL and 171.9 ?g.h/mL in male subjects, and 10.1 ?g/mL and 205.0 ?g.h/mL in female subjects. After multiple-dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations were attained at 4 to 5 days of administration in both age and gender groups, consistent with an effective half-life in the order of 17?18 hours. Post last dose of Phase B, mean Cmax and AUC0-∞ of eslicarbazepine were respectively 17.3 ?g/mL and 296.7 ?g.h/mL in young subjects, and 15.1 ?g/mL and 294.3 ?g.h/mL in elderly subjects, and respectively 15.5 ?g/mL and 295.8 ?g.h/mL in male subjects, and 16.8 ?g/mL and 295.2 ?g.h/mL in female subjects. Following single-dose, the eslicarbazepine Cmax, AUC0?24 and AUC0-∞ elderly/young geometric mean ratios (GMR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were 0.95 (0.81, 1.14), 1.02 (0.86, 1.24) and 1.06 (0.88, 1.32) and the female/male GMR (95%CI) were 1.09 (0.87, 1.43), 1.16 (0.95, 1.48) and 1.17 (0.90, 1.63), respectively. Following last dose, the eslicarbazepine Cmax, AUC0?24, and AUC0-∞ elderly/young GMR (95%CI) were 0.88 (0.77, 1.03), 0.98 (0.90, 1.09), and 1.01 (0.89, 1.18) and the female/male GMR (95%CI) were 1.10 (0.98, 1.27), 1.04 (0.88, 1.28), and 1.01 (0.83, 1.30), respectively. Conclusions: The pharmacokinetic profile of eslicarbazepine acetate was not affected either by age nor gender. 1 Monique Somogyi, and 1 Kevin McCague ( 1 US Clinical Development  lack of response, or patient or carer concern about adverse effects led to TPM withdrawal. Results: Complete seizure control was obtained in 5% of patients. Most achieved a useful reduction in seizure frequency of between 40?80%. A small number reported a shift in seizure spectrum towards milder and/or shorter events. Several patients with tuberous sclerosis (TS), achieved a good effect on seizure control with a final TPM dose of 800ng or higher, with no significant adverse effects. TPM did not have a noticable benefit in tonic seizures. Further analysis of seizure frequency was complicated by factors such as comcomitant withdrawal of other AEDs. In 4 cases, all with cryptogenic/symptomatic generalised epilepsies, TPM was associated with increased seizure frequency and paraictal behavior disturbance, unresponsive to dose reduction but improving on TPM withdrawal. 2 cases were withdrawn due to weight loss; there were no other withdrawals. In several cases carers and patients reported being brighter and more alert. In everyday situations no memory impairment was noted and no patient complained of slowed thinking. A patient with coexisting Prader-Willi syndrome achieved not only improvement in seizure control but also significant improvement in his eating disorder. Conclusions: With slow dose escalation, TPM was well tolerated in people with ID across the age range, and no obvious cognitive effects that interfere with everyday life were noted. Indeed some reported subjective improvement. Some adults with TS may tolerate and benefit from high doses of TPM. Treatment-emergent behavioral effects were associated with paradoxical increase in seizure frequency in some patients; further investigation may reveal an at-risk phenotype. Our pratice continues to support the value of community-based specialist nusre monitoring of dose regimes and adverse events. 1 Jonathan Tisdell, and 1 William A. Tosches ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Massachusetts, Hopedale, MA ) Rationale: This study was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of long-term zonisamide as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy by conducting a retrospective chart review of patients with epilepsy. Methods: Charts of neurology clinic patients with a variety of seizure types were reviewed to identify patients treated with zonisamide for ≥3 months. The efficacy of zonisamide was based on the reduction in seizure frequency, and safety of zonisamide was evaluated by reports of adverse events (AEs). Both results were based on physicians' notes and patient reporting. Results: A total of 112 male and female zonisamide-treated patients were identified for the study. Of these, 90 patients (n = 45 monotherapy, n = 45 adjunctive therapy) who were taking zonisamide therapy for ≥3 months were included in the efficacy analysis; all 112 patients were included in the safety analysis. The patients' ages ranged from 14 to 97 years (mean, 54 y). The duration of zonisamide therapy ranged from 3 to 46 months (mean, 24.3 mos), and the zonisamide dosages ranged from 100 to 1000 mg/d (mean, 324 mg/d). Complex partial seizures and partial seizures with secondary generalization were the most common seizure types. Of the 90 patients included in the efficacy analysis, 38 (42%; n = 25 monotherapy, n = 13 adjunctive therapy) were seizure free on zonisamide at the end of the study. A ≥50% seizure frequency reduction was observed in 26 patients (29%; n = 9 monotherapy, n = 17 adjunctive therapy). A total of 15 zonisamide-treated patients experienced either no effect (10%; n = 4 monotherapy, n = 5 adjunctive therapy) or an unknown effect (7%; n = 4 monotherapy, n = 2 adjunctive therapy) on seizure frequency. Thirty of the 112 patients (27%) reported AEs and these included (≥2% of subjects) weight/appetite loss (5.4%), fatigue (4.5%), sedation (2.7%), and gastrointestinal distress (2.7%). A total of 22 patients (20%) discontinued zonisamide therapy; 8 discontinued for unknown reasons, 1 due to ineffective seizure control, and 13 patients (12%) discontinued due to AEs, which included GI distress, rash, weight loss, and fatigue. Conclusions: Zonisamide was effective as long-term monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in patients with various seizure types, and was safe and well tolerated in these patients.

This study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of high- versus low-dose rufinamide monotherapy in patients with inadequately controlled partial seizures with or without secondary generalization. Methods: In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study, patients with inadequately controlled partial seizures on 1 or 2 AEDs were randomized to a low dose (n = 70; 300 mg/d) or a high dose, (n = 72; 3200 mg/d) of rufinamide for 112 days. Concomitant AED regimens were simultaneously tapered and discontinued over a 42-day period beginning at randomization. Patients either completed 112 days of treatment or were allowed to exit the study by meeting criteria based on severity and frequency of seizures. The primary efficacy outcome was the percentage of patients meeting 1 exit criterion; the secondary efficacy outcome was the time to meeting 1 exit criterion. Safety was assessed by the presence and frequency of adverse events (AEs), physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, and laboratory assessments. Results: A total of 142 patients (age, ≥12 years) entered the study. The percentage of patients meeting 1 exit criterion was 66.7% and 72.5% for the high- and low-dose groups, respectively; the difference was not significant (p = 0.4402). Median time to meeting 1 exit criterion showed a trend favoring high dose (56 days) versus low dose (32 days), but was not statistically significant (p = 0.0968). The most commonly reported AEs (≥10% of patients in either group) for high dose versus low dose were nausea (23.6% vs 7.1%), headache (19.4% vs 8.6%), and fatigue (15.3% vs 2.9%). There were no deaths during the course of this study. Nonfatal, serious AEs occurred in 4 patients receiving 3200 mg/d rufinamide and in 2 patients receiving 300 mg/d rufinamide. Three patients from the 3200 mg/d group were discontinued from the study due to nonserious AEs. No clinically relevant changes in vital signs, ECG recordings, or laboratory parameters were noted Conclusions: Efficacy analysis showed no significant difference between groups in the percentage of patients meeting 1 of the exit criteria. Adverse events were comparable between the 2 groups, with a greater incidence of AEs in the high-dose group. (Supported by Eisai Inc.) 1 Edwin Trevathan, 2 Susan P. Kerls, 2 Anne E. Hammer, 2 Alain Vuong, and 2 John A. Messenheimer ( 1 Pediatric Epilepsy Center, Division of Pediatric and Developmental Neurology, Departments of Neurology and Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO ; and 2 GSK, Research Triangle Park, NC ) Rationale: There are very limited data on the treatment of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) from randomized clinical trials (RCT). We performed a sub-analysis of data among patients with JME who participated in a recently completed RCT. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted on lamotrigine (LAMICTAL?, LTG) as adjunctive therapy in the the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures in patients ≥ 2 years of age. Patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy with PGTC seizures who were receiving 1 or 2 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at study entry were eligible. Patients with partial seizures were carefully excluded. There were three study phases: Baseline; Escalation (7?12 weeks), during which study drug was titrated to a target dose; Maintenance, during which doses of study drug and concomitant AEDs were held constant for 12 weeks. A total of 121 patients were randomized, and 117 entered the dose escalation phase of the study; analysis of these data have been presented previously. Data on the 33 patients who met clinical diagnostic criteria for JME were analyzed by intent-to-treat methods and are now reported. Results: 33 patients with JME (17 LTG, 16 placebo (PBO)) 2 to 52 years of age were randomized and received study drug. There was no significant difference between the JME patients randomized to LTG compared to those randomized to PBO by age, age at first generalized tonic-clonic seizure, or median seizures per month at screen. The median percent change from Baseline in PGTC seizure frequency (the primary efficacy endpoint) during the entire treatment period was a 72% decrease in the LTG group and a 16% decrease in the PBO group (p = 0.020). During the entire treatment period a ≥ 50% decrease in PGTCS frequency was achieved by 71% (12 of 17) in the LTG group and 31% (5 of 16) in the PBO group (p = 0.038). For all seizure types, the median percent change from Baseline in seizure frequency during the entire treatment period was a 44% decrease in the LTG group and a 20% increase in the PBO group (p = 0.011). The percent of patients in the LTG group with a ≥50% increase in all seizures remained constant throughout the study (1/16; 6%). There was no difference in the number of patients who reported one or more adverse events (AE) between the LTG group (3/17; 18%) and the PBO group (3/16; 19%). Two patients from the LTG group (one an intentional carbamazepine overdose, and the second an episode of status epilepticus) and no patients from the PBO group discontinued the study prematurely due to an AE. Conclusions: Adjunctive LTG therapy was effective in the treatment of PGTC seizures, and was well-tolerated, among patients with JME. (Supported by GSK.) 1 Jennifer A. Collins, 1 Karla J. Walker, and 1 Gregory C. Janis ( 1 Clinical Toxicology, MEDTOX Laboratories, Saint Paul, MN ) Rationale: Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) of anticonvulsants is an important tool in the management of patients with seizure disorders. We have previously reported the development of an analytical method for these compounds utilizing HPLC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LCMSMS). This comprehensive method can analyze up to 13 anticonvulsant drugs from a single sample using minimum sample volume. The sensitivity of the LCMSMS method allows us to propose the use of a filter paper collection technique for monitoring anticonvulsant drug levels. This would provide a means for caregivers to collect TDM samples at crucial time points in non-medical settings, as well as facilitate routine sample collection. We have recently initiated a study protocol with a clinical practice group to establish relative equivalence of the anticonvulsant concentrations in each matrix and to validate the feasibility of the alternative collection/testing paradigm. Preliminary data is presented. Methods: Subjects enrolled in the study adhere to the monitoring schedule prescribed by treating physicians. Venipuncture samples are collected in the clinic. A lancet is then used to pierce the finger and capillary blood is collected onto a Filter Paper (FP) blood collection device and a serum separator FP device. Specimens are transported to the laboratory for testing. Specimens tested for the comparison are: venous whole blood, venous plasma, capillary whole blood on FP and capillary plasma on FP. The plasma sample collected by venipuncture is considered the predicate sample/method for comparison purposes. In the laboratory, the filter paper specimens are processed for testing by punching circles from the filter paper and placing them into test tubes. Internal standards are added and the analytes are solubilized into a mixture of acetonitrile and water. Quantitative standards and controls are processed the same manner. Processed samples, standards and controls are analyzed by LCMSMS using the methods developed for the target compounds. Results: Preliminary results for one of the monitored compounds, Lamotrigine (LamictalR) are presented in Figure 1. This data represents a limited number of sampling points (n = 6); the study protocol is designed for 20 or more comparisons for each compound. Linear regression statistics indicate correlation coefficients > 0.956 for each matrix. Conclusions: This preliminary data demonstrates excellent correlation of lamotrigine concentrations in samples obtained using alternative sampling techniques. As the study progresses, additional data will allow for more rigorous comparisons for the included anticonvulsant compounds.

We examined its anticonvulsant properties in an animal model of acute, partially drug-resistant self-sustaining status epilepticus (SSSE). Methods: SSSE was induced by 30 min intermittent stimulation of the perforant path (PPS) through chronically implanted electrodes in free running adult male Wistar rats. Brivaracetam (0.3?300 mg/kg), vehicle, levetiracetam (2-500 mg/kg), diazepam (10 mg/kg) and brivaracetam/diazepam combinations were injected intravenously 40 min. after onset of PPS. Results: Brivaracetam injected iv during established SSSE, shortened the cumulative duration of active seizures in a dose-dependent manner, to 11% of vehicle-treated controls (20 mg/kg) and 0.8% of controls (300 mg/kg), compared to 35% of C after levetiracetam (200 mg/kg), 11% of C after seletracetam (300 mg/kg), 15% of C after diazepam (10 mg/kg) and 1% of C after fosphenytoin (50 mg/kg PE). Brivaracetam, like levetiracetam, potentiated the effect of diazepam: diazepam (1 mg/kg) or brivaracetam (1 mg/Kg) alone had no significant effect, but when combined, they reduced the duration of active seizures to 3% of C. Conclusions: Brivaracetam displayed potent anticonvulsant effects in this animal model of SSSE. However, like all drugs, it required doses much higher for control of established SSSE than those which are effective in animal models of partial and generalized epilepsy.

Nye, and 2 Steven Wang ( 1 Child Neurology, University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN ; and 2 Johnson  2 Osher Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA ; and 3 McLean Hospital, Boston, MA ) Rationale: Huperzine A (HupA), a sesquiterpene alkaloid derived from Chinese club moss (Huperzia serrata), has traditionally been used in China for swelling, fever and inflammation. HupA crosses the blood-brain barrier and is a potent and reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. HupA also has been shown to reduce glutamate-induced neuronal death and act as an NMDA receptor antagonist. We therefore screened HupA for evidence of efficacy and toxicity in two animal seizure models. Methods: HupA was evaluated in the mouse maximal electroshock (MES) and s.c. Metrazol (pentylenetetrazol; s.c. Met) models of generalized tonic-clonic and myoclonic seizures, respectively following p.o. administration to Swiss-Webster mice. Minimal motor impairment was evaluated in the rotarod test. Results: HupA was found to be active against s.c. Met- but not MES-induced seizures. Peak anticonvulsant activity was observed one-hour after p.o. administration of 1 mg/kg. At the doses tested (i.e., 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg), a maximum of 62.5% protection was observed at a non-toxic dose of 1 mg/kg. Behavioral motor impairment in 75 and 100% of mice tested was observed at doses of 2 and 4 mg/kg, respectively. Conclusions: HupA was found to display potent, but incomplete protection against clonic seizures induced by s.c. Met. These results demonstrated that HupA is orally bioavailable and reaches effective brain concentrations. Given that HupA is an NMDA receptor antagonist, it may also be effective as neuroprotective therapy for the prevention of epileptogenesis and seizure-induced neuronal toxicity. On-going studies are currently evaluating this hypothesis. (Supported by NINDS Contract NO1-NS-4-2359 (HSW) and a grant from The Epilepsy Project (S.S.).) 1 Sunil Mehta, and 1 Brenda Y. Wu ( 1 Department of Neurology, UMDNJ- Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ ) Rationale: Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) in the context of acute medical problems is associated with substantial mortality. About 1/3 of NCSE cases are refractory to traditional antiepileptics and intermittent benzodiazepines. Treatment with high dose benzodiazepine or barbiturate to achieve burst-suppression EEG pattern can be effective, but failure rate and post-treatment recurrence rate are considerable in refractory cases. Moreover, intubation for airway protection is not always feasible. As levetiracetam (LEV) has a unique mechanism of action with minimal systemic side effects and is effective in treating chronic epilepsy, its use in NCSE is studied. Methods: We reviewed 9 consecutive cases of NCSE treated with levetiracetam (3/2004- 4/2005). These patients, aged 48?89, were diagnosed with NCSE by clinical observation and EEGs. Given 1?2 antiepileptics ± intermittent lorazepam, they showed no clinical and electrographic improvement before initiation of 500 mg LEV (1000 mg in case 9). Continuous i.v. infusion of midazolam (MDZ) was given at least 12 hours after LEV loading in case 6 and 8, and simultaneously with LEV in case 4. A successful response is defined as being seizure-free for at least one week.

Two of the non-responders died due to profound cerebral structural abnormalities. In cases treated with LEV followed by MDZ infusion, 2 out of 3 patients were seizure-free on LEV monotherapy. Conclusions: This study suggests that LEV may be effective in control refractory NCSE but less effective in conditions of severe intracranial abnormalities. Further investigation is necessary.

Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal?) was approved by the SFDA in 2004 for the treatment of partial or generalized tonic-clonic epilepsy in children and adults. ?? Oxcarbazepine has a different pharmacokinetic profile comparing to carbamazepine. From US and European studies Oxcarbazepine shows an improved safety profile, but there is limited data from Asian populations. ?? The recommended dosing of oxcarbazepine is mostly from studies in Caucasians. Information regarding the appropriate dosing in Asian populations is needed. Methods: ?? This was a prospective open-label, study conducted in Chinese patients with partial or generalized tonic-clonic epilepsy who were newly diagnosed. ?? Treatment period was 24 weeks that included flexible dosing of oxcarbazepine monotherapy. ?? Efficacy assessments were seizure free rate and seizure frequency reduction ≥50% (percentage of patients). ?? Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study. Results: Patient characteristics ?? A total of 325 patients were enrolled. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. Efficacy Responder rate ?? Overall, 70% of patients responded to therapy at 24 weeks. Of these patients, 225(69%) and 196(60%) were seizure free at week 12 and 24 respectively (Figure 1). Dosing ?? The starting dose of oxcarbazepine was 251.85±129.34(50?750)mg/day and the maintenance dose was 644.67±287.69(150?1500)mg/day. The is no significant different among different age groups. Tolerability ?? A total of 63(19%) patients experienced AE's, leading to discontinuation in only 3.1%. The most frequency reported AEs were dizziness 11(3.4%); headache 6(1.8%); somnolence 14(4.3%); asthenia 4 (1.2%) and skin rash 9 (2.8%). 1 [ Proportion of total patients showing an improvement in seizure frequency at 12 and 24 weeks ] Conclusions: ?? The results from this study of newly diagnosed patients with partial or generalized tonic-clonic epilepsy confirm the efficacy and tolerability of oxcarbazepine, when prescribed as monotherapy for Chinese patients. ?? A maintenace dose of oxcarbazepine close to 650mg allows for optimal seizure control with an excellent tolerability profile. This dosage seems to be lower than Caucasians. ?? The nature, frequency and severity of AEs reported in this study were consistent with those previously reported in US or European studies.

AB  - Abstract The critical role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in mediating inflammatory lung injury in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been raised recently. The present study has identified enhanced MIF protein expression in alveolar capillary endothelium and infiltrating macrophages in lung tissues from ARDS patients. The possibility that MIF up-regulates its synthesis in an autocrine fashion in ARDS was tested using cultured endothelial cells stimulated with MIF and a murine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury. MIF induced significant MIF and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α synthesis in cultured endothelial cells and the effect was blocked by neutralizing anti-MIF antibody. A similar blocking effect was observed when MIF-stimulated endothelial cells were pretreated with neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibody or glucocorticoid, supporting the notion that MIF induced TNF-α production via an amplifying pro-inflammatory loop. Treatment with anti-MIF or glucocorticoid effectively attenuated pulmonary pathology and the synthesis of MIF or TNF-α in mice with LPS-induced acute lung injury. Mildly augmented expression of aquaporin 1 (AQP1) was also detected in alveolar capillary endothelium in ARDS. In vitro studies revealed that both MIF and TNF-α induced a small increase of AQP1 synthesis in cultured endothelial cells. These findings suggest that MIF plays a crucial pathological role leading to alveolar inflammation in ARDS. Anti-MIF and early glucocorticoid therapy may represent a novel therapeutic approach for reducing alveolar inflammation in ARDS. Copyright ? 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract The expression of the immunoglobulin superfamily member myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-R (TN-R) by oligodendrocytes overlaps in time and space. The two molecules can be neurite outgrowth- inhibitory or -promoting depending on the neuronal cell type and the environment in which they are presented. Here we show that the two molecules directly bind to each other in vitro and that binding sites on TN-R localize to two domains, the fibrinogen domain and the epidermal growth factor-like repeat domain with the N-terminal cysteine-rich stretch. We further show by a functional assay, namely the repulsion of MAG-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) cells from a TN-R substrate, that MAG is part of the signalling pathway of TN-R for cell repulsion. When coated as a uniform substrate, MAG was inhibitory for neurite outgrowth of hippocampal and cerebellar neurons in vitro, when compared to poly-l-lysine, while TN-R enhanced neurite outgrowth. When added to MAG, TN-R neutralized the neurite outgrowth-inhibitory effects of MAG, presumably by blocking the neurite outgrowth-inhibitory domain of MAG. J. Neurosci.

AB  - Objectives To review the safety and efficacy of surgical management for spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks of the anterior and lateral skull base. Data Sources A systematic review of English articles using MEDLINE. Review Methods Search terms included spontaneous, CSF, cerebrospinal fluid, endoscopic, middle fossa, transmastoid, leak, rhinorrhea. Independent extraction of articles by 3 authors. Results Patients with spontaneous CSF leaks are often obese (average BMI of 38 kg/m2) and female (72%). Many patients also have obstructive sleep apnea (?45%) and many have elevated intracranial pressure when measured by lumbar puncture. In addition to thinning of the skull base, radiographic studies also demonstrate cortical bone thinning. Endoscopic surgical repair of anterior skull base leaks and middle cranial fossa (MCF) approach for repair of lateral skull base leaks are safe and effective with an average short-term failure rate of 9% and 6.5%, respectively. Long-term failure rates are low. One randomized trial failed to show improved success of anterior leak repairs with the use of a lumbar drain (LD) (95% with vs. 92% without; P?=?0.2). In a large retrospective cohort of MCF lateral skull base repairs, perioperative LD use was not necessary in >94% of patients. Conclusions Spontaneous CSF leaks are associated with female gender, obesity, increased intracranial hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. Endoscopic repair of anterior skull base leaks and MCF or transmastoid approaches for lateral skull base leaks have a high success rate of repair. In most cases, intraoperative placement of lumbar drain did not appear to result in improved success rates for either anterior or lateral skull base leaks. Level of Evidence 2a, Systematic Review.

AB  - Biomineralization is an important tactic by which biological organisms produce hierarchically structured minerals with marvellous functions. Biomineralization studies typically focus on the mediation function of organic matrices on inorganic minerals, which helps scientists to design and synthesize bioinspired functional materials. However, the presence of inorganic minerals may also alter the native behaviours of organic matrices and even biological organisms. This progress report discusses the latest achievements relating to biomineralization mechanisms, the manufacturing of biomimetic materials and relevant applications in biological and biomedical fields. In particular, biomineralized vaccines and algae with improved thermostability and photosynthesis, respectively, demonstrate that biomineralization is a strategy for organism evolution via the rational design of organism-material complexes. The successful modification of biological systems using materials is based on the regulatory effect of inorganic materials on organic organisms, which is another aspect of biomineralization control. Unlike previous studies, this study integrates materials and biological science to achieve a more comprehensive view of the mechanisms and applications of biomineralization.
