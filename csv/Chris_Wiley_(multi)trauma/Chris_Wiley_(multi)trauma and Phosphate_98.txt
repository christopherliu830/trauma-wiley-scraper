AB  - Key points We have developed a novel porcine model of high-thoracic midline contusion spinal cord injury (SCI) at the T2 spinal level. We describe this model and the ensuing cardiovascular and neurohormonal responses, and demonstrate the model is efficacious for studying clinically relevant cardiovascular dysfunction post-SCI. We demonstrate that the high-thoracic SCI model, but not a low-thoracic SCI model, induces persistent hypotension along with a gradual reduction in plasma noradrenaline and increases in plasma aldosterone and angiotensin II. We additionally conducted a proof-of-concept long-term (12 weeks) survival study in animals with T2 contusion SCI demonstrating the potential utility of this model for not only acute experimentation but also long-term drug studies prior to translation to the clinic. Abstract Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the spinal cord injury (SCI) population, especially in those with high-thoracic or cervical SCI. With this in mind, we aimed to develop a large animal (porcine) model of high-thoracic (T2 level) contusion SCI and compare the haemodynamic and neurohormonal responses of this injury against a low-thoracic (T10 level) model. Ten Yorkshire pigs were randomly subjected to 20 cm weight drop contusion SCI at either the T2 or the T10 spinal level. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were continuously monitored until 4 h post-SCI. Plasma noradrenaline (NA), aldosterone and angiotensin II (ANGII) were measured pre-SCI and at 30, 60, 120 and 240 min post-SCI. Additionally, two Yucatan pigs were subjected to T2-SCI and survived up to 12 weeks post-injury to demonstrate the efficacy of this model for long-term survival studies. Immediately after T2-SCI, SBP, MAP and HR increased (P < 0.0001). Between decompression (5 min post-SCI) and 30 min post-decompression in T2-SCI, SBP and MAP were lower than pre-SCI (P < 0.038). At 3 and 4 h after T2-SCI, SBP remained lower than pre-SCI (P = 0.048). After T10-SCI, haemodynamic indices remained largely unaffected. Plasma NA was lower in T2- vs. T10-SCI post-SCI, whilst aldosterone and ANGII were higher. Both chronically injured pigs demonstrated a vast reduction in SBP at 12 weeks post-SCI. Our model of T2-SCI causes a rapid and sustained alteration in neurohormonal control and cardiovascular function, which does not occur in the T10 model.

AB  - Inspired by the physiological events of the ?wound healing cascade?, the integration of biomaterials and growth factors is generally accepted as an emerging and powerful strategy for bone regenerative therapy. As a type of biological mediator, growth factors play a key role in functional bone regeneration. In this review, recent progress in the enhancement of bone-related growth factors via a biomaterial strategy will be discussed. Two main reinforcing mechanisms, temporal regulation and efficacy manipulation, are described in detail, highlighting the potential capability of biomaterials to harness the interactions between growth factors and specific cells. The effects of biomaterials for promoting bone formation via growth factor-mediated osteogenesis are further elucidated. Finally, an outlook of the prospects in terms of superior communication among growth factors, cells, and biomaterials in the microenvironment is presented, which might provide new directions for the design of medical devices for bone regeneration.

AB  - Abstract:? Evidence is accumulating regarding the importance of circadian core oscillators, several associated factors, and melatonin signaling in the maintenance of health. Dysfunction of endogenous clocks, melatonin receptor polymorphisms, age- and disease-associated declines of melatonin likely contribute to numerous diseases including cancer, metabolic syndrome, diabetes type 2, hypertension, and several mood and cognitive disorders. Consequences of gene silencing, overexpression, gene polymorphisms, and deviant expression levels in diseases are summarized. The circadian system is a complex network of central and peripheral oscillators, some of them being relatively independent of the pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Actions of melatonin on peripheral oscillators are poorly understood. Various lines of evidence indicate that these clocks are also influenced or phase-reset by melatonin. This includes phase differences of core oscillator gene expression under impaired melatonin signaling, effects of melatonin and melatonin receptor knockouts on oscillator mRNAs or proteins. Cross-connections between melatonin signaling pathways and oscillator proteins, including associated factors, are discussed in this review. The high complexity of the multioscillator system comprises alternate or parallel oscillators based on orthologs and paralogs of the core components and a high number of associated factors with varying tissue-specific importance, which offers numerous possibilities for interactions with melatonin. It is an aim of this review to stimulate research on melatonin signaling in peripheral tissues. This should not be restricted to primary signal molecules but rather include various secondarily connected pathways and discriminate between direct effects of the pineal indoleamine at the target organ and others mediated by modulation of oscillators.

AB  - Summary This chapter covers all aspects of laboratory medicine including collection, handling, storage, and transport of specimens, as well as procedures and normal ranges. It gives information to understand and perform laboratory medicine. Blood chemistry tests are extremely useful diagnostic tools in veterinary medicine. They are used to evaluate various blood substances to help portray certain body and organ functions. Although many hospitals prefer to send out samples to reference laboratories for evaluation, the knowledge of how to perform a manual complete blood count can be very useful in certain situations, for example, when time is crucial during emergencies, when an automated machine is not functioning properly, or when an automated machine is not at hand. Having rapid results can give the veterinarian insight into the patient's hematologic status or provide information on certain types of anemia, organ functions, and neoplasia. The chapter describes the handling and collection techniques needed to obtain a proper microbial sample.
