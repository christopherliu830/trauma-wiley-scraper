AB  - ABSTRACT Patients with severe abdominal trauma injuries can have improved outcomes if a priority-oriented approach is taken to surgical intervention. This includes temporary abdominal closure and planned reoperation to complete complex, lengthy procedures when the patient is stabilized. Temporary abdominal closure can be achieved safely and cost-effectively by using a presterilized 3-liter cystoscopy fluid IV bag. This article discusses the rationale for temporary abdominal closure and planned reoperation, physiologic considerations in abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), abdominal injuries or conditions leading to ACS, and manifestations of ACS. It compares and contrasts various materials used for temporary abdominal closure, illustrates bag preparation and silo application and removal, and analyzes complex intraoperative and postoperative nursing activities.

AB  - Background Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are regulators of endothelial permeability. Objective Plasma concentrations of Ang-2 and VEGF are increased in dogs with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis and are correlated with disease severity and outcome. Animals Healthy dogs (n?=?18) and client-owned dogs with SIRS (n?=?34) or sepsis (n?=?25). Methods Prospective observational study. Ang-2 and VEGF concentrations in admission plasma samples were compared between healthy dogs and dogs with SIRS or sepsis, and between survivors and non-survivors. Correlations with the acute patient physiologic and laboratory evaluation (APPLEfast) disease severity score were examined. Results Median Ang-2 was significantly higher in dogs with SIRS (19.3; interquartile range [IQR]: 8.6-25.7?ng/mL) and sepsis (21.2; IQR: 10.3-30.1?ng/mL) compared to healthy dogs (7.6; IQR: 6.7-9.8?ng/mL). Ang-2 was significantly higher in non-survivors (24.1; IQR: 11.9-50.0?ng/mL) than survivors (10.2; IQR: 7.2-21.5?ng/mL) but did not correlate with the APPLEfast score. Admission Ang-2 predicted negative outcome in dogs with SIRS and sepsis with reasonable accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.75, confidence interval [CI]: 0.59-0.85; sensitivity: 0.5, CI: 0.29-0.71; specificity: 0.87, CI: 0.75-0.95); differentiation between sepsis and SIRS was poor (AUC: 0.58). Plasma VEGF was significantly higher in dogs with sepsis (45; IQR: 14-107.5?pg/mL) than in dogs with SIRS (3.3; IQR: 0-35.6?pg/mL) or healthy dogs (0; IQR: 0?pg/mL; P =?0.008). VEGF was significantly (P =?.0004) higher in non-survivors (34.5; IQR: 0-105.7?pg/mL) than in survivors (0; IQR: 0-55.2?pg/mL). The ability of VEGF to predict a negative outcome was poor. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Ang-2 may represent a useful additional prognostic marker in dogs with SIRS.

AB  - Success in competing for research funding, acceptance of an abstract, or publication of a manuscript depends in part on the ability to communicate in writing the essence of one's research. The research grant, abstract, and manuscript represent the three primary phases of formally communicating research from planning to dissemination of results. In this paper, perspectives on avoiding the common pitfalls of research writing in terms of content, style, and format are presented to facilitate a successful outcome.

AB  - Abstract In June 2016, an advanced extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) program consisting of a multidisciplinary team was initiated at a large level-one trauma center. The program was created to standardize management for patients with a wide variety of pathologies, including trauma. This study evaluated the impact of the advanced ECMO program on the outcomes of traumatically injured patients undergoing ECMO. A retrospective cohort study was performed on all patients sustaining traumatic injury who required ECMO support from January 2014 to September 2017. The primary outcome was to determine survival in trauma ECMO patients in the two timeframes, before and after initiation of the advanced ECMO program. Secondary outcomes included complication rates, length of stay, ventilator usage, and ECMO days. One hundred and thirty eight patients were treated with ECMO during the study period. Of the 138 patients, 22 sustained traumatic injury. Seven patients were treated in our pre-group and 15 in our post-group. The majority of patients were treated with VV ECMO. Our post group VV ECMO extracorporeal survival rate was 64% and our survival to discharge was 55%. This study demonstrated an improvement in survival after implementation of our advanced ECMO program. The implementation of a multidisciplinary trauma ECMO team dedicated to the rescue of critically ill patients is the key for achieving excellent outcomes in the trauma population.

AB  - Summary The cervical spine is approached in two separate anatomic and functional regions: the craniocervical junction (occiput, C1 and C2) and the subaxial spine (C3 to C7). Injury to the craniocervical junction or cervical spine trauma is usually indirect, related to forces transmitted through the head. Current recommendations for initial imaging in adults with suspected cervical spine injury is a thin slice CT of the cervical spine. The most common fracture of C1 is a bilateral vertical fracture through the neural arch. Fractures of C2 may occur in isolation or in association with additional cervical spine fractures. The most common fracture of C2 involves the odontoid, followed by Hangman's fracture, anteroinferior endplate (hyperextension teardrop) and least commonly, isolated C2 body or posterior element fractures. A burst fracture commonly results from combined axial loading and flexion vector in C5, C6, and C7 locations. Compression fractures are common in elderly patients with osteoporosis.

AB  - ABSTRACT Usage of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in the management of acute and chronic wounds has grown exponentially in the past decade. Hundreds of studies have been published regarding outcomes and methods of therapy used for adult wounds. This treatment is increasingly being used to manage difficult-to-treat paediatric wounds arising from congenital defects, trauma, infection, tumour, burns, pressure ulceration and postsurgical complications in children, although relatively few studies have been aimed at this population. Given the anatomical and physiological differences between adults and children, a multidisciplinary expert advisory panel was convened to determine appropriate use of NPWT with reticulated open cell foam (NPWT/ROCF) as delivered by Vacuum Assisted Closure? (V.A.C.? Therapy, KCI Licensing, Inc., San Antonio, TX) for the treatment of paediatric wounds. The primary objectives of the expert advisory panel were to exchange state-of-practice information on paediatric wound care, review the published data regarding the use of NPWT/ROCF in paediatric wounds, evaluate the strength of the existing data and establish guidelines on best practices with NPWT/ROCF for the paediatric population. The proposed paediatrics-specific clinical practice guidelines are meant to provide practitioners an evidence base from which decisions could be made regarding the safe and efficacious selection of pressure settings, foam type, dressing change frequency and use of interposing contact layer selections. The guidelines reflect the state of knowledge on effective and appropriate wound care at the time of publication. They are the result of consensus reached by expert advisory panel members based on their individual clinical and published experiences related to the use of NPWT/ROCF in treating paediatric wounds. Best practices are described herein for novice and advanced users of NPWT/ROCF. Recommendations by the expert panel may not be appropriate for use in all circumstances. Decisions to adopt any particular recommendation must be made by the collaborating medical team, including the surgeon and wound care specialist based on available resources, individual patient circumstances and experience with the V.A.C.? Therapy System.
