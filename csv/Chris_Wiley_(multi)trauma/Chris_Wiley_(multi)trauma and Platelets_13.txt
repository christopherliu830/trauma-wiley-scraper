AB  - Abstract Epistaxis or nosebleed refers to bleeding from the nostrils, nasal cavity, or nasopharynx. Occasional cases may present with torrential lethal hemorrhage. Three cases are reported to demonstrate particular features: Case 1: A 51-year-old woman with lethal epistaxis with no obvious bleeding source; Case 2: A 77-year-old man with treated nasopharyngeal carcinoma who died from epistaxis arising from a markedly neovascularized tumor bed; Case 3: A 2-year-old boy with hemophilia B who died from epistaxis with airway obstruction in addition to gastrointestinal bleeding. Epistaxis may be associated with trauma, tumors, vascular malformations, bleeding diatheses, infections, pregnancy, endometriosis, and a variety of different drugs. Careful dissection of the nasal cavity is required to locate the site of hemorrhage and to identify any predisposing conditions. This may be guided by postmortem computerized tomographic angiography (PCTA). Despite careful dissection, however, a source of bleeding may never be identified.

AB  - Abstract Ankle and foot injuries are the most common musculoskeletal injuries presenting to Australian EDs and are associated with a large societal and economic impact. The quality of ED care provided to patients with ankle and foot fractures or soft tissue injuries is critical to ensure the best possible outcomes for the patient. This rapid review investigated best practice for the assessment and management of common ankle and foot injuries in the ED. Databases including PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, TRIP and the grey literature, including relevant organisational websites, were searched in 2017. Primary studies, systematic reviews and guidelines were considered for inclusion. English language articles published in the last 12?years that addressed the acute assessment, management or prognosis in the ED were included. Data extraction of included articles was conducted, followed by quality appraisal to rate the level of evidence where possible. The search revealed 1242 articles, of which 71 were included in the review (n?=?22 primary articles, n?=?35 systematic reviews and n?=?14 guidelines). This rapid review provides clinicians managing fractures and soft tissue injuries of the ankle and foot in the ED a summary of the best available evidence to enhance the quality of care for optimal patient outcomes. Following a thorough history and physical examination, including the application of the Ottawa ankle rules, ED clinicians should not only provide a diagnosis, but rate the severity of soft tissue injuries, or stability of fractures and dislocations, which are the pivotal decision points in guiding ED treatment, specialist referral and the follow-up plan.

AB  - We present a young man who developed fat embolism syndrome following a fractured femoral shaft. By intermittently measuring oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter and varying the inspired partial pressure of oxygen we were able to quantify the development of shunt and ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch over the course of his illness. Shunt and low V/Q gradually improved in the week following admission but deteriorated following general anaesthesia for nailing of the femur.

AB  - The blood coagulation balance in the organism is achieved by the interaction of the blood platelets (PLTs) with the plasma coagulation system (PCS) and the vascular endothelial cells. In healthy organism, these systems prevent thrombosis and, in events of vascular damage, enable blood clotting to stop bleeding. The dysregulation of hemostasis may cause serious thrombotic and/or hemorrhagic pathologies. Numerous engineered nanomaterials are being investigated for biomedical purposes and are unavoidably exposed to the blood. Also, nanomaterials may access vascular system after occupational, environmental, or other types of exposure. Thus, it is essential to evaluate the effects of engineered nanomaterials on hemostasis. This review focuses on investigations of nanomaterial interactions with the blood components involved in blood coagulation: the PCS and PLTs. Particular emphases include the pathophysiology of effects of nanomaterials on the PCS, including the kallikrein-kinin system, and on PLTs. Methods for investigating these interactions are briefly described, and a review of the most important studies on the interactions of nanomaterials with plasma coagulation and platelets is provided.

AB  - The parenteral multivitamin preparations that are commercially available in the United States (U.S.) meet the requirements for most patients who receive parenteral nutrition (PN). However, a separate parenteral vitamin D preparation (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) should be made available for treatment of patients with vitamin D deficiency unresponsive to oral vitamin D supplementation. Carnitine is commercially available and should be routinely added to neonatal PN formulations. Choline should also be routinely added to adult and pediatric PN formulations; however, a commercially available parenteral product needs to be developed. The parenteral multi?trace element (TE) preparations that are commercially available in the U.S. require significant modifications. Single-entity trace element products can be used to meet individual patient needs when the multiple-element products are inappropriate (see Summary/A.S.P.E.N. Recommendations section for details of these proposed modifications).

AB  - A 16-year-old male was transported to our emergency department after he was kicked in the abdomen by a horse. He was diagnosed with injury of the liver and abdominal rectus muscle, and was cured by observational treatment. An Ichushi search was undertaken to identify articles published from 1983 to 2013 using the key words ?horse? and ?trauma?. We found 13 cases that described horse-related injuries and summarized these cases, including our case. There were 10 males, three females and one patient of an undescribed sex. The patients ranged in age from 16 to 58 years old, with an average age of 33 years. The injured sites were predominantly the face (mandible) and upper abdomen, indicating that a projecting part of the body may be more likely to be injured. Cardiac rupture, aortic head injury, or lethality induced by a horse kick have not been reported in Japan, but such injuries have been reported in other countries. Ten of 15 cases (67%) required surgical treatment for severe injuries. Horse kick injuries tend to be severe, because the transfer of energy from the end of the hoof, with a small cross-sectional area, to a small field, leads to internal organic injuries that are more severe than predicted, similar to a handlebar injury. Accordingly, we advocate the close observation of patients with horse kick injuries, which may be regarded as being similar to blunt stab wounds or hidden speared injuries.

AB  - Summary Blood transfusion occurs in all parts of the world, but the availability, quality, and safety of the blood depends on the general status of medical care in that area. In contrast, the United States blood supply is provided by many different organizations with different organizational structures and philosophies. Certain areas of the United States are chronically unable to collect enough blood to meet their local transfusion needs. This occurs mostly in metropolitan areas that serve large trauma, tertiary, and transplantation centers. The American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) is a professional, nonprofit, scientific, and administrative association for individuals and institutions engaged in the many facets of blood transfusion and cellular therapies. America's Blood Centers (ABC) is an association of independent not-for-profit community blood centers established in 1962. The Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association (PPTA) is a trade association that advocates for the world's source plasma collectors and producers of plasma-based therapeutics.

AB  - Summary The haemostatic or coagulant system is designed primarily to prevent bleeding and haemorrhage following injury to blood vessels, although some of its constituent proteins have additional roles in inflammation, angiogenesis, and tissue repair. This chapter describes the function and components of the haemostatic system and its role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD). It explores the effect of variants in genes coding for proteins in the haemostatic system on cardiovascular risk. The chapter describes the effect of dietary components on the haemostatic system, both directly and via the development of chronic conditions, such as obesity and diabetes. Platelets have a key function in normal haemostasis and are activated by a number of agonists, particularly thrombin, collagen, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and also adrenaline and serotonin, some of which act synergistically in vivo with other agonists. The fibrinolytic system regulates the degradation of the fibrin matrix. It consists of fibrinolytic factors and fibrinolysis inhibitors.

AB  - Objectives To further clarify the causes of pancytopoenia and to investigate whether underlying cause or severity were associated with survival in an area endemic for vector-borne pathogens. Methods Retrospective review of medical records of 119 dogs with and 238 dogs without pancytopoenia. Results Mixed-breed dogs and dogs younger than one year had higher odds of being pancytopoenic. The most common diagnoses included monocytic ehrlichiosis (n=42), leishmaniasis (n=28) and parvoviral enteritis (n=19). The mean white blood cell counts were lower in dogs with ehrlichiosis and parvoviral enteritis compared to dogs with leishmaniasis, while platelet counts were lower in ehrlichiosis compared to leishmaniasis or parvoviral enteritis. Total protein concentrations were lower in dogs with parvoviral enteritis compared to ehrlichiosis and leishmaniasis. Higher haematocrit, platelet and white cell counts were associated with better odds of survival. Clinical Significance Infectious diseases appear to be the leading causes of canine pancytopoenia in endemic areas; severe leukopoenia (ehrlichiosis, parvoviral enteritis), thrombocytopoenia (ehrlichiosis) and hypoproteinaemia (parvoviral enteritis), represented potentially useful disease-specific diagnostic determinants. The severity of pancytopoenia significantly affects the clinical outcome.

AB  - Summary Transfusion medicine must be practiced within a strict regulatory framework. Careful donor selection followed by stringent testing by the blood service is essential to ensure a safe blood supply. Whole blood is processed into its component parts including red cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate for clinical use. Donated blood is a limited resource and hospital transfusion practice must focus on ensuring safe and appropriate use within the principles of effective Patient Blood Management (PBM) with implementation of clinical guidelines supported by education, training and regular audit. Robust systems are essential for accurate patient identification throughout the transfusion process and including the final bedside check to minimize errors. Haemovigilance with the reporting of adverse events and feedback of lessons learnt has greatly helped improve transfusion safety.

AB  - Summary Exotic small mammals such as ferrets, rabbits, and rodents are popular companion animals. Given the paucity of information in the veterinary literature pertaining to transfusion medicine in exotic species, common principles of blood transfusion medicine and blood substitute therapy in mammals such as dogs and cats can sometimes be extrapolated to exotic small mammals. Blood transfusions are generally indicated to replace a deficiency of blood constituents such as red blood cells (RBCs), plasma, clotting factors, and platelets. Crossmatches are agglutination and hemolysis tests performed to assess donor-recipient compatibility, observing interactions between the donor and recipient RBCs and antibodies contained in the plasma. Blood banking is a common method of storage for feline and canine blood products, but it is not commonly practiced for exotic small mammals. Much of the information available is based on clinical experience and extrapolation from human, canine, and feline patients.

AB  - Background and Objectives? Continuous monitoring of blood use and feedback on transfusions are effective in decreasing inappropriate blood transfusions. However, traditional methods of monitoring have practical challenges, such as the limited availability of experts and funding. Administrative data including a patient classification system may be employed for risk-adjusted assessment of hospital-wide blood use. Materials and Methods? We conducted an audit of blood use at two hospitals and determined proportions of appropriate blood use at each hospital. We then used administrative data of 587?045 cases provided by 73 hospitals to develop two mathematical models to calculate risk-adjusted use of blood products. The first model is a logistic regression model to predict the percentage of transfused patients. Patient demographics, surgery and diagnostic groups were utilized as predictors of transfusion. The second model is a case-mix adjusted model which predicts hospital-wide use of units of blood products from the distribution of diagnosis-related groups. For each model, the observed to expected (O/E) ratio of blood use in each hospital was calculated. We compared resultant ratios with proportions of appropriate blood use in two of the hospitals studied. Results? Both models showed good prediction abilities. O/E ratios calculated using the two models were relevant to proportions of appropriate transfusions. Conclusions? Risk-adjusted assessments of blood product use based on administrative data allow hospital-wide evaluation of transfusion use. Comparing blood use between different hospitals contributes toward establishing appropriate transfusion practices.

AB  - Wounding always provokes bleeding that leads to a complicated process of hemostasis that stops the loss of blood and initiates the healing response in the tissue. In the primary hemostasis, vasoconstriction limits the blood loss and platelets stick to exposed collagen, become activated and aggregate to form the soft plug. The coagulation process that follows operates on different cell surfaces where extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways operate in parallel leading to formation and stabilization of the fibrin clot. In this review, we will summarize the current understanding of the hemostasis process and coagulation and discuss the clinical issues involved in management of bleeding problems.

AB  - Summary Coagulation and innate immunity are linked evolutionary processes that orchestrate the host defence against invading pathogens and injury. The complement system is integral to innate immunity and shares numerous interactions with components of the haemostatic pathway, helping to maintain physiological equilibrium. The term ?immunothrombosis? was introduced in 2013 to embrace this process, and has become an area of much recent interest. What is less apparent in the literature however is an appreciation of the clinical manifestations of the coagulation-complement interaction and the consequences of dysregulation of either system, as seen in many inflammatory and thrombotic disease states, such as sepsis, trauma, atherosclerosis, antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) and some thrombotic microangiopathies to name a few. The growing appreciation of this immunothrombotic phenomenon will foster the drive for novel therapies in these disease states, including anticoagulants as immunomodulators and targeted molecular therapies.

Simple rules need to be considered when defining the care strategy for these patients. Simple rules: ?? Establish at pre-hospital care and delivery system ?? Recognize the ?at risk? patient or injury pattern ?? Rule out and/or account for other major sources of bleeding ?? Control other sources of bleeding, if possible ?? Resuscitate to a ?tolerable? blood pressure ?? Blood product replacement: RBCs, platelets and FFP ?? Provisionally stabilize the pelvis ?? pelvic binder or sheet ?? ipsilateral femoral traction, in some cases ?? Emergent external fixation? ?? Stop arterial bleeding ?? Angiography and selective embolization ?? Exploration and direct pelvic gutter packing ?? Don?t be fooled by a positive FAST from an extra-peritoneal bladder rupture ?? an ex-lap for a retroperitoneal bleed can be fatal ?? To the TICU for continued resuscitation ??

AB  - Introduction? Trauma teams and cardiac arrest teams provide an urgent and expert multi-disciplinary response to time critical emergencies. The present study documents the contribution of a medical emergency team (MET) to managing non-trauma surgical emergencies. Materials and Methods? Data was prospectively collected over a two year period concerning the contribution of medical emergency teams to the resuscitation of all patients with non-trauma surgical emergencies and altered vital signs in hospital wards. Results? Over the study period, the details of 19 patients with surgical emergencies were recorded. 63% of emergencies occurred outside of normal working hours. In 53% of cases, the surgical registrar was off-site or physically unavailable to attend the emergency immediately. In 11% of cases, the medical emergency team was activated prior to the arrival of the surgical registrar. In 26% of cases, the patient was left unattended whilst awaiting arrival of the surgical registrar. The medical emergency team provided resuscitation procedures and arranged urgent investigations in all patients, physically transported the patient to the operating theatre in 16% of patients and prepared for general anaesthetic in the operating theatre in 11% of cases. The surgical registrar complemented the medical emergency team response by liaising with consultant surgeons, anaesthetists and operating theatre staff in all cases. All patients received definitive treatment within 30 minutes of MET response. Conclusion? Routine use of medical emergency teams in the initial resuscitation of patients with surgical emergencies expedites definitive management.

AB  - Background? Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a complex rescue therapy used to provide cardiac and/or respiratory support for critically ill patients who have failed maximal conventional medical management. ECMO is based on a modified cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit, and can provide cardiopulmonary support for up-to several months. It can be used in a veno venous configuration for isolated respiratory failure, (VV-ECMO), or in a veno arterial configuration (VA-ECMO) where support is necessary for cardiac +/- respiratory failure. The ECMO circuit consists of five main components: large bore cannulae (access cannulae) for drainage of the venous system, and return cannulae to either the venous ( in VV-ECMO) or arterial (in VA ECMO) system. An oxygenator, with a vast surface area of hollow filaments, allows addition of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide; a centrifugal blood pump allows propulsion of blood through the circuit at upto 10 L/minute; a control module and a thermoregulatory unit, which allows for exact temperature control of the extra corporeal blood. Methods? The first successful use of ECMO for ARDS in adults occurred in 1972, and its use has become more commonplace over the last 30 years, supported by the improvement in design and biocompatibility of the equipment, which has reduced the morbidity associated with this modality. Whilst the use of ECMO in neonatal population has been supported by numerous studies, the evidence upon which ECMO was integrated into adult practice was substantially less robust. Results? Recent data, including the CESAR study (Conventional Ventilatory Support versus Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation for Severe Respiratory failure)has added a degree of evidence to the role of ECMO in such a patient population. The CESAR study analysed 180 patients, and confirmed that ECMO was associated with an improved rate of survival. More recently, ECMO has been utilized in numerous situations within the critical care area, including support in high-risk percutaneous interventions in cardiac catheter lab; the operating room, emergency department, as well in specialized inter-hospital retrieval services. The increased understanding of the risk:benefit profile of ECMO, along with a reduction in morbidity associated with its use will doubtless lead to a substantial rise in the utilisation of this modality. As with all extra-corporeal circuits, ECMO opposes the basic premises of the mammalian inflammation and coagulation cascade where blood comes into foreign circulation, both these cascades are activated. Anti-coagulation is readily dealt with through use of agents such as heparin, but the inflammatory excess, whilst less macroscopically obvious, continues un-abated. Platelet consumption and neutrophil activation occur rapidly, and the clinician is faced with balancing the need of anticoagulation for the circuit, against haemostasis in an acutely bleeding patient. Alterations in pharmacokinetics may result in inadequate levels of disease modifying therapeutics, such as antibiotics, hence paradoxically delaying recovery from conditions such as pneumonia. Key elements of nutrition and the innate immune system may similarly be affected. Summary? This presentation will discuss the basic features of ECMO to the non-specialist, and review the clinical conundrum faced by the team treating these most complex cases.

AB  - Abstract Critically ill patients, not infrequently present alterations of physiological parameters that determine the success/failure of therapeutic interventions as well as the final outcome. Sepsis and polytrauma are two of the most common and complex syndromes occurring in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and affect drug absorption, disposition, metabolism and elimination. Pharmacological management of ICU patients requires consideration of the unique pharmacokinetics associated with these clinical conditions and the likely occurrence of drug interaction. Rational adjustment in drug choice and dosing contributes to the appropriateness of treatment of those patients.

AB  - SUMMARY Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) is a pivotal cytokine at the centre of a cascade of cytokines and inflammatory mediators which modulate the host response to infection and trauma, and in particular the metabolic changes resulting in shock and subsequent multi-organ failure. The cytokine IL-8?predominantly an activator and chemotactic factor for circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophil leucocytes?is produced in response to TNF-Î±in vitro, and high circulating levels of IL-8 are found in septic primates. We have studied the release of IL-8 into the circulation of subjects with chronic hepatitis B undergoing a 10 week pilot trial of recombinant TNF-Î± (rTNF-Î±) therapy in doses of 15-100 ?g/m2, A marked dose-dependent increase in plasma IL-8 levels was seen commencing at 30-60 min after the start of rTNF-Î± infusion and peaking between 2 and 3 h (mean peak level 4300 ng/l). The temporal pattern of IL-8 production exactly echoed that of IL-6, another component of the cytokine cascade, but peak plasma levels of IL-8 were up to 17 times higher than those of IL-6. This study confirms in vitro data suggesting that IL-8 is a component of the acute circulating cytokine cascade with a potential role in the modulation of the acute immune and metabolic response to infection and trauma.
