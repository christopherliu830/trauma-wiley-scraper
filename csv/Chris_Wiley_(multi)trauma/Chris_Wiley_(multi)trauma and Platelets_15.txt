AB  - Abstract Fracture healing is a well-organized process between several molecules and mediators. As known from other diseases, genetic polymorphisms may exhibit different expression patterns in these mediators. Concerning fracture healing, this may lead to an extended healing process or non-union. We investigated the incidence of polymorphisms in patients with aseptic non-unions after femoral and tibial shaft fractures as compared to patients with uneventful healing. Exclusion criteria were smoking, diabetes, bilateral fractures, systemic corticoid therapy, and septic non-unions. Analysis of allele frequencies and genotype distribution of various mediators were carried out following PCR. Clinical parameters such as injury severity and in-hospital were analyzed. Fifty patients following non-union (group NU) were enrolled, the control group consisted of 44 patients (group H). A significant association of a PDGF haplotype and non-unions following fracture could be observed. There was a significantly increased in-hospital time and amount of surgical procedures in group NU. Polymorphisms within the PDGF gene seem to be a genetic risk factor for the development of non-unions of the lower extremity following fracture. The early identification of high risk patients could result in an adapted therapeutical strategy and might contribute to a significant decrease of posttraumatic non-unions. ? 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - A 9-year-old, female neutered Dalmatian was evaluated for acute onset of dyspnoea. Thoracocentesis on presentation yielded 1300 ml sanguineous fluid, while thoracic radiology and ultrasonography showed a mixed-echoic cavitary cranial mediastinal mass, sternal lymph node enlargement and pleural effusion. Surgical exploration of the thorax revealed a multi-lobulated red/brown cranial mediastinal mass and multiple similarly coloured ovoid nodules within several lung lobes. Histopathology revealed thymic branchial cysts with neoplastic transformation and examination of the lung was consistent with metastasis. Despite initially recovering well, acute sepsis and pyothorax resulted in cardiac arrest 8 days postoperatively. This is the first veterinary report of neoplastic transformation of a thymic branchial cyst with pulmonary metastasis.

AB  - Abstract: The blood-contacting surface, mainly composed of polycarbonate, of the Gyro C1E3 pump was modified using plasma glow discharge to introduce a carboxyl functional group, coated with a base layer of polyethyleneimine as a linker, and coupled with heparin by multi-ionic binding to enhance blood compatibility. A relative surface content of 3.7% sulfur, which demonstrated heparin immobilization on the polycarbonate substrate, was observed on x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and a initial bioactivity of approximately 88.5 ± 7.3 mIU/cm2 was obtained by the chromogenic method for antifactor Xa assay. Furthermore, in vitro observation of platelet and fibrin adherence using bovine blood under dynamic flow conditions for 6 h revealed that the multi-ionically heparinized Gyro C1E3 had significantly stronger antithrombogenecity than the noncoated original type which was evaluated as a good hemocompatible blood pump for clinical use. Not only the Gyro C1E3 but also the ionically heparin-coated Gyro pump are expected to be thromboresistant in clinical use.

These include the identification and elimination of precipitating factors, in association with, or followed by, specific measures designed to reduce arterial ammonia levels. In many patients, liver transplantation may offer the only chance of effective management of this challenging clinical problem.

AB  - Abstract Clinical cellular therapeutics (CCTs) have shown preliminary efficacy in reducing inflammation after trauma, preserving cardiac function after myocardial infarction, and improving functional recovery after stroke. However, most clinically available cell lines express tissue factor (TF) which stimulates coagulation. We sought to define the degree of procoagulant activity of CCTs as related to TF expression. CCT samples from bone marrow, adipose, amniotic fluid, umbilical cord, multi-potent adult progenitor cell donors, and bone marrow mononuclear cells were tested. TF expression and phenotype were quantified using flow cytometry. Procoagulant activity of the CCTs was measured in vitro with thromboelastography and calibrated thrombogram. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) separated samples into high- and low-TF expressing populations to isolate the contribution of TF to coagulation. A TF neutralizing antibody was incubated with samples to demonstrate loss of procoagulant function. All CCTs tested expressed procoagulant activity that correlated with expression of tissue factor. Time to clot and thrombin formation decreased with increasing TF expression. High-TF expressing cells decreased clotting time more than low-TF expressing cells when isolated from a single donor using FACS. A TF neutralizing antibody restored clotting time to control values in some, but not all, CCT samples. CCTs demonstrate wide variability in procoagulant activity related to TF expression. Time to clot and thrombin formation decreases as TF load increases and this procoagulant effect is neutralized by a TF blocking antibody. Clinical trials using CCTs are in progress and TF expression may emerge as a safety release criterion. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2018;7:731?739

AB  - Gulf War illness (GWI) is a currently untreatable multi-symptom disorder experienced by 1990?1991 Persian Gulf War (GW) veterans. The characteristic hallmarks of GWI include cognitive dysfunction, tremors, migraine, and psychological disturbances such as depression and anxiety. Meta-analyses of epidemiological studies have consistently linked these symptomatic profiles to the combined exposure of GW agents such as organophosphate-based and pyrethroid-based pesticides (e.g. chlorpyrifos (CPF) and permethrin (PER) respectively) and the prophylactic use of pyridostigmine bromide (PB) as a treatment against neurotoxins. Due to the multi-symptomatic presentation of this illness and the lack of available autopsy tissue from GWI patients, very little is currently known about the distinct early pathological profile implicated in GWI (including its influence on synaptic function and aspects of neurogenesis). In this study, we used preclinical models of GW agent exposure to investigate whether 6-month-old mice exposed to CPF alone, or a combined dose of CPF, PB and PER daily for 10 days, demonstrate any notable pathological changes in hippocampal, cortical (motor, piriform) or amygdalar morphometry. We report that at an acute post-exposure time point (after 3 days), both exposures resulted in the impairment of synaptic integrity (reducing synaptophysin levels) in the CA3 hippocampal region and altered neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus (DG), demonstrated by a significant reduction in doublecortin positive cells. Both exposures also significantly increased astrocytic GFAP immunoreactivity in the piriform cortex, motor cortex and the basolateral amygdala and this was accompanied by an increase in (basal) brain acetylcholine (ACh) levels. There was no evidence of microglial activation or structural deterioration of principal neurons in these regions following exposure to CPF alone or in combination with PB and PER. Evidence of subtle microvascular injury was demonstrated by the reduction of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1 levels in CPF+PB+PER exposed group compared to control. These data support early (subtle) neurotoxic effects on the brain following exposure to GW agents.

AB  - The acute Page kidney phenomenon occurs as a consequence of external compression of the renal parenchyma leading to renal ischemia and hypertension. Between January 2000 and September 2007, 550 kidney transplants and 518 ultrasound-guided kidney biopsies were performed. During that time, four recipients developed acute oligo-anuria following ultrasound-guided allograft biopsy. Emergent doppler-ultrasounds were performed demonstrating absence of diastolic flow as well as a sub-capsular hematoma of the kidney. Prompt surgical exploration with allograft capsulotomy was performed in all cases. Immediately after capsulotomy, intraoperative Doppler study demonstrated robust return of diastolic flow. Three patients maintained good graft function, and one kidney was lost due to acute antibody-mediated rejection. We conclude that postbiopsy anuria associated with a subcapsular hematoma and acute absence of diastolic flow on doppler ultrasound should be considered pathognomonic of APK. All renal transplant specialists should be able to recognize this complication, because immediate surgical decompression can salvage the allograft.

AB  - Abstract Objectives.? The ongoing conflict in Afghanistan continues to generate a large number of complex trauma injuries and provides unique challenges to military anesthetists working in forward field hospitals. We report successful use of ultrasound-guided continuous transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block in two Afghan war casualties who sustained major trauma with coagulopathy. The use of bilateral continuous TAP blocks following major thoracoabdominal trauma in a combat environment is unique in the literature. Design.? Case report. Results.? The acute perioperative outcomes of two Afghan civilian patients were improved with bilateral continuous TAP blocks. Multiple benefits shared by both patients included early extubation, excellent analgesia, and minimal post-operative morphine requirements despite the setting of a massive blood transfusion and coagulopathy. Conclusions.? A continuous TAP block technique can be utilized to provide excellent analgesia following major abdominal surgery when neuraxial anesthesia is contraindicated. The TAP block's ease of placement under ultrasound guidance makes this technique particularly useful in the austere battlefield hospital environment.

AB  - Background To develop a screening tool to identify patients at risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) within 24?h of a patient's admission to intensive care unit (ICU). Methods Prospective, observational study of 403 consecutively enrolled patients with an indwelling catheter, admitted to a mixed medical-surgical ICU in a tertiary referral, university hospital. Intra-abdominal pressure was measured at least twice daily and IAH and ACS defined as per consensus definitions. Results Thirty-nine per cent of patients developed IAH and 2% developed ACS. Abdominal distension, hemoperitoneum/pneumoperitoneum/intra-peritoneal fluid collection, obesity, intravenous fluid received >?2.3?l, abbreviated Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score >?4 points and lactate >?1.4?mmol/l were identified as independent predictors of IAH upon admission to ICU. The presence of three or more of these risk factors at admission identified patients that would develop IAH with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 76%, the development of grades II, III and IV IAH with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 62%. Patients that developed IAH required a significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU care. Patients that developed grades II?IV IAH had a significantly higher rate of ICU mortality. Conclusion IAH is a common clinical entity in the intensive care setting that is associated with morbidity and mortality. A screening tool, based on data readily available within a patient's first 24?h in ICU, was developed and effectively identified patients that required intra-abdominal pressure monitoring.

This article reports a myeloproliferative disorder in a dog that was ultimately designated as MbL on the basis of the presence of circulating blast cells and thrombocythaemia, and of multi-organ infiltration and myelofibrosis. It comments on the difficulties of diagnosing such a condition and reviews previously published articles on MbL and ET in dogs and cats.

AB  - Donation after circulatory death (DCD) liver transplantation (LT) reportedly yields inferior survival and increased complication rates compared with donation after brain death (DBD). We compare 100 consecutive DCD LT using a protocol that includes thrombolytic therapy (late DCD group) to an historical DCD group (early DCD group n = 38) and a cohort of DBD LT recipients (DBD group n = 435). Late DCD LT recipients had better 1- and 3-year graft survival rates than early DCD LT recipients (92% vs. 76.3%, p = 0.03 and 91.4% vs. 73.7%, p = 0.01). Late DCD graft survival rates were comparable to those of the DBD group (92% vs. 93.3%, p = 0.24 and 91.4% vs. 88.2%, p = 0.62). Re-transplantation occurred in 18.4% versus 1% for the early and late DCD groups, respectively (p = 0.001). Patient survival was similar in all three groups. Ischemic-type biliary lesions (ITBL) occurred in 5%, 3%, and 0.2% for early DCD, late DCD, and DBD groups, respectively, but unlike in the early DCD group, in the late DCD group ITBL was endoscopically managed and resolved in each case. Using a protocol that includes a thrombolytic therapy, DCD LT yielded patient and graft survival rates comparable to DBD LT.

AB  - Summary Recently several parameters have been introduced to the complete blood count such as nucleated red blood cells, immature granulocytes; immature reticulocyte fraction, immature platelet fraction and red cell fragments as well as new parameters for detection of functional iron deficiency. Leucocyte positional parameters, which may diagnose specific diseases (e.g. differentiate between abnormal lymphocytes in leukaemia and viral conditions and may also detect malarial infection) are now available. At this time they are only used for research; however, generally such parameters later become reportable. One manufacturer?s routine analyser allows measurement of cells by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies. Currently, there are no accredited external quality assessment schemes (EQAS) for these parameters. For a number of parameters, on some instruments, there is no internal quality control, which brings into question whether these parameters should be used for clinical decision making. Other more established parameters, such as mean platelet volume, red cell distribution width and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate do not have EQAS available. The UK National EQAS for General Haematology held a workshop earlier this year in 2008 to discuss these parameters. Participants were asked to provide a consensus opinion on which parameters are the most important for inclusion in future haematology EQAS.

AB  - Purpose? The comprehensive describtion of the epidemiology of pelvic ring fractures (PRF) including high-energy PRF, low-energy PRF and those who die during the prehospital phase (pre-H). Methods? 12-month prospective population based study was performed in a trauma system with one Level-1 trauma centre and seven referring hospitals (population: 0.6 million). Data were collected on all PRF from the trauma system including high-energy, low energy fractures and pre-H deaths with PRF. Patient demographics, injury severity score (ISS), mortality (%) and PRF-related mortality were recorded prospectively. All high-energy deaths had autopsy at the same forensic pathology department. Data presented as percentages (%) or mean +/? SEM. Results? During the 12-month period 138 patients suffered PRF (45% male, 59+/?2 years, ISS 20+/?2, 21% mortality and 8% PRF-related mortality). Sixty-four % of the low-energy and 92% of the high-energy patients were transferred directly to the trauma center. There were 57 high-energy (71% male, 41+/?3 years, ISS 23+/?3, 14% mortality, 7% PRF-related mortality) 63 low-energy (20% male, 81+/?1 years, ISS 6+/?1, 5% mortality, 2% PRF-related mortality) and 18 pre-H died patients with PRF (47% male, 41+/?6 years, ISS 61+/?4, 100% mortality, 33% PRF-related mortality). PRF-related mortality was always due to bleeding. Conclusions? The majority of PRF-related mortality occurs pre-H. Half of the multiple-injured high-energy PRF patients still die because of the pelvic bleeding. Further preventive measures and optimization of the care of PRF patients is required. Trauma centre admission of 2/3 of the low-energy PRF is a significant load and should be further investigated in an inclusive trauma system.

AB  - Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a severe complication after liver transplantation that can result in increased morbidity and mortality. Few data are available regarding risk factors, classification, and treatment of PVT after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Between January 2004 and November 2014, 421 adult-to-adult LDLTs were performed at our institution, and they were included in the analysis. Perioperative characteristics and outcomes from patients with no-PVT (n = 393) were compared with those with de novo PVT (total portal vein thrombosis [t-PVT]; n = 28). Ten patients had early portal vein thrombosis (e-PVT) occurring within 1 month, and 18 patients had late portal vein thrombosis (l-PVT) appearing later than 1 month after LDLT. Analysis of perioperative variables determined that splenectomy was associated with t-PVT (hazard ratio [HR], 3.55; P = 0.01), e-PVT (HR, 4.96; P = 0.04), and l-PVT (HR, 3.84; P = 0.03). In contrast, donor age was only found as a risk factor for l-PVT (HR, 1.05; P = 0.01). Salvage rate for treatment in e-PVT and l-PVT was 100% and 50%, respectively, without having an early event of rethrombosis. Mortality within 30 days did not show a significant difference between groups (no-PVT, 2% versus e-PVT, 10%; P = 0.15). No significant differences were found regarding 1-year (89% versus 92%), 5-year (79% versus 82%), and 10-year (69% versus 79%) graft survival between the t-PVT and no-PVT groups, respectively (P = 0.24). The 1-year (89% versus 96%), 5-year (82% versus 86%), and 10-year (79% versus 83%) patient survival was similar for the patients in the no-PVT and t-PVT groups, respectively (P = 0.70). No cases of graft loss occurred as a direct consequence of PVT. In conclusion, the early diagnosis and management of PVT after LDLT can lead to acceptable early and longterm results without affecting patient and graft survival.

AB  - Abstract Colloids have been used for many years in resuscitation yet few studies have thoroughly examined their usefulness. Colloids and a combination of crystalloids and colloids continue to be used without any real scientific basis. Scrutiny of review articles, experimental studies, and clinical investigations reveals conflicting and confusing data. There are too many variables to accurately interpret findings, cross species problems with animal studies, different fluids used making comparisons difficult if not impossible, and confounding variables that include: 1 Health status of the patients 2 Severity/type of injury 3 Complications (especially sepsis) 4 Varying grades of shock 5 Variable time scale of administration of fluids 6 Variable volumes administered 7 Differing methods of determining fluid volume depletion 8 Inconsistent monitoring 9 Differing endpoints 10 Different techniques to measure endpoints 11 Comparison of delayed treatment of traumatic shock with blood loss occurring during surgery of questionable validity. One of the areas that has been studied reasonably well is the allergic effects associated with colloid use and more recently the adverse effects associated with the use of dextrose solutions in patients with head injuries. The continued effort to develop satisfactory resuscitation solutions including the recent development of hypertonic saline solutions (usually in combination with a colloid) highlights the uncertainty that exists in relation to the true role of the colloid and crystalloid agents available. Recent studies question the use of fluids to resuscitate patients with penetrating torso injuries. The aim of this paper is to review what is known about the use of colloids and crystalloids in resuscitation and to recommend guidelines as to which fluid should be used in differing clinical situations.

AB  - Aim Plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer have been reported to predict survival in several types of malignancies. The aim of this study is to investigate their predictive value in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods We retrospectively analyzed plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer levels from 252 subjects: control (n?=?20), hepatitis (n?=?20), cirrhosis (n?=?20), and HCC (n?=?192) subjects. The clinical involvement and prognostic value of fibrinogen and D-dimer was analyzed in HCC subjects. To confirm the effects of tumor on hypercoagulability and fibrinolysis, fibrinogen and D-dimer levels were measured in nude mice following HCC inoculation. Results Fibrinogen decreased and D-dimer increased in cirrhosis subjects relative to other groups. In HCC subjects, elevated fibrinogen and D-dimer levels were significantly associated with adverse tumor features (increased size, stage, and grade) and systemic inflammation. Patients with HCC with either elevated fibrinogen or D-dimer levels had significantly higher 3-year tumor recurrence rates (65% vs. 41%, P?< 0.001 for fibrinogen; 67% vs. 40%, P?=?0.011 for D-dimer) and significantly lower 3-year overall survival rates (57% vs. 79%, P?< 0.001 for fibrinogen; 56% vs. 80%, P?=?0.001 for D-dimer). After multivariate analysis, elevated fibrinogen levels remained an independent predictor of poor prognosis in HCC patients. Finally, elevated levels of fibrinogen and D-dimer were confirmed in nude mice following tumor inoculation. Conclusion The fibrinogen and D-dimer levels, elevating after carcinogenesis, may serve as simple but effective predictors of adverse tumor profiles and outcomes in HCC.

AB  - Objective To report the complications and outcome of dogs undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for uncomplicated gall bladder disease. Study Design Multi-institutional case series. Animals Client-owned dogs (n=20). Methods Medical records of dogs that underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy were reviewed and signalment, history, clinical and ultrasound examination findings, surgical variables, and complications were collated. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed using a multiport approach. Data were compared between dogs with successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy and dogs requiring conversion to open cholecystectomy. Results Six dogs (30%) required conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy due to inability to ligate the cystic duct (3), evidence of gall bladder rupture (1), leakage from the cystic duct during dissection (1), and cardiac arrest (1). Cystic duct dissection was performed in 19 dogs using an articulating dissector (10), right angle forceps (7), and unrecorded (2). The cystic duct was ligated in 15 dogs using surgical clips (5), suture (6), or a combination (4). All dogs were discharged from the hospital and had resolution of clinical signs, although 1 dog developed pancreatitis and 1 dog required revision surgery for bile peritonitis. There was no significant difference in preoperative blood analysis results, surgical technique, or duration of hospitalization between dogs undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and cases converted to open cholecystectomy. Conclusion Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed successfully for uncomplicated gall bladder disease in dogs after careful case selection. The surgeon considering laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be familiar with a variety of methods for cystic duct dissection and ligation to avoid difficulties during the procedure.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The Australian and New Zealand Haemostasis Registry (ANZHR) included patients who received off-licence recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) for critical bleeding from 2000 to 2009. Approximately 1.3% of the ANZHR patients were Jehovah's Witnesses (JWs). We compared them with the non-JW patients in the registry. Methods Patient characteristics (e.g. gender, context of bleeding), factors influencing rFVIIa use (e.g. body temperature and pH) and outcomes (e.g. bleeding response (stopped/attenuated or unchanged) to rFVIIa, mortality) were compared between JW and non-JW patients using Fisher's exact chi-square tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results A total of 42 JW and 3134 non-JW patients were included in the analysis. Approximately 99% (n = 3098) of non-JWs received blood products compared with only 30% (n = 13) of JWs (P < 0.01). The distribution of gender and contexts of critical bleeding in the two groups was significantly different. Approximately 17% of the non-JW patients were hypothermic (T < 35°C) and about 19% were acidotic (pH < 7.2) at the time of initial rFVIIa administration. Conversely, none of the JWs were hypothermic and only one was acidotic. The proportion of positive responders to rFVIIa (stopped/attenuated bleeding following rFVIIa use) was similar in both groups (75% non-JWs, 74% JWs; P = 1.0). Approximately 28% of non-JW and 17% of JW patients were deceased by day 28 following rFVIIa use (P = 0.16). Discussion Several factors were observed to be significantly different between JW and non-JW patients, yet the proportions of responders to rFVIIa were similar in both groups. The actual factors influencing response to rFVIIa are yet to be determined.
