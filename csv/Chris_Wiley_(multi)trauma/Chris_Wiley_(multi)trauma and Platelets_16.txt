AB  - Though first introduced more than 130 years ago, the concept of stress diabetes or stress hyperglycemia has gained tremendous attention in recent years in view of the landmark article by van den Berghe and colleagues in 2001. As opposed to earlier work that suggested that hyperglycemia in the acute clinical setting may be beneficial, it now appears that lower glucose levels are associated with improved outcomes. The mechanisms behind the improved outcomes are numerous and seem to be tied to the inflammatory process. Both lower glucose values and insulin therapy seem to be anti-inflammatory, whereas hyperglycemia increases the proinflammatory process and negatively affects the innate immune system. Despite the numerous approaches to achieve normoglycemia described in the literature, only modest success has been achieved. Understanding the pathophysiology driving stress hyperglycemia?the stress response and modulation of the inflammatory process?seems to be the key to improving the care of the most critically ill and injured patients.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background The antiplatelet drugs, aspirin and clopidogrel, are widely prescribed for cardiovascular and neurovascular diseases. It is recommended that these drugs should be ceased 5 days prior to elective surgery. If patients on these drugs require emergency non-cardiac surgery, the peri-operative risk of haemorrhage and thrombosis causes management dilemmas. Current guidelines are limited to the management of patients with coronary stents who are on antiplatelet drugs and require elective surgery. There is no universal evidence-based consensus, for the indications, method, timing or endpoints of treatment to reverse the antiplatelet action of clopidogrel in patients requiring emergency non-cardiac surgery. Aim To report two cases where emergency abdominal surgery was required in patients on concomitant clopidogrel and aspirin. Clinical details and outcome Two patients who were on concomitant aspirin and clopidogrel required urgent abdominal surgery. The two cases were managed differently. In the first case, no pre-operative platelets or fresh frozen plasma were administered and surgery was complicated by major bleeding. The second patient received pre-operative platelet transfusion and encountered no significant bleeding or thrombotic complications. Conclusion There is an urgent need for the development of guidelines to manage patients receiving antiplatelet drugs requiring emergency non-cardiac surgery.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Decreased efficacy of veterinary antimicrobials and increased prevalence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) is of concern, but little is known of antimicrobial resistance encompassing the New Zealand (NZ) equine population. Recent concerns have arisen over the emergence of multi-resistant bacteria [1], especially on NZ stud farms where antibiotics are frequently used for respiratory disease without veterinary input [2]. Objectives To describe bacterial culture and antimicrobial sensitivity results from respiratory samples submitted of young horses (4 weeks to 3 years old). Study design Retrospective study of clinical pathology records. Methods A database search for isolates and sensitivity of respiratory samples from young horses (April 2004?July 2014) was conducted. The results of in vitro sensitivity testing by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion were tabulated for major bacterial species isolated. Multiple correspondence analysis was used to describe clustering of multi-drug resistance (MDR) and selected demographic variables. Results 237/289 eligible respiratory samples had at least one aerobic bacterial isolate. Most of the 774 bacterial isolates were Gram-positive (68%). Streptococcus species were the most common genus isolated (40% of isolates). Sensitivity of Streptococcus spp. to penicillin, gentamicin and ceftiofur was >85%, but only 53% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxone. Gram-negative sensitivity to ceftiofur, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxone was <75%. MDR was found for 16% of isolates and in 39% of horses. Conclusions Penicillin is an appropriate first-line antimicrobial for use in most NZ young horses with suspected bacterial respiratory infection. However, based on findings of MDR, submission of samples for culture and monitoring of sensitivity should be used to inform antimicrobial selection. Ethical animal research:?Not applicable. Sources of funding:?Massey University McGeorge Fund; New Zealand Equine Research Foundation. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Summary Studies investigating the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of surgical-site hemorrhage after kidney transplantation are limited. Patients who underwent a kidney transplant from 1 January 2000 to 30 September 2012 (followed until 31 December 2012) at Toronto General Hospital were included in this study. Postoperative surgical-site hemorrhage was defined as a drop in hemoglobin ≥20 g/l over a 24-hour period within 3 days of transplantation, followed by an ultrasound indicating a significant hematoma/collection. A total of 59 of 1203 (4.9%) kidney transplant recipients had postoperative surgical-site hemorrhage. Most cases (89.8%) occurred within 1 day after transplantation. Living donor transplants [OR 0.30 (95% CI: 0.16, 0.55)] and higher recipient BMI [OR 0.54 per 10 kg/m2 increase in BMI (95% CI: 0.30, 0.99)] were associated with a significantly lower risk of bleeding. Chronic preoperative anticoagulant usage led to an increased risk of bleeding but was not statistically significant [OR 1.75 (95% CI: 0.52, 5.88)]. Postoperative hemorrhage was associated with a higher risk of graft loss or death [HR 1.62 (95% CI: 1.01, 2.60)]. While the incidence of postoperative surgical-site hemorrhage in kidney transplantation is relatively low, it may be associated with an increased risk of graft loss or death.

AB  - Abstract Isolated pig hearts, subsequently perfused with pig or human blood, were prepared for the cytochemical demonstration of sites of hydrogen peroxide generation and increased vascular permeability. Oxidant stress was associated with ultrastructural changes commonly seen following myocardial reperfusion. In addition, the precipitation of cerium perhydroxide following perfusion with physiological saline containing cerium chloride suggested the vascular endothelium and leukocytes as sources of oxidants. This was associated with rapid penetration of horseradish peroxidase through the intercellular clefts of the vascular endothelium into the interstitial space, suggesting increased vascular leakiness at these sites. The rapid penetration of horseradish peroxidase was observed at all monitored periods of reperfusion with pig or human blood. This indicates that the increased permeability occurred during the ischaemic period and continued during reperfusion. Morphological damage was greatest in pig hearts reperfused with whole human blood and this was attenuated if the blood was preabsorbed to remove antibodies prior to reperfusion. We conclude that oxidant stress was initiated during ischaemia and continued during reperfusion in this model. Microsc. Res. Tech. 42:369?385, 1998. ? 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?When life-threatening bleeding occurs in patients on warfarin, timely reversal becomes imperative. In the USA, warfarin effect is commonly reversed with fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The use of FFP is complicated by delays in correction, volume overload and often, inadequate correction. Objective:?Evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a protocol for rapid administration of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) in the setting of the urgent need for reversal of warfarin. Methods/patients:?We instituted a policy for rapid delivery and administration of PCC. Appropriate patients received 25?50?U?kg?1 of PCC. The prothrombin time (PT)/International Normalized Ratios (INR) was recorded before and immediately after dosing, and 24?h postdosing. Patients requiring surgical interventions were cleared for the operating room (OR) immediately. Fifty-eight patients were treated, with a median age of 75.5?years (range 26?92). Results:?The median INR on presentation was 3.8 (1.4?52.8). Immediately following PCC administration the median INR was 1.3 (0.9?5.7), only two patients with INRs exceeding 2.0. The benefit was maintained at 24?h with a median INR of 1.5 (1.1?3.4). Four patients experienced thrombotic events during their hospitalization, (two deep vein thrombosis, two non-q-wave myocardial infarction) although none was attributed to PPC therapy. Conclusions:?PCC administration is an effective treatment modality for the correction of warfarin anticoagulation in the urgent setting. Advantages over FFP include more timely correction, absence of volume overload and potentially more complete correction. Broader use of PCC in this setting appears to be appropriate.

Their relative lack of immunogenicity, autologous properties, and comparatively inexpensive nature has recently given them much attention. Platelet-rich plasma, autologous fibroblast cell therapy, and adipose-derived stem cells have each shown promising results in facial recontouring and rejuvenation. Their recent introduction into the field of cosmetic dermatology has shifted the focus towards a new direction, with more treatment options available to practitioners while decreasing the adverse events.

AB  - Summary Splenectomy is performed for primary or, less frequently, metastatic malignant tumors, spleen torsion, splenomegaly associated to infiltrative disease, traumatic rupture, and immune-mediated diseases. Splenectomy may be performed as 'open surgery' or laparoscopically. The most common early complication of splenectomy is hemorrhage, associated or not with hemostatic abnormalities. Early complications also include damage to the left pancreatic lobe and gastric wall because of devascularization and acute infection. Arrhythmias are abnormal rhythms of the heart, causing a less effective cardiac output. Arrhythmias, usually in form of rapid ventricular tachycardia or multifocal ventricular arrhythmia, are reported in dogs undergoing splenectomy for malignant tumors, torsion, and benign splenomegaly. Continuous monitoring is acceptable when neither significant pulse deficit nor clinical signs are evident. Only symptomatic dogs with no perceptible femoral pulse, multifocal ventricular arrhythmia or tachycardia, and hypoperfusion or preexisting cardiac disease should receive medical therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND Central venous catheters are frequently inserted into patients with coagulation disorders. It is unclear whether preprocedural correction of hemostasis is beneficial. We determined the incidence of bleeding complications after central venous catheter placement in patients who had severe coagulopathy and identified potential risk factors for bleeding. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The MEDLINE and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched through November 2015. To be included, articles must have reported on hemorrhagic complications with specification of abnormal coagulation testing results. Severe coagulopathy was defined as a reduced platelet count of 50 ? 109/L or less, and/or an elevated international normalized ratio of 1.5 or greater, and/or a partial thromboplastin time of 45 seconds or greater. RESULTS We included one randomized controlled trial and 21 observational studies. In total, there were 13,256 catheter insertions, including 4213 in patients with severe coagulopathy. Before 3150 central venous catheter placements, coagulopathy was not corrected. The bleeding incidence varied from 0 to 32%. The severity of coagulopathy did not predict the risk of bleeding. No study demonstrated a beneficial effect from the prophylactic administration of platelets or fresh-frozen plasma to prevent bleeding complications. Retrospective observational studies suggested that no preprocedural correction is required up to a platelet count of 20 ? 109/L and an international normalized ratio of 3.0. CONCLUSION The incidence of major bleeding complications after central venous catheter placement is low, even in coagulopathic patients. Based on a systematic research of the literature, strong evidence supporting the correction of hemostatic defects before central venous catheter insertion is lacking. However, well-powered randomized controlled trials will be necessary to determine the minimal platelet count, the maximal international normalized ratio, and an activated partial thromboplastin time that is safe before central venous catheter insertion.

This complex process requires an organized approach and a thorough understanding of ventilator management and ECMO physiology. The purpose of this article is to describe the venovenous ECMO weaning protocol used at our institution as well as provide a review of the literature.

AB  - SUMMARY Objective To describe the epidemiology of blood transfusion in children: including the incidence of transfusion, the diagnoses leading to transfusion, donor exposure (DE) and post-transfusion survival. Study design and methods The Epidemiology and Survival of Transfusion Recipients (EASTR) Study was a multi-centre epidemiological study with prospective survival monitoring. Cross-sectional sampling of adult and paediatric transfusion recipients in 29 hospitals was used to select three separate cohorts of red cell (RBC), platelet (PLT) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) recipients between October 2001 and September 2002. This paper presents the analysis of results for children <16 years. Results Children <16 years comprised 449 (5%) of the RBC, 362 (9%) of the FFP and 452 (13%) of the PLT recipients. In children 54% of RBC, 63% FFP and 45% PLT recipients were under 1 year of age and 57% RBC, 60% FFP and 52% PLT were male. Median (IQR) DEduring the study year was 3(2?8); 5(2?13) and 11(6?21) in the RBC, FFP and PLT cohorts, respectively. A total of 20% of RBC, 31% of FFP and 54% of PLT recipients had been exposed to >10 donors. Perinatal conditions were the commonest indication for transfusion in the RBC (36%) and FFP (44%) cohorts and comprised 31% of the PLT cohort. Medical conditions (48%), predominantly malignancy (33%), were the most frequent indication in the PLT cohort. The 10 year (95% CI) survival rates were 81% (77?85%), 72% (67?76%) and 71% (66?75%)for RBC, FFP and PLT cohorts, respectively. Conclusions Around half of paediatric transfusion recipients are under 1 year of age. Exposure to components from multiple donors is common. At least 70% of paediatric recipients are long survivors and are at risk for late complications of transfusion.

AB  - Abstract Background: Ultrastructural findings of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) include myocyte atrophy and myofilament loss, yet little is known about the vascular abnormalities present in IDCM. Methods and results: Patients with IDCM and controls underwent multi-slice CT to examine length and diameter of epicardial vasculature. The levels of mobilizing cytokines and circulating EPCs were assessed by endothelial colony formation assay and flow cytometry. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to examine microvessel density and expression of HIF-1α and ?-catenin. Main epicardial coronary arteries were shorter and smaller, and microvascular density was reduced in the epicardium in IDCM. Epicardial vessel paucity was associated with increased numbers of HIF-1α+ cells (46.8±13.1% vs. 19.4±9.4%, p=0.006) indicating local epicardial hypoxia and elevation of circulating VEGF-A (394pg/mL vs. 22pg/mL, p=0.001). The number of mobilized progenitors CD133+/VEGF-R2+ was 21-fold higher in IDCM compared with controls (6.5±3.3% vs. 0.3±0.2%; p<0.001). Moreover, this defective vascularization was associated with reduced myocardial expression of vascular ?-catenin, an important angiogenic regulator. Conclusions: This study shows defective vascularization and impaired vasculogenesis (the de novo vascular organization of mobilized endothelial progenitors) and angiogenesis (by which new blood vessels are formed from pre-existing mature endothelial cells) in human IDCM.

AB  - Background There continues to be uncertainty about the optimal approach to documenting bleeding data in platelet transfusion trials, with a desire to apply a common assessment tool across all trials. With this in mind, a consensus bleeding assessment tool (BAT) has been developed by the Biomedical Excellence for Safer Transfusion (BEST) collaborative, based on review of data collection forms used in published randomized trials and following content validation with a range of healthcare professionals at seven haematology centres through BEST members. This study aimed to evaluate reliability and reproducibility of the consensus BAT. Methods Replicated clinical assessments of bleeding were undertaken by participants with haematological malignancies recruited at four haematology centres in an international, multicentred, observational study. Concordance of repeat assessments was calculated for agreement in site and grade of bleeding observed. Results Forty patients consented to participate, and 13 trained bleeding assessors collected these data. Bleeding assessments were carried out on 113 separate days. Of all 225 bleeding assessments, 204 were compared for grade concordance, and 160 were compared for site concordance. There was very good grade concordance (83%, 95% confidence interval 74?93%) and good bleeding site concordance (69%, 95% confidence interval 57?79%) in observations of bleeding. Discordance was primarily in relation to assessing skin bleeding. Conclusions Alongside a structured training programme, levels of concordance for a consensus BAT were high. Researchers using assessment tools for bleeding need to balance comprehensive data collection against potential loss of accuracy for some types of bleeding, such as skin findings.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objective Although laser angioplasty has been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of long, complex coronary arterial atherosclerotic stenoses, there is an associated risk of acute arterial spasm, dissection, and perforation as well as a significant restenosis rate. It has been postulated that the use of lasers emitting at wavelengths designed for radiation absorption by water would decrease local tissue trauma. Study Design/Materials and Methods We have examined the use of a Nd:YAG laser designed to emit at 1.44 ?m, an absorption peak for water, and compared the results of laser ablation at 1.06 ?m, 1.32 ?m, and 1.44 ?m wavelengths. Nd:YAG laser angioplasty was performed in the abdominal aorta of White Leghorn roosters. Acute and chronic vascular trauma was assessed by contrast angiography and histological analysis. Results There was a significant decrease in early mortality with 1.44 ?m laser ablation. This decreased mortality after 1.44 ?m ablation was associated with a decrease in vascular spasm, perforation, and thermal damage. Atherosclerotic plaque development at follow up was decreased with 1.44 ?m ablation but this was not significant. Conclusion 1.44 ?m laser ablation decreases early vascular trauma and mortality and may decrease subsequent atherosclerotic plaque development. ? 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The objective of this study is to report the use of thromboelastography as a diagnostic tool for the hyperfibrinolytic phase of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in a dog with metastatic haemangiosarcoma. We established a cytological (i.e. fine needle aspirate) and histopathological (i.e. excisional surgical biopsy) diagnosis of haemangiosarcoma in a 10-year-old male castrated Bichon Frise with multiple dark purple dermoepidermal nodules on the ventral abdomen and medial stifle areas, multiple small pulmonary nodules and a solitary liver mass. The dog was treated with chemotherapy (AC protocol). Forty-nine days after completion of four treatment cycles, the dog was presented for recheck. Complete blood count revealed anaemia and mild thrombocytopenia. Chemistry profile showed no significant abnormalities. Analysis of haemostasis consisted of prolonged clotting times (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time), mild hypofibrinogenaemia and increased D-dimers. A presumptive diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy was made. A re-calcified thromboelastography was simultaneously done to confirm the coagulopathy. Thromboelastographic tracings correlated with the plasma-based test results showing hypocoagulability (prolonged clotting times and prolonged thromboelastography clot kinetics; weaker clot with decreased fibrinogen levels, platelet count and lower thromboelastography tracing amplitude) and hyperfibrinolysis (increased D-dimers and increased D-dimers and increased thromboelastography lysis parameters). Based on these results, the dog was considered to be in the hyperfibrinolytic phase of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Results of the conventional haemostasis tests supported those obtained on thromboelastography. Humane euthanasia was performed because of poor prognosis and progressive disease, making further follow-up unavailable. As demonstrated in this case report, thromboelastography was found to be a helpful diagnostic tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of the hyperfibrinolytic phases of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.

AB  - Abstract Sternal sepsis following median sternotomy is an infrequent yet devastating complication of cardiac surgery, leading to prolonged hospitalization, increased hospital expense, and a high associated morbidity and mortality. The development of sternotomy infection is multi-factorial. Numerous prospective and retrospective studies have pointed to a multitude of clinical and perioperative variables as being causative, with as many other studies presenting evidence to the contrary. This has led to confusion about which clinical variables should be modified so as to minimize the individual patient's risk for developing this severe complication. Other less obvious factors also come into play. Malnutrition, whether overt or subclinical, is not uncommon in cardiac patients. Immune competency is affected by operative trauma, as well as a variety of perioperative factors including underlying nutritional status, transfusion, cardiopulmonary bypass, and anesthesia. This creates a complex milieu for the development of postoperative infection. In this review, the multiple risk factors of median sternotomy infection are studied and treatment options briefly discussed.
