AB  - Abstract Despite the fact that neutrophils are essential for the protection from invading pathogens, hyperactive neutrophils may elicit detrimental cerebral damage after severe trauma. The neutrophil interactions with the neurovascular unit entail endothelial dysfunction involving endothelial leakage, formation of edema, coagulation abnormalities, disturbed hemodynamics, tissue infiltration etc. These elements of the ?whole body inflammation,? designated systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in conjunction with intracerebral proinflammatory activities, are important triggers of post-traumatic cerebral damage and mortality according to the ?second hit? concept. From the immunologic point of view, the brain is an immune privileged site, known to resist autodestructive inflammatory activity much more efficiently than other organs because of the highly efficient diverse functions of the blood?brain barrier (BBB). However, both the underlying strategy of the BBB to maintain cerebral protecting functions against the post-traumatic neutrophil-mediated ?second hit? and how activated neutrophils may overcome the BBB are currently unknown. Therefore, this review summarizes the current understanding of the ?second hit,? the BBB physiology, and its role in the maintenance of cerebral immune privilege, and discusses recent findings that may explain the pathophysiologic neutrophil?BBB interactions occurring after severe trauma, thus offering novel therapeutic options to protect from post-traumatic brain damage. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND Blood platelets (PLTs) are a valuable commodity. Management of their inventory has implications both for patient care and for the cost of health care delivery. There are a variety of different methods of managing PLT inventory currently in practice and multiple theoretical models aimed at improving PLT inventory metrics. In this study we evaluate the ability of a novel electronic dashboard system that monitors and displays both PLT inventory and patient data to improve transfusion metrics at a quaternary health care center. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The Capital District Health Authority is a quaternary health care center that transfuses approximately 2500 PLT units annually. To improve PLT discard rates a novel, low-overhead system that interfaces with the laboratory information system and displays real-time data between transfusion sites on PLT inventory and orders was implemented in November 2011. This study examines the transfusion quality metrics data from the 24 months before and after implementation. RESULTS A significant reduction in mean monthly PLT outdate rate was observed after the implementation of the PLT dashboard suite from 24.5% (n?=?24, SD?±?6.4%) to 15.1% (n?=?24, SD?±?6.4%; p?<?0.001). PLT age at time of transfusion was also reduced from 3.60 days (n?=?4796, SD?±?0.97 days) to 3.46 days (n?=?4881, SD?±?1.00 days; p?<?0.001). CONCLUSIONS This study describes the implementation of a novel PLT dashboard suite. This suite significantly reduced PLT outdate rates at our institution over the 48-month study period.

AB  - Abstract Background? Trauma is a leading cause of death and although the gut is recognized as the ?motor? of post-traumatic systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ failure, studies on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are few. Our objectives were to create a precisely controllable tissue injury model in which GI motility, systemic inflammation and wound fluid can be analyzed. Methods? A non-narcotic murine trauma model was developed by the subcutaneous dorsal trans-implantation of a devitalized donor syngeneic harvested tissue?bone matrix (TBX), which was precisely adjusted to % total body weight and studied after 21?h. Gastrointestinal transit histograms were plotted after the oral administration of non-digestible FITC-dextran and geometric centers calculated. Organ bath evaluated jejunal circular muscle contractility. Multiplex electrochemiluminescence measurements of serum and TBX wound fluid inflammatory mediators were performed. Key Results? Increasing TBX amounts progressively delayed transit, whereas TBX heat denaturation or decellularization prevented ileus and death. In the TBX17.5% model, jejunal muscle contractility was suppressed and a systemic inflammatory response developed as significant serum elevations in IL-6, keratinocyte cytokine and IL-10 compared to sham. In addition, inflammatory responses within the wound fluid showed elevated levels of preformed IL-1? and TNF-α, whereas, 21?h after implantation IL-1?, IL-6 and keratinocyte cytokine were significantly increased in the wound. Conclusions & Inferences? A novel donor tissue?bone matrix trauma model was developed that is precisely adjustable and recapitulates important clinical phenomena. The non-narcotic model demonstrated that increasing tissue injury progressively caused ileus, initiated a systemic inflammatory response and developed inflammatory changes within the wound.

AB  - About 50% of the trauma victims die at the scene mostly because of exsanguinating haemorrhage. Most trials of resuscitation fail in face of the ongoing bleeding. Ongoing research/studies to save these victims by inducing rapid hypothermia using cardiopulmonary bypass as an emergency initial measure along with delayed resuscitation show improved outcomes. A comprehensive review of this research and analysis of studies showed that rapid induction of hypothermia within 5 min of cardiac arrest is associated with better survival and improved neurological outcome. This led us to conclude that suspended animation is a lifesaving modality for the treatment of trauma victims, otherwise hurtling towards certain death. This should be integrated into regular clinical practice. The US Food and Drug Administration has given its approval for clinical trials on such an intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND The short shelf-life of fresh platelets limits their efficient inventory management and availability during a massive transfusion protocol. Risk of insufficient availability can be mitigated by building an inventory of cryopreserved platelets (CPs). METHODS A comparative study of fresh apheresis platelets (FAPs) and CPs was performed. Type-O CPs were processed with DMSO frozen at ?80°C and reconstituted in thawed AB plasma. All patients enrolled in the study had the following parameters evaluated on admission: vital signs (body temperature, heart rate, mean arterial pressure), blood count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen level, and, in trauma patients, international severity score. Several outcomes were evaluated: 30-day survival, adverse events, quantity of administered blood products, fibrinogen concentrate and thromboxane (TXA), and laboratory parameters after transfusion (blood count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen level). RESULTS Twenty-five (25) patients in the study group received transfusions totaling 81?units of CPs. Twenty-one (21) patients in the control group received a total of 67?units of FAPs. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics (p?>?0.05) between groups. Both groups were comparable in clinical outcomes (30-day survival, administered blood products, fibrinogen concentrate, TXA, and adverse events). Among posttransfusion laboratory parameters, platelet count was higher in the group transfused with FAPs (97.0 ?109/L) than in the group transfused with CPs (41.5 ?109/L), p?=?0.02025. Other parameters were comparable in both groups. CONCLUSION The study suggests that CPs are tolerable and a feasible alternative to FAPs. However, larger randomized studies are needed to draw definitive conclusions.

AB  - Abstract Conventional storage of platelet concentrates limits their shelf life to between 5 and 7 days due to the risk of bacterial proliferation and the development of the platelet storage lesion. Cold storage and cryopreservation of platelets may facilitate extension of the shelf life to weeks and years, and may also provide the benefit of being more haemostatically effective than conventionally stored platelets. Further, treatment of platelet concentrates with pathogen inactivation systems reduces bacterial contamination and provides a safeguard against the risk of emerging and re-emerging pathogens. While each of these alternative storage techniques is gaining traction individually, little work has been done to examine the effect of combining treatments in an effort to further improve product safety and minimize wastage. This review aims to discuss the benefits of alternative storage techniques and how they may be combined to alleviate the problems associated with conventional platelet storage.

AB  - Summary Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces blood loss by inhibiting the enzymatic breakdown of fibrin. It is often used in surgery to decrease bleeding and the need for blood transfusion. In 2011, results from a multi-center, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial (CRASH-2 trial) showed that TXA (1 g loading dose over 10 min followed by an infusion of 1 g over 8 h) safely reduces mortality in bleeding trauma patients. Initiation of TXA treatment within 3 h of injury reduces the risk of hemorrhage death by about one-third, regardless of baseline risk. Because it does not have any serious adverse effects, TXA can be administered to a wide spectrum of bleeding trauma patients. Limiting its use to the most severely injured or those with a diagnosis of ?hyperfibrinolysis? would result in thousands of avoidable deaths. A clinical trial (CRASH-3 trial) of TXA in patients with traumatic brain injury is now in progress.

AB  - Background Prehospital management of the traumatically injured patient has evolved significantly since the organization of emergency medical services across the United States in the 1970s. Initially focusing on the utilization of crystalloid solutions to restore shed blood volume, robust military and civilian trauma experiences led to a modern day shift towards balanced blood component and ultimately whole blood use for immediate volume replacement. In addition, prehospital transfusion or remote damage control resuscitation (RDRC) has been widely adopted. This has led to point of injury resuscitation using blood products both in the United States and abroad. Objectives This article will review the evolution of civilian and military prehospital resuscitation as well as the current practice of prehospital whole blood transfusion in the civilian trauma population in the United States. Additionally, we will provide an overview of our regional trauma system's use of whole blood with focus on the programme infrastructure, donor programme, product rotation schedule and logistical challenges. Finally, we provide three case report examples of the effective use of whole blood in our civilian emergency medical services (EMS) programs.

AB  - Abstract Penetrating thoracic trauma is relatively uncommon when compared to other types of veterinary trauma, although prompt identification and emergency evaluation are necessary as injuries may be life-threatening. Emergency triage (see Chapter 2) is prudent to ensure patient stabilization prior to pursuing additional diagnostics. Surgical exploration is likely indicated, particularly in cases of gunshot wounds or when patient comfort or stability is compromised by the degree of the injury. Resolution of hypovolemic shock, improving respiratory function, and analgesia are the key aspects of emergency room stabilization. Hemothorax and pneumothorax are common and thoracocentesis can be an important part of management of these patients. Outcome with treatment is generally fair to good, depending on the cause of the wound; however, particular situations (high-velocity gunshot wounds) have been shown to have a worse prognosis.

AB  - Summary. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to study the localization of platelet factor 4 (PF4), fibronectin (Fn) and factor VIII related antigen in washed normal platelets and those from patients with severe von Willebrand's disease (vWd). Platelets were prepared by an improved multi-unit modification of the Sayk chamber. This facilitated the preparation of samples with minimum disruption of platelets and readily permitted the demonstration of intact platelet granules by the immunological techniques used. The antigens were demonstrated by treating the same preparations sequentially with appropriate heterologous antisera and species specific fluorescein or rhodamine conjugated antisera. Comparison of the different antigens in identical platelets indicated that Fn and VIIIR:Ag were localized to the same granules as PF4 and the results were thus consistent with their presence in alpha granules. Fn and PF4, but not VIIIR:Ag, were present in platelet granules of patients with severe vWd. The antigens were always detected in the same granules, and major sub-populations of differently stained granules were not observed. The methods were applied to investigate normal platelets aggregated with collagen. Fn and VIIIR:Ag were detected in platelet granules after aggregation although the granules themselves were possibly differently distributed in these samples compared with the non-aggregated platelets. The localization of PF4 could not be reliably assessed in aggregated platelets by these methods. The techniques may be useful in localizing platelet antigens and studying release during aggregation.

AB  - Abstract Platelets are essential for maintaining vascular integrity. Given the anucleate nature of platelets, definition of their proteome is essential for understanding platelet pathophysiology. We describe here a detailed MS-based proteomic analysis of the platelet membrane/cytoskeletal sub-proteome from purified, normal, non-activated human platelets. In contrast to previous platelet proteomic purification strategies, the buffy-coat method was utilized in this study to isolate and purify minimally activated platelets, yielding significantly reduced contaminants for leukocytes (0.02?±?0.007?106/L) and erythrocytes (0.21?±?0.02%). Using a false discovery rate of 1%, 203 proteins were identified and characterized with respect to their subcellular localization, biological function, and cellular processes. Of these, 16 have not been identified in previous human platelet proteome studies. As a first approach towards understanding the dynamic platelet-plasma protein composition nexus, we re-analysed the entire HUPO plasma proteome project dataset (647 plasma proteins identified) and compared these data with our platelet proteome dataset. Co-identified proteins (41) were further analysed with respect to their relative abundances (exponentially modified protein abundance index) and functional enrichment in these two proteomes, as well as their correlation with the platelet transcriptome. Both platelet membrane/cytoskeletal and plasma proteome reference datasets, comprising both processed and unprocessed MS/MS spectra, are publicly accessible (http://www.ludwig.edu.au/archive/).

AB  - The use of fresh platelets has gained value in medicine as an essential part of wound treatments. This is not surprising since platelets contain a number of bioactive factors that contribute to the process of wound healing, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF). Fresh platelets? short shelf life limits platelet-based therapies. If platelets can be stabilized in freeze-dried form (FDP) then long-term storage as well as pathogen inactivation methods become possible. Adlyfe and Oregon Freeze-Dry have been developing technology to stabilize freeze-dried human platelets that can be subjected to gamma irradiation and stored for a long duration. Upon reconstitution, irradiated FDP retained growth factors PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, and TGF-B1 in quantities similar to fresh platelets as judged by capture ELISA. The rehydrated FDP promoted new DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation of primary human dermal fibroblasts and endothelial cells (HUVECs) similar to fresh platelets. The FDP also promoted remodeling of extracellular matrix by accelerating fibroblast-mediated contraction of collagen gels and stimulated HUVECs to undergo angiogenesis and form capillary structures in vitro. Therefore, we conclude that FDP and fresh platelets have comparable in vitro wound healing potential. Preclinical wound healing stud'ies in diabetic mice are under way and further development will allow FDP to be a safe and well-suited alternative to fresh platelets for wound healing applications.

AB  - SUMMARY Objectives To describe the ?Resuscitation with Pre-HospItaL bLood products? trial (RePHILL) ? a multi-centre randomised controlled trial of pre-hospital blood product (PHBP) administration vs standard care for traumatic haemorrhage. Background PHBP are increasingly used for pre-hospital trauma resuscitation despite a lack of robust evidence demonstrating superiority over crystalloids. Provision of PHBP carries additional logistical and regulatory implications, and requires a sustainable supply of universal blood components. Methods RePHILL is a multi-centre, two-arm, parallel group, open-label, phase III randomised controlled trial currently underway in the UK. Patients attended by a pre-hospital emergency medical team, with traumatic injury and hypotension (systolic blood pressure?<90?mmHg or absent radial pulse) believed to be due to traumatic haemorrhage are eligible. Exclusion criteria include age?<16?years, blood product receipt on scene prior to randomisation, Advanced Medical Directive forbidding blood product administration, pregnancy, isolated head injury and prisoners. A total of 490 patients will be recruited in a 1?: 1 ratio to receive either the intervention (up to two units of red blood cells and two units of lyophilised plasma) or the control (up to four boluses of 250?mL 0.9% saline). The primary outcome measure is a composite of failure to achieve lactate clearance of ≥20%/h over the first 2?hours after randomisation and all-cause mortality between recruitment and discharge from the primary receiving facility to non-acute care. Secondary outcomes include pre-hospital time, coagulation indices, in-hospital transfusion requirements and morbidity. Results Pilot study recruitment began in December 2016. Approval to proceed to the main trial was received in June 2017. Recruitment is expected to continue until 2020. Conclusions RePHILL will provide high-quality evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of PHBP resuscitation for trauma.

AB  - Summary. New methods are described for platelet isolation and buoyant density determination using low-speed centrifugation in continuous density gradients of Percoll. The conditions used do not induce loss of granule or cytoplasmic markers and enable reproducible platelet frequency distributions to be obtained in linear density gradients. Such frequency distributions are normal with a mode of 1·0645 ± 0·0015 g cm?3 (mean ± SD, n= 20). Platelets fixed in 0·1% glutaraldehyde show a modal density of 1·0712 ± 0·0005 g cm?3. Content of protein, lactate dehydrogenase, beta-thromboglobulin and 3H-serotonin correlate closely with platelet numbers throughout the density distribution. The frequency distribution of platelet volume between 2·2 and 21 fl fits a log normal model and cell volume in density subfractions from the most dense to the least dense also approximate log normality. There is a positive correlation between mean platelet volume and buoyant density with a small increment between the least and the most dense extremes. Platelet subfractions separated by volume using a FACS II cell sorter differ substantially from each other in cell volume but the difference in mean density of four different volume fractions is negligible. In discontinuous density gradients of Stractan factors other than platelet density must influence the separation of platelets, as rebanding of platelets from interfaces shows a wide variation in buoyant density when analysed in continuous gradients. It is concluded that analysis of platelet buoyant density in continuous Percoll gradients supports the view that platelet density, like platelet volume, is determined primarily during thrombocytopoiesis and that volume and density are largely independent elements of platelet heterogeneity.

AB  - Abstract The outcomes of posterolateral multilevel spine fusion in difficult clinical settings, such as in an aged multi-diseased osteoporotic patient, remain unpredictable. The osteoprogenitor cells in bone marrow decrease with ageing without losing their osteogeneic potential. Autologous bone marrow cells (BMCs) from iliac crest aspirate can be concentrated in the operating room and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) can be obtained from a peripheral blood as a source of autologous osteoprogenitor cells and growth factors, respectively. We present the case of an 88 year-old multi-diseased osteoporotic patient affected by cervical stenosis and subjected to C3?C7 posterior decompression, instrumentation and posterolateral fusion, using an intraoperative ?tissue-engineered? composite made of corticocancellous bone allograft augmented with autologous BMCs concentrate from iliac crest aspirate enriched with PRF from peripheral blood. Lateral dynamic X-rays and CT scan showed consolidation signs at 3 months follow-up, with solid C3?C7 fusion at 6 months follow-up. This paper describes a simple and effective method for potentially improving the fusion rate in aged osteoporotic patients by using corticocancellous bone allograft augmented with autologous BMCs concentrate from the iliac crest, enriched with PRF from peripheral blood, rapidly obtained before the surgical procedure.

AB  - Abstract Objective ? To review potential platelet storage options, guidelines for administration of platelets, and adverse events associated with platelet transfusions. Data Sources ? Data sources included original research publications and scientific reviews. Human Data Synthesis ? Transfusion of platelet concentrates (PCs) plays a key role in the management of patients with severe thrombocytopenia. Currently PCs are stored at 22°C under continuous gentle agitation for up to 5 days. Chilling of platelets is associated with rapid clearance of transfused platelets, and galactosylation of platelets has proven unsuccessful in prolonging platelet survival. Although approved by the American Association of Blood Banks, cryopreservation of human platelets in 6% DMSO largely remains a research technique. Pre-storage leukoreduction of PCs has reduced but not eliminated acute inflammatory transfusion reactions, with platelet inflammatory mediators contributing to such reactions. Veterinary Data Synthesis ? Canine plateletpheresis allows collection of a concentrate with a high platelet yield, typically 3?4.5 ? 1011 versus <1 ? 1011 for whole blood-derived platelets, improving the ability to provide sufficient platelets to meet the recipient's transfusion needs. Cryopreservation of canine platelets in 6% DMSO offers immediate availability of platelets, with an acceptable posttransfusion in vivo platelet recovery and half-life of 50% and 2 days, respectively. While data on administration of rehydrated lyophilized platelets in bleeding animal models are encouraging, due to a short lifespan (min) posttransfusion, their use will be limited to control of active bleeding, without a sustained increase in platelet count. Conclusions ? Fresh PC remains the product of choice for control of bleeding due to severe thrombocytopenia or thrombopathia. While cryopreservation and lyophilization of canine platelets offer the benefits of immediate availability and long-term storage, the compromise is decreased in vivo recovery and survival of platelets and some degree of impaired function, though such products could still be life saving.

AB  - Purpose? Decision making in the management of combined major skeletal and soft tissue trauma to the lower limb is a complex process made more difficult by the uncertainty surrounding outcomes. The aim of this study is to review and present our experience with flap reconstruction of traumatic lower limb defects, with particular reference to in-hospital complications and outcomes related to timing, choice of flap and pre-existing complications. Methodology? Retrospective review of all lower limb flap reconstructions performed by the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Unit at the Alfred Hospital (largest trauma centre in Australasia) from 1 July 2001 to 20 October 2005 (51 month period). Results? Sixty-four patients had 83 flap reconstructions (35 free, 48 local) of 70 separate lower limb injuries. Twenty-seven flaps (32.5%) developed soft tissue infections and 16 fixation devices (25.8%) were complicated by deep metal infection. There were 6 (12.5%) local flap partial necrosis and 4 (11.4%) free flap failures. Three patients underwent secondary amputation during their initial admission. Thorough wound debridement and internal skeletal fixation were followed by earlier soft tissue coverage and lower deep metal infection rates. Limbs in which flaps were performed after Day 5 were more likely to develop deep metal infection (p?=?0.04) and suffer free flap failure or local flap partial necrosis (p?=?0.02). Conclusion? The current study presented our experience with flap reconstructions of complex lower limb injuries at a major trauma centre. Thorough wound debridement, internal fixation and early soft tissue coverage (within 5 days of injury) is associated with lower infection rates and optimal outcomes.
