AB  - Data on postoperative chylous ascites (CA) after pediatric liver transplantation (LT) are scarce. This retrospective study was conducted to identify the incidence, risk factors, management, and outcomes of postoperative CA in a large single-center pediatric LT cohort (2000-2016). The study cohort comprised 317 LTs (153 living donors and 164 deceased donors) in 310 recipients with a median age of 2.7 years. The incidence of CA was 5.4% (n = 17), diagnosed after a median time of 10 days after LT. Compared with chylomicron detection in peritoneal fluid (the gold standard), a triglyceride cutoff value of 187 mg/dL in peritoneal fluid showed insufficient sensitivity (31%) for CA diagnosis. In univariate logistic regression analyses, ascites before LT, younger age, and lower weight, height, and height-for-age z score at LT were associated with CA. Symptomatic management of CA included peritoneal drain (100%) and diuretics (76%). Therapeutic interventions included very low-fat or medium-chain triglyceride?rich diets (94%) and intravenous octreotide (6%), leading to CA resolution in all patients. CA was associated with prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS; 40 days in the CA group versus 24 days in the non-CA group; P = 0.001) but not with reduced patient or graft survival rates after a median follow-up time of 14 years. In conclusion, CA in the pediatric LT recipient is a relatively uncommon complication associated with increased hospital LOS and morbidity. Measurement of chylomicrons is recommended in patients with ascites that is more severe or persistent than expected. Dietary interventions are effective in most patients.

AB  - Abstract Major haemorrhage is a leading cause of death in critically ill or injured patients requiring medical retrieval and presents significant clinical and logistic challenges irrespective of patient location, primary pathophysiology or mode of transport. It is essential that all care providers involved in the retrieval patient pathway, including referring hospitals, ambulance services, retrieval teams and tertiary receiving centres, adopt a common approach to the management of this complex patient group through the use of retrieval-specific, integrated protocols. These should incorporate the latest clinical evidence base, recognise the differences between primary and inter-facility missions and clearly define the roles and responsibilities of the retrieval clinical coordinator. By unifying the response across services, the aim is to facilitate seamless transition of care with ongoing damage control resuscitation from point of referral, during transfer and on arrival at the receiving centre.

AB  - Summary Cerebrovascular disease is common in older patients, and can present as a simple short-lived transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or a devastating stroke. Other pathologies may mimic stroke or TIA and alternative diagnoses need to be considered. This chapter explains the work-up of TIA and stroke in older patients. Patients may also present to ophthalmology with central retinal artery occlusion or amaurosis fugax and will require the same work-up for cerebrovascular disease. Additional features include: Table reviewing different types of acute stroke typical symptoms and signs on examination Investigation of acute stroke and consideration of rarer causes Thrombolysis and its evidence base in older patients Management of carotid disease Risk: benefit ratio of warfarinisation in frail patients, and review of the novel anticoagulants.

AB  - On behalf of the ?Blood Matters? Planning Group. The Blood Matters Collaborative was structured around a series of specific projects designed to improve distinct aspects of the sequence of care processes that ultimately determine the safety of each and every fresh blood product (red cell, platelet, fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate) transfusion. These commence with the appropriateness of the clinical decision to transfuse blood products, then move to ensure that procedures for patient, sample and blood product identification and blood administration are robust and that any procedural errors and adverse events associated with transfusion are captured, analysed and acted upon. Finally and very importantly the collaborative sought to improve the patient and carers understanding of the risks and benefits of transfusion. It was an ambitious program of work but there seemed little alternative other than addressing all of the interdependent processes that determine the quality and safety of transfusion. All elements in this chain contribute to the actual levels of transfusion safety. With support from the Clinical Innovation Agency and planning group members, local multi-disciplinary hospital teams set out to deliver changes to improve transfusion safety. The collaborative methodology, initially developed by the Institute of Healthcare Improvement in the United States of America, has been adopted and used by a large number of health systems internationally and within Australia. It is based on answering three key questions [Q1. What are we trying to accomplish? Q2. How will we know that a change is an improvement? Q3. What changes can we make that will result in improvement?] and testing ideas through the plan, do, study, act cycles of change. Individual projects monitored progress using ?run charts? to record their measured performance. These indicated progress towards achieving locally set targets and collaborative improvement goals. Our objectives were translated into tangible benefits for patients requiring blood product transfusion. Fundamental to the collaborative approach to improving transfusion practice is the belief that changes can be tested rapidly on a small scale without risk. For example, an idea can quickly be tried with one patient, one clinic or ward, a single consultant or hospital. Only if it proved successful was it suggested for wider adoption as an improvement in care across an entire Health Service or system of care. Our successes reinforced the value of using a systematic method for translating ideas into practice such as that used by the collaborative. The governance structures and teams established during our participation in the collaborative have helped us to identify key local issues and implement strategies to enhance the quality of our transfusion services to our patients. Our aim is to ensure that the continued review and improvement of transfusion practices becomes an integral part of the way that clinical teams and hospital and health system clinical governance structures work. The role of state or national bodies is to support this to happen. We hope to build a series of improvement partnerships that all focus on optimising the quality of transfusion services and the outcomes of patients receiving transfusion during their clinical care.

AB  - Background Anlotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and stem cell factor receptor (c-Kit). In the phase III ALTER-0303 trial (Clinical Trial Registry ID: NCT 02388919), anlotinib significantly improved overall survival versus placebo in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients who had received at least two previous chemotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor/anaplastic lymphoma kinase targeted therapy regimens. This study summarized adverse event management in this trial. Methods Patients were randomized (2:1) to anlotinib or placebo up to progression or intolerable toxicity. Adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 and managed by investigators. Key strategies for preventing and managing the most common adverse events included patient education, supportive care, and dose modification. Results Between February 2015 and August 2016, 294 patients received anlotinib. A total of 170 (57.8%) patients received antihypertensive medications for hypertension, 53 (18.0%) patients received levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, 24 (8.2%) patients received fibrates for hypertriglyceridemia, 11 (3.7%) patients took cortisone cream for hand-foot syndrome, and 38 (12.9%) patients received anti-diarrheal medications for diarrhea. Dose reduction and drug discontinuation were required in 24 (8.16%) and 31 (10.54%) patients in the anlotinib group, respectively. Conclusion Anlotinb-related adverse events could be controlled by patient education, prophylactic measures, early and active intervention, and dose modification.

AB  - Objectives To determine whether dogs with surgically excised mast cell tumours receiving a vinblastine/prednisolone chemotherapy protocol in combination with radiation therapy are at greater risk of myelosuppression than patients receiving the chemotherapy protocol alone. Materials and Methods Retrospective study of clinical records of dogs with mast cell tumours that, subsequent to surgical excision, had received combination vinblasine/prednisolone chemotherapy. Dogs were assigned to two groups: those treated with adjunctive radiotherapy and vinblastine/prednisolone (RT group) and those treated with surgery followed by vinblastine/prednisolone alone (control group). Haematology results were compared between groups. Results Forty-three cases and 43 controls of similar breed, age and bodyweight were included. Concurrent radiation and vinblastine chemotherapy did not appear to increase the risk of neutropenia, which was observed in 18.6 and 23.2% of cases in the RT and control groups, respectively. Clinical Significance Radiation and vinblastine chemotherapy can be safely combined in dogs with mast cell tumours without increasing the risk of clinically important myelosuppression.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare outcomes and identify prognostic factors in dogs with single congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt (CEHPSS) gradually attenuated with an ameroid ring constrictor (ARC) or cellophane banding (CB). Study Design Retrospective, multi-institutional study. Animals Forty-nine dogs with CEHPSS (n?=?23 for ARC; n?=?26 for CB). Methods Medical records of dogs with CEHPSS treated by ARC or CB were reviewed for postoperative (<1 month), midterm (1-6 months), and long-term (> 6 months) outcomes. Data were evaluated to detect factors associated with postoperative complications, residual shunting, and long-term outcome. Results Postoperative complication rates did not differ between ARC (26.1%) and CB (23.1%, P?=?.89) and were negatively associated with body weight (P?=?.03). Overall, postoperative mortality was low (2.0%). Clinical long-term outcome was excellent in 45.0% and 39.1% and good in 55.0% and 60.9% of dogs after ARC and CB, respectively. Suspected residual shunting rate upon abdominal ultrasonography was greater after CB (31.6%) than after ARC (0%). Conclusion ARC and CB were both effective for attenuation of CEHPSS, resulting in good to excellent outcomes with low morbidity and mortality. Residual shunting was suspected in a higher proportion of dogs treated with CB on the basis of abdominal ultrasonography results. However, further prospective randomized studies must be conducted with validated evaluation methods to verify this assumption.

AB  - SUMMARY Despite advances in surgical tools and techniques and the development of rapid transport systems to highly specialized medical centers, mortality rates from exsanguination due to injuries sustained in military and civilian trauma have not improved appreciably in the last 150 years. Scientists and clinicians, motivated by the promise of new hemorrhage control adjuncts, have recently increased research and development in an effort to combat this problem. This review describes the epidemiology of hemorrhagic death in both the military and civilian populations, the research implications of these injury patterns, and some of the most promising products ? whether already in use or under evaluation ? for the control of bleeding. A survey of fibrinogen-based products, recombinant factor VIIa, antifibrinolytic agents, products containing poly-N-acetyl glucosamine and other novel agents are presented. Preclinical and clinical data of products are outlined and the physical properties, mechanisms of action, and safety issues for each hemorrhage-control agent are discussed.

AB  - Background & Objectives Serologic testing after transfusion reactions (TRs) aims to find accountable immune haemolytic incompatibility. Our hospital policies recommend serologic testing in all TR, except for low-risk fevers (subclinical temperature <39°C) or uncomplicated allergic reactions. Assessing compliance with these guidelines and serologic testing yields may provide insights on quality of practice and value. Materials & Methods Interrogation of two haemovigilance databases identified all possible-to-definite TR over a 4-year period (2013?2016) at four academic hospitals. We reviewed the performance and outcome of serologic testing by site, year, reaction type, implicated product and service. Results Serologic testing occurred in 769 (55%) of 1408 referrals, with 1153 (82%) compliant with guidelines. Similar proportions deviated to overtesting (85/550 [15%]) and undertesting (174/858 [20%]), with undertesting seen most often in atypical TR. Overall, 30 (4.4%) of 769 cases had a new finding, but only 2 (0.3%) reflected host-derived antibodies. Overall, the number needed to test to discover an unexpected allospecificity was 385, or 253 if limited to high-risk fevers. Reaction- and product-specific yields ranged from 0% to 48%. The yield in complicated allergic reactions was low at 2%, constituting only predictable passive isohaemagglutinin(s) in retrospect. Investigated IVIG TR accounted for most of this cohort?s signal by passive isohaemagglutinins in 48%. Conclusion The performance of post-TR serologic testing revealed practice gaps and expected context-specific yields. Tailored serologic testing (i.e. indirect antiglobulin tests for alloantibodies in post-RBC/high-risk febrile reactions, ± isoagglutinin-focused tests after IVIG or ABO-minor-mismatched platelets) may improve value and liberate resources for other unmet needs in TR investigation.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the injuries of liver and spleen. In a nonoperative patient, angiographic embolization (AE) can be an adjunct in liver injuries that contains an arterio-venous fistula or have ongoing bleeding. Nonoperative management of blunt liver injuries in patients with normal hemodynamics is recommended with greater than 90% success. Hydatid disease of the liver is uncommon. It is caused by parasitic Echinococcus, which has dogs as its definitive hosts. Patients with high-grade liver injuries have an increased risk of developing post-injury biloma as a complication. The accessory spleen is a common anomaly, occurring in up to 20% of the population. However, it can occur in up to 30% of patients with a hematologic disorder. Splenic artery aneurysm is very uncommon, but it is the third most frequent abdominal artery to undergo aneurismal changes.

AB  - ABSTRACT Segmental bone loss remains a challenging clinical problem for orthopaedic trauma surgeons. In addition to the missing bone itself, the local tissues (soft tissue, vascular) are often highly traumatized as well, resulting in a less than ideal environment for bone regeneration. As a result, attempts at limb salvage become a highly expensive endeavor, often requiring multiple operations and necessitating the use of every available strategy (autograft, allograft, bone graft substitution, Masquelet, bone transport, etc.) to achieve bony union. A cost-sensitive, functionally appropriate, and volumetrically adequate engineered substitute would be practice-changing for orthopaedic trauma surgeons and these patients with difficult clinical problems. In tissue engineering and bone regeneration fields, numerous research efforts continue to make progress toward new therapeutic interventions for segmental bone loss, including novel biomaterial development as well as cell-based strategies. Despite an ever-evolving literature base of these new therapeutic and engineered options, there remains a disconnect with the clinical practice, with very few translating into clinical use. A symposium entitled ?Building better bone: The weaving of biologic and engineering strategies for managing bone loss,? was presented at the 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society Conference to further explore this engineering-clinical disconnect, by surveying basic, translational, and clinical researchers along with orthopaedic surgeons and proposing ideas for pushing the bar forward in the field of segmental bone loss. ? 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

There are rare literatures that address the outcome in these patients. Therefore, we collected our database, analyzed the outcome, reliability, and related-management of microsurgical technique in the patients with hematological diseases. Methods A retrospective chart review of 20 patients with hematological disorders who received free tissue transfers during 20-years period in a single microsurgical center was done. Eleven patients who received head and neck reconstruction were found to have hyperfibrinogenemia. Seven patients with reactive thrombocytosis after trauma, and two patients with leukemia had soft tissue defects in the upper and lower extremities. Twenty-six flaps were used for free tissue transfers. Intra-operatively all patients received intravenous 5,000 Ud of heparin post immediate reperfusion. Anti-coagulant medication such as Dextran-40 or prostaglandin-E1 (PGE1) was given postoperatively. Results Twenty-three of the 26 free flaps survived without vascular compromise. Intra-operatively all patients received intravenous 5,000 Ud of heparin post immediate reperfusion, and anti-coagulant medication such as Dextran-40 or prostaglandin-E1 was given to the patients postoperatively. The three failed cases were found in patients with hyperfibrinogenemia and needed further reconstruction with another flap. The overall success rate was 88.5% (23/26). Conclusions Hematologic disorder is not a predicted factor of free flap failure. The key factors for success flap survival in patients with hematologic disorders include preoperative knowledge of the medical condition and monitoring potential post-operative complications, aggressive hematologist consultations, and meticulous non-traumatic surgical anastomosis. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT A method, based on well-established trauma principles, is described for surgical management of serious intrathoracic bleeding complications that can occur during the extraction of pacemaker or defibrillator leads. Using this method, four patients who experienced rapid hemodynamic deterioration due to traumatic injury of the superior vena cava and its tributaries during defibrillator lead extraction underwent successful surgical repair. Perioperative preparation for high-risk lead extractions, management of major bleeding complications, and surgical repair techniques are discussed. Major bleeding complications can be managed effectively with this strategy leading to excellent overall success rates for extractions without mortality. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12500 (J Card Surg 2015;30:149?153)

AB  - Summary There are several physiological adaptations to pregnancy that facilitate the maternal response to hemorrhage and coagulation. Defects in either of these mechanisms along with genital tract lacerations lead to postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Massive transfusion protocols (MTPs) transfuse preemptively with blood products using a balanced ratio of plasma and platelets to red blood cells. These protocols effectively replace the traditional approach of delaying replacement of plasma and platelets until deficiencies were demonstrated by laboratory analysis. Infants born to women with PPH, particularly those secondary to abnormal placentation are delivered early and are at risk for complications from prematurity. In developed nations, an uterotonic medication is given after delivery of the newborn or placenta to prevent PPH. PPH is best managed by a multidisciplinary team approach incorporating protocols for the evaluation and management of bleeding, and volume resuscitation and blood product replacement.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the influence of administering allogeneic blood products (ABP) on the progression of hemangiosarcoma in dogs. Study design Multi-institutional, retrospective study. Sample population One hundred four dogs with hemangiosarcoma that survived until postoperative discharge from the hospital. Methods Medical records of dogs that had been operated on for hemoangiosarcoma were reviewed for signalment, presence of a hemoabdomen, presence of metastatic disease, and whether the dog had received chemotherapy or Yunnan Baiyao. Data that were collected were compared between dogs that received perioperative ABP and those that did not. Disease-free interval was compared between groups. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to obtain univariate descriptive statistics for time to clinical decline. A multivariable Cox regression model was used to analyze association or effect of potential predictor variables. Results The median disease-free interval (DFI) was shorter in the 67 dogs that received a blood transfusion (76 days; range, 1-836) than in the 37 dogs that did not receive a blood transfusion (120 days; range, 38-916). According to the multivariable Cox regression model, administration of blood products (P?=?.04) and the presence of gross metastatic disease at the time of surgery (P?<?.01) shortened the DFI, whereas administration of Yunnan Baiyao (P?=?.01) prolonged the DFI. Conclusion Allogeneic blood product administration was associated with a shorter disease-free interval in this population. However, we could not demonstrate the association between blood products and shorter DFI because of confounding factors. Clinical significance Dogs that receive ABP at the time of surgical therapy for hemangiosarcoma may have accelerated disease progression compared with dogs that do not receive ABP.

AB  - Abstract Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a severe adverse drug effect consisting of bone destruction of the maxilla and/or mandible. The most common precipitating event described in the literature is the extraction of a tooth followed by ?spontaneous? occurrence with no clear predisposing event. Current studies are investigating methods of managing dental extractions in patients at risk of MRONJ; however, no studies to date examine the aetiology and management of ?spontaneous? MRONJ. This paper describes two cases of ?spontaneous? MRONJ seen at the Dental Unit in the Alfred Hospital and systematically reviews the current literature. No significant interactions (P > 0.05) were detected between variables: age, sex, bone disease, antiresorptive, antiresorptive duration, jaw, location and stage. ?Spontaneous? cases were commonly associated with the mylohyoid ridge, palatal tori and other anatomical sites, and tended to occur in those generally considered at low risk of developing MRONJ. The review suggests that perhaps the term ?spontaneous? is a misnomer and thorough history taking is critical in establishing a precipitating event.
