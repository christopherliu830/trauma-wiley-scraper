AB  - Purpose? This study aimed to evaluate the pattern of solid intra-abdominal organ injuries in Central Australia, with focus on the mechanism of injury, Injury Severity Score (ISS), distribution of injury, role of surgical intervention and their outcome. It aimed to assess if difference exists in the above perimeters between the indigenous and non-indigenous population. Methodology? This is a retrospective analysis of a selected group of patients as identified by ICD Codes. Database has been created for patients admitted with renal, pancreatic, hepatic and splenic trauma over a five-year period (2001?2005). Data on demographics, mechanism of injury, distribution of injury, length of stay and ISS has been collected. Results? Seventy-one patients has been identified, with 51 (72%) indigenous and 20 (28%) non-indigenous. 29 patients (41%) were involved in a Motor Vehicle Accident and 33 (46%) were assaulted. There is no statistical difference with the distribution of injury and ISS amongst indigenous and non-indigenous populations. However there appears to have a higher incidence of surgical intervention associated with the indigenous group (28.8% versus 12.5%). This may be explained by the compliance rate as 29.4% of indigenous patients left against medical advice as compared with 0% with the non-indigenous group. Conclusion? The mechanism, pattern and severity of injury appear to be comparable amongst the indigenous and non-indigenous population in Central Australia. However there is a difference in their incidence of surgical intervention. ISS may not be as useful in prediction for need for intervention in this group and a different approach to trauma management may need to be tailored to this population.

AB  - Summary One of the most common events in equine practice is the presentation of a trauma resulting in skin and soft-tissue wounds. The physiological benefits of utilizing photobiomodulation therapy as part of the treatment plan in the management of these lesions are a relief of pain, a modulation of the inflammatory response, an increase in circulation, and a subsequent acceleration of the healing process. This chapter provides an overview of the physiological and cellular mechanisms involved, the optimum application techniques, dosages, the frequency of treatment, and the integral role of photobiomodulation therapy in the care of these patients.

AB  - Summary Abdominal emergencies in the older patient frequently present atypically, and there is a high rate of misdiagnosis. Abdominal pain may be absent or minimal despite the present of serious intra-abdominal pathology. Abdominal pain may also be the presenting complaint in pulmonary or cardiac conditions. The commonest causes of abdominal symptoms in the older patient include biliary disease, bowel obstruction, diverticulitis, appendicitis, and peptic ulcer disease. Caution should be taken attributing abdominal pain to more benign conditions such as urinary tract infection or constipation, for fear of missing more serious pathology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Various bioactive substances are released from white cell (WBC) granules into red cell (RBC) components in a time-dependent manner during blood storage. Some of these substances may have immunosuppressive effects and may contribute to transfusion-induced immunomodulation. RBCs transfused after prolonged storage may be associated with a higher incidence of postoperative infections than fresh RBCs. This hypothesis does not seem to have been investigated in a clinical study. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The records of 416 consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft operations at the Massachusetts General Hospital were reviewed. The association between the length of storage of the transfused RBCs, as well as the number of units of non-WBC-reduced allogeneic RBCs and/or platelets transfused, and the occurrence of postoperative pneumonia was calculated by logistic regression analyses adjusting for the effects of confounding factors. Among these were the numbers of days of intubation, days of impaired consciousness, and units of RBCs transfused. RESULTS: By Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria, pneumonia developed in 54 patients (13.0%). Among 269 patients given RBCs, the risk of pneumonia increased by 1 percent per day of increase in the mean storage time of the transfused RBCs (p<0.005). In an analysis of all patients, the risk of pneumonia increased by 5 percent per unit of non-WBC-reduced allogeneic RBCs and/or platelets received (p = 0.0584). CONCLUSION: After adjustment for the effects of the risk factors for pneumonia and the number of transfused RBCs, an association was observed between the length of storage of transfused RBCs and the development of postoperative pneumonia. This association should be investigated further in future studies of the outcomes of blood transfusion.

AB  - Abstract Compared to the other classes of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), that is, chondroitin/dermatan sulfate, heparin/heparan sulfate and hyaluronan, keratan sulfate (KS), have the least known of its interactive properties. In the human body, the cornea and the brain are the two most abundant tissue sources of KS. Embryonic KS is synthesized as a linear poly-N-acetyllactosamine chain of d-galactose-GlcNAc repeat disaccharides which become progressively sulfated with development, sulfation of GlcNAc is more predominant than galactose. KS contains multi-sulfated high-charge density, monosulfated and non-sulfated poly-N-acetyllactosamine regions and thus is a heterogeneous molecule in terms of chain length and charge distribution. A recent proteomics study on corneal KS demonstrated its interactivity with members of the Slit-Robbo and Ephrin-Ephrin receptor families and proteins which regulate Rho GTPase signaling and actin polymerization/depolymerization in neural development and differentiation. KS decorates a number of peripheral nervous system/CNS proteoglycan (PG) core proteins. The astrocyte KS-PG abakan defines functional margins of the brain and is up-regulated following trauma. The chondroitin sulfate/KS PG aggrecan forms perineuronal nets which are dynamic neuroprotective structures with anti-oxidant properties and roles in neural differentiation, development and synaptic plasticity. Brain phosphacan a chondroitin sulfate, KS, HNK-1 PG have roles in neural development and repair. The intracellular microtubule and synaptic vesicle KS-PGs MAP1B and SV2 have roles in metabolite transport, storage, and export of neurotransmitters and cytoskeletal assembly. MAP1B has binding sites for tubulin and actin through which it promotes cytoskeletal development in growth cones and is highly expressed during neurite extension. The interactive capability of KS with neuroregulatory ligands indicate varied roles for KS-PGs in development and regenerative neural processes.

AB  - Introduction: Quantitative measures derived from the electroencephalogram (qEEG) have been used extensively in human medicine to assess the function of the brain under clinical manipulation (such as anesthesia and sedation), as well as in disease states (such as head trauma, coma and stroke). The goal of this study was to determine if qEEG measures could be used to predict the response of cats under isoflurane concentration to noxious stimuli. Methods: Twelve cats aged 1?2 years were included. Neurological and physical examination, blood chemistries and CBCs were normal in all cats. Anesthesia was induced with isoflurane (ISO) in O2, the cat was intubated and the femoral artery catheterized. The following physiologic data were collected continuously throughout the course of the experiment: temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, and end-tidal CO2 and ISO concentrations. An Aspect Medical Systems A-1050 monitor was used to continuously record the raw electroencephalogram (EEG) and several qEEG measures including bispectral index (BIS), spectral edge frequency (SEF), burst suppression ratio (BSR), and total EEG power (POW). ISO concentration was maintained constant for 15?minutes, after which a tail clamp was applied for 1?minute. If the cat responded, the concentration was increased 10% and the procedure repeated. If the cat did not respond, the ISO concentration was decreased 10% and the procedure repeated. The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) was the midpoint between a positive and negative response and, for each cat, this was determined three times. Results: BIS was significantly lower in cats at the lowest concentration at which there was no response (MAC?, 21.3±28.3) than at the highest concentration at which there was a response (MAC+, 63.4±22.1; p<.01, Wilcoxon signed rank). However, in 3/12 cats (25%), BIS was higher at MAC? than at MAC+. Of the other qEEG measures, only BSR was significantly different between MAC? and MAC+ (50.4±34.4 vs. 6.1±19.4, p<.01). Of the physiologic data collected, only respiratory rate was different between MAC? and MAC+ (29.4±10.0 vs. 45.3±17.9, p<.05). Conclusions: These results suggest that qEEG measures may be useful for anesthesia monitoring in cats, but measures that are less species-specific than the BIS may hold more promise. In addition, this work suggests that further studies utilizing qEEG measures for evaluation of sedation during ventilation as well as outcome prediction in animals with head trauma and critical illnesses with CNS complications are indicated.

AB  - Purpose? Prospective validation of recently established independent predictors for postinjury abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) was performed. Methodology? All trauma patients who met inclusion criteria (ICU admission, ISS?>?15, Base Deficit (BD)?>?5, or resuscitation with >5?L crystalloids) were prospectively monitored. Patients with isolated head injuries were excluded. Demographics, ISS, resuscitation fluids, physiological parameters, intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and the independent predictors in two time windows ?ED discharge?[SBP, crystalloids, Time-to OR, transfusions] and ?ICU admission?[crystalloids, urine output (UO), Hb, Temperature, BD] were collected. Data are presented as mean ?±? SEM, p?<?0.05 considered significant. Results? Twenty-two blunt trauma patients were monitored (Age 39?±?5 years, 77% males, ISS 32?±?2, SBP 107?±?5 mmHg, BD 7?±?1). No patients developed ACS. Seven patients developed IAH (IAP?>?20?mmHg). IAH and non-IAH patients had the same age (41?±?7 vs 37?±?5?yrs) and admission BD (7.5?±?1.3 vs 6.3?±?1.2). IAH patients had higher ISS than non-IAH patients (39?±?3 vs 30?±?2). Outcomes (IAH vs non-IAH): ICU LOS (39?±?3 vs 30?±?2), Mortality (0% vs 7%), MOF (29% vs 0%). ?ED-discharge predictors?: The IAH and non-IAH patients had similar admission SBP, ED crystalloid volume, transfusions and ED time. ?ICU-admission predictors?: IAH and non-IAH patients had similar UO, crystalloid infusions, BD, temperature but the IAH group had lower Hb (99?±?5 vs 111?±?3?g/dl) than the non-IAH patients. Conclusions? The incidence of ACS decreased from 14% to 0% in a comparable population. The predictors for ACS did not predict IAH. After the elimination of the lethal ACS, the clinical importance of postinjury IAH has to be defined.

AB  - Summary.? Infection frequently elicits a coagulation response. Endotoxin triggers the formation of tissue factor initiating coagulation, down regulates anticoagulant mechanisms including the protein C pathway and heparin-like proteoglycans and up regulates plasminogen activator inhibitor. The overall physiological result of this is to promote coagulation through enhancing initiation, suppressing negative regulation and impairing fibrin removal. The response to infection also leads to tissue destruction. Nucleosomes and histones released from the injured cells trigger further inflammation, protection from the pathogen but further tissue injury leading to multi-organ failure. Such a complex response to infection presumably arises due to the role of coagulation in the control and clearance of the infectious agent.

AB  - A simple and rapid technique for the emergency removal of lung lobes was developed. It has been used successfully in 2 cats and 10 dogs without complications being recognized in any, with a minimum follow-up of four months. The purpose of this abstract is three-fold: 1) To briefly describe how the technique was done; 2) To describe the results of the use of the technique in these 14 emergency cases; and 3) Provide recommendations for the continued use of the technique in emergency cases. Method: The lung lobe requiring removal was selected and elevated; soft connective tissues around the lung lobe base were separated from the main pedicle using a fine curved scissors. With mild traction applied, 3 curved Halstead or Kelly hemostatic forceps were applied across the entire pedicle, one right after the other except for a break between the last 2 distal clamps. The lung lobe was removed by cutting the entire pedicle with a Metzenbaum scissors between the distal most clamps. The tips of the scissors were tilted slightly to produce a ?tissue bumper? of 1?3?mm above the distal most hemostatic forceps left. A Miller's knot of 3?0 to 2?0 polypropylene (cats and very small dogs) and 0 to 1 polypropylene (medium to large dogs) was applied around the entire pedicle under the clamps and tightened as the proximal most clamp was loosened briefly (flashed). The ends of the suture were continued to be carried around the pedicle in the direction they were coursing and then tied. A third ligation of the polypropylene was completed in large pedicles or where added security was deemed necessary such as in cases with a torn lung lobe due to trauma. Results: The procedure was used in emergency lung lobectomy in 2 cats involving 3 lobes and in 10 dogs. The reasons for emergency lobectomy were lung consolidation in 4 dogs (involving 6 lobes), trauma with severe tears or openings in 4 dogs (involving 6 lobes), a leaking congenital bulla in 1 dog, and 1 abscess/foreign body (wooden stick). Time taken to perform a lobectomy with this technique ranged from 3?7?minutes. No leaks or complications with the pedicle have been observed in any of the cases. Because only limited dissection is needed to perform the lobectomy, the author recommends this method over conventional lobectomy where artery, bronchus and vein are all managed individually.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Adverse effects on renal health and haemostasis have been documented in human patients administered hydroxyethyl starches (HES). Gelatins could provide useful substitutes for HES should similar adverse effects be identified in horses. Objectives To compare the effects of a 4% modified fluid gelatin (MFG) with a 130/0.4 6% tetrastarch (TES) on haemodilution, colloid osmotic pressure (COP), haemostasis and renal parameters in healthy ponies. Study design Randomised crossover. Methods Three treatments (A?=?10?ml/kg bwt TES, B?=?10?ml/kg bwt MFG and C?=?20?ml/kg bwt MFG) were administered to 6 healthy ponies with a one-week washout period. Packed cell volume (PCV), total serum protein (TSP), COP, platelet count, fibrinogen, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and thromboelastography (TEG) were measured at baseline and at multiple time points up to 24?h post infusion. Serum creatinine, urine specific gravity (USG), urine protein:creatinine (UPC), urine GGT:creatinine (UGC) and urine sediment examination (USE) were performed before and 24?h after each treatment, and one week after the final treatment. Results All treatments caused significant haemodilution and increases in COP with treatment C having a significantly greater effect on PCV than other treatments. The platelet count decreased with all treatments and was significantly lower for treatment C compared with treatment B. No significant differences were observed in any TEG parameter within or between treatments. No significant differences in PT, aPTT or fibrinogen were observed between treatments. Serum creatinine, UGC and UPC did not change significantly pre- and post study. USG and USE remained within normal limits. Conclusions 4% MFG could be considered as an alternative to 130/0.4 6% TES for volume expansion and oncotic support. Neither MFG nor TES were associated with clinically significant adverse effects on haemostasis or renal parameters.

AB  - 1 Tallie Z. Baram, 1 Kristen L. Brunson, 1 Celine Dube, 1 Sarit Avishai-Eliner, and 1 Kristina A. Fenoglio ( 1 Pediatrics, Anatomy/ Neurobiology, UCI, Irvine, CA ) Seizures often arise in the setting of an acute injury or insult. In addition, many of the epilepsies are ?symptomatic?, i.e., they occur in individuals who had sustained injury or insult such as infection, trauma, or stroke. The mechanisms by which diverse factors such as infection or trauma provoke both acute seizures and recurrent, chronic seizures (epilepsy) are not fully understood. To some extent, each of these insults may initiate a unique chain of events that promotes epilepsy. However, these insults also share commonalities that set in motion cellular and molecular changes that promote neuronal hyperexcitability: All these epilepsy- provoking insults are stressful, in that they trigger the release and actions of ?stress-mediating molecules?, including glucocorticoids and the intrinsic central nervous system (CNS) stress-activated neuro-peptide, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). Stress induces release of CRH from hippocampal interneurons, and CRH acts on selective receptors (CRF-R1) to enhance glutamate-mediated neurotransmission. In immature hippocampus, CRH and the CRH receptors are particularly abundant, so that the peptide may excite neurons sufficiently to evoke seizures, followed by dendritic atrophy or death of vulnerable neurons. In animal models, chronic enhancement of CRH levels within the developing hippocampus, may result in enduring reduction of hippocampus- governed learning and memory function. Such levels might be found in infants with chronic CNS stressors including congenital infection, dysplasia, trauma or recurrent seizures. Indeed, drugs that downregulate CRH levels in limbic structures (e.g., ACTH) are potent antiepileptics in the developing CNS. In summary, acute and chronic stress elicits the release of pro-excitatory molecules (CRH), promoting seizures. These further activate the ?stress response?, leading to a vicious cycle culminating in loss of neuronal function and integrity.

AB  - Summary Snake venoms are mixtures of numerous proteinacious components that exert diverse functional activities on a variety of physiological targets. Because the toxic constituents found in venom vary from species to species, snakebite victims can present with a variety of life-threatening pathologies related to the neurotoxic, cytotoxic and haemotoxic effects of venom. Of the 1·8 million people envenomed by snakes every year, up to 125 000 die, while hundreds of thousands survive only to suffer with life-changing long-term morbidity. Consequently, snakebite is one of the world's most severe neglected tropical diseases. Many snake venoms exhibit strong haemotoxic properties by interfering with blood pressure, clotting factors and platelets, and by directly causing haemorrhage. In this review we provide an overview of the functional activities of haemotoxic venom proteins, the pathologies they cause in snakebite victims and how their exquisite selectivity and potency make them amenable for use as therapeutic and diagnostic tools relevant for human medicine.

To our knowledge, no comprehensive evaluation of the causes or clinical indications of effusion (RPE) in the retroperitoneal space exists. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the causes, presenting signs, clinical findings and outcomes associated with RPE. The records of 23 cats and 44 dogs presenting to the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine between 1996 and 2003 and having been identified with RPE were reviewed. The presence of RPE was identified using abdominal ultrasonography. All of the cats and 84% (n=38) of dogs in this study presented through the Emergency Service. Diagnoses for RPE were categorized as follows: (Group 1) 14 dogs and 3 cats with acute renal failure associated with infection; (Group 2) 5 dogs and 6 cats with acute renal failure of unknown etiology; (Group 3) 3 cats with acute renal failure due to urinary tract obstruction; (Group 4) 8 dogs with adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 5) 7 dogs and 1 cat with non-adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 6) 5 dogs and 4 cats with other renal disease, and (Group 7) 5 dogs and 6 cats with RPF due to other causes. The most frequent presenting complaints in all categories except for those in Group 4 included anorexia, lethargy and vomiting. Physical examination findings were very similar for all categories except for those in Group 4 and included abdominal pain, dehydration, mental depression, lethargy and weakness. For those in Group 4, the most common complaints were collapse or marked weakness, anorexia, lethargy, and discomfort. The physical examination findings for dogs in Group 4 also included collapse or marked weakness, and abdominal distension. Percent mortality for dogs was 39% and, for cats, 43%. In each category, the percent mortalities are as follows (euthanized=e, died=d): Group 1: dogs: 14% (e n=1, d n=1), and cats: 33% (e n=1); Group 2: dogs: 100% (e n=4, d n=1) and cats 67% (e n=4).; Group 3: cats: 100% (e n=2, d n=1); Group 4: dogs: 32% (e n=3); Group 5: dogs: 71% (e n=5) and cats: 0%;. Group 6: dogs: 0% and cats: 25% (e n=1), and Group 7: dogs: 40% (e n=2) and cats: 17% (e n=1). Retroperitoneal effusion, regardless of cause, is associated with significant disease. In people, another category of disease associated with RPE is trauma. Although this category is not included in this study, abdominal ultrasonography of trauma victims may identify a veterinary population with RPE.

AB  - Abstract Besides the use of autologous bone grafting several osteoconductive and osteoinductive methods have been reported to improve bone healing. However, persistent non-union occurs in a considerable number of cases and compromised angiogenesis is suspected to impede bone regeneration. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) improves angiogenesis. This study evaluates the effects of HBO on bone defects treated with autologous bone grafting in a bone defect model in rabbits. Twenty-four New-Zealand White Rabbits were subjected to a unilateral critical sized diaphyseal radius bone defect and treated with autologous cancellous bone transplantation. The study groups were exposed to an additional HBO treatment regimen. Bone regeneration was evaluated radiologically and histologically at 3 and 6 weeks, angiogenesis was assessed by immunohistochemistry at three and six weeks. The additional administration of HBO resulted in a significantly increased new bone formation and angiogenesis compared to the sole treatment with autologous bone grafting. These results were apparent after three and six weeks of treatment. The addition of HBO therapy to autologous bone grafts leads to significantly improved bone regeneration. The increase in angiogenesis observed could play a crucial role for the results observed. ? 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Orthop Res 33:513?520, 2015.

AB  - SUMMARY Objectives The objectives of this study were to determine: (i) the incidence of massive transfusion (MT) (defined as transfusion of ≥5 red-blood-cell (RBC) units within 4?h, and/or ≥10 RBC units within 24?h of bleeding) over a 3-year period; (ii) the cause, and mortality rate of patients who received MT (from any cause); and (iii) the risk factors for death. Background MT can occur in different clinical settings, yet little is known about its epidemiology/clinical outcomes. Methods Data was extracted using transfusion laboratory information management system (LIMS) and patients' electronic databases. Results We identified 701 episodes (incidence 1.7 per 1000 admissions [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6?1.9], belonging to 678 patients (225 females and 453 males, median age 61). Main causes of MT were cardiac surgery (35%), trauma (28%), medical (10%) and vascular surgery (9%). The overall mortality was 32%, and the median number of days spent in hospital was 14 and 2 for those who survived and those who died, respectively. Multivariable analysis showed that cardiac surgery was associated with 56% (95% CI: 9?78%) lower odds of death compared to other surgery, and transfusion of 10?14 RBC and >15 RBC units (compared with 5?9 RBC units) were associated with 2.1 (95% CI: 1.4?3.3) and 9.9 (95% CI: 4.6?21.1) times higher odds of dying, respectively. Conclusion In-hospital morbidity and mortality of MT is high. Future research should focus on unifying the definition of MT, and early identification of the MT markers in order to improve outcomes.

AB  - Summary Antibodies can cause hyperacute, acute, or chronic rejection of allografts. These different types of rejection involve additional humoral mediators, including complement, coagulation factors, and cytokines, which engage cells of the innate immune system, notably platelets, granulocytes, and monocyte/macrophages. In this chapter we discuss the functional properties of antibodies that influence which humoral and cellular mediators are activated. Then the effects of complement activation and regulation are considered. The mechanisms by which antibodies and complement modulate interactions between innate immune cells and the vascular endothelium are summarized as a basis for understanding the pathogenesis of different types of graft destruction.
