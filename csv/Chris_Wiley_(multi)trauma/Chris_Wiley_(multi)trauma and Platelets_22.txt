AB  - ABSTRACT Heterotopic ossification (HO) is the de novo formation of bone that occurs in soft tissue, through recruitment, expansion, and differentiation of multiple cells types including transient brown adipocytes, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, mast cells, and platelets to name a few. Much evidence is accumulating that suggests changes in metabolism may be required to accomplish this bone formation. Recent work using a mouse model of heterotopic bone formation reliant on delivery of adenovirus-transduced cells expressing low levels of BMP2 showed the immediate expansion of a unique brown adipocyte-like cell. These cells are undergoing robust uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation to a level such that oxygen in the microenvironment is dramatically lowered creating areas of hypoxia. It is unclear how these oxygen changes ultimately affect metabolism and bone formation. To identify the processes and changes occurring over the course of bone formation, HO was established in the mice, and tissues isolated at early and late times were subjected to a global metabolomic screen. Results show that there are significant changes in both glucose levels, as well as TCA cycle intermediates. Additionally, metabolites necessary for oxidation of stored lipids were also found to be significantly elevated. The complete results of this screen are presented here, and provide a unique picture of the metabolic changes occurring during heterotopic bone formation. J. Cell.

AB  - Abstract Most childhood immune thrombocytopenic purpure is benign, self-limiting and requires no therapy. However, questions remain: (i) to treat or not; (ii) bone marrow examination or not; and (iii) admit to hospital or not. These questions have dominated the literature and we still need a prospective large multi-centre study of these issues to determine a useful bleeding score, quality of life measure and a measure of parental anxiety.

AB  - Summary.? Experience of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa, NovoSeven?; Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) to control haemorrhage in non-haemophilic children is limited. The object of this study was to examine the applicability and safety of rFVIIa amongst a group of non-haemophilic paediatric subjects. Details of all non-haemophilic children ≤16?years receiving rFVIIa whose data were recorded in the investigational, internet-based registry, haemostasis.com were analysed. A total of 265 children (mean age 7.7?years) were treated with rFVIIa; the median dose administered was 78.4??g?kg?1 body weight (range 9.0?393.4) and the median total dose received 100.0??g?kg?1 body weight (range 10.9?1341.2). Therapeutic areas included surgery (34.5%), coagulopathy (including thrombocytopenia; 29.0%), spontaneous bleeding (17.2%), trauma (8.4%) and intracranial haemorrhage (4.5%). Two patients experienced thromboembolic events following administration of rFVIIa. Thirty-nine patients died on account of haemorrhage or complications relating to their underlying condition; neither the thromboembolic events nor the deaths were related to rFVIIa administration. Bleeding stopped in 118/237 (49.8%), markedly decreased in 54/237 (22.8%), decreased in 51/237 (21.5%), remained unchanged in 13/237 (5.5%) and increased in 1/237 (0.4%) patients. These results suggest that rFVIIa is safe and widely applicable in children to control non-haemophilic haemorrhage.

AB  - Abstract Oligodendroglial reactions to compression injury of spinal cord include apoptosis, secondary demyelination, and remyelination failure. Within hours after contusion, the membrane lipid peroxidation (MLP) byproduct, 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), increases rapidly in gray matter and thereafter in white matter tracts beyond the initial lesion level. Considering that HNE is a mediator and marker of neuronal MLP toxicity in various neurodegenerative conditions, the present study examined its effect on the regeneration potential of oligodendrocyte progenitors, as defined by their capacity to survive, proliferate and migrate in primary culture. Treatment of oligodendroblasts with HNE evoked a time- and dose-dependent cytotoxicity resembling apoptosis at aldehyde concentrations known to be produced by neurons and achieved in tissue undergoing peroxidative injury. In addition, sublethal concentrations of HNE inhibited the mitogenic and chemotactic responses of more immature progenitors to platelet-derived growth factor. These effects appear to be mediated in part by the formation of HNE adducts with progenitor proteins located within the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic compartments. Our data are the first to show that HNE can have direct, deleterious effects on oligodendrocyte precursors. The present study also suggests a mechanism by which the striking accumulation of HNE in white matter tracts surrounding the site of spinal cord compression injury and in other ischemic-hypoxic insults associated with MLP could suppress the potential regenerative response of endogenous oligodendrocyte progenitor cells.

AB  - Biomarker analysis and proteomic discovery in pediatric sickle cell disease has the potential to lead to important discoveries and improve care. The aim of this review article is to describe proteomic and biomarker articles involving neurological and developmental complications in this population. A systematic review was conducted to identify relevant research publications. Articles were selected for children under the age of 21 years with the most common subtypes of sickle cell disease. Included articles focused on growth factors (platelet-derived growth factor), intra and extracellular brain proteins (glial fibrillary acidic protein, brain-derived neurotrophic factor), and inflammatory and coagulation markers (interleukin-1?, l-selectin, thrombospondin-1, erythrocyte, and platelet-derived microparticles). Positive findings include increases in plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor and platelet-derived growth factor with elevated transcranial Dopplers velocities, increases in platelet-derived growth factor isoform AA with overt stroke, and increases in glial fibrillary acidic protein with acute brain injury. These promising potential neuro-biomarkers provide insight into pathophysiologic processes and clinical events, but their clinical utility is yet to be established. Additional proteomics research is needed, including broad-based proteomic discovery of plasma constituents and blood cell proteins, as well as urine and cerebrospinal fluid components, before, during and after neurological and developmental complications.

AB  - Abstract One of the most important requirements for calcium phosphate bone cements (CPBC) is remodelling in vivo. Degradation of the artificial material and the formation of native new bone matrix have to interdigitate to avoid instability. The remodelling process should not last longer than one year. In this study a CPBC was modified with O-phospho-L-serine (phosphoserine) to improve the material properties in order to speed up remodelling in vivo. The results showed that the modified cements exhibit a nano-crystalline microstructure with a high specific surface area and increased compressive strength (about 50?%). Metabolic activity of osteoblasts was improved on the modified material. Monocytes were found to be highly activated on the cements containing phosphoserine. In addition the formation of multinucleated giant cells (osteoclast-like cells) was not impaired on phosphoserine modified cement composites. In vivo experiments in Wistar rats and mini pigs clearly revealed that phosphoserine modified cements showed a higher capability of remodelling compared to the cements without phosphoserine.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Head injury causes significant morbidity and mortality, and there is contention about which patients to scan. The UK National Health Service Clinical Guideline (CG) 56 provides criteria for selecting patients with clinically important brain injury who may benefit from a head CT scan, while minimising the radiation and economic burden of scanning patients without significant injury. This study aims to audit the documentation of the use of these guidelines in a busy UK trauma hospital and discusses the comparison with an Australian (New South Wales (NSW) ) head injury guideline. Methods A retrospective cohort study of 480 patients presenting with head injury to the emergency department over 2 months was performed. The patient notes were assessed for documentation of each aspect of the clinical guidelines. Criteria were established to assess the utilisation of the CG 56. A database of clinical data was amalgamated with the head CT scan results for each patient. Results For the UK CG 56, 73% of the criteria were documented, with the least documented being ?signs of basal skull fracture? and ?amnesia of events?. Thirty-two per cent of patients received head CT and of these, 24% (37 patients) were reported to have pathology. Twenty-four patients underwent head CT without clinical justification being documented, none of which had reported pathology on CT. Conclusion The study shows that the head injury guidelines are not being fully utilised at a major UK trauma hospital, resulting in 5% of patients being exposed to ionising radiation without apparent documented clinical justification. The NSW guideline has distinct differences to the CG 56, with a more complex algorithm and an absence of specific time frames for head CT completion. The results suggest a need for further education and awareness of head injury clinical guidelines.

AB  - Summary Limitations to successful plasma therapy include constraints related to inventory, turnaround time, and volumes infused. For PCCs, availability of four-factor PCCs may be limited, and three-factor PCCs are not approved for replacement of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, except for factor IX. Close collaboration among critical care specialists, hematology, transfusion medicine, and pharmacy services is desirable for management of patients with complex coagulopathies. In the absence of clearly supportive evidence, physicians should exercise restraint in the use of rFVIIa in off-label settings. Physicians need to be encouraged to adapt their clinical practices with sound clinical evidence for use of each of the hemostatic/prothrombotic products.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the outcome of dogs with presumptive echocardiographic idiopathic pericardial effusion treated with thoracoscopic pericardectomy and pericardioscopy. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study (2011-2017). Animals Eighteen dogs. Methods Records were searched for dogs with pericardial effusion and no identified cause by preoperative echocardiography and subsequent thoracoscopic pericardectomy and pericardioscopy. Collected data included presenting complaint, physical examination, laboratory results, imaging, and operative findings. Follow-up was obtained via telephone interview and/or recheck examination. Results No evidence of mass lesions or cause for the effusion was identified in any of the dogs by preoperative echocardiography. Nine dogs had unremarkable pericardioscopic examination results. Nine dogs had pericardioscopic abnormalities consistent with masses, nodules, or adhesions. Median survival time (MST) for the 9 dogs with abnormalities identified by pericardioscopy was 66 days, whereas MST for the 9 dogs with unremarkable pericardioscopic examination results was not reached (P?=?.0067). Median survival time for dogs based on histopathologic diagnosis alone was not different between dogs with a diagnosis of neoplasia and dogs with a diagnosis of pericarditis (P?=?.1056). Among dogs with lesions identified during pericardioscopy, MST did not differ between those with a diagnosis of malignancy and those with a diagnosis of pericarditis (P?=?.78). Conclusion Dogs with presumptive idiopathic pericardial effusion without evidence of masses, nodules, and/or adhesions during thoracoscopic pericardectomy and pericardioscopy lived longer than dogs in which abnormalities were identified during pericardioscopy. Clinical significance Thoracoscopic pericardectomy/pericardioscopy and targeted biopsy of the pericardium and pleura are recommended in dogs with echocardiographic idiopathic pericardial effusion.

AB  - Summary Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome and telomere biology disorder characterized by dysplastic nails, reticular skin pigmentation and oral leucoplakia. Androgens are a standard therapeutic option for bone marrow failure in those patients with DC who are unable to undergo haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but there are no systematic data on its use in those patients. We evaluated haematological response and side effects of androgen therapy in 16 patients with DC in our observational cohort study. Untreated DC patients served as controls. Seventy percent of treated DC patients had a haematological response with red blood cell and/or platelet transfusion independence. The expected age-related decline in telomere length was noted in androgen-treated patients. All treated DC patients had at least one significant lipid abnormality. Additional treatment-related findings included a significant decrease in thyroid binding globulin, accelerated growth in pre-pubertal children and splenic peliosis in two patients. Liver enzymes were elevated in both androgen-treated and untreated patients, suggesting underlying liver involvement in DC. This study suggests that androgen therapy can be effectively used to treat bone marrow failure in DC, but that side effects need to be closely monitored.

AB  - Objectives To describe, in a cohort of dogs with presumed primary immune-mediated neutropenia, the presenting clinical characteristics, haematology results, bone marrow characteristics, therapies used (drugs and doses), clinical response to treatment, relapse and outcome at six months and one year. Methods Multi-institutional recruited retrospective descriptive case series with voluntary submissions. Presumed immune-mediated neutropenia was diagnosed based on a neutrophil concentration <1·5?109 cells/L on a minimum of two complete blood counts, exclusion of other causes of neutropenia based on a diagnostic bone marrow aspirate or biopsy, and exclusion of secondary immune-mediated neutropenia. Dogs meeting these diagnostic criteria between 2006 and 2013, and that had a haematocrit of ≥29% and minimum of two complete blood clounts performed after initiation of therapy, were included. Results Information on 35 dogs was included. Neutropenia was less than 0·5?109 cells/L in most cases (21 dogs), 0·5 to ·99?109 cells/L in 11, and 1.0 to 1·49?109 cells/L in three. Eight dogs had thrombocytopenia, which was severe (<49·9?109 cells/L) in three. [Correction added on 23 May 2017, after first online publication: the cell numbers were incorrect due to errors in the conversion of cell measurements to international units. The numbers have been corrected throughout the article and Table 2.] Twenty-three dogs had myeloid hyperplasia, 10 dogs had myeloid hypoplasia and two dogs had normal myelopoiesis. Neutropenia resolved in 32 of 33 dogs within two weeks of starting corticosteroid therapy and in all dogs within one month. Relapse of neutropenia occurred in 12 cases within one year. Clinical Significance Initial response of presumed primary immune-mediated neutropenia cases to corticosteroid therapy can be excellent. Long-term monitoring for relapse is warranted because 34% of cases relapsed during or after taper of immunosuppressive medications.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To collate and describe emergency admissions to a large animal tertiary university referral hospital during a 12-month period. Design: Prospective clinical study. Setting: Large animal tertiary university referral hospital. Animals: Large animal emergency patient admissions. Interventions: None. Measurements and main results: Information obtained from the medical record included the presenting complaint, clinical problem, admission time, duration of clinical signs before presentation, diagnostic procedures performed, therapies administered, and therapeutic procedures performed during the first 24 hours following admission, and survival to discharge. The most common category listed for the presenting complaint and clinical problem categories was gastrointestinal. Most emergency cases were admitted during the evening and in late spring, summer, and early fall. Most cases had a duration of clinical signs before presentation of >2 hours and ≤8 hours (27%) or >8 hours and ≤24 hours (29%). The most common diagnostic procedures performed during the first 24 hours were palpation per rectum, ultrasonographic examination, radiographs, and abdominocentesis. Antimicrobials, fluids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the most common therapies administered. Approximately 25% of cases required surgery. An exploratory celiotomy was performed in approximately 15% of cases. Enterotomy, intestinal resection and anastomosis, cesarean section, or joint or sheath lavage was each performed in <5% of cases. Overall survival to discharge was 74%. Conclusions: Large animal emergency clinicians are required to have knowledge on a wide range of diseases and should be proficient at performing numerous procedures on an emergency basis. Gastrointestinal disease is the most common type of emergency and the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures performed during the first 24 hours following admission are a reflection of this type of case. Only 25% of cases required surgery. Additional research in the form of a multicenter study and surveying both private and university practitioners needs to be performed to further define the necessary skills for an ?ideal? large animal emergency clinician.

AB  - Inflammatory cell recruitment into the central nervous system (CNS) is a critical step in the response to diverse insults, including infection, trauma and infarction, as well as immune-mediated disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Despite considerable advances in understanding immune surveillance and antigen recognition in the CNS, the signals resulting in parenchymal inflammation are incompletely understood. Members of a novel family of chemo-attractant cytokines, the chemokines, are made in the CNS and are emerging as likely mediators of inflammatory cell migration into the CNS.

AB  - SUMMARY Objectives To investigate the impact of a dedicated cell salvage practitioner team on blood loss and allogeneic transfusion in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery. Background Cell salvage reduces allogeneic transfusion in AAA surgery, but is commonly performed by the anaesthetic nurse. At our hospital, a dedicated patient blood management practitioner is present for all elective open AAA repairs. Methods/Materials Data were collected on 171 AAA patients operated on at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford over a 3-year period, looking at the Patient Blood Management processes, including: blood loss, cell salvage, near-patient testing (thrombelastography) and transfusion rates of allogeneic blood products. Results Blood loss ranged from 3?108% of estimated blood volume (EBV) (median 25%?=?1500?mL). In seven patients who lost 70?110% of their EBV, none reached the thrombelastography intervention threshold for R time (11?min) or MA (48?mm) despite such massive blood loss. Overall, only 7/171 (4%) patients received intra-operative allogeneic blood, all of whom had a mean baseline haemoglobin concentration?<?106?g L?1 (median 98, range 95?105?g L?1). In terms of other blood products, only 4/171 (2·3%) received one unit of platelets each intra-operatively. None received FFP or cryoprecipitate. Conclusions Such low levels of allogeneic transfusion have not been reported previously. We hypothesise that this is due to the additional blood management contributions of the specialised cell salvage practitioners and collaboration with the rest of the vascular surgical team. These results support the development of pre-operative anaemia clinics. Overall the service runs at a profit to the trust.

AB  - Abstract? Background: The traditional recommendation has been to stop Aspirin seven to 10 days prior to coronary artery bypass surgery to reduce the potential risk of bleeding. A few reports have shown that Aspirin did not increase the risk of bleeding and may be beneficial to be continued until the time of surgery. The objective of this review was to evaluate the effect of preoperative Aspirin on bleeding in patients undergoing elective bypass surgery. Methods: A meta-analysis of 10 randomized and nonrandomized studies reporting comparisons between Aspirin and control was undertaken. The primary outcome was the total amount of postoperative chest tube drainage. Secondary outcomes were the number of units of packed red blood cell transfusion, platelet transfusion, fresh frozen plasma transfusion, and number of patients reexplored for bleeding. Results: Ten studies, involving 1748 patients, met the inclusion criteria for this review of whom 913 were in the Aspirin group and 835 were in the control group. Pooling the results of all studies showed a significant increase in blood loss and transfusion of red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma in the Aspirin group (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the rate of platelet transfusion, or the incidence of reexploration (p > 0.05). Included studies were heterogeneous and of low methodological quality. Conclusion: Aspirin is associated with increased chest tube drainage and may be associated with a greater requirement for blood products. High-quality prospective studies are warranted to reassess the effect of Aspirin on important postoperative outcomes.
