AB  - Abstract Objectives The current 2017 ESC/EACTS guidelines recommend transcatheter aortic valve implantations (TAVIs) as the therapy of choice for inoperable patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Most of the TAVIs worldwide are performed under general anaesthesia (GA). Although conscious sedation (CS) concepts are increasingly applied in Europe, it is still a matter of debate which concept is associated with highest amount of safety for this high-risk patient population. The aim of this single center, before-and-after study was to investigate feasibility and safety of CS compared with GA with respect to peri-procedural complications and 30-day mortality in patients scheduled for transfemoral TAVI (TF-TAVI). Methods From March 2012 until September 2014, patients scheduled for the TF-TAVI procedure were included in a prospective, observational manner. From the 200 patients finally included, 107 procedures were performed under GA, using either an endotracheal tube or a laryngeal mask, and balanced anaesthesia. CS was performed in 93 patients using low-dose propofol and remifentanil. Results Conversion to GA was needed 4 times due to procedural-related complications (4.3%), in one patient due to ongoing agitation (1.1%). The CS-group showed significantly shorter key time courses: anaesthesia time (105 [95-120] minutes vs 115 [105-140] minutes, P-value = 0.009, Mann-Whitney-U-test) and length of stay in the intensive care unit (1.6 [1.0-1.5] d vs 2.1 [1.0-2.0] d, P-value = 0.002, Mann-Whitney-U-test). The lowest mean arterial pressure was significantly higher in the CS-group compared with the GA-group (74.3 mmHg vs 55.2 mmHg, P-value <0.0001, t-test). CS was associated with less requirements of norepinephrine (0.1 ?g/kg vs 2.3 ?g/kg, P-value <0.0001, Mann-Whitney-U-test). Conclusions Our single-center data demonstrate that CS is a feasible and safe alternative, especially with respect to a higher degree of intra-procedural haemodynamic stability, and a reduced length of stay in the intensive care unit.

AB  - Summary Background The role of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) in abdominal sepsis remains elusive. Objectives To study the influence of inhibition and over-expression of PAI-1 upon survival in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis. Methods (i) Mice underwent moderate CLP and received 10 mg kg?1 of either monoclonal anti-PAI-1 (MA-MP6H6) or control (MA-Control) antibody intravenously at 0, 18 or 30 h post-CLP. The 30-h treatment group was additionally stratified into mice predicted to survive (P-SUR) or die (P-DIE) based on IL 6 measured at 24 h post-CLP. (ii) PAI-1 expression was induced with pLIVE.PAI-1 plasmid administered 72 h pre-CLP. Blood was sampled for 5 days and survival was monitored for 28 days. Results MA-MP6H6 effectively neutralized active PAI-1 and fully restored fibrinolysis while PAI-1 over-expression was liver-specific and correlated with PAI-1 increase in the blood. Without stratification, MA-MP6H6 co-/post-treatment conferred no survival benefit. Prospective stratification (IL-6 cut-off: 14 ng mL?1) suggested increased mortality by MA-MP6H6 treatment in P-SUR that reached 30% difference (vs. MA-Control; P < 0.05) after a retrospective cut-off readjustment to 3.3 ng mL?1 for better P-SUR homogeneity. Subsequent prospective anti-PAI-1 treatment in P-SUR mice with 3.3 ng mL?1 cut-off demonstrated a negative but statistically insignificant effect: mortality was higher by 17% after MA-MP6H6 vs. MA-Control. Over-expression of PAI 1 did not alter post-CLP survival. Neither PAI-1 inhibition nor over-expression meaningfully modified inflammatory response and/or organ function. Conclusions Restoration of fibrinolysis in early abdominal sepsis was not beneficial and it may prove detrimental in subjects with the lowest risk of death, while preemptive PAI-1 up-regulation at the current magnitude was not protective.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Patients medicated with clopidogrel who require orthopaedic surgery present a particular challenge. Whether in an emergency or elective situation the orthopaedic surgeon must balance the risks of ceasing clopidogrel versus the risk of increased bleeding that dual antiplatelet therapy generates. Method:? This paper reviews the current published evidence regarding the risks of continuing clopidogrel, the risks of discontinuing clopidogrel and associated considerations such as venous thromboprophylaxis. Results:? Little good quality evidence exists in regard to perioperative clopidogrel for orthopaedic surgery. Available evidence across non-cardiac and cardiac surgery were assessed and presented in regards to current practices, blood loss for orthopaedic operations, risks when continuing clopidogrel, risks of stopping clopidogrel and also the consideration of venous thromboembolism. Conclusions:? The patients at greatest risk, when discontinuing clopidogrel therapy, are those with drug eluting stents who may be at risk of stent thrombosis. Where possible, efforts should be made to continue clopidogrel therapy through the perioperative period, taking precautions to minimize bleeding. If the risk of bleeding is too high, antiplatelet therapy must be reinstated as soon as considered reasonable after surgery. In addition, patients on clopidogrel who sustain a fall or other general trauma need to be carefully assessed because of the possibility of occult bleeding, such as into the retroperitoneal space. Until more definitive evidence becomes available, this review aims to provide a guide for the orthopaedic surgeon in dealing with the difficult dilemma of the patient on clopidogrel therapy, recommending that orthopaedic surgeons take a team approach to assess the individual risks for all patients and consider continuation of clopidogrel therapy perioperatively where possible.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Blood transfusion has often been shown to reduce cancer survival, however, the mechanism of this effect is unknown. We have measured antiangiogenic agent endostatin, the proangiogenic growth factors, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in various blood products and assessed their effect upon tumour and endothelial cell growth to attempt to explain this clinical finding. Methods: Blood products as supplied by the blood bank were maintained at 4 C and every 72 h was centrifuged at 3000 r.p.m. for 15 min, the supernatant underwent measurement of endostatin, bFGF and VEGF by ELISAs. A standard MTS assay measured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECS) and colorectal cancer cell (Caco-2) proliferation from incubated stored blood supernatant compared to control and cancer patients plasma. Results: Endostatin in packed red blood cells (2100 pg/mL ± 810) became undetectable within one week of storage, during which time platelets increased bFGF levels by fourfold (4.4 ± 1.9 versus 17.4 ± 4.5 pg/mL, P < 0.001). Plasma from whole blood contained significantly more VEGF (73.6 pg/mL ± 5.0) than leucodepleted packed cells (22.6 pg/mL ± 1.2, P < 0.01). HUVECS and Caco-2 cells increased proliferation upon incubation with stored blood supernatant compared to patient plasma (P < 0.05); an effect inhibited by anti-VEGF antibody (P < 0.05). Conclusions: During storage, blood products become proangiogenic stimulating both cancer cells and endothelial proliferation in vitro. These findings may have clinical significance in terms of the detrimental effects blood products contribute to cancer patients survival.

AB  - Abstract Patients with fulminant hepatic failure have low levels of the plasma opsonizing protein fibronectin together with cardiovascular disturbances similar to those in septic shock where microembolization of capillary beds by particulate debris has been proposed to lead to multi-organ failure. Six patients with fulminant hepatic failure received a bolus injection of a concentrated fibronectin-rich preparation. The mean plasma immunoreactive fibronectin level increased from 53 ± SE 12 ?g ml-1 initially to 295 ± 30 ?g ml-1 (P < 0·001) at 1 h after fibronectin administration. The in vitro plasma opsonic activity was also increased from 5·6 ± 3·6% of control to 102 ± 13% (P < 0·005) at 1 h. No similar effect was observed with the clearance of microaggregated albumin, but as its clearance is probably not dependent on fibronectin it may reflect a different aspect of reticuloendothelial cell function. No significant changes were observed in cardiopulmonary function or oxygen utilization and it is possible this is because clearance of opsonized particles is limited by damage to Kupffer cells.

AB  - Inherent and acquired resistance of cancer cells is increasingly recognized as a significant impediment to effective radiation cancer treatment. As important intracellular factors, aberrant tumor transmembrane signal transduction pathways, which include the prosurvival cascades (PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK and JAK/STAT) and the proapoptosis pathways (Wnt, p53 and TNF-α/NF-?B), have been proved to be crucial determinants of the probability of cell sensitivity to radiation in malignant lesions. There is increasing evidence that targeting the abnormal pathways that can regulate the activity of the DNA damage response and further influence the response of tumor cells to radiation may be suitable for improving radiation sensitization. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that agents targeting aberrant tumor signals can effectively improve the therapeutic effect of ionizing radiation. Therefore, in this review, we discuss the intricate interplay between tumor responses to radiation with the aberrant signal pathways, and the potential druggable targets within the pathways to sensitize tumors without significant collateral damage to normal tissues. The application of novel targeting compounds to manipulate the aberrant signal of tumor cells in clinical treatments is also addressed.

AB  - Spontaneous papillary muscle rupture (PMR) is a rare cardiovascular emergency. We present a 63-year-old male who presents with acute dyspnea who was found to have an anterior PMR, with no evidence of coronary artery disease, infection, or trauma. A review of cases of nonischemic spontaneous PMR published in 2000?2015 identified 11 additional cases of spontaneous PMR. Posterior and anterior papillary muscles involvement was identified in 54.5% and 45.5% of cases, respectively. Rapid identification due to advances in imaging modalities and improved surgical management has led to optimal outcomes in patients with spontaneous PMR.

AB  - Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is an uncommon disease marked by clotting of blood in cerebral venous, or dural sinuses, and, in rare cases, cortical veins. It is a rare but potentially fatal cause of acute neurological deterioration previously related to otomastoid, orbit, and central face cutaneous infections. After the advent of antibiotics, it is more often related to neoplasm, pregnancy, puerperium, systemic diseases, dehydration, intracranial tumors, oral contraceptives, and coagulopathies are the most common causes, but in 30% of cases no underlying etiology can be identified. It has been found in association with fibrous thyroiditis, jugular thrombosis after catheterization, or idiopathic jugular vein stenosis. Other factors include surgery, head trauma, arterio-venous malformations, infection, paraneoplastic, and autoimmune disease. This article presents a comprehensive review of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis etiologies.

AB  - A 43-year-old female with progressive systemic sclerosis developed painful subcutaneous nodules proximally on her extremities which spread distally to her shins. Initially tender, they became red and evolved to painless, red-brown nodules. She had been taking penicillamine for 19 months and was on no other medication or supplements. History and physical exam revealed no evidence of infection, trauma, injection, or significant travel. Incisional biopsy of an acute nodule demonstrated septal panniculitis, with extensive lipomembranous change, and an associated brisk granulomatous infiltrate with multinucleated foreign-body like giant cells. Deeper adipose tissue demonstrated fibrosed thickened septae with an inflammatory cell infiltrate, consistent with scleroderma profundus. Further studies revealed no infectious organisms, or refractile material. The lesions cleared 3 weeks after stopping penicillamine. She declined a re-challenge and has been disease free for a year. Lipomembranous fat changes are identified in about 5% of subcutaneous inflammatory disorders; most frequently in venous insufficiency, and also with morphea, lupus pannicultis, erythema nodosum, necrobiosis lipoidica and trauma. Panniculitis with lipomembranous fat changes similar to this case has been reported in a patient with systemic sclerosis on norethisterone acetate. This is a rare and interesting case of penicillamine-induced panniculitis.

AB  - Abstract Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) are a recent innovation in the management of portal hypertension. In 1992, we had previously described an instance of severe hemolysis associated with this procedure. This study was undertaken to define and quantify the true incidence of TIPS-associated hemolysis and its clinical spectrum, as well as to test the hypothesis that portal decompression by TIPS would ameliorate hypersplenism in patients with portal hypertension. A total of 60 patients undergoing TIPS for prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage (n = 40) or refractory ascites (n = 20) were studied. Forty patients with cirrhosis who were followed concurrently served as controls. At entry, both groups were comparable with the exception of increased ascites in the TIPS group. A total of 7 instances of intravascular hemolysis were identified in 60 TIPS patients, whereas none occurred in controls. Of these, 4 patients were asymptomatic and detected on routine laboratory testing. Hemolysis led to a greater than 4-g/dL decrease in hemoglobin in 2 patients, 2- to 3-g/dL decrease in 2 others and a 3- to 4-gm/dL decrease in 1 patient. Two patients were able to compensate for hemolysis and did not develop anemia. In all but 1 case, the findings of hemolysis subsided by 12 to 15 weeks; in 1 patient, orthotopic liver transplantation was associated with resolution of the hemolysis. Overall, no significant changes in white blood cell or platelet counts were observed in patients undergoing TIPS despite adequate portal decompression. We conclude that TIPS-induced hemolysis occurs in approximately 10% of subjects. However, it is self-limited and rarely requires intervention. Potential mechanisms of such hemolysis are discussed. TIPS is also not recommended as a means of improving platelet counts in patients with severe hypersplenism.

AB  - Abstract Organs available for solid organ transplantation are mainly procured from brain dead donors. The inflammation associated with brain death may reduce organ quality and increase organ immunogenicity, thus leading to inferior recipient outcome. We hypothesized that the extensive surgical procedure performed during multiorgan procurement enhances the levels of systemic inflammatory biomarkers. We measured the levels of 27 cytokines and the terminal complement complex (TCC) in plasma samples from brain dead organ donors (n = 34) drawn before and at three specific time points during procurement surgery. Baseline levels of G-CSF, interferon-?, IL-1ra, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IP-10, MCP-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1?, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), regulated upon activation T cell expressed and secreted, and tumor necrosis factor-α were significantly elevated in brain dead donors compared with normal individuals (n = 14), but they were not associated with time on ventilator or any other registered clinical variable. Notably, the secretion of G-CSF, IL1-ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1?, PDGF, and TCC, the latter reflecting ongoing complement activation, increased significantly during surgery. None of the biomarker increases were correlated with operation duration. Multiorgan procurement surgery significantly adds to the inflammatory response revealed by both pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers associated with brain death. Future studies should determine whether this is associated with inferior recipient outcome.

AB  - We describe a case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma with features overlapping between the myofibromatosis and the myopericytoma type. The patient is a 58-year-old female with a painless plaque-like and multinodular lesion in the pretibial dermis. She reported repeated trauma to this site, first in her early youth that left an area of hyperpigmentation, and then again at age 40. She had noticed the appearance of nodules in this area 5 years prior to presentation, which had increased in size and number over the last six months. The biopsy showed a biphasic pattern with a myofibromatosis type component composed of spindle cell myoid nodules and more cellular round cell areas. The myopericytoma-like areas appeared to be infiltrating along vessels. These areas contained aggregates of immature cells arranged concentrically around vascular lumina reminiscent of pericytes. Immunohistochemical stains showed focal positivity for smooth muscle actin. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies have shown these pericyte-like cells to be of a myoid origin. The reason for the neoplastic proliferation of perivascular myoid cells is presently unknown. The association of trauma and neoplastic transformation of the skin is rare. We report the first case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma arising in a chronic scar.
