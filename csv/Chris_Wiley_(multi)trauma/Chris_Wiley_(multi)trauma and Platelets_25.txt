AB  - We describe a case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma with features overlapping between the myofibromatosis and the myopericytoma type. The patient is a 58-year-old female with a painless plaque-like and multinodular lesion in the pretibial dermis. She reported repeated trauma to this site, first in her early youth that left an area of hyperpigmentation, and then again at age 40. She had noticed the appearance of nodules in this area 5 years prior to presentation, which had increased in size and number over the last six months. The biopsy showed a biphasic pattern with a myofibromatosis type component composed of spindle cell myoid nodules and more cellular round cell areas. The myopericytoma-like areas appeared to be infiltrating along vessels. These areas contained aggregates of immature cells arranged concentrically around vascular lumina reminiscent of pericytes. Immunohistochemical stains showed focal positivity for smooth muscle actin. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies have shown these pericyte-like cells to be of a myoid origin. The reason for the neoplastic proliferation of perivascular myoid cells is presently unknown. The association of trauma and neoplastic transformation of the skin is rare. We report the first case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma arising in a chronic scar.

AB  - Objective To identify risk factors for dehiscence in stapled functional end-to-end anastomoses (SFEEA) in dogs. Study Design Retrospective case series. Animals Dogs (n?=?53) requiring an enterectomy. Methods Medical records from a single institution for all dogs undergoing an enterectomy (2001?2012) were reviewed. Surgeries were included when gastrointestinal (GIA) and thoracoabdominal (TA) stapling equipment was used to create a functional end-to-end anastomosis between segments of small intestine or small and large intestine in dogs. Information regarding preoperative, surgical, and postoperative factors was recorded. Results Anastomotic dehiscence was noted in 6 of 53 cases (11%), with a mortality rate of 83%. The only preoperative factor significantly associated with dehiscence was the presence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Surgical factors significantly associated with dehiscence included the presence, duration, and number of intraoperative hypotensive periods, and location of anastomosis, with greater odds of dehiscence in anastomoses involving the large intestine. Conclusion IBD, location of anastomosis, and intraoperative hypotension are risk factors for intestinal anastomotic dehiscence after SFEEA in dogs. Previously suggested risk factors (low serum albumin concentration, preoperative septic peritonitis, and intestinal foreign body) were not confirmed in this study.

AB  - Summary Therapeutic apheresis is one of the few areas of Transfusion Medicine involving direct patient care. This can involve exchange transfusions of plasma or red cells, therapeutic cytoreduction in clinical situations with abnormal accumulations of blood cells, usually myeloid or platelets, selective removal of offending molecules such as lipoproteins, or treatment of mononuclear cells with photochemical technology to treat immune diseases. Plasma exchange is used in a variety of immune diseases while red cell exchange is almost exclusively done in patients with sickle cell disease. The mechanism of action of photopheresis in not well understood but it is used in one lymphoid malignance, graft rejection and GVHD. The processes of therapeutic apheresis can be complex especially since some of the patients are quite ill. This chapter reviews the techniques and the clinical use of these procedures.

AB  - Although excessive consumption of ethanol in alcoholic beverages causes multi-organ damage, moderate consumption, particularly of red wine, is protective against all-cause mortality. These protective effects could be due to one or many components of the complex mixture of bioactive compounds present in red wine including flavonols, monomeric and polymeric flavan-3-ols, highly colored anthocyanins as well as phenolic acids and the stilbene polyphenol, resveratrol. The therapeutic potential of resveratrol, firstly in cancer chemoprevention and then later for cardioprotection, has stimulated many studies on the possible mechanisms of action. Further indications for resveratrol have been developed, including the prevention of age-related disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. These improvements are remarkably similar yet there is an important dichotomy: low doses improve cell survival as in cardio- and neuro-protection yet high doses increase cell death as in cancer treatment. Fewer studies have examined the responses to other components of red wine, but the results have, in general, been similar to resveratrol. If the nonalcoholic constitutents of red wine are to become therapeutic agents, their ability to get to the sites of action needs to be understood. This mini-review summarizes recent studies on the possible mechanisms of action, potential therapeutic uses, and bioavailability of the nonalcoholic constituents of alcoholic beverages, in particular resveratrol and other polyphenols.

AB  - Orbital cysts include the common epidermoid and dermoid cysts, cysts of conjunctival origin and cysts lined by respiratory-type epithelium. Respiratory epithelial cysts are exceedingly rare and have been reported in common locations for dermoid cysts (superotemporal and superonasal anterior orbit) and in sites atypical for dermoid cysts. Most represent maxillary sinus mucoceles extending into the orbital floor. In some patients, a history of orbital trauma or previous sinus surgery has been implicated in the implantation of the respiratory epithelium in the orbit. Rarely, the respiratory epithelial cyst has been considered to be a choristoma. We report the case of a 72-year-old woman who presented with a cyst in the anterior superotemporal orbit. There was no history of recent or remote trauma. The clinical impression was of a dermoid cyst. Histopathologic examination revealed a cyst lined by non-keratinizing squamous epithelium. A few goblet cells were present and focally, short strips of ciliated mucin secreting columnar cells were identified. The histopathologic findings were those of a respiratory epithelial cyst of the orbit. Given the rarity of this entity, valuable information can be gleaned from critical evaluation and reporting of new cases, in the context of existing data in the literature.

AB  - Abstract Introduction There is limited evidence regarding clinical research priorities in emergency medicine outside of some special interest groups. The ACEM Clinical Trials Group undertook a consensus meeting with the aim of developing a reproducible weighting matrix for assessing clinical research priorities. Methods A session at the ACEM annual scientific meeting was dedicated to this meeting. Results from a survey of the ACEM researcher database were presented, along with a proposed weighting matrix. After discussion and adjustment, consensus was achieved on the matrix. Results It was agreed that the following criteria be used in the matrix: research category and sub-category priority ranking from the ACEM researcher database survey, frequency of presentation of potentially eligible participants, the level of pre-existing evidence regarding the proposed research question and the likely clinical impact of the research. Each criterion was given a weighting, with clinical impact given the heaviest weighting. The weighting matrix was subsequently applied to the list of research questions that resulted from the researcher database survey and a list of research priorities determined. Conclusion The weighting matrix allows reproducible comparison of research questions. The resultant list of research priorities will act as a guide for the ACEM Clinical Trials Group in determining future projects.

AB  - Summary Ascites is the most common complication of cirrhosis resulting in poor quality of life, high risk of development of other complications of cirrhosis, increased morbidity and mortality associated with surgical interventions, and poor long-term outcome. The practical management of ascites involves a proper evaluation of the patient with a thorough history and physical exam. In addition, complete laboratory, ascitic fluid, radiological, endoscopic, and in some cases histological tests should be performed. Taking proper care of patients with ascites can be challenging because they are prone to several complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hypervolemic hyponatremia, hepatic hydrothorax, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and hepatocellular carcinoma, bleeding from esophageal or gastric varices, and hepatic encephalopathy. While the initial management of uncomplicated ascites with low-sodium diet and diuretic treatment is straightforward in the majority of patients, there is a group of patients that fail to respond to diuretics and become a real therapeutic challenge.

AB  - Nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, a cutaneous hamartoma, results from disordered development of epidermal, follicular, sebaceous and apocrine differentiation that typically appears as a yellow verrucous plaque on the scalp or face. We present a 36-year-old white male with a congenital, nodular lesion along the hairline of his forehead, which had been traumatized repeatedly during hair grooming. Clinically, it was a well-demarcated, curvilinear, erythematous, non-tender plaque with no umbilication, ulceration or discharge. The periphery had a circumferential tan-yellow, raised, waxy serpiginous border. Microscopically, the specimen had epidermal papillomatous hyperplasia with dilated infundibula of irregular mature sebaceous lobules, and mid-dermal apocrine gland lobules. Within the hamartoma, was a well-circumscribed, multi-lobulated dermal tumor with epidermal and follicular attachments, focal ductal differentiation and cystic changes. Two distinct cell types were present; in the center were large polyhedral cells with focal clear cytoplasm, and at the periphery were spindle-shaped cells with basophilic cytoplasm. These findings were typical of nodular hidradenoma arising within a nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, a rare event with only seven cases previously documented in the literature.

AB  - Retinal haemorrhages (RH) in a young child suggest child abuse, yet other causes merit consideration. This systematic review addresses non-traumatic causes of RH in children with one or more overlapping clinical features of abuse (bruising, fractures, intracranial haemorrhage). Searching 12 databases (1950?2009) identified 338 studies for review by two reviewers. Inclusion criteria included: children?<?15?years examined by an ophthalmologist detailing retinal findings, confirmed organic cause and exclusion of abuse. Exclusion criteria included: diagnosed coagulopathy, ocular mass lesion and post-mortem cases. Twenty included studies identified nine relevant conditions (metabolic diseases, bony dysplasias, bleeding disorders and vascular malformations). Where detailed, the RH were bilateral and involved only one area of the retina (the posterior pole). Among proposed confounders of RH, no child with a cough (100 children) or acute life-threatening event (184 cases) had RH. Just two of 217 children with seizures had posterior pole RH, one unilateral and one bilateral. One cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) study (43 cases) was included where a child with co-existent clotting abnormalities had tiny (bilateral dot) RH after 60 minutes? resuscitation. Child abuse remains the commonest cause of RH in young children, although rarer disorders merit consideration. There are insufficient data to conclude that CPR is a confounder in children with RH. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ?Searching 12 databases (1950?2009) identified 338 studies for review? ?There are insufficient data to conclude that CPR is a confounder in children with RH? Key Practitioner Message Retinal Haemorrhages are strongly associated with Abusive Head Trauma, but have been described in certain medical conditions. Neither cough nor ALTE are associated with RH, which have been found in <?3% of children with seizures. There are inadequate data to conclude that CPR is associated with RH. Case series have reported RH in children who also have clinical features that may overlap with physical abuse, namely certain metabolic, vascular, haematologic disorders and bony dysplasias (specifically osteogenesis imperfecta).
