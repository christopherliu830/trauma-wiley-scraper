AB  - Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) occurs in â‰¤12% of pediatric recipients of liver transplantation (LT). Known complications of PVT include portal hypertension, allograft loss, and mortality. The management of PVT is varied. A single-center, case-control study of pediatric LT recipients with portal vein (PV) changes after LT was performed. Cases were categorized as early PVT (if PVT was detected within 30 days of transplantation) or late PVT (if PVT was detected more than 30 days after transplantation or if early PVT persisted beyond 30 days). Two non-PVT control patients were matched on the basis of the recipient weight, transplant indication, and allograft type to each patient with PVT. Thirty-two of the 415 LT recipients (7.7%) received 37 allografts and developed PVT. In comparison with control patients, a higher proportion of patients with PVT had PVT present before LT (13.3% versus 0%, P = 0.01). Patients with early PVT usually returned to the operating room, and 9 of 15 patients (60%) had PV flow restored. Patients with late PVT had lower white blood cell (4.9 [1000/?L] versus 6.8 [1000/?L], P < 0.01) and platelet counts (140 [1000/?L] versus 259 [1000/?L], P < 0.01), an elevated international normalized ratio (1.2 versus 1.0, P < 0.001), and more gastrointestinal bleeding (25% versus 8.3%, P = 0.03) compared to controls. Patients with PVT were also less frequently at the expected grade level (52% versus 88%, P < 0.001). The patient survival rates were 84%, 78%, and 78% and 91%, 84%, and 79% for cases and controls at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The allograft survival rates were 90%, 80%, and 80% for cases and 94%, 89%, and 87% for controls at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. In conclusion, patients with early and late PVT had preserved allograft function, and there was no impact on mortality. Patients diagnosed with early PVT often underwent operative interventions with successful restoration of flow. Patients diagnosed with late PVT experienced variceal bleeding, and some required portosystemic shunting procedures. Academic delays were also more common. In late PVT, the clinical presentation dictates care because the optimal management algorithm has not yet been determined. Multi-institutional studies are needed to confirm these findings and improve patient outcomes. Liver Transpl 19:315?321, 2013. ? 2013 AASLD.

KW  - transfusion-related acute lung injury
PY  - 2011
AB  - Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is one of the most serious complications of blood transfusion. We have been gathering information about TRALl in Japan since 1997 through our national haemovigilance system. Recently, we have 20?40 TRALI cases per year (five million bags issued per year). Although TRALI is a rare complication of transfusion, it may become severe and may sometimes be fatal. A substantial number of TRALI cases have been caused by donor HLA or HNA antibodies, which were generated in alloimmunized, i.e. parous females. Considering this mechanism, TRALI mitigation strategies such as the use of male-only-plasma have been implemented in many blood centres or countries. Because of the availability of male plasma and the time limit for the production of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), we first tried to prepare FFP-LR2 derived from 400?ml whole blood only from male donors. FFP-LR2 accounts for 75% of FFP in Japan. (Six per cent of FFP products are from 200?ml whole blood and 19% from apheresis plasma.) A preliminary project on male-predominant plasma was started at several core blood centres. To minimize the burden on nurses regarding marking bags collected from males or females, which might lead to serious errors in collection sites, we updated the computer system that allows the staff members in the production department to sort male and female blood automatically. In a month after the system implementation nationwide, we successfully increased the production rate of male plasma for FFP-LR2 product by up to more than 98%. Regarding FFP-LR1 derived from 200?ml whole blood, the percentage of female donors is approximately 75%. One of the core blood centres has successfully implemented the same strategy for producing FFP-LR1, but others have not done so yet. Although male-only-plasma strategies achieved good results without any expensive screening tests to reduce TRALI incidence in some countries, the standard measures for other plasma rich blood products such as platelet concentrates or apheresis plasma have not been established yet. There are some measures to consider reducing the risk of TRALI caused by other plasma-rich products ? recruiting only males as apheresis platelet donors, testing a certain number of donors for HLA antibodies, replacing the supernatant of a platelet pool with male plasma and excluding female donors from apheresis donations. Some blood centres adopted some of these measures, but so far there is little evidence for the efficacy of these measures for reducing the risk of TRALI. We have recently conducted research about the relationship between strength of HLA antibodies and TRALI development. On the basis of the results of the research, we can set the cut-off level in HLA antibody tests, which can reduce the risk of TRALI by eliminating strong HLA antibodies that presumably cause TRALI development if the specificity of an antibody matches the patient?s antigen. Preliminary screening for donor HLA antibodies is ongoing in three core blood centres in Japan, results of which enable us to establish effective and feasible screening strategies for HLA antibodies in the near future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recombinant FVIIa (rFVIIa/NovoSeven) is a novel hemostatic agent originally developed to treat patients with hemophilia who had developed inhibitors. Several case reports have suggested that rFVIIa may be effective in treating patients without a pre-existing bleeding disorder who have uncontrolled bleeding. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data on the efficacy and safety of rFVIIa in the treatment of massive hemorrhage were obtained retrospectively from the NovoSeven extended-use data collection system. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients received rFVIIa for uncontrolled bleeding, and in these patients, bleeding stopped or decreased in 32 (80%). Blood product usage was significantly decreased after rFVIIa administration. Thromboembolic events occurred in three patients with additional risk factors for thrombosis. Of 40 patients, 23 (57.5%) died. Bleeding was the direct cause of death in seven cases (all within 24 hr of administration of rFVIIa). The remaining 16 deaths were the result of sepsis, multi-organ failure, or the underlying disease. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective study of data voluntarily submitted to a web-based drug surveillance program, we present preliminary results on the use of rFVIIa in nonhemophilia patients with bleeding. Although some efficacy is suggested, there was a high mortality rate from nonhemorrhagic causes. Randomized controlled trials are needed to properly assess the role of rFVIIa in the management of hemorrhage.

AB  - A novel murine experimental wound infection model was used to assess the efficacy of multi-component immunization against Staphylococcus aureus infection. Necrotic lesions were induced in mice with venom from Bothrops asper and infected with a low inoculum, 1Â ?Â 102Â CFU. The wound infection model therefore more resembles a clinical case of S. aureus infection compared with conventional infection models where far more bacteria are required. Before infection, mice were immunized with four recombinant S.aureus proteins expressed from Escherichia coli: (i) domains 1?3 of Extracellular adherence protein (Eap), (ii) Efb ? D (fusion protein combining Extracellular fibrinogen binding protein (Efb) and a fibronectin binding domain (D) of the fibronectin binding protein (FnBP) and (iii) clumping factor A (ClfA). In the immunized group, lower bacterial colonization, undisturbed crust formation and significantly faster wound healing were found compared with the unimmunized control group. Efb and Eap have previously been found to impair wound healing and neutralization of these proteins by antibodies restores a more natural wound healing process. This effect is further also enhanced by the proposed opsonic activity of antibodies against ClfA and FnBP.

AB  - Abstract We report a fatal case of acute gastric dilatation in a 3-year old boy who presented with severe abdominal pain and massive gastric distension in the emergency room. On physical examination the patient was in shock due to acute abdomen and lower limb ischemia. Initial laboratory findings showed multi-organ failure with acute renal failure and pancreatitis. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed marked dilatation of the stomach resulting in compression of the abdominal aorta. The left kidney, spleen and pancreas were not visible on CT due to the necrotic changes. The patient was quickly stabilized by initial volume resuscitation, but suddenly deteriorated immediately after gastric decompression via nasogastric tube, and died from multi-organ failure 3?h after initial presentation.

AB  - Background The objectives of this study were to estimate the frequency of occult upper gastrointestinal abnormalities, presence of gastric acid as a contributing factor, and associations with clinical outcomes. Methods Data were extracted for study participants at a single centre who had an endoscopy performed purely for research purposes and in whom treating physicians were not suspecting gastrointestinal bleeding. Endoscopic data were independently adjudicated by two gastroenterologists who rated the likelihood that observed pathological abnormalities were related to gastric acid secretion using a 3-point ordinal scale (unlikely, possible or probable). Results Endoscopy reports were extracted for 74 patients [age 52 (37, 65) years] undergoing endoscopy on day 5 [3, 9] of ICU admission. Abnormalities were found in 25 (34%) subjects: gastritis/erosions in 10 (14%), nasogastric tube trauma in 8 (11%), oesophagitis in 4 (5%) and non-bleeding duodenal ulceration in 3 (4%). The contribution of acid secretion to observed pathology was rated ?probable? in six subjects (rater #1) and five subjects (rater #2). Prior to endoscopy, 39 (53%) patients were receiving acid-suppressive therapy. The use of acid-suppressive therapy was not associated with the presence of an endoscopic abnormality (present 15/25 (60%) vs. absent 24/49 (49%); P = 0.46). Haemoglobin concentrations, packed red cells transfused and mortality were not associated with mucosal abnormalities (P = 0.83, P > 0.9 and P > 0.9 respectively). Conclusions Occult mucosal abnormalities were observed in one-third of subjects. The presence of mucosal abnormalities appeared to be independent of prior acid-suppressive therapy and was not associated with reduced haemoglobin concentrations, increased transfusion requirements, or mortality.

AB  - Summary Sutures play an important role in wound repair by supporting healing tissues. Understanding the various characteristics of suture materials enables appropriate selection. However, no single suture material is ideal, and compromises must be made. Proper suture placement, using specific patterns, generally ensures a predictable progression of wound healing and of scar formation. Drains, when properly applied, may help to prevent or at least lessen complications during healing. Sutures and drains are not substitutes for proper wound management because they cannot compensate for poor cleansing, debridement, and wound irrigation. Moreover, inappropriate use of sutures and drains may delay healing and may lead to scarring.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides an evidence-based overview of the state-of-the-art procedures with a focus on surgical retreatment, while contrasting the differences with traditional, historic techniques and other surgical endodontic procedures. Most odontogenic periapical lesions, including granulomas, cysts, and abscesses will respond positively to appropriate non-surgical retreatment. Local anesthesia in endodontic surgery is used for both profound analgesia and hemostasis. Guided surgery techniques using 3D-printed stents created from cone beam computed tomography scans and impressions have allowed easier access to surgical sites in intimate proximity of sensitive anatomical structures. Apical curettage involves the removal of the soft tissue lesion of the apical periodontitis around the root tip without root-end resection or root-end filling. The usefulness of guided tissue regeneration to improve the periodontal status of a tooth has been demonstrated by histologic and clinical outcome studies. Osseous healing after surgical intervention will require hemostasis, by vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the pediatric surgery. Emergent surgical airways in children carry a higher risk of complications compared with adults. These include injury to the airway, tube misplacement or dislodgment, and longer-term risks of subglottic stenosis. A cuffed tube in the trachea is the only ?definitive? airway, although temporary airway devices such as the laryngeal mask airway or combined esophageal/tracheal tubes can provide initial airway control and oxygenation/ventilation until a definitive airway can be established. Younger children have a higher incidence of higher level cervical spine injuries. Burn-related injuries are much less common, but are a cause of significant morbidity and often lifelong disability. Risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the pediatric population are parenteral nutrition supplementation, central venous catheter, deep sedation, and neuromuscular blockade.

AB  - Abstract Current published guidelines for perioperative pharmacy services have limited information on the development and implementation of a robust clinical pharmacy program across the surgical continuum of care. This publication defines the responsibilities and scope of practice of the Perioperative Clinical Pharmacist (PCPh), supporting the PCPh as a critical member of the interprofessional surgical patient care team. Opportunities for pharmacist role integration into perioperative medication management processes are described along with published examples of successful PCPh practice models, including those with interventions targeted toward Enhanced Recovery Pathways (ERP). Recommended training and competencies for future and practicing perioperative pharmacists, in addition to considerations for precepting and scholarly activities, are also outlined. Finally, future developments in perioperative pharmacy practice are discussed, including technological advancements, improved predictive models, and expansion of collaborative practice agreements.

AB  - Abstract The present series of experiments demonstrate that a polypeptide activity present in rat serum induces a proliferative response in cultured rat Schwann cells. Schwann cells in multi-well tissue culture plates were incubated in medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and serial dilutions of normal rat serum, and control preparations were incubated in the same culture medium without rat serum. Rates of cell proliferation were assayed by measuring DNA incorporation of tritiated thymidine using liquid scintillation counting. A prominent dose-dependent proliferative response was observed among Schwann cells incubated with rat serum and rat plasma dilutions as compared to controls; this activity is abolished by heat inactivation and by proteolytic digestion, and was not affected by dialysis against a cellulose ester membrane that excludes molecules larger than 10,000 daltons. In contrast, no increase in DNA uptake of tritiated thymidine was observed when astrocyte and oligodendrocyte cultures were incubated with serial dilutions of rat serum. No proliferative effect was observed when rat Schwann cells were incubated with a dilution of standard adult bovine serum. These results suggest there is an intravascular plasma polypeptide with a molecular weight greater than 10,000 daltons that specifically stimulates Schwann cell proliferation, and it is proposed that this factor may be the mitogen responsible for the Schwann cell proliferative response known to occur after nerve injury. ? 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes various abdominal vein thromboses, their clinical implications, and strategies of treatment. Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is a heterogeneous group of diseases that includes hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome, BCS), portal (PVT), splenic and mesenteric vein thrombosis (MVT). The optimal management of SVT requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes hepatologists, experts on thrombosis, radiologists and surgeons. In the paediatric population, renal vein thrombosis (RVT) is the most prevalent non catheter-related thrombosis during the neonatal period. For patients with RVT, a medical therapy, instead of a surgical approach (thrombectomy or nephrectomy), is recommended. Ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) is a rare condition most commonly diagnosed in the post-partum period. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) followed by vitamin K antagonists (VKA) are generally recommended for 3-6 months in the presence of transient risk factors, whereas a prolonged duration is suggested for idiophatic OVT, cancer-related OVT, and in patients with severe thrombophilia abnormalities.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective To study the effect of daily treatment with 50 mg of aspirin (ASA) on the hypertensive pregnancy complications and on the production prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane A2 (TxA2) in high risk pregnant women and their infants. Design Placebo controlled prospective study. Setting Departments of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Helsinki, University of Oulu and Central Hospital of Middle Finland, Finland. Subjects Two hundred and eight pregnant women with pre-existing hypertension or a history of severe preeclampsia in their previous pregnancy. Prostanoids were studied in a subgroup of 18 women. Interventions The women were randomised to receive ASA (50 mg/day, n= 103) or placebo (n= 105) from the mean of 15 weeks gestational age to delivery. The exacerbation of pre-existing hypertension or the appearance of hypertension in previously normotensive women, the appearance of proteinuria and fetal growth were the main end points, but some other clinical characteristics were also recorded. Urinary excretion of PGI2 and TxA2 metabolites by mothers and infants and their production in umbilical arteries in vitro were also studied. Results Two women (one in both groups) had miscarriages, and one pregnancy was terminated for fetal anencephaly (ASA group). In addition, seven women discontinued the treatment due to urticaria (two women in ASA group), increased activity of aspartate amino tranferase in serum (one woman in both groups), or increased bleeding time (one woman in ASA group, two women in placebo group), and one woman in the placebo group was lost from follow-up. Thus the end points could be assessed in 97 women taking ASA and 100 women taking placebo. ASA did not diminish the rate of the rise of blood pressure without (12 vs 14, respectively) or with proteinuria (9 vs 11), but fetal haemodynamic disturbances as assessed by Doppler equipment (1/44 vs 6/45 women studied, P= 0.05) and need for treatment in neonatal intensive care unit (10 vs 21, P= 0.04) were more rare in ASA group. ASA tended to increase the birthweight of the newborn (3348 Â± 707 g vs 3170 Â± 665 g, mean Â± SD, P= 0.07), but two perinatal deaths occurred in ASA group. ASA prolonged the bleeding time of the mother (435 s, 210?998 s (geometric mean, range) vs 349 s, 210?690 s, P= 0.02), but caused no extra blood loss during delivery, nor affected neonatal hemostasis. In a subgroup of mothers (ASA, n = 10; placebo, n = 8), ASA inhibited more than 90% of platelet TxA2-production, and caused a 65 to 80% decrease in the urinary excretion of TxA2 metabolites, but no decrease in the urinary excretion of PGI2 metabolites. Conclusions ASA did not prevent the rise of maternal hypertension, but improved fetal haemodynamic performance and reduced the need of intensive neonatal care. It inhibited strongly maternal thromboxane A2 but not PGI2 production and thus shifted the balance between PGI2/TxA2 to the dominance of the vasodilatory, anti-aggregatory side.

AB  - A 12-year-old crossbred dog (case 1) and a 12-year-old Shetland sheepdog (case 2) were presented with a history of lameness and distal limb swelling. Physical examination revealed joint effusions and asymmetrical swellings of the extremities. In case 1, a diagnosis of arthritis and cellulitis was made on fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the synovium and subcutis. In case 2, bone biopsies and synovial aspirates diagnosed osteomyelitis and arthritis. A diagnosis of pancreatic disease was made on the findings of marked elevations of serum lipase concentrations and ultrasonographic identification of pancreatic masses in both cases. Both the cases were non-responsive to symptomatic management and were subsequently euthanased. Postmortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of panniculitis, arthritis and osteomyelitis in both cases. A pancreatic exocrine adenoma was identified in case 1 and a pancreatic adenocarcinoma with widespread metastases in case 2. To the authors' knowledge the association of panniculitis, polyarthritis and osteomyelitis with pancreatic disorders has not been reported previously in canine clinical cases.
