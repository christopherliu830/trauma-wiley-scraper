AB  - Summary Endocrine causes of hypertensive emergencies are easily overlooked when patients present with uncontrolled hypertension in association with evidence of end-organ damage. Emergencies arising from hypertensive crises due to pheochromocytoma can be particularly dangerous. To ensure appropriate therapeutic counter-measures and a favorable outcome, the presence of a catecholamine-producing tumor should be distinguished from more common etiologies as well as other uncommon endocrine causes, such as primary hyperaldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, and thyrotoxicosis. However, diagnosis at the time of the emergency can be made difficult by activation of the sympathoadrenal system resulting from the physiological stress of the clinical condition. Tests of catecholamine excess are therefore rendered problematic to interpret, with reliable diagnosis often only possible once and if the patient recovers. Because of this and time delays in obtaining test results, recognition of a possible endocrine cause in the emergency setting requires careful attention to patient history, presentation, and precipitating causes that may provide clues to underlying etiologies to guide therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Summary The management of dental emergencies in the hospital environment has evolved dramatically over the past few decades. General and pediatric dentists, as well as oral and maxillofacial surgeons are now often the primary providers of care and might manage everything from a simple toothache to the most severe maxillofacial maladies and craniofacial injuries. A thorough knowledge of the organizational, triage, and treatment protocols in the emergency department greatly enhances the dentist's ability to provide rapid, appropriate, and broadly scoped emergency care. This chapter discusses, inter alia, medicolegal aspects of emergency care, intra-oral urgencies, postoperative emergencies, odontogenic infections, salivary gland emergencies, maxillofacial trauma, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) emergencies, in detail.

AB  - Abstract Hypovolemia and hypotension in traumatized patients as well as those undergoing long-lasting surgical procedures lead to hypoperfusion of tissues. Combined with the trauma of flap elevation and the warm ischemia during performance of the anastomoses, hypoperfusion of flap tissues may lead to flap failure. The influence of hypovolemia, ischemia and reperfusion on flap macro- and microcirculation was studied in an acute experiment on a new musculocutaneous pectoralis flap developed in minipigs. Using a multichannel laser Doppler system we studied, simultaneously and continuously, microcirculatory flow (MBF) in both the skin and muscle of the flap as well as in the contralateral control skin and muscle in anesthetized minipigs (n = 7). Measurements were done before and after raising the flap, after 90 min of flap ischemia, during mild to moderate hypovolemia (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% blood loss) and during and after restoration of blood volume. Electromagnetic flowmetry was used to measure total blood flow (TBF) to the flap. All animals remained hemodynamically stable during the experiment. The flap MBF decreased by 20% in the skin and 25% in the muscle after flap elevation with no changes in the control skin and muscle. After flap ischemia and reperfusion, MBF returned to post-elevation values while TBF showed a significant increase as compared to MBF (P<0.05). Hypovolemia caused a gradual drop in cardiac output (25%) and mean arterial pressure (40%), but both recovered above the baseline after reinfusion of shed blood. Hypovolemia also caused a 60% reduction in MBF in both flap skin and muscle, and only 20?23% in control skin and muscle (P<0.01). After reinfusion of shed blood the MBF in the flap remained 30?40% below and the TBF increased 20% over the baseline. The MBF in control skin and muscle increased more than 20% over baseline (P<0.01). It was concluded that MBF in flap skin and muscle decreased by approximately 20?25% as a consequence of flap elevation, while central parameters remained normal. It was shown that even during moderate hypovolemia, MBF in the flap might decrease to critical levels. We suggest that intensive monitoring of central hemodynamics and continuous LDF monitoring of the flap during and after surgery should be performed in order to restore the blood volume expeditiously and prevent irreversible damage to flap tissues. ? 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in pregnancy is most often encountered secondary to underlying obstetrical, surgical, or medical complications. The process of DIC is initiated through the activation of tissue factor (TF), which is found in subendothelial cells, amniotic fluid, and placenta. DIC is seen in severe forms of preeclampsia with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a catastrophic complication in obstetrics and is associated with significant maternal mortality. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) is a rare disease associated with massive obstetric hemorrhage. It is characterized by accumulation of microvesicular fatty infiltration in the maternal hepatocytes, leading to liver failure. The diagnosis of DIC is clinical, based upon underlying etiology, blood loss, and the general condition of the patient. The basic principles of managing obstetrical DIC are multidisciplinary approach, treatment of obstetric causes, blood and blood products, and supportive care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to examine the utility of capsule endoscopy to detect mucosal abnormalities in dogs with gastrointestinal haemorrhage. METHODS Capsules were administered to 2 healthy controls and 8 patients with gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Images were evaluated for quality, gastric emptying time, small intestinal transit time and presence of lesions. RESULTS There were no adverse effects of capsule endoscopy in dogs weighing from 7·7 to 58 kg. The capsule traversed the entire gastrointestinal tract in 5 of 8 patients, with high quality images obtained in the stomach and small intestine. Gastric emptying time and small intestinal transit time ranged from 1 to 270 and 15 to 180 minutes, respectively. In 3 of 8 patients, the capsule remained in the stomach despite pro-kinetics. Gastric lesions included mild haemorrhage and pinpoint erosion (4 of 8), a mass (1) and thickened bleeding pyloric mucosa (2). Two of 3 dogs with capsule retention had gastric lesions. Intestinal lesions included a healing duodenal ulcer, abnormal villi, ileal ulceration and colonic bleeding. Lesions identified by capsule endoscopy were considered a significant source of haemorrhage in 4 of 7 dogs with active bleeding. The relevance of pinpoint gastric mucosal erosions to blood loss is unclear. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Capsule endoscopy can enable the non-invasive detection of gastric and small intestinal mucosal lesions in dogs presenting for evaluation of gastrointestinal bleeding.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare short-term postoperative mortality in dogs after splenectomy performed with or without a bipolar vessel sealing device (BVSD) and to identify variables associated with mortality. Study design Retrospective study. Sample population Client-owned dogs (n = 203). Methods Medical records of dogs that underwent splenectomy from 2005-2018 were reviewed. Mortality rates were compared between dogs that underwent splenectomy with or without BVSD. Causes of death and variables associated with short-term mortality were assessed. Results Fifteen of 203 (7.4%) dogs died prior to discharge, and seven (3.4%) dogs died prior to suture removal for a total short-term mortality rate of 22 of 203 (10.8%). The estimated difference in proportion of deaths prior to discharge between the BVSD and non-BVSD groups was ?0.01 (95% confidence interval = ?0.08 to 0.06). Duration of anesthesia was longer when splenectomy was performed without BVSD (median 168 vs 152?minutes; P = .03). Multivariate analysis identified intraoperative (odds ratio [OR] 5.7) or postoperative (OR 13.6) administration of blood products, increasing duration of anesthesia (OR 1.15 per additional 16?minutes), and intraoperative ventricular arrhythmias (OR 6.8) as significantly associated with death prior to discharge. Intraoperative (OR 3.2) or postoperative (OR 7.7) administration of blood products was associated with death prior to suture removal. Conclusion Use of a BVSD did not appear to increase short-term mortality after splenectomy. Clinical significance Dogs undergoing splenectomy that require intraoperative or postoperative transfusions, experience intraoperative ventricular arrhythmias, or have prolonged anesthesia may be at risk for death in the short-term postoperative period.

AB  - Scabies was recently reported for the first time in the European wild rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus (Lagomorpha: Leporidae). We experimentally exposed 10 seronegative wild-caught rabbits to skin from a mangy wild rabbit. Serological, physiological, parasitological and histopathological changes were recorded. Three rabbits developed antibodies at 2?5 weeks post-infection (w.p.i.), two of which then developed lesions at 7 w.p.i. One of these had a small area of alopecia on the hind limb that healed naturally within 1 week; the other developed more extensive lesions restricted to the hind limbs (as typically observed in wild rabbits) that lasted until the rabbit died (12.5 w.p.i.). The third rabbit died of trauma 5 w.p.i. before developing any lesions. Antibodies in the healed rabbit disappeared from serum at 8 w.p.i., whereas antibody levels in the sick rabbit increased until its death. Disseminated intravascular coagulation and hepatic necrosis, probably arising from a concomitant infection with rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus, were the likely final cause of death in this rabbit. The mangy rabbit that served as a donor died of a multifocal fibrinosuppurative pneumonia that may have been secondary to the skin bacterial pyoderma.

AB  - Abstract We analyze key proteomic issues and cutting-edge technologies that will spearhead inroads into functional interpretations of human diseases and their therapeutic rectification, following the availability of the predicted human proteome. We contrast the distinctions between high quality data that are low throughput, (e.g., 3-D proteomic reconstructions in embryogenic and nervous system contexts, and multigenerational transgenic studies), versus automated data harvesting that is more distant from human disease phenotypes and currently fulfills a diagnostic role, (e.g., molecular portraits of human diseases via transcriptomic analyses). We examine the extent to which these approaches impinge upon a realistic understanding of human diseases, namely how close they come to revealing the causal events involved in the initiation of disease. While tissue sources from human embryogenesis, foetal development and the brain remain the absolute priority, the pragmatic approaches utilize judicious data integration from selected proteomic studies of model organisms. The role of genome-wide disease-related screens, ?humanized? transgenic analyses, multigenerational gene interference methods, and analyses of post-translational modifications in epigenetic contexts from Drosophila will be crucial, since these avenues are far too slow and transgenically cumbersome in mammals. Finally, the implementation of multi compartment electrolyzers (MCE) and multi photon detection (MPD) systems will be pivotal for the proteomic profiling of human tissue samples.

The disorders include Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), traumatic brain injury, and epilepsy. For each disorder/disease, first a detailed background is given before focusing on medical and dental management and treatment. Under medical management section, a set of key questions that have to be asked to the physician and a set of questions that need to be asked to the patient, are listed. Under dental management, risks of dental care, susceptibility to infection, drug actions/interactions, and the patient's ability to tolerate dental care, are described.

AB  - Sepsis, shock, multiple trauma, and burns are often associated with altered metabolism characterized by severe catabolism, wasting of the lean body mass, immune dysfunction, and compromised wound healing. Nutrition support is one of the mainstays in the management of these critically ill patients and is aimed at minimizing these complications. The purpose of this article is to compare stress hypermetabolism and starvation metabolism, to review current recommendations for the provision of energy and substrate to the critically ill patient, and to review pertinent literature regarding enteral vs parenteral nutrition. Finally, this article will provide a brief overview of new and future therapies with emphasis on specific substrates and growth factors and the potential for their use in the critically ill patient.
