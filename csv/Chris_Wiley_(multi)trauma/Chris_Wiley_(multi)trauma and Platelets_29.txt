AB  - Objectives: Immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) is a severe disease for which evidence is lacking to make informed choices regarding immunosuppressive regimen. The aims of the current study were to determine the effect of different treatment regimens on outcome in affected animals and to identify parameters that may be used as prognostic factors for the disease. Methods: The records of dogs presenting to a veterinary hospital in the period 2002 to 2010 for treatment of IMHA were examined and follow-up data were obtained. Statistical tests were performed to establish whether treatment regimen affected outcome and to identify prognostic factors for outcome. Results: Treatment regimen had a significant effect on the outcome (measured as survival of hospitalisation) but there were insufficient subjects to determine the cause of the difference. Serum bilirubin and urea concentrations were found to be significant negative prognostic factors for the outcome of IMHA cases and the concentrations of these parameters were significantly different between animals that survived or died while hospitalised. Clinical Significance: This study presents the first report of a significant difference in outcome comparing animals treated with immunosuppressive drugs which are in widespread clinical usage. Although possible confounding factors should be considered, these findings could have major consequences for the treatment of IMHA.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Comparative surgical audit is increasingly important, although fraught due to the difficulty of risk adjusted analysis. The surgical risk score was developed to provide surgeon-independent risk-adjusted mortality in general surgery using readily available clinical indices (CEPOD grade of operative urgency, BUPA grade of operative magnitude and ASA grade of patient comorbidities). Methods: Prospective data collection from 4308 patients admitted under the care of three general surgeons (May 1997?October 1999) created an initial data set of 3144 procedures with 134 deaths. Each procedure was scored by summation of linear scales allocated to CEPOD, BUPA and ASA grades to devise a surgical risk scale (SRS) ranging from 3 to 14. Multi-variate logistic regression analysis involving the three variables and uni-variate analysis of the SRS scores were undertaken. Receiver operating characteristic and calibration curves were formulated. This process was validated on another data set (2780 patients) derived from all admissions to the same surgeons (November 1999?December 2000). Results: Uni-variate logistic analysis of the SRS score revealed it to be significantly predictive of death (? = 0.84, P < 0.001). The SRS score did not over predict mortality for low risk procedures. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.931 for the initial data set and 0.951 for the validation set. Conclusion: The SRS is easy to use, formulate and interpret. It has been validated as a tool for risk-adjusted comparative audit in a population of general surgical patients.

AB  - Sepsis, shock, multiple trauma, and burns are often associated with altered metabolism characterized by severe catabolism, wasting of the lean body mass, immune dysfunction, and compromised wound healing. Nutrition support is one of the mainstays in the management of these critically ill patients and is aimed at minimizing these complications. The purpose of this article is to compare stress hypermetabolism and starvation metabolism, to review current recommendations for the provision of energy and substrate to the critically ill patient, and to review pertinent literature regarding enteral vs parenteral nutrition. Finally, this article will provide a brief overview of new and future therapies with emphasis on specific substrates and growth factors and the potential for their use in the critically ill patient.

AB  - Case Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) caused by Clostridium butyricum is common in neonates; however, a case of NEC in adults has not been previously reported. An 84-year-old Japanese man developed C. butyricum-related NEC during hospitalization for treatment of stab wounds to the left side of the neck and lower abdomen, without organ damage, and concomitant pneumonia. Outcome The patient developed acute onset of emesis accompanied by shock during his admission; partial resection of the small intestine was carried out due to necrosis. Pathologic findings showed mucosal necrosis and extensive vacuolation with gram-positive rods in the necrotic small intestine. Blood culture tests revealed C. butyricum infection. The patient's condition improved after the surgery. He was moved to a rehabilitation hospital on day 66. Conclusion This study suggests that hospitalized adult patients who receive antibiotic treatment are at risk for NEC.

AB  - Abstract. Objectives: Resuscitation studies of hypertonic saline using controlled and uncontrolled hemorrhage models yield conflicting results with regard to efficacy. These disparate results reflect the use of models and resuscitation regimens that are not comparable between studies. This study evaluated the effects of comparable and clinically relevant resuscitation regimens of 7.5% sodium chloride/6% dextran 70 (HSD) and 0.9% sodium chloride (NS) in a near-fatal uncontrolled hemorrhage model. Methods: Thirty-six swine (14.2 to 21.4 kg) with 4-mm aortic tears were bled to a pulse pressure of 5 mm Hg (40-45 mL/kg). The animals were resuscitated with either NS or HSD administered in volumes that provided equivalent sodium loads at similar rates. Group II (n = 12) was resuscitated with 80 mL/kg of NS at a rate of 4 mL/kg/min. Group III (n = 12) received 9.6 mL/kg of HSD at a rate of 0.48 mL/kg/min. In both groups, crystalloid resuscitation was followed by shed blood infusion (30 mL/kg) at a rate of 2 mL/kg/min. Group I (controls; n = 12) were not resuscitated. Results: One-hour mortality was significantly greater in group I (92%) as compared with group II (33%) and group III (33%) (Fisher's exact test; p = 0.004). Intraperitoneal hemorrhage was significantly greater in group II (34 ± 20 mL/kg) and group III (31 ± 13 mL/kg) as compared with group I (5 ± 2 mL/kg) (ANOVA; p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in hemodynamic parameters between groups II and III. Conclusion: In this model of severe uncontrolled hemorrhage, resuscitation with HSD or NS, administered in volumes that provided equivalent sodium loads at similar rates, had similar effects on mortality, hemodynamic parameters, and hemorrhage from the injury site.

AB  - Introduction:? Sickle cell ulcers are a frequent dermatologic manifestation of sickle cell disease. They are almost exclusively described in the legs near the malleoli and are often bilateral. Such ulcers in the upper extremities are not described. We report a case of sickle cell ulcer in hand presumably related to arterio-venous fistula in the forearm placed for hemodialysis in a patient with chronic kidney disease. Case:? A 45-year-old African-American man with a history of sickle cell disease, hypertension, and kidney failure treated with hemodialysis presented with a painful wound in his left hand near the base of his thumb, which had been present for 6 weeks prior to presentation. There was no history of trauma. 6 months prior to the development of the ulcer, the patient had an arterio-venous fistula placed in the affected hand. The ulcer did not improve with use of antibiotics. Venous ultrasound of the left upper extremity showed occlusion of the cephalic vein and enlargement of the basilic vein. Subsequently, biopsy of the ulcer showed vascular proliferation with thickening of the vessel and obliteration of the vascular lumen. The blood vessels were plugged with sickled red blood cells, characteristic of sickle cell disease. Histological features of the lesion were indicative of vaso-occlusive disease, suggesting sickle cell ulcer. Patient was treated with surgical débridement and skin grafting after hyperbaric oxygen therapy that only resulted in partial recovery of the lesion. Discussion:? The pathogenesis of sickle cell ulcer is presumed to be related to a vaso-occlusive process, leading to tissue necrosis resulting in skin ulcers. Ulcers can occur spontaneously or with local trauma. Low oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, impaired venous hemodynamics, and low hemoglobin are recognized contributing factors. The arterio-venous fistula causing diversion of arterial blood probably contributed to the development of sickle cell ulcer. Conclusion:? Sickle cell ulcers in the hand, although extremely rare, can occur in sickle cell patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis with arterio-venous fistula. This results from the altered local vascular hemodynamics that predispose to vaso-occlusive conditions, eventually leading to ulceration.

AB  - The combined radiation-wound injury is a refractory wound with decreased number or dysfunction of repairing cells and growth factors. This remains a challenge in clinical practice. The object of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a combination of human vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (hVEGF165) and human beta-defensin 3 (hBD3) in the treatment of such wounds. A plasmid-carrying hVEGF165 gene and hBD3 gene was used to transfect rat bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). The supernatant from the modified BMSCs significantly promoted the proliferation and cell migration of human endothelial cells and it also inhibited the growth of bacteria and fungus, demonstrating the successful expression of the transfected genes. The hVEGF165/hBD3-modified BMSCs were then injected into the sites of combined radiation-wound injury on rats. It demonstrated that wound-healing time was shortened significantly in the treated rats. The granulation tissue formation/maturation, skin appendage regeneration and collagen deposition were also improved significantly. Strong expression of hVEGF165 and hBD3 was detected in the wound surface at early stage of the healing. The results indicate that topical transplantation of hVEGF165/hBD3-modified BMSCs promoted wound healing, and this gene therapy strategy presents a promising approach in the treatment of refractory wounds such as the combined radiation-wound injury.

AB  - Background and purpose Critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy (CIP/CIM) is being increasingly recognized as a significant clinical problem in critically ill children especially if they have spent long periods in the intensive care unit. So the aim was to determine the frequency of CIP/CIM amongst mechanically ventilated children and to analyse the associated risk factors and drawbacks frequently encountered in this cohort. Methods The study included 105 patients admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit who underwent mechanical ventilation for ≥7 days. These patients were screened daily for awakening. Patients with severe muscle weakness on day 7 post-awakening underwent nerve conduction studies and electromyography. Accordingly, the patients were classified as CIP/CIM patients if they had abnormal neurophysiology studies or control patients if normal neurophysiology studies were obtained. Their clinical and laboratory profiles had been recorded as well. Results Overall, of 105 patients who achieved satisfactory awakening, 34 patients (32.4%) developed CIP/CIM mostly of the axonal polyneuropathy pattern (27.6%) whilst 71 control patients (67.6%) showed normal electrophysiological studies. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly longer in patients with CIP/CIM compared to control patients (P = 0.001). The study also revealed that 62.1% of our CIP/CIM patients failed weaning trials and finally died. CIP/CIM was significantly associated with decreased platelets, elevated liver enzymes and prolonged prothrombin time. Acidosis, low serum calcium and albumin levels and higher blood glucose were also found to be more significant in CIP/CIM patients compared to control patients. Conclusion Critically ill children frequently develop CIP/CIM, mostly of axonal polyneuropathy pattern, which compromises rehabilitation and recovery and is associated with a number of comorbidities.

AB  - Objectives To compare serum concentrations of homocysteine in healthy dogs and those fitting the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome and to compare these values to commonly measured B-vitamins. Methods Study dogs were classified into non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome or sepsis groups and blood was drawn on Day 1 of the patient's hospitalisation for measurement of serum homocysteine, folate and cobalamin concentrations. Homocysteine concentration was measured in 51 clinically healthy dogs to serve as the control group. Results A statistically significant difference was found between the homocysteine concentrations of the healthy group when compared to non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome and sepsis groups. Homocysteine values were not correlated with folate, cobalamin or APPLEfast severity scores. Homocysteine concentrations were significantly lower in sick dogs when compared to the control group, which is dissimilar to the human population. Clinical Significance The clinical significance of homocysteine changes in critically ill dogs is currently unknown.

AB  - Heparins are a heterogenous group of naturally occurring glycosaminoglycans characterized by anticoagulant activity and a wide range of molecular weights (low molecular weight or fractionated heparins evolving within the past two decades). Cofactors for endogenous inhibitors of coagulation (antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II), heparin administration results in a hypocoagulable state. Various platelet activities, including inhibition of activity induced by platelet-derived growth factors on vascular smooth muscle, also have been noted. Divorced of anticoagulant nature, novel applications may include a role in atherosclerosis prevention, acceleration of collateral coronary as well as peripheral circulation (i.e., angiogenesis), and continued (chronic) post-myocardial infarction therapy. Established indications include treatment of various thrombotic diseases, unstable angina, and thrombosis chemoprophylaxis in medical/surgical patients. The antithrombotic potential of the heparins is used also in thrombosis management related to extracorporeal circulatory assistance or dialysis devices. Heparin's therapeutic potential in the postphlebitic syndrome as well as in acute treatment of myocardial infarction (primarily and adjunctively with various thrombolytic agents) continues to undergo evaluation; however, early data review shows favorable trends for its inclusion in situations that favor thrombus generation (e.g., anterior myocardial infarction). Although associated with thrombocytopenia or hypertransaminasemia, the heparins are relatively well tolerated. In a small subset of patients, a severe thrombocytopenia may ensue, which generally resolves on medication withdrawal. As this class of glycosaminoglycans becomes better characterized, new indications may emerge for both native and the newer fractionated heparins.

AB  - The administration of MPSS is advocated both for limiting spinal cord injury from Hansen Type I intervertebral disk protrusion (T1-IVD) and from the potential surgical trauma associated with laminectomy. Recent studies suggest that treatment with MPSS does not significantly alter functional outcome and is associated with significant complications including gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic necrosis, and increased rates of infection. The purpose of this prospective study was to report the results of laminectomy without MPSS treatment in non-ambulatory dogs with T1-IVD. The study group involved dogs weighing less than 15?kg that had a laminectomy between T11-T12 and L4-L5 for T1-IVD. Dogs included had not been treated with MPSS, were unable to walk but able to sense ?deep pain?. The dogs were evaluated post-operatively for the ability to walk (stand and advance pelvic limbs), pain (reaction to paraspinal palpation or movement), and incontinence (dribbling urine/feces or failure to completely void urine). Fifty-one dogs met the inclusion criteria. Prior to surgery 0% of the dogs could walk (26 paralyzed, 25 paretic), and 98% were painful. Incontinence was not assessed or was unknown in most cases. Ten days following surgery, 90% were walking, 98% were pain-free, and 82% were fully continent. By 6 weeks, 100% were walking, 6% were painful, and 86% fully continent. By 16 weeks, 96% were pain-free, and 88% were fully continent. These results obtained with laminectomy alone are comparable or superior to reports of those with MPSS administration and suggest that MPSS is not necessary for a successful outcome in dogs receiving laminectomy for T1-IVD.

AB  - Abstract Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by severe congenital or immune-mediated deficiency in ADAMTS13, the enzyme that cleaves von Willebrand factor multimers. This rare condition leads invariably and rapidly to a fatal outcome in the absence of treatment, and therefore raises multiple diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The novel concepts and mechanisms identified in the laboratory for this disease have been rapidly and successfully translated into the clinic for the benefit of patients, making TTP an archetypal disease that has benefited from targeted therapies. After decades of empirical treatment with plasma exchange, identification of ADAMTS13 as the key enzyme involved in TTP pathophysiology provided an explanation for the remarkable efficacy of plasma administration, in which the missing enzyme is replenished, and paved the way for development of a recombinant form of the enzyme. Similarly, the demonstration of a major role of anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies through models of passive transfer of autoimmunity spurred development of immunomodulatory strategies based on B-cell depletion. More recently, an inhibitor of the platelet-von Willebrand factor interaction demonstrated efficacy in large clinical trials through prevention of formation of further microthrombi and protection of organs from ischemia. These translational breakthroughs in TTP are described in our review.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the sepsis and the inflammatory response to injury. Higher doses of corticosteroids have been shown to be harmful in severe sepsis. Early administration of antibiotics has been shown to have a significant impact on outcomes with sepsis. The coagulation system plays an important role in the sepsis-induced inflammatory cascade. Coagulation is activated by the inflammatory reaction to tissue injury and is activated independent of the type of microbe (e.g., gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites). Coagulation induced by inflammation can in turn contribute to further inflammation. Depletion of anticoagulant and fibrinolytic factors contributes to the microvascular deposition of fibrin that is associated with organ dysfunction. Coagulation abnormalities in sepsis contribute significantly to organ dysfunction and death.

AB  - Abstract There is strong evidence that patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) are at increased risk of developing coronary heart disease. This elevated risk is independent of classical risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes and hypertension. The risk of coronary heart disease, put simply, is proportional to the severity of the depression. Also conclusively demonstrated is the adverse effect of depression in patients following myocardial infarction, which materially increases mortality. The mechanism of increased cardiac risk attributable to MDD is at present uncertain, but activation of the sympathetic nervous system, altered baroreflex sensitivity, and/or exaggerated platelet reactivity and endothelial dysfunction are likely to be of prime importance.
