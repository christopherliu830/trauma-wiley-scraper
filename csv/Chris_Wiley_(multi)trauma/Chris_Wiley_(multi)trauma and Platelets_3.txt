AB  - Abstract In recent years, autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) derivatives have been used widely in the regeneration and repair of tissue, but a standard definition and preparation method for PRP are lacking. We developed a standardized method using platelet indices as quality-control indicators for PRP preparation. Twenty-one elderly patients (9 males, 12 females) with complex wounds were treated with standardized platelet-rich plasma (S-PRP). The platelet count in PRP after the second centrifugation was 1,069?1,436???109/L. We adjusted the platelet concentration in PRP after a second centrifugation to 1,000???109/L according to a formula using platelet-poor plasma (PPP). The standardized preparation method that we developed gave S-PRP with a relatively uniform platelet concentration. The wounds of 21 patients showed accelerated healing after S-PRP treatment, and there were no obvious side effects during treatment. These data suggest that our preparation method of S-PRP, using platelet indices as quality-control indicators with platelet count of 1,000???109/L could be used for the treatment of complex wounds in the elderly. The preparation method of S-PRP proposed in the present study may be a simple and effective method of PRP quality control.

AB  - Summary Adhesion molecules appear to play a pivotal role in tissue damage secondary to the inflammatory process. Besides neutrophiland endothelial-bound adhesion molecules, soluble forms have been detected in the circulating blood. They seem to be good markers of endothelial damage, but they may also have other biological functions. Plasma concentrations of soluble adhesion molecules (endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecules (sELAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), and granule membrane protein 140 (sGMP-140) were serially measured over 5 days by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in 45 consecutive trauma patients. These received, by random allocation, only either hydroxyethylstarch solution 10% (mean molecular weight 200 000 daltons) (n = 15) or human albumin 20% (n = 15) for volume therapy. Another 15 patients without defined volume therapy received pentoxifylline continuously (1.2mg.kg-1.h-1). Measurements were carried out on the day of admission to the intensive care unit (baseline) and during the next 5 days. At baseline, plasma concentrations of all adhesion molecules were similar in all groups. In the hydroxyethyl starch group, sELAM-1 and sICAM-1 concentrations decreased significantly (p < 0.05) reaching normal values during the study period whereas the mean (SD) values increased in the pentoxifylline group (sELAM-1: 71.1 (16.7) to 91.6 (17.8) ng.ml-1) and the albumin group (sICAM-1: 400 (81) to 749 (101) ng.ml-1) (p < 0.05). sVCAM-1 increased outside the normal range only in the human albumin group (to 760 ± 69 ng.ml-1) (p < 0.05). sGMP-140 plasma concentration increased only in those receiving albumin (432 (85) to 550 (93) ng.ml-1) and this was significantly different to the other groups (p < 0.05). None of the other haemodynamic or laboratory factors could be correlated with plasma concentrations of the adhesion molecules. We conclude that colume therapy with hydroxyethyl starch resulted in a decrease in circulating adhesion molecules in our trauma patients. In contrast, volume therapy with albumin did not exert this effect. Continuous infusion of pentoxifylline did not have a beneficial modulating action on circulating adhesion molecules.

AB  - Abstract A severe microarterial trauma (arteriotomy/intimectomy) was introduced to the central arteries of rabbit ears. Twenty-one patent vessels, 3 at each interval of 2 hours, 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, and 90 days after reperfusion were taken for light and scanning electron microscopy studies. These vessels remained patent at all time intervals. A physiological ?in vivo? perfusion technique with fixation fluid of normal temperature (37°C), pressure (120 mm Hg) and osmolarity (300 mOsm) was used to ensure fixed relaxed vessels. The endothelial, internal elastic, and part of the medial layers of vessel walls were removed following intimectomy. The inner surface of the intimectomy region was irregular and partly covered with thrombotic materials between 2 hours and 3 days postreperfusion. Endothelialization of the traumatized region was first observed at 3 days and was completed between 7 and 14 days. Intimal hyperplasia developed during this period and had not diminished in thickness by 30 or 90 days. The trauma and healing process of the arteriotomy/intimectomy are similar to the healing of vascular anastomoses and virtually identical to the clinical trauma of vessel avulsion, but neointima formation is more pronounced and engages vessel walls far outside the intimectomy site. ? 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary.? Platelets play a pivotal role in the arrest of bleeding at sites of vascular injury. Following endothelial damage, they respond rapidly by adhesion to subendothelial matrix proteins resulting in platelet activation, spreading, aggregation, secretion and recruitment of additional platelets to form the primary haemostatic plug. This mass provides a surface for thrombin generation and fibrin mesh formation that stabilizes the clot. Careful study of patients with inherited platelet disorders and, subsequently, of informative animal models, has identified structural platelet abnormalities that have enhanced our understanding of platelet function. The investigations of rare, but severe, inherited platelet disorders have led us to the discovery of causative molecular defects. One of the most informative is the rare autosomal recessive disorder Glanzmann thrombasthenia, caused by defect or deficiency in the platelet integrin αIIb?3, resulting in absent platelet aggregation and a significant clinical bleeding diathesis. Our new challenge is to understand the mechanisms underlying more common, but less well-defined, mucocutaneous bleeding (MCB) disorders. Present diagnostic testing for platelet function disorders and von Willebrand?s Disease often fails to identify the cause of bleeding in individuals with inherited MCB.

This case report describes a gelding that presented for weight loss, increased respiratory rate and effort and chronic intermittent epistaxis. During post mortem examination diffuse eosinophilic granulomatous lesions were identified in the lung and liver, leading to a diagnosis of MEED. Veno-occlusive pulmonary remodelling was also discovered, believed to be the cause of the chronic epistaxis and a result of the pulmonary fibrosis and eosinophilic granulomas.

AB  - Abstract This study examines the incidence and significance of novel plasma derived platelet aggregating activity (PAA) in 190 consecutive patients admitted to the medical wards of a general hospital. Seventy five patients (39%) demonstrated this activity. The incidence was highest in patients with a history of thrombosis (52%) or in those with a heightened thrombotic tendency, for example, patients with diabetes or hypertension. In contrast, platelet aggregating activity was observed in six out of 62 patients (approximately 10%) in whom a current or past medical history of thrombosis could not be elicited and in only two out of 72 healthy volunteers examined (3%). A high frequency of PAA was also noted in a small group of patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenia and patients who had previously received, platelet transfusions. In these patients, this activity presumably reflects the presence of antiplatelet antibodies. A good correlation between the presence of plasma derived platelet aggregating activity and the phenomenon of spontaneous platelet aggregation was observed. The platelet aggregating activity was not heparin dependent, but was completely abolished by EDTA (5 mM) and benzamidine (8 mM), or by pretreating the platelets with aspirin. A synergistic response was observed with subaggregatory concentrations of thrombin and adrenalin. Our results suggest that the presence of this platelet aggregating activity may provide a marker for vascular thrombosis. Furthermore we postulate that this plasma derived activity may be partly responsible for platelet hyperactivity previously observed in patients with thromboembolic disorders.

AB  - Abstract: Liver transplantation (LTx) in children currently offers long-term survival rates of more than 80%. Many causes for Tx failure have been identified. However, the incidence and impact of multi-organ system failure (MOSF) are, to date, unknown. Therefore, in this study the role of MOSF after LTx in children was investigated with regard to outcome. The data of 114 children (53 girls, 61 boys; median age 4.3?yr) after first LTx were evaluated retrospectively. The definition of MOSF, as used by Wilkinson et al. [Crit Care Med 1986: 14: 271?274], was modified with regard to age-adjusted values. The influence of MOSF on patient survival was investigated by Kaplan?Meier analysis and multivariate regression analysis. Thirty-one of 114 children with orthotopic LTx developed MOSF (involving two or more organs). In total, 18 children died (15.8%) during the hospitalization; 16 of these had MOSF. Mortality related to two-organ failure was 29.4% (n?=?5), to three-organ failure 78% (n?=?7), and to four-organ failure 80% (n?=?4). The highest mortality rates were observed in children with central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular failure, leading to a decreased probability of survival of 0.40 (p <?0.0001). Multi-variate analysis showed that CNS and cardiovascular failure were the most important risk factors for survival (p <?0.0001 and 0.056, respectively). Respiratory and renal failure, in univariate analysis, were significant contributors to poor survival, but had no statistically significant influence on outcome in multivariate analysis. Bone marrow insufficiency was found to have no influence on survival in either analysis. In multivariate analysis, the risk of development of MOSF was significantly increased by high numbers of transfused units of fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), the absence of rejection episodes, or a high bilirubin level prior to Tx. Hence, MOSF is a major factor contributing to the death of children early after LTx. CNS and cardiovascular failure carried the highest risk for a poor outcome. Other risk factors associated with the development of MOSF were: numbers of transfused units of FFP, absence of rejection episodes, and a high pre-Tx bilirubin level.

AB  - Summary Background Patients undergoing major cardiothoracic surgery are subjected to dilution, owing to massive fluid infusion and blood component transfusion. These patients may experience bleeding perioperatively, and are frequently treated with the endothelium-activating agent desmopressin. Objectives To investigate the effect of desmopressin administration on von Willebrand factor (VWF)-dependent coagulant and platelet functions under flow conditions. Patients/methods Blood from 16 patients with postoperative bleeding was obtained before and after desmopressin treatment (0.3 ?g kg?1 body weight), and assessed for coagulant properties and platelet function. Furthermore, VWF antigen levels and multimer composition were determined in both samples. Results Desmopressin treatment did not change thrombin generation in plasma or whole blood thromboelasticity. Also coagulation factor levels (other than factor VIII) and coagulation times were unchanged, suggesting that desmopressin treatment did not have a major effect on the coagulant activity. On the other hand, desmopressin treatment raised the already high plasma levels of VWF from a median of 116 IU mL?1 (interquartile range [IQR] 102?154 IU mL?1) to a median of 160 IU mL?1 (IQR 126?187 IU mL?1) (P = 0.007), owing to accumulation of the high molecular weight VWF multimers. Furthermore, desmopressin treatment caused an increase in collagen-dependent thrombus formation and platelet phosphatidylserine exposure. Markers of thrombus formation correlated with the plasma levels of VWF. In vitro control experiments confirmed a major contribution of VWF to thrombus formation and procoagulant activity under conditions of blood dilution. Conclusions Desmopressin treatment of patients with bleeding complications after cardiothoracic surgery induces the release of high molecular weight VWF multimers, which enhance platelet activation and thrombus formation under flow conditions.

It affects the entire process of care, both for the clinicians involved in the patient's care and for the blood bank, given the consequences and complications of transfusions. This article will highlight the pathophysiology leading to the need for massive transfusion and provide some modern surgical approaches to decrease the transfusion requirement and lessen its effect on the individual patient. Practical suggestions for a massive transfusion protocol, based on our experience and the available literature will be provided. Finally the article will examine the complications of a massive transfusion and outline the steps in the prevention and management of these complications.

Platelet function in particular is of interest in cardiac surgery as cardiopulmonary bypass itself creates known platelet dysfunction, but also because more and more patients are on antiplatelet agents due to coronary stenting procedures. This review will focus on presenting current data relating to platelet function in the perioperative setting, along with a brief review of general coagulation concepts.

AB  - Summary Fulminant hyperfibrinolysis has a mortality rate of 80-100% and requires early treatment with anti-fibrinolytics and fibrinogen. In cases of major trauma, rapid coagulation assessment and control are fundamental to successful patient management. Standard laboratory coagulation tests take time and are insufficient in describing Trauma-Induced Coagulopathy. Point-Of-Care (POC) tests such as ROTEM? (rotational thromboelastometry) and MULTIPLATE? (impedance aggregometry) can overcome these limitations and are effective as a guide to coagulation status and requirements for transfusion support. We report the successful POC management of fulminant hyperfibrinolysis after a hanging trauma in a man admitted to the Emergency Department.

AB  - Abstract The effect of the fibrinolysis inhibitor tranexamic acid on early thrombus formation following microvascular trauma was investigated in the central arteries of ears in 86 rabbits (in all 172 vessels), divided into four separate blind randomised studies. In the first part a common end-to-end anastomosis was done and in the last three studies a severe trauma-arteriotomy/intimectomy was performed. Parameters studied were vessel bleeding times, patency rates, weights of intraluminal thrombotic material, haematocrit and plasma fibrinolytic activity. In the first study consisting of 14 control animals and 18 animals treated with 14 mg/kg bw of tranexamic acid, end-to-end anastomosis was performed on the central artery of one ear and on the central vein of the other ear. In the second, third, and fourth studies consisting of 18, 20, and 16 control vessels and the same number of corresponding vessels in treated animals a 7-mm longitudinal arteriotomy followed by a deep 5-mm-long intimectomy was performed. The second and third treated groups were given 14 mg/kg bw of tranexamic acid 5 min and 1 h, respectively, before reflow and the fourth group 28 mg/kg bw 5 min before reflow. The difference between the second and third studies was the addition, to mimic clinical situations, of 8.5 ml saline/kg bw 2 h before reflow in the third study. In conclusion, treatment with a single clinical dose, 14 mg/kg of tranexamic acid, did not influence vessel bleeding times or thrombus formation in the anastomotic or severe trauma models and seems safe to use. Not even a double clinical dose, 28 mg/kg, influenced thrombus formation in a statistically significant way. ? 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc. MICROSURGERY 17:278?285 1996

AB  - Purpose? The incidence of abdominal stab wounds treated at the Royal Melbourne Hospital has noticeably increased over the 12 month period to March 2006, mirroring an increase in penetrating abdominal trauma throughout many Australian trauma centers. Management protocols for abdominal stab wounds are still contentious. The current study quantifies the increase in stab wounds at the Royal Melbourne Hospital over a 24 month period and analyzes the management and investigative modalities utilized. Methodology? A review of the Trauma Unit of the Royal Melbourne Hospital was performed for the period of March 20th 2004 until March 20th 2006. All anterior abdominal stab wounds were collated for the site of injury, investigations performed on admission, results of investigations, operations performed, and findings at operation. Results? There were 4244 emergency trauma presentations over the 24 months period between March 20th 2004 and March 20th 2006. The second 12 month period showed a 21.5% increase in overall trauma admissions and a 91.3% increase in anterior abdominal stabbings. The percentage of stab wounds treated conservatively fell by 21.8%, with the percentage of laparotomies increasing by 14.2%. Almost 30% of all patients undergoing surgery had no visceral injury at operation. Twenty CT scans were performed preoperatively, with a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 100%. Conclusion? Abdominal stab wounds treated at Royal Melbourne Hospital have substantially increased over the past 12 months. Whilst management is still contentious, a management protocol for anterior abdominal stab wounds is proposed, outlining the role of CT scanning, conservative management, laparoscopy and laparotomy

AB  - Summary Platelet transfusions can be essential to the management of dogs with severe thrombocytopenia or thrombopathia experiencing uncontrolled or life-threatening bleeding. While human blood banks maintain platelet concentrate (PC) in their inventories, fresh whole blood (FWB) is the only readily available platelet-containing product in many veterinary practices. Although there are few clinical indications for FWB, it might be appropriate in the management of dogs and cats with anemia and bleeding due to thrombocytopenia or thrombopathia or in those requiring massive transfusion. An alternative approach to preparation of PC from FWB is plateletpheresis. Fresh platelet products have a short shelf life. During the past several decades, platelet cryopreservation has been extensively investigated as a means to provide long-term storage and immediate availability of platelet products for transfusion. Due to the time limitation on storage of fresh PC and the cumbersome process of platelet cryopreservation, there has been considerable interest in the development of lyophilized platelet products.

AB  - Although uncommon, and despite the modern in diagnostic tools and therapeutic alternatives, retrohepatic and main hepatic veins injury remains associated with high mortality rate. Preoperative diagnosis is uncommon, and bullet trajectory may be a helpful sign in penetrating trauma patients. Patients and Methods? Hospital records of patients sustaining retroheptic vena cava (RHVC) injury were retrospectively reviewed as to diagnosis, associated injuries, injury characteristics, surgical management, and outcome, last ten years. Results? Eight male, 17 to 45 (mean 27.5) years-old patients sustaining RHVC injury were reviewed. Mean trauma indexes for the 8 cases were: ISS 36.6, RTS 7.55 and TRISS 89.0; and for the group who died: ISS 41.6, RTS 7.18, and TRISS 80.5. Two patients had sustained blunt trauma (one died), and six had penetrating injuries (two died). The injury diagnosis was achieved during surgery in all cases. A transfixing RHV injury occurred in 4 (50% of the) patients, and was found in all the 3 patients who died. An atriocaval shunt was employed in four patients, 3 of them had with transfixing injury with two deaths. The number of associated injuries was higher in the patients who died. Overall mortality rate was 37.5%. Comments? Despite advances in image diagnosis, injuries to RHVC are frequently diagnosed during surgery. Tangential injuries were managed with direct approach and sutures, and to control blending in transfixing injuries, were managed with atriocaval shunts, before suture. Conclusion? Despite improvements in its diagnosis and management, RHVC injuries remain with a high mortality rate, mainly when transfixing, and associated with numerous associated injuries.

AB  - Summary Inherited disorders of platelet granules are clinically heterogeneous and their prevalence is underestimated because most patients do not undergo a complete diagnostic work-up. The lack of a genetic diagnosis limits the ability to tailor management, screen family members, aid with family planning, predict clinical progression and detect serious consequences, such as myelofibrosis, lung fibrosis and malignancy, in a timely manner. This is set to change with the introduction of high throughput sequencing (HTS) as a routine clinical diagnostic test. HTS diagnostic tests are now available, affordable and allow parallel screening of DNA samples for variants in all of the 80 known bleeding, thrombotic and platelet genes. Increased genetic diagnosis and curation of variants is, in turn, improving our understanding of the pathobiology and clinical course of inherited platelet disorders. Our understanding of the genetic causes of platelet granule disorders and the regulation of granule biogenesis is a work in progress and has been significantly enhanced by recent genomic discoveries from high-powered genome-wide association studies and genome sequencing projects. In the era of whole genome and epigenome sequencing, new strategies are required to integrate multiple sources of big data in the search for elusive, novel genes underlying granule disorders.

AB  - Several hemostatic strategies rely on the use of blood components such as fibrinogen and thrombin, which suffer from high cost and short shelf-life. Here, a cost-effective synthetic biomaterial is developed for rapid local hemostasis. Instead of using thrombin, thrombin-receptor-agonist-peptide-6 (TRAP6) is covalently engineered in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels. Soluble PVA-TRAP6 is first prepared by covalent attachment of cysteine-containing TRAP6 onto the backbone of PVA-norbornenes (PVA-NB) through photoconjugation. Cytotoxicity studies using C2C12 myoblasts indicate that PVA-NB and PVA-TRAP6 are nontoxic. Thromboelastography reveals that hemostatic activity of TRAP6 is retained in conjugated form, which is comparable to free TRAP6 solutions with equal concentrations. A 0.1% PVA-TRAP6 solution can shorten the clotting time (CT) to ca. 45% of the physiological CT. High platelet-activating efficiency is further confirmed by platelet aggregation assay and flow cytometry (FACS). For potential clinical applications, TRAP6-presenting hydrogel particulates (PVA-TRAP6-P) are developed for local platelet activation and hemostasis. PVA-TRAP6-P is prepared by biofunctionalization of photopolymerized PVA-NB hydrogel particulates (PVA-NB-P) with TRAP6. It is demonstrated that PVA-TRAP6-P can effectively shorten the CT to ca. 50%. FACS shows that PVA-TRAP6-P can activate platelets to a comparable extent as soluble TRAP6 control. Altogether, PVA-TRAP6-P represents a promising class of biomaterials for safe hemostasis and wound healing.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To compare the pharmacodynamics of once daily and twice daily administration of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) administration in horses. Study Design Randomized cross over study. Animals Adult mixed breed healthy mares (n?=?6). Methods LMWH (dalteparin) was administered (50?U/kg subcutaneously) either every 12 or 24?hours for 3 consecutive days. Anti-factor Xa activity was measured before and at select time points after LMWH administration. Packed cell volume (PCV), platelet count, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and anti-thrombin (AT) activity were monitored throughout the study. Results No changes in PCV, platelet count, or AT activity were detected with either frequency of daily LMWH administration. Values for PTT increased throughout the study but never exceeded the normal reference interval. Anti-factor Xa activity was maintained within or above the suggested thromboprophylactic range (0.1?0.2?U/mL) when LMWH was administered twice daily, but fell below this range ?16?hours after administration when given once daily. For both once and twice daily LMWH administration, the area under the curve was significantly greater after the last dose of LMWH when compared to the first dose. Conclusions Administration of LMWH once or twice daily for 3 consecutive days appears to be safe in healthy adult horses. Anti-factor Xa activity was maintained within or above the suggested thromboprophylactic range for 24?hours with twice daily LMWH administration but not with once daily administration.

AB  - Abstract Aim:? An audit of platelet transfusion was performed to assess adherence to local prophylactic policy and to assess if therapeutic transfusions were administered in line with international recommendations. Methods:? A prospective audit of platelet transfusion therapy was conducted at the Wellington Cancer Centre in patients with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia over a 3-month period from 26 January 2008 to 30 April 2008. There were 398 episodes of evaluable clinical decision activity generated through either platelet counts <50 ? 109/L or platelet transfusion events. Each episode was assessed and defined as either adhering to or breaching the local prophylactic platelet transfusion policy. Results:? Thrombocytopenia and/or platelet transfusion occurred in 63 patients aged 16?84?years with either a haematological or solid organ malignancy. Decisions to withhold prophylactic platelet transfusion in thrombocytopenic patients adhered to policy for 99% of platelet counts <50 ? 109/L. Where transfusions were administered, 77% were prophylactic and 23% were for therapeutic indications. Prophylactic transfusions adhered to policy for 72% of platelet counts <50 ? 109/L. Adherence to prophylactic transfusion policy for febrile patients with a threshold of ≤15 ? 109/L was 84%, compared to 63% for stable afebrile patients with a threshold of ≤10 ? 109/L. Where policy was breached, in 80% of cases the platelet count had not reached the prophylactic transfusion threshold. Of the clinical decisions leading to therapeutic transfusions, 67% were deemed appropriate and predominantly a single adult therapeutic dose of platelets was administered. Where multiple doses of platelets were transfused, 86% of these transfusion events either breached policy or were deemed suboptimal management. Conclusion:? The audit demonstrated a high rate of adherence to local transfusion policy. Where policy was breached, predominantly a transfusion had occurred prior to a platelet count reaching the pre-defined trigger. The use of multiple dose platelet transfusions was almost never appropriate. Educating staff in the use of a stringent transfusion policy may lead to reductions in platelet product use.
