AB  - Abstract Background The Australasian Resuscitation In Sepsis Evaluation (ARISE) study is an international, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of early goal-directed therapy compared with standard care for patients presenting to the ED with severe sepsis. Objective In keeping with current practice, and taking into considerations aspects of trial design and reporting specific to non-pharmacologic interventions, this document outlines the principles and methods for analysing and reporting the trial results. The document is prepared prior to completion of recruitment into the ARISE study, without knowledge of the results of the interim analysis conducted by the data safety and monitoring committee and prior to completion of the two related international studies. Methods The statistical analysis plan was designed by the ARISE chief investigators, and reviewed and approved by the ARISE steering committee. The data collected by the research team as specified in the study protocol, and detailed in the study case report form were reviewed. Information related to baseline characteristics, characteristics of delivery of the trial interventions, details of resuscitation and other related therapies, and other relevant data are described with appropriate comparisons between groups. The primary, secondary and tertiary outcomes for the study are defined, with description of the planned statistical analyses. Results A statistical analysis plan was developed, along with a trial profile, mock-up tables and figures. A plan for presenting baseline characteristics, microbiological and antibiotic therapy, details of the interventions, processes of care and concomitant therapies, along with adverse events are described. The primary, secondary and tertiary outcomes are described along with identification of subgroups to be analysed. Conclusion A statistical analysis plan for the ARISE study has been developed, and is available in the public domain, prior to the completion of recruitment into the study. This will minimise analytic bias and conforms to current best practice in conducting clinical trials.

AB  - Summary All bleeding eventually stops, but it is a matter of timing whether the patient experiences this phenomenon dead or alive. The faster, the more complete, and the more proficient the hemostasis, the better is the patient's chance of recovery. Mere chemistry may help to achieve such timely hemostasis. Systemically administrable drugs, such as tranexamic acid, ε-aminocaproic acid, or desmopressin are available to enhance endogenous coagulation factor production, function, and release. Some drugs are able to modify fibrinolysis and enhance platelet function. There are also drugs that promote local hemostasis. This chapter introduces the reader to practical ways to use such agents to improve the patient's outcome.

AB  - Abstract Bleeding related to portal hypertension and coagulopathy is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis. Complications and management of bleeding is a significant source of healthcare cost and utilization, as well as morbidity and mortality. Due to the scarcity of evidence surrounding transfusion strategies and hemostatic interventions in patients with cirrhosis, there has been significant debate regarding the best practice. Emerging data suggest that evidence supporting transfusion of packed red blood cells to a hemoglobin threshold of 7-8 g/dL is strong. thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonists have shown promise in increasing platelet levels and reducing transfusions preprocedurally, although have not specifically been found to reduce bleeding risk. Data for viscoelastic testing (VET)-guided transfusions appear favorable for reducing blood transfusion requirements prior to minor procedures and during orthotopic liver transplantation. Hemostatic agents such as recombinant factor VIIa, prothrombin complex concentrates, and tranexamic acid have been examined but their role in cirrhotic patients is unclear. Other areas of growing interest include balanced ratio and whole blood transfusion. In the following manuscript, we summarize the most up to date evidence for threshold-guided, VET-guided, balanced-ratio, and whole blood transfusions as well as the use of hemostatic agents in cirrhotic patients to provide practice guidance to clinicians.

AB  - Neuropathy, mechanical stress, and macrovascular disease are involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic foot ulceration. Implicit in the development of gangrene and ulceration is the recognition that these factors interact with the microcirculation, resulting in the failure of skin capillary flow to meet nutritive requirements. There is little evidence to associate structural microangiopathy with foot microcirculatory failure. Significant functional abnormalities of the microcirculation have been defined. In accord with the haemodynamic hypothesis early hyperaemia and capillary hypertension promote more sinister late functional abnormalities with increasing duration of diabetes. These late functional abnormalities include loss of autoregulation and reduced hyperaemic responses which interact with loss of neurogenic flow regulation, disturbed endothelial function, and abnormal rheology to produce the familiar clinical picture of the diabetic foot. Ischaemia secondary to multi-segment arterial disease induces additional abnormalities of microcirculatory function which are superimposed on the pre-existing diabetic microvascular structural and functional microangiopathy.

AB  - Abstract Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare and often fatal soft-tissue infection involving the superficial fascial layers of the extremities, abdomen or perineum. Progression to septic shock can occur very rapidly with its associated high morbidity and mortality. NF is usually caused by beta haemolytic streptococci; less often a poly-microbial isolate is the cause. It typically occurs in patients with some degree of immune dysfunction. We present a case of severe pneumococcal necrotizing fasciitis in an obese patient with Type 2 diabetes. There was no history of trauma or evidence of diabetes-related complications. The initial presentation was with features of septic arthritis of the left knee, which subsequently progressed to NF. Differentiation from cellulitis is often difficult in the early stages. Invasive pneumococcal infections are extremely rare, with only a few reported in the literature. Moreover, our case highlights the need to consider other differential diagnoses (and to look out for complications) in patients with diabetes, especially if there is little clinical response to the initial treatment.

AB  - Background Reye's syndrome (RS) is a rare but severe acute life-threating disease characterized by encephalopathy and fatty liver damage. Reye's syndrome is most common in children and rarely occurs in adults. Case presentation A 56-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with disturbance of consciousness and respiratory failure. She had taken ibuprofen for headache. Her Glasgow Coma Scale score was E3V3M5 on admission. The laboratory findings revealed acute liver failure with prothrombin time ? international normalized ratio of 3.16, aspartate aminotransferase 12,548 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 5,725 IU/L, and blood ammonia 102 ?g/dL. Head magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintense signals on diffusion-weighed images of globus pallidus. We diagnosed the patient with RS induced by influenza A and use of ibuprofen. The patient received supportive care in the intensive care unit and her clinical outcome was favorable. Conclusion Ibuprofen might be a risk factor for RS.

AB  - Summary von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a recognized cause of secondary ankle osteoarthritis (OA). Few studies have examined orthopaedic complications and outcomes in VWD patients treated for end-stage ankle OA with total ankle replacement (TAR). To determine the clinical presentation, intraoperative and postoperative complications and evaluate the mid-term outcome in VWD patients treated with TAR. Eighteen patients with VWD with mean age 47.3 years (range = 34.0?68.7) were treated for end-stage ankle OA with TAR. The mean duration of follow-up was 7.5 years (range = 2.9?13.2). Intraoperative and perioperative complications were recorded. Component stability was assessed with weight-bearing radiographs. Clinical evaluation included range of motion (ROM) tests using a goniometer and under fluoroscopy using a lateral view. Clinical outcomes were analysed by a visual analogue scale, the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society hindfoot score and Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) health survey. One patient sustained an intraoperative medial malleolar fracture. In two patients delayed wound healing was observed. Two secondary major surgeries were performed. Pain level decreased from 8.2 ± 0.9 (range = 7?10) preoperatively to 1.1 ± 1.2 (range = 0?4) postoperatively. Significant functional improvement including ROM was observed. All categories of SF-36 score showed significant improvement in quality of life. Mid-term results of TAR in patients with VWD are encouraging. The total rate of intraoperative and postoperative complications was 33.3%. However, longer term outcomes are necessary to fully understand the clinical benefit of TAR in patients with VWD.

AB  - Objective: To establish normal parameters of thromboelastography (TEG) in healthy adult cats. Background: Thromboelastography (TEG) is an in vitro test of coagulation that has been shown to be useful in humans, dogs and select species to identify and quantify alterations of hemostasis (e.g., hypercoagulable and hypocoagulable states). It has also been demonstrated to be useful in monitoring effects of anticoagulant therapies. This test has not been evaluated in cats. Methods: Blood was collected from 25 clinically normal cats by venipuncture using a 21 gauge?3 1/2 inch butterfly catheter and syringe for medial saphenous or jugular venipuncture. A single 1.8?mL sample in 3.8% Sodium Citrate (9:1) was collected from each cat. Recalcified whole blood was analyzed 30?minutes following collection with the TEG? 5000 analyzer (Haemoscope, Niles, IL). Analysis temperature was 37.6°C. TEG parameters recorded included: R-value (represents initial fibrin formation), K (time from R to standard fixed measure of clot firmness which represents contributions of platelets and fibrinogen), maximum amplitude (MA; represents absolute clot strength), and alpha angle (α; the slope of TEG tracing which represents rate of clot formation). The coagulation index (CI) was derived from the formula generated for humans to provide an overall assessment of whether the sample was hyper- or hypocoagulable. Results: Values for the 25 normal cat samples are reported as mean ±2 standard deviations. R=2.97; 1.23?4.72; K=1.54, 0.38?2.71; α=70.70, 57.76?83.65; MA=58.50, 45.26?71.74 and CI=2.27, 0.07?4.46. Compared to historical information obtained on normal dogs, cats have significantly shorter R and K and larger α, MA and CI. Conclusions: TEG does have reproducible performance when used to evaluate coagulation status in normal cats. Compared to dogs, normal cats favor a hypercoagulable state. Species-specific normal values are necessary for interpretation of TEG results. This test bears potential value for use in future experimental and clinical work to investigate hemostasis in cats receiving anticoagulant therapies or in cats suffering from diseases such as cardiomyopathy which are thought to be associated with altered coagulation status.

AB  - In this special issue of Academic Emergency Medicine, the Editorial Board is privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM), May 22?25, 2000, San Francisco, CA. The depth, breadth, and future of our specialty and our practice are reflected in these brief research summaries; the creativity, talent, and dedication of our researcher colleagues are documented on these pages. We are honored to be able to share them with you. This year, 990 abstracts were received and considered for presentation at the Annual Meeting. Fifty percent were submitted electronically. Each abstract was evaluated by six to nine independent reviewers who were blinded to the author, the study institution, and the other reviewers. Final determinations for acceptance were made by members of the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by Judd Hollander, and the Program Committee chair, Sue Stern. These decisions were based on the mean score received after review and the space available for presentations within the program. The type of presentation (oral platform vs poster), the assigned topic section, and the position of presentation in the program were also determined. As was the case last year, we have reproduced these abstracts from electronic versions supplied by the submitting authors. In general, we have not edited, proofread, changed, or corrected the abstracts; they appear as submitted by the authors, who are responsible for their content. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. The institution listed is that of the presenting author. A list of common abbreviations used in the abstracts begins on page 596. An index to key words, authors, and topics begins on page 598.

AB  - Intercostal catheter placement is common practice in the management of haemothorax and pneumothorax, with over 12,000 being inserted per year (1) in Australian hospitals. It is however an invasive procedure with the potential for significant iatrogenic injury. This is even more pertinent in the trauma setting where stress levels are high and time may be limited. Historically, complications that have been associated with intercostal catheter placement include: lung parenchymal laceration, bleeding from intercostal vessel injury, cardiac injury, ectopic tube placement, empyema, diaphragmatic and intra-abdominal organ laceration. In an attempt to minimise and avoid these complications, there has been a shift in the teaching of the method of tube placement from that of a trocar technique to the blunt dissection (EMST) approach (2). While this will hopefully reduce the rate of procedural complications, it still may not guarantee clinical practice free of complications. Furthermore when these complications are suspected, there is a need for repeated clinical assessment (at times, independent of imaging) in order to allow the early identification any such iatrogenic injury. The presentation will provide a review of the literature and outline the various forms of iatrogenic injury associated with tube thoracostomy; highlight the importance of clinical reassessment following intercostal catheter placement, with particular reference to a case presentation; and discuss techniques to avoid and minimise potential complications.

AB  - The editors of Academic Emergency Medicine are pleased and privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, May 16?19, 2007, in Chicago. The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.

AB  - Summary This chapter is an overview of basic patient evaluation with an eye to anesthetic planning. Important things to evaluate are the patient's overall health status with a thorough physical examination, temperament, body condition score, cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Basic blood work can include just a Packed Cell Volume (PCV) and Total Protein (TP) in healthy patients who are young with no systemic disease. Other tests will be indicated in patients who are geriatric or who have significant disease. The full gamut of possible tests that can be run are outside of the scope of this chapter.

AB  - Heparin is almost universally used as an anticoagulant during hemodialysis. Rare but serious side effects of heparin therapy include heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and anaphylaxis, and these may lead to significant mortality and morbidity if left unrecognized. We are reporting a patient who developed HIT followed by an anaphylactoid reaction. This 8-year-old girl with Joubert's syndrome developed end-stage renal disease secondary to nephronophthisis. She had a Permacath double-lumen hemodialysis catheter placed in the right internal jugular vein and was started on hemodialysis using an Asahi B10 65 Dialyzer on 1/28/03. The platelet count at that time was 246???103/mL. Beef lung heparin was used for anticoagulation. She was admitted for living related donor renal transplant on 2/10/03 but was found to be thrombocytopenic with a platelet count of 49???103/mL. The transplant was postponed, a sepsis work-up was performed, and she was started on antibiotics pending culture results. Hemodialysis was continued with heparin anticoagulation, and despite an improvement in the platelet count she had an acute anaphylactoid reaction 2 days later. The reaction occurred 20?min after starting her hemodialysis treatment and presented as acute onset of bronchospasm, agitation, and chest discomfort. She improved with nebulized albuterol and subcutaneous epinephrine. A review of her records revealed that she had received 6 hemodialysis treatments. The platelet count on 2/3/03, after 3 hemodialysis treatments, had been 242???103/mL and on 2/8/03 after 5 treatments the platelet count was 72???103/mL. HIT with anaphylaxis was suspected. Heparin was discontinued and the platelet count had returned to normal within 2 days. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive heparin-associated antibody test. While HIT is recognized as a complication in 1?5% of patients treated with heparin and has been well described in the literature, we could only find 2 reported cases of heparin-induced anaphylaxis and in both cases there was accompanying thrombocytopenia. This patient further illustrates a possible linkage between these two phenomena. HIT is an important cause of thrombocytopenia in a patient on hemodialysis and continued exposure to heparin may induce anaphylaxis.

AB  - This paper describes three cases of liver lobe torsion in rabbits presenting with anorexia, lethargy, jaundice and abdominal pain. This condition was associated with anaemia and elevation of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Abnormal radiological findings included hepatomegaly, gas-filled intestinal loops consistent with gastrointestinal ileus and ascites. Ultrasonographic findings included heterogeneous liver parenchyma, free abdominal fluid and reduced bowel motility. Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of the liver in all three cases.

AB  - A simple technique for autotransfusion has been developed and used in the successful resuscitation of dogs suffering severe trauma and /or hemorrhage. The purpose of this abstract is three-fold: 1) Describe the criteria used in case selection; 2) Describe the method used; and 3) Describe the results of its use in a limited number of cases. Case Selection: The criteria used were the following: 1. Ongoing significant hemorrhage or severe hemorrhage noted in a body cavity where the blood could be collected; 2. Acute hemorrhage amounts deemed to be life-threatening (>40% calculated blood volume [88?ml/kg]); 3. Where other choices (fresh or stored homologus blood, Oxyglobin) in amounts needed were not possible. Method: Blood was aspirated into a suction canister using a Pool or Yankauer suction tip, with the tip placed under the pool (s) of blood to eliminate as many bubbles in the collection process as possible. If the canister was not sterilized it was scrubbed with a surgical prep solution and then rinsed with tap water prior to blood collection. The blood in the canister was poured into a wide opening in a hanging empty plastic intravenous fluid bag with a blood administration set inserted. The blood was intravenously administered by gravity drip as needed. No attempt was made to use any anticoagulant. Amounts of blood given, clinical responses, and complications were recorded. Results: The procedure was used in 12 dogs: 5 abdominal hemorrhage, 3 thoracic hemorrhage, 2 hemorrhage from both abdomen and chest, 2 vertebral vein hemorrhage. All blood administered was given during the operation or within 2 hours. Amounts transfused ranged from 30 to 120?ml/kg (body weight [mean 48?ml/kg]). No animals died acutely from signs thought to be associated with the transfusion of this blood. Those cases surviving to discharge were 4 abdominal, 2 thoracic, 1 combined, and 1 vertebral vein. There were no infections attributed to the autotransfusion. It is concluded that this technique can be recommended and may be considered life-saving in selected cases.
