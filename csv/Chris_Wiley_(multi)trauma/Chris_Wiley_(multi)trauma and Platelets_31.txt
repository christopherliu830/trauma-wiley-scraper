AB  - This paper reviews the management of head injuries arising in the rural and remote areas of Queensland. Methodology? Data was obtained from the Queensland Trauma Registry from January 2003 to December 2004, a total of 3,088 patients, 1667 classified as major injury. Queensland is the second largest state in Australia with most of the 4 million population living along the eastern seaboard, mainly in the southeast corner and a widely dispersed rural population in small towns. There are neurosurgical services in Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Townsville. Results? Forty percent of patients are referred from another hospital for definitive care with transfer times of up to 10 hours between the referring and definitive care hospital. Of those requiring craniotomy 60% of patients are referred from a another hospital again with lengthy transfer times well beyond the 2 hour transfer time for the deteriorating head injury with intracranial haemorrhage as recommended in the NSA/RACS set of guidelines for the ?Management of Acute Neurotrauma in Rural and Remote Locations?. This paper reviews the problems which include deficient retrieval resources, a reluctance by non-neurosurgeons to perform emergency neurosurgery, a lack of training amongst younger surgeons, and perceived medicolegal issues. The paper also compares the situation in other states and territories. Conclusions? Recommendations are made to improve the delivery of neurotrama care.

AB  - Abstract Objective To review the immune response to injectable anesthetics and sedatives and to compare the immunomodulatory properties between inhalation and injectable anesthetic protocols. Study design Review. Methods and databases Multiple literature searches were performed using PubMed and Google Scholar from March 2012 through November 2013. Relevant anesthetic and immune terms were used to search databases without year published or species constraints. The online database for Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia and the Journal of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care were searched by issue starting in 2000 for relevant articles. Conclusion Sedatives, injectable anesthetics, opioids, and local anesthetics have immunomodulatory effects that may have positive or negative consequences on disease processes such as endotoxemia, generalized sepsis, tumor growth and metastasis, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Therefore, anesthetists should consider the immunomodulatory effects of anesthetic drugs when designing anesthetic protocols for their patients.

AB  - Summary Sickle cell disease (SCD) patients are perceived to have a high mortality when admitted to the Critical Care Unit (CCU). We performed a retrospective analysis of all adult sickle admissions to CCU at a single centre over an 8-year period (1 January 2000 to 31 December 2007). Thirty-eight patients (14 male) were admitted 46 times to CCU; the commonest reasons for admission were acute chest syndrome (14, 30%), multi-organ failure (8, 17%) and planned post-elective surgery (7, 15%). CCU mortality for SCD patients was 19·6%, comparable to a CCU-wide mortality of 17·6% during the study period in the same institution. Re-admission to CCU was high (16% over the 8-year period) but did not increase mortality risk.

AB  - Objective There is a widely recognised need to develop effective Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers to aid the development of disease-modifying treatments, to facilitate early diagnosis and to improve clinical care. This overview aims to summarise the utility of key neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for AD, before focusing on the latest efforts to identify informative blood biomarkers. Design A literature search was performed using PubMed up to September 2011 for reviews and primary research studies of neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, positron emission tomography and amyloid imaging), CSF and blood-based (plasma, serum and platelet) biomarkers in AD and mild cognitive impairment. Citations within individual articles were examined to identify additional studies relevant to this review. Results Evidence of AD biomarker potential was available for imaging techniques reflecting amyloid burden and neurodegeneration. Several CSF measures are promising, including 42 amino acid ?-amyloid peptide (A?42); total tau (T-tau) protein, reflecting axonal damage; and phosphorylated tau (P-tau), reflecting neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Studies of plasma A? have produced inferior diagnostic discrimination. Alternative plasma and platelet measures are described, which represent potential avenues for future research. Conclusions Several imaging and CSF markers demonstrate utility in predicting AD progression and determining aetiology. These require standardisation before forming core elements of diagnostic criteria. The enormous potential available for identifying a minimally-invasive, easily-accessible blood measure as an effective AD biomarker currently remains unfulfilled.

AB  - Aim? To evaluate longer term outcomes of a quality improvement strategy in transfusion. Method? A Clinical Health Improvement Program (CHIP) quality improvement project was conducted in a 290 bed acute general hospital, to decrease the rate of transfusions with high pre-transfusion haemoglobins. Strategies for improvement included: formation of a Transfusion Committee; development of transfusion pathway; implementation of a Maximum Blood Order Schedule; educational strategies targeting clinical staff at all levels; promulgation of the NHRMC Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Use of Blood Components; and feedback to clinicians. The CHIP project was superseded by the ACT Haemovigilance Project, and an ACT wide concurrent transfusion audit was undertaken. There was no formal feedback on clinician performance during, or for 6?months prior to, the Haemovigilance audit. Red cell transfusion was assessed for compliance with the NHMRC Guidelines and compared with CHIP results. Result? The CHIP project demonstrated successful implementation of the selected strategies, leading to a reduction in transfusions with pre-transfusion haemoglobins greater than 90?g/L. Follow up auditing commencing six months later demonstrated a progressive, and statistically significant, increase in inappropriate transfusions over the following six months. Conclusion? Although improvement in transfusion practice was demonstrated with a multi-factorial approach to quality improvement, the improvement was not sustained in the medium term. Our results indicate the need for organisational commitment to long term quality improvement strategies in transfusion, and support the development of Transfusion Officers or Nurses to improve bedside clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract Eleven laboratories paticipated in the First International Workshop of Granulocyte Serology. Participants were asked to identify any granulocyte-reactive antibodies present in 12 human sera distributed as unknown samples. Granulocyte immunofluorescence and granulocyte micro-agglutination were the most commonly used techniques. The incidence of false-positive and false-negative reactions was 15 and 4%, respectively. Most laboratories were able to distinguish between granulocyte-specific and anti-HLA antibodies using platelet absorption. The identification of the specificity of granulocyte-specific antibodies caused the most problems; these were correctly identified on only 57% of occasions.

AB  - ABSTRACT Adult skeletal muscle can regenerate effectively after mild physical or chemical insult. Muscle trauma or disease can overwhelm this innate capacity for regeneration and result in heightened inflammation and fibrotic tissue deposition resulting in loss of structure and function. Recent studies have focused on biomaterial and stem cell-based therapies to promote skeletal muscle regeneration following injury and disease. Many stem cell populations besides satellite cells are implicated in muscle regeneration. These stem cells include but are not limited to mesenchymal stem cells, adipose-derived stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, pericytes, fibroadipogenic progenitors, side population cells, and CD133+ stem cells. However, several challenges associated with their isolation, availability, delivery, survival, engraftment, and differentiation have been reported in recent studies. While acellular scaffolds offer a relatively safe and potentially off-the-shelf solution to cell-based therapies, they are often unable to stimulate host cell migration and activity to a level that would result in clinically meaningful regeneration of traumatized muscle. Combining stem cells and biomaterials may offer a viable therapeutic strategy that may overcome the limitations associated with these therapies when they are used in isolation. In this article, we review the stem cell populations that can stimulate muscle regeneration in vitro and in vivo. We also discuss the regenerative potential of combination therapies that utilize both stem cell and biomaterials for the treatment of skeletal muscle injury and disease. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Regenerative medicine has sparked interest in potential strategies for bone repair. Bone defects are widespread and could be caused by trauma, congenital malformations, infections, and surgery. Although bone has a large self-healing capacity, some defects or fractures are too big to regenerate. To regenerate bone structures which can be used for treatment of patients, bone growth must be induced by a number of bioactive implantable materials, cell types and intracellular, and extracellular molecular signaling pathways. Since mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their differentiation during remodeling processes have important roles in bone regeneration, it is believed that understanding molecular signaling pathways involved is crucial to the development of bone implants, bone substitute materials, and cell-based scaffolds for bone regeneration. In this review, we briefly introduce concepts in fracture repair and regeneration following bone injuries, and then discuss the current clinical methods in bone regeneration. In the next section, we review the involvement of the various key signaling pathways in bone regeneration.

AB  - Background and aim? Three serious transfusion-related incidents over a 9?month period highlighted the clinical risk in transfusion during 2001?2002. This lead to the development of a strategy to comprehensively review and implement transfusion safety initiatives across the Bayside health network of which the Alfred is a major hospital. Intervention The initiative commenced in January 2003 with the assembly of a multi-disciplinary team that consisted of medical, nursing, scientific as well as hospital executive representation. This was possible with the appointment of a Transfusion Nurse as part of the Victorian Department of Human Services Blood Matters Collaborative and a Transfusion Medicine Registrar, co-appointed by the hospital and Australian Red Cross Blood Service. The activities consisted initially of process mapping blood transfusion practice. Key areas were then selected for targeting process improvement, namely; ? Patient and product identification, ? Sample labelling, ? Blood component administration. Result? Initiatives implemented were; ? Widespread medical and nursing education on transfusion issues. ? Increase transfusion information availability. ? Network-wide implementation of strict criteria for specimen labelling (all specimens) in line with ANZSBT pre-transfusion testing guidelines. ? Development of a pre-transfusion testing and blood request form. ? Development of a blood administration form to reconcile all transfusion related documentation in the medical record. - Policy and guideline development. Conclusion? Sustained improvement requires ongoing dedicated personnel to maintain gains, continue to audit practice, analyse incident data both actual adverse incidents as well as near-miss events and to respond to these challenges within an ongoing and operational quality improvement framework.
