AB  - Objective To test the effect of pentoxifylline, a hemorheologic agent used to treat intermittent claudication, on the course of vascular dementia. Design Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial. Setting Outpatient tertiary care center. Patients 64 patients meeting DSM-III criteria for multi-infarct dementia with modified Hachinski ischemic scores ≥6, 38 of whom completed the trial. Intervention Pentoxifylline (Trental?) 400 milligram tablets three times daily vs placebo for 36 weeks. Main Outcome Measure Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS). Results Baseline demographic values and psychometric variables were similar in the placebo and control groups; endpoint statistical analysis was used to allow the use of data from all patients in this clinically high-risk group. For the total group, the slowing of deterioration did not reach statistical significance (by 2-tailed t test), as measured by scores on the total ADAS (P = 0.058) or on the cognitive (ADAS items 1?11; P = 0.064) or non-cognitive subscales (ADAS items 12?21; P = 0.234), although it was significant on the cognitive subscales excluding memory (ADAS items 2?6, 8?10; P = 0.036). For the subgroup of 40 patients who had CT and/or MRI evidence of stroke as well as meeting the other inclusion criteria, treatment with pentoxifylline was associated with significantly slower deterioration, as measured by the total ADAS (P = 0.023) and cognitive subscores (P = 0.020) but not non-cognitive subscores (P = 0.118). For the subgroup of 37 patients who had at least one discrete clinical stroke, treatment with pentoxifylline was associated with significantly less deterioration on the total ADAS (P = 0.002) and both the cognitive (P = 0.001) and non-cognitive (P = 0.017) subscores. Conclusion Treatment with pentoxifylline may slow the progression of dementia in patients who meet DSM-III criteria for ?multi-infarct dementia? and who also have clinical and neuroradiological evidence of cerebrovascular disease.

AB  - Abstract Accurate assessment of the pregnant patient in the ED depends on knowledge of physiological changes in pregnancy, and how these changes may impact on pathology tests, appearance on point-of-care ultrasound and electrocardiography. In addition the emergency physician needs to be cognisant of disorders that are unique to or more common in pregnancy. Part 1 of this review addresses potential deviations in laboratory investigation reference intervals resulting from physiological alterations in pregnancy, and the important causes of abnormal laboratory results in pregnancy. Part 2 will address the role of point-of-care ultrasound in pregnancy, physiological changes that may affect interpretation of point-of-care ultrasound, physiological changes in electrocardiography, and the safety of radiological procedures in the pregnant patient.

AB  - Because of the cost and complexity of treating immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) cases, it is important to find accurate prognostic factors. Most information to date has come from retrospective university studies with varying treatment protocols. To better identify prognostic indicators in cases diagnosed with IMHA, a prospective study with a standardized treatment protocol was undertaken. Diagnosis of IMHA was based on standard published criteria and effective rule out of other diseases. For each IMHA case admitted, historical, treatment and clinical data were documented during hospitalization. All discharged cases were followed for at least 3 months. Of 31 cases originally enrolled in the study, 26 cases were available for analysis in determining chance for discharge and 21 cases were available in determining longer term prognosis. All cases were autoagglutinating. Eighteen cases were discharged (69%), 1 case died, and 7 cases were euthanized in the hospital due to a grave prognosis. Cases that died or were euthanized in the hospital had a significantly higher maximum total bilirubin (Tbili) level than those that were discharged (33.5 versus 4.8, p=0.0004). Between cases that were discharged and those that died or were euthanized, there was no difference in age, packed cell volume, white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count or Tbili on admission, or the presence of hemoglobinuria or hemoglobinemia. The number of transfusions received and hospitalization time were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Only 3 animals had been vaccinated within 2 months; of those, 1 was euthanized and 2 were discharged. Three-month follow-up information was available for 13 of the 18 cases discharged. Of the 13, 7 cases were still alive at 3 months (7/21, 33%). There was no difference in age, PCV, WBC, platelet count, total bilirubin at admission, number of transfusions received, or hospitalization time between survivors and non-survivors. None of the animals that lived over 3 months had hemoglobinemia or hemoglobinuria during their hospitalization. Maximum Tbili was significantly higher in non-survivors versus survivors (23.7 versus 1.9, p=0.0005). A total bilirubin of greater than 5.16 during hospitalization was associated with an extremely poor prognosis.

AB  - Objectives: 1) Describe the clinical course and diagnostic findings of cats with histopathologic evidence of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 2) Identify risk factors for ALI/ARDS in cats. Animals: Sixty-five client-owned cats with moderate to severe interstitial pneumonia, pneumonitis or alveolitis consistent with ALI/ARDS on post-mortem examination and clinical evidence of respiratory compromise. Procedure: Retrospective evaluation of medical records, postmortem examination and radiographs. Results: Cats in this study tended to be middle aged (mean 6.5±4.9 years). They had a short duration of illness (median 4 days; range 0?120 days) and of dyspnea (median 1 day; range 1?7 days). On presentation, the cats were tachypneic (mean respiratory rate 53±23?bpm) and relatively bradycardic (mean heart rate 166±43?bpm). The majority of cats were dyspneic (n=39) at presentation; all others developed respiratory difficulties during hospitalization. The mean white blood cell count was within normal limits (14.6±14.0?k/?L); 8 cats had a leukocytosis and 7 were leucopenic. Clinical findings consistent with SIRS (n=39) and sepsis (n=10) were common. Thoracic radiographs were reviewed in 31 cats and alveolar disease was the most frequent pattern (105 lung lobes) followed by interstitial disease (86 lung lobes). No cat had normal thoracic radiographs throughout hospitalization. Underlying disease was not identified on post-mortem examination in 15 cats (23%), but in the remaining cats underlying diseases included infectious systemic disease (n=11), neoplasia (n=8), respiratory (n=8) and urinary (n=7) system disorders, acute pancreatitis (n=7), hepatic diseases (n=5), major trauma (n=4), sepsis (n=3), CNS (n=2) and other systems (n=5). Nine cats had more then one underlying process. Conclusions: This study describes a naturally-occurring syndrome of ALI/ARDS in cats analogous to that which occurs in dogs and humans. In cats, ALI/ARDS occurs as a sequela of a variety of underlying systemic diseases, but in approximately one-quarter of patients an underlying cause is not identified at necropsy. It is important to consider ALI/ARDS in systemically ill cats who become dyspneic; in cats with pulmonary disease with acute worsening of respiratory status and in cats with pulmonary infiltrates for which no other cause can be identified.

AB  - Summary This chapter summarizes assessment and management of the patient with sepsis. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory, cellular and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than sepsis alone. Management of sepsis requires invasive monitoring and critical care expertise. Arterial and central venous monitoring will be required if the patient is in septic shock or once in the ICU but placement should not delay initial priorities. The first priority is adequate fluid resuscitation, using a balanced crystalloid. This should be guided by a clinical assessment of the circulation and tissue perfusion. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in sepsis and is associated with a worse outcome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a complication of sepsis. This should be suspected in patients with sepsis and also in patients with septic shock who develop purpura, prolonged oozing from puncture sites or bleeding from the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts.

AB  - Summary In the United Kingdom, when a patient complains that he/she has impaired vision, the first port of call is frequently an optometrist and if spectacles are not the answer a further referral is made to a hospital through the general practitioner. Unilateral visual field defects that present in this way are commonly caused by focal retinal pathology, congenital optic nerve defects, glaucoma, optic disc drusen, previous trauma, compressive lesions and as chronic sequelae of subclinical branch retinal artery and vein occlusions or demyelinating optic neuritis. The diagnostic problem of progressive bilateral visual loss is usually solvable with a clear understanding of the knowledge of the visual pathways, patterns of visual symptoms and careful examination. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) permits non-cross-sectional imaging of internal structures in biological tissues using near infra-red light. Optic nerve lesions generally lead to monocular visual loss and pain is a frequent accompanying features.

AB  - In civilian trauma concerns about tourniquet-related problems has rendered tourniquets virtually obselete. The use of tourniquets in a battlefield setting however remains surrounded by controversy. Whilst many accept that if properly used, tourniquets can be life saving devices, opinion is divided regarding its role. Some surgeons have recommended abolition of the tourniquet, whist others advocate that every combat solder should be issued with a tourniquet as part of their personal equipment. The recent introduction of the self applied C-A-T tourniquet into the Australian Defence Force has re-ignited controversy as to the appropriate role of tourniquets in an operational setting. During Vietnam, Desert Storm and Somalia haemorrhage from extremity wounds was a leading cause of preventable combat deaths. Improvements in body armour and increased exposure to blast injury has resulted in a relative increase in limb injuries in recent operations. Experience in Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan particularly by Special Operations communities has led to a re-assessment of the efficacy of battlefield tourniquet systems. The C-A-T tourniquet has been widely used in Iraq and Afghanistan. No iatrogenic injury has been reported, even with tourniquet times up to 8 hours. This paper will discuss the history of tourniquet use in the military from its first introduction in 1674 to the most recent ADF doctrine (ADFP XXX). It will also present trial results from the UK and US and recommendations from the 2006 Advanced Technologies Applied to Combat Casualty Care Conference (ATACC). This paper will address the basis of current doctrine and provide a case for and against the use of tourniquets in an operational setting.

AB  - Objectives: 1) Validate a chromogenic assay to measure Factor Xa inhibitory activity (anti-Xa activity) in normal feline plasma and following administration of low molecular weight heparins and unfractionated heparin. 2) Compare the effects of two commercially available low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), unfractionated heparin (UFH), and placebo on TEG, anti-Xa activity, PT/aPTT, PCV/TS and platelet count in healthy cats. Methods: Our study consisted of two phases: 1) the evaluation of a commercially available chromogenic anti-Xa assay (Rotachrom Heparin, Diagnostic Stago) for use in cats, and 2) the evaluation of hemostatic effects of LMWH in healthy cats. Phase 1: The anti-Xa assay was validated for use in cats using feline plasma and serial dilutions of the plasma spiked with UFH, enoxaparin, and dalteparin. Phase 2: Five healthy cats were included in a randomized Latin Squares model crossover-design to compare the effects of UFH and LMWH in cats. The cats then received one of the following subcutaneously: 1) 250?IU/kg UFH QID, 2) 100?IU/kg dalteparin BID, 3) 1?mg/kg enoxaparin BID, 4) 0.25?mL/kg 0.9% saline (placebo) QID. A minimum of a two-week washout period separated each treatment period. Each drug was administered for 5 days. Blood samples were obtained to measure anti-Xa, TEG, PT/aPTT, platelet count, and PCV/TS on Days 1, 3, 5, and 6 of each treatment cycle. Samples were collected at time 0 on each sample day for all parameters and on select days at hours 4, 8, and 12 for anti-Xa and TEG. Results: Preliminary results using the validated anti-Xa assay (from the first part of this study) demonstrate that LMWH treatment results in peak anti-Xa activity at the 4-hour sampling time that returned toward baseline by 8 hours (in 5/6 cats treated with LMWH thus far). Similar anticoagulant effects were noted in the TEG parameters of cats receiving LMWH (i.e., peak effects were noted at 4 hours). Analysis of current data by linear regression identifies a relationship between anti-Xa measurements and TEG parameters for cats treated with all heparin therapies (p<0.001). A similar relationship exists between anti-Xa and aPTT. Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest an anticoagulant effect of LMWH in cats that may not be uniform across individuals. Anti-Xa activity or TEG may provide useful tools for monitoring LMWH.

AB  - Abstract Fournier's gangrene (FG) is a fulminant necrotizing fasciitis of the external genitalia. Few reports of FG exist in patients with hematologic malignancies. We describe a case of fatal FG in a 21-year-old man with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who was receiving remission-induction chemotherapy. Despite early local surgery, administration of appropriate antibiotics, resurgery for wider debridement and aggressive ICU support he succumbed while pancytopenic to septic shock, 26 days after initiation of chemotherapy. Multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from blood and scrotal cultures obtained at initial surgery. FG is a fulminant infection, especially in the face of profound cytopenias.

Cats were accepted into the study if their dermatologic signs were related to probable flea allergy and/or atopy, their signs did not abate with increased flea control alone and they were not on any concurrent anti-inflammatory drugs or supplements. They were initially placed on 4 weeks of intense flea control then randomly in a double-blinded manner placed on either 8 weeks of EPO liquid or olive oil (control). Pruritus, erythema, self-trauma, alopecia and overall dermatologic condition were monitored and scored at 4-week intervals for the entire 12 weeks of study. The mean of each parameter for each group (EPO or olive oil) was compared to itself over time and to the other group using an analysis of variance with repeated measures. No significant difference (P? 0.05) was noted over time or between groups for any of the five parameters.

AB  - Summary Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in around10-20%of patients admitted to hospital, and is most often due to hypovolaemia/hypotension, sepsis and nephrotoxins. This chapter summarizes stage-based management of AKI. It also summarizes monitoring and supportive care in AKI. Three common scenarios are encountered: corrected hypovolaemia/hypotension, with improving renal function; persisting/worsening AKI despite correction of hypovolaemia/hypotension and removal of nephrotoxins; and suspected urinary tract obstruction. Prompt and vigorous correction of hypovolaemia and hypotension will often reverse AKI. If there is clinically obvious hypovolaemia, IV fluid is given. Treatment of the trigger of deterioration and avoidance of hypovolaemia (preferably by albumin administration) can help to decrease the incidence of AKI. A CVP line may be helpful (to avoid over-replacement of fluid), but the patient should be resuscitated first before this is placed. Ultrasonography of the inferior vena cava is one of the methods to assess the CVP.

AB  - Ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is of obvious relevance in situations where there is an interruption of blood supply to the gut, as in vascular surgery, or in the construction of free intestinal grafts. It is now appreciated that IRI also underlies the gut dysfunction that occurs in early shock, sepsis, and trauma. The events that occur during IRI are complex. However, recent advances in cellular biology have started to unravel these underlying processes. The aim of this review is to provide an outline of current knowledge on the mechanisms and consequences of IRI. Initially, IRI appears to be mediated by reactive oxygen metabolites and, at a later stage, by the priming and activation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). Ischaemia-reperfusion injury can diminish the barrier function of the gut, and can promote an increase in the leakage of molecules (intestinal permeability) or the passage of microbes across the wall of the bowel (bacterial trans-location). Ischaemia-reperfusion injury to the gut can result in the generation of molecules that may also harm distant tissues.

AB  - SUMMARY Allogeneic blood transfusions expose a patient to many soluble and cell-bound antigens, expressed on viable and decaying cells. In particular, contaminant leukocytes are presumed to play an important role interacting with the recipient's immune system. This immune response to transfusions is influenced by the condition of the patient, and a patient in steady state will respond differently to a patient in hemorrhagic shock, under anesthesia or after surgical tissue injury. Blood transfusions affect both the innate immediate defense immune system and the adaptive immune response, the latter often resulting in antibodies and (less well characterized) cellular immunity. Removal of allogeneic leukocytes by filtration of red cells and platelet products significantly reduces febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions and the formation of leukocyte antibodies, causing refractoriness to platelet transfusions. However, an effect of leukocyte-containing transfusions on cellular immune functions relevant to transplant tolerance, cancer surveillance, viral replication or susceptibility to nosocomial infections is less obvious. Randomized studies showed a significant effect of removal of allogeneic leukocytes in blood transfused to cardiac surgery patients, reducing postoperative mortality. As for the other reported clinical effects of (passenger) leukocytes in blood transfusions, there is not yet sufficient evidence.
