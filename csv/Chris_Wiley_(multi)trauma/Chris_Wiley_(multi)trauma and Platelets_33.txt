AB  - Abstract Objectives To present Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response (EPRR) guidance for Hospital Transfusion Teams on behalf of the National Blood Transfusion Committee emergency planning working group. Background The Civil Contingencies Act 2004 requires healthcare organisations to demonstrate that they can deal with major incidents while maintaining critical services. Recent mass casualty events and the use of transfusion-based resuscitation have highlighted the evolving role of the Hospital Transfusion Team. Methods This multi-disciplinary advice is informed by recent global and national experience, the 2018 NHS England clinical guidelines for Major Incidents, and stakeholder workshops. Guidance Transfusion staff should be familiar with local EPRR plans including casualty type and numbers. Staff should be exercised as part of wider Trust preparation, with documented roles and responsibilities. Transfusion support should be proactive and include blood issue, regulatory compliance and sample handling. Robust LIMS-compatible emergency identification systems are essential to minimise errors. Emergency stock management requires rapid assessment of existing stock and estimated demand before re-ordering. Initial demand should be based on 2 to 4 red blood cells (RBC) per patient admitted. Patients with significant haemorrhage may require further red cells and early haemostatic support. Where ?universal? components are demanded, they should be gender appropriate. Senior staff should lead the response, log and communicate key decisions, and prepare for post-incident recovery. Conclusions Transfusion teams have an important role in ensuring continuity of transfusion support. Teams should develop their EPRR plans based on local plans and national guidance. Emergency preparedness should include post-incident debriefing for ongoing staff support and future service improvement.

AB  - Abstract.? Bounameaux H (Division of Angiology and Hemostasis, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospitals of Geneva and Faculty of Medicine, Geneva, Switzerland). Contemporary management of pulmonary embolism: the answers to ten questions (Review). J Intern Med 2010; 268: 218?231. Pulmonary embolism (PE) cannot be diagnosed solely on a clinical basis, because of the lack of sensitivity and specificity of clinical signs and symptoms. Pulmonary angiography is invasive and resource demanding. Because the prevalence of PE is relatively low (20% or less) amongst individuals who are clinically suspected of having the disease, submitting all of them to imaging (multi-detector CT angiography or ventilation/perfusion lung scintigraphy) would not be cost-effective. Therefore, diagnostic algorithms have been developed that include clinical probability assessment and D-dimer measurement to select the patients who require noninvasive imaging. Once the diagnosis is suspected or confirmed, therapy must be started to avoid potentially fatal recurrence. Treatment starts for an initial 3-month period with a 5-day course of parenteral unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux overlapping with and followed by oral vitamin K antagonists monitored to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2?3. This initial period of 3?months may then be followed by a long-term secondary prevention period in patients who experience an idiopathic thromboembolic event and are at low risk of bleeding. New oral anticoagulants that do require patient monitoring and might exhibit a more favourable benefit?risk balance are currently under extensive clinical testing and might change the situation in the near future. A critical appraisal of the contemporary management of suspected PE is given in this overview with the discussion of 10 practical questions.

AB  - Hypoalbuminemia and decreased colloid osmotic pressure (COP) are common in critically ill dogs. Hypoalbuminemia has been shown to negatively impact outcome. Treatment strategies to raise COP include the use of both natural and synthetic colloids. To date there is no comprehensive evaluation of human albumin (HA) use in dogs. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the use of 25% HA in critically ill dogs. The medical records of all dogs receiving HA between January 2003 and March 2004 were reviewed using a standardized data sheet for signalment, diagnoses, Survival Prediction Index (SPI), dose of HA administered, amount of crystalloid fluid administered prior to HA administration, length of hospitalization (LOH), complications, and outcome. Additionally pre- and post-HA administration values for serum albumin (SA), blood COP, and total solids (TS) were evaluated. Thirty-seven dogs received HA. Thirty of the 37 dogs (81%) underwent surgery and 13 of 37 (39%) dogs were diagnosed with septic peritonitis. Other diagnoses included trauma, wounds, neoplasia, gastric ulcer, and pancreatitis. The median SPI of all dogs was 0.53 (range 0.06?0.82). Median dose of HA used was 1.5?g/kg (range 0.38?3.64?g/kg). Median dose of crystalloid fluids administered prior to HA administration was 6.23?ml/kg/hr (range 1.2?45.4?ml/kg/hr). Median LOH was 5 days (range 1?16 days). Mild complications were encountered in 9 of 37 (24%) dogs and included prolonged clotting times (n=3), increased breathing effort (n=3), vomiting (n=2), and fever (n=1). Of the 37 dogs in the study, 21 (57%) survived, 10 (27%) died, and 6 (16%) were euthanized. After HA administration, median SA increased from 1.5?g/dl (range 1.0?2.1?g/dl) to 2.8?g/dl (range 1.5?4.4?g/dl) (p<0.001), median COP increased from 11?mmHg (range 6.8?13.8?mmHg) to 14.4?mmHg (range 11?26.9?mmHg) (p<0.001), and median TS increased from 2.9?g/dl (range 0.9?4.6?g/dl) to 4.0 (range 2.8?6.2) (p<0.001). When compared to non-survivors, survivors had higher post-HA administration SA (p=0.008), higher net COP increase (p=0.032), and received higher dosages of HA (p=0.046). Pre-treatment SA, COP, or the development of complications during administration did not impact LOH or outcome. In this retrospective study, HA administration effectively increased SA, TS and COP in critically ill dogs and was associated with relatively few complications. Future studies are warranted to further evaluate the potential benefits of HA administration.

AB  - Abstract The risk of post-operative bleeding is a daily concern for many general dental practitioners. A thorough medical and medication history must be taken in order to consider all risk factors, particularly drugs, that contribute to bleeding risk. While the risk from drugs such as aspirin, warfarin and clopidogrel are well-known, the extent to which new anti-platelet agents and direct oral anticoagulants affect bleeding risk is less well understood. In addition, there are drugs other than anti-thrombotics, such as antidepressants and complementary medicines that also impair haemostasis. The aim of this paper is to provide dentists with an updated overview of the drugs commonly encountered in general dental practice that can contribute to a patient?s post-operative bleeding risk.

AB  - Summary The priority in treating the equine patient with acute diarrhoea is to stabilise the haemodynamic aberrations secondary to the fluid and electrolyte losses. Once this has been initiated and the patient is stabilised ancillary treatments may be beneficial. Besides the well established effects of NSAIDs and polymixin B on systemic inflammation, recent studies suggest that the use of DTOS to bind bacterial toxins and Saccharomyces boulardii to reduce the severity and duration of diarrhoea may be beneficial. The justification for using probiotic products is scant. There is no evidence to suggest that systemic use of antimicrobials benefits equine patients with colitis, with the exception of metronidazole in cases of clostridial diarrhoea. In light of their potentially detrimental effects, their use can, in the opinion of the authors, not be advocated. Better understanding of the pathways of systemic inflammation and more selective anti-inflammatory drugs may be of great benefit in the future.

AB  - Summary This chapter commences with the management of suspected giant cell arteritis (GCA). It is recommended to consider vasculitis in the patient with systemic symptoms and headache or evidence of organ dysfunction. The diagnosis of a specific vasculitis is based on the pattern of organ injury, characteristic features on imaging, the size of involved blood vessels and histological findings on biopsy. GCA usually presents with new-onset headache in older people, associated with constitutional upset; it carries a significant risk (20-30%) of visual loss from ischaemic optic neuropathy, and so needs urgent assessment and treatment. Typical presentations of acute vasculitis include headache, neurological presentation with stroke, hearing loss, and haemoptysis. With the exception of suspected GCA, early intervention with high-dose corticosteroid therapy is rarely needed, and should not be given unless advised by a specialist. The chapter also presents information on considerations in suspected GCA and new presentation of suspected systemic vasculitis.

AB  - Summary We report four years of observational data from a large UK hospital and tertiary referral unit, following the introduction of a rotational thromboelastometry-guided algorithm for treatment of coagulopathy in major obstetric haemorrhage. Fibrinogen concentrate was used to treat acquired hypofibrinogenaemia as defined by a FibTEM A5 value of <Â 7Â mm, or 7?12Â mm with ongoing or high risk of haemorrhage. Of 32,647 deliveries over 4Â years, 893 (2.7%) women had an estimated blood loss â‰¥Â 1500Â ml. Two-hundred and three (23%) of these had a FibTEM A5 â‰¤Â 12Â mm and 110 received fibrinogen concentrate. We compared clinical outcomes and blood product use with 52 patients who met the same criteria, over a 12-month pre-intervention period during which shock packs were used. In the algorithm group, there was a significant reduction in the number of units (pÂ <Â 0.0001) and total volume (pÂ =Â 0.0007) of blood products transfused, with a reduction in transfusion-associated circulatory overload (pÂ =Â 0.002). Women with placental abruption exhibited more severe coagulopathy and required higher doses of fibrinogen concentrate than women who bled due to other causes. Analysis of rotational thromboelastometry results demonstrated that coagulopathy is not observed in all women who suffer obstetric haemorrhage and cannot be predicted solely by blood loss. Therefore, formulaic treatment with blood products is not justified. When coagulopathy does occur, it appears to be multifactorial and can be severe. Point-of-care testing allows early identification and individualised treatment of coagulopathy. This is supported by the improved outcomes reported.

AB  - Background: Idiopathic thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare yet potentially fatal thrombotic microangiopathy. Severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity via autoantibody formation has been associated with idiopathic TTP; however, specific triggers are poorly defined. Previous studies have reported seasonal associations of TTP, with warm-weather seasons appearing to have the strongest predilection. We characterized the seasonal distribution of severe ADAMTS13 deficient idiopathic TTP at our multi-hospital institution. Methods: Apheresis records from 2005?2012 were queried for patients with a clinical diagnosis of TTP, accompanying pre-plasmapheresis ADAMTS13 activity <10%, and no other explanations for thrombotic microangiopathy. Date of admission and ADAMTS13 activity were collected. Both initial episodes and relapses in patients whose initial episodes occurred since 2005 were included in the analysis. Goodness-of-fit chi-square analysis was performed and statistical significance was defined as p<0.05. Results: Of 237 consecutive new patients with a suspected clinical diagnosis of TTP, 73 patients met inclusion criteria and had a total of 110 unique presentations for either initial TTP episodes or TTP relapses. Sixteen patients had 37 relapses of their idiopathic TTP (range 1?7). No statistically significant seasonal or monthly associations were identified with either initial or any TTP episodes. Conclusion: A seasonal association of severe ADAMTS13 deficient idiopathic TTP was not observed. Unknown variables may explain previous observations of seasonal associations of idiopathic TTP in other regions of the United States. Thus, individual institutions should characterize their own seasonal distributions of idiopathic TTP as part of the exploration of possible disease triggers in their respective areas. J. Clin.

Background Balloon angioplasty is currently the Gold Standard to treat below-the-knee disease; however, restenosis continues to be a great challenge following these percutaneous revascularization procedures. Methods The Occlusion Perfusion Catheter for Optimal Delivery of Paclitaxel for the Prevention of Endovascular Restenosis (COPPER-A) study?Below-the-Knee Cohort was a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter, feasibility, and safety study that enrolled 35 patients at 11 participating sites. The safety endpoints at 1, 3, and 6 months were freedom from thrombosis, major amputation in the target limb and target limb related death. The efficacy endpoints were primary patency and freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization at 6 months. Results All patients tolerated the procedure well with no reports of adverse procedural events. Thirty-five patients were treated with a mean lesion length of 112?Â±?81.2?mm with the lesion length range of 20?286?mm. At 6-month follow-up, primary patency was 89.3% and freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization was 96.4%. No patients demonstrated thrombosis, major amputation in the target limb and target limb related death at the 1-, 3- and 6-months follow-up intervals. Conclusions The results of this multi-center study demonstrated that infrapopliteal arteries can be safely and effectively treated with liquid paclitaxel using the occlusion perfusion catheter.

AB  - Summary Biliary tract emergencies include gallstone pancreatitis, cholangitis, bile leak, and acute cholecystitis. Urgent ERCP (within 24 hours after admission) is indicated in patients with gallstone pancreatitis who have concurrent acute cholangitis, but it is not needed in most patients who do not have evidence of ongoing biliary obstruction. The treatment goal of acute cholangitis is biliary decompression by re-establishing patency of the biliary system. The primary goal of endoscopic treatment of bile leaks is directed at reducing biliary pressure. This is accomplished in several ways including performing a biliary sphincterotomy and/or placement of a bile duct stent across the papilla. The timing of cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis has been debated and is discussed in this chapter.

AB  - We present a review of the impact of intensivists and ICU teams on patient outcomes, with specific emphasis on varying hospital environments and study designs. While the demand for critical care services is likely to increase, 50% of ICU patients still receive care from nonintensivists in conjunction with consultants. While no ?standard? of critical care practice exists, costs are substantial: there are about 55,000 ICU patients/day in the United States, and organizational structures vary substantially. ICU outcome studies can be divided into three groups: multi-institutional comparisons, before-and-after studies, and side-by-side comparisons. Multi-institutional comparisons have tended to show improved outcomes in well-organized ICUs, with strong medical direction and on-site intensivists. The change from an ?open? to a ?closed? format for ICU care is associated with decreased low-acuity admissions, resource utilization and mortality rates, and improved efficiency. Side-by-side comparisons have demonstrated improved efficiency, decreased complications, and decreased resource use on ICU services directed by an intensivist.
