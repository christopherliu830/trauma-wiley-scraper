AB  - Background Keratoconus manifests as a conical protrusion of the cornea and is characterised by stromal thinning. This causes debilitating visual impairment, which may necessitate corneal transplantation. Hypothetically, many of the pathological features in keratoconus may be manifestations of defects in wound healing; however, as the pathobiology remains unclear, therapeutic targets related to disease mechanisms are currently lacking. This study investigated the protein expression of cytokines which may control stromal wound healing and the effect of an induced secondary injury (SI) on stromal cells from ex vivo human keratoconus and control corneas. Methods Total protein was extracted from stromal cells from human keratoconic and non-keratoconic central corneas (n = 12) with (+SI) and without (-SI) an ex vivo corneal incision wound. The levels of interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1α), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), nerve growth factor beta (?-NGF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-?1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) were quantified using chemiluminescence-based immunoarrays. Results In stromal cells from -SI keratoconic corneas (compared with -SI normal corneas), the levels of IL-1α, IGF-1, TNF-α and TGF-?1 were increased and the levels of HGF and ?-NGF were reduced. These alterations were also observed in +SI non-keratoconic corneas (compared with -SI non-keratoconic corneas). In stromal cells from +SI keratoconic corneas (compared with -SI keratoconic corneas), the quantities of IL-1α, FGF-2, TNF-a, EGF, TGF-a1 and PDGF were decreased. Conclusion The repair-modulating milieu in keratoconic corneas appears comparable to that in wounded normal corneas. Moreover, wounded keratoconic corneas may be less capable of orchestrating a normal reparative response. These novel findings may improve our understanding of the pathobiology and may facilitate the identification of potential biological targets and therapeutic agents to advance the clinical management of this disorder.

AB  - Abstract Severe thrombocytopenia poses a high risk for bleeding thus representing a relative contraindication for anticoagulation and therefore extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We herein report on a series of immunocompromised patients with severe thrombocytopenia undergoing long-term ECMO without systemic anticoagulation. We retrospectively identified seven adult patients with anticoagulation withdrawal for ≥3 days (range 5?317) during venovenous ECMO therapy due to thrombocytopenia < 50 G/L treated in a university-affiliated hospital from January 2013 to April 2017. All ECMO systems used were heparin coated. Overall, 530 ECMO days were observed, 404 (76%) of them without systemic anticoagulation. Platelet count during ECMO treatment was 24 G/L (median, range 1-138), ECMO duration was 35 days (5-317), and ECMO was run without any anticoagulation for 20 days (5-317). Altogether, five clotting events were seen leading to oxygenator exchanges. Bleeding was common including one fatal intracerebral hemorrhage. Altogether, 29 platelet concentrates per patient (7-207) were administered, which correspond to 0.8 per day (0.6-1.3). One patient survived ICU and hospital. In patients with thrombocytopenia, ECMO can be run without anticoagulation even for considerably long periods of time. Bleeding remains common, while clotting events seem to be rare. However, prognosis of this patient population undergoing ECMO support seems grim.

AB  - This review summarises the current understanding of immune response and T cell subsets in the context of development of autoimmunity in the dog. Mode of action and rational usage in immune-mediated disease in the dog are discussed for the following drugs: glucocorticoids, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, human intravenous immunoglobulin, vincristine, danazol, leflunomide, mycophenolate mofetil and liposome-encapsulated clodronate. Disease mechanisms are discussed and published evidence for drug efficacy is scrutinised for five important immune-mediated diseases: immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, myasthenia gravis, glomerulonephritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Future strategies for more refined manipulation of adverse immune responses are presented.

AB  - Abstract Aims To synthesize the evidence evaluating if blood samples are similar when obtained from peripheral intravenous cannula compared with venepuncture. Design A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken. Data sources Searches were conducted in databases for English language studies between January 2000?December 2018. Review methods The search adhered to the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using Joanna Briggs critical appraisal instruments. The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE. Results Sixteen studies were identified. Findings suggest haemolysis rates are higher in blood sampled from peripheral intravenous cannula. However, haemolysis rates may be lower if a peripheral intravenous cannula blood sampling protocol is followed. For equivalence of blood test results, even though some results were outside the laboratory, allowable error and were outside the Bland?Altman Level of Agreement, none of these values would have required clinical intervention. With regard to the contamination rates of blood cultures, the results were equivocal. Conclusion Further research is required to inform the evidence for best practice recommendations, including, if a protocol for drawing blood from a peripheral cannula is of benefit for specific patient populations and in other settings. Impact Venepuncture can provoke pain, anxiety and cause trauma to patients. Guidelines recommend blood samples from peripheral intravenous cannula be taken only on insertion. Anecdotal evidence suggests drawing blood from existing cannulas may be a common practice. Further research is required to resolve this issue.

AB  - Summary Over the past decades, chromosomal alterations have been extensively investigated for their pathophysiological relevance in haematological malignancies. In particular, epigenetic modifications of intra-nuclear histones are now known as key regulators of healthy cell cycles that have also evolved into novel therapeutic targets for certain blood cancers. Thus, for most haematologists, histones are DNA-chained proteins that are buried deep within chromatin. However, the plot has deepened with recent revelations on the function of histones when unchained and released extracellularly upon cell death or from activated neutrophils as part of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Extracellular histones and NETs are increasingly recognized for profound cytotoxicity and pro-coagulant effects. This article highlights the importance of recognizing this new paradigm of extracellular histones as a key player in host defence through its damage-associated molecular patterns, which could translate into novel diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers in various haematological and critical disorders.

AB  - Abstract The European Society of Endodontology and the American Association for Endodontists have released position statements and clinical considerations for regenerative endodontics. There is increasing literature on this field since the initial reports of Iwaya et al. (Dental Traumatology, 17, 2001, 185) and Banchs  (i) resolution of clinical signs and symptoms; (ii) further root maturation; and (iii) return of neurogenesis. It is known that results are variable for these objectives, and true regeneration of the pulp/dentine complex is not achieved. Repair derived primarily from the periodontal and osseous tissues has been shown histologically. It is hoped that with the concept of tissue engineering, namely stem cells, scaffolds and signalling molecules, that true pulp regeneration is an achievable goal. This review discusses current knowledge as well as future directions for regenerative endodontics. Patient-centred outcomes such as tooth discolouration and possibly more appointments with the potential for adverse effects needs to be discussed with patients and parents. Based on the classification of Cvek (Endodontics and Dental Traumatology, 8, 1992, 45), it is proposed that regenerative endodontics should be considered for teeth with incomplete root formation although teeth with near or complete root formation may be more suited for conventional endodontic therapy or MTA barrier techniques. However, much is still not known about clinical and biological aspects of regenerative endodontics.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) have been found to prolong survival in selected patients with peritoneal disease, but the extent of cytoreduction and chemoperfusion can result in systemic toxicities. We evaluate the incidence of perioperative hematological complications and its associated risk factors. Methods Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database of CRS-HIPEC cases between April 2001 and October 2016 was performed. Patients were stratified based on the clinicopathological characteristics, perioperative incidence, grade, and duration of leukopenia (white blood cells < 4000/mm3), neutropenia (absolute neutrophils < 2000/mm3), and thrombocytopenia (platelets < 140 000/mm3). Results Two hundred and thirty-five CRS-HIPEC were performed in 220 patients with peritoneal metastasis of colorectal, ovarian, primary peritoneal, appendiceal, or mesothelioma origins. The incidences of leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were 15.3%, 3.8%, and 37.9%, respectively. Median time to onset was 1 day (0-16 days), 0 day (0-2 days), and 1 day (1-2 days), respectively, after operation. Median duration of leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia was 1 day (1-3 days), 1 day (1-2days), and 3 days (range 0-16 days), respectively. Age > 60 (odds ratio [OR] 0.229 [95% CI: 0.105-0.502], P < .001) and the use of prior chemotherapy (OR 2.46 [95% CI: 1.24, 4.83], P = .010) were independent risk factors for thrombocytopenia on multivariable logistic regression. Conclusion Hematological toxicities are common after hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy with thrombocytopenia being most common. Patients with age > 60, and who have undergone chemotherapy, are at risk of these toxicities and should be closely monitored post CRS-HIPEC.

AB  - Background: How tissue patterns form in development and regeneration is a fundamental issue remaining to be fully understood. The integument often forms repetitive units in space (periodic patterning) and time (cyclic renewal), such as feathers and hairs. Integument patterns are visible and experimentally manipulatable, helping us reveal pattern formative processes. Variability is seen in regional phenotypic specificities and temporal cycling at different physiological stages. Results: Here we show some cellular/molecular bases revealed by analyzing integument patterns. (1) Localized cellular activity (proliferation, rearrangement, apoptosis, differentiation) transforms prototypic organ primordia into specific shapes. Combinatorial positioning of different localized activity zones generates diverse and complex organ forms. (2) Competitive equilibrium between activators and inhibitors regulates stem cells through cyclic quiescence and activation. Conclusions: Dynamic interactions between stem cells and their adjacent niche regulate regenerative behavior, modulated by multi-layers of macro-environmental factors (dermis, body hormone status, and external environment). Genomics studies may reveal how positional information of localized cellular activity is stored. In vivo skin imaging and lineage tracing unveils new insights into stem cell plasticity. Principles of self-assembly obtained from the integumentary organ model can be applied to help restore damaged patterns during regenerative wound healing and for tissue engineering to rebuild tissues.

AB  - OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to identify distinguishing characteristics between dogs diagnosed with amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia and those diagnosed with presumed primary peripheral immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. Presenting clinical and clinicopathologic data and outcomes were compared between the two groups. METHODS Retrospective study performed on seven client-owned dogs diagnosed with amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia and 34 client-owned dogs with primary peripheral immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. RESULTS All dogs in the amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia group were anaemic on presentation with a median haematocrit of 23% (range 9·4 to 36), while the primary peripheral immune-mediated thrombocytopoenia group had a median presenting haematocrit of 35% (range 10 to 53). Dogs with amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia had a median of five (range 4 to 7) clinical signs of bleeding compared to a median of three (range 0 to 6) in the primary peripheral immune-mediated thrombocytopenia group with 86% (6 of 7) of amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia dogs requiring a blood transfusion compared to 41% (14 of 34) of primary peripheral immune-mediated thrombocytopenia dogs. Six of the seven amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia dogs did not survive to discharge, while only five of the 34 primary peripheral immune-mediated thrombocytopenia dogs did not survive to discharge. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The clinical presentation of dogs with amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia and primary peripheral immune-mediated thrombocytopenia is similar, but dogs with amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia had a more severe clinical course compared to primary peripheral immune-mediated thrombocytopenia dogs. The prognosis for dogs with amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia is poor.

AB  - Summary The prevalence of underlying renal disease in pregnancy is estimated to be as high as 3%. Adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes including preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, and perinatal death are increased. Although data are limited, current evidence indicates that pre-pregnancy or early pregnancy serum creatinine is the best predictor of pregnancy outcomes. Outcomes are progressively worse with higher stages of chronic kidney disease. A multi-disciplinary team approach is recommended to optimize the well-being of both patients: the mother and her fetus. Pregnancies complicated by dialysis and renal transplant warrant special considerations. Effective contraception and evidence-based preconception counseling are important.

AB  - Abstract Objective The association between ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism and the occurrence and development of intracranial arachnoid cyst was studied in this paper. Methods Eighty-five patients diagnosed with intracranial arachnoid cysts by cerebral computed tomography scan were selected. Sixty-three healthy volunteers for medical examination in hospitals served as controls. The cognition, depressive symptoms, and the likelihood of headache, dizziness, head trauma history, dementia, depression, and epilepsy were assessed. ELP4 genotypes and its allele frequency were determined by PCR, endonuclease restriction analysis, and gel electrophoresis. Results ELP4 rs986527 had three genotypes: TT, TC, and CC. The intracranial arachnoid cyst group showed no statistically significant difference in genotype frequencies compared with healthy controls. There was no significant correlation between ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism and location of intracranial arachnoid cyst. TC and C genotype frequencies were associated with a higher incidence of clinical symptoms than TT genotype frequencies, and C allele frequencies were associated with a significantly higher incidence of clinical symptoms compared with T allele frequencies. There was no significant difference in TNF-α and IL-1? levels between TT/TC/CC genotypes before treatment. After treatment, the levels of TNF-α and IL-1? were significantly decreased in different genotypes, and the decrease in CC was the greatest. The frequency of TT and TC genotypes was higher than that of CC genotypes. Conclusion ELP4 rs986527 polymorphism affected the incidence of clinical symptoms and the levels of TNF-α and IL-1? in patients with intracranial arachnoid cysts.

AB  - Abstract In 1990 there were approximately 710 million catheter units produced world-wide from a variety of materials. This number is expected to increase 5?7% in 1991. Intravenous catheters are currently being produced from a myriad of materials including polyurethanes, polyvinylchloride, silicone rubber, and Teflon?, to name a few. Along with the ultimate end usage of a catheter, many other performance characteristics must be evaluated. Some of these characteristics are mechanical and physical properties, surface properties, hemocompatibility, biostability, and processability. The Vialon? biomaterial has a tensile strength of 520 kg/cm2 which is over 50% higher than the other materials studied. This bioengineered material, which is a member of the broad class of polyurethanes, also gave better hemocompatibility properties, as measured by in vivo platelet deposition. In addition Vialon? is engineered such that the material softens in the body's moisture and heat rendering it biocompatible. The thermoplastic nature of this polymer also allows its ease of processing by such conventional means as thermal extrusion. A comparison of the aforementioned materials against these and other performance criteria was undertaken and will be presented.

AB  - Mucinous metaplasia occurs uncommonly in cutaneous pathology, usually at specialized anatomic locations (genitalia, palms, soles) and within restricted pathologic contexts (inflammation, trauma). Here we report a unique case of eccrine mucinous metaplasia associated with an apocrine cystadenoma. A 13-year-old girl had an asymptomatic, 4-mm nodule on the chest. Histopathology demonstrated a typical apocrine cystadenoma in the upper and middle dermis. Adjacent to this neoplasm was a cluster of coiled eccrine secretory ducts, of which the inner layer was almost entirely replaced by benign-appearing cells containing abundant, non-sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides. At eight months? follow-up, there was no recurrence. Our case demonstrates that, very uncommonly, mucinous metaplasia may be associated with a pathogenetically separate, adjacent neoplasm, in this instance an apocrine cystadenoma.
