AB  - Abstract Skeletal muscle regeneration is a complex process, which is not yet completely understood. Satellite cells, the skeletal muscle stem cells, become activated after trauma, proliferate, and migrate to the site of injury. Depending on the severity of the myotrauma, activated satellite cells form new multinucleated myofibers or fuse to damaged myofibers. The specific microenvironment of the satellite cells, the niche, controls their behavior. The niche contains several components that maintain satellite cells quiescence until they are activated. In addition, a great diversity of stimulatory and inhibitory growth factors such as IGF-1 and TGF-?1 regulate their activity. Donor-derived satellite cells are able to improve muscle regeneration, but their migration through the muscle tissue and across endothelial layers is limited. Less than 1% of their progeny, the myoblasts, survive the first days upon intra-muscular injection. However, a range of other multipotent muscle- and non-muscle-derived stem cells are involved in skeletal muscle regeneration. These stem cells can occupy the satellite cell niche and show great potential for the treatment of skeletal muscle injuries and diseases. The aim of this review is to discuss the niche factors, growth factors, and other stem cells, which are involved in skeletal muscle regeneration. Knowledge about the factors regulating satellite cell activity and skeletal muscle regeneration can be used to improve the treatment of muscle injuries and diseases. J. Cell.

AB  - Ticks are ectoparasites that cause dermatologic disease both directly through physical trauma to the skin, salivary secretions, or remnant body parts, and indirectly through transmission of disease. Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, and babesiosis are known tick-transmitted diseases. The histopathology related to a primary tick bite, similar to other arthropod bites, classically consists of a perivascular infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils, histiocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils in varying amounts. We describe five patients with a novel histologic reaction to embedded tick parts., Each case demonstrates a thrombotic vasculopathy consisting of intraluminal eosinophilic deposits that stain strongly with Periodic acid Schiff stain. The adjacent tissue shows dermal necrosis with surrounding interstitial to diffuse dermal neutrophilic inflammation. We postulate that diffuse dermal nutrophilic infiltrates in association with thrombogenic vasculopathy is an unusual histologic picture of tick bite reactions that may be attributable to remnant tick parts.

AB  - Aims 1 To re-evaluate the basic anatomy of the lymphatic vessel network in the head and neck region for diagnosis and treatment of lymphogenic cancer metastases. 2 To compare the anatomy of the lymphatic system with the venous system. 3 To investigate the possibility that extensive lymphatic-venous connections exist. Materials and Methods? The lymphatic vessels in the scalp, face and neck of 5 (ten halves) fresh human cadavers were identified by using 6% hydrogen peroxide with and without India ink, then injecting the vessels with a lead oxide, milk powder and water mixture. The specimens were photographed, radiographed and analyzed. Results? Radiographs and photographs show: 1 The lymphatic pathway ?patterns? found were different in each specimen, even each side of the same head showed considerable variation. 2 The lymphatic pathways of the anterior neck lie in the tissue above the platysma and course horizontally and obliquely. This finding confirm those found using lymphoscintigraphy 3 The discovery of lymphatic bypass routes confirms the lymphoscintigraphy findings that lymphatic drainage does not always go directly to the first tier lymph nodes. 4 We were able to compare the anatomical relationship of the lymphatic and venous systems and demonstrate that a lymphatic-venous shunt does exist in the occipital region. Conclusion? This study provides an anatomical picture of the superficial lymphatic system of the head and neck and will aid surgical management in the treatment of trauma, infection, lymphoedema and cancer.

AB  - Abstract To evaluate the effect of donor age on graft and patient outcome after liver transplantation an analysis of a large-scale cohort study was performed at three tertiary referral liver transplant centers. Between April 1990 and June 1994, 772 adults underwent an initial single-organ liver transplantation. The age of the donors averaged 35 years;193 (25%) were 50 or above, the age used to define ?older? donors. Groups were compared for demographic, clinical, and biochemical features. Outcome was measured using results of biochemical tests after transplantation and by graft and patient survival. Compared with younger donors, older donors were more commonly women (59% vs. 33%:P ≤ .001) and died of central nervous system causes (79% vs. 28%) as opposed to trauma (13% vs. 63%:P ≤ .001). The recipients of the two groups of donor livers did not differ in important respects. However, intraoperatively, livers from older donors were more likely to be assessed as either ?poor? or ?fair? as opposed to ?good? (17% vs. 4%:P ≤ .001) by the harvesting surgeon and to have initial ?poor? or ?fair? bile production (29% vs. 18%:P ≤ .001). During the first week postoperatively, the serum aminotransferase and bilirubin levels and prothrombin times were higher in recipients of older than those of younger donor livers. During follow-up, graft survival was less for recipients of older donor livers at 3 months (81% vs.91%:P = .0001) and at 1 (76% vs. 85%:P = .007) and 2 years (71% vs. 80%:P = .005); patient survival showed similar though less marked differences. This association of donor age and poorer graft survival persisted after adjusting for many variables using bivariate and multivariate analyses. Importantly, however, the association with poor graft survival was largely among recipients of older donor livers, the quality of which was assessed as fair or poor by the harvesting surgeon; recipients of older donor livers assessed as good had a retransplant-free survival similar to that of younger donor livers (87% vs. 91% at 3 months). Thus, use of older donor livers, the quality of which are judged to be good by the harvesting surgeon, is not associated with a decrease in patient or graft survival after liver transplantation. differences.

AB  - Introduction? Nasal trauma in childhood is a frequent occurrence. Management of resultant fractures in the paediatric age group presents a unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The immature patient is less likely to be cooperative with examination, and clinical evaluation is difficult owing to facial oedema and lack of rigidity of the nasal bones. Subsequent nasal growth and development must be considered in determining the most appropriate treatment. Closed reduction of nasal fractures is usually undertaken at the Wellington Regional Plastic, Maxillofacial & Burns Unit at Hutt Hospital. Little exists in the form of follow-up studies assessing patient satisfaction following this technique. Methods? A retrospective chart reviewed yielded 39 patients aged under seventeen years who underwent closed reduction of their nasal fracture during the two year period ending in July 2006 at Hutt Hospital. Follow-up was between three and twenty-seven months. A structured telephone interview was carried out to assess the degree of satisfaction with both functional and aesthetic outcome present in this group. Patients and their parents were invited to respond. Results? Most patients and their families are satisfied with nasal function and appearance following closed reduction. Few had subsequently sought or would consider a secondary open procedure in the form of septorhinoplasty. Conclusion? Closed reduction remains a satisfactory treatment in this age group. On the basis of patient satisfaction, it is successful in maintaining the function and appearance of the nose in most.

AB  - Summary This investigation examines the histological and ultrastructural lesions of the colonic mucosa during terminal experimental infarction and subsequent reperfusion. Four ponies were anaesthetised and subjected to surgical torsion of the colon. Biopsies were collected at hourly intervals for 3 h, at which point the torsions were corrected. Circulation was re-established for 2 h and the bowel was re-biopsied at hourly intervals. The ponies were killed while under anaesthesia. During the 3 h experimental infarction, the bowel became macroscopically thickened and dark purple. Histologically, the mucosa degenerated from Grade 0 to Grade 3. Ultrastructurally, there was progressive micro-vascular distension with erythrodiapedesis and damage to the interstitial cells. Spaces developed between the bases and sides of the columnar epithelial cells and sloughing followed subsequently. During the 2 h reperfusion interval, the mucosa continued to degenerate rapidly to a Grade 5, and was characterised by extensive interstitial damage, oedema, cellular swelling, necrosis and mitochondrial damage. The results showed that the experimentally infarcted colonic mucosa degenerated sequentially. Following circulatory reestablishment, continued rapid mucosal degeneration characteristic of reperfusion injury occurred. Reperfusion injury is probably responsible, at least in part, for the often poor outcome of infarcted bowel in horses following surgical correction.

AB  - Summary Background:? Retroperitoneal haematoma is a rare clinical entity with variable aetiology, which is increasing in incidence mainly due to complications related to interventional procedures. There is no general consensus as to the best management plan for patients with retroperitoneal haematoma. Methods:? A literature review was undertaken using MEDLINE, all relevant papers on retroperitoneal haemorrhage or haematoma were used. Results:? The diagnosis is often delayed as symptoms are nonspecific. Retroperitoneal haematoma should be suspected in patients with significant groin, flank, abdominal, back pain or haemodynamic instability following an interventional procedure. Spontaneous haemorrhage usually occurs in patients who are anticoagulated. Multi-slice CT and arteriography are important for diagnosis. Most haemodynamically stable patients can be managed with fluid resuscitation, correction of coagulopathy and blood transfusion. Endovascular treatment involving selective intra-arterial embolisation or the deployment of stent-grafts over the punctured vessel is attaining an increasingly important role. Open repair of retroperitoneal bleeding vessels should be reserved for cases when there is failure of conservative or endovascular measures to control the bleeding. Open repair is also required if endovascular facilities or expertise is unavailable and in cases where the patient is unstable. If treated inappropriately, the mortality of patients with retroperitoneal haematoma remains high. Conclusion:? There is a lack of level I evidence for the best management plans for retroperitoneal haematoma, and evidence is based on small cohort series or isolated case reports. Conservative management should only be reserved for patients who are stable. Interventional radiology with intra-arterial embolisation or stent-grafting is the treatment of choice. Open surgery is now rarely required.

AB  - Summary Thromboelastography (TEG) was first described by Hartert in 1948, and was designed to monitor viscoelastic clot strength in whole blood in real time. The current TEG method and Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) were subsequently developed from the original principles. Both of the modern methods provide data by measuring changes in the viscoelastic strength of a small sample of clotting blood in response to a constant rotational force. The important advantage of these techniques is to visually observe and quantify blood coagulation including the propagation, stabilization and dissolution phases of clot formation under low shear conditions. Analysis of the results provides detailed kinetic data on fibrin generation, clot strength and fibrinolysis. These TEG/ROTEM analyses therefore enable evaluation of global clotting function and the monitoring of haemostatic treatment in various clinical situations, not only in patients with genetic bleeding disorders, such as haemophilia, but also in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, liver transplantation or suffering from traumatic injury. Some evidence suggests that haemostatic management using TEG/ROTEM leads to a reduction in total transfusions of whole blood or clotting factors. Wider clinical application of this technology seems likely.

AB  - Objective This study aimed to explore the association between GPIa, COX-2 gene polymorphisms and aspirin resistance in the ischemic stroke patients from the southern part of Jiangsu province. Methods In all, 97 patients with acute ischemic stroke were enrolled in the study. GPIa gene polymorphism at 807C>T (rsl126643) locus and COX-2 gene polymorphism at -765G>C (rs20417) locus were genotyped by PCR pyrosequencing technology. Patients were divided into the aspirin sensitivity (AS) group and aspirin resistance (AR) group according to the platelet aggregation rate. The relationship between the two gene polymorphisms and aspirin resistance was investigated and analyzed. Results The distribution of the genotype (CC, CT, TT, CT + TT, and CC) and the frequency of allele T of GPIa gene at 807C>T locus were significantly different in AS and AR groups in female patients (P < .05). Logistic regression analysis showed that the genotype of CT+TT at 807C>T locus was significantly correlated with AR after adjustment for relative factors (P = .047, OR = 4.856, 95% CI: 1.020?23.108). There were no significant differences in the genotype distribution and allele frequency of the COX-2 gene -765G>C site between two groups (P > .05). Conclusion GPIa gene polymorphism at 807C>T locus was associated with AR in Chinese Han females, and the expression of allele T increased the incidence of AR. The gene polymorphism of COX-2 gene at -765G>C locus was not significantly correlated with AR.

AB  - Open heart surgery was performed during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to surgically correct subvalvular aortic stenosis in seven dogs. After initiation of total CPB, cardiac arrest was induced by antegrade and retrograde administration of blood cardioplegia. The subvalvular fibrous stenosis was resected through a transverse aortotomy. Intraoperatively and postop-eratively, dobutamine, nitroprusside, lidocaine, blood(-products), and crystalloid solutions were used to manage hypotension and optimize cardiac index. Aortic cross-clamp time varied from 73 to 166 minutes, and duration of CPB varied from 130 to 210 minutes, latrogenic incision into the mitral valve in two dogs was the most significant introperative complication. Postoperative complications included: hypoproteinemia (n = 7), premature ventricular depolarization (n = 6), increased systemic vascular resistance index (n = 5), increased O2 extraction (n = 3), pulmonary edema (n = 2), and decreased cardiac index (n = 1). All seven dogs were discharged alive and in stable condition. Six dogs are alive and in stable condition after a mean follow up of 15.8 months. This is the first detailed report of CPB in a series of clinical veterinary patients. Using the techniques described in this paper, open heart surgery of considerable duration can be performed successfully in dogs with significant myocardial hypertrophy and endomyocardial fibrosis secondary to subvalvular aortic stenosis.

AB  - For at least 30 years it has been well known that very small electric currents applied to various kinds of trauma have a beneficial therapeutic result for wounds. The most effective methods so far utilized some form of direct current, by inserting an electric lead on each side of the wound and passing a weak electric current across the wound. The drawback of this method is invasive. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a noninvasive electric magnetic field device, Field Therapy Accelerator or FTA (Advatech Corp.), on cell migration of human skin keratinocytes in an in vitro incitional wound model. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes were maintained in growth media and grow into confluent. At time 0, a cross-shaped wound gap or cell-free zone was made among confluent monolayer cells in the center of the culture dish. Cells were treated with FTA for 1 hour immediately after wounding and 1 hour every 24 hours for a total of 4 hours in 4 days. The cell cultures were examined at time 0 and every 24 hours thereafter. A Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope with a digital camera system was used to capture the images and an AxioVision 3.0 image analysis software was used to measure the gap area. Cell migration was quantified by the time and percentage of the wound gap covered by the cells that migrated in and filled the gap. The results showed that the FTA treatment significantly accelerates skin keratinocyte migration. The wound gaps completely filled 6 days after wounding, 3 days earlier than control (no treatment) group (P?<?0.001). Cell migration is a key step leading to the reepithelialization or the restoration of skin structure. This study showed the strong effects of FTA on keratinocyte migration, suggesting one of mechanisms that electric magnetic field works on wound healing.

AB  - Abstract Sorafenib is the first multi-kinase inhibitor (TKI) approved for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular cancer (HCC) and metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC) and is increasingly being used to treat patients with well-differentiated radioiodine-resistant thyroid cancer (DTC). Sorafenib demonstrates targeted activity on several families of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases that are involved in angiogenesis, tumour growth and metastatic progression of cancer. Sorafenib treatment results in long-term efficacy and low incidence of life-threatening toxicities. Although sorafenib has demonstrated many benefits in patients, the adverse effects cannot be ignored. The most common treatment-related toxicities include diarrhoea, fatigue, hand?foot skin reaction and hypertension. Most of these toxicities are considered mild to moderate and manageable to varying degrees; however, cardiovascular events might lead to death. In this MiniReview, we summarize the adverse effects of sorafenib that commonly occur in patients with advanced cancers.

AB  - Summary In adults diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), challenges remain in the management of the acute event whilst remaining alert to long-term morbidity. The addition of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) to the pharmacopoeia represents the first of a number of recent advancements in the management of DVT. Worldwide, uptake of these agents has been avid, although drug selection, reversal and chronic treatment effects continue to be controversial areas. Multi-centre studies to evaluate the impact of NOACs on long-term outcomes, including thrombosis recurrence and post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), are ongoing. Validation of tools capable of predicting PTS would enable patient selection for early aggressive intervention, such as local thrombolysis. Such interventional strategies are gaining momentum as initial approaches and would benefit from large randomized controlled trials.

AB  - Summary Multi-factorial causes jeopardize brain integrity in ?-thalassaemia. Intracranial parenchymal and vascular changes have been reported among young ?-thalassaemia patients but conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are contradictory making early MRI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)/venography monitoring a matter of debate. This study prospectively investigated 75 neurologically asymptomatic ?-thalassaemia patients (mean-age 35·2 ± 10·7 years; 52/75 transfusion-dependent; 41/75 splenectomised) using a 3T magnetic resonance scanner; clinical, laboratory and treatment data were also collected. White matter ischaemic-like abnormalities, intracranial artery stenoses, aneurysms and sinus venous thrombosis were compared between patients and 56 healthy controls (mean-age 33·9 ± 10·8 years). No patient or control showed silent territorial or lacunar strokes, intracranial artery stenoses or signs of sinus thrombosis. White matter lesions were found both in patients (35/75, 46·7%) and controls (28/56, 50·0%), without differences in terms of number (4·0 ± 10·6 vs. 4·6 ± 9·1, P = 0·63), size and Fazekas? Score. Intracranial aneurysms did not differ between patients and controls for incidence rate (7/75, 9·3% vs. 5/56, 8·9%), size and site. Vascular and parenchymal abnormality rate did not differ according to treatments or clinical phenotype. According to this study, asymptomatic ?-thalassaemia patients treated according to current guidelines do not seem to carry an increased risk of brain and intracranial vascular changes, thus weakening recommendations for regular brain MRI monitoring.

AB  - Abstract Clinical Development Phases I-III Regulatory, Quality, Manufacturing Thrombosis as a clinical phenotype is ubiquitous in human diseases and conditions, ranging from atherosclerosis and other vascular disorders to trauma, surgery, malignancy, infections, blood dyscrasias, auto-immunity, and complications of pregnancy. While each condition carries its own distinct signature and predisposition for thrombosis as a nonphysiological event, there are several common themes that center on cellular and noncellular elements, including well-characterized coagulation proteases. Over the past decade, our group has been actively involved with the development of a factor IXa inhibitor, pegnivacogin, and its complementary antidote or control agent, anivamersen. The following review provides a summary of fundamental constructs, milestones, and the current status of our translational journey.

AB  - SUMMARY Over a 5-year period (1988?92), von Willebrand factor antigen (vWf:Ag) concentrations were determined on plasma samples from 614 Dobermanns. The vWf:Ag concentration was < 50 canine units (CU)/dL in 373 dogs (61%); these dogs were classified as carriers of the von Willebrand's disease (vWD) gene. In order to identify which dogs were at risk of haemorrhage due to vWD, we determined a cut-off vWf:Ag concentration below which dogs could be considered at risk. This cut-off was chosen in order to minimise the number of dogs genuinely at risk of haemorrhage, being wrongly classified as not at risk. This was done without sacrificing the specificity of the cut-off to any great extent. A vWf:Ag concentration of < 36 CU/dL was empirically chosen as the optimum cut-off concentration. In 282 dogs (76% of the carriers), the vWf:Ag concentration was below this cut-off and these dogs were, thus, classified as being at risk of haemorrhage due to vWD. Haemorrhage attributable to vWD was seen in 107 dogs (29% of the carriers, or 17% of all the dogs). Haemorrhage mostly followed trauma or surgery, but spontaneous genitourinary and gastrointestinal haemorrhages were also frequent. Of these dogs, 92 were of known age, with a median of 3 years, and 102 were of known sex, with 61% being female. In 89 dogs in which the severity of haemorrhage was subjectively assessed, mild and moderate bleeding occurred with similar frequency (48% and 43%, respectively). There were 8 cases of severe haemorrhage, with two deaths. The likelihood of haemorrhage was related to the vWf:Ag concentration: only 8% of 91 dogs with concentrations between 36 and 49 CU/dL had haemorrhage attributable to vWD, but 36% with concentrations < 36 CU/dL did so. Furthermore, dogs with haemorrhage attributable to vWD had significantly (P < 0.001) lower vWf:Ag concentrations (median 12 CU/dL, n = 107) than dogs with no such history (median 30 CU/dL, n = 132). The data indicate that vWD is a significant problem in the Dobermann breed in Australia and we accordingly recommend that steps be taken to reduce its prevalence, such as the establishment of a national testing scheme to determine the vWD status of all dogs used for breeding.

AB  - Hospital acquired infections (HAI) are a major source of morbidity and mortality in human and veterinary hospitals. Research in human hospitals has shown that well focused staff education is an important step in limiting the development of HAI. Our hospital currently has no training program with respect to HAI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the general knowledge of hospital staff concerning HAI as the first step in developing a hospital wide education program. Ninety doctors and technicians were given a questionnaire containing 15 questions about HAI. The questionnaires were hand distributed and immediately completed. Ten of the questions tested knowledge of HAI, while five questions concerned the individual's perception of HAI in our hospital. Answers were given as a range from strongly agree to strongly disagree or in the form of multiple choice. With respect to their perception of HAI, 66% of technicians and 50% of doctors believed that they possess a good working knowledge of HAI. Several areas for improvement in hospital staff knowledge were identified. Technicians were more likely than doctors to incorrectly believe that 1) routine environmental cultures are effective at preventing HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 30%, doctors 52%), 2) that all animals that aspirated gastric contents under anesthesia develop clinical evidence of pneumonia (percent correct answer: technicians 55%, doctors 84%), and 3) that animals with an indwelling urinary catheter should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics (percent correct answer: technicians 51%, doctors 90%). In addition, doctors were more likely to identify Amikacin as the antibiotic of choice for patients with HAI in our hospital (percent correct answer: technicians 27%, doctors 79%). Neither group was able to adequately identify the patients in the ICU as the primary reservoir for the multi-drug resistant pathogens that cause HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 20%, doctors 15%). The discrepancy in knowledge between the two groups is likely explained by attendance of faculty, residents, and interns at one or more continuing education rounds sessions where HAI were discussed. This finding is contrary to what is frequently found in human hospitals where the nursing staff typically demonstrates superior knowledge of HAI when compared to doctors. The results of this study demonstrate that knowledge of HAI is not optimal in both the doctors and technicians in our hospital. Further better focused efforts are warranted to address the educational shortcomings evidenced by this study.

AB  - Abstract Background Rat bite fever is a zoonotic disease that has been described in laboratory personnel as well as the general population. Methods A 24-year-old male pet shop employee contracted the disease through a minor superficial finger wound on a contaminated rat cage. The disease progressed from a flu-like illness to endocarditis involving first the aortic valve and then the mitral valve and septum. Despite aggressive therapy including two surgical procedures, the patient died from sepsis and multi-organ system failure 59 days after initial injury. Results This is the first reported case of rat-bite fever (RBF) in a pet shop work setting. Conclusions Zoonotic infections may present a significant hazard to workers handling animals. Education on hazards of animal contact and other preventive measures are needed in small places of business like pet shops. Am. J. Ind. Med. 45:357?360, 2004. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
