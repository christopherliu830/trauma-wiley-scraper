AB  - Abstract Angiogenesis is essential for normal bone formation and repair. Avascularity characterizes aberrant fracture union in the elderly, while angiogenic mechanisms during cutaneous wound repair are attenuated in aged humans. We hypothesized that skeletal injury results in local (circulating) and systemic (fracture site) ?angiogenic? responses and that these reparative mechanisms are attenuated with advanced patient age. This prospective study examined peripheral blood and fracture hematoma from 32 patients, 16 under 40 years and 16 over the age of 75, undergoing emergent surgery for isolated fracture. The angiogenic cytokines vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) were assayed. Endothelial cell cultures were supplemented with patient plasma and fracture hematoma and angiogenesis determined in vitro by measuring cell proliferation and blood vessel tube formation. Angiogenesis was determined in vivo using a murine dorsal wound pocket model and quantification of new blood vessel formation after 7 days. We found that all injured patients, irrespective of age, have elevated plasma and fracture hematoma levels of VEGF and PDGF. These elevated cytokine concentrations translate into biologically significant angiogenic effects, in vitro and in vivo. These effects are primarily VEGF mediated and are not dependent on patient age. The biological activity of these growth factors does not diminish with advanced age. Thus skeletal injury does result in local and systemic angiogenic responses whereby angiogenic cytokine availability and activity is preserved in the aged suggesting alternative mechanisms for the development of avascularity in delayed and fracture non-union in the elderly. ? 2001 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients may have various forms of angioedema and require dental treatment which can cause or contribute to the onset of an episode of angioedema. This paper seeks to highlight the causes and the management of this serious condition. DESIGN: An outline of the different types of angioedema is given here, along with three case reports which illustrate treatment and management. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Three patients who presented to an Oral Medicine clinic with angioedema are presented to illustrate various types of angioedema and the different contributing factors that precipitated episodes of the condition. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The three patients were all investigated for biochemical and allergic factors which may have caused their disease. RESULTS: Both drugs and dental materials were shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of angioedema in this short series of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Dental treatment or the use of some materials may promote or contribute to the disorder. Referral to hospital for specialist care is indicated for certain groups of patients who require invasive dental treatment. The multi-disciplinary team approach in the investigation and management of patients with angioedema is emphasised.

AB  - Sepsis with multi organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is the most common cause of death in patients in noncoronary intensive care units. Currently, there are no specific treatments that reduce mortality in patients with sepsis and MODS. We report three patients who received therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) for sepsis with MODS who completely recovered. The first patient, a 3-year-old male presented with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-associated respiratory, renal, coagulation, hepatic, and neurologic dysfunction. After 5 TPEs, the patient fully recovered. The second patient was a 36-year-old pregnant female who developed MODS at 22 weeks of gestation. She had developed respiratory, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, neurologic, and coagulation dysfunction following pneumonia and concurrent urinary tract infection resulting in an intrauterine fetal demise. After 8 TPEs, the patient was discharged home with only mild residual hepatic dysfunction. The third patient, a 50-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, was found unresponsive in over 100°F heat and diagnosed with Staphylococcus aureus-associated MODS. Her respiratory, coagulation, neurologic, renal, and hepatic systems were affected. The patient underwent 6 TPEs after which she had marked improvement. In conclusion, TPE may be an effective adjunct therapy in MODS by possibly removing toxic mediators and replacing deficient factors using donor plasma. J. Clin.

AB  - Abstract We investigated whether there is an association between factor V Leiden (FVL) and/or prothrombin gene G20210A mutation (PT20210A) and cerebral thromboembolism in a pediatric Argentinean population. From May 1992 to January 2002, 44 consecutive children with arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) and 23 children with cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (SVT) were prospectively studied at a single center. The prevalence of both mutations was compared with a 102 age-matched controls. In children with AIS, the frequencies (patients vs. controls), odds ratio (OR), and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the presence of FVL were as follows: 2.3% vs. 2%, OR/95% CI, 1.16/0.2 to 13.2; P value = 0.99. No cases of PT20210A were found in this group. In children with SVT, the frequencies (patients vs. controls), OR, and 95% CI were as follows: FVL (4.3% vs. 2%, OR/95% CI, 2.27/0.22 to 6.2; P value = 0.99) and PT20210A (4.3% vs. 1%; OR/95% CI, 4.6/0.3 to 76.3; P value = 0.3354). One child with PT20210A also had an inherited protein C deficiency. In 12 (18%) out of the 67 children with cerebral thromboembolism, without the aforementioned mutations, other prothrombotic disorders were detected. Although a multi-center prospective study with a large number of Argentinean pediatric patients is needed to obtain considerable evidence, no association between factor V Leiden and/or prothrombin gene G20210A mutation and cerebral thromboembolism was found in this pediatric series.

AB  - Background and Objectives? Transfusion of autologous whole blood is one available method to reduce the need for allogenic blood transfusion. The objective of this study was to investigate the safety of transfusion of intra-operative autologous whole blood by monitoring plasma concentration of laboratory variables and adverse events after transfusion with the Sangvia? system. Materials and Methods? The clinical trial was designed as an open, prospective, multi-centre study, and a total of 20 patients undergoing primary hip arthroplasty were included. Systemic blood samples were taken and analysed preoperatively, at transfusion start and end and at 3, 6, 24 and 48?h after the transfusion. Results? Elevated values of complement activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines were seen in the intra-operatively collected blood but the impact on systemic levels were limited with low peak levels, systemic elevations before transfusion and normalization during the study period. Elevated levels of free haemoglobin and potassium were also detected in the intra-operatively collected blood, but systemic values were within reference values after the transfusion. No clinically relevant adverse event occurred during the study. Conclusion? Inflammatory mediators and plasma haemoglobin were increased in intra-operatively salvaged and filtered blood compared to circulatory levels. Intra-operative retransfusion of autologous whole blood caused a transient systemic increase that normalized in the early postoperative period. There were no significant adverse events reported in the study. These data suggest that the Sangvia? system can be used for intra-operative collection and retransfusion of salvaged blood.

AB  - A cat receiving chemotherapy for lymphoma was administered a four times overdose of vinblastine in error. Severe, acute life-threatening toxicities occurred. The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) was suspected based on electrolyte disturbances. A favourable outcome was achieved with aggressive supportive care. Personnel involved in administering chemotherapy to small animal patients must check that the patient is receiving the correct drug, at the appropriate dose, prior to every treatment.

AB  - Summary There are several differences in treatment of neonatal foals with antimicrobials, compared to mature horses. Firstly, the dose of many antimicrobials is different in the foal. For orally administered drugs, this may also affect their efficacy, due to different enteral absorption. Secondly, neonatal foals are not yet hindgut fermentors and this allows antimicrobials with a high propensity to cause colitis in mature horses to be used. Thirdly, toxicities are different and some antimicrobials used in mature horses, such as enrofloxacin, are not suitable for use in foals. Foal-specific information is therefore needed for their safe and effective treatment with antimicrobials.

AB  - Summary Mental illness exerts a major burden on human health, yet evidence-based treatments are rudimentary due to a limited understanding of the underlying pathologies. Clinical studies point to roles for the immune system in psychiatric diseases, while basic science has revealed that the brain has an active and multi-cellular resident immune system that interacts with peripheral immunity and impacts behavior. In this perspective, we highlight evidence of immune involvement in human psychiatric disease and review data from animal models that link immune signaling to neuronal function and behavior. We propose a conceptual framework for linking advances in basic neuroimmunology to their potential relevance for psychiatric diseases, based on the subtypes of immune responses defined in peripheral tissues. Our goal is to identify novel areas of focus for future basic and translational studies that may reveal the potential of the immune system for diagnosing and treating mental illnesses

AB  - Abstract Objective? To determine the effects of intravenous (IV) magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) as a bolus followed by a constant rate infusion (CRI) on anaesthetic requirements, neuroendocrine stress response to surgery, haemostasis and postoperative analgesia in healthy dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Study design? Blinded randomized clinical trial. Animals? Sixteen female dogs. Methods? After intramuscular premedication with acepromazine (0.05?mg?kg?1) and morphine (0.3?mg?kg?1), anaesthesia was induced with diazepam (0.2?mg?kg?1) and propofol (2?mg?kg?1) intravenously and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen in all dogs. Dogs were randomly assigned to two groups, M and C. Group M received MgSO4 (50?mg?kg?1 over 15?minutes, followed by a 15?mg?kg?1?hour?1 CRI). Group C received an equivalent bolus and CRI of lactated Ringer?s solution. In addition, all dogs received lactated Ringer?s solution (10?mL?kg?1 over 15?minutes followed by 10?mL?kg?1?hour?1). End-tidal isoflurane and carbon dioxide tensions, cardio-respiratory variables, arterial blood gases, electrolytes, ACTH and cortisol concentrations were measured at different time points. Thromboelastography (TEG) was performed pre- and post-anaesthesia. Postoperative pain was evaluated using the short form of the Glasgow Composite Pain Scale. Data were analysed with repeated measures anova and Mann?Whitney U tests (p?<?0.05). Results? No statistically significant differences between groups were found in any of the measured variables. However, the alpha angle and maximal amplitude recorded by TEG in group M were significantly increased post-anaesthesia, but remained within the reference interval. One dog in Group M and two in Group C received rescue analgesia during recovery. Conclusions and clinical relevance? As used in this study, MgSO4 failed to decrease isoflurane requirements, postoperative pain and stress hormone concentrations; however, it did not produce any cardio-respiratory or major haemostatic side effects. Administration of intravenous MgSO4 together with an opioid during ovariohysterectomy in dogs does not seem to provide any clinical advantage.

AB  - Abstract Colchicine overdose is uncommon but frequently fatal. In this article we present two cases which exhibit the wide spectrum of colchicine toxicity and review the drug's pharmacology and organ system effects. Finally we provide a treatment algorithm and propose new directions for management. Colchicine binds to intracellular tubulin and prevents its polymerisation to form microtubules. As microtubules subserve a wide variety of roles in basic cellular function including protein assembly, mitosis, endocytosis, exocytosis, cell shape and motility, colchicine is profoundly toxic to all cell lines of the body. Previous studies have offered little to aid the clinician in the management of such patients. We present a series of treatment guidelines based on the current literature. Specifically, we propose that patients who do not develop gastrointestinal symptoms within eight hours of a small, isolated colchicine ingestion can be medically cleared. Additionally, the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms should be seen as an indicator of possible significant systemic toxicity requiring early resuscitation and intensive monitoring. The newer modalities of treatment including the use of colchicine-specific Fab fragments and Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor are also addressed.

AB  - Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a multi-factorial antigen-independent inflammatory condition that profoundly affects both early and long-term function of the allograft as suggested by both clinical and experimental data. In recent years, the acute phase of IRI has been increasingly viewed as part of the innate immune response. Identification of novel molecular pathways and new insights into the mechanisms of known mediators of IRI have established links among innate immunity, adaptive immune responses and organ regeneration, and thus long-term graft function. This review approaches these novel aspects of IRI in the context of solid organ transplantation, presenting data on new observations with kidney, liver and heart allografts.

AB  - ABSTRACT A retrospective study of 27 dogs with deep mycoses was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of initial laboratory results in determining a diagnosis. Fifteen cases of disseminated blastomycosis, five cases of disseminated histoplasmosis and seven cases of gastrointestinal phycomycosis were studied. Haematologic results consistent with a chronic inflammatory disease (mild to moderate anaemia and moderate to marked monocytosis) were common findings in blastomycosis and phycomycosis. Cases of histoplasmosis were characterized by a more severe anaemia with a neutrophilia and left shift. The severe anaemia present in three out of five (3/5) dogs with histoplasmosis was apparently due to myelophthisis and intravascular erythrocyte fragmentation. Coagulation function tests and/or the haemograms suggested the presence of microangiopathic haemolysis in four dogs with histoplasmosis. Clinical chemistry results in blastomycosis and phycomycosis were usually unremarkable. Hepatic lesions in histoplasmosis were suggested by increases in serum alkaline phosphatase and decreases in serum albumin. Cytology was frequently diagnostic for blastomycosis (11/13 cases) and histoplasmosis (3/4 cases) but was inconsistent in phycomycosis (1/3 cases).

AB  - Abstract The endothelial barrier consists of intercellular contacts localized in the cleft between endothelial cells, which is covered by the glycocalyx in a sievelike manner. Both types of barrier-forming junctions, i.e. the adherens junction (AJ) serving mechanical anchorage and mechanotransduction and the tight junction (TJ) sealing the intercellular space to limit paracellular permeability, are tethered to the actin cytoskeleton. Under resting conditions, the endothelium thereby builds a selective layer controlling the exchange of fluid and solutes with the surrounding tissue. However, in the situation of an inflammatory response such as in anaphylaxis or sepsis intercellular contacts disintegrate in post-capillary venules leading to intercellular gap formation. The resulting oedema can cause shock and multi-organ failure. Therefore, maintenance as well as coordinated opening and closure of interendothelial junctions is tightly regulated. The two principle underlying mechanisms comprise spatiotemporal activity control of the small GTPases Rac1 and RhoA and the balance of the phosphorylation state of AJ proteins. In the resting state, junctional Rac1 and RhoA activity is enhanced by junctional components, actin-binding proteins, cAMP signalling and extracellular cues such as sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1). In addition, phosphorylation of AJ components is prevented by junction-associated phosphatases including vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP). In contrast, inflammatory mediators inhibiting cAMP/Rac1 signalling cause strong activation of RhoA and induce AJ phosphorylation finally leading to endocytosis and cleavage of VE-cadherin. This results in dissolution of TJs the outcome of which is endothelial barrier breakdown.

AB  - Abstract Global temperatures are rising; extreme environmental heat can result in adverse health effects including heatstroke. Acute effects of heat are well recognised, but there is less understanding of potential long-term adverse outcomes. Our aim was to review recent medical literature for clinical cases of environmental heatstroke with a focus on neurological outcome. Structured search strategies were designed to retrieve publications of heatstroke case reports using Ovid Medline and Embase (2000?2016). One thousand and forty-nine abstracts were identified, and after application of exclusion criteria 71 articles deemed relevant. Ninety cases were identified from 71 articles. 100% presented with acute neurological symptoms; 87.8% presented with non-neurological symptoms. 44.4% patients recovered fully, 23.3% died, 23.3% suffered convalescent or long-term neurological sequelae, and in 8.9% no long-term follow up was available. 57.1% of the patients who died or had a neurological deficit had no documented co-morbidity. Patterns of neurological deficits included 66.7% patients with motor dysfunction, 9.5% cognitive impairment, 19% both motor and cognitive impairment and 4.7% other. In total 71.4% of the impaired patients had long-term cerebellar dysfunction. Adverse long-term neurological outcomes were common in surviving patients presenting with environmental heatstroke. Permanent neurological deficits were present in 34.4% of survivors where outcome was known; many were young, healthy individuals. Cerebellar injury was common suggesting cerebellar structures are vulnerable to heat. These findings highlight that people of all ages and pre-morbid states are at risk of severe heat-related illness. In the face of climate change, effective interventions for heat-related illness, including both treatment and prevention are necessary.

AB  - Abstract Previous research has identified potential issues of establishing and maintaining breastfeeding among women who experience severe maternal morbidity associated with pregnancy and birth, but evidence in the UK maternity population was scarce. We explored the association between severe maternal morbidity and breastfeeding outcomes (uptake and prevalence of partial and exclusive breastfeeding) at 6 to 8 weeks post-partum in a UK sample. Data on breastfeeding outcomes were obtained from a large cohort study of women who gave birth in one maternity unit in England to assess the impact of women's experiences of severe maternal morbidity (defined as major obstetric haemorrhage, severe hypertensive disorder or high dependency unit/intensive care unit admission) on their post-natal health and other important outcomes including infant feeding. Results indicated that among women who responded (n?=?1824, response rate?=?53%), there were no statistically significant differences in breastfeeding outcomes between women who did or did not experience severe morbidity, except for women with severe hypertensive disorder who were less likely to breastfeed either partially or exclusively at 6 to 8 weeks post-partum. Rather, breastfeeding outcomes were related to multi-dimensional factors including sociodemographic (age, ethnicity, living arrangement), other pregnancy outcomes (neonatal intensive care unit admission, mode of birth, women's perceived control during birth) and post-natal psychological factors (depressive symptoms). Women who experience severe maternal morbidity can be reassured that establishing successful breastfeeding can be achieved. More studies are required to understand what support is best for women who have complex health/social needs to establish breastfeeding.
