AB  - Abstract. Tritos NA, Weinrib S, Kaye TB (Lahey Hitchcock Clinic, Burlington; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston; and Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA). Endocrine manifestations of Erdheim?Chester disease (a distinct form of histiocytosis) (Case Report). J Intern Med 1998; 244: 529?35. Erdheim?Chester disease (ECD) is a disorder of unclear aetiology, characterized by exuberant histiocyte proliferation and a variable clinical course. We report the case of a woman with multi-organ involvement secondary to ECD. Central diabetes insipidus (CDI), hyperprolactinaemia, gonadotropin insufficiency and decreased insulin-like growth factor I levels were present, suggesting hypothalamic?pituitary dysfunction. The high-intensity signal of the posterior pituitary on T1-weighted images was absent on magnetic resonance imaging, but no sellar mass lesions or stalk thickening were apparent. Additionally, our patient had bilateral adrenal enlargement. Even though ECD is a rare cause of neuroendocrine dysfunction or adrenal enlargement, it should be considered in patients with these disorders in the setting of multiorgan disease.

AB  - ABSTRACT The global burden of disease associated with wounds is an increasingly significant public health concern. Current treatments are often expensive, time-consuming and limited in their efficacy in chronic wounds. The challenge of overcoming current barriers associated with wound care requires innovative management techniques. Regenerative medicine is an emerging field of research that focuses on the repair, replacement or regeneration of cells, tissues or organs to restore impaired function. This article provides an overview of the pathophysiology of wound healing and reviews the latest evidence on the application of the principal components of regenerative medicine (growth factors, stem cell transplantation, biomaterials and tissue engineering) as therapeutic targets. Improved knowledge and understanding of the pathophysiology of wound healing has pointed to new therapeutic targets. Regenerative medicine has the potential to underpin the design of specific target therapies in acute and chronic wound healing. This personalised approach could eventually reduce the burden of disease associated with wound healing. Further evidence is required in the form of large animal studies and clinical trials to assess long-term efficacy and safety of these new treatments.

AB  - Abstract Background The outlook for many brain tumors remains poor. Increased dose intensity has been correlated with response rate and survival in many solid tumors. Patients and Methods Ten children with recurrent or newly diagnosed brain tumors were treated with four sequential courses of high-dose single agent chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) support. PBSC harvesting was undertaken prior to chemotherapy and following the first course of chemotherapy (3.6 g/m2 etoposide). Each course of chemotherapy consisted of a single drug followed 48 hours later by PBSC reinfusion. Three patients were treated on Regimen A: etoposide, carboplatinum 1.95 g/m2, cyclophosphamide 5 g/m2, and thiotepa 300 mg/m2; three patients were treated on Regimen A? with carmustine 600 mg/m2 replacing cyclophosphamide; four patients received Regimen B: etoposide, carboplatinum 1.95g/m2, cyclophosphamide 7 g/m2, and thiotepa 900 mg/m2. Results No course of chemotherapy was complicated by >14 days of neutropenia. Platelet recovery was more prolonged, particularly in patients who had previously received craniospinal irradiation. Non-hematologic toxicity was severe with three toxic deaths including two patients who developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome and respiratory failure. Two of three patients with primitive neuroectodermal tumors had a partial response; no responses were observed in patients with high-grade gliomas. Conclusions Administration of multiple courses of high-dose chemotherapy with PBSC support is feasible in this patient population and successfully mitigates hematologic toxicity. Non-hematologic toxicity becomes prohibitive as chemotherapy doses are escalated. Med. Pediatr. Oncol. 29:553?559, 1997. ? 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding usually presents with haematemesis or melaena, but should be considered in any patient with unexplained hypotension or syncope, or decompensated chronic liver disease. In patients with severe upper GI bleeding, a good outcome requires vigorous resuscitation, and close collaboration with medical, endoscopic, radiological and surgical teams: it is important to involve these specialists as early as possible to discuss the management plan. Urgent endoscopy is needed for patients with shock on admission, with known varices or signs of chronic liver disease, or evidence of continued bleeding. Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy should be stopped/reversed, if the benefits of doing so outweigh the risks: for patients with a mechanical prosthetic heart valve, recent acute coronary syndrome or coronary stents, discuss this with a cardiologist. Patients with low-risk peptic ulcer bleeding based on clinical and endoscopic criteria (e.g. clean ulcer base) can be discharged on the same day as endoscopy.

AB  - Our aims are to review animal models of tauopathies, which include a number of brain disorders with various aetiologies, including ageing, genetics, infectious diseases, toxins, trauma and other unknown factors. Tauopathies are characterized by the accumulation of filaments of the microtubule-associated tau protein. The different aetiopathogeneses and distinct molecular events involved in tau aggregation have led to the development of various animal models for these diseases. In this review, rather than listing all current models, we focus on specific animal models addressing, among others, the question of tau hyperphosphorylation, tau aggregation and tau spreading. Physiological conditions, including normal ageing and hibernation, may exhibit tau phosphorylation and some aspects of tauopathies. However, most of the models of tauopathies involve genetically modified animals (mostly rodents, but also fruit fly, zebrafish and worm). Some of these models have been crucial for the development of therapeutic approaches in humans. The present review shows the difficulty in pinpointing a specific mechanism that may be targeted in tauopathies but also opens up new avenues for innovative therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Summary Increasing number of patients presenting for ophthalmic surgery are using oral anti-coagulant and anti-platelet therapy. The current practice of discontinuing these drugs preoperatively because of a presumed increased risk of bleeding may not be evidence-based and could pose a significant risk to the patient?s health. To provide an evidence-based review on the peri-operative management of ophthalmic patients who are taking anti-thrombotic therapy. In addition, we briefly discuss the underlying conditions that necessitate the use of these drugs as well as management of the operative field in anti-coagulated patients. A semi-systematic review of literature was performed. The databases searched included MEDLINE, EMBASE, database of abstracts of reviews of effects (DARE), Cochrane controlled trial register and Cochrane systematic reviews. In addition, the bibliographies of the included papers were also scanned for evidence. The published data suggests that aspirin did not appear to increase the risk of serious postoperative bleeding in any type of ophthalmic surgery. Topical, sub-tenon, peri-bulbar and retrobulbar anaesthesia appear to be safe in patients on anti-thrombotic (warfarin and aspirin) therapy. Warfarin does not increase the risk of significant bleeding in most types of ophthalmic surgery when the INR was within the therapeutic range. Current evidence supports the continued use of aspirin and with some exceptions, warfarin in the peri-operative period. The risk of thrombosis-related complications on disruption of anticoagulation may be higher than the risk of significant bleeding by continuing its use for most types of ophthalmic surgery.

Among these, replacement of the injured neural and paraneural tissues via cellular transplantation of neural and mesenchymal stem cells has been the most attractive. Extensive experimental studies have been done to identify the safety and effectiveness of this transplantation in animal and human models. Herein, we review the literature for studies conducted, with a focus on the human-related studies, recruitment, isolation, and transplantation, of these multipotent stem cells, and associated outcomes.

AB  - Abstract This brief review focuses on coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and valve surgery and their post-operative effects on cognitive domains. Despite the substantial technical advances in cardiac surgery over the past few decades, the incidence of permanent cognitive impairment remains alarmingly high: 20?70 per cent of patients exhibit cognitive impairment during the first week after surgery, with the incidence declining to 10?40 per cent after 6 weeks and remaining at this level thereafter. We find that language, concentration and motor control are most consistently reported to be affected, while memory, attention and executive function are more variably affected. Valve surgery is generally associated with a worse outcome than CABG surgery. It remains unclear whether the use of the cardio-pulmonary bypass machine adversely affects cognitive outcome. There is an urgent need to identify the risk factors and surgical techniques that influence post-operative cognitive impairment, yet it is difficult to reach meaningful conclusions from the present data due to a lack of concordance in experimental design and data analysis. To address this challenge, future research will need to control for confounds such as mood state, post-operative pain, learning effects, and anaesthesia and will need to compare a wide range of cognitive domains and surgical procedures within large multi-centre studies.

AB  - Summary A large body of evidence from observational and prospective randomized studies in hospitalized patients indicates a strong association between hyperglycemia and increased mortality, morbidity, length of stay, and complications. Hyperglycemia can occur in patients with diabetes, as well as in non-diabetic subjects with stress-induced hyperglycemia. The risk of mortality and complications correlates with the severity of hyperglycemia, with higher risk in patients without a history of diabetes. In addition, numerous studies have shown that improved glycemic control during hospitalization decreases the rate of complications in critical and non-critical care settings. This chapter reviews the risks associated with hyperglycemia in different clinical situations in non-critical care patients and outlines practical protocols for the management of hyperglycemia in patients with stress hyperglycemia and in patients with diabetes admitted to general medicine and surgery services.

AB  - Abstract Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rapidly progressive soft tissue infection with high morbidity and mortality rates. Its occurrence in the head and neck region is uncommon, the majority of reported cases being limited to involvement of the neck, usually from infections of dental or pharyngeal origin. Involvement of the face from NF is rare; only 35 such cases have been reported in the literature since 1960. It is not only associated with a high mortality but can also result in severe disfigurement of the face, posing challenging reconstructive problems. Successful management of facial NF requires early diagnosis, prompt institution of broad spectrum antibiotics, aggressive surgical debridement to control the infection, and reconstruction of the resultant soft tissue defects. This report describes four additional cases of facial necrotizing fasciitis. One of the four patients died as a result of sepsis and multi-organ system failure. Two of the three surviving patients had significant facial disfigurement. A comprehensive review of the facial NF cases reported in the literature is also provided. Based on our experience with facial NF and the results of all previous case reports, the clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, and management of this disease are discussed.

AB  - Diabetic wounds are characterized by disruption of the normal wound repair responses, particularly at the inflammatory and proliferative stages. Inadequate levels of growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), play a significant role in the impaired healing of these wounds. PDGF is a potent mitogen and chemotactic agent, and is released from platelet alpha-granules during the acute inflammatory phase of wound healing. It has been shown to promote the deposition of collagen and granulation tissue, and improves healing in diabetic animals. Although previous studies have shown some success with topically applied PDGF, results in clinical practice have been moderate. In this study, we investigated whether gene therapy with lentiviral vectors carrying the gene for PDGF can improve wound healing in an animal model. Full thickness 2?cm???2?cm dermal wounds were created on the dorsae of genetically diabetic db/db mice. Lentiviral vectors containing the human PDGF-beta gene (lenti-PDGF) were injected into the wound margins and along the wound base. Control experiments were performed using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injections. Mice were sacrificed after 21 days, and wound tissues were harvested for histological analyses. Lenti-PDGF-treated animals demonstrated significantly smaller residual epithelial gaps compared to PBS controls (0.77 +/? 0.07?cm vs. 1.22 +/? 0.30?cm; P?<?0.001), as well as a greater degree of wound closure (85 +/? 3% vs. 57 +/? 22%; P?<?0.05). Lentiviral gene therapy with PDGF is effective in promoting wound healing in genetically diabetic animals, and warrants further investigation.

The clinical trial in our hospital was designed to evaluate the efficacy of CDS for the treatment of refractory skin ulcers. Methods: The application of CDS on the debrided wound was repeated at an interval of 3 to 5 days. The evaluation was performed according to the protocol, especially focused on granulation tissue formation, wound size reduction, and epithelialization. Results: The clinical trials were conducted in 6 cases, including 5 cases with various complications, i.e., diabetes (2 cases), collagen diseases (1 case), renal failure (1 case), and skin defect after resection of tumor (1 case). According to the comprehensive judgement, 5 cases were evaluated as achieving excellent, and 1 case was evaluated as achieving good. Conclusion: The successful application of CDS is dependent on the control of wound conditions free from infection. Appropriate debridment was necessary prior to application of CDS.

AB  - Summary.? von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a common autosomally inherited bleeding disorder associated with mucosal or trauma-related bleeding in affected individuals. VWD results from a quantitative or qualitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a glycoprotein that is essential for primary haemostasis and that carries and protects coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) in the circulation. Through characterization of the phenotype and identification of mutations in the VWF gene in patients with VWD, understanding of the genetics and biochemistry of VWF and VWD has advanced considerably. The importance of specific regions of VWF for its interaction with other components of the vasculature has been revealed, and this has facilitated the formal classification of VWD into three subtypes based upon quantitative (types 1 and 3) and qualitative (type 2) deficiency of VWF. The underlying genetic lesions and associated molecular pathology have been identified in many cases of the qualitative type 2 VWD variants (2A, 2B, 2M, 2N) and in the severe quantitative deficiency, type 3 VWD. However in the partial quantitative deficiency, type 1 VWD, the picture is less clear: there is a variable relationship between plasma levels of VWF and bleeding, there is incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity within affected families, the causative molecular defect is unknown in a substantial number of cases, and even in those cases where the causative mutation is known, the associated molecular pathology is not necessarily understood. This guideline aims to provide a framework for best laboratory practice for the genetic diagnosis of VWD, based upon current knowledge and understanding.

AB  - Abstract Awareness is increasing that risk of venous thromboembolism and development of atherosclerosis is elevated in patients with some chronic inflammatory diseases. This review aimed to examine the risk of vascular disease in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to identify potential pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic approaches. An extensive literature search was conducted using MEDLINE database, Cochrane Library and international conference abstracts for studies pertaining to venous and arterial thromboembolism in adult IBD patients. There is a 1.1?3.6 fold risk of venothromboembolism in IBD, affecting 0.55?6.15% of patients. Risks are increased during a flare or with chronically active inflammation. Evidence is building that there may be a modestly increased risk of arterial disease overall, despite evidence that traditional risk factors may be reduced. Multiple pathogenic factors have been identified including endothelial dysfunction, inflammation-mediated calcium deposition in the media of arteries, hyperhomocysteinemia, platelet activation, and altered coagulation and fibrinolysis. The key to active and preventive therapy is to effectively treat inflammation. Recommendations for prophylaxis of venothromboembolism have followed guidelines where they exist and have been extrapolated from studies of other at-risk conditions, as have those for arterial disease, where screening for risk factors and actively treating abnormalities is encouraged. In conclusion, patients with IBD are at considerably increased risk of venothromboembolism and probably of arterial disease, in particular mesenteric ischemia and ischemic heart disease. Increased penetration of gaps between this knowledge and clinical therapeutic action to prevent thromboembolic events into IBD clinical practice is needed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Although long recognized in microvascular research, an increasing body of evidence suggests that inflammatory markers are present in human diseases. Since the inflammatory cascade serves as a repair mechanism, the presence of inflammatory markers in patient groups has raised an important question about the mechanisms that initiate the inflammatory cascade (i.e., the mechanisms that cause tissue injury). Using a severe form of inflammation, shock, and multiorgan failure, for which there is no accepted injury mechanism, we summarize studies that suggest that the powerful pancreatic digestive enzymes play a central role in the destruction of the intestine and other tissues if their compartmentalization in the lumen of the intestine and in the pancreas is compromised. Further, we summarize evidence that uncontrolled degrading enzyme activity in plasma causes proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain of membrane receptors and loss of associated cell functions. For example, in a model of metabolic disease with type II diabetes, proteolytic cleavage of the insulin receptor causes the inability of insulin to signal glucose transport across membranes. The evidence suggests that uncontrolled proteolytic and lipolytic enzyme activity may trigger the mechanism for tissue injury. The significance of such mechanisms remain to be explored in human diseases.

AB  - Summary A Patient Blood Management programme was established at the University Hospital of Zurich, along with a monitoring and feedback programme, at the beginning of 2014 with a first analysis reported in 2015. Our study aimed to investigate the further impact of this Patient Blood Management monitoring and feedback programme on transfusion requirements and related costs. We included adult patients discharged between 2012 and 2017. A total of 213,882 patients underwent analysis: 66,659 patients in the baseline period (2012?2013); 35,309 patients in the year after the introduction of the Patient Blood Management monitoring and feedback programme (2014) and 111,914 patients in the continued sustainability period (2015?2017). The introduction of the Patient Blood Management monitoring and feedback programme reduced allogeneic blood product transfusions by 35%, from 825 units per 1000 hospital discharges in 2012 to 536 units in 2017. The most sustained effect was an approximately 40% reduction in red blood cell transfusions, from 535 per 1000 discharges to 319 units. Fewer patients were transfused in the periods after the introduction of the Patient Blood Management monitoring and feedback programme (6251 (9.4%) vs. 2932 (8.3%) vs. 8196 (7.3%); p < 0.001). Compared with 2012, the yearly OR for being exposed to any blood transfusion declined steadily after the introduction of the Patient Blood Management monitoring and feedback programme to 0.64 (95%CI 0.61?0.68; p < 0.001) in 2017. For patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, transfusion requirements were also sustainably reduced. This reduction in allogeneic blood transfusions led to savings of 12,713,754 Swiss francs (£ 9,497,000 sterling; EUR 11,100,000; US$ 12,440,000) in blood product acquisition costs over 4 years. In-hospital mortality was not affected by the programme. The Patient Blood Management monitoring and feedback programme sustainably reduced transfusion requirements and related costs, without affecting in-hospital mortality.

AB  - This study describes the origin and early development of a distinct organ of clonal regeneration in Ginkgo biloba, the basal chichi. These aggregates of suppressed shoot buds originate from superficial meristems located in the cotyledonary axils of all Ginkgo seedlings as part of their normal ontogeny. Within 6 wk of germination these buds become embedded in the cortex of the stem, and their subsequent growth and development occurs below the surface of the bark. When stimulated by some traumatic event that damages the seedling axis, one of these embedded cotyledonary buds usually grows down from the trunk to form a woody, rhizomelike basal chichi which, under appropriate conditions, is capable of generating both aerial shoots and adventitious roots. Vegetative regeneration by means of basal chichi has not only contributed to the long-term persistence of G. biloba in the forests of China, but may also have played a role in the remarkable survival of the genus since the Cretaceous.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: Increasing human and laboratory evidence suggests thatpost-resuscitative brain hypothermia reduces the pathologic consequences of brain ischemia. Using a swine model of prolonged cardiac arrest, this investigation sought to determine whether unilateral hypothermic carotid bypass was capable of inducing selective brain hypothermia and reducing neurohistologic damage. Methods: Ventricular fibrillation was induced in common swine (n? 12). After 20 minutes of cardiopulmonary arrest (without ventilatory support or cardiopulmonary resuscitation), systemic extracorporeal bypass was instituted to restore coronary and cerebral perfusion, followed by restoration of normal sinus rhythm. Animals randomized to the normal brain temperature (NBT) cohort received mechanical ventilation and intravenous fluids for 24 hours. The selective brain hypothermia (SBH) cohort received 12 hours of femoral/carotid bypass at 32°C. The bypass temperature was then increased one degree per hour until reaching 37°C and continued at this temperature until completion of the protocol (24 hours). Histopathologic damage was evaluated in two areas of the hippocampus. Results: Normal sinus rhythm was restored in all animals after the systemic (femoral/femoral) bypass was initiated. Nasal temperature (surrogate measure of brain temperature) remained higher than 37.0°C throughout the 24-hour recovery period in the NBT animals. In the SBH cohort, right nasal temperature dropped to the mild hypothermic range (<34°C) two hours after institution of femoral/carotid bypass. This was maintained throughout the 12-hour cooling period without hemodynamic compromise. There was a significant improvement in the neurohistology scores in the CA1 region of the hippocampus of the SBH treated animals as compared with those of the NBT cohort. Conclusions: Post-resuscitative selective brain hypothermia reduced regional ischemic brain damage in swine with prolonged ventricular fibrillation.

AB  - With the improved accessibility to ultrasound, fine needle aspiration of abdominal organs is now performed frequently in many veterinary practices. Despite this, there are many ?unknowns? as to the best method to produce a high-quality sample. This report begins by highlighting recent literature on the risks and benefits of abdominal fine needle aspiration. It follows with recommendations about the equipment and method best suited to the procedure, including needle and syringe size and aspiration versus non-aspiration techniques. Various smear preparations and laboratory submission requirements are also discussed. The final aspect of the review more specifically discusses fine needle aspiration of specific abdominal organs: the liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas, urinary bladder, prostate and abdominal lymph nodes.
