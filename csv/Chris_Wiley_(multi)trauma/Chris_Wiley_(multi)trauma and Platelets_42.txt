AB  - Summary Neuro-oncology covers both the scientific and clinical aspects of central nervous system (CNS) tumours and neurological complications of cancer. Improvements in radiological and histological diagnosis and surgical technique, advances in molecular neuro-oncology, the application of new biological agents and increasing use of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy for tumours such as gliomas have led to small but definite improvements in survival. This chapter provides a clinically dominated guide to the key issues in neuro-oncology. It reflects the highly specialised nature of disciplines within neuro-oncology. The chapter outlines the multi-disciplinary aspects of care on clinical management. Brain tumours include primary tumours arising from intracranial structures and metastases from outside the CNS. There are a number of other rarer tumours in childhood that often present with seizures and behave in a benign fashion. They are usually treated with surgery alone.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: Increasing human and laboratory evidence suggests thatpost-resuscitative brain hypothermia reduces the pathologic consequences of brain ischemia. Using a swine model of prolonged cardiac arrest, this investigation sought to determine whether unilateral hypothermic carotid bypass was capable of inducing selective brain hypothermia and reducing neurohistologic damage. Methods: Ventricular fibrillation was induced in common swine (n? 12). After 20 minutes of cardiopulmonary arrest (without ventilatory support or cardiopulmonary resuscitation), systemic extracorporeal bypass was instituted to restore coronary and cerebral perfusion, followed by restoration of normal sinus rhythm. Animals randomized to the normal brain temperature (NBT) cohort received mechanical ventilation and intravenous fluids for 24 hours. The selective brain hypothermia (SBH) cohort received 12 hours of femoral/carotid bypass at 32°C. The bypass temperature was then increased one degree per hour until reaching 37°C and continued at this temperature until completion of the protocol (24 hours). Histopathologic damage was evaluated in two areas of the hippocampus. Results: Normal sinus rhythm was restored in all animals after the systemic (femoral/femoral) bypass was initiated. Nasal temperature (surrogate measure of brain temperature) remained higher than 37.0°C throughout the 24-hour recovery period in the NBT animals. In the SBH cohort, right nasal temperature dropped to the mild hypothermic range (<34°C) two hours after institution of femoral/carotid bypass. This was maintained throughout the 12-hour cooling period without hemodynamic compromise. There was a significant improvement in the neurohistology scores in the CA1 region of the hippocampus of the SBH treated animals as compared with those of the NBT cohort. Conclusions: Post-resuscitative selective brain hypothermia reduced regional ischemic brain damage in swine with prolonged ventricular fibrillation.

AB  - Summary As survival rates from deep venous thrombosis (DVT) have improved dramatically with the introduction of anticoagulant medication, interest has developed in the long-term sequelae of DVT, namely the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Patients often present with lower limb swelling, aching and even venous claudication, six months to two years after having an episode of DVT. Patients with moderate PTS have quality of life scores which are worse than those for patients suffering from chronic lung disease or arthritis, and patients with severe PTS patients have scores similar to patients suffering from congestive heart failure or cancer. The diagnosis of PTS is a clinical one, with investigation used for characterisation of the lesion and detection of reflux, and also to aide with planning treatment. The CEAP classification (Clinical, Aetiology, Anatomy and Pathophysiology) is useful as a research tool to grade the pattern of disease in chronic venous disease patients.

AB  - Aim: Multi-center clinical trials were performed using allogeneic cultured dermal substitutes (CDS) newly developed in the R & D Center for Artificial Skin of Kitasato University. Method: This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of CDS for the treatment of burns in 5 cases and the treatment of skin ulcers in 4 cases. Complications with the skin ulcers were diabetes (1 case), varix (1 case), and collagen diseases (2 cases). The wound surface area was measured with picture analysis software during the wound healing process. Results: The clinical evaluation was made using a protocol that includes a standard for the development of new wound dressings. According to the comprehensive judgment, the results achieved were evaluated as excellent for 4 burn cases and good for one case. Regarding the skin ulcers, results were excellent in 3 cases and good for one case. No harmful complications were observed during this study. Conclusions: CDS were useful for burn and ulcer treatment but the wound surface must be checked rigorously for the occurrence of infection during the healing process.

AB  - Organ donors are sources of physiologically healthy organs and tissues for life-saving transplantation, and have been recently used for human immunology studies which are typically confined to the sampling of peripheral blood. Donors comprise a diverse population with different causes of death and clinical outcomes during hospitalization, and the effects of such variations on immune parameters in blood and tissues are not known. We present here a coordinate analysis of innate and adaptive immune components in blood, lymphoid (bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes), and mucosal (lungs, intestines) sites from a population of brain-dead organ donors (2 months-93 years; n = 291) across eight clinical parameters. Overall, the blood of donors exhibited similar monocyte and lymphocyte content and low serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines as healthy controls; however, donor blood had increased neutrophils and serum levels of IL-8, IL-6, and MCP-1 which varied with cause of death. In tissues, the frequency and composition of monocytes, neutrophils, B lymphocytes and T cell subsets in lymphoid or mucosal sites did not vary with clinical state, and was similar in donors independent of the extent of clinical complications. Our results reveal that organ donors maintain tissue homeostasis, and are a valuable resource for fundamental studies in human immunology.

AB  - Abstract Background Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) have an increased risk of neurological complications, particularly stroke and silent cerebral infarction (SCI). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a nerve growth factor associated with neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, elevated transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities and increased risk of stroke in patients with SCD. The objective of this study was to analyze plasma BDNF protein levels in children with SCD participating in the Silent Cerebral Infarct Transfusion Multi-Center Clinical Trial (SIT Trial), comparing plasma samples of children with SCD and SCI to plasma samples from children with SCD without SCI, as well as healthy pediatric control participants. Procedure Entry, exit, and longitudinal blood samples were collected from 190 SIT Trial participants with SCD and healthy pediatric controls over time. BDNF levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Sample collection was not optimized for measurements of BDNF, but factors affecting BDNF levels were accounted for in analyses. Results BDNF levels were significantly higher in children with SCD in comparison to healthy pediatric control subjects. BDNF levels significantly increased over time in SCD participants. BDNF levels did not show any significant associations with the presence or absence of SCI or new/progressive SCI/stroke or TCD velocities. Conclusions Plasma BDNF levels are elevated and increase over time in children with SCD. Additional studies with more longitudinal samples are needed to address the reasons for those increased levels.

AB  - Cholesterol embolization syndrome (CES) is a multi-systemic disease caused by embolization of atherosclerotic plaque contents from proximal large-caliber artery to distal small to medium arteries, occurring spontaneously or more commonly after vascular intervention. This report is a comprehensive review of the reported cases of CES found in our literature search. We discuss the risk factors, clinical manifestations, management, and prognosis of CES. The major predisposing factors for CES include older age, male sex, atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk factors, anticoagulation, and femoral access route. The composite incidence of atheroembolic renal disease was 92% and mortality 63%. Our review highlights the importance to recognize this disease entity for the cardiologist and nephrologist.

AB  - Abstract The most common errors in the diagnosis of dementia are underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis. Underdiagnosis is best avoided by careful use of psychometric screening tests to detect cognitive impairment in patients unaware of their own defect. Overdiagnosis can be avoided by not applying the label of ?dementia? until the diagnosis is unequivocal. Complete evaluation is necessary to rule out treatable causes of dementia, and should include medical, neurological, and psychiatric history and examination, simple psychometric tests, laboratory battery, computerized transaxial tomographic brain scan, and electroencephalogram. Ultimately, the diagnosis of dementia may change at follow-up examination, and the unequivocal diagnosis of a specific form of dementia still requires autopsy and neuropathological examination of the brain. The most common causes of cognitive impairment in the elderly include Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, depression, and other specific illnesses such as tumors, Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease, and normal pressure hydrocephalus. Even systemic disease can present as dementia. The evaluation outlined above may help distinguish among these causes. New diagnostic techniques may eventually be helpful as well.

AB  - Abstract The clinical complications of Extracorporal Circulation (ECC) have been linked to disturbances in the microcirculation. In previous experiments we found in vivo an increased Leukocyte/Endothelial (L/E) cell interaction following ECC. As a therapeutical approach to prevent these deleterious effects a new agent, incorporating Hirudin and Prostacyclin, to coate the tubing system was used. Intravital fluorescence microscopy was used on the dorsal skinfold chamber preparation in syrian golden hamsters. ECC was introduced via a micro-rollerpump (1 ml/min) and a 60 cm silicon tube (1 mm inner diameter) shunted between the carotid artery and the jugular vein. Experiments were performed in chronically instrumented, awake animals (age: 10?14 weeks, weight: 65?75 g). Control tubes were uncoated, for the experiment a PEG-Hirudin-Iloprost? coating was used. Isovolemic ECC for 20 min resulted in an increase in rolling (BL: 9 % ± 2; after 4 h: 36 %* ± 5; mean ± SD, *p < 0.05) and adherent leukocytes (BL: 24 ± 26; after 4 h: 260* ± 51; mean ± SD; p < 0.05) in postcapillary venules. The use of the coated tube system resulted in a less pronounced induction of leukocyte/endothelial cell interaction (Roller: BL: 9 % ± 3; 4 h: 24 %* ± 12; mean ± SD, *p < 0.05. Sticker: BL: 28 ± 25; 4 h: 139 ± 111; mean ± SD; p < 0.05). Microhemodynamic parameters and functional capillary density were not significantly affected. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were stable. L/E interaction in the microcirculation has been established as an indicator of the systemic activation induced by blood contact to synthetic surfaces during ECC. Coating the extracorporal circuit reduced the increase in L/E interaction probably as a result of an attenuated activation of the coagulation-fibrinolytic system including a reduced platelet activation.

AB  - Abstract Objective? Enoximone is a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor frequently used to improve cardiac output (CO) in man. As the use of enoximone has not been reported in horses, the effects of this inodilator were examined in isoflurane anaesthetized ponies. Study design? Prospective, randomised, experimental study. Animals? Six healthy ponies, weighing 286 (212?367)?±?52?kg, aged 5.0?±?1.6?years (4?6.5). Methods? After sedation with romifidine [80??g?kg?1 intravenously (IV)], general anaesthesia was induced with midazolam (0.06?mg?kg?1 IV) and ketamine (2.2?mg?kg?1 IV) and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen (Et Iso 1.7%). The ponies were ventilated to maintain eucapnia (PaCO2 4.66?6.00?kPa). Each pony was anaesthetized twice with an interval of 3?weeks; receiving enoximone 0.5?mg?kg?1 IV (E) or saline (S) 90?minutes post-induction. Heart rate (HR), arterial (AP) and right atrial pressure (RAP) were measured before treatment, every 5?minutes between T0 (treatment) and T30 and then every 10?minutes until T120. Cardiac output measurements (lithium dilution technique) and blood gas analysis (arterial and central venous samples) were performed before T0 and at T5, T10, T20, T40, T60, T80, T100 and T120. Stroke volume (SV), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), venous admixture (Q?s/Q?t) and oxygen delivery (?O2) were calculated. Results? Enoximone induced significant increases in HR, CO, SV, Q?s/Q?t and ?O2 and a significant decrease in RAP. No significant differences were detected for AP, SVR and blood gases. No cardiac arrhythmias or other side effects were observed. Conclusions and clinical relevance? The present results suggest that in isoflurane anaesthetized ponies, enoximone has beneficial effects on CO and SV without producing significant changes in blood pressure. Despite an increase in Q?s/Q?t, ?O2 to the tissues was improved.

Burn injury is a complex traumatic event with various local and systemic effects, affecting several organ systems beyond the skin. The pathophysiology of the burn patient shows the full spectrum of the complexity of inflammatory response reactions. In the acute phase, inflammation mechanism may have negative effects because of capillary leak, the propagation of inhalation injury and the development of multiple organ failure. Attempts to mediate these processes remain a central subject of burn care research. Conversely, inflammation is a necessary prologue and component in the later-stage processes of wound healing. In this review, we are attempting to present the current science of burn wound pathophysiology and wound healing. We also describe the evolution of innovative strategies for burn management.

AB  - Summary The ability to cure increasing numbers of individuals for malignant and non-malignant diseases with the use of stem cell transplantation has resulted in a growing number of long-term survivors with unique medical issues. Chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD) continues to be a significant problem in the allogeneic stem cell transplant setting and, as we continue to use alternative stem cell sources and attempt to modulate the immune system to increase an anti-tumour effect, we will probably see rising numbers of patients with this complication. The capacity to treat this problem and improve both the immediate quality of life as well as long-term effects is imperative and requires the ability of haematologists/oncologists to identify chronic GvHD and its multi-organ system presentations. We describe the risk factors for developing chronic GvHD, its presentation and the current treatment options for both initial therapy and secondary treatment.

They are found in up to 80% of patients with epilepsy but are only weakly related to seizure frequency or seizure severity. Indeed their clinical relevance in highly controversial and a principle of treatment is to avoid over-interpretation of epileptiform activity. Experimental data shows that interictal spikes and ictal discharges are generated by different populations of neuron through different cellular and network mechanisms and may represent a condition that delays or prevents seizure onset. However, in the immature brain seizure discharges may cause neuronal cell loss. In older children and adults interictal discharges can be accompanied by brief interruption of cognitive function even in the absence of overt seizures (transitory cognitive impairment). In children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome and CSWS (continuous spike-waves during slow sleep) prolonged nocturnal discharges can have devastating effects on language and / or behavior. This multi-disciplinary workshop will discuss the pathophysiology of interictal discharges and the significance of epileptiform activity in neonates and in older children.

AB  - Background and Objectives? G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells have long replaced marrow as the major source for allogeneic transplants. Conclusive evidence questioning the long-term safety of G-CSF for donors has not been provided, but the cumulative number of followed donors remains insufficient to rule out rare adverse events. A long-term active follow-up study of G-CSF-mobilized healthy volunteer donors was therefore performed. Patients and Methods? Two hundred and three successive donors were evaluated pre-apheresis, subjected to G-CSF-mobilization/apheresis, and actively followed for 5?years by the same physicians and laboratories. Follow-up laboratory work included standard biochemical/haematological tests and T-cell phenotyping. Results? Donor epidemiology was typical for reported stem cell donor cohorts. Acute adverse effects of G-CSF and apheresis were mild and transient, consistent with the previous reports. Mean circulating CD34+ cells after nine doses of G-CSF were 124 per ?l. Other biochemical/haematological parameters were also altered, consistent with G-CSF treatment. Spleen enlargement was modest. At first follow-up, all clinical and laboratory parameters had normalized. Leucocyte/lymphocyte counts and CD4/CD8 ratios were the same as during premobilization work-up and remained unchanged throughout. A single severe but likely unrelated adverse event, a case of papillary thyroid carcinoma, was reported. Conclusion? The studies add an observation time of almost 500 donor years to the growing body of evidence of the long-term safety of G-CSF for allogeneic donor stem cell mobilization.

AB  - Background and Aim Previous studies comparing endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) results with different gauge needles have all been carried out with the stylet in place and show no clear advantage to the larger 22-G needle. Similar data for stylet-free EUS-FNA (SF-EUS-FNA) are unavailable. The aim of the present study was to determine whether diagnostic yield and specimen adequacy is superior with the 22-G needle as compared to the 25-G needle. Methods All patients ≥18 years referred for solid-lesion EUS-FNA were eligible. Patients with suspected diagnosis of lymphoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, sarcoidosis, significant coagulopathy (international normalized ratio >1.5 or platelets <50?000/mm3), use of clopidogrel within 7 days of EUS, and pregnancy were excluded. The two needles were compared regarding diagnostic yield, sample adequacy, bloodiness, ease of puncture, visibility, number of passes, failures, and complications. Results One hundred and twenty consecutive patients were included and 126 lesions were sampled. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for the 22-G SF-EUS-FNA were 83%, 100%, 100% and 56%, respectively, and for the 25-G SF-EUS-FNA were 88.8%, 100%, 100% and 76.5%, respectively (P?=?NS). There were no significant differences between the 22-G and the 25-G FNA needles in sample adequacy, bloodiness, ease of puncture, FNA failure, visibility, number of passes and complications; and no significant differences between either needle were found in relation to lesion site. Conclusion For SF-EUS-FNA, the larger 22-G needle offers no advantage over the smaller 25-G needle.

AB  - Abstract The exocrine pancreas is not a common target organ for toxic drugs and chemicals. It is however the fifth most common human cancer in the western world, and acute and chronic pancreatitis, through various identifiable and unidentified causes, is a common disease in both the developed and developing countries of the world. Both inflammatory disease and cancer of the pancreas is correlated to lifestyle with poor diet and habits, such as moderate to high alcohol intake and smoking, having positive correlations to developing the disease. The chapter describes the functional anatomy of the organ together with its biochemistry that determines toxicity, in particular the role of oxidant damage in the development of cell and tissue damage is thought to be important. The consequences of toxic damage to the acinar cells are severe and primarily result from the auto-activation and hence autodigestion of the tissue by the digestive enzymes normally contained within the exocrine cells, a cascade of apoptosis/necrosis and fibrosis with the ultimate collapse of the organ, subsequent shock, multi-organ collapse and death. The organ has complex molecular mechanisms to prevent premature activation of the digestive enzymes and also has defence mechanisms present to neutralise any premature enzyme activation but these can be rendered ineffectual by factors such as alcohol abuse and a poor diet. Chemical exposure, through both occupational and consumer product usage, has been associated with the development of both pancreatic neoplastic and non-neoplastic disease but the relationship between exposure and disease has never developed further than a simple association and it is likely that the development of pancreatic disease is a multi-faceted combination of inter-related events, none of which in isolation can induce disease. The pancreas has its own array of phase 1 and 2 metabolic enzyme systems and the role of pancreatic drug and chemical activation and detoxification in inducing toxicity is discussed together with the possible secondary effects of hepatic drug/chemical activation and detoxification. Finally the role of animal models of pancreatic disease is discussed in terms of their contribution to understanding the aetiology of the human conditions and the possible use of therapeutic intervention in treating the disease.
