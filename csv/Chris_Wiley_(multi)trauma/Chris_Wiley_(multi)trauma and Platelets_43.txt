AB  - Abstract The exocrine pancreas is not a common target organ for toxic drugs and chemicals. It is however the fifth most common human cancer in the western world, and acute and chronic pancreatitis, through various identifiable and unidentified causes, is a common disease in both the developed and developing countries of the world. Both inflammatory disease and cancer of the pancreas is correlated to lifestyle with poor diet and habits, such as moderate to high alcohol intake and smoking, having positive correlations to developing the disease. The chapter describes the functional anatomy of the organ together with its biochemistry that determines toxicity, in particular the role of oxidant damage in the development of cell and tissue damage is thought to be important. The consequences of toxic damage to the acinar cells are severe and primarily result from the auto-activation and hence autodigestion of the tissue by the digestive enzymes normally contained within the exocrine cells, a cascade of apoptosis/necrosis and fibrosis with the ultimate collapse of the organ, subsequent shock, multi-organ collapse and death. The organ has complex molecular mechanisms to prevent premature activation of the digestive enzymes and also has defence mechanisms present to neutralise any premature enzyme activation but these can be rendered ineffectual by factors such as alcohol abuse and a poor diet. Chemical exposure, through both occupational and consumer product usage, has been associated with the development of both pancreatic neoplastic and non-neoplastic disease but the relationship between exposure and disease has never developed further than a simple association and it is likely that the development of pancreatic disease is a multi-faceted combination of inter-related events, none of which in isolation can induce disease. The pancreas has its own array of phase 1 and 2 metabolic enzyme systems and the role of pancreatic drug and chemical activation and detoxification in inducing toxicity is discussed together with the possible secondary effects of hepatic drug/chemical activation and detoxification. Finally the role of animal models of pancreatic disease is discussed in terms of their contribution to understanding the aetiology of the human conditions and the possible use of therapeutic intervention in treating the disease.

It provides an overview of specific medical considerations involved with dental diagnosis and treatment of this ?at risk population.? The role of oral inflammation is referenced within the context of the oral/systemic paradigm (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease/stroke, respiratory diseases, and cognition). Oral manifestations associated with multi-organ diseases, tobacco/alcohol use, and medications are additionally discussed. Finally, the paper encourages development of interdisciplinary approaches to positively influence health outcomes.

AB  - Background:? Pre-treatment with cholesterol lowering drugs of the statin family may exert protective effects in patients with ischaemic stroke and subarachnoid haemorrhage but their effects are not clear in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). Methods:? We recruited patients admitted to our University Hospital with an acute ICH and analysed pre-admission demographic variables, pre-morbid therapy, clinical and radiological prognostic markers and outcome variables including 90-day modified Rankin score and NIH stroke scale score (NIHSS). Results:? We recruited 399 patients with ICH of which 101 (25%) were using statins. Statin users more often had vascular risk factors, had significantly lower haematoma volumes (P?=?0.04) and had lower mortality rates compared with non-users (45.6% vs. 56.1%; P?=?0.11). However, statin treatment did not have a statistically significant impact on mortality or functional outcome on multiple logistic regression analysis. Conclusions:? Treatment with statins prior to ICH failed to show a significant impact on outcome in this analysis despite lower haematoma volumes.

AB  - Preferences for different ages of perishable products exist in many applications, including grocery items and blood products. In this paper, we study a multi-period stochastic perishable inventory system with multiple priority classes that require products of different ages. The firm orders the product with a positive lead time and sells it to multiple demand classes, each only accepting products with remaining lifetime longer than a threshold. In each period, after demand realization, the firm decides how to allocate the on-hand inventory to different demand classes with different backorder or lost-sale cost. At the end of each period, the firm can dispose inventory of any age. We formulate this problem as a Markov decision process and characterize the optimal ordering, allocation, and disposal policies. When unfulfilled demand is backlogged, we show that the optimal order quantity is decreasing in the inventory levels and is more sensitive to the inventory level of fresher products, the optimal allocation policy is a sequential rationing policy, and the optimal disposal policy is characterized by n ? 1 thresholds. For the lost-sale case, we show that the optimal allocation and disposal policies have the same structure but the optimal ordering policy may be different. Based on the structure of the optimal policy, we develop an efficient heuristic with a cost that is at most 4% away from the optimal cost in our numerical examples. Using numerical studies, we show that the ordering and allocation policies are close to optimal even if the firm cannot intentionally dispose products. Moreover, ignoring the differences between demand classes and using simple allocation policy (e.g., FIFO) can significantly increase the total cost. We examine how the firm can improve the control of perishable items and show that the benefit of decreasing the lead time is more significant than that of increasing the lifetime of the products or that of decreasing the acceptance threshold of the demand. The analysis is extended to systems with age dependent disposal cost and with stochastic supply.

AB  - Summary Portal vascular anomalies (PVAs) in dogs and cats include congenital or acquired macrovascular portosystemic shunts (PSS), portal venous hypoplasia (microvascular dysplasia), hepatic arteriovenous malformation, and noncirrhotic portal hypertension with portal vein atresia. Congenital portosystemic shunts (CPSS) are the most common PVA managed surgically. Cats with CPSS are generally considered to have a higher complication rate and poorer outcome than dogs. Hypothermia is reported as an early predictor of postoperative death in toy breeds. Systemic hypotension is a common problem during anesthesia and surgery for CPSS and is often multifactorial. Hypoglycemia occurs commonly in dogs with CPSS, particularly small breeds. Intraoperative bleeding is most commonly considered a complication of surgery for IHPSS, although the specific incidence of intraoperative hemorrhage in CPSS surgery is rarely reported. Hypoalbuminemia is a common biochemical abnormality in dogs with CPSS but is rarely reported in cats with CPSS. Status epilepticus is a devastating complication of surgery for CPSS.

AB  - Background? It is estimated that skin cancers cost $33 million per annum to the New Zealand healthcare system. Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are the commonest types of non melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs). Anecdotal evidence indicates that there has been a doubling in the incidence of NMSCs in New Zealand over the last decade. Because of the high incidence mandatory reporting of NMSCs to the National Cancer Registry is not required. This lack of accurate data has led to poor health care policies and strategies including funding and workforce planning. Aims? The aims of this study are to (1) present the latest statistics on NMSCs in New Zealand, including the incidence across different regions over the last decade, patient demographics, anatomic distribution of NMSCs, incidence and sites of metastasis, and disease-specific survival; to (2) the histopathology of NMSCs, including surgical margins, histologic grade, and perineural, lymphatic, and vascular invasion; and (3) the relative role of different faculties treating NMSCs. Method? This project has been approved by the multi-centre ethics committee. A retrospective review was conducted from patients? histology records from public and private pathology laboratories within defined catchment areas. Criterion for analysis is a confirmed diagnosis of NMSC treated surgically. A Microsoft Access database is created that will facilitate subsequent data retrieval and analysis. Results and Conclusion? It is hoped that this up-to-date data will form the framework for the development of sound and sustainable healthcare policies of management of NMSCs including management strategies and workforce planning, and research direction on this common disease.

AB  - Abstract Bioprinting as an enabling technology for tissue engineering possesses the promises to fabricate highly mimicked tissue or organs with digital control. As one of the biofabrication approaches, bioprinting has the advantages of high throughput and precise control of both scaffold and cells. Therefore, this technology is not only ideal for translational medicine but also for basic research applications. Bioprinting has already been widely applied to construct functional tissues such as vasculature, muscle, cartilage, and bone. In this review, the authors introduce the most popular techniques currently applied in bioprinting, as well as the various bioprinting processes. In addition, the composition of bioink including scaffolds and cells are described. Furthermore, the most current applications in organ and tissue bioprinting are introduced. The authors also discuss the challenges we are currently facing and the great potential of bioprinting. This technology has the capacity not only in complex tissue structure fabrication based on the converted medical images, but also as an efficient tool for drug discovery and preclinical testing. One of the most promising future advances of bioprinting is to develop a standard medical device with the capacity of treating patients directly on the repairing site, which requires the development of automation and robotic technology, as well as our further understanding of biomaterials and stem cell biology to integrate various printing mechanisms for multi-phasic tissue engineering.

AB  - Summary.? The biphasic waveform is an early marker of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Neutrophil elastase (NE) cleaves coagulation factors; thus, elevated elastase levels or its dysregulation by α-1-protease inhibitor (?1PI) may be linked to DIC. Time courses over a period were determined for factors associated with NE and coagulation in 14 Intensive Care Unit patients with a biphasic waveform who developed DIC. The data were analyzed using a random coefficient linear regression model to predict the variables' mean values on day 0 and their mean rates of change over the period in which the biphasic waveform appeared. The biphasic waveform was normal on day 0, maximized on day 1, and approached normal again by day 4. ?1PI/NE complex levels were 2.5-fold greater than normal for the entire period. The A1PI activity, antigen, and specific activity levels were normal on day 0 and increased thereafter by 21.0, 10.5, and 8.9% of normal per day, respectively. Factor II, V, VII, IX, and X activity levels were, respectively, 57, 46, 46, 77, and 46% of normal on day 0, whereas factor VIII and fibrinogen levels were normal. All coagulation factor levels trended upward with time but not significantly. The prothrombin time, but not the activated partial thromboplastin time, was prolonged, and the platelet counts and hematocrits were below normal on day 0 and remained so thereafter. We conclude that events associated with neutrophil activation, elastase release, and perturbations of coagulation precede both the appearance of the biphasic waveform and the diagnosis of DIC in these patients.

A 20-year-old Quarter Horse gelding (Case 2) was evaluated for respiratory stertor and severe, acute swelling of the head in the submandibular region. A physical examination, complete blood count, blood chemistry, upper airway endoscopy, and peripheral blood Anaplasma phagocytophilum polymerase chain reaction were completed for both horses. Both horses tested positive for A. phagocytophilum. The upper airway endoscopy for Case 1 revealed a feed contaminated pharynx, absent swallowing reflex, and left laryngeal hemiplagia. The upper airway endoscopy for Case 2 revealed severe diffuse pharyngeal swelling occluding the airway. Due to increased respiratory effort in Case 2, a tracheotomy was performed. In both horses, treatment consisted of intravenous oxytetracycline 6.6 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 24 h for 2?3 days followed by minocycline 4 mg/kg bwt per os q. 12 h for 10?14 days. Both horses made full recoveries.

AB  - Cognitive dysfunction remains a significant complication after cardiopulmonary bypass, despite continuous improvement in the overall outcome in open-heart surgery. Embolization of the atheromatous material, most notably during removal of the aortic clamp, is a major cause. Strategies have been developed to minimize cerebral embolization. Modified surgical techniques include the use of hypothermic circulatory arrest, venting of the left ventricle, minimizing aortic manipulation, and the use of epiaortic ultrasound to locate and avoid trauma to the aortic atheromatous plaque. Use of an intra-aortic filter has been shown recently to reduce intraoperative cerebral embolic events and improve postoperative neurocognitive outcomes. Off-pump coronary artery bypass technique has also been claimed to have lower neurological complications, which is probably attributable to the avoidance of aortic cannulation and cardiopulmonary bypass. Its role on cerebral protection is, however, debatable. Chinese Abstract Chinese Abstract

AB  - Summary Exercise induced pulmonary haemorrhage (EIPH) is a serious problem in the Thoroughbred industry. The condition apparently occurs essentially in all Thoroughbreds in training but the mechanism has proved elusive. There is now strong evidence that the condition is caused by mechanical failure of the walls of the pulmonary capillaries when the pressure inside them rises to very high levels. It is well known that pulmonary capillaries have extremely thin walls to allow rapid exchange of respiratory gases across them. Recently we have shown that the wall stresses are very large when the capillary transmural pressure is raised, and in anesthetised rabbits, ultrastructural damage to the walls is seen at pressures of 40 mmHg and above. The incidence of stress failure is greatly increased at high lung volumes; and many of the ultrastructural changes are rapidly reversible when the capillary pressure is reduced. The principal forces acting on the capillary have been analysed. The strength of the thin part of the capillary wall can be attributed to the Type IV collagen in the extracellular matrix. The pulmonary vascular pressures of galloping Thoroughbreds reach very high levels. Mean pulmonary artery and left atrial pressures of up to 120 and 70 mmHg respectively have been directly measured with indwelling catheters. The reason for the high pulmonary vascular pressures is that these animals have been selectively bred over hundreds of years to run at great speeds over short distances and their maximal oxygen consumptions are very high. As a consequence, cardiac outputs are substantial, and the left ventricle needs very high filling pressures. Ultrastructural studies of Thoroughbred lungs after galloping show the typical changes of stress failure of capillaries. Calculations of capillary wall stress from measurements of the radius of the capillaries and the thickness of the wall confirm that the stresses are very high. The fact that the lesions of EIPH are most commonly seen initially in the dorso caudal region of the lung appears to argue against the stress failure hypothesis. However, it is known that resting blood flow is particularly high to that region and it may also be that the alveolar pressure falls transiently to very low levels or that the alveoli in that region are overexpanded. All these factors could increase capillary wall stress. There is evidence that frusemide reduces pulmonary vascular pressures during galloping. However, the blood gas barrier needs to be extremely thin for gas exchange, but immensely strong to withstand the capillary wall stresses. Thoroughbreds fail on both counts. First they develop arterial hypoxaemia as a result of diffusion limited oxygen transfer in the lung during galloping and, therefore, they cannot afford to have thicker blood-gas barriers. On the other hand, their capillary walls are not strong enough to withstand the substantial wall stresses that develop as a result of the high capillary pressures. Therefore, to some extent, EIPH is an inevitable consequence of the extremely high cardiac outputs required by these elite athletes.

AB  - Abstract In 2015, it can be said that the diabetic foot is no longer the Cinderella of diabetic complications. Thirty years ago there was little evidence-based research taking place on the diabetic foot, and there were no international meetings addressing this topic. Since then, the biennial Malvern Diabetic Foot meetings started in 1986, the American Diabetes Association founded their Foot Council in 1987, and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes established a Foot Study Group in 1998. The first International Symposium on the Diabetic Foot in The Netherlands was convened in 1991, and this was soon followed by the establishment of the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot that has produced useful guidelines in several areas of investigation and the management of diabetic foot problems. There has been an exponential rise in publications on diabetic foot problems in high impact factor journals, and a comprehensive evidence-base now exists for many areas of treatment. Despite the extensive evidence available, it, unfortunately, remains difficult to demonstrate that most types of education are efficient in reducing the incidence of foot ulcers. However, there is evidence that education as part of a multi-disciplinary approach to diabetic foot ulceration plays a pivotal role in incidence reduction. With respect to treatment, strong evidence exists that offloading is the best modality for healing plantar neuropathic foot ulcers, and there is also evidence from two randomized controlled trials to support the use of negative-pressure wound therapy in complex post-surgical diabetic foot wounds. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy exhibits the same evidence level and strength of recommendation. International guidelines exist on the management of infection in the diabetic foot. Many randomized trials have been performed, and these have shown that the agents studied generally produced comparable results, with the exception of one study in which tigecycline was shown to be clinically inferior to ertapenem?±?vancomycin. Similarly, there are numerous types of wound dressings that might be used in treatment and which have shown efficacy, but no single type (or brand) has shown superiority over others. Peripheral artery disease is another major contributory factor in the development of ulceration, and its presence is a strong predictor of non-healing and amputation. Despite the proliferation of endovascular procedures in addition to open revascularization, many patients continue to suffer from severely impaired perfusion and exhaust all treatment options. Finally, the question of the true aetiopathogenesis of Charcot neuroarthropathy remains enigmatic, although much work is currently being undertaken in this area. In this area, it is most important to remember that a clinically uninfected, warm, insensate foot in a diabetic patient should be considered as a Charcot foot until proven otherwise, and, as such, treated with offloading, preferably in a cast.

Only one patient showed evidence of chronic active hepatitis with progression to active micronodular cirrhosis although a further four patients showed some evidence of mild chronic active hepatitis. This represents a much lower incidence of severe histological liver damage than many previous reports and implies that liver biopsy in asymptomatic haemophiliacs may not be indicated as a routine procedure, particularly in the absence of proven therapy. Dynamic liver function tests may prove to be a useful indicator of deteriorating liver function in the otherwise asymptomatic haemophiliac.

AB  - Summary As the practice of canine rehabilitation and sports medicine continues to evolve, roles of practitioners are more specialized as approaches become more advanced. Clinical reasoning, care pathways, and specific applied interventions are adopted from the interprofessional practice of human sports medicine, requiring knowledge and understanding of the art and science of physical rehabilitation and related medical sciences. Contributing to a multifaceted team, the rehabilitation professional must be able to synthesize information related to the integrity and efficiency of the neuromusculoskeletal system, in coordination with other body systems, to affect the functional abilities of the patient. This is accomplished through the examination and evaluation of the patient with the purpose of identifying medical comorbidities, specific impairments, functional limitations, and disabilities. Understanding the interplay between the objective information collected during the rehabilitation examination and evaluation, patient-specific factors, and knowledge of basic sciences, physics, and biomechanics will guide the therapist in establishing a treatment plan that will ultimately contribute to the patient's return to an optimal level of function following injury, illness, or onset of a medical disorder or disease. The purpose of this introductory chapter is to: Define the practice of canine rehabilitation. Describe various contributions of the different members of the interprofessional canine rehabilitation team. Discuss the history and evolution of the practice of canine rehabilitation in the United States and internationally. Describe the practice of physical therapy as it pertains to the management of the canine rehabilitation patient. Discuss specific physiological considerations for the canine rehabilitation therapist when planning rehabilitation interventions. Describe patient management and treatment planning methods by which the canine rehabilitation therapist coordinates the implementation of treatment strategies and interventions.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is not rare, which would affect the patient?s prognosis. Objectives To examine the prevalence, risk factors and clinical characteristics of AECOPD patients with VTE. Methods We performed this multi-center, prospective, observational study that involved 16 hospitals in China. Patients admitted to hospital due to AECOPD were consecutively enrolled. Baseline characteristics, VTE risk factors, symptoms, signs and auxiliary examination results were collected. Lower limb venous ultrasound and computed tomography pulmonary angiography were examined. Results Between June 2009 and October 2010, a total of 1144 AECOPD patients (the average age 72.0 ± 9.1 years, 761 males) were enrolled in this study. Seventy-eight (6.8%) were diagnosed with VTE, including 24 PE, 64 DVT, 10 combined PE and DVT. VTE patients were older than non-VTE patients. History of venous thromboembolism and lower extremity varicose vein, and presence of longer immobility (≥3 days), lower limbs problems of swelling, pain and walking difficulties, diuretics use, fever, syncope, higher d-dimer and lower hemoglobin were more common in VTE patients than in non-VTE patients. After adjusting the covariates, venous thrombosis history, prolonged immobility (≥3 days), lower limb pain before hospitalization, higher d-dimer independently associated with VTE development. Regular glucocorticoid use was not associated with increased risk of VTE in this set of patients. Conclusion VTE is relatively common among hospitalized AECOPD patients. Conventional prophylactic anticoagulant therapy may be considered for those hospitalized AECOPD patients with risk factors.

AB  - A 29-year-old man from east texas presented with a 3-month history of a large, isolated, painful subcutaneous nodule on his lower right leg. An excisional biopsy showed zones of necrosis in the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous adipose tissue with a neutrophilic infiltrate. The dermis showed a mixed infiltrate with necrotic debris and a non-gravid adult female filarial nematode with a thick, multi-layered cuticle, paired uteri, and an intestine. The histologic features were diagnostic for dirofilaria tenuis, the raccoon heartworm. Dirofilaria tenuis causes heartworm infection in raccoons and infrequently causes human disease. When humans do contract dirofilariasis, the mode of transmission is via a bite from a mosquito infected with dirofilaria larvae. Humans are a dead end host and dirofilaria cannot reproduce in humans, but they do cause various lesions at the site of the mosquito bites. We report a very rare case of human dirofilaria tenuis infection manifesting as a subcutaneous nodule. Dirofilaria tenuis infections are very rare in the U.S., and usually occur in the Southeastern U.S.
