AB  - Mammalian skeletal muscle is notable for both its highly ordered biophysical structure and its regenerative capacity following trauma. Critical to both of these features is the specialized muscle extracellular matrix, comprising both the multiple concentric sheaths of connective tissue surrounding structural units from single myofibers to whole muscles and the dense interstitial matrix that occupies the space between them. Extracellular matrix-dependent interactions affect all activities of the resident muscle stem cell population (the satellite cells), from maintenance of quiescence and stem cell potential to the regulation of proliferation and differentiation. This review focuses on the role of the extracellular matrix in muscle regeneration, with a particular emphasis on regulation of satellite-cell activity.

AB  - Objective: Evaluation of efficacy and safety of a novel controlled-release formulation of carbimazole in feline hyperthyroidism. Methods: A multicentre, self-controlled study in 44 client-owned cats with history and clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, and total thyroxine concentration greater than or equal to 50 nmol/l. Treatment was started at 15 mg once daily, response assessed after 10 days, and 3, 5, 8, 26 and 53 weeks and dose adjusted as required. Results: The median dose of carbimazole was 10 mg (range 10 to 15 mg) and 15 mg (5 to 25 mg) once daily after 3 and 53 weeks, respectively. Median total thyroxine concentration dropped significantly from 118 nmol/l (50 to 320 nmol/l) at presentation to 33 nmol/l (n=40) after 10 days, 31 nmol/l (n=34) at 3 weeks and 21 nmol/l (n=18) at 53 weeks. Clinical signs improved or resolved in almost all cats within three weeks after starting treatment. Twenty-one adverse reactions possibly (20) or probably (1) related to treatment were reported. During treatment, increased blood urea nitrogen concentration was observed in 25 per cent of the cats, eosinophilia in 20 per cent and lymphopenia in 16 per cent, while liver enzymes tended to improve. Clinical Significance: Once daily administration of controlled-release carbimazole tablets was effective and had expected tolerance in hyperthyroid cats during short- and long-term treatment.

AB  - The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) Journal of Clinical Apheresis (JCA) Special Issue Writing Committee is charged with reviewing, updating, and categorizing indications for the evidence-based use of therapeutic apheresis in human disease. Since the 2007 JCA Special Issue (Fourth Edition), the Committee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approaches in the grading and categorization of apheresis indications. This Seventh Edition of the JCA Special Issue continues to maintain this methodology and rigor to make recommendations on the use of apheresis in a wide variety of diseases/conditions. The JCA Seventh Edition, like its predecessor, has consistently applied the category and grading system definitions in the fact sheets. The general layout and concept of a fact sheet that was used since the fourth edition has largely been maintained in this edition. Each fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of therapeutic apheresis in a specific disease entity. The Seventh Edition discusses 87 fact sheets (14 new fact sheets since the Sixth Edition) for therapeutic apheresis diseases and medical conditions, with 179 indications, which are separately graded and categorized within the listed fact sheets. Several diseases that are Category IV which have been described in detail in previous editions and do not have significant new evidence since the last publication are summarized in a separate table. The Seventh Edition of the JCA Special Issue serves as a key resource that guides the utilization of therapeutic apheresis in the treatment of human disease. J. Clin.

AB  - Abstract Acute brain injuries such as caused by stroke are amongst the leading causes of death and are the leading cause of disability. Despite this there are very limited therapeutic options, and new therapeutic strategies and targets are required. Inflammation is known to exacerbate brain injury and is now considered as a potential therapeutic target. The damaging inflammation that occurs after acute brain injury is driven by pro-inflammatory members of the interleukin (IL)?1 cytokine family, namely, IL-1α and IL-1?. Previous research efforts have focussed on the biology and contribution of IL-1?. However, we now recognise that IL-1α is an early and important mediator of inflammation after injury. This review focuses on what is known about IL-1α, its regulation and its contribution to brain injury. Inhibiting mechanisms regulating the processing and release of IL-1α may offer new therapeutic targets for the treatment of devastating acute brain injuries. ? 2015 IUBMB Life, 2015 67(5):323?330, 2015

AB  - BACKGROUND Astronauts on exploration missions may be at risk for traumatic injury and medical conditions that lead to life threatening hemorrhage. Resuscitation protocols are limited by the austere conditions of spaceflight. Solutions may be found in low-resource terrestrial settings. The existing literature on alternative blood product administration and walking blood banks was evaluated for applicability to spaceflight. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A literature review was done using PubMed and Google Scholar. References were crosschecked for additional publications not identified using the initial search terms. Twenty-seven articles were identified, including three controlled trials, six retrospective cohort analyses, 15 reviews, one case report, and two experimental studies. RESULTS Solutions to blood transfusion in austere settings include lyophilized blood products, hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs), and fresh whole blood. Many of these products are investigational. Protocols for walking blood banks include methods for screening and activating donors, transfusion, and monitoring for adverse reactions. Microgravity and mission limitations create additional challenges for transfusion, including baseline physiologic changes, difficulty reconstituting lyophilized products, risk of air emboli during transfusion, equipment constraints, and limited evacuation and surgical options. CONCLUSION Medical planning for space exploration should consider the possibility of acute blood loss. A model for ?floating? blood banks based on terrestrial walking blood bank protocols from austere environments is presented, with suggestions for future development. Constraints on volume, mass, storage, and crew, present challenges to blood transfusion in space and must be weighed against the benefits of expanding medical capabilities.

AB  - Abstract Limb/digit amputation is a common event in humans caused by trauma, medical illness, or surgery. Although the loss of a digit is not lethal, it affects quality of life and imposes high costs on amputees. In recent years, the increasing interest in limb regeneration has led to enhanced scientific knowledge. However, the limited ability to develop functional limb regeneration in the clinical setting suggests that a challenging issue remains in limb regeneration. Recently, the emergence of regenerative engineering is a promising field to address this challenge and close the gap between science and clinical applications. Cell signalling and molecular mechanisms involved in the limb regeneration process have been extensively studied; however, there is still insufficient data on cell therapy and tissue engineering for limb regeneration. In this review, we intend to focus on therapeutic approaches for limb regeneration that are closely related to gene, immune, and stem cell therapies, as well as tissue engineering approaches that take into consideration the peculiar developmental properties of the limbs. In addition, we attempt to identify the challenges of these strategies for limb regeneration studies in terms of clinical settings and as a road map to accomplish the goal of functional human limb regeneration.

AB  - ABSTRACT The features of 30 cases of canine rheumatoid arthritis are described. The disease is a chronic symmetrical polyarthritis characterized by erosive, destructive changes within the joint. The latter can be identified on radiographs by loss of mineral, the presence of discrete erosions or an irregular joint margin. Increased periarticular soft tissue is common and periosteal new bone is not unusual. The most obvious clinical feature is generalized stiffness particularly after rest. Joints are often thickened and painful on manipulation. A third of cases present with pyrexia, lethargy and inappetence in addition to lameness. Synovial fluid evaluation shows an increased number of white cells, most of which are polymorphs; the mucin clot is poor. The ESR is generally increased and rheumatoid factor (an antiglobulin auto-antibody) is present in 73 per cent of cases. Treatment is often unrewarding, although many dogs can cope for considerable periods of time.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides the interventional oncology (IO) clinician with the basics of veterinary oncology in regards to the current tumor staging systems for relevant tumors. The most common staging system is the World Health Organization (WHO) TNM staging system. Specifically this is based on the size and/or extent of the primary tumor (T), presence or absence of lymph node involvement (N), and whether metastasis (M), has occurred. The chapter presents an understanding of the chemotherapy basics, including commonly used drugs, proper administration, disposal, toxicities and their associated grading schemes, and the basics of radiation therapy (RT). RT may be used in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting, as well as a single modality or concurrently to chemotherapy. The chapter also provides an introduction to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and their expanding use in veterinary medicine, and standard criteria for defining responses in an effort to further standardize studies that evaluate cancer therapies.

AB  - A 10-year-old, entire, male, mixed-breed dog was presented for severe haematuria and stranguria. Ultrasound revealed a large intraluminal urinary bladder blood clot and a prostatic space-occupying lesion. Invasion of the lesion into the prostatic urethra was detected ultrasonographically during compression of the urinary bladder. Post-mortem examination revealed primary prostatic haemangiosarcoma infiltrating the urethra. Haemangiosarcoma should be considered as a rare cause of prostatic mass lesions, haematuria or lower urinary tract signs in dogs.

Animals with the pyothorax can have severe systemic signs, and despite a variety of potential causes the principles of therapy are relatively similar between species and etiologies. The pyothorax is most often associated with a bacterial infection. Clinical history and physical examination abnormalities in animals with the pyothorax relate to respiratory and systemic illness. Clinical signs can be present in animals for weeks to months prior to presentation. The principles of treatment of animals with the pyothorax include removal of the septic effusion and long-term treatment with appropriate antibiotics. Indications for surgical treatment of the pyothorax include evidence of a surgically resectable lesion thought to be responsible for the pyothorax, such as an abscess, mass, or foreign body, or inadequate response to medical management.

AB  - Summary A significant proportion of the mortality and morbidity of severe burns is attributable to the ensuing hypermetabolic response that typically lasts for at least 9?12 months post-injury. This is associated with impaired wound healing, increased infection risks, erosion of lean body mass, hampered rehabilitation and delayed reintegration of burn survivors into society. The endocrine status is markedly altered during this period with an initial and then sustained increase in proinflammatory ?stress? hormones such as cortisol and other glucocorticoids, and catecholamines including epinephrine and norepinephrine by the adrenal medulla and cortex. These hormones exert catabolic effects leading to muscle wasting, the intensity of which depends upon the percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) involved, as well as the time elapsed since initial injury. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies may be used to reverse the catabolic effect of thermal injury. Of these, ?-adrenergic blockade with propranolol has been the most efficacious anti-catabolic therapy in the treatment of burns. The underlying mechanism of action of propranolol is still unclear, however its effect appears to occur due to an increased protein synthesis in the face of a persistent protein breakdown and reduced peripheral lipolysis. This article aims to review the current understanding of catecholamines in postburn muscle wasting and focuses on the clinical and metabolic effects of ?-blockade in severe burns.

AB  - When the pulp of a tooth is irreversibly inflamed or necrotic and the apex is open, conventional root canal treatment is difficult to perform and the outcome is uncertain. Traditionally, the apexification procedure has consisted of multiple and long-term applications of calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] to create an apical barrier to aid the obturation. Recently, artificial apical barriers such as those made with mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) have been used in teeth with necrotic pulps and open apices. More recently, procedures referred to as regenerative endodontics have received much attention as an option for these teeth. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive literature review from May 1952?May 2011 regarding the management of teeth with necrotic pulps and open apices. This review covers the articles published in dental journals and book chapters regarding the definition, history, materials used, animal and human studies, mechanisms of action, prognosis, as well as advantages and disadvantages of apexification, apical plugs, and regenerative endodontics.

AB  - Antibody-mediated transfusion-related acute lung injury (immune TRALI) is now recognized as the most common cause of transfusion-associated major morbidity and death in the Western world. Among the implicated leucocyte antibodies, these ones directed against the human leucocyte antigens (HLA) class II, human neutrophil alloantigens (HNA)-3a and HLA-A2 antigens are frequently associated with severe (artificial ventilation required) and fatal cases. There is accumulating evidence that preventive measures such as transfusion of plasma-rich blood components from male donors or from donors tested negative for leucocyte antibodies are effective in the reduction of severe and fatal immune TRALI.

AB  - Objectives: To determine owner's perception of their pet's quality of life during treatment with carboplatin for a variety of canine and feline neoplasms. Methods: Owners were contacted via a postal questionnaire and asked questions regarding their perception of chemotherapy in pets and their perception of carboplatin treatment in their pet. Results: Twenty-eight (59%) of owners responded to the questionnaire. Forty-three percent of owners had not considered chemotherapy in pets before treatment; however, after treatment, 89% of owners supported its use. Sixteen (57%) patients had mild to severe side effects. Most patients experienced mild side effects, including lethargy and loss of appetite. Quality of life during treatment was reduced compared with prediagnosis quality of life however at its best was significantly improved compared with pretreatment quality of life. Eighty-nine per cent of respondents did not regret treating their pet. Clinical Significance: Carboplatin is well tolerated by both owners and pets. Most patients have either no side effects or experience mild lethargy or inappetence. Carboplatin treatment, either alone or in conjunction with other medications, should be considered as a palliative treatment in both dogs and cats with susceptible neoplasms.
