AB  - Introduction? The central focus of eyelid reconstruct is the reconstitution of a dynamic protective covering for the cornea. The key to successful eyelid reconstruction is to properly assess the size of the defect and to separate the complex defect down into component parts or subunits. Since eyelid tissues retract in the presence of discontinuity, the residual lid margin has to be distracted under normal tension in order to assess the true size of the defect. In surgical planning, one must also assess the amount and location of inner and outer lamellar tissue absent. The inner lamella represents the conjunctiva, the tarsal plate, and the tarsoligamentous sling. The primary function is to provide lining and support to the lid. The most important region to reconstruct the inner lamella, the conjunctiva in particular, is centrally over the cornea in the upper lid. The outer lamella is represented by the skin and orbicularis oculi muscle. In the upper lid, the outer lamella has functional importance by enabling the dynamic blink to protect the cornea and prevent exposure. Small reconstructions may be carried out as a single stage, larger ones may require more than one stage. The fundamental principle is to utilize the following techniques for defects of increasing complexity and/or size 1) primary closure, 2) adjacent tissue, 3) lid sharing, and 4) regional or distant flap. Methods/Technique? Depending on the size of the defect, direct closure may be possible. Upper lids with a defect of 1/3 or less of the horizontal length can be closed directly. The criteria for lower lid direct closure is 1/4 to 1/3 of the horizontal length. Closure under too much tension will cause mechanical ptosis in the upper lid and lid retraction in the lower lid due to the close line effect. A selective (upper or lower) canthotomy will provide an additional 3?4?mm of length through tissue recruitment. The next order of reconstruction is the semicircular Tenzel skin muscle flap. This option is for subtotal defects greater than 1/3. Depending on the design, this flap can be used for upper or lower lid defects. By recruiting lateral tissue, end-to-end closure of the wound is achieved centrally, while the original defect undergoes lateralization. The absence of lashes laterally is better tolerated than centrally. The next order of reconstruction involves lid sharing. Upper lid tissue used for lower lid reconstruction includes the Hughes flap which shares a part of the upper lid tarsal plate and conjunctiva. Total upper lid reconstruction uses the lower lid Cutler-Beard flap with ear cartilage to replace missing tarsal plate. Both the Hughes procedure and the Cutler Beard Bridge Flap are two-stage procedures that are divided 2 weeks after the initial lid sharing. The visual axis is obstructed for two weeks until the bridge is divided. The Hewes? flap is a single stage reconstruction lid sharing for lower lateral defects. It is based on the superior vascular arcade. Distant flaps such as the Tripier, Fricke, and forehead or glabelllar flaps are used for large defects when other options are not possible. Results? Over the past 12 years 218 eyelid reconstructions were performed. 75% were cancer related and 25% were trauma related. 50% were secondary reconstructions referred from other surgeons. The average age of the patients was 60 evenly distributed between males and females. 90% of the cancer related defects were created by a Moh?s surgeon. Upper lid defects represented 25%and lower lid defects represented 75%. The distribution of procedures used is as follows: 25% direct closure (selective canthotomy was often employed for direct closure), 40% Tenzel flap, 15% lid sharing flaps, 10% Hewes flaps, and 10% distant flaps. Mucosal grafts were required for secondary cases of the upper lid. 10% of patients required a revision surgery (other than planned bridge division). The most frequent complications were lid malposition, excess lateral orbital skin, and need for lacrimal reconstruction with DCR, Jones? tubes or Crawford tubes. Permanent corneal damage or rupture was prevented in all cases. Conclusion? Eyelid reconstruction simplified by breaking complex defects into their component parts. Algorithmic linkage of reconstructive method to shape and size of defect also assist with consistent successful results. Eyelid reconstruction balances the functional result of the reconstructve procedures as well as the aesthetic result in order to minimize morbidity.

AB  - Summary.? von Willebrand disease (vWD) is the most common congenital bleeding disorder in the USA, affecting 1?3% of the population. Previously characterizing the bleeding symptoms in females with type 1 vWD, we evaluated 42 males with type 1 vWD, mean age 16?years (1?64), of whom 24 (57%) presented with bleeding symptoms. The most common initial symptom was postoperative bleeding (26%). The most common bleeding symptoms ever were epistaxis (53%), bruising (50%), postoperative bleeding (47%), haematomas (29%) and oral bleeding (29%). Of postoperative bleeding, ear/nose/throat (44%), dental (17%) and circumcision bleeding (22%) occurred at a median 10?years of age, despite a previous bleeding or family history in 89%. Complications included anaemia in five (12%), neurological sequelae after subdural haematoma and tonsillectomy in two (5%), transfusion-associated hepatitis C in two (5%) and degenerative joint disease after traumatic haemarthroses in one (2%). The bleeding time (BT) was prolonged in 83%, and the ristocetin cofactor (vW:RCoF) and factor VIII (FVIII:C) decreased in 64% and 43%, respectively. Haemarthroses and haematoma formation were associated with a longer activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (P?<?0.05), and anaemia with a lower FVIII:C (P?<?0.05). In 81%, a haemostatic response occurred with 1-8 deamino-d-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP), although, in 13%, surgical intervention was also required to achieve haemostasis. Postoperative bleeding could have been avoided in 89%, if a preoperative past bleeding history or family history had been obtained, and, in at least 94%, if a preoperative BT and APTT had also been performed. The failure to avoid postoperative bleeding and related complications in patients with vWD by taking a personal and family bleeding history constitutes a major public health problem.

AB  - Summary Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affects 1% pregnancies and is multi-factorial in origin. The role of the acquired thrombophilia antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) as a common and potentially treatable cause of RPL is well established but this is less so for inherited thrombophilia. In obstetric APS the combination of aspirin and heparin has improved outcomes. By analogy, the use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has become commonplace in women with inherited thrombophilia and also those with unexplained miscarriage to help safeguard the pregnancy. This review will examine the pathophysiological role of thrombophilia in pregnancy loss, and the evidence for anticoagulant-based intervention. The limited data supporting the use of heparin for women with RPL and inherited thrombophilia suggests adoption of a more cautious and judicious approach in this setting.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of the study was to investigate the presence of serum antibodies to different Leptospira serogroups in dogs with a clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis in southern Germany and to compare seroreactivity to different serogroups with history, clinical signs, laboratory findings and survival rate. Methods: In this study, the data of 42 dogs with the diagnosis of leptospirosis were evaluated retrospectively. Dogs were presented to the Small Animal Medicine Teaching Hospital (Medizinische Kleintierklinik) of the Ludwig Maximilians University Munich, Germany, between 1990 to 2003. Results: Reactivity to the serogroup grippotyphosa (13/42) was most frequently present, followed by reactivity to the serogroup saxkoebing (10/42). There was no difference in the clinical picture and the laboratory changes between dogs whose sera were reactive to different serogroups. Clinical Significance: Most of the dogs with leptospirosis in southern Germany had sera reacting to serogroups other than icterohaemorrhagiae and canicola, which are contained in the vaccine. Thus, currently available vaccines in Europe do not protect against the most common Leptospira organisms associated with clinical disease.

AB  - When the pulp of a tooth is irreversibly inflamed or necrotic and the apex is open, conventional root canal treatment is difficult to perform and the outcome is uncertain. Traditionally, the apexification procedure has consisted of multiple and long-term applications of calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] to create an apical barrier to aid the obturation. Recently, artificial apical barriers such as those made with mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) have been used in teeth with necrotic pulps and open apices. More recently, procedures referred to as regenerative endodontics have received much attention as an option for these teeth. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive literature review from May 1952?May 2011 regarding the management of teeth with necrotic pulps and open apices. This review covers the articles published in dental journals and book chapters regarding the definition, history, materials used, animal and human studies, mechanisms of action, prognosis, as well as advantages and disadvantages of apexification, apical plugs, and regenerative endodontics.

AB  - The authors have developed a CDS by culturing fibroblasts on the two-layered spongy matrix of hyaluronic acid (HA) and atelo-collagen (Col). This CDS is designed to promote wound healing by synergistic effect of fibroblasts and matrix. Both HA and Col molecules seem to function biologically in the process of wound healing. HA molecules play a critical role in several cellular functions such as migration and proliferation by promoting adhesion and disadhesion between the cell and the tissue substrate. Besides providing structural support and strength to the new tissue, Col molecules have a profound effect on the cells within and on its matrix. Col and Col-derived peptides act as chemoattractants for fibroblasts in vitro and may have a similar activity in vivo. Fibroblasts seeded on the Col surface of two-layered spongy matrix were found to attach, proliferate, and release vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as well as fibronectin. The cryopreserved CDS was found to keep the original potency to release VEGF after thawing followed by re-culturing. Multi-center's clinical research using allogeneic CDS has been proceeded as a national millennium project for regenerative medicine. These products are able to be stored in a freezer and transported to other hospitals in a frozen state. The clinical evaluation involving 180 cases has been already conducted using allogeneic cryopreserved CDS at 30 hospitals across Japan since April 2001. The results obtained in our clinical study suggest that this type of allogeneic CDS is able to provide an effective therapy for patients with severe full-thickness skin defects. These excellent clinical evaluations seem to be closely related to the results obtained in this fundamental study, especially related to the potency of cryopreserved allogeneic CDS to release VEGF and fibronectin.

AB  - Abstract It is possible to discuss the role that Ca++ antagonists might provide as a therapeutic means of treating various types of cerebral dysfunction, by maintaining a dynamic homeostasis of Ca++ in brain neurons. In this paper, we will review the results of Ca++ antagonist treatments of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage, stroke, migraine, dementia, psychiatric disorders, substance abusers, Menière's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and discuss the future of Ca++ antagonists and problems in their development. Ca++ antagonists have been established as a standard therapy for SAH in the USA, but their efficacy for traumatic SAH has not been confirmed because of the pathological variability of this disease. The data on strokes have not always indicated improved outcomes. Dementia may be a disease for which Ca++ antagonists should be indicated. Many clinical studies have also suggested some effectiveness of Ca++ antagonists, but the number of patients examined was too small to draw any firm conclusions. Thus, the development of Ca++ antagonists to treat cerebral dysfunction is not as greatly advanced as would be expected. This is probably due to the fact that most of the currently used Ca++ antagonists were selected on the basis of their cardiovascular effects, but not their effects on the central nervous system. ? 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Aims: Limited remyelination is a key feature of demyelinating Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis (TME). It is hypothesized that a dysregulation of differentiation of oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPCs) represents the main cause of insufficient regeneration in this model of multiple sclerosis. Methods: TME virus (TMEV)-infected SJL/J mice were evaluated by footprint analysis, light and electron microscopy, immunohistology, confocal immunofluorescence and RT-qPCR at multiple time points ranging from 1?h to 196?days post infection (dpi). Results: Footprint analysis revealed a significantly decreased stride length at 147 and 196?dpi. Demyelination progressively increased from 14 towards 196?dpi. A mild amount of remyelination was detected at 147 and 196?dpi. Early onset axonal injury was detected from 14?dpi on. TMEV RNA was detectable throughout the observation period and markedly increased between 7 and 28?dpi. Intralesional nerve/glial antigen 2 (NG2)-positive OPCs were temporarily increased between 28 and 98?dpi. Similarly, a transient upregulation of NG2 and platelet-derived growth factor α-receptor mRNA was noticed. In contrast, intralesional 2?,3?-cyclic nucleotide 3?-phosphodiesterase (CNPase)-positive oligodendrocytes were decreased between 56 and 196?dpi. Although CNPase mRNA remained unchanged, myelin basic protein mRNA and especially its exon 2 containing splice variants were decreased. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes and GFAP mRNA were increased in the late phase of TME. A mildly increased colocalization of both NG2/CNPase and NG2/GFAP was revealed at 196?dpi. Conclusions: Summarized, the present results indicated a dysregulation of OPC maturation as the main cause for the delayed and limited remyelination in TME. A shift of OPC differentiation from oligodendroglial towards astrocytic differentiation is postulated.

AB  - Lorazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine that interacts with a high degree of affinity for the GABA receptor complex. This high affinity binding in turn leads to a prolonged duration of action. There are no published clinical studies documenting its duration of action in dogs or its ability to control seizures. The purpose of this study was to compare the duration of seizure control of lorazepam with diazepam in 16 dogs presenting in status epilepticus or with active cluster seizures. Previous seizure history and anticonvulsant therapy was not a consideration for inclusion into this study. Animals were excluded if there was a known metabolic, toxic or traumatic cause of the seizure. Dogs were randomly assigned to receive either lorazepam (0.2?mg/kg IV) or diazepam (0.5?mg/kg IV), and the clinicians were blinded as to which drug they were administering. The duration of the study was 12 hours from the time of drug administration, and the animals were monitored for any indication of seizure activity, including generalized motor activity, focal motor activity (e.g., movement of facial or limb musculature) and change in the level of consciousness. The study ended at 12 hours post-study drug administration or when the dog seized before the end of the 12 hour study period. The results indicated no significant difference between lorazepam versus diazepam with regard to median seizure-free interval (2.8?h for diazepam versus 3.4?h for lorazepam, p=0.58 by log rank test), or with regard to percent seizure-free for the duration of the observation period (1/8 for lorazepam versus 3/8 for diazepam, p=0.51 by Fisher's exact test). There was also no difference between the 2 drugs regarding the number of animals in which seizures were initially controlled (6/8 in each group). Lorazepam used at this dose does not appear to result in a significant increase in duration of seizure control for dogs with status epilepticus and cluster seizures. Additional studies may be warranted using higher doses of lorazepam.

Both dogs suffered from anaemia caused by chronic intestinal blood loss, vomiting and weight loss. In both cases, there was no response to conservative medical management. Eventually, the dogs suffered significant gastrointestinal haemorrhage that resulted in collapse. Gastroduodenoscopy and exploratory surgery showed a duodenal diverticulum in both dogs. This is the first report that describes this congenital anomaly in two siblings.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: No large scale equine microarray is available commercially to allow genomic and transcriptional profiling of the majority of genes that would define the genetic basis of equine disease. Objectives: To generate a whole transcript target labelled GeneChip to interrogate the equine transcriptome and validate chip performance using RNA samples derived from organs, articular cells and normal cartilage. Methods: Equine mRNA and selected equine gene sequences derived from perfect cross-hybridisation of equine RNA on human microarray GeneChips, were used to design a custom equine gene microarray. Sequence data were used as a template for generation of a glass-slide based 5?-3? multiexon-encompassing gene chip. The microarray was characterised using RNA derived from organs including spleen, liver, brain and kidney, and RNA from cultured chondrocytes, cartilage, synovial tissue and stem cells, employing a whole transcript target labelling assay to sample mRNA across the 5?-3? spectrum. Results: The custom microarray simultaneously interrogated over 12,300 equine specific genes. Probing the chip with mixtures of total RNA derived from parenchymatous organs and articular tissues resulted in 61.7 and 62.8% present calls, respectively. This gene chip provided expression information on up to 90% of the key molecules in important signalling, metabolic and development pathways. Cartilage specific matrix genes were abundantly expressed in normal articular cartilage, but surprisingly high levels of collagen types I, III, V and XI, reflected expression from the epiphyseal layers of maturing articular epiphyseal cartilage. Conclusion: An oligonucleotide microarray with over 12,300 probe sets was generated by uniquely combining a labelling strategy incorporating expressed sequence tags from the entire transcriptome and supplementing selected human sequences that cross-hybridised with the horse. Validation showed robust performance of the microarray. Potential relevance: This array may be a useful tool to elucidate the pathogenesis of equine diseases.

Nevertheless, there are several important areas of controversy with regard to the surgical approach, differences of which may impact the rate of success and the incidence of adverse effects. Cognitive sequelae of temporal lobe surgery may result from (1) resection or transgression of the lateral (neocortical) temporal lobe or the temporal stem, which may lead to impairment in learning, and/or (2) resection of mesial structures, which may lead to decline in material-specific memory. The recent multi-center clinical trial analyzing the predictors of post-surgical quality-of-life will be discussed, including the finding that improvement depends on seizure-freedom irrespective of the occurrence of verbal memory decline. Nevertheless, it is incumbent on surgeons to minimize the occurrence of these cognitive sequelae while maximizing the possibility of seizure-freedom. Several approaches to gain access to the mesial structures will be compared with regard to cognitive outcome, including anterior temporal lobectomy (standard vs. tailored), trans-cortical selective AH and trans-sylvian selective AH, which differ in terms of their disruption of the temporal neocortex and temporal stem. Alternative approaches to the mesial resection will be compared with regard to seizure-free rates and the incidence of post-surgical decline in memory, including tailoring the hippocampal resection to the presence of inter-ictal epileptic spikes vs. performing a standardized resection, and the influence of the amount of hippocampal tissue resected. Open discussion of recent results addressing these important issues will hopefully either propel the field towards consensus, or highlight the need for further randomized clinical trials to improve patient outcome following amygdalo-hippocampectomy for MTLE.

AB  - Implication of Pigment Cell Biology for Understanding Human Diseases was the topic of the The Sixth Annual Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center: Carcinogenesis and Cancer Prevention conference, jointly sponsored by the University of California Irvine College of Medicine and the PanAmerican Society of Pigment Cell Research This was a multi-disciplinary, three-and-one-half day conference for basic science and clinical investigators. The overall objectives of the meeting were to expand ideas, approaches, and collaborations for members of the society by bringing together experts in disciplines relevant to pigment cell research and associated diseases such as melanoma, albinoism, vitiligo, and other diseases of pigment cells. The meeting focused on recent developments in the genetics, novel gene function, gene expression pattern, and post-transcriptional processing of melanocyte specific proteins, melanosome function, melanin structure, and implications of recent basic advances for understanding human pigmentary diseases. These areas have been particularly productive due to recent breakthroughs and rapid progress in microarray gene expression, mass spectrometry, atomic force microscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and other physical chemical and molecular biotechnologies.

AB  - Fibroblast migration from the peri-wound collagenous stroma into the fibrin-laden wound is critical for granulation tissue formation and subsequent healing. Previously we found that fibroblast transmigration from a collagen matrix into a fibrin matrix required the presence of fibronectin (FN). Several cell surface receptors, namely integrins α4?1, α5?1 and αv?3 were also required for this invasive migration. Here we demonstrated that syndecan-4, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan, known to bind FN at the highly cationic HepII domain is also required for fibroblast invasive migration of a fibrin/FN gel. This conclusion was based on fibroblast migration using two independent means of disrupting syndecan-4: heparinase degradation of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans or suppression of syndecan-4 core protein with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. Isolated syndecan-4 from these fibroblasts bound the Hep II recombinant constructs FN III12?15v?>?FN III12?15?>?FN III12?14 but did not bind the alternatively spliced IIICs (V) domain. Furthermore, we found that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which is required to stimulate fibroblast migration, markedly increased cell levels of syndecan-4 core protein in a time and dose dependent fashion. PDGF also induced up-regulation of syndecan-4 at transcriptional level as determined by RT-PCR. These results demonstrate that syndecan-4 is essential for fibroblast invasive migration into fibrin clot and that PDGF, the stimulus for migration, induces increased syndecan-4 core protein expression.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aim Current understanding of specific, therapeutic procedure-associated complications in pediatric patients remains limited. This study aims to determine the frequency of significant complications in pediatric age-range subjects following the principal therapeutic endoscopic procedures. Methods This study used retrospective multi-institutional, ICD-9-CM, Clinical Transaction Classification, and Current Procedural Terminology based database (Pediatric Hospital Information System) analysis. This study included demographic, chronic comorbidity, procedure type, and post-procedure outcomes defined through mortality, unplanned direct admission, emergency room, and inpatient admission and inpatient therapeutic events. Results During the study period, 18 018 patients underwent therapeutic endoscopy; 132 required direct (0.16%) or emergency room/inpatient (0.58%) admission within 5 days following the procedure; mortality was 0.01%. Most (50.75%) complications presented on the day of or 1 day post-procedure. Hispanic race and coexisting chronic comorbidities, especially gastrointestinal conditions, were identified risk factors for significant complications. Endoscopic dilatation and variceal ablation were most frequently associated with complications. Abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, and esophageal stricture were the most common diagnoses: 9.0% required intravenous antibiotics, 36.63% underwent chest imaging, 27.27% abdominal imaging, and 0.75% required blood transfusion. Readmission following esophageal dilatation was most likely to result in prolonged admission. Conclusion In the pediatric population undergoing therapeutic endoscopy in the ambulatory setting, significant postoperative complications resulting in unplanned admission are rare. Complications can be anticipated in medically frail patients especially with gastrointestinal chronic illness. Procedures involving variceal ablation and esophageal dilatation entail the highest risk.

AB  - Summary Equine strongyles have been shown to induce alterations in both mesenteric blood flow and also intestinal motility patterns. Both of these pathophysiological events might play a role in the pathogenesis of colic and it is likely that they are interrelated. The prevalence of strongyle-associated colic is difficult to ascertain: non-strangulating infarction is uncommon but many other colic episodes may be induced by strongyle infections. In controlled studies and in clinical accounts worm control programmes have resulted in a reduced prevalence of colic. Current options for adequate control of equine strongyles are: interval anthelmintic treatments; strategic anthelmintic treatments; selective anthelmintic treatments; daily in-feed treatments and pasture hygiene.

AB  - Abstract Seven days after the injection of different concentrations of thrombin into the nigrostriatal pathway, a strong macrophage/microglial reaction was observed in the substantia nigra (SN), indicated by immunostaining, using OX-42 and OX-6 antibodies, and by the induction of iNOS, IL-1α, Il-1? and TNF-α. Moreover, selective damage to dopaminergic neurones was produced after thrombin injection, evidenced by loss of tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining and tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA-expressing cell bodies, and the unaltered transcription of glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNA in the SN and striatum. These thrombin effects could be produced by its ability to induce the activation of microglia described in in vitro studies, and are in agreement with the effects described for other proinflammatory compounds. Thrombin effects are produced by its biological activity since they almost disappeared when thrombin was heat-inactivated or injected along with its inhibitor α-NAPAP. Thrombin is a multi-functional serine protease rapidly produced from prothrombin at the sites of tissue injury, and also upon breakdown of the blood?brain barrier, which strongly suggests it could easily enter into the CNS. These results could have special importance in some degenerative processes of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system.

AB  - Left displaced abomasum (LDA) and abomasal volvulus (AV) occur most commonly in postparturient dairy cows. Our main hypothesis was that endotoxemia occurred more frequently in the peripheral blood of cows with LDA or AV than in healthy cows because increased luminal pressure in AV or LDA, or the presence of a hemorrhagic strangulating obstruction in AV, may have injured the abomasal mucosa, thereby facilitating translocation of luminal endotoxin into the circulation. Therefore, our main objective was to compare the prevalence and magnitude of endotoxemia in healthy postparturient cows with the prevalence and magnitude of endotoxemia in cows with AV and LDA. We examined 60 adult dairy cows in early lactation that were diagnosed with AV (n = 15) or LDA (n = 15) or were healthy on physical examination (control group, n = 30). Jugular venous blood was obtained from cows in all 3 groups, and right gastroepiploic venous blood was obtained during surgical correction of AV and LDA immediately after repositioning of the abomasum. Platelet-rich plasma endotoxin concentrations were measured with a chromogenic limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. Endotoxin was detected in jugular vein plasma in 50% (15/30) of control cows; however, the prevalence of endotoxemia was significantly lower (P < .05) in cows with AV (7%, 1/15) or LDA (20%, 3/15). Endotoxin was detected simultaneously in right gastroepiploic and jugular vein plasma in only 1 cow with LDA and 0 cows with AV. Contrary to our hypothesis, we conclude that endotoxemia is infrequently present in postparturient dairy cows with AV or LDA.
