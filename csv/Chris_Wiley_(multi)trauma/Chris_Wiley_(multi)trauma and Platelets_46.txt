AB  - Abstract Seven days after the injection of different concentrations of thrombin into the nigrostriatal pathway, a strong macrophage/microglial reaction was observed in the substantia nigra (SN), indicated by immunostaining, using OX-42 and OX-6 antibodies, and by the induction of iNOS, IL-1α, Il-1? and TNF-α. Moreover, selective damage to dopaminergic neurones was produced after thrombin injection, evidenced by loss of tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining and tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA-expressing cell bodies, and the unaltered transcription of glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNA in the SN and striatum. These thrombin effects could be produced by its ability to induce the activation of microglia described in in vitro studies, and are in agreement with the effects described for other proinflammatory compounds. Thrombin effects are produced by its biological activity since they almost disappeared when thrombin was heat-inactivated or injected along with its inhibitor α-NAPAP. Thrombin is a multi-functional serine protease rapidly produced from prothrombin at the sites of tissue injury, and also upon breakdown of the blood?brain barrier, which strongly suggests it could easily enter into the CNS. These results could have special importance in some degenerative processes of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system.

AB  - Left displaced abomasum (LDA) and abomasal volvulus (AV) occur most commonly in postparturient dairy cows. Our main hypothesis was that endotoxemia occurred more frequently in the peripheral blood of cows with LDA or AV than in healthy cows because increased luminal pressure in AV or LDA, or the presence of a hemorrhagic strangulating obstruction in AV, may have injured the abomasal mucosa, thereby facilitating translocation of luminal endotoxin into the circulation. Therefore, our main objective was to compare the prevalence and magnitude of endotoxemia in healthy postparturient cows with the prevalence and magnitude of endotoxemia in cows with AV and LDA. We examined 60 adult dairy cows in early lactation that were diagnosed with AV (n = 15) or LDA (n = 15) or were healthy on physical examination (control group, n = 30). Jugular venous blood was obtained from cows in all 3 groups, and right gastroepiploic venous blood was obtained during surgical correction of AV and LDA immediately after repositioning of the abomasum. Platelet-rich plasma endotoxin concentrations were measured with a chromogenic limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. Endotoxin was detected in jugular vein plasma in 50% (15/30) of control cows; however, the prevalence of endotoxemia was significantly lower (P < .05) in cows with AV (7%, 1/15) or LDA (20%, 3/15). Endotoxin was detected simultaneously in right gastroepiploic and jugular vein plasma in only 1 cow with LDA and 0 cows with AV. Contrary to our hypothesis, we conclude that endotoxemia is infrequently present in postparturient dairy cows with AV or LDA.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the feasibility of CT pulmonary angiography for identification of naturally occurring pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs using predefined diagnostic criteria and to assess the ability of echocardiography, cardiac troponins, D-dimers and kaolin-activated thromboelastography to predict the presence of pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs. Methods Twelve dogs with immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia and evidence of respiratory distress were prospectively evaluated. Dogs were sedated immediately before CT pulmonary angiography using intravenous butorphanol. Spiral CT pulmonary angiography was performed with a 16 detector-row CT scanner using a pressure injector to infuse contrast media through peripheral intravenous catheters. Pulmonary thromboembolism was diagnosed using predefined criteria. Contemporaneous tests included echocardiography, arterial blood gas analysis, kaolin-activated thromboelastography, D-dimers and cardiac troponins. Results Based on predefined criteria, four dogs were classified as pulmonary thromboembolism positive, three dogs were suspected to have pulmonary thromboembolism and the remaining five dogs had negative scans. The four dogs identified with pulmonary thromboembolism all had discrete filling defects in main or lobar pulmonary arteries. None of the contemporaneous tests was discriminant for pulmonary thromboembolism diagnosis, although the small sample size was limiting. Clinical Significance CT pulmonary angiography can be successfully performed in dogs under sedation, even in at-risk patients with respiratory distress and can both confirm and rule out pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs.

AB  - The addition of hydrosurgery into our surgical armamentarium will aim to revolutionize surgical wound debridement. Hydrosurgery (Versajet1) utilizes a high pressure fine saline jet delivered via a compact hand-piece to debride, irrigate and remove debri simultaneously. The hydrosurgery system is minimally invasive enabling debridement at the bedside, with minimal haemorrhage and analgesic requirements2. Its applications range from debridement of traumatic and non-traumatic wounds (acute and chronic), wound lavage, debridement of variable thickness burns, wound bed preparation prior to skin grafting, and flap recontouring. Complex infected wounds (necrotising fasciitis) may also be debrided with potential maximal preservation of adjacent neurovasculature and viable tissues. We present five cases involving the use of the Versajet for the debridement of three diabetic foot wounds, one venous ulcer, and one traumatic chest wound. All hydro-debridements were performed at the bedside with an average procedure time of 23 minutes (15?40 minutes), an average analgesic requirement of 10?mg morphine (5?15?mg), and with minimal encountered blood losses (including two patients on Coumarin). Only a single ward debridement procedure was required to achieve a healthy wound bed in all five patients. The Versajet enables debridement and wound bed preparation that is efficient, minimally invasive, and cost effective with reductions in hospital stay.

AB  - There is an increasing number of inherited disorders in which excessive telomere shortening underlies the molecular defect, with dyskeratosis congenita (DC) being the archetypal short telomere syndrome. DC is classically described as a mucocutaneous triad of oral leukoplakia, nail dystrophy and abnormal skin pigmentation. However, excessive telomere shortening can affect almost any organ system, so the clinical manifestations are protean, including developmental delay, cerebellar hypoplasia, exudative retinopathy, aplastic anaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, idiopathic hepatic cirrhosis, head and neck cancer and dental abnormalities, and may be multi-systemic. Undiagnosed patients may be seen by essentially any medical subspecialist. Correct diagnosis is important to ensure appropriate management, and for initiating investigations to identify affected family members. Treatment is often supportive, with transplantation offering cure for pulmonary fibrosis or bone marrow failure. Higher rates of mortality and morbidity with transplantation often require regimen alterations, underscoring the need for correct diagnosis. Short telomeres result from mutations in genes essential for telomere maintenance (e.g. genes encoding subunits of the telomerase enzyme complex). Disease severity reflects not only the severity of the defect, but also the inheritance of short telomeres, giving rise to incomplete penetrance and genetic anticipation. Attendees of the inaugural Australian Short Telomere Syndrome Conference were updated on the current scientific and clinical understanding of these disorders, and discussed the best approach for management of these patients in the Australian context. This review will include recommendations from the conference and aims to increase awareness of short telomere disorders.

AB  - Summary Ureteral stent placement for the management of malignant ureteral obstructions has been a mainstay of palliative treatment for humans with non-resectable tumors to preserve renal function. Ureteral stents have also been placed preoperatively for patient stabilization prior to surgical intervention. Urothelial neoplasia in dogs is often complicated by local tumor invasion and obstruction of the urethra, ureters, or both. Nephrostomy tube placement or hemodialysis can provide temporary relief, but radical surgeries have traditionally been the only viable alternative for long-term management in veterinary patients. This chapter describes the placement of a double pigtail ureteral stent as a minimally invasive, long-term treatment option for malignant obstructive neoplasia in dogs and cats. The author has also used this technique in a small number of feline patients with malignant obstructions, though the subcutaneous ureteral bypass (SUB) device is generally preferred in cats.

AB  - (Headache 2011;51:208-219) Objective.? Intimate partner violence (IPV) among women is a global public health problem. The association between childhood maltreatment and migraine is well established, but not the association between IPV and migraine. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the relationship between type and severity of IPV and migraine in a large cohort of Peruvian women. Methods.? Women who delivered singleton infants (n?=?2066) at the Instituto Nacional Materno Perinatal, Lima, Peru were interviewed during their postpartum hospital stay. Participants were queried about their lifetime experiences with headaches and migraine, and with physical and sexual violence. The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-2) diagnostic criteria were used to classify participants according to their migraine status. Questions on physical and sexual violence were adapted from the protocol of Demographic Health Survey Questionnaires and Modules: Domestic Violence Module and the World Health Organization (WHO) Multi-Country Study on Violence against Women. Depressive symptoms were assessed using a modified version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Logistic regression was used to estimate multivariate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results.? Compared with women without a history of violence, women with experiences of lifetime physical or sexual violence (aOR?=?1.44, 95% CI 1.19-1.75), physical violence only (aOR?=?1.36, 95% CI 1.10-1.68), sexual violence only (aOR?=?1.76, 95% CI 0.97-3.21), and both physical and sexual violence (aOR?=?1.61, 95% CI 1.12-2.31) had increased odds of any migraine after adjusting for maternal age, parity, and access to basic foods. There was no gradient of increased odds of any migraine with severity of physical violence. The relationship between IPV and any migraine was strongest among women with moderate to severe levels of depressive symptoms. The odds of any migraine was increased 2.25-fold (95% CI 1.75-2.28) among abused women who also had moderate to severe levels of depressive symptomology compared with women who were not abused and had none or mild levels of depressive symptomology. Associations from sensitivity analyze that segregated women according to probable migraine (ICHD-2 category 1.6.1) and migraine (ICHD-2 category 1.1) diagnoses were of similar magnitudes as those reported here for women with any migraine diagnoses. IPV, particularly sexual violence, appears to be a risk factor for migraine. Conclusion.? Our findings suggest the potential importance of considering a history of violence among migraineurs.

AB  - The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) sponsored a May 2002 workshop on gene-environment interaction (G ? E) research to identify potential roadblocks to further research and to propose solutions to those roadblocks, to optimize investigative opportunities and multidisciplinary or multi-institution collaborations, and to explore ways that NIAAA can facilitate G ? E studies. Sessions included panels on animal models; phenotypes; genetic findings in humans; study designs and analytical methods; and assessment of environmental risk. Key among the identified challenges to progress in G ? E research were issues of study design and sampling strategies; logistic and methodological costs and constraints; availability and understanding of data analysis techniques; potential stigmatization of study populations; and organizational/bureaucratic structures that are inadequate to address the unique needs of large-scale, multicenter, longitudinal projects.

AB  - Abstract l-citrulline is a naturally occurring non-essential amino acid, an intermediate in urea cycle and conditionally essential in intestinal pathology. It is a potent hydroxyl radical scavenger and much more effective precursor of arginine and nitric oxide (NO) than arginine itself so exploited in therapeutics. Plasma citrulline concentration is used by clinicians to assess functional enterocyte mass in various chronic and acute small bowel pathologies like short bowel syndrome that has become an indication in clinical practice. Its supplementation is likely to be used in conditions like erectile dysfunction, sickle cell anemia, short bowel syndrome (to restore nitrogen balance), hyperlipidemia, cancer chemotherapy, hypercholestremia, in hyperoxic lung damage, urea cycle disorders, Alzheimers disease, multi-infarct dementia and as an immunomodulator. Its emerging role as a biomarker in intestinal pathology and early diagnosis of Rheumatoid arthritis has spread considerable interest. Antibody detection to Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (ACCP) antibodies can be recommended for early detection of RA decreasing joint damage and deformity, because these are detected well before the onset of disease manifestations of RA. The test is highly specific than RF (Rheumatoid factor), with moderate sensitivity, but much useful in differentiating RA from other disorders. Further studies and exploration is required in these areas.

AB  - Objective To describe a case of diabetes mellitus in a koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). Design A case report with controls. Procedures We describe clinical and laboratory findings in a 6-year-old, free-living, female koala presented with traumatic injury and subsequently found to have polydipsia, hyperglycaemia and glucosuria. Over a 5 week period, serum biochemical analyses, haematological examinations, urinal-yses, measurement of serum insulin and fructosamine concentrations, necropsy, histopathological examination of a range of tissues and immunohistochemical examination of the pancreas for insulin-containing cells were done. For reference purposes, serum insulin and fructosamine concentrations were determined in four and two healthy koalas, respectively, and three healthy koalas pancreases were examined histo-logically and immunohistochemically. Results The koala had persistent hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia, hyponatraemia, hypochloraemia and glucosuria. Serum insulin concentration of the diabetic koala was only marginally smaller than that of healthy koalas, but all concentrations were smaller than reference concentrations in dogs and people. Fructosamine concentration did not allow the diabetic koala to be distinguished from healthy koalas and concentrations of all koala analytes were greater than expected for healthy dogs and people. Histopathological examination revealed extensive degeneration of pancreatic islet cells and fatty infiltration of hepatocytes. Immunoperoxidase staining revealed decreased or absent insulin in the b cells of the affected koala. Conclusion Clinical signs, clinicopathological results and histopathological changes were consistent with diabetes mellitus. The pathogenesis of the condition could not be determined but may have been related to the administration of a parenteral corticosteroid preparation, the stress of capture or tissue damage and inflammation.

AB  - A 12-week-old greyhound had a two-day history of lethargy, inappetence and shifting lameness. Clinical examination revealed pyrexia and hepatosplenomegaly. Haematological examination showed anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and large numbers of atypical mononuclear leucocytes. A diagnosis of acute B cell lymphoblastic leukaemia was made following flow cytometric immunophenotyping of the leucocytes. The owner declined further evaluation and the dog was treated symptomatically with antibiotics. After a brief improvement, the dog's condition deteriorated and it was euthanased four days after initial presentation. The case was unusual because acute lymphoid leukaemia in the dog is most frequently reported in mature animals. This is in contrast to humans, where acute leukaemia is one of the most common childhood cancers.

AB  - Baclofen, a GABA agonist, is frequently used to treat muscle spasticity due to spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. Baclofen overdose can lead to coma, respiratory depression, hyporeflexia, and flaccidity. Because baclofen is primarily excreted unchanged through the kidneys, it should be given with caution, and it may be necessary to reduce the dosage.Signs of overdose may appear suddenly or insidiously. Acute massive overdose may present as coma. Less sudden and/or less severe forms of overdose may present with signs of CNS depression, excessive salivation, dizziness, nausea and/or vomiting, somnolence, and hypotonia. Should overdose appear likely, the patient should be taken immediately to a hospital. A 46-year-old man, who was treated by intermittent hemodialysis (three times a week), was admitted to our unit for signs of CNS depression, dizziness, vomiting, somnolence, and hypotonia. He was treated at the relatively low dose of baclofen, 5?mg/day, because of muscle spasticity due to spinal cord injury. His temperature was 37?°C, and predialysis laboratory data were hemoglobin 11.4?g/dl, white blood cells 6550/mm3 with normal differential count, and platelets 330000/mm3. Serum sodium was 134?mmol/l, potassium 6.4?mmom/l, bicarbonate 18.3?mmol/l, urea 30?mmol/l, creatinine 998??mol/l, glucose 5.16?mmol/l, and calcium level 2.4?mmol/l. Serum transaminases were normal. A brain computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no abnormalities. Baclofen-associated encephalopathy was considered to be the most likely etiology for this acute neurological picture. Baclofen was then stopped. Plasma concentration of baclofen was >600?ng/ml (therapeutic range 80?400?ng/ml) after 2 hours of hemodialysis and the baclofen level rapidly fell (<200?ng/ml) at the end of the hemodialysis session. After the first 4-h haemodialysis session, there was an incomplete recovery of the neurological status. After a renewed hemodialysis session the symptoms completely receded.The patient was discharged from the hospital 72?h later in a good condition. Patients with severely impaired renal function generally develop baclofen intoxication soon after the initiation of low-dose therapy. Thus, the administration of baclofen, regardless of the dosage, in these patients is not appropriate.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are non-hematopoietic multi-potent stem-like cells that are capable of differentiating into both mesenchymal and non-mesenchymal lineages. In fact, in addition to bone, cartilage, fat, and myoblasts, it has been demonstrated that MSCs are capable of differentiating into neurons and astrocytes in vitro and in vivo. MSCs are of interest because they are isolated from a small aspirate of bone marrow and can be easily expanded in vitro. As such, these cells are currently being tested for their potential use in cell and gene therapy for a number of human diseases. Nevertheless, there are still some open questions about origin, multipotentiality, and anatomical localization of MSCs. In this review, we discuss clinical trials based on the use of MSCs in cardiovascular diseases, such as treatment of acute myocardial infarction, endstage ischemic heart disease, or prevention of vascular restenosis through stem cell-mediated injury repair. We analyze data from clinical trials for treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), which is a genetic disease characterized by production of defective type I collagen. We describe progress for neurological disease treatment with MSC transplants. We discuss data on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and on lysosomal storage diseases (Hurler syndrome and metachromatic leukodystrophy). A section of review is dedicated to ongoing clinical trials, involving MSCs in treatment of steroid refractory Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD); periodontitis, which is a chronic disease affecting periodontium and causing destruction of attachment apparatus, heart failure, and bone fractures. Finally, we will provide information about biotech companies developing MSC therapy. J. Cell. Physiol. 211: 27?35, 2007. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to treat signs of endotoxaemia by inhibiting cyclo-oxygenases (COX). COX-1 is expressed constitutively and promotes gut barrier function, whereas COX-2 is inducible and contributes to the signs of endotoxaemia. In preclinical SISO trials, intestinal barrier recovery was more complete with reductions in endotoxin permeability in horses treated with COX-2 selective NSAIDs as compared with horses treated with flunixin meglumine. Objectives We hypothesised that treatment of post-surgical SISO horses with firocoxib (COX-2 selective) would reduce the signs of endotoxaemia to a greater extent than flunixin meglumine (nonselective COX inhibitor) while continuing to provide similar levels of pain control. Study design Blinded randomised clinical trial. Methods In addition to clinical monitoring, preoperative and 12-, 24- and 48-h post-operative plasma samples were assessed for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), thromboxane B2 (TXB2), TNF? and soluble CD14 (sCD14). Results In 56 recruited SISO horses, either flunixin meglumine (1.1 mg/kg, i.v., q12h) or firocoxib (0.3 mg/kg, i.v. loading dose; 0.1 mg/kg, i.v., q24h) was given in the post-operative period in three university hospitals from 2015 to 2017. COX-2 selectivity was confirmed by a relative lack of inhibition of the COX-1 prostanoid TXB2 by firocoxib and significant inhibition by flunixin meglumine (P = 0.014). Both drugs inhibited the COX-2 prostanoid PGE2. There were no significant differences in pain scores between groups (P = 0.2). However, there was a 3.23-fold increased risk (P = 0.04) of increased plasma sCD14 in horses treated with flunixin meglumine, a validated biomarker of equine endotoxaemia. Main limitations Horses were all treated with flunixin meglumine prior to referral. In addition, many horses were treated with lidocaine, which has been shown to mitigate the deleterious effects of flunixin meglumine. Conclusions In SISO cases, firocoxib reduced a biomarker of endotoxaemia as compared with flunixin meglumine while continuing to provide similar levels of pain control.

AB  - Abstract Anal incontinence is a devastating condition that significantly reduces the quality of life. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of human adipose stem cell (hASC) injections in a rat model for anal sphincter injury, which is the main cause of anal incontinence in humans. Furthermore, we tested if the efficacy of hASCs could be improved by combining them with polyacrylamide hydrogel carrier, Bulkamid. Human ASCs derived from a female donor were culture expanded in DMEM/F12 supplemented with human platelet lysate. Female virgin Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into four groups (n?=?14?15/group): hASCs in saline or Bulkamid (3 ? 105/60 ?l) and saline or Bulkamid without cells. Anorectal manometry (ARM) was performed before anal sphincter injury, at two (n?=?58) and at four weeks after (n?=?33). Additionally, the anal sphincter tissue was examined by micro-computed tomography (?CT) and the histological parameters were compared between the groups. The median resting and peak pressure during spontaneous contraction measured by ARM were significantly higher in hASC treatment groups compared with the control groups without hASCs. There was no statistical difference in functional results between the hASC-carrier groups (saline vs. Bulkamid). No difference was detected in the sphincter muscle continuation between the groups in the histology and ?CT analysis. More inflammation was discovered in the group receiving saline with hASC. The hASC injection therapy with both saline and Bulkamid is a promising nonsurgical treatment for acute anal sphincter injury. Traditional histology combined with the 3D ?CT image data lends greater confidence in assessing muscle healing and continuity. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2018;7:295?304

AB  - Abstract Background Chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP) remains a major clinical problem and is often refractory to current treatments. New analgesic medications and strategies for pain relief are needed. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is known to be a multi-functional growth factor and regulates various biological activities. Methods We investigated the analgesic effect and underlying mechanism of plasmid pUDK-HGF encoding human HGF gene on CPSP induced by skin/muscle incision and retraction (SMIR) in rats. The possible changes of inflammatory factors, glial cell activation and pain sensitivity after pUDK-HGF administration were investigated by ELISA, western blot and Von Frey tests, respectively. Results In behavioural assays, we found that a single intramuscular or intrathecal injection of pUDK-HGF significantly attenuated mechanical hypersensitivity to von Frey stimulation of plantar ipsilateral hind paw after SMIR. Intramuscular injection of pUDK-HGF promoted blood flow and proliferation of satellite cells and inhibited inflammatory cells recruitment, collagen accumulation and expression of pronociceptive factors. Intrathecal injection of pUDK-HGF inhibited activation of spinal glial cells and production of inflammatory mediators induced by SMIR. Conclusions pUDK-HGF has a strong analgesic potency and efficacy in CPSP induced by SMIR in rats. This study highlights a new strategy for the treatment of CPSP. Significance The CPSP occurs following various surgical procedures and remains a major clinical problem due to the lack of study on the mechanisms of CPSP. Our findings provide the first evidence that pUDK-HGF attenuates SMIR-induced pain behaviuors through peripheral or central mechanisms. The peripheral analgesic effect of pUDK-HGF is associated with promoting tissue repair and inhibiting inflammatory response; furthermore, pUDK-HGF inhibits activation of spinal glial cells and overexpression of inflammatory mediators in spinal cord. Therefore, naked pUDK-HGF may be a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment of CPSP in clinic.

AB  - Abstract Coronary artery disease is characterized by a narrowing (stenosis) of the arteries that supply blood to the tissue of the heart. Continued restriction of blood flow manifests itself as angina and ultimately myocardial infarction (heart attack) for the patient. Heart bypass was once the only treatment for this condition, but over the years percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has become an increasingly attractive alternative to medical therapy and surgical revascularization for the treatment of coronary artery disease. A vascular stent is a medical device designed to serve as a temporary or permanent internal scaffold, to maintain or increase the lumen of a blood vessel. Metallic coronary stents were first introduced to prevent arterial dissections and to eliminate vessel recoil and intimal hyperplasia associated with PCI. Further advancement in the treatment of coronary artery disease is the development of drug-eluting stents that dramatically reduce the incidence of in-stent restenosis to less than 5%. Local drug delivery offers the advantages of allowing a relatively high local concentration of drug at the treatment site while minimizing systemic toxic effect. This review describes approaches for prevention of restenosis. It focuses on drugs for prevention of restenosis, bare metal stents, and drug-eluting stents. It also describes recent advances in bioresorbable stents. One of the chapters is dedicated to our novel composite bioresorbable drug-eluting fibers, designed to be used as basic elements in drug-eluting stents. ? 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objective Analyze the cause and significance of a shift in the timing of free flap failures in head and neck reconstruction. Study Design Retrospective multi-institutional review of prospectively collected databases at tertiary care centers. Methods Included consecutive patients undergoing free flap reconstructions of head and neck defects between 2007 and 2017. Selected variables: demographics, defect location, donor site, free flap failure cause, social and radiation therapy history. Results Overall free flap failure rate was 4.6% (n = 133). Distribution of donor tissue by flap failure: radial forearm (32%, n = 43), osteocutaneous radial forearm (6%, n = 8), anterior lateral thigh (23%, n = 31), fibula (23%, n = 30), rectus abdominis (4%, n = 5), latissimus (11%, n = 14), scapula (1.5%, n = 2). Forty percent of flap failures occurred in the initial 72 hours following reconstruction (n = 53). The mean postoperative day for flap failure attributed to venous congestion was 4.7 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6?6.7) versus 6.8 days (CI 5.3?8.3) for arterial insufficiency and 16.6 days (CI 11.7?21.5) for infection (P <?.001). The majority of flap failures were attributed to compromise of the arterial or venous system (84%, n = 112). Factors found to affect the timing of free flap failure included surgical indication (P =?.032), defect location (P =?.006), cause of the flap failure (P <?.001), and use of an osteocutaneous flap (P =?.002). Conclusion This study is the largest to date on late free flap failures with findings suggesting a paradigm shift in the timing of flap failures. Surgical indication, defect site, cause of flap failure, and use of osteocutaneous free flap were found to impact timing of free flap failures. Level of Evidence 4 Laryngoscope, 130:347?353, 2020

AB  - Abstract The myeloproliferative neoplasms represent a diverse group of hematologic malignancies that have been the subject of intense investigation over the last decade. Although clinical trials of the much anticipated small molecule inhibitors of Janus kinase 2 have shown that these experimental agents are successful in palliating many of the symptoms associated with the myeloproliferative neoplasms, they have not been reported to affect the disease initiating hematopoietic stem cell population or to alter the natural history of these disorders. Investigators remain optimistic that new information about the genetic and cellular origins gained from the efforts of numerous laboratories will ultimately translate in to the identification of new drug targets and more effective therapies. We hypothesize that ultimately, the use of combinations of drugs including chromatin modifying agents, immunomodulatory agents, anti-apoptotic agents, cellular therapies and monoclonal antibodies will be required to effectively treat patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.

AB  - Background Extraparenchymal spinal cord hematoma has been described in veterinary medicine in association with neoplasia, intervertebral disk disease, and snake envenomation. There are rare reports of spontaneous extraparenchymal spinal cord hematoma formation with no known cause in human medicine. Multiple cases of spontaneous extraparenchymal spinal cord hematoma have not been described previously in veterinary medicine. Objectives To describe the signalment, clinical findings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, and surgical outcomes in histopathologically confirmed extraparenchymal spinal cord hematomas in dogs with no identified underlying etiology. Animals Six dogs had MRI of the spinal cord, decompressive spinal surgery, and histopathologic confirmation of extraparenchymal spinal cord hematoma not associated with an underlying cause. Methods Multi-institutional retrospective study. Results Six patients had spontaneous extraparenchymal spinal cord hematoma formation. MRI showed normal signal within the spinal cord parenchyma in all patients. All hematomas had T2-weighted hyperintensity and the majority (5/6) had no contrast enhancement. All dogs underwent surgical decompression and most patients (5/6) returned to normal or near normal neurologic function postoperatively. Follow-up of the patients (ranging between 921 and 1,446 days) showed no progression of neurologic clinical signs or any conditions associated with increased bleeding tendency. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Before surgery and histopathology confirming extraparenchymal hematoma, the primary differential in most cases was neoplasia, based on the MRI findings. This retrospective study reminds clinicians of the importance of the combination of advanced imaging combined with histopathologic diagnosis. The prognosis for spontaneous spinal cord extraparenchymal hematoma with surgical decompression appears to be favorable in most cases.
