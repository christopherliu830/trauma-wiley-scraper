The therapeutic benefits of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for the promotion of healing and regeneration of periodontal tissues are thought to result from enrichment in growth factors released from platelets. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of specific growth factors released from PRP on endothelial cell proliferation. Material and Methods:? The levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor?BB (PDGF-BB), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in supernatants of calcium- and thrombin-activated PRP samples from five donors were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Supernatants were treated with neutralizing antibodies specific to each growth factor, and the effects of these treatments on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation in vitro were determined. The effect of removing EGF from PRP supernatants with antibody-coated beads on HUVEC proliferation was also tested. Results:? Average concentrations of VEGF, PDGF-BB, bFGF and EGF in PRP supernatants were 189, 27,190, 39.5 and 513?pg/mL, respectively. The addition of EGF neutralizing antibodies to the PRP supernatants significantly reduced HUVEC proliferation (up to 40%), while such an inhibition was not observed following neutralization of the other growth factors. Removal of EGF from PRP supernatants by treatment with antibody-coated beads also resulted in a significant decrease in HUVEC proliferation. Recombinant EGF increased HUVEC proliferation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion:? This study showed that PRP supernatants are highly mitogenic for endothelial cells and provided evidence that this effect may be due, at least in part, to the presence of EGF. In vivo experiments are needed to confirm the roles of specific growth factors released from PRP in the healing of oral surgical and/or periodontal wounds.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews evidence-based guidelines supporting specific injury identification and management. Trauma is the leading cause of death for persons less than 44 years of age and the fifth leading cause for all ages. Injury results from a transfer of energy to the body tissues. Standardized, sequential evaluations of the trauma patient are the best methods to identify injuries. Caring for trauma patients is not just about knowing how to deal with the injuries, but being able to anticipate and prevent complications. Patients are at risk for some complications simply due to pain and immobility. In trauma patients, pain control is extremely important to avoid complications associated with immobility and hypoventilation. All trauma patients are at risk for bowel complications. All patients can benefit from a bowel protocol and timely nutrition.

AB  - A six-year-old, neutered, female golden retriever was presented with generalised, dark purple to black cutaneous nodules and gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Histopathologically, all cutaneous nodules were diagnosed as benign cavernous haemangiomas. Endoscopic analysis revealed similar nodules in the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum. At laparotomy, similar nodules were seen on the visceral peritoneal lining of abdominal organs. Metastatic haemangiosarcoma was ruled out based on histological features and lack of primary tumour in spleen, liver or heart ultrasonographically. Blood loss associated with gastrointestinal haemorrhage was managed with blood transfusion. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first canine case of multi-system progressive angiomatosis resembling blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome in humans.

AB  - Abstract Background Vorapaxar is indicated with standard antiplatelet therapy (APT) in patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) or peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Objectives To evaluate the comparative effects of vorapaxar on platelet-fibrin clot characteristics (PFCC), coagulation, inflammation, and platelet and endothelial function during treatment with daily 81 mg aspirin (A), 75 mg clopidogrel (C), both (C + A), or neither. Methods Thrombelastography, conventional platelet aggregation (PA), ex vivo endothelial function by ENDOPAT, coagulation, platelet activation/inflammation marked by urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 (UTxB2) and safety were determined in patients who were APT naïve (n = 21), on C (n = 8), on A (n = 29), and on A + C (n = 23) during 1 month of vorapaxar therapy and 1 month of offset. Results Vorapaxar had no effect on PFCC, ADP- or collagen-induced PA, thrombin time, fibrinogen, PT, PTT, von Willebrand factor (vWF), D-dimer, or endothelial function (P > .05 in all groups). Inhibition of SFLLRN (PAR-1 activating peptide)-stimulated PA by vorapaxar was accelerated by A + C at 2 hours (P < .05 versus other groups) with nearly complete inhibition by 30 days that persisted through 30 days after discontinuation in all groups (P < .001). SFLLRN-induced PA during offset was lower in APT patients versus APT-naïve patients (P < .05). Inhibition of UTxB2 was observed in APT-naive patients treated with vorapaxar (P < .05). Minor bleeding was only observed in C-treated patients. Conclusion Vorapaxar had no influence on PFCC measured by thrombelastography, coagulation, or endothelial function irrespective of APT. Inhibition of protease activated receptor (PAR)-1 mediated platelet aggregation by vorapaxar was accelerated by A + C and offset was prolonged by concomitant APT. Vorapaxar-induced anti-inflammatory effects were observed in non-aspirin-treated patients.

AB  - Abstract Despite the contrasts in chemistry and toxicity, for blister and nerve chemical warfare agents there may be some analogous proteolytic and in?ammatory mediators and pathological pathways that can be pharmacological targets for a single-drug multi-threat medical countermeasure. The dermal?epidermal separation caused by proteases and bullous diseases compared with that observed following exposure to the blister agent sulfur mustard (2,2?-dichlorodiethyl sul?de) has fostered the hypothesis that sulfur mustard vesication involves proteolysis and in?ammation. In conjunction with the paramount toxicological event of cholinergic crisis that causes acute toxicity and precipitates neuronal degeneration, both anaphylactoid reactions and pathological proteolytic activity have been reported in nerve-agent-intoxicated animals. Two classes of drugs already have demonstrated multi-threat activity for both nerve and blister agents. Serine protease inhibitors can prolong the survival of animals intoxicated with the nerve agent soman and can also protect against vesication caused by the blister agent sulfur mustard. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors can reduce both soman-induced neuronal degeneration and sulfur-mustard-induced epidermal necrosis. Protease and PARP inhibitors, like many of the other countermeasures for blister and nerve agents, have potent primary or secondary anti-in?ammatory pharmacology. Accordingly, we hypothesize that drugs with anti-in?ammatory actions against either nerve or blister agent might also display multi-threat ef?cacy for the in?ammatory pathogenesis of both classes of chemical warfare agent.

AB  - Removing, inactivating or detecting pathogens in platelet units are panaceas that some expect to revolutionize transfusion support for patients. Opting for transfusion without concern for the presence of pathogens may not be such a simple decision, however. The effect of pathogen reduction treatment may reduce platelet number and/or function. Clinical trials have documented that treated platelets provide effective hemostatic support for thrombocytopenic patients. However, platelets may need to be transfused in greater quantity, and thus the treatment technique may create a greater demand for the production of platelets through the supply system. Toxicologic concerns about the treatments must be addressed to ensure that there is net benefit for patients. Testing reported to date suggests that any residual compounds are at concentrations far below that associated with detectable toxicity, but the concept of transfusing a component containing even minute amounts of toxic substances may be unsettling to some. Detecting bacteria may remove the largest remaining infectious threat in platelet units and would leave platelets undamaged to function normally. This opens the option for extending the storage period of platelet units, but any extension of storage would be expected to be associated with a decrease in recovery and survival. To avoid continuing decrements with each proposed change in processing or storage, a new standard for efficacy has been proposed that would compare the recovery and survival of the platelet component to fresh platelets from the same donor. This standard appears useful and applicable in ensuring safe and efficacious platelets for transfusion. The question remains: Which direction is best for platelet recipients?

AB  - The Quebec platelet disorder is a serious bleeding disorder associated with proteolysis of α-granular proteins, including fibrinogen. We evaluated fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) assays as screening tests for this disorder. Patients with the Quebec platelet disorder (13/13) had elevated serum FDPs (P?<0.01) due to secreted degraded platelet fibrinogen, but normal plasma FDPs and D-dimers. Unrelated controls with bleeding disorders (32/34) had undetectable FDPs, and controls with FDPs due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and other illnesses (11/11) had elevated FDPs in all assays (P?<?0.01). Immunoblot analyses indicated plasma fibrinogen was normal in the Quebec patients and platelet FDPs were found in their platelet lysates, releasates and serum samples. Their platelet FDPs were not altered by treatment with fibrinolytic inhibitors and were different from the FDPs in DIC and in plasmin-digested fibrinogen. Tests for serum FDPs may provide a simple rapid way to screen for the Quebec platelet disorder.

AB  - Purpose? To discuss the entire spectrum of injuries seen in lower limb trauma and choice of reconstructive options. Methodology? Retrospective review of 72 consecutive cases in one year. Data collected from individual case records and the department photo data base. Injuries were classified and analyzed based on bone and soft tissue involvement, associated vascular injuries, mechanism of injury as in crush, degloving, and combined. Bony injuries were classified according to Gustilo?s classification. Treatment options and outcome for bone and soft tissue are discussed separately. Results? Total of 72 cases. 95%of cases were two wheeler traffic accidents. Distribution of cases according to site involved: Leg-39; Foot-14; Leg and foot-16; Thigh, leg, and foot-3. 8 of them were of Gustilo?s IIIB and 7 of IIIC. 42 flaps done included Gastrocnemius-4, Soleus-7, reverse sural-7, Cross leg-2, Fasciocutaneous-5 Perforator based local flaps-3Latissimus dorsi-7, Gracilis-6 Lateral thigh-1 Intervention: Immediate: 12%. Early (less than 1 week): 36, Delayed (>1 week): 52% Complications:Wound infection:Minor: 12; Major: 8 (3 Cases ? Clostridia) Partial flap loss: 6; Loss of SSG over flap/donor site: 5; Acute renal failure: 1 Amputations: Above knee: 4; below knee: 2 Conclusions? This series represents the spectrum of high velocity injuries in an overcrowded urban locality of developing country. Significant tissue loss is most often the rule. A judicious execution of reconstructive options can optimize results. Management protocols were adopted to avoid delayed referrals. This audit served as a benchmark to put together a dedicated trauma team in our hospital.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objective Platelet activation during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) initiates thrombus formation and plaque regrowth at sites of arterial injury, limiting procedure efficacy. We have developed a simple assay for circulating platelet activation based on fluorescence analysis of membrane fluidity and intracellular calcium concentration and light scattering analysis of platelet aggregation. Study Design/Materials and Methods Platelet activation state was measured in 45 patients undergoing angioplasty, before and after treatment with platelet inhibitors. Results PTCA alone produced a decrease in pyrene dimer formation (P0.0083) and an increase in light scattering at 650 nm (P0.0128). Treatment with ADP and GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists reduced PTCA induced changes in pyrene dimer formation. An unexpected decrease in pyrene dimer formation (P0.05) was detected when the GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist was given together with an ADP receptor antagonist. Conclusions 1) Analysis of membrane fluidity provides a sensitive marker for platelet activation state. 2) Reduced membrane fluidity after combined platelet inhibitor treatments suggests reduced antiplatelet efficacy.

AB  - Asymptomatic tumors are not uncommon, may be diagnosed during clinical examination or during surgical interventions for other purposes such as treatment of a hemorrhage due a blunt trauma. Case report? 6 year-old boy had fallen, hitting his abdomen against a rock, and arrived at hospital ten hours later. Initial assessment he was complaining of diffuse abdominal pain; his physical examination showed: respiratory rate: 16?mov/min, blood pressure: 100???80?mmHg, heart rate: 100?bat/min, and Glasgow coma score: 15. His abdomen was distended, with guarding and rebound tenderness, and had a palpable mass. FAST ultrasound was positive; and Ct-scan showed an abdominal mass with 15???12???7?cm dimension, and moderate amount of free blood in the abdominal cavity. Laboratory tests showed: hemoglobin 9.9?mg/dl, hematocritic 28.8%, white blood cells 6.900?cel/dl. Midline laparotomy was performed, a large, injured and bleeding mesenteric mass was found encircling superior mesentery artery and several small bowel loops; 500?ml of free blood was found in the peritoneal cavity. Mesenteric mass was partially removed with a segment of the small bowel. Findings of anatomico-pathologic examination revealed an intestinal Burkitt lymphoma, with mesenteric linfonodes. Patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and started with quimotherapy. Comments? This case report shows an unusual traumatic abdominal blending that could not be clearly diagnosed before laparotomy was performed. The emergency of this case was bleeding control, decision to remove mass was taken only for this purpose, and not to treat the tumor. As removal of the whole mass was impossible, a partial removal was performed.

AB  - Summary The activation and formation of a platelet plug at sites of injured vessels represent a first line defence against bleeding. A significant decrease in platelet numbers of and/or abnormalities in platelet function favour the characteristic skin and mucosal type of bleeding. This chapter deals with common and rare congenital platelet deficiencies and defects the pathogenesis of which has clarified over the last decade while their inheritance patterns and phenotypic penetrance has offered interesting genetic clues. Our classification system is hybrid, partly clinical and partly functional, and the layout of the chapter follows accordingly. A readable format balanced between the old and the new is provided, with an eye towards the future, the genetic treatment of these inherited bleeding disorders.

AB  - Objective Determine the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) on platelet function and thromboxane synthesis immediately after drug administration and following 5 days of NSAID administration in healthy horses. Study Design Randomized cross-over study. Animals Healthy adult horses (n=9; 6 geldings and 3 mares). Methods Horses received either flunixin meglumine (1.1 mg/kg IV every 12 hours), phenylbutazone (2.2 mg/kg IV every 12 hours), or firocoxib (loading dose of 0.27 mg/kg IV on day 1, then 0.09 mg/kg IV every 24 hours for 4 days) for a total of 5 days. Blood samples were collected prior to drug administration (day 0), 1 hour after initial NSAID administration (day 1), and then 1 hour post-NSAID administration on day 5. Platelet function was assessed using turbidimetric aggregometry and a platelet function analyzer. Serum thromboxane B2 concentrations were determined by commercial ELISA kit. A minimum 14 day washout period occurred between trials. Results At 1 hour and 5 days postadministration of firocoxib, flunixin meglumine, or phenylbutazone, there was no significant effect on platelet aggregation or function using turbidimetric aggregometry or a platelet function analyzer. There was, however, a significant decrease in thromboxane synthesis at 1 hour and 5 days postadministration of flunixin meglumine and phenylbutazone that was not seen with firocoxib. Conclusion Preoperative administration of flunixin meglumine, phenylbutazone, or firocoxib should not inhibit platelet function based on our model. The clinical implications of decreased thromboxane B2 synthesis following flunixin meglumine and phenylbutazone administration are undetermined.

Background Haemostatic resuscitation is now firmly established in military medical practice, despite the challenges of providing such therapy in austere settings. Materials and Methods Retrospective study of blood component use in service personnel admitted for trauma. Data were extracted from the UK Joint Theatre Trauma Registry. Results A total of 2618 patients were identified. Survival increased from 76 to 84% despite no change in injury severity. The proportion of patients receiving blood components increased from 13 to 32% per annum; 417 casualties received massive transfusion (≥10 units of RCC), the proportion increasing from 40 to 62%. Use of all blood components increased significantly in severely injured casualties, to a median (IQR) of 16 (9?25) units of red cell concentrate (P?=?0·006), 15 (8?24) of plasma (P?=?0·002), 2 (0?5) of platelets (P?<?0·001) and 1 (0?3) of cryoprecipitate (P?<?0·001). Cryoprecipitate (P?=?0·009) and platelet use (P?=?0·005) also increased in moderately injured casualties. Conclusions The number of blood components transfused to individual combat casualties increased during the 4-year period, despite no change in injury severity or injury pattern. Survival also increased. Combat casualties requiring massive transfusion have a significantly higher chance of survival than civilian patients. Survival is the product of the entire system of care. However, we propose that the changes in military transfusion practice and capability have contributed to increased combat trauma survival.

AB  - SUMMARY The aim of this article was to review recent developments in the resuscitation of both trauma and non-trauma patients in haemorrhagic shock. Strategies for the resuscitation of massively haemorrhaging patients and the use of massive transfusion protocols (MTPs) have been a major focus of the trauma literature over the past several years. The application of haemostatic resuscitation practices and MTPs to non-trauma populations has long been in practice, but has only recently been the subject of active research. Medline and PubMed were reviewed for ?massive transfusion? (MT) from 2012 to present. Non-English and paediatric articles were excluded. Articles were systematically reviewed for their relevance to MT. There were eight major areas of development identified. In recent MT literature, there was an increased focus on massively haemorrhaging non-trauma patients, the role of acute traumatic coagulopathy, the use of thromboelastography (TEG), and the impact of MTPs on blood product waste and efficiency of product delivery. Other developments included additional MT prediction tools and The PRospective Observational Multicenter Major Trauma Transfusion (PROMMTT) study. There was also interest in re-evaluating the clinical relevance of the current MT definition and identifying new foci for MT. These recent developments reflect efforts to better understand and manage non-traumatic haemorrhage and to address prior limitations in the trauma literature. Inevitably, new questions have been raised, which will likely direct ongoing and future research in MT.
