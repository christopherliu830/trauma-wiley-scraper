AB  - Reasons for performing study Normal radiographic anatomy of the juvenile donkey foot has not been reported previously. Objectives To provide a radiographic survey of the anatomical development of the donkey foot from 0 to 2 years of age. Study design Radiographic survey. Methods The right front foot of 9 donkey foals born in the spring of 2012, housed and fed in the same conditions, were radiographed every month for the first 6 months of age and every 3 months for the following 18 months. Latero-medial radiographs with and without barium markers at the coronary band and anterior-posterior radiographs of both front feet were obtained during weightbearing. Radiographs were obtained at 55?kV and 3?mAs with mobile x-ray equipment (Gierth RHF 200?ML, Examion DR810). Results The distal physis of the metacarpus (McIII) was closed at the mean age of 17.8 months (SD: 11.5, 21). The proximal physis of the proximal phalanx was closed at the mean age of 15.5 months (SD: 11.5, 21). The distal physis appeared as a clear radiolucent line at 2 weeks of age and was still visible subtly at 24 months. The proximal physis of the middle phalanx was closed at the mean age of 10.7 months (SD: 11.5, 19). The distal physis was visible at birth but closed at 4 days. Conclusions Based on our results, it seems that physes close at an older age in the donkey foal than in the horse. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Ethics committee of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium. (VUB/14-272-2). Owners gave informed consent for their horses' inclusion in the study. Source of funding:?The authors acknowledge Vtrade Belgium for the logistic assistance. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Hypoglycin A (HG) appears to cause atypical myopathy (AM), but to our knowledge, detection of HG in affected and unaffected horses and concurrently in plants that they were exposed to has not previously been reported. Objectives To investigate HG in samples from horses exposed to Acer pseudoplatanus (European sycamore maple) and in such plant material, at the time of clinical cases of AM in the herd. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Blood was collected from 2 horses with AM and 22 clinically healthy co-grazing horses in 2 Swedish farms within one week of onset of signs (May 2014) and one month later, after horses were moved to other pastures. Ten healthy control horses from unaffected farms were sampled once. Samaras, seedlings, flowers and leaves from Acer pseudoplatanus and from Acer platanoides L (Norway maple) were collected from affected pastures. Hypoglycin A was analysed using chemical derivatisation with dansyl chloride (DNS) and ultra high performance liquid chromatography?tandem mass spectrometry. Hypoglycin A was detected as derivatised compound HG-DNS [M+H]+ with selected reaction monitoring. Results Hypoglycin A was detected in the horses affected with AM, and also in 20 out of 22 co-grazing horses. One month later, a surviving case horse and 9/20 co-grazing horses were still positive for HG. Controls from other farms were negative for HG. Hypoglycin A was detected in plant material from Acer pseudoplatanus, but not from Acer platanoides L. Conclusions Horses grazing in pastures with HG-containing Acer pseudoplatanus were positive for HG in blood, and some showed severe signs of myopathy. Ethical animal research:?Ethical consent for blood sampling was granted (C113/11) and horse owners gave their informed consent to inclusion of horses in the study.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The morphology of the dorsal (DCB) and ventral (VCB) nasal conchal bullae, including their cellulae, drainage and histology, are poorly described. The recent recognition that these bullae can become infected, causing chronic unilateral nasal discharge has stimulated interest in these structures. A more complete understanding of their anatomy would be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of their disorders. Objectives To document the structure, drainage and histology of the equine DCB and VCB. Study design Descriptive. Methods Fourteen fresh cadaveric horse heads, were transected sagittally midline and dissected to expose the nasal conchal bullae. The dimensions of each bulla, the number of drainage apertures, the number of cellulae and orientation of the septae were recorded. Representative samples were collected for histopathology. Results The mean lengths of the DCB and VCB were 77.7?mm (range 48?105?mm) and 57.1?mm (range 34?86?mm) respectively; equivalent to 13.8% and 10.2% of skull length, respectively. The mean widths of the DCB and VCB were 28.5?mm (range 21?35?mm) and 28.2?mm (range 13?41?mm) respectively; equivalent to 5.1% and 5% of skull length respectively. The median number of drainage apertures from the DCB and VCB were 2 and 1 respectively. The median number of cellulae within the DCB and VCB were 3 and 2, respectively. No communications were identified between the DCB and VCB and the adjacent paranasal sinuses. Histology revealed that the bullae consisted of ciliated, pseudostratified, columnar epithelium supported by a glandular submucosa often overlying turbinate bone and, variably, hyaline cartilage. Conclusions The morphology of the equine nasal conchal bullae is quite variable. The DCB is generally a more complex structure than the VCB, containing more septae, cellulae and drainage apertures. This more detailed description of DCB and VCB anatomy will hopefully facilitate successful treatment of their disorders.

AB  - Abstract The paper provides a brief overview of the use of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) in the areas of bone regenerative medicine. Reconstruction of bone defects caused by trauma, non-union, and bone tumor excision, still faces many challenges despite the intense investigations and advancement in bone-tissue engineering and bone regeneration over the past decades. IONPs have promising prospects in this field due to their controlled responsive characteristics in specific external magnetic fields and have been of great interest during the last few years. This Minireview aims to summarize the relevant progress and describes the following five aspects: (i) The general introduction of IONPs, with a focus on the magnetic properties as the base of application; (ii) using IONPs as tools to study and control stem cells for better treatment efficacy in stem-cell-based bone defect repair; (iii) the use of IONPs and their complexes in the delivery of therapeutic agents, including chemical drug molecules, growth factors, and genetic materials, to promote osteogenesis-related cell function and differentiation, healthy bone tissue growth, and functional reconstruction; (iv) magneto-mechanical actuation in the regulation of cells distribution, mechano-transduction membrane receptors activation, and mechanosensitive signaling pathways regulation, and (v) fabrication, characteristics, and in?vitro and in?vivo osteogenic effects of magnetic composite bone scaffolds. Ongoing prospects are also discussed.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Synovial fluid (SF) is located in joint cavities, tendon sheaths and bursae. In joints it comprises a serum filtrate with additional contributions from articular cartilage, synovium and bone. Low molecular weight metabolites represent the end product of the cell regulatory processes. Synovial fluid represents a potential source of disease specific metabolites that could aid in the understanding of the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) and be used in its early diagnosis. Objectives We hypothesise that there are different metabolomic profiles that can be identified in early OA SF and some of these metabolites are potential biomarkers. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Synovial fluid was used from the metacarpophalangeal joints of 9 normal and 9 OA Thoroughbred horses following macroscopic, microscopic and synovitis scoring. SF was analysed with Proton (1H)-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with a 600?MHz Avance III equipped with a cryoprobe and chilled sample-jet autosampler. The software we use is Topsin 3.1 and IconNMR 4.6.7. The following methods were used in order to identify changes in lipids and small molecules; 1D Nuclear Overhauser Effect, Longitudinal Encode-decode and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill. Data analysis was undertaken using unsupervised statistical methods and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Results The results demonstrated clustering on principle component analysis between normal and OA samples. Seven metabolites were identified as significantly different in OA P<0.05; mobile lipid 1, methyl group, 2 lactates, proline and 2 citrates. Furthermore total lipid load correlated very closely to Mankin's scoring. Using IPA we identified metabolic pathways relating to altered glycolysis in early OA. Conclusions We identified the metabolic fingerprint of early OA which may allow for better phenotyping of disease states and thereby facilitate targeting of improved treatment regimes.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Accurate diagnosis of chronic foot pain by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows appropriate case selection for palmar/plantar digital neurectomy (PDN). Objectives To report follow-up for chronic foot pain treated by PDN, with and without MRI diagnosis. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods The electronic patient records of all animals that underwent PDN were reviewed. Follow-up was obtained from owners using a structured postal/telephone questionnaire. Chi squared/Fisher's exact tests or 2-sample t tests were used, with statistical significance set as P<0.05. Results One hundred and nine PDN cases were undertaken. Follow-up response rate was 72.5%. From these 79 cases, 52 had MRI (MRI+) and 27 did not (MRI?). There was no significant difference in case distribution between the 2 groups: predominantly horses, Warmbloods, geldings, used for full competitions, except MRI+ were younger than MRI? (median 9.99 and 11.71 years respectively, P?=?0.004). Median follow-up time for MRI+ was 31.4 months, and for MRI? was 36.8 months. There was no significant difference in outcome. In total, 78.9% MRI+ achieved their intended use, compared with 73.1% MRI?. For those intended for exercise, 83.7% MRI+ reached a level of exercise, compared with 87.5% MRI?. Median length of exercise maintenance was 25.2 months for MRI+ and 24.0 months for MRI?. For MRI+ there was one suspected and one confirmed neuroma and 4 neuritis cases. Two MRI? animals developed neuritis. Complications requiring euthanasia occurred in 2 MRI? cases: complete rupture of the deep digital flexor tendon in a bilateral forelimb lameness and one previous chronic laminitic with solar prolapse. Conclusions These results are comparable with previous reports of 80% of MRI+ returning to previous athletic use for 20 months. Achievement of intended use, length of exercise maintenance and complication rate was similar with and without MRI diagnosis, although both catastrophic complications occurred in animals which did not undergo MRI.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Although fasciolosis is an important livestock disease worldwide, the public health importance of human fasciolosis has increased in recent years and it is recognised as an important re-emerging zoonotic disease, its epidemiology and pathogenicity in donkeys, and the epidemiological role they may play have not been determined. Objectives To investigate the epidemiology and pathogenicity of fasciolosis in donkeys. Study design Cross-sectional coprological and retrospective post-mortem study. Methods Faecal samples collected from 803 randomly selected working donkeys from the central region of Ethiopia were analysed by a sedimentation-centrifugation-flotation technique. Further data on liver-flukes and associated pathologies were obtained by routine post mortem examinations of 112 donkeys, subjected to euthanasia on welfare grounds or died. Data were analysed using a generalised linear model and multivariate binary logistic regression in R statistical package with significance level of statistical tests set at P<0.05. Results Infection prevalences of 44.4% and 41.9% were obtained in coprologically and post mortem examined donkeys, respectively, irrespective of their age. Both Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica were identified with the mean infection intensity of 30 flukes. Older donkeys (‚â•8 years) were found harbouring a significantly higher worm burden (P<0.0001). Gross and histopathologies of hyperplasia and thickening of the bile ducts, fibrosis of large portal areas and irregular bile duct proliferation and hypertrophy were noted. Conclusions The high infection prevalence of fasciolosis and the associated hepatic pathologies in working donkeys shows not only the susceptibility of donkeys and the impact it has on their health, but also indicates the important role they can play in the epidemiology of both livestock and human fasciolosis. These further demonstrate the need for these animals to be considered in the overall epidemiological studies and for sound control strategies and prevention of fasciolosis.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Regional adiposity on the neck crest has been linked to increased risk of developing equine metabolic syndrome (EMS). However, little is known about inherent metabolic differences between adipose tissues. Objectives To investigate innate differences between adipose tissue from neck crest compared to abdominal, mesenteric, and tail head in horses with no diagnosis of EMS. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Seven horses with no history of metabolic disorders were subjected to euthanasia for nonclinical reasons. They were selected randomly (5 geldings/2 mares; age 6?26 years; 110?165?cm height; BCS 3?8) and included with owners' consent. Adipose tissue was collected from neck crest, abdominal tissue, small intestine mesentery, and tail pad. mRNA expression of insulin-associated genes GLUT1, GLUT4, INSR and RBP4, and inflammation-associated genes SAA, TNFŒ±, IL-1?, IL-6, MCP-1 and PAI-1 were investigated using RT-qPCR. Morphology and adipocyte size were investigated by histology. Release of non-essential fatty acids (NEFA) was investigated before/after adrenaline stimulation in 4 horses. Results No significant differences were found in mRNA expression of metabolic and inflammation related genes between tissues. Adipose tissue from neck crest was more heterogeneous than abdominal fat (P?=?0.001) and mesenteric fat (P?=?0.01). Neck crest adipocytes were similar in size to abdominal adipocytes, and larger than adipocytes from tail head and mesentery. Basal levels of NEFA release were not different between tissues. Adrenaline stimulation caused a significant release of NEFA from visceral fat (abdominal P?=?0.03; mesenteric P?=?0.048). Conclusions This preliminary study introduces new metabolic genetic markers and NEFA to the field of metabolic research. No innate differences were shown for neck crest fat except in histology. Further studies in a case?control study design are needed to determine if neck crest fat is a risk factor for EMS.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Thyroid hormones (THs) decrease with age in healthy dogs and cats, although they tend to remain within established reference ranges. Thyrotropin (TSH) is increased in elderly people, with or without mild alterations in THs. Objectives To test the hypothesis that geriatric horses will have lower THs and/or higher TSH compared with younger horses. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Resting THs and TSH, and responses to thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) were compared between young and old horses. Data from 71 normal, healthy horses that had participated in prior research projects were examined, and found to contain 42 horses 3?10 years of age, 16 horses >15 years and 10 horses >20 years. All samples had been assayed in the same previously validated radioimmunoassays. Statistical analysis was performed with commercial software. Results Although lower, THs were not significantly different between young and old horses when compared with the Mann?Whitney rank sum test. However, TSH concentration was significantly higher in horses aged >20 (median 0.52?ng/ml) or >15 years (0.44?ng/ml) compared to younger horses (0.33?ng/ml). TRH stimulation tests were performed in 19 of the younger horses, 7 of the horses >20, and 11 of the horses >15. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA on ranks revealed no significant differences in TH responses to TRH. The TSH response to TRH appeared to be slightly greater in the older horses, but did not quite reach significance (P?=?0.06). Conclusion Similar to reports in elderly humans, aged horses have higher serum TSH concentrations than younger horses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Respiratory disease is a common cause of morbidity in geriatric horses, with a high prevalence of respiratory clinical signs; increasing with increasing horse age. However, owners frequently do not attribute these signs to disease and may not seek veterinary attention. Objectives To estimate the prevalence of recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) in the British geriatric equine population using a risk-screening questionnaire (RSQ) and identify factors associated with RAO. Study design Cross-sectional. Methods Owners of geriatric horses/ponies enrolled in a previous cohort study were sent a postal questionnaire, combining a validated RSQ with questions regarding management, preventive healthcare, and respiratory-specific clinical signs. An RSQ score of >0.87 was the positive cut-off for RAO. Factors associated with RAO were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Results The useable response rate was 43.1%, providing data for 285 horses/ponies (median age 23.3 years). Coughing within the preceding year (27.0%) was the most prevalent owner-reported clinical sign. Among the study population, the apparent prevalence of RAO using the RSQ was 20.7%. 10.5% of horses/ponies were reported to have veterinary-diagnosed RAO (median age at diagnosis 13 years), of which 33.3% had a positive RSQ score. Data from 273 animals were included in the multivariable model, and factors associated with increased risk of RAO were ridden exercise ‚â•4 days/week (odds ratio [OR] 3.64; P?=?0.005) compared to no exercise; residing on a farm (OR 4.99; P?=?0.04) compared to residing on the owner's home premises and having had a respiratory infection within the past 12 months (OR 4.87; P<0.001). Conclusions Risk-screening questionnaire score-determined RAO prevalence was considerably higher than the proportion of animals previously diagnosed with RAO. This suggests under-diagnosis of respiratory problems in geriatric horses, much of which may be unrecognised or undiagnosed RAO. Risk factors identified differ from those previously reported for the general equine population.

Return of a completed postal questionnaire was taken as informed owner consent.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Bronchopneumonia caused by Rhodococcus equi is an important disease of young horses throughout the world. Although early diagnosis and treatment improves the prognosis, this also increases the amount of antimicrobial usage and therefore increases the likelihood of resistance developing. Objectives The aim of this study was to determine the level of resistance to commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents of 97 virulent Rhodococcus equi isolates. Study design Analysis of archived samples. Methods Virulent Rhodococcus equi isolates were collected between 1991 and 2014 from clinically affected horses and from air samples collected in the breathing zone of foals. Antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates was assessed using a disc diffusion assay with a panel of agents. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for rifampicin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and neomycin using a novel resazurin-based microtitre assay. Results Resistance to rifampicin was detected in 3 of the isolates (2 collected in 2013 and one in 2014) by both methods. The MIC for these isolates was 64??g/ml (n?=?2) and 16??g/ml (n?=?1). All isolates collected prior to 2013 had MICs<0.125??g/ml, which was the limit of detection in this assay. Although no isolates were resistant to tetracycline, there was a general increase in MIC in isolates collected in recent years. No isolates were resistant to either neomycin or erythromycin, with MIC values ranging between 0.25 and 2??g/ml for neomycin and 0.125?1??g/ml for erythromycin. Conclusions The success of the macrolide-rifampicin combination relies on the synergistic action of these 2 agents. Resistance to rifampicin will reduce the therapeutic efficacy of this treatment. It is of serious concern that the resistant isolates were all recently collected. Hopefully, recent research will lead to fewer asymptomatic foals receiving antimicrobials which will in turn reduce the likelihood of ongoing development of resistance.

Although in vitro assessments are the first step in the process of development, the safety and efficacy of an IBS strongly depend on validated preclinical research prior to clinical trials. However, the selection of a suitable preclinical model for performance evaluation of an IBS remains a challenge, as no gold standard exists to define the best animal model. In order to succeed in this attempt, we identified three stages of development, including (a) proof-of-principle, (b) predictive validity and (c) general scientific legitimacy, and the respective criteria that should be applied for such selection. The second part of this review provides an overview of commonly used animals for IBSs. Specifically, scientific papers published between January 1996 and March 2012 were retrieved that report the use of preclinical models for the evaluation of IBSs in situations requiring bone healing and bone augmentation. This review is meant not only to describe the currently available preclinical models for IBS application, but also to address critical considerations of such multi-factorial evaluation models (including animal species, strain, age, anatomical site, defect size and type of bone), which can be indicative but in most cases edge away from the human reality. Consequently, the ultimate goal is to guide researchers toward a more careful and meaningful interpretation of the results of experiments using animal models and their clinical applications.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Early identification of surgical cases of colic is critical to improving outcome and welfare. There have been a number of studies on diagnostic tests for colic, evaluating a range of tests to differentiate between medical and surgical cases. Objectives To systematically review and appraise the evidence on diagnostic tests for identifying surgical colic. Study design Systematic review. Methods The primary literature search was conducted in CAB Abstracts (1910?2014), WEB of Science (1950?2014) and MEDLINE (1946?2014) using search terms relating to equine colic. Publications were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria, and then reviewed using the QUADAS quality assessment tool. Results The primary search identified 5508 publications relating to equine colic; 976 related to diagnostic tests, 29 met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using the QUADAS tool. Of these, 16 papers reported on peritoneal fluid parameters, 21 on blood parameters, 10 on blood and peritoneal parameters, 3 on physical and blood parameters and one study on urine parameters. A range of different parameters were evaluated, with the majority of tests only being evaluated in single studies. None of the studies met QUADAS criteria 1 (representative spectrum of patients), 7/29 studies met criteria 2 (description of selection criteria) and 10/29 studies met criteria 9 (description of reference standard). Conclusions There are currently no published studies which use appropriate methodology to assess the accuracy of a diagnostic test in differentiating medical and surgical colic. This made direct application of the QUADAS tool challenging; predominantly due to the lack of a pre mortem ?gold standard? reference diagnostic test for colic. Very few studies enrolled a randomised selection of patients and there was also a propensity to case?control study design, both increasing the risk of bias and under/overestimating diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Rasping of sharp enamel points (SEPs) is the most common procedure performed at routine dental examinations; however, there is little evidence to prove the true clinical significance of SEPs [1]. Maxillary SEPs are thought to cause buccal ulceration and pain on external palpation of the cheeks. Mandibular SEPs are thought to cause lingual ulceration. Objectives To examine associations between the presence of SEPs on the cheek teeth rows and the presence of pain on palpation of the cheeks and buccal and/or lingual ulceration. Study design Retrospective clinical case series. Methods Clinical records of routine dental examination performed by 8 veterinary surgeons in a single first opinion practice were examined. Presence of SEPs, buccal and/or lingual ulceration and pain on palpation of the cheeks (externally) were recorded. Chi squared tests were used to examine whether horses exhibiting pain on palpation or oral ulceration were significantly more likely to have SEPs present. Results Prevalence of buccal SEPs was 84.8% and prevalence of lingual SEPs was 84.3%. Five hundred and forty-eight horses (6.0%) had signs of pain on palpation. Prevalence of buccal ulceration was 5.9%. In contrast, only 0.2% of horses had visible lingual ulceration. Buccal ulceration and pain on palpation were significantly associated with presence of buccal SEPs (P<0.001 for both). Lingual ulceration was not significantly associated with lingual SEPs (P<0.0001). Conclusions Buccal SEPs are common and often result in pain and buccal ulceration. Routine rasping would appear to be justified. Lingual SEPs are common but rarely cause lingual ulceration. The value of routine rasping of lingual SEPs is therefore questionable.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Lameness negatively affects the welfare of horses; it often coexists with thoracolumbar pain. The mechanisms linking the two are not well understood. Objectives To document thoracolumbar movement in subjectively sound horses comparing straight lines with circles on left and right reins; to relate these observations to the objectively determined symmetry/asymmetry of hindlimb gait. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Fourteen non-lame horses were trotted in straight lines and lunged on a 10?m diameter circle on left and right reins and inertial sensor data collected at landmarks: withers, 13th (T13) and 18th thoracic vertebrae, 3rd lumbar vertebra, tubera sacrale, left and right tubera coxae. Data were processed using published methods [1]; pitch and roll, dorsoventral and lateral motion and symmetry within each stride were assessed. Results Dorsoventral motion during one stride had a sinusoidal pattern with 2 oscillations. The greatest amplitude and symmetry (119?¬±?4?mm, 96?¬±?1% in straight lines vs. 127?¬±?5?mm, 94?¬±?1% in circles) occurred at T13. Circles induced greater rotation around the transverse axis (>1.3¬∞, P?=?0.002) and movement in a lateral direction (>16?mm P?=?0.002), greater dorsoventral amplitude and asymmetry; however, the latter differences were nonsignificant. There were no significant differences between reins. The difference in the left and right hindlimb stance phases and the 2 oscillations of the thoracolumbar were significantly associated. Greater circle-induced upward movement of a tuber coxae during the contralateral hindlimb stance was associated with greater circle-induced asymmetry of the 2 oscillations of the thoracolumbar (P?=?0.04). Conclusions Moving on a circle induces measurable changes in thoracolumbar movement compared with moving in straight lines, associated with alterations in the hindlimb gait.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Injury to the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) is common in equids, with a high risk of re-injury associated with changes in tendon stiffness. In vivo measurement of limb stiffness has been shown to correlate with tendon stiffness after injury [1] but requires kinematic analysis which is impractical in a clinical setting. We have developed a simple system for measuring limb stiffness statically, which could be used as a tool for monitoring SDFT healing. Objectives To validate a goniometric measurement of limb stiffness. Study design Cross sectional study. Methods Initially, forelimb stiffness indices were determined at the walk for 6 equids using a validated kinematic analysis [1]. Limb stiffness indices were then calculated using portable floor scales to record ground reaction force (GRF), and an electrogoniometer to record metacarpophalangeal joint angle. Goniometric limb stiffness indices were subsequently measured in 11 horses ranging from 2 to 20 years of age, with no clinical evidence of SDFT injury. Strength and significance of correlation and agreement between the measurement methods was assessed and association between limb stiffness, limb (left vs. right), weight and age of horse and were calculated. Results There were strong positive correlations between GRF and joint angle (R2?=?0.98) and between the static and kinematic methods (R?=?0.78, P<0.01). There was a positive correlation between limb stiffness and weight (R2?=?0.85, P<0.01), but no association with age or limb. Conclusions This study validated the measurement of limb stiffness in a clinical setting. The positive correlation of limb stiffness and weight supports the theory of an optimised limb spring [2] for energy-efficient cursorial locomotion which may, in turn, provide a clinically-relevant measure of running efficiency and therefore the quality of tendon healing post injury.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The birthweight of Thoroughbred foals has increased in recent years. It is unknown whether this is associated with increased broodmare obesity or endocrine dysfunction. Objectives To determine insulin, leptin and triglyceride concentrations in obese and non-obese Thoroughbred mares throughout gestation and to investigate their association with foal birthweight. Study design Prospective, cohort study. Methods Fifty-seven pregnant Thoroughbred mares were included in the study. From 40 days post-breeding, body condition score (BCS), weight and venous blood samples were obtained every 60 days throughout gestation. Feed was withheld for 6?h before blood sampling. Serum/plasma insulin, leptin and triglyceride concentrations were measured using validated/standard methods. Foal birthweight was recorded. Association of hormone or triglyceride concentration with time, BCS and birthweight were analysed using a linear mixed effects model. A Pearson correlation co-efficient was calculated between hormone or triglyceride concentration, BCS and birthweight. Results Serum insulin concentrations were significantly greater (P<0.05) at 0?59 days compared with 240?299 days and at 60?119 days compared with 180?359 days gestation. 55% of mares had BCS?‚â•?7. There was 1.5% incidence of fasting hyperinsulinaemia throughout gestation and no association of fasting insulin concentration with BCS. Leptin concentration was significantly (P<0.0001) greater at 180?239 days compared with all other time points and was significantly (r?=?0.29, P<0.0003) correlated with BCS. Triglyceride concentration was significantly (P<0.02) greater at 240?299 days compared with earlier time points but was not associated with BCS. Foal birthweight was significantly positively correlated with BCS (r?=?0.13, P<0.001) and inversely correlated with leptin concentration at 60?119 days and 240?299 days gestation (r?=??0.64, P<0.05). Conclusions Mare BCS correlated with foal birthweight such that obese mares had heavier foals. Significant fasting hyperinsulinaemia was not identified in this population. Increased leptin concentration in early and late gestation was associated with decreased foal birthweight and may be useful to predict foal birthweight.

AB  - Reasons for performing study In cases of laminitis, an increased muscle force or contracture of the deep digital flexor muscle (DDFM) is suggested, but evidence-based research is lacking. Objectives To test if the DDFM of laminitic equines shows an increased muscle force detectable by needle-EMG including Interference Pattern Analysis (IPA). Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Three groups consisted of Group 0 (control): 6 Royal Dutch Sport horses, 3 Shetland ponies and one Welsh pony (healthy, sound adults, mean?¬±?s.d. weight 411?¬±?217?kg). Group 1: 3 Royal Dutch Sport horses, one Friesian, one Haflinger, one Icelandic horse, 2 Welsh ponies, one miniature Appaloosa and 6 Shetland ponies (adults, mean?¬±?s.d. weight 310?¬±?172?kg) suffering from acute or chronic laminitis. EMG measurements including firing frequency (F) and IPA parameters Turns/Second (T), Amplitude/Turn (M) and Ratio M/T (R) were performed. ANOVA was used to analyse data. P values of P<0.05 were considered significant. Results Mean?¬±?s.d. F of Group 0 and Group 1 was 53?¬±?11 and 72?¬±?21?Hz, mean?¬±?s.d. T was 112?¬±?57 and 106?¬±?42, mean?¬±?s.d. M was 284?¬±?51 and 254?¬±?38??V and mean?¬±?s.d. R was 0.39?¬±?0.17 and 0.42?¬±?0.16%, respectively. The firing frequency of Group 1 was significantly higher compared to Group 0 (P?=?0.02), whereas other differences were not significant. Conclusions In human medicine, an increased firing frequency is a characteristic of increased muscle force [1,2]. Thus, the increased firing frequency of the DDFM in case of laminitis suggests an elevated muscle force. As all parameters show a high variance, a repeated study including a larger test group is advised.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Blackthorn (Prunus spinosus) is recognised as causing infections and tissue reactions. Objectives To describe the presentation, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of blackthorn plant thorn synovitis in the horse. Study design Case series. Methods All cases in this prospective study presented with acute onset synovitis within 24?h of thorn penetration, had a standardised clinical assessment, surgical treatment and aftercare. Surgical treatment was performed within 24?h of presentation under general anaesthesia, using a 2-stage procedure: Stage 1: perisynovial technique. Ultrasound guided placement of a 20 gauge 35?mm needle marker that is used as a guide for electrosurgical dissection onto perisynovial thorn fragments. Stage 2: endoscopic technique. Using standard and novel portals to locate and remove thorn fragments and debris from synovial structures. Results Thirty-five cases met the study inclusion criteria over a 24 month period. Mean lameness score on presentation was 4/5 (range 1?5). The most commonly affected structures were fetlock joints (11/35) and tendon sheaths (10/35). Mean synovial fluid total protein was 50.5?g/l (range 18?116), and TNCC was 158?x?109 (range 21?412) on presentation and 12?x?109 (range 1?46) at 48?h post operatively. All synovial fluid cultures were negative. All horses were sound (grade 0) at 5 days post operatively and all returned to full work. Conclusions There are a limited number of case series of blackthorn injury in humans; however, the consensus is that surgical treatment is required for a successful outcome. The 2-stage surgical procedure described, achieved accurate identification and removal of thorn material in all cases. In contrast to previous studies on synovial sepsis, these cases had a positive outcome despite high pre- and post operative synovial fluid total protein and TNCC. These findings suggest that thorn synovitis cases have a different aetiology from synovitis originating from sepsis or contamination.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Triamcinolone is commonly used in equine practice for the treatment of orthopaedic conditions. A serious potential adverse effect of triamcinolone is laminitis. However, evidence for the risk of laminitis associated with triamcinolone use is limited. Objectives To determine the risk of laminitis within 90 days of triamcinolone administration and compare with the risk of laminitis in a veterinary-attended horse population. Study design Retrospective study of clinical records. Methods Text mining and data extraction was performed using content analysis software (SimStat-WordStat v.6) on a database of anonymous digital clinical records from a convenience sample of North American equine practices (n?=?9). Medical records were retrieved using a dictionary of keywords for 3 groups of horses: 1) treated with triamcinolone, 2) age and practice matched control population (no triamcinolone) and 3) all laminitic horses. Records of horses within Groups 1 and 2 were mined for evidence of laminitis within a 90-day period of treatment or a random date respectively. Data manipulation and analysis was performed using R v3.0.0 (R Development Core Team). The prevalence of laminitis within all groups was determined and relative risk of developing laminitis determined by single logistic regression. Results The clinical records of 225,777 horses were examined. Overall prevalence of laminitis within the database was 1.1% (n?=?2533). Triamcinolone was administered to 12.4% (n?=?27,898) horses and 0.07% of treated horses (n?=?20) developed laminitis. In the control population (n?=?56,695), 0.2% of horses (n?=?134) developed laminitis. The risk of developing laminitis was significantly lower in the triamcinolone treatment group than the control population (OR 0.3 95%CI, 0.18?0.48 P<0.001). Conclusions Triamcinolone treatment does not increase the overall risk of a horse developing laminitis. However, further investigation of risk factors for laminitis in the 20 horses identified by this preliminary study is warranted to aid development of evidence-based treatment guidelines.
