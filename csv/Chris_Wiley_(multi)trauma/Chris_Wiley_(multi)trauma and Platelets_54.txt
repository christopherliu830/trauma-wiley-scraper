AB  - Human vascularized allografts are perfused through blood vessels composed of cells (endothelium, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells) that remain largely of graft origin and are thus subject to host alloimmune responses. Graft vessels must be healthy to maintain homeostatic functions including control of perfusion, maintenance of permselectivity, prevention of thrombosis, and participation in immune surveillance. Vascular cell injury can cause dysfunction that interferes with these processes. Graft vascular cells can be activated by mediators of innate and adaptive immunity to participate in graft inflammation contributing to both ischemia/reperfusion injury and allograft rejection. Different forms of rejection may affect graft vessels in different ways, ranging from thrombosis and neutrophilic inflammation in hyperacute rejection, to endothelialitis/intimal arteritis and fibrinoid necrosis in acute cell-mediated or antibody-mediated rejection, respectively, and to diffuse luminal stenosis in chronic rejection. While some current therapies targeting the host immune system do affect graft vascular cells, direct targeting of the graft vasculature may create new opportunities for preventing allograft injury and loss.

AB  - Summary Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is a rare multi-organ recessive disease mainly characterised by pancreatic insufficiency, skeletal defects, short stature and bone marrow failure (BMF). As in many other BMF syndromes, SDS patients are predisposed to develop a number of haematopoietic malignancies, particularly myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia. However, the mechanism of cancer predisposition in SDS patients is only partially understood. In light of the emerging role of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in the regulation of bone marrow homeostasis, we assessed the ability of MSCs derived from SDS patients (SDS-MSCs) to recreate a functional bone marrow niche, taking advantage of a murine heterotopic MSC transplant model. We show that the ability of semi-cartilaginous pellets (SCPs) derived from SDS-MSCs to generate complete heterotopic ossicles in vivo is severely impaired in comparison with HD-MSC-derived SCPs. Specifically, after in vitro angiogenic stimuli, SDS-MSCs showed a defective ability to form correct networks, capillary tubes and vessels and displayed a marked decrease in VEGFA expression. Altogether, these findings unveil a novel mechanism of SDS-mediated haematopoietic dysfunction based on hampered ability of SDS-MSCs to support angiogenesis. Overall, MSCs could represent a new appealing therapeutic target to treat dysfunctional haematopoiesis in paediatric SDS patients.

AB  - Abstract Management of pain in the traumatized animal or in animals with emergent diseases is important in optimizing effective treatment of general disease processes. An understanding of normal animal behaviors and behaviors indicative of pain in animals is necessary for detection of painful conditions given the non-verbal nature of animals. There are a number of pain assessment tools available that, with appropriate training and education, can be implemented to effectively detect pain and track responses to therapies or interventions. In addition to an understanding of pain behaviors, a detailed understanding of the physiological changes associated with specific pain syndromes is necessary for an effective, mechanism-based approach to pain management.

AB  - The indications for transfusing fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate and cryosupernatant plasma are very limited. When transfused they can have unpredictable adverse effects. The risks of transmitting infection are similar to those of other blood components unless a pathogen-reduced plasma (PRP) is used. Of particular concern are allergic reactions and anaphylaxis, transfusion-related acute lung injury, and haemolysis from transfused antibodies to blood group antigens, especially A and B. FFP is not indicated in disseminated intravascular coagulation without bleeding, is only recommended as a plasma exchange medium for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (for which cryosupernatant is a possible alternative), should never be used to reverse warfarin anticoagulation in the absence of severe bleeding, and has only a very limited place in prophylaxis prior to liver biopsy. When used for surgical or traumatic bleeding, FFP and cryoprecipitate doses should be guided by coagulation studies, which may include near-patient testing. FFP is not indicated to reverse vitamin K deficiency for neonates or patients in intensive care units. PRP may be used as an alternative to FFP. In the UK, PRP from countries with a low bovine spongiform encephalopathy incidence is recommended by the Departments of Health for children born after 1 January 1996. Arrangements for limited supplies of single donor PRP of non-UK origin are expected to be completed in 2004. Batched pooled commercially prepared PRP from donors in the USA (Octaplas) is licensed and available in the UK. FFP must be thawed using a technique that avoids risk of bacterial contamination. Plastic packs containing any of these plasma products are brittle in the frozen state and must be handled with care.

AB  - Summary The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic effect of low triiodothyronine (T3) syndrome on patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A hundred and eighty-eight patients with detailed thyroid hormone levels at diagnosis of DLBCL were enrolled. Low T3 syndrome was defined as a low serum free T3 (FT3) level with low or normal serum free tetraiodothyronine (FT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone levels. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to screen prognostic factors associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Receiver-operator characteristic curves and the corresponding areas under the curve were calculated to assess the predictive accuracy of International Prognostic Index (IPI) and low T3 syndrome. Twenty-four patients were diagnosed with low T3 syndrome, which was associated with worse PFS and OS in the rituximab era. It was an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS, especially for those with IPI 0?2, extranodal sites ≤1 and stage III?IV. Synchronously low FT3 and FT4 had poorer survival outcome compared to only low FT3 and adding criterion of low T3 syndrome improved the prognostic capacity of IPI for predicting PFS and OS in DLBCL. Low T3 syndrome was found to be a strong prognostic predictor in DLBCL.

Microfluidic platforms integrated with analytical instrumentation offer the capability to study polymer adsorption in flow in a time- and labour-efficient manner. Precise control of the microchannel dimensions and flow parameters enables accurate control of shear forces imposed on polymer solutions and on the molecules deposited on the surface, along with high sensitivity, enhanced reliability, and low reagent consumption. This review highlights recent advances in theoretical and experimental microfluidic studies of polymer immobilization under flow conditions in three area, namely, biosensing, biofouling, and studies of thrombosis and hemostasis.

AB  - Abstract Biologics are playing an increasingly significant role in the practice of modern medicine and surgery in general and orthopedics in particular. Cell-based approaches are among the most important and widely used modalities in orthopedic biologics, with mesenchymal stem cells and other multi/pluripotent cells undergoing evaluation in numerous preclinical and clinical studies. On the other hand, fully differentiated endothelial cells (ECs) have been found to perform critical roles in homeostasis of visceral tissues through production of an adaptive panel of so-called ?angiocrine factors.? This newly discovered function of ECs renders them excellent candidates for novel approaches in cell-based biologics. Here, we present a review of the role of ECs and angiocrine factors in some visceral tissues, followed by an overview of current cell-based approaches and a discussion of the potential applications of ECs in soft tissue repair.

Prompt and appropriate management is essential if we are to improve outcomes and reduce substandard care that may result in adverse consequences. This review describes the current understanding of the pathophysiological aspects of MOH together with the principles of transfusion and haemostatic therapy, with emphasis on a coordinated multidisciplinary approach. We also highlight the current lack of evidence available from randomized controlled trials to inform best practice and the need to prioritize research in this key clinical area.

AB  - Summary Hellmut Hartert was the first person to exploit the viscoelastic properties of clotting blood to measure blood coagulation in 1948. Since then, the technology has improved, allowing these analyses to be performed as point-of-care tests with immediately-available results. The addition of several activators and inhibitors to the original assay creates a panel of tests able to quantify the different aspects of blood clotting that can rival conventional laboratory assays. However, although much progress has been made, the standardization and validation of these tests still need improvement. Viscoelastic analyses of blood coagulation are mainly used to guide haemostatic therapy in bleeding patients and have proven superior to standard clotting tests in some circumstances. There is potential to extend their use to other areas, such as drug monitoring, and diagnosis and management of congenital bleeding disorders. The forthcoming cartridge-based assays are expected to improve the reliability and usability of viscoelastic assays of blood coagulation but high quality clinical trials remain urgently needed to determine their exact place, benefit and cost effectiveness.

Pregnancy-associated acquired haemophilia A: results from the European Acquired Haemophilia (EACH2) registry. BJOG 2012;119:1529?1537. Objective? The European Acquired Haemophilia registry (EACH2) collected data on the demographics, diagnosis, underlying disorders, bleeding characteristics, treatment, and outcome of women with acquired haemophilia A (AHA), a rare and often severe bleeding disorder caused by autoantibodies directed against coagulation factor VIII. Design? Prospective, multi-centre, large-scale, pan-European registry. Setting? A total of 117 haemophilia centres in 13 European countries. Population? Pregnancy-associated AHA. Methods? Data were reported using a web-based electronic case report form. Diagnosis was based on the presence of a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, reduced coagulation Factor VIII level and positive inhibitor assay. Main outcome measures? Presenting characteristics, time to diagnosis, haemostatic treatment and outcome, immunosuppressive treatment and outcome. Results? The EACH2 registry (n?=?501) documented 42 (8.4%) cases of AHA associated with the peripartum period, a median Factor VIII level at diagnosis of 2.5 (range 0?25)?IU/dl and inhibitor titre of 7.8 (range 0.7?348)?BU/ml. Antepartum inhibitors were evident in eight women. Time to diagnosis of AHA after delivery was 89 (range 21?120) days. First-line haemostatic treatment was successful in 20/23 (87%) women treated. Bleeding episodes resolved in 17/18 (94%) women treated with a bypassing agent and 29/39 (74%) women achieved complete remission with first-line immunosuppressive treatment. Two babies experienced postnatal bleeding, suggesting transplacental transfer of the antibody. All women were alive at last follow-up. Conclusions? Although rare, pregnancy-associated AHA may cause severe bleeding-related morbidity. Once diagnosed, women respond well to haemostatic treatment with bypassing agents and immunosuppression. Awareness of peripartum AHA requires improvement to facilitate rapid and appropriate management.

AB  - Abstract:  Objectives:? The aim of this study was to analyze short- and long-term results of liver transplantation (LT) in patients over 65?yr. Material and methods:? Between 1996 and 2004, 386 patients underwent 415 LT at our center. The main indication for LT was post-necrotic cirrhosis in 59%, followed by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) over cirrhosis in 33%. Half of the patients (53%) were hepatitis C virus (HCV) +. Overall, 72 patients were >65?yr of age. Actuarial survival, causes of mortality and postoperative complications were compared between groups: patients under and over 65?yr. Risk factors for poor outcome in patients over 65?yr were also analyzed. Results:? The older group had more patients at Child A stage, more HCC as an indication for LT and more HCV (+) patients, p?<?0.05. No differences were observed in donor and surgery characteristics, except for lower multi-transfusion and higher incidence of grafts with steatosis in the older group (p?<?0.05). Actuarial survival at one, three, five and 10 yr was 82%, 75%, 72%, and 70% for the <65?yr group vs. 77%, 66%, 55%, and 55% for the >65?yr group (p?=?0.03). Main causes of mortality in patients >65?yr were recurrence of underlying disease and medical causes. In the older age group, fewer infections (p?=?ns) and rejections (p?=?0.017) occurred in the postoperative period. Risk factor for poor outcome in the group of patients over 65?yr in multivariate analyses was pre-LT renal insufficiency (odds ratio 3.5, p?=?0.002, 95% confidence interval 1.58?7.82). Conclusion:? Results in patients >65?yr are comparable to those <65?yr if older LT candidates are carefully selected. Overimmunosuppression should be avoided in older candidates, as its effects could worsen the pre-existing diseases common in elderly patients.

AB  - Summary Sepsis occurs when an infection exceeds local tissue containment and induces a series of dysregulated physiologic responses that result in organ dysfunction. A subset of patients with sepsis progress to septic shock, defined by profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities, and associated with a greater mortality. Historically, sepsis-induced organ dysfunction and lethality were attributed to the complex interplay between the initial inflammatory and later anti-inflammatory responses. With advances in intensive care medicine and goal-directed interventions, early 30-day sepsis mortality has diminished, only to steadily escalate long after ?recovery? from acute events. As so many sepsis survivors succumb later to persistent, recurrent, nosocomial, and secondary infections, many investigators have turned their attention to the long-term sepsis-induced alterations in cellular immune function. Sepsis clearly alters the innate and adaptive immune responses for sustained periods of time after clinical recovery, with immune suppression, chronic inflammation, and persistence of bacterial representing such alterations. Understanding that sepsis-associated immune cell defects correlate with long-term mortality, more investigations have centered on the potential for immune modulatory therapy to improve long-term patient outcomes. These efforts are focused on more clearly defining and effectively reversing the persistent immune cell dysfunction associated with long-term sepsis mortality.

AB  - Macroscopic anatomy of the heart is evaluated best in living animals, because postmortal changes and the lack of the normal heart motion lead to misinterpretation. For the last 15?years functional cardiac imaging of animals has been performed by two-dimensional ultrasonography. However, three-dimensional echocardiography has multiple advantages over two-dimensional ultrasonography such as an improved assessment of the endocardial structures and the possibility of precise determination of the sonographic views for measurement. For these reasons the ultrasound system SONOS 7500 of Philips has been used for examinations since December 2003. These examinations were performed in healthy adult dogs of different sizes as well as in European Short Hair cats. Using a recently developed multi-frequent matrix array probe all regions of interest were directly on-line volume-rendered or represented in two exactly defined orthogonal views. Although the used matrix array probe was large, transthoracic left and right parasternal sonograms could be carried out without any problems in all small animals without sedation. For the first time the cardiac structures in dogs and cats such as the opening and closing of the left atrioventricular and aortic valves were represented within a 60?degrees?(15 or 30?degrees pyramidal volume. The morphology and the function of the atrioventricular leaflets could be evaluated exactly. For representation of a larger pyramidal volume or the three-dimensional simultaneous colour flow imaging, careful ECG gating is required. Unfortunately, the distinct respiratory arrhythmia in quiet dogs had a negative effect on the registration of four or eight heart cycles of the same length. Using biplane echocardiography the commonly represented sonographs for measurement were exactly determined. Additionally these techniques enabled the registration of new views for evaluation and measurements, which were not available from two-dimensional ultrasonography. This study has demonstrated for the first time that real time transthoracic three-dimensional echocardiography is feasible in dogs and cats and that it provides comprehensive visualization of the intracardiac anatomy in unique projections in living animals.

AB  - Vitamin E is a primary chain-breaking antioxidant that prevents cyclic propagation of lipid peroxidation. Across species, vitamin E is essential for normal neuromuscular function by acting as a potent antioxidant, as well as by modulating the expression of certain genes, inhibiting platelet aggregation and stabilizing plasma membranes. This review focuses on vitamin E structure, absorption, metabolism, current equine dietary recommendations, the interplay between antioxidants and exercise, a discussion of the necessity of vitamin E supplementation in the horse above the Nutritional Research Council (NRC) 2007 requirements, and a review of equine diseases that are associated with a vitamin E deficiency. Particular emphasis is placed on the proteins involved in vitamin E absorption, transport, and metabolism as potential candidates for vitamin E-associated diseases across species.
