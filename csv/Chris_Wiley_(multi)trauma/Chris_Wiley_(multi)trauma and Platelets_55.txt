AB  - Macroscopic anatomy of the heart is evaluated best in living animals, because postmortal changes and the lack of the normal heart motion lead to misinterpretation. For the last 15?years functional cardiac imaging of animals has been performed by two-dimensional ultrasonography. However, three-dimensional echocardiography has multiple advantages over two-dimensional ultrasonography such as an improved assessment of the endocardial structures and the possibility of precise determination of the sonographic views for measurement. For these reasons the ultrasound system SONOS 7500 of Philips has been used for examinations since December 2003. These examinations were performed in healthy adult dogs of different sizes as well as in European Short Hair cats. Using a recently developed multi-frequent matrix array probe all regions of interest were directly on-line volume-rendered or represented in two exactly defined orthogonal views. Although the used matrix array probe was large, transthoracic left and right parasternal sonograms could be carried out without any problems in all small animals without sedation. For the first time the cardiac structures in dogs and cats such as the opening and closing of the left atrioventricular and aortic valves were represented within a 60?degrees?(15 or 30?degrees pyramidal volume. The morphology and the function of the atrioventricular leaflets could be evaluated exactly. For representation of a larger pyramidal volume or the three-dimensional simultaneous colour flow imaging, careful ECG gating is required. Unfortunately, the distinct respiratory arrhythmia in quiet dogs had a negative effect on the registration of four or eight heart cycles of the same length. Using biplane echocardiography the commonly represented sonographs for measurement were exactly determined. Additionally these techniques enabled the registration of new views for evaluation and measurements, which were not available from two-dimensional ultrasonography. This study has demonstrated for the first time that real time transthoracic three-dimensional echocardiography is feasible in dogs and cats and that it provides comprehensive visualization of the intracardiac anatomy in unique projections in living animals.

AB  - Bone, as a mineralized composite of inorganic (mostly carbonated hydroxyapatite) and organic (mainly type I collagen) phases, possesses a unique combination of remarkable strength and toughness. Its excellent mechanical properties are related to its hierarchical structures and precise organization of the inorganic and organic phases at the nanoscale: Nanometer-sized hydroxyapatite crystals periodically deposit within the gap zones of collagen fibrils during bone biomineralization process. This hierarchical arrangement produces nanomechanical heterogeneities, which enable a mechanism for high energy dissipation and resistance to fracture. The excellent mechanical properties integrated with the hierarchical nanostructure of bone have inspired chemists and material scientists to develop biomimetic strategies for artificial bone grafts in tissue engineering (TE). This critical review provides a broad overview of the current mechanisms involved in bone biomineralization, and the relationship between bone hierarchical structures and the deformation mechanism. Our goal in this review is to inspire the application of these principles toward bone TE.

AB  - Abstract. In its classic hormonal role, erythropoietin (EPO) is produced by the kidney and regulates the number of erythrocytes within the circulation to provide adequate tissue oxygenation. EPO also mediates other effects directed towards optimizing oxygen delivery to tissues, e.g. modulating regional blood flow and reducing blood loss by promoting thrombosis within damaged vessels. Over the past 15?years, many unexpected nonhaematopoietic functions of EPO have been identified. In these more recently appreciated nonhormonal roles, locally-produced EPO signals through a different receptor isoform and is a major molecular component of the injury response, in which it counteracts the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Acutely, EPO prevents programmed cell death and reduces the development of secondary, pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced injury. Within a longer time frame, EPO provides trophic support to enable regeneration and healing. As the region immediately surrounding damage is typically relatively deficient in endogenous EPO, administration of recombinant EPO can provide increased tissue protection. However, effective use of EPO as therapy for tissue injury requires higher doses than for haematopoiesis, potentially triggering serious adverse effects. The identification of a tissue-protective receptor isoform has facilitated the engineering of nonhaematopoietic, tissue-protective EPO derivatives, e.g. carbamyl EPO, that avoid these complications. Recently, regions within the EPO molecule mediating tissue protection have been identified and this has enabled the development of potent tissue-protective peptides, including some mimicking EPO?s tertiary structure but unrelated in primary sequence.

AB  - Book reviews in this article: Intravascular catheterization is a commonly used diagnostic tool and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is used to dilate stenosed blood vessels. Although these techniques are very successful diagnostically and therapeutically they may precipitate a number of acute and chronic complications. Chronic intimal changes following balloon angioplasty can result in re-stenosis. Intimal hyperplasia can be a long-term complication of both diagnostic and interventional vascular catheterization. This article details these long-term structural changes, specifically relating experimental in vivo and in vitro changes to those seen clinically.

AB  - ABSTRACT Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a fatal thrombohemorrhagic disorder. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are multipotent stem cells that have tremendous therapeutic effect. Our aim was to explore whether the immune mechanisms were associated with BMSCs-afforded protection against DIC. We generated a rat model of DIC by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 3?mg/kg) injection via the tail vein. In the treatment group, rats were pre-treated with 1???l03, 1???l04, 1???l05, and 1???l06 allogeneic BMSCs before LPS injection. Blood sample was withdrawn from the abdominal aorta at 0 (before), 4, and 8?h after LPS injection and used for biochemical analyses. After experiments, the mice were sacrificed and their organs were harvested and observed by H&E and PTAH staining. Continuous infusion of LPS into the rats gradually impaired the hemostatic parameters and damaged organ functions. However, pre-treatment with BMSCs dose-dependently improved the hemostatic parameters. Meanwhile, the treatment significantly suppressed the fibrin microthrombi formation and alleviated liver, heart, lung, and renal injuries. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that BMSCs pre-treatment inhibited LPS-induced upregulation of CD3+CD8+ T cells and CD3+/CD161a+ NKT cells in the peripheral blood. BMSCs pre-treatment reversed the upregualtion of the B-cell population and the percentage of CD43+/CD172a+ monocytes in the DIC models. Finally, BMSCs pre-treatment decreased the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-? (IFN-?), interleukin-1? (IL-1?), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and increased the levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in LPS-induced DIC models. Pre-treatment with BMSCs can reduce coagulation and alleviate organ dysfunction via peripheral immune responses in LPS-induced DIC rat model. J. Cell.

AB  - Essentials How best to quantify thrombosis risk with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) is unknown. Data from a registry were used to develop the Michigan Risk Score (MRS) for PICC thrombosis. Five risk factors were associated with PICC thrombosis and used to develop a risk score. MRS was predictive of the risk of PICC thrombosis and can be useful in clinical practice. Summary Background Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are associated with upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). We developed a score to predict risk of PICC-related thrombosis. Methods Using data from the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium, image-confirmed upper-extremity DVT cases were identified. A logistic, mixed-effects model with hospital-specific random intercepts was used to identify factors associated with PICC-DVT. Points were assigned to each predictor, stratifying patients into four classes of risk. Internal validation was performed by bootstrapping with assessment of calibration and discrimination of the model. Results Of 23 010 patients who received PICCs, 475 (2.1%) developed symptomatic PICC-DVT. Risk factors associated with PICC-DVT included: history of DVT; multi-lumen PICC; active cancer; presence of another CVC when the PICC was placed; and white blood cell count greater than 12 000. Four risk classes were created based on thrombosis risk. Thrombosis rates were 0.9% for class I, 1.6% for class II, 2.7% for class III and 4.7% for class IV, with marginal predicted probabilities of 0.9% (0.7, 1.2), 1.5% (1.2, 1.9), 2.6% (2.2, 3.0) and 4.5% (3.7, 5.4) for classes I, II, III, and IV, respectively. The risk classification rule was strongly associated with PICC-DVT, with odds ratios of 1.68 (95% CI, 1.19, 2.37), 2.90 (95% CI, 2.09, 4.01) and 5.20 (95% CI, 3.65, 7.42) for risk classes II, III and IV vs. risk class I, respectively. Conclusion The Michigan PICC-DVT Risk Score offers a novel way to estimate risk of DVT associated with PICCs and can help inform appropriateness of PICC insertion.

AB  - Summary Treatment of haemophilia A patients with inhibitors is challenging, and may require individually tailored regimens. Whereas low titre inhibitor patients may respond to high doses of factor VIII (FVIII), high-responding inhibitor patients render replacement therapy ineffective and often require application of bypassing agents. Thrombin generation (TG) assays may be used to monitor haemostasis and/or predict patients' response to bypass agents. In this study we defined by TG, the potential contribution of FVIII to recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa)-induced haemostasis in inhibitor plasma. Based upon results, prospectively designed individual regimens of coadministration of rFVIIa and FVIII were applied. Plasma samples from 14 haemophilia patients with inhibitors (including high titre inhibitors) were tested. The response to increasing concentrations of FVIII, rFVIIa or both was assayed by TG. Eight patients, chosen following consent and at physician's discretion, comprised the combined FVIII?rFVIIa therapy clinical study cohort. Combined spiking with FVIII/rFVIIa improved TG induced by rFVIIa alone in all inhibitor plasmas. Combined rFVIIa and FVIII therapy was applied during bleeding or immune tolerance to eight patients, for a total of 393 episodes. Following a single combined dose, 90% haemostasis was documented and neither thrombosis nor any complications evolved. During study period decline of inhibitor levels and bleeding frequency were noted. Pre-analytical studies enabled us to prospectively tailor individual therapy regimens. We confirmed for the first time that the in vitro advantage of combining FVIII and rFVIIa, indeed accounts for improved haemostasis and may safely be applied to inhibitor patients.

AB  - Abstract Repair and regeneration of articular cartilage lesions have always been a major challenge in the medical field due to its peculiar structure (e.g., sparsely distributed chondrocytes, no blood supply, no nerves). Articular cartilage tissue engineering is considered as one promising strategy to achieve reconstruction of cartilage. With this perspective, the articular cartilage tissue engineering has been widely studied. Here, the recent progress of articular cartilage tissue engineering is reviewed. The ad hoc therapeutic cells and growth factors for cartilage regeneration are summarized and discussed. Various types of bio/macromolecular scaffolds together with their pros and cons are also reviewed and elaborated.

AB  - Purpose? Complications of free tissue transfer often are mentioned only in passing, be it in a forum or published literature. Minor details as discussed in this presentation are often are not emphasized and occasionally neglected. Materials and methods? Of the 75 consecutive cases, majority were for head and neck reconstruction. Specific factors that are discussed are 1. Pedicle twist and precautions on perforator flaps 2. Pedicle in a tunnel- how wide is safe. 3. One vein versus two veins ? when to choose 4. Could the beginner initiate his microsurgery on the second comitant vein? Are there alternatives to a safer teaching model? 5. Precautions in choosing recipient vessels in traumatic limbs with disuse atrophy 6. ?Distal run off?? distance of freeing the recipient vessels. Other issues discussed are, prevention of vessel desiccation, precautions with hemoclips; pharmacotherapy versus re exploration, and rare causes of failure such as drug hit phenomenon. Results? Among 75 free flaps, the ALT flap was the workhorse. Others included the radial forearm, fibula, Latissimus dorsi and gracilis. Of the 7 re-explorations 3 had pharmacotherapy as the first intervention. There were 4 complete failures, 2-partial failures, 1-complete salvage. Overall success rate was 90%. Conclusions? Success comes with good decisions; good decisions come with experience, though experience come with bad decisions. The factors discussed here aim to share the bad experiences that could be diligently avoided to obtain higher success rates.

Describe options of systemic treatment of refractory meningiomas with hydroxyurea, somatostatin analogues, or CAV multi-agent chemotherapy. This article is available for continuing medical education credit at CME.TheOncologist.com Although meningiomas are the most common tumor in the central nervous system, their incidence, epidemiology, and clinical outcomes have historically been poorly defined. This has been attributed to their benign course, difficulty obtaining histologic diagnosis, and lack of uniform database registration. Their clinical behavior can range from a silent incidentaloma to a lethal tumor. Projections of an aging population should raise medical awareness of an expectant rise in the incidence of meningiomas. This disease increases with advancing age, has a female predilection, and exposure to ionizing radiation is associated with a higher risk for disease development. There have been minimal advances in treatment, except in radiation therapy. Although no U.S. Food and Drug Administration?approved systemic therapy exists, there are treatment options that include hydroxyurea and sandostatin. Currently, no molecularly targeted therapy has provided clinical benefit, although recurring molecular alterations are present and novel therapies are being investigated.

AB  - Summary This chapter deals with those syndromes whose primary symptomatology is characterized by acquired impairments in one or more cognitive domains. Under DSM-5, these syndromes are collectively referred to as the ?Neurocognitive Disorders.? In the chapter, under ?Major Neurocognitive Disorder,? the syndromes of dementia and amnestic disorder are treated separately. After treating delirium, major neurocognitive disorder (including dementia and amnestic disorder), and minor neurocognitive disorder, the chapter turns to a number of disorders, each considered in DSM-5, which, if merely mild, may cause a minor neurocognitive disorder and which, if more severe, may cause a major neurocognitive disorder. These disorders include: Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Lewy body disease, vascular disease, traumatic brain injury, substance-induced neurocognitive disorders (e.g., alcoholic dementia), HIV infection, prion diseases (e.g., Creutzfeldt?Jakob disease), Parkinson's disease and, finally, Huntington's disease.
