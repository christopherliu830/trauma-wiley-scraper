AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to illustrate the baseline appearance and enhancement patterns of splenic hemangiomas on contrast-enhanced sonography. Methods Two experienced radiologists retrospectively reviewed by consensus baseline and contrast-enhanced sonographic examinations of 27 patients (14 women and 13 men; mean age, 58.7 years) with 27 splenic hemangiomas (mean size, 2 cm) confirmed by splenectomy, biopsy, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging and follow-up. Results On baseline sonography, 77.8% of the lesions showed a homogeneous echo texture that was mainly hyperechoic. Color Doppler imaging did not show any signal in 81.5% of the cases. After contrast agent injection, 59.2% of the splenic hemangiomas showed different degrees of contrast enhancement in the arterial phase followed by isoenhancement in the late parenchymal phase. Among these, 2 hemangiomas showed peripheral globular enhancement in the arterial phase, followed by progressive centripetal fill-in. In 29.6% of the cases, some degree of contrast enhancement was appreciable, but the hemangiomas remained substantially hypoechoic throughout the contrast-enhanced sonographic examinations, whereas in 11.1%, the combination of contrast enhancement in the arterial phase followed by wash-out in the late parenchymal phase was evident. Conclusions Isoechogenicity to spleen parenchyma in all phases is the most frequent typical enhancement pattern of splenic hemangiomas observed on contrast-enhanced sonography. Nevertheless, these lesions may show atypical contrast enhancement patterns; therefore, further assessment with cross-sectional techniques is needed.

AB  - Abstract? The association of pancreatic disorders with fat necrosis in domestic animals is rare. This report concerns a case of cutaneous/subcutaneous necrotizing panniculitis and steatitis associated with a pancreatic adenocarcinoma in an 11-year-old male Siamese cat. Clinical investigation revealed variably sized nodules on the trunk, limbs and abdomen. Some of them were ulcerated; others showed a shiny yellow necrotic background featuring irregular sinus tracts. The cat was euthanized at the owner's request before a diagnosis could be made. At necropsy, abundant oily material resembling mustard replaced the subcutaneous tissue and small yellow nodules were disseminated in the omentum, mesentery and serosa of the abdomen. A multilobulated mass arising from the anterior pancreatic head was found along with liver and lymph node metastasis. Histopathology showed wide fistulous tracts draining necrotic fat from the subcutis toward the surface and multifocal areas of necrotic adipocytes replacing the panniculus. Duct-like structures and tubules lined by neoplastic epithelial cells were observed in the primary pancreatic tumour and in the metastatic sites. The aetiology of the fat necrosis was possibly the result of systemic release of lipolytic pancreatic enzymes.

AB  - Summary The past few decades have seen major advances in multidisciplinary obstetric care and management of gynecological conditions in women with bleeding disorders. Awareness of the impact of bleeding disorders has improved among the obstetric and gynecological community. Undiagnosed bleeding disorders can be the underlying cause for a significant proportion of women with heavy menstrual bleeding. They may also be the cause or a contributory factor for other gynecological problems, such as dysmenorrhea, intermenstrual bleeding, and endometriosis. Hemostatic assessment should be considered in women referred for menstrual abnormalities if they have a positive bleeding history as quantified by bleeding assessment tools. The reproductive choices and options for prenatal diagnosis are also expanding for families with hemophilia with a drive toward achieving a non-invasive approach. Current non-invasive prenatal diagnostic techniques are limited to identification of fetal gender. Research is ongoing to overcome the specific diagnostic challenges of identifying hemophilia mutations, utilizing free fetal DNA circulating in maternal plasma. The management of obstetric hemorrhage has recently evolved to include a greater focus on the identification of and early treatment for coagulation disorders. Deficiencies in certain hemostatic variables are associated with progression to more severe bleeding; therefore, specific interventions have been proposed to target this. Evidence is still lacking to support such strategy, and future research is required to assess the efficacy and the safety of these hemostatic interventions in women with persistent PPH.

AB  - Summary.? Excessive bleeding after cardiac surgery can result in increased morbidity and mortality related to transfusion- and hypoperfusion-related injuries to critical organ systems. Our objective was to review mechanisms that result in bleeding after cardiac surgery as well as current and emerging interventions to reduce bleeding and transfusion. We discovered that of point-of-care (POC) tests of hemostatic function can facilitate the optimal management of excessive bleeding and reduce transfusion by facilitating administration of specific pharmacologic or transfusion-based therapy and by allowing physicians to better differentiate between microvascular bleeding and surgical bleeding. Emerging interventions like recombinant FVIIa have the potential to reduce bleeding and transfusion-related sequelae and may be life-saving; however, randomized, controlled trials are needed to confirm safety before they can be used as either first-line therapies for bleeding or bleeding prophylaxis. In conclusion, careful investigation of the role of new interventions is essential as the ability to reduce use of blood products, to decrease operative time and/or re-exploration rates has important implications for overall patient safety and health care costs.
