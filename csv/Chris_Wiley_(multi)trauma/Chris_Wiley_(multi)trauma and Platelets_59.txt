AB  - Summary.? Excessive bleeding after cardiac surgery can result in increased morbidity and mortality related to transfusion- and hypoperfusion-related injuries to critical organ systems. Our objective was to review mechanisms that result in bleeding after cardiac surgery as well as current and emerging interventions to reduce bleeding and transfusion. We discovered that of point-of-care (POC) tests of hemostatic function can facilitate the optimal management of excessive bleeding and reduce transfusion by facilitating administration of specific pharmacologic or transfusion-based therapy and by allowing physicians to better differentiate between microvascular bleeding and surgical bleeding. Emerging interventions like recombinant FVIIa have the potential to reduce bleeding and transfusion-related sequelae and may be life-saving; however, randomized, controlled trials are needed to confirm safety before they can be used as either first-line therapies for bleeding or bleeding prophylaxis. In conclusion, careful investigation of the role of new interventions is essential as the ability to reduce use of blood products, to decrease operative time and/or re-exploration rates has important implications for overall patient safety and health care costs.

AB  - Wound healing is a complex and dynamic process that involves the mediation of many initiators effective during the healing process such as cytokines, macrophages and fibroblasts. In addition, the defence mechanism of the body undergoes a step-by-step but continuous process known as the wound healing cascade to ensure optimal healing. Thus, when designing a wound healing system or dressing, it is pivotal that key factors such as optimal gaseous exchange, a moist wound environment, prevention of microbial activity and absorption of exudates are considered. A variety of wound dressings are available, however, not all meet the specific requirements of an ideal wound healing system to consider every aspect within the wound healing cascade. Recent research has focussed on the development of smart polymeric materials. Combining biopolymers that are crucial for wound healing may provide opportunities to synthesise matrices that are inductive to cells and that stimulate and trigger target cell responses crucial to the wound healing process. This review therefore outlines the processes involved in skin regeneration, optimal management and care required for wound treatment. It also assimilates, explores and discusses wound healing drug-delivery systems and nanotechnologies utilised for enhanced wound healing applications. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 103:2211?2230, 2014

AB  - Abstract This Progress Report reviews recent advances in the utility of extracellular matrix (ECM)-mimic biomaterials in presenting and delivering therapeutic cells to promote tissue healing. This overview gives a brief introduction of different cell types being used in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering while addressing critical issues that must be overcome before cell-based approaches can be routinely employed in the clinic. A selection of five commonly used cell-associated, biomaterial platforms (collagen, hyaluronic acid, fibrin, alginate, and poly(ethylene glycol)) are reviewed for treatment of a number of acute injury or diseases with emphasis on animal models and clinical trials. This article concludes with current challenges and future perspectives regarding foreign body host response to biomaterials and immunological reactions to allogeneic or xenogeneic cells, vascularization and angiogenesis, matching mechanical strength and anisotropy of native tissues, as well as other non-technical issues regarding the clinical translation of biomatrix/cell-based therapies.

AB  - In adults, acute lung injury or adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may complicate a wide range of serious medical and surgical conditions, only some of which involve direct pulmonary insult. The characteristic histological feature of ARDS is an intense inflammatory process in the lungs, which may progress to fibrosis. The earliest physiological characteristic is an increase in the protein permeability across the endothelial and epithelial barriers of the lungs. This clinical syndrome is characterized by arterial hypoxaemia and bilateral radiographic infiltrates, which represent protein-rich oedema fluid. In addition there is a neutrophilic and macrophage infiltrate. ?Pulmonary endothelium is actively involved in the development of ARDS. It alters cell?cell adhesion as the initial step in leucocyte migration which, in turn, changes the permeability that allows protein-rich fluid to move into the interstitium. The quantity of this interstitial oedema may be sufficient to cause bulk flow through the epithelial barrier. There is probably independent epithelial injury. Finally, the endothelium can release and metabolize vasoactive and inflammatory substances, such as endothelins, nitric oxide and cytokines, etc. No single substance is responsible for acute lung injury, but rather a complex interplay exists between diverse pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators.
