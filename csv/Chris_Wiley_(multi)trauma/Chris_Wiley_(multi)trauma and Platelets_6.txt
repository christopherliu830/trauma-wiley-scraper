AB  - ABSTRACT Lateral epicondylitis (LE) is difficult to manage and can result in significant patient morbidity. Currently, the clinical use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for painful tendons has received attention, but its efficacy remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate the clinical effects of PRP and its biological components. A total of 156 patients with LE were randomly divided into group 1, treated with a single injection of 2-ml autologous PRP, and group 2, treated with a control received only physical therapy without injection. Both groups used a tennis elbow strap and performed stretching and strengthening exercises during 24 weeks? follow-up. Pain and functional improvements were assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS), Modified Mayo Clinic Performance Index for the elbow, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). White blood cell count, platelet count, and levels of platelet-derived growth factor-AB (PDGF-AB), PDGF-BB, transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?), vascular endothelial growth factor, epithelial growth factor, and interleukin-1 ? in PRP were measured and investigated for statistical correlation with the clinical score. At 24 weeks, all pain and functional variables, including VAS score, Mayo Clinic performance scores, and MRI grade, improved significantly in group 1 (p?<?0.05). PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, and TGF-? levels were more significantly increased in PRP than in whole blood. TGF-? level significantly correlated with Mayo Clinic performance score and MRI grade improvement. Thus, TGF-? level in PRP is considered to play a pivotal role in tendon healing. These results may contribute to identifying the best protocol for PRP application in tendinopathies. ? 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND Although a majority of the studies conducted to date on platelet (PLT) storage have been focused on PLT hemostatic function, the effects of 4°C PLTs on regulation of endothelial barrier permeability are still not known. In this study, we compared the effects of room temperature (22°C) stored and (4°C) stored PLTs on the regulation of vascular endothelial cell (EC) permeability in vitro and in vivo. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Day 1, Day 5, and Day 7 leukoreduced apheresis PLTs stored at 4 or 22°C were studied in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, PLT effects on EC permeability and barrier function, adhesion, and impedance aggregometry were investigated. In vivo, using a mouse model of vascular leak, attenuation of vascular leak and circulating PLT numbers were measured. RESULTS Treatment of EC monolayers with Day 5 or Day 7 PLTs, stored at both 22°C and 4°C, resulted in similar decreases in EC permeability on average. However, analysis of individual samples revealed significant variation that was donor dependent. Additional in vitro measurements revealed a decrease in inflammatory mediators, nonspecific PLT-endothelial aggregation and attenuated loss of aggregation over time to TRAP, ASPI, ADP, and collagen with 4°C storage. In mice, while 22°C and 4°C PLTs both demonstrated significant protection against vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A)-induced vascular leak 22°C PLTs exhibited increased protection compared to 4°C PLTs. Systemic circulating levels of 4°C PLTs were decreased compared to 22°C PLTs. CONCLUSIONS In vitro, 4°C-stored PLTs exhibit a greater capacity to inhibit EC permeability than 22°C-stored PLTs. In vivo, 22°C PLTs provide superior control of vascular leak induced by VEGF-A. This discrepancy may be due to increased clearance of 4°C PLTs from the systemic circulation.

AB  - Abstract We have previously reported neuroprotection in spinal cord injury (SCI) by Lipitor [atorvastatin (AT)]-pre-treatment. Though informative, pre-treatment studies find only limited clinical application as trauma occurrence is unpredictable. Therefore, this study investigates the efficacy of AT treatment post-SCI. In a rat model of contusion-SCI resulting in complete hindlimb paralysis, AT treatment (5?mg/kg; gavage) was begun 2, 4, or 6?h post-SCI followed by a once daily dose thereafter for 6?weeks. While the placebo vehicle (VHC)-SCI rats showed substantial functional deficit, AT-SCI animals exhibited significant functional recovery. AT diminished injury-induced blood?spinal cord barrier (BSCB) dysfunction with significantly reduced infiltration and tumor necrosis factor-α/interleukin-1?/inducible nitric oxide synthase expression at site of injury. BSCB protection in AT-SCI was attributable to attenuated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) expression ? a central player in BSCB disruption. Furthermore, endothelial MMP9 expression was found to be RhoA/ROCK pathway-mediated and regulated by AT through an isoprenoid-dependent mechanism. Attenuation of these early inflammatory events reduced secondary damage. Significant reduction in axonal degeneration, myelin degradation, gliosis, and neuronal apoptosis with resultant enhancement in tissue sparing was observed in AT-SCI compared with VHC-SCI. In summary, this novel report presenting the efficacy of post-injury AT treatment might be of critical therapeutic value as effective treatments are currently unavailable for SCI.

AB  - Some adverse reactions to the transfusion of platelet concentrates (PCs) cannot be attributed to antibodies against blood cells or to subclinical microbial agents. It has been suggested that leucocyte-derived inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) may contribute to a large number of unexplained non-antibody-mediated adverse reactions. Three types of PCs, containing different levels of leucocytes, are currently produced. Filtration is used on demand to further reduce leucocyte contamination of these components. We have monitored the plasma of PCs prepared by the platelet-rich plasma method (PRP), the buffy-coat method or by apheresis for IL-6, IL-1, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-?), TNF and interferon ? (IFN?). Biologically active IL-6 increased in stored PRP-PCs from a mean of 140?pg/ml on day 1 to 2395?pg/ml on day 5/6. Elevated levels of IL-8, as detected by immunoassay, were evident in PRP-PCs during routine storage under blood bank conditions. Small amounts of immunoreactive IL-1 with only minimal biological activity were present in some PRP-PCs by day 5/6. No significant increase in the levels of IL-8, IL-6 or IL-1 were seen in buffy-coat PCs during storage for 5/6?d. For apheresis PCs, an increase in IL-8 content, but not in IL-6 over 6?d was observed. In all three types of PCs, elevated amounts of both bioactive and immunoreactive TGF? were present, but there was no evidence of any biologically active or immunoreactive TNFα. Pre-storage filtration of PRP-PCs for depletion of leucocytes prevented the increase in IL-8 and IL-6 levels of these PCs. Our results show that leucocyte reduction by buffy-coat method reduces cytokine levels to a comparable level to filtered or apheresis PCs, containing low levels of leucocytes, but use of these PCs in minimizing the severity and incidence of reactions in recipients will require clinical evaluation. This is the first comprehensive and comparative study which, on the basis of biological activity of cytokines, directly indicates that the mode of platelet production grossly influences the levels of cytokines.

AB  - Summary Efficient early identification of primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) is important for prognosis, but is not an easy task for non-immunologists. The Clinical Working Party of the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) has composed a multi-stage diagnostic protocol that is based on expert opinion, in order to increase the awareness of PID among doctors working in different fields. The protocol starts from the clinical presentation of the patient; immunological skills are not needed for its use. The multi-stage design allows cost-effective screening for PID within the large pool of potential cases in all hospitals in the early phases, while more expensive tests are reserved for definitive classification in collaboration with an immunologist at a later stage. Although many PIDs present in childhood, others may present at any age. The protocols presented here are therefore aimed at both adult physicians and paediatricians. While designed for use throughout Europe, there will be national differences which may make modification of this generic algorithm necessary.

AB  - Background In ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI), current oral P2Y12 platelet inhibitors do not provide maximal platelet inhibition at the time of reperfusion. Furthermore, administration of cangrelor prior to reperfusion has been shown in pre-clinical studies to reduce myocardial infarct (MI) size. Therefore, we hypothesize that cangrelor administered prior to reperfusion in STEMI patients will reduce the incidence of microvascular obstruction (MVO) and limit MI size in STEMI patients treated with PPCI. Methods The platelet inhibition to target reperfusion injury (PITRI) trial, is a phase 2A, multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial, in which 210 STEMI patients will be randomized to receive either an intravenous (IV) bolus of cangrelor (30 ?g/kg) followed by a 120-minute infusion (4 ?g/kg/min) or matching saline placebo, initiated prior to reperfusion (NCT03102723). Results The study started in October 2017 and the anticipated end date would be July 2020. The primary end-point will be MI size quantified by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) on day 3 post-PPCI. Secondary endpoints will include markers of reperfusion, incidence of MVO, MI size, and adverse left ventricular remodeling at 6 months, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. Summary The aim of the PITRI trial is to assess whether cangrelor administered prior to reperfusion would reduce acute MI size and MVO, as assessed by CMR.

AB  - Summary. Background:? Orthopedic surgery, especially total knee and total hip arthroplasty, is considered a risk factor for peri-operative venous thromboembolism. Objectives:? This study evaluates how accelerated inflammatogenic cellular interactions and the subsequent production of tissue factor and CD40 ligand play an important role in the pathogenesis of venous thromboembolism. Patients and methods:? Twenty-four patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were randomly assigned to groups with (Ti; n?=?12) and without (Tn; n?=?12) pneumatic tourniquet inflation. Results:? Numbers of leukocyte-platelet aggregates, especially those comprising monocytes-platelets in central venous blood from the Ti group, were increased during the peri-operative period (P?<?0.01), and returned to the baseline level at 24?h after starting surgery. Levels of PAC-1, P-selectin, CD40 ligand, tissue factor, Mac-1 expression on monocytes including monocyte-platelet aggregates, and the number of microparticles including those of endothelial cell origin were noticeably increased in central venous blood from the Ti group (P?<?0.01). Whole blood coagulability was also obviously increased in central venous blood from the Ti group (P?<?0.01). Furthermore, the concentrations of venous plasma tissue factor antigen, CD40 ligand, platelet factor 4, ?-thromboglobulin, the soluble fibrin monomer complex and prothrombin fragment 1+2 were also increased (P?<?0.05). Conclusions:? This study showed that platelet, leukocyte and endothelium activities as well as their interactions are enhanced during the peri-operative period of total knee arthroplasty, particularly in venous blood from the lower half of the body, which consequently augments blood coagulability. Further, tourniquet inflation during surgery exaggerates these responses.

AB  - ABSTRACT Mutations in FLNA (Filamin A, OMIM 300017) cause X-linked periventricular nodular heterotopia (XL-PNH). XL-PNH-associated mutations are considered lethal in hemizygous males. However, a few males with unusual mutations (including distal truncating and hypomorphic missense mutations), and somatic mosaicism have been reported to survive past infancy. Two brothers had an atypical presentation with failure to thrive and distinct facial appearance including hypertelorism. Evaluations of these brothers and their affected cousin showed systemic involvement including severe intestinal malfunction, malrotation, congenital short bowel, PNH, pyloric stenosis, wandering spleen, patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect, inguinal hernia, and vesicoureteral reflux. The unanticipated finding of PNH led to FLNA testing and subsequent identification of a novel no-stop FLNA mutation (c.7941_7942delCT, p.(*2648Serext*100)). Western blotting and qRT-PCR of patients' fibroblasts showed diminished levels of protein and mRNA. This FLNA mutation, the most distal reported so far, causes in females classical XL-PNH, but in males an unusual, multi-organ phenotype, providing a unique insight into the FLNA-associated phenotypes. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, cases were selected based on histologic or cytologic diagnosis of lymphoma, T-cell phenotype, hypercalcaemia, or both, and no previous chemotherapy for lymphoma. Treatment was not randomly allocated. Results Seventy-three dogs were included in this study: 50 in the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone group and 23 in the mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine group. The median progression-free survival was 133?days for dogs in the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone group and 97?days for dogs in the mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine group. When golden retrievers (n?=?16) were evaluated ?separately, progression-free survival was longer in the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone versus mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine treatment group (median PFS 154?days versus 70.5 days, respectively). Clinical Significance The progression-free survival time for dogs with multi-centric T-cell lymphoma treated with a modified mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine protocol was similar to that of dogs treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone. Further studies, including those evaluating golden retrievers separately, are needed to confirm these findings.

Material and Methods: In this paper, we report a case of severe bleeding following non-surgical periodontal procedures in a patient treated with a dual anti-platelet regimen post-coronary stent insertion. Results: Her medical history included ischaemic heart disease, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Haemostasis was achieved at the conclusion of the non-surgical periodontal treatment. However, several hours later, the patient arrived at the emergency room and was diagnosed with hypovolemic shock. Conclusion: This case should raise the clinician's awareness of bleeding complications in non-surgical procedures as well as the risk for bleeding when a dual anti-platelet regimen is administered. The importance of patient monitoring and the use of local haemostatic agents is demonstrated in these cases.

AB  - Introduction: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in dogs with urinary catheters in intensive care units (ICUs) are frequent. Historically, multi-drug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli account for about 10% of the UTIs. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of E. coli infections and of MDR E. coli in dogs with UTIs in our ICU, and to assess whether the MDR E. coli were community-acquired or nosocomial in origin. Methods: Over a 1-year period, rectal swabs were taken from all dogs in the ICU on the day of admission (D0) and on days 3 (D3), 6 (D6), 9 (D9) and 12 (D12). Urine was collected on these days from dogs with an indwelling urinary catheter (n=190). Rectal swabs and urine were routinely cultured. E. coli isolates were identified by biochemical tests. Using NCCLS guidelines, antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by disk diffusion method on fecal and urinary E. coli isolates. Twelve antimicrobial agents were used: nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin, and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to compare MDR E. coli UTI strains with fecal E. coli strains from the same patient and with MDR fecal E. coli from patients that were adjacent to, or housed in the same cages. Results: E. coli was cultured from 12 (48%) of 25 UTIs. Two of the E. coli were MDR. For one dog, PFGE showed no similarities among fecal E. coli and the urinary MDR E. coli isolates from the patient or between these isolates and fecal E. coli from a dog housed in the same kennel on the previous day. The MDR E. coli UTI was likely acquired prior to admission to the ICU, as it was present on D0. For the other dog, PFGE showed genetic similarity but not complete identity between the D3 MDR E. coli urinary isolate and the D3, D6, D9 fecal MDR isolates. This suggests that the UTI originated with the fecal E. coli. Using selective plates, fecal MDR E. coli were not found on D0. Selection of the MDR strain in the intestine by the use of antibiotics occurred while the dog was in the ICU and possibly led to the UTI. Conclusions: Multi-drug resistant E. coli accounted for 2 of 12 E. coli UTIs in dogs in the ICU over a 1-year period. Genotyping showed that one of the two MDR E. coli infections could possibly be of nosocomial origin.

AB  - BACKGROUND The use of male-donor-predominant plasma has reduced the risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), but the possible benefit of different mitigation strategies for other components is unknown. We evaluated the risk of TRALI from apheresis platelets (PLTs) to predict the effect of selectively testing female plateletpheresis donors who have been pregnant for HLA antibodies. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The American Red Cross hemovigilance program classified TRALI cases from apheresis PLTs or red blood cells (RBCs) in 2006 to 2013 or from predominantly male-donor (>95%) plasma in 2008 to 2013 and compared the component-specific TRALI rates. RESULTS The overall rate of TRALI was significantly higher for apheresis PLTs (6.2 cases per 106 units; OR [95% CI], 3.3 [2.3-4.8]) or plasma (3.8 cases per 106 units; OR [95% CI], 2.0 [1.4-2.9]) compared to RBCs (1.9 per 106 units). Twenty-nine of the 41 apheresis PLT cases involved female donors; 28 had been pregnant, and one had not been pregnant and was not tested. Twenty-five (61%) of the apheresis PLT TRALI cases had female donors with HLA Class I or Class II antibodies. In five of six cases that implicated specific HNA antibodies, the female parous donors also had multiple HLA antibodies. CONCLUSIONS TRALI was more likely after transfusion of apheresis PLTs than male-donor-predominant plasma or RBCs. A selective strategy to test all female plateletpheresis donors who have been pregnant for HLA antibodies might reduce the risk of TRALI by approximately 60% and prevent some cases from coexisting HNA antibodies.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered as emergent ?universal? cells and various tissue repair programs using MSCs are in development. In vitro expansion of MSCs is conventionally achieved in medium containing fetal calf serum (FCS) and is increased by addition of growth factors. However, for widespread clinical applications, contact of MSCs with FCS must be minimized since it is a putative source of prion or virus transmission. Therefore, because platelets are a natural source of growth factors, we sought to investigate in vitro MSC expansion in response to platelet lysates (PL) obtained from platelet-rich plasma. Human MSCs were expanded in FCS (±bFGF)- or PL-supplemented medium through a process of subculture. We demonstrated that PL-containing medium is enriched by growth factors (platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor (TGF-?), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)??) and showed that PL is able to promote MSC expansion, to decrease the time required to reach confluence, and to increase CFU-F size, as compared to the FCS medium. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MSCs cultured in the presence of PL maintain their osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic differentiation properties and retain their immunosuppressive activity. Therefore, we propose that PL may be a powerful and safe substitute for FCS in development of tissue- and cellular-engineered products in clinical settings using MSCs. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - After major trauma, the human immune system initiates a series of inflammatory events at the injury site that is later followed by suppression of local inflammation favoring the repair and remodeling of the damaged tissues. This local immune response involves complex interactions between resident cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, soluble mediators such as cytokines and chemokines, and recruited cells such as neutrophils, monocytes and mesenchymal stromal cells. If of sufficient magnitude, these initial immune responses nevertheless have systemic consequences resulting in a state called post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI). However, controversy exists regarding the exact immunological changes occurring in systemic compartments triggered by these local immune responses. PTI is one of the leading causes of post-surgical mortality and makes patients vulnerable to hospital-acquired infections, multiple organ failure and many other complications. In addition, hemorrhage, blood transfusion, immunesenescence and immunosuppressant drugs aggravate PTI. PTI has been intensively studied, but published results are frequently cloudy. The purpose of this review is to focus on the contributions made by different responsive modalities to immunosuppression following sterile trauma and to try to integrate these into an overall scheme of PTI.

AB  - Platelet-expressed GPCRs are critical regulators of platelet function. Pharmacological blockade of these receptors forms a powerful therapeutic tool in the treatment and prevention of arterial thrombosis associated with coronary atherosclerosis and ischaemic stroke. However, anti-thrombotic drug therapy is associated with high inter-patient variability in therapeutic response and adverse bleeding side effects. In order to optimize the use of existing anti-platelet drugs and to develop new therapies, more detailed knowledge is required relating to the molecular mechanisms that regulate GPCR and therefore platelet function. One approach has been to identify rare, function-disrupting mutations within key platelet proteins in patients with bleeding disorders. In this review, we describe how an integrated functional genomics strategy has contributed important structure-function information about platelet GPCRs with specific emphasis upon purinergic and thromboxane A2 receptors. We also discuss the potential implications these findings have for pharmacotherapy and for understanding the molecular basis of mild bleeding disorders.
