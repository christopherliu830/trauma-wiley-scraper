AB  - ABSTRACT Progressive knee joint degeneration occurs following removal of a torn meniscus. However, there is significant variability in the rate of development of post-meniscectomy osteoarthritis (OA). While there is no current consensus on the risk factors for development of knee OA in patients with meniscus tears, it is likely that both biological and biomechanical factors play critical roles. In this perspective paper, we review the mechanical and the biological predictors of the response of the knee to partial meniscectomy. We review the role of patient-based studies, in vivo animal models, cadaveric models, bioreactor systems, and statistically augmented computational models for the study of meniscus function and post-meniscectomy OA, providing insight into the important interplay between biomechanical and biologic factors. We then discuss the clinical translation of these concepts for ?biologic augmentation? of meniscus healing and meniscus replacement. Ultimately, collaborative studies between engineers, biologists, and clinicians is the optimal way to improve our understanding of meniscus pathology and response to injury and/or disease, and to facilitate effective translation of laboratory findings to improved treatments for our patients. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - SUMMARY Acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage (AUGIH) is a common medical emergency and can present with life threatening haemorrhage. In the UK, there are 70?000 hospital admissions per year. In the majority of cases, the aetiology is non-variceal in origin, but in other cases it is due to variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. It is also a leading indication for transfusion of blood components. This review explores recent randomised data on the efficacy and safety of red blood cell transfusion for AUGIH. In addition, the evidence base for use of other blood components and pro-haemostatic pharmacological agents is discussed, including acid suppression, antifibrinolytics and fibrinogen.

AB  - Primary subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis can rarely be caused by Cladophialophora bantiana. Only two cases have been reported and we present the histologic and culture findings of another. A 32-year-old black female with systemic lupus erythematosus presented with a two-year history of multiple, recurrent, tender, ulcerated skin nodules with purulent drainage involving an area measuring approximately 27.0???15.0?cm on her upper back. She had been involved in a tornado at age 10 and had sustained traumatic implantation of wood splinters in this area. Sections of the excision showed scattered dark pinpoint foci with surrounding suppuration extending to the deep aspect of the specimen. Histology demonstrated features of phaeohyphomycosis ? foci of granulomatous and acute inflammation with central clusters of dematiaceous fungal hyphae within a fibrotic dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Chains of brown-pigmented septate hyphae and unicellular conidia were identified. Culture revealed pigmented septate, branched hyphae and unbranched acropetal chains of conidia with no attachment hila. Dark gray, velvety colonies formed in one week on a potato dextrose agar plate incubated at 25 degrees Celsius. These culture features were characteristic of Cladophialophora bantiana. Despite surgical excision and itraconazole therapy, her skin lesions persisted for the next two years necessitating a re-excision.

AB  - Introduction:? Hemolytic reactions developing during hemodialysis usually are caused by oxidant damage, reduction injury, and osmolar, thermal, and mechanical injury to the red blood cells. Mechanical injury due to maloccluded blood pumps, arterial line collapse, and use of subclavian hemodialysis catheters has been reported. We report one episode of acute hemolysis due to kinked hemodialysis blood lines complicated with pancreatitis. Case Report:?An 18-year-old man with end-stage renal failure of unknown origin had been on hemodialysis since 2002. His past medical history included asthma and hypertension. He was admitted to the hospital because of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting during the dialysis session. Laboratory examination showed hematocrit ?30?%, platelet count of 131,000 per cubic mL, LDH ?5151?U/L, haptoglobin ?0.09?g/L, lipase ?919?U/L, CPK- 260, ASAT ?584?U/L, ALAT- 316?U/L, bilirubin ?36??mol/L, and visible schistocytes on smear. Examination of the abdomen revealed diffuse discomfort and tenderness in epigastrium. The patient was diagnosed as having hemolysis-induced acute pancreatitis. He was treated symptomatically and recovered within a few days. We found the arterial blood line tightly kinked at the dialyser inlet port, and we excluded other reported causes of intravascular hemolysis during hemodialysis. Discussion:?Until a critical pressure is exceeded, despite a kink in the post pump predialyser blood tubing, the blood pump can maintain sufficient blood flow to prevent an increase in the arterial pressure with a triggering of the arterial alarm and a decrease in the venous pressure with a triggering of the venous alarm. Thus, an excessively high pressure can be maintained in this silent segment of the dialyser tubing without activating the pressure alarms, exposing the red blood cells to high sheer stresses and resulting in clinically significant hemolysis. Acute hemolysis can cause a life-threatening acute pancreatitis. The literature indicates that acute pancreatitis is a complication of massive hemolysis with a prevalence of about 20%. The important role of inflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis is well known. Heme released from hemoglobin after episodes of vascular hemolysis has the potential to act as a signalling molecule involved in the triggering of the inflammatory processes associated with massive hemolysis. Hemolysis itself may induce acute pancreatitis by all or some pathways of neutrophil activation and chemoattraction, such as oxidative burst, direct proinflammatory effect, microcirculatory disturbance, and increased expression of proinflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines.

AB  - Summary This chapter addresses strategies for autologous transfusion, various blood-derived biologicals, non-blood-derived drugs and strategies to prevent haemorrhage and manage haemostatic disorders. The criteria for accepting donors for autologous transfusion need not be as strict as those for allogeneic transfusion. Preoperative assessment can identify anemia with correctable cause and contribute to avoidance of allogeneic transfusion. The major cause of anaemia in patients with end-stage renal disease is a lack of production of erythropoietin. The major side-effects of treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) are hypertension and thrombotic episodes, originally thought to be related primarily to excessive doses and too rapid correction of anaemia. Anaphylaxis, the major toxicity associated with vitamin K, is rare, but dramatic. Thrombin is a potent plasma-derived enzyme that is formed from prothrombin as a result of activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways.
