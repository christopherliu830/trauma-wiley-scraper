AB  - Summary The components and reactions of the fibrinolysis system are well understood. The pathway has fewer reactants and interactions than coagulation, but the generation of a complete quantitative model is complicated by the need to work at the solid-liquid interface of fibrin. Diagnostic tools to detect disease states due to malfunctions in the fibrinolysis pathway are also not so well developed as is the case with coagulation. However, there are clearly a number of inherited or acquired pathologies where hyperfibrinolysis is a serious, potentially life-threatening problem and a number of antifibrinolytc drugs are available to treat hyperfibrinolysis. These topics will be covered in the following review.

AB  - Objective? To establish the risk of serious complications from severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia in a region using a common guideline for the management of these conditions. Design? A five-year prospective study. Setting? Sixteen maternity units in Yorkshire. Population? All women managed with severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. Methods? A common guideline was developed for the management of women with these conditions. A network of midwives prospectively collected outcome data. Main outcome measure? Incidence of the conditions and serious complication rates. Results? A total of 210,631 women delivered in the 16 units between 1 January 1999 and 31 December 2003. One thousand eighty-seven women were diagnosed with severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia (5.2/1000). One hundred and fifty-one women had serious complications including 82 women (39/10,000) having eclamptic seizures and 49 women (23/10,000) requiring ICU admission. There were no maternal deaths but 54 out of 1145 babies died before discharge, giving a mortality rate of 47.2/1000. Of the 82 cases of eclampsia, 45 occurred antenatally (55%), 18 before admission to the maternity unit. Eleven cases occurred in labour (13%), including 1 during a caesarean section, and 26 cases occurred following delivery (32%). Twenty-five women developed pulmonary oedema (2.3% of cases) and six women required renal dialysis (0.55% of cases). One hundred and sixty-five (15%) required no antihypertensive therapy and 489 (53%) of the remainder required only oral therapy. Two hundred and one (18.5%) required more than one drug. Conclusion? A regional guideline for severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia can be developed and implemented. Its use may contribute to a low rate of serious complications.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?The autosomally-inherited factor VII (FVII) deficiency and X-linked hemophilia B offer an attractive model to investigate whether reduced levels of FVII and FIX, acting in the initiation and amplification of coagulation respectively, influence hemostasis to a different extent in relation to age and bleeding site. Methods:?Hemophilia B patients (n?=?296) and FVII-deficient males (n?=?109) were compared for FVII/FIX clotting activity, F7/F9 genotypes and clinical phenotypes in a retrospective, multi-centre, cohort study. Results:?Major clinical differences between diseases were observed. Bleeding occurred earlier in hemophilia B (median age 2.0?years, IR 0.9?5.0) than in FVII deficiency (5.2?years, IR 1.9?15.5) and the bleeding-free survival in FVII deficiency was similar to that observed in ?mild? hemophilia B (P?=?0.96). The most frequent disease-presenting symptoms in hemophilia B (hematomas and oral bleeding) differed from those in FVII deficiency (epistaxis and central nervous system bleeding). Differences were confirmed by analysis of FVII-deficient women. Conclusions:?Our data support the notion that low FVII levels sustain hemostasis better than similarly reduced FIX levels. On the other hand, minute amounts of FVII, differently to FIX, are needed to prevent fatal bleeding, as indicated by the rarity of null mutations and the associated life-threatening symptoms in FVII deficiency, which contributes towards shaping clinical differences between diseases in the lowest factor level range. Differences between diseases are only partially explained by mutational patterns and could pertain to the specific roles of FVII and FIX in coagulation phases and to vascular bed-specific components.

AB  - Summary Twentieth century transfusion medicine was advanced by the leadership of many physicians, scientists and technologists and repeatedly incorporated new diagnostics and new therapeutics to improve patient care. Each year, approximately 100 million blood donations are made worldwide. A safe and adequate blood supply is now an essential infrastructure requirement of any modern national healthcare system. During the final two decades of the twentieth century, intense focus on screening blood donations for infectious diseases led to substantial progress in blood safety and a significant reduction in the risk of transfusion-transmitted diseases. With the advent of the twenty-first century, the landscape of transfusion risk shifted its emphasis towards non-infectious hazards. Cellular therapy is a major growth area in transfusion medicine. The ability to mobilise haematopoietic progenitor cells, then harvest them safely in bulk numbers, process, freeze and successfully reinfuse them as a stem cell tissue transplant has completely revolutionised the field of bone marrow transplantation.

AB  - ABSTRACT The Fawn?Hooded rat (FH/Wjd) is an inbred alcohol-preferring rat strain, unlike most of the other strains that were selectively bred for high alcohol intake and preference. It was chosen for study some 16?years ago because of a reported mutation that disrupted platelet serotonin function. Although the FH/Wjd rat has high alcohol intake (>5?g/kg/day) and preference (>65%), interbreeding with an alcohol-non-preferring inbred strain suggested that these measures are unrelated to the serotonin abnormality. Similarly, the exaggerated immobility of the FH/Wjd rats in the forced swim test did not correlate with the high alcohol intake. Many compounds have been tested in the FH/Wjd rats after both acute and chronic treatment and a substantial number of them have proved effective. However, as the case with opiate antagonists, tolerance to the effects of the drug can develop. An up-regulation of opioid receptors accompanied the chronic treatment and this mechanism may account for the development of tolerance. Tolerance to opiate antagonists has also been demonstrated in two of the selectively bred alcohol-preferring rat lines, but it is unknown whether this process may contribute to the relapses seen in individuals being treated with naltrexone. Other drugs that reliably decrease alcohol intake in the FH/Wjd rats include the 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A receptor antagonist, amperozide, the mGlu5 receptor antagonist 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine (MTEP) and herbal derivatives such as ibogaine, St. John?s wort and kudzu extract. Thus, studies in the FH/Wjd rat have led to the discovery of a wide variety of targets for the development of novel agents to treat alcoholism. The fact that several of these drugs were shown to reduce alcohol intake in some of the selectively bred alcohol-preferring rat lines and/or alcohol-preferring vervet monkeys increases our confidence that they are good candidates for further development.

AB  - Summary Kidney-derived c-Kit+ cells exhibit progenitor/stem cell properties in vitro (self-renewal capacity, clonogenicity, and multipotentiality). These cells can regenerate epithelial tubular cells following ischemia-reperfusion injury and accelerate foot processes effacement reversal in a model of acute proteinuria in rats. Several mechanisms are involved in kidney regeneration by kidney-derived c-Kit+ cells, including cell engraftment and differentiation into renal-like structures, such as tubules, vessels, and podocytes. Moreover, paracrine mechanisms could also account for kidney regeneration, either by stimulating proliferation of surviving cells or modulating autophagy and podocyte cytoskeleton rearrangement through mTOR-Raptor and -Rictor signaling, which ultimately lead to morphological and functional improvement. To gain insights into the functional properties of c-Kit+ cells during kidney development, homeostasis, and disease, studies on lineage tracing using transgenic mice will unveil their fate. The results obtained from these studies will set the basis for establishing further investigation on the therapeutic potential of c-Kit+ cells for treatment of kidney disease in preclinical and clinical studies.

AB  - Abstract Oral mucositis (OM) as a complication of high-dose chemotherapy is frequently occurred in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) settings. Erythropoietin (EPO) has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and wound-healing properties and therefore could have an important role in the prevention of OM. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the EPO mouthwash effect on OM incidence and severity in 80 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin disease (HD) or multiple myeloma, undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Patients received either EPO mouthwash (50?IU/ml, 15?ml four times a day) (n?=?40) or placebo (n?=?40) from the starting day of high-dose chemotherapy until day +14 after transplantation or until the day of discharge from the hospital, whichever occurred first. OM was evaluated daily for 21?days after transplantation or until resolution of OM according to World Health Organization oral toxicity scale. The incidence of OM (grades 1?4) in the EPO mouthwash group and control group was significantly different (27.5% vs 77.5%, p?<?0.001). The mean?±?SD of two other parameters of OM including maximum intensity OM score (0.60?±?1.06 vs 1.67?±?1.27) and average intensity OM score (0.47?±?0.80 vs 1.28?±?0.86) was significantly lower in the intervention group (p?<?0.001). Moreover, the mean?±?SD duration of OM was also significantly shorter among the EPO mouthwash recipients (1.92?±?3.42?days vs 5.42?±?3.86?days, P?<?0.001). Also, the duration of neutropenic fever was significantly shorter in the intervention group (2.12?±?2.42?days vs 3.95?±?4.01?days, p?=?0.016). It is concluded that EPO mouthwash can reduce the incidence and duration of OM. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is often considered to be a contraindication to organ donation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of DIC+ donors on kidney recipient (KR) evolution. We identified 169 KRs with DIC+ donation after brain death donors between January 1996 and December 2012 in 6 French transplant centers. Individuals were matched using propensity scores to 338 recipients with DIC? donors according to donor age and sex, whether expanded criteria for the donor existed, graft year, and transplantation center. After kidney transplantation, delayed graft function was observed in 28.1% of DIC+ KRs and in 22.8% of DIC? KRs (NS). Renal allograft survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was 94.5%, 89.3%, and 73.9% and 96.2%, 90.8%, and 81.3% in DIC+ KRs and DIC? KRs, respectively (NS). The median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was similar between DIC+ and DIC? KRs at 3 months, 1 year, and 10 years: 45.9 vs 48.1 mL/min, 42.1 vs 43.1 mL/min, and 33.9 vs 38.1 mL/min, respectively. Delayed calcineurin inhibitor introduction or induction had no impact on delayed graft function rate or eGFR evolution at 10 years after transplantation in DIC+ KRs. Donor DIC did not seem to affect initial outcome, long-term graft function, or allograft survival.

AB  - Abstract The factors that delay wound healing are multiple and relate both to diabetes and to the effect of its complications. Diabetic foot ulcers readily become chronic, and chronic ulcers have biological properties that differ substantially from acute ones. Much of the available information on the biology of wound healing relates to acute and experimental wounds and may not be directly relevant. It follows that there is limited evidence currently available to underpin protocols for the management of diabetic foot ulcers, or to guide choice of applications and dressings 1. Nevertheless, it is possible to define certain principles. Glycaemic control The first relates to glycaemic control. While chronic complications of diabetes such as peripheral vascular disease and neuropathy may be largely irreversible, aspects of structure and function of connective tissue and cells may be impaired by hyperglycaemia, and their function should be improved if normoglycaemia is achieved. Promotion of healing The second principle concerns attempts at active promotion of wound healing by (1) surgical revascularization, and (2) specific attempts to correct defined biological abnormalities thought to be hindering the healing process. These include the use of a variety of applications, dressings and technologies, which may stimulate healing by applying, or stimulating the release of, growth factors and cytokines. While this approach holds the greatest promise for the future, it will be dependent on defining defects which need correction in specific individuals, and having technologies available to address them. This field is in its infancy. Wound care The third broad principle concerns the management of the wound and its surrounding tissue in order to promote healing. This includes regular inspection, cleansing and removal of surface debris, elimination of pathogenic bacteria and creation of an appropriate environment to facilitate endogenous tissue regeneration. There are many applications and dressings that may be chosen to promote healing, but, whichever is selected, wound management has to be integrated into an effective programme of multidisciplinary care.
