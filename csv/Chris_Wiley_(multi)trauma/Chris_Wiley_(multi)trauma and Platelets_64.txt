AB  - Background The outcome of severe acute pancreatitis has scarcely improved in 10 years. Further impact will require new paradigms in pathophysiology and treatment. There is accumulating evidence to support the concept that the intestine has a key role in the pathophysiology of severe acute pancreatitis which goes beyond the notion of secondary pancreatic infection. Intestinal ischaemia and reperfusion and barrier failure are implicated in the development of multiple organ failure. Discussion Conventional management of severe acute pancreatitis has tended to ignore the intestine. More recent attempts to rectify this problem have included 1) resuscitation aimed at restoring intestinal blood flow through the use of appropriate fluids and splanchnic-sparing vasoconstrictors or inotropes; 2) enteral nutrition to help maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier; 3) selective gut decontamination and prophylactic antibiotics to reduce bacterial translocation and secondary infection. Novel therapies are being developed to limit intestinal injury, and these include antioxidants and anti-cytokine agents. This paper focuses on the role of the intestine in the pathogenesis of severe acute pancreatitis and reviews the implications for management.

AB  - Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) was originally developed for the treatment of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A or B and inhibitors. Over the past ten years, it has been successfully used to prevent or control bleeding in several other nonhaemophilic bleeding conditions. Among the newer ?off-label? clinical applications of rFVIIa, there is increasing evidence of its effectiveness in treating obstetric and gynaecological bleeding unresponsive to conventional therapy. The existing literature on the use of rFVIIa in obstetrics and gynaecology is summarised in this review. Although supported by few and uncontrolled studies, on the whole, the published data suggest a potential role of rFVIIa in the management of obstetric and gynaecological intractable bleeding. However, further evidence is needed to improve the assessment of its optimal dose, effectiveness and safety in such conditions.

AB  - Abstract Mammalian epimorphic regeneration is rare and digit tip regeneration in mice is the best-studied model for a multi-tissue regenerative event that involves blastema formation. Digit tip regeneration parallels human fingertip regeneration, thus understanding the details of this response can provide insight into developing strategies to expand the potential of human regeneration. Following amputation, the digit stump undergoes a strong histolytic response involving osteoclast-mediated bone degradation that is spatially and temporally linked to the expansion of blastema osteoprogenitor cells. Blastemal differentiation occurs via direct intramembranous ossification. Although robust, digit regeneration is imperfect: The amputated cortical bone is replaced with woven bone and there is excessive bone regeneration restricted to the dorsal?ventral axis. Ontogenetic and phylogenetic analysis of digit regeneration in amphibians and mammals raise the possibility that mammalian blastema is a product of convergent evolution and we hypothesize that digit tip regeneration evolved from a nonregenerative precondition. A model is proposed in which the mammalian blastema evolved in part from an adaptation of two bone repair strategies (the bone remodeling cycle and fracture healing) both of which are conserved across tetrapod vertebrates. The view that epimorphic regeneration evolved in mammals from a nonregenerative precondition is supported by recent studies demonstrating that complex regenerative responses can be induced from a number of different nonregenerative amputation wounds by specific modification of the healing response.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Major general surgical operations, especially for malignancy, are associated with a high risk of venous thrombo-embolic (VTE) complications, of which about 40 per cent occur after discharge. In this systematic review we examine the value of extended thrombo-prophylaxis. Methods: Three randomized, controlled trials, which studied 1 week versus 4 weeks of thromboprophylaxis (TP) with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), were included in the analysis. We used RevMan (Version 4.1.1, Oxford  P = 0.002). The risk of bleeding was 3.5 per cent in both groups (OR 0.99, 95 per cent CI 0.47?2.06; P = 1). Conclusions: Extended TP results in significant reduction of the risk of developing VTE in patients undergoing major general surgical operations without any increase in the risk of bleeding.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Tissue repair of primary inguinal hernia using mesh relies on scar tissue bonding the mesh to give a sound repair. Collagen has the theoretical advantage of using natural collagen which will be incorporated into the repair and not be a permanent foreign body. Methods: A total of 140 patients were prospectively randomized to receive either polypropylene or collagen mesh. Performance was compared at operation, postoperatively, 3 months, 12 months. Patient's perceptions and quality of life were measured. Patients and researchers were blinded and analysis was undertaken at a separate institution. Results: A total of 78 patients received collagen and 62 received polypropylene mesh, with no difference in handling, insertion and suturing at operation. Postoperatively there was an increase in haematoma in the polypropylene group (P = 0.048). Infection and inflammation were similar postoperatively and at 3 months. There was one recurrent hernia in each group at 1 year. Activity and pain scores postoperatively were similar and were normal by 4 weeks. Quality of life was reduced in both groups at 4 weeks: Euroqol P = 0.002, SF 36: physical function P = 0.016, social function P = 0.003. At 3 months there was reduced physical function in the polypropylene group (P = 0.037). Conclusions: Initial results showed that collagen mesh is an effective method of providing tissue repair in primary inguinal hernia. The collagen mesh produced fewer haematomas postoperatively and patients recovered physical activity more quickly. Otherwise it produced results comparable to polypropylene without the risks of a permanently implanted foreign body. It is proposed to recruit 200 patients to the study and undertake follow-up for 2 years postoperatively.

AB  - Abstract Aims: A radical shift in management of abdominal sepsis from surgery to radiological drainage occurred in 20 years. This is safe and in majority it avoids the need for conventional surgery. When surgery is indicated it provides the roadmap by showing the exact nature of the abscess and its contents. This is a retrospective study from single centre to look at the outcome of management of localized intra-abdominal sepsis by using radiological guided drainage. Methods: All the patients who underwent radiological intervention for abdominal sepsis between 1995 and 2001 were included in the study. These were scanned and drains were inserted under radiological guidance under local anaesthetic. All these patients were followed up with antibiotics and drainograms when appropriate. Results: These patients were between ages of 14 and 84 years. A total of 216 procedures were performed. Twenty-four of them were diagnostic in that the patients were subjected to laparotomy or conservative management. A total of 192 patients had therapeutic aspiration or drainage. One hundred and forty-five patients had catheters inserted for continuous drainage and the rest had therapeutic aspiration. These patients included pelvic abscess (15 per cent), perinephric collections (12.4 per cent), subdiaphragmatic abscess (12 per cent), liver abscesses (8 per cent), pseudocysts (7 per cent), pericolic abscess (7.5 per cent), sub-hepatic abscess (5 per cent), psoas abscess (3.4 per cent), appendicular abscess (3.4 per cent), empyema gall bladder and pancreatic abscesses. Complications were minimal including transient sepsis, residual collection, haemorrhage into the cavity and persistent sinus. Our results include bacteriological studies of aspirates, which will be presented in detail at the time of presentation. Conclusion: Percutaneuos guided aspiration and drainage is a safe and effective alternative to conventional open surgical drainage. We recommend this as the first line of management.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Hyperhidrosis substantially impairs quality of life. Sympathectomy is often ineffective for axillary hyperhidrosis and carries a significant risk of compensatory hyperhidrosis. Botulinum toxin injection offers a temporary but effective treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the value to patients of this treatment as judged by their voluntary, self-initiated re-attendance for further treatment. Methods: A prospective database of all patients attending for Botulinum toxin injections for hyperhidrosis has been kept since October 1997. After treatment no routine review is arranged. Patients who want further injections must self refer to the clinic when they think it is necessary. Results: From October 1997 to January 2002 60 patients have received Botulinum toxin for hyperhidrosis (54 axillary, 6 plantar). 45 received their first injections more than 12 months ago and of these 31 (69 per cent) have initiated re-attendance for further treatment at a median of 10 months (IQR 7?13 months) after initial treatment. Conclusions: Botulinum toxin injection for hyperhidrosis is of sufficient value to at least 69 per cent of patients that they self-initiate repeated therapy. The median duration of efficacy is 10 months.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the current scientific literature on ischemia?reperfusion (IR) injury in both human and veterinary medicine. To describe the normal antioxidant defense mechanisms, the pathophysiology of IR injury, and the role of neutrophils in IR injury. Data sources: Data sources include scientific reviews and original research publications in both human and veterinary medicine. Summary: IR injury is a complex pathophysiological process involving numerous pathways and body systems. Normal antioxidant defense mechanisms function to limit oxidative injury during times of health. Ischemia is the period that occurs before oxygenated blood is re-introduced and the severity of injury has been shown to correlate with the magnitude and length of ischemia in dogs. During ischemia, there is a buildup of substances (i.e., xanthine oxidase, hypoxanthine, etc.) that, upon re-introduction of oxygen, form reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS, produced in large part upon reperfusion, can cause extensive damage to DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Although mammalian systems are endowed with abundant antioxidant defenses, the generation of large amounts of ROS can overwhelm these mechanisms leading to cell dysfunction and death. Neutrophils play a critical role in IR injury and may mediate the majority of mucosal and microvascular injury that occurs by releasing ROS and proteolytic enzymes. Although experimental studies have been carried out on cats, dogs, and horses there are few clinical studies on companion animals. Conclusions: The pathophysiology of IR injury is complex and involves damage by ROS to all biological membranes. Neutrophils play a major role in IR injury and initiate and propogate much of the damage. This article is intended as a review of the pathophysiology of IR injury.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Low-intensity extracorporeal shock wave therapy (LI-ESWT) to the penis has recently emerged as a new and promising modality in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). Aim To review the published literature on the mechanism of action of LI-ESWT; and to report our clinical data on its efficacy in men with vasculogenic ED. Methods A Medline search using the relevant keywords on this topic has been done. Results From the results of numerous preclinical and animal studies that have been done to date, sufficient evidence shows that the underlying mechanism of action of LI-ESWT is probably neovascularization. Therefore, local application of LI-ESWT to the corpora cavernosa may potentially act in the same mechanism and increase corporal blood flow. We found that the application of LI-ESWT to patients who responded to oral therapy (PDE5i) eliminated their dependence on PDE5i and they were able to successfully achieve erections and vaginal penetration (60-75%). Furthermore, PDE5i non-responders became responders and capable of vaginal penetration (72%). Additionally, LI-ESWT resulted in long-term improvement of the erectile mechanism. Conclusions LI-ESWT has the potential to improve and permanently restore erectile function by reinstating the penile blood flow. Although these results on LI-ESWT are promising, further multi- centered studies with longer follow-up are needed to confirm these findings. Gruenwald I, Kitrey ND, Appel B, and Vardi Y.

AB  - Summary Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a serious and potentially fatal complication of transfusion of blood and blood components. TRALI is under-diagnosed and under-reported because of a lack of awareness. A number of models have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of TRALI: an antibody mediated model; a two-event biologically active mediator model; and a combined model. TRALI can occur with any type of blood product and can occur with as little as one unit. Its presentation is similar to other forms of acute lung injury and management is predominantly supportive. The main strategy in combating TRALI is prevention both through manipulation of the donor pool and through clinical strategies directed at reducing transfusion of blood products including, but not limited to, evidence-based lower transfusion thresholds. This article presents a review of TRALI and addresses the definition, pathology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, treatment and prevention of the syndrome.

AB  - Abstract Aims: We studied the effect of binge drinking on surgical dexterity immediately after and the morning after alcohol intake. Methods: Five surgeons (all males, age 31?42 years) were trained on laparoscopic surgical simulator (MIST-VR) to reach a desired standard of performance. Three sets of experiments were a control with no alcohol and full night's sleep, a sham night out (sleep deprived) without alcohol and a night out with alcohol ad libitum. Parameters recorded were average time taken to perform task, error rate, average diathermy time and diathermy (damage) time to main object. Comparisons between baseline readings, those in the middle of night and those of following morning were made with Wilcoxon signed ranks test (all two tailed, significance at P < 0.01). Results: The candidates consumed on an average 10.33 (range 6?15) units of alcohol and had 0.86 per cent (range 0.71?1.1 per cent) of breath alcohol levels and had an average of 3.75 (range 3?5 h) hours of sleep after a typical night out. The morning-after breath alcohol levels were 0 per cent. There was significant deterioration in the performance indicators in all the parameters immediately after alcohol consumption. The time taken to complete task and the time when the diathermy was used were still significantly worse the morning after the typical night out. The sham night out showed deterioration only on time parameters with control night out showed no changes. Conclusions: A typical night out deteriorates performance on a surgical simulator, which persists till the following morning as compared to just a ?nonalcoholic? night out.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Laparoscopic appendicectomy is a safe and effective procedure but concerns have been raised that the operation has taken appendicectomy away from the basic surgical trainee (BST) and into the hands of more senior surgeons (HST). We assessed the impact of laparoscopic appendicectomy as a trainee operation. Methods: This was a prospective audit of 185 consecutive patients with a clinical suspicion of appendicitis who were referred to a major teaching hospital over a 7-month period. Outcome measures included operative time, conversion from laparoscopic to open, complications, and length of stay. Results: Of the 120 patients who underwent surgical intervention by trainees, six had formal laparotomies, 40 patients successfully had a laparoscopic appendectomy, nine were converted (18.3 per cent), 24 patients had a diagnostic laparoscopy and 41 underwent open appendectomy. The performance of BSTs and HSTs is shown below. No significant difference was found in operative time for laparoscopic appendicectomy between trainees (BST median 65 min, HST median 60 min). The duration of laparoscopic appendectomy was significantly longer (median 60 min versus 40 min for open (P < 0.0001)). Length of stay was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group compared to open (49 h versus 72 h (P < 0.01)). There was no difference between the two groups of trainees. The complication rate was lower in the laparoscopic appendectomy group. Conclusion: In our experience laparoscopic appendectomy may fulfil a role in the training of laparoscopy that open appendectomy has traditionally provided for laparotomy.

AB  - Abstract Aims: The high morbidity (28.5 per cent readmission rate) experienced whilst waiting for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) after an index admission with acute cholecystitis (AC) has been reported. Since this report a provision for emergency LC service has been made available in the same DGH. This study performed over a 12-month period (October 2000?September 2001) reports the impact of those changes on the management of AC and allows comparisons between these results and those achieved in the previous study (the control period). Methods: During the study 146 patients presented as emergency with AC. Emergency cholecytectomy was performed in 75 and the rest were waitlisted. GI surgeons performed 76 per cent of the LC whilst the non-GI surgeons listed the majority of their cases for delayed LC. Seventy-one per cent of the LC was done laparoscopically with an 18.8 per cent conversion rate; 59 per cent (44/75) cholecystectomies were performed by trainees under supervision. The number of emergency LC, conversion rates, complications, median length of total (TLOS) and postop hospital stay (PLOS) were used as end points. Results: There was a seven-fold (Table) increase in the number of cholecystectomies during their index admission in the study group. Major complications and conversion rates of LC performed in the study period (5.3 and 18 per cent) were similar to those of delayed LC in the control period (6.2 and 12 per cent). Although the TLOS was less in the study group compared to the control (table), patients with AC still had a median wait of 5 days between their admission and their cholecystectomy. Conclusions: These results document that emergency cholecystectomy service can be provided with minimal complications and a shorter hospital stay. Further improvements to reduce inhospital stay require prompt ultrasound examination and rostering of laparoscopically competent surgeons.

AB  - Summary. It is well established that debris tends to accumulate in banked blood, the amount of debris increasing with storage time. If such a blood is transfused to a patient, it will be filtered by the capillary network of the lungs and could cause various intensities of microemboli. These can be prevented by microfiltration?the Swank IL200 transfusion filter made of Dacron wool is perfectly suitable. It removes more than 70% of the debris 29-100 ?m size from four blood units and its efficiency for particle removal is greatly increased by lactate priming.
