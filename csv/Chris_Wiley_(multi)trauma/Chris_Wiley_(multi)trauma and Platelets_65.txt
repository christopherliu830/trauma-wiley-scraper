AB  - Abstract Background: Robotic-enhanced surgery has emerged as a solution to some of the drawbacks of traditional minimal access surgery. Master?slave telemanipulator systems have been extensively used in surgical interventions, but the learning curve in this technology has not been objectively assessed. Aims: Delineate the learning curve of surgeons for a robotic task in a complex bench model. Find if there is a quantifiable learning process in a short period of exposure to the Da Vinci system. Methods: Nine surgeons completed five synthetic small bowel anastomoses (Limbs and things, UK) using the Da Vinci robotic system (Intuitive Surgical, CA) in standardized conditions. All procedures were digitized and quality scored independently by three surgeons employing the objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS). Wilcoxon signed ranks tests were used to compare the first and last attempts. A P-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Cronbach's-alpha was used to measure interrater reliability. Results: A learning curve was constructed using time and OSATS score of every task. Both variables showed a rapid and progressive learning process. Mean times for the first and last attempt were 3507 s and 2287 s (P < 0.008) and mean OSATS scores were 17 and 24 (P < 0.012), respectively. A high interobserver reliability was found (α = 0.894). Conclusions: This study clearly shows a significant reduction in the time taken (34 per cent) and improvement in quality (29 per cent) between the first and fifth attempt in a bench model. Therefore, we conclude that Da Vinci system allows fast adaptation and short learning process regardless previous surgical experience.

AB  - Abstract Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) play a crucial role in the generation of the body's blood and immune cells. This process takes place primarily in the bone marrow in specialized 'niche' microenvironments, which provide signals responsible for maintaining a balance between HSC quiescence, self-renewal, and lineage specification required for life-long hematopoiesis. While our understanding of these signaling mechanisms continues to improve, our ability to engineer them in vitro for the expansion of clinically relevant HSC populations is still lacking. In this review, we focus on development of biomaterials-based culture platforms for in vitro study of interactions between HSCs and their local microenvironment. The tools and techniques used for both examining HSC-niche interactions as well as applying these findings towards controlled HSC expansion or directed differentiation in 2D and 3D platforms are discussed. These novel techniques hold the potential to push the existing boundaries of HSC cultures towards high-throughput, real-time, and single-cell level biomimetic approaches that enable a more nuanced understanding of HSC regulation and function. Their application in conjunction with innovative biomaterial platforms can pave the way for engineering artificial bone marrow niches for clinical applications as well as elucidating the pathology of blood-related cancers and disorders.

AB  - Summary The vascular endothelial surface is coated by the glycocalyx, a ubiquitous gel-like layer composed of a membrane-binding domain that contains proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycan side-chains, and plasma proteins such as albumin and antithrombin. The endothelial glycocalyx plays a critical role in maintaining vascular homeostasis. However, this component is highly vulnerable to damage and is also difficult to examine. Recent advances in analytical techniques have enabled biochemical, visual and computational investigation of this vascular component. The glycocalyx modulates leukocyte?endothelial interactions, thrombus formation and other processes that lead to microcirculatory dysfunction and critical organ injury in sepsis. It also acts as a regulator of vascular permeability and contains mechanosensors as well as receptors for growth factors and anticoagulants. During the initial onset of sepsis, the glycocalyx is damaged and circulating levels of glycocalyx components, including syndecans, heparan sulfate and hyaluronic acid, can be measured and are reportedly useful as biomarkers for sepsis. Also, a new methodology using side-stream dark-field imaging is now clinically available for assessing the glycocalyx. Multiple factors including hypervolemia and hyperglycemia are toxic to the glycocalyx, and several agents have been proposed as therapeutic modalities, although no single treatment has been proven to be clinically effective. In this article, we review the derangement of the glycocalyx in sepsis. Despite the accumulated knowledge regarding the important roles of the glycocalyx, the relationship between derangement of the endothelial glycocalyx and severity of sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulation has not been adequately elucidated and further work is needed.
