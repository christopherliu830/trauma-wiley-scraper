AB  - Summary Reperfusion therapy for treatment of acute ischemic stroke is aimed at restoring blood flow to an infarcting area of the brain. The goal of this therapy is to minimize ischemic damage and thus maximize physical and functional outcome from ischemic stroke. Currently available reperfusion therapies are intravenous administration of rt-PA, intra-arterial thrombolysis, and mechanical embolectomy. In this chapter, inclusion and exclusion criteria, outcome data, and potential risks associated with these therapies are discussed. Key studies that have evaluated these therapies are also discussed. An algorithm outlining decision making with respect to therapy selection is incorporated into the chapter.

AB  - Summary Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease, caused by deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, required for the degradation of glycosphingolipids. Clinical manifestations include hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, bone disease and a bleeding diathesis, frequently resulting in presentation to haematologists. Historically managed by splenectomy, transfusions and orthopaedic surgery, the development of specific therapy in the form of intravenous enzyme replacement therapy in the 1990s has resulted in dramatic improvements in haematological and visceral disease. Recognition of complications, including multiple myeloma and Parkinson disease, has challenged the traditional macrophage-centric view of the pathophysiology of this disorder. The pathways by which enzyme deficiency results in the clinical manifestations of this disorder are poorly understood; altered inflammatory cytokine profiles, bioactive sphingolipid derivatives and alterations in the bone marrow microenvironment have been implicated. Further elucidating these pathways will serve to advance our understanding not only of GD, but of associated disorders.

AB  - Objective Current haematology reference intervals (RIs) for koalas were developed in northern Australian koalas, using low numbers and/or individuals of unknown Chlamydia pecorum and koala retrovirus (KoRV) status. This study developed haematological RIs for wild, clinically healthy southern Australian koalas of known C. pecorum and KoRV infection status and investigated the effects of population, age and sex. Methods Haematological RIs were determined for 138 clinically healthy South Australian koalas (Mount Lofty Ranges [MLR], n = 68; Kangaroo Island, n = 70) examined in April 2016 and February 2017, respectively. C. pecorum and KoRV status were determined by PCR. Results RIs for southern koala haematological parameters were established for all koalas based on the finding that there were limited differences in haematological values in koalas with subclinical C. pecorum or KoRV infections (P?>?0.05), except KoRV-infected koalas had a lower haematocrit than noninfected koalas. MLR koalas had significantly lower erythrocyte mass and leucocyte counts than Kangaroo Island koalas. Young koalas had significantly lower haemoglobin, haematocrit and higher mean cellular haemoglobin concentration and lymphocyte counts than adult koalas. MLR male koalas had elevated erythrocyte, leucocyte and neutrophil counts compared with MLR females. Conclusion The haematological RIs developed in this study are based on a large number of clinically healthy koalas, where subclinical C. pecorum and KoRV infections had no effect on haematological values and will be a valuable tool during clinical examination and disease investigation by veterinarians and researchers Australia-wide.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2011) 119, 868?878. Abstract Traumatic injury to the CNS results in increased expression and deposition of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) that are inhibitory to axonal regeneration. Transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?) has been implicated as a major mediator of these changes, but the mechanisms through which TGF-? regulates CSPG expression are not known. Using lentiviral expressed Smad-specific ShRNA we show that TGF-? induction of CSPG expression in astrocytes is Smad-dependent. However, we find a differential dependence of the synthetic machinery on Smad2 and/or Smad3. TGF-? induction of neurocan and xylosyl transferase 1 required both Smad2 and Smad3, whereas induction of phosphacan and chondroitin synthase 1 required Smad2 but not Smad3. Smad3 knockdown selectively reduced induction of chondroitin-4-sulfotransferase 1 and the amount of 4-sulfated CSPGs secreted by astrocytes. Additionally, Smad3 knockdown in astrocytes was more efficacious in promoting neurite outgrowth of neurons cultured on the TGF-?-treated astrocytes. Our data implicate TGF-? Smad3-mediated induction of 4-sulfation as a critical determinant of the permissiveness of astrocyte secreted CSPGs for axonal growth.

AB  - Objective To estimate incidence, trends over time, and risk factors for massive blood transfusions in obstetric patients. A secondary aim was to evaluate transfusion ratios in relation to massive transfusion. Design Population-based cohort. Setting Five hospitals, in the Stockholm County, Sweden, from 1990 to 2011. Population All women that gave birth in Stockholm county, Sweden, and who received blood transfusions postpartum between 1990 and 2011. Methods Data on pregnancies and deliveries from the Swedish National Medical Birth Registry was cross-linked to the Stockholm transfusion database. Massive blood transfusion was defined as the transfusion of ≥10 units of red blood cells from partus through the next day. Main outcome measures Main primary outcome was massive blood transfusion postpartum. Results Our cohort comprised 517 874 deliveries. Massive blood transfusion occurred in 277 women, for an incidence of 5.3 per 10 000 deliveries, and increased by 30% (P < 0.001) between the first and the second half of the study period. Major risk factors apparent before delivery were abnormal placentation (odds ratio [OR] 41; 95% CI 29.3?58.1), pre-eclampsia/placental abruption (OR 4; 95% CI 2.8?5.6), and previous caesarean delivery (OR 4; 95% CI 3.1?6.0). Risk factors at time of delivery were uterine rupture, atonic uterus, and caesarean delivery (OR 38, 17, and 3, respectively). Conclusion We found an increasing trend in the postpartum rate of massive transfusion. Women with abnormal placentation were found to have the highest increased risk. Improved antenatal awareness of these women at risk might improve management and reduce the rate of massive transfusion. Tweetable abstract Risk of massive blood transfusion in obstetric patients increases with placental complications and prior caesarean section.
