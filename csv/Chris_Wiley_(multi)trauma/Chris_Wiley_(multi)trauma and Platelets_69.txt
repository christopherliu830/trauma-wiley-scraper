AB  - Summary The first meeting of international specialists in the field of von Willebrand disease (VWD) was held in the Åland islands in 1998 where Erik von Willebrand had first observed a bleeding disorder in some members of a family from Föglö and a summary of the meeting was published in 1999. The second meeting was held in 2010 and a report of the meeting was published in 2012. Topics covered included progress in understanding of VWD over the last 50 years; multimers; classification of VWD; pharmacokinetics and laboratory assays; genetics; treating the paediatric patient; prophylaxis; geriatrics; gene therapy and treatment guidelines. This third meeting held over 3 days covered the structure and function of von Willebrand factor (VWF); type 1 VWD, the most common form of the disease; a lifespan of pharmacokinetics in VWD; detecting inhibitors in VWD patients; and special challenges in understanding and treating the female VWD patient.

AB  - Summary This chapter covers all aspects of laboratory medicine including collection, handling, storage, and transport of specimens, as well as procedures and normal ranges. It gives information to understand and perform laboratory medicine. Blood chemistry tests are extremely useful diagnostic tools in veterinary medicine. They are used to evaluate various blood substances to help portray certain body and organ functions. Although many hospitals prefer to send out samples to reference laboratories for evaluation, the knowledge of how to perform a manual complete blood count can be very useful in certain situations, for example, when time is crucial during emergencies, when an automated machine is not functioning properly, or when an automated machine is not at hand. Having rapid results can give the veterinarian insight into the patient's hematologic status or provide information on certain types of anemia, organ functions, and neoplasia. The chapter describes the handling and collection techniques needed to obtain a proper microbial sample.

AB  - Aim? The aim of the study is to quantitate D antigenic sites on RBC in weak D and partial D variants in Indian population by flowcytometric method. Method? Dantigenic sites were estimated in 48 cases of partial D, eight cases of weak D (identified by serological methods) and normal Rh phenotypes subjects by flowcytometric technique. The indirect immunoflourescence method was employed using thirty epitope specific monoclonal anti-D as primary antibody. The D antigenic sites were calculated using standard RBC with known D antigenic sites. Result? The mean (±I S.D) D antigenic sites per RBC in weak D and partial D were 4503?±?2067 and 6750?±?3426 respectively. In R1R1 phenotype the range of D antigenic sites was 16500?±?2500 and in R1r it was 10600?±?2520. In four cases of weak D sites were in range of 1700 to 3500 and in other four it was 5000 to 7200?D sites/RBC. Among partial D variants DVI had minimum, and DVa had maximum number of D sites. Conclusion? Flowcytometry is a very good tool for demonstrating minor differences in D antigen sites in partial D and weak D when serological methods are not conclusive.

AB  - BloodSafe is a joint initiative between the South Australian (SA) Department of Health, Australian Red Cross Blood Service, hospitals and transfusion service providers. It has successfully established quality assurance programs to improve the safety and quality of blood management practice within the SA health system. BloodSafe began as a project in September of 2002 initially with 12?months funding from the Safety and Quality Council. Four Transfusion Nurse Consultants were appointed across five major metropolitan teaching hospitals. Audit of practice within these hospitals demonstrated three major problem areas- transfusion specimen collection, the decision to transfuse and administration of blood. A further 12?months funding was granted including extension of the project to include a Nurse Educator for the state to introduce initiatives into country and private hospitals. Reaudit of practice after interventions and education demonstrated that the Transfusion Nurse Consultants were effective change agents. In particular red cell use outside the NHMRC/ASBT guidelines fell from 18% to 4%(p?<?0.01) in stable adult orthopaedic patients audited. A number of other important aspects of transfusion practice also showed significant improvement including documentation, consent and administration. Recurrent funding for BloodSafe Transfusion Nurse Consultants was granted by the SA Department of Health from July 2004. Factors contributing to the success of BloodSafe include a multidisciplinary team, Transfusion Nurses of clinical nurse consultant level, demonstration of a clear need for the initiatives, evidence of successful practice improvement, statewide collaboration and interventions, benchmarking across hospitals, and impartiality of the BloodSafe name with acceptance by stakeholders.

AB  - Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion has been implicated in certain adverse patient outcomes. Immunomodulation may play a central role. The aim of this project was to determine the ability of supernatants and cellular fractions of RBC concentrates to modulate the immune response of allogeneic mononuclear cells (MNCs), particularly monocytes. Non-leucocytereduced, buffy-coat-depleted and leucocyte-filtered RBC concentrates were prepared and stored according to standard blood bank procedures. RBC samples were collected on day 1 and fortnightly until product expiry, and centrifuged to obtain supernatant and cellular fractions. On the?day of RBC sample collection, whole blood (WB) and MNCs were prepared from ABO-compatible allogeneic donors. Induction of monocyte CD11b and CD54 was determined by flow cytometry by incubating allogeneic WB with RBC supernatants or cellular fractions, followed by staining with fl uorescently-labelled anti-CD14, anti-CD11b and anti-CD54. Cytokine release was determined by incubating MNCs with RBC supernatants and culture supernatants were assessed by ELISA for IL-8, TNFalpha; and IL-10. Supernatant and cellular fraction from non-leucocyte-reduced RBC concentrates induced expression of CD11b and CD54 on allogeneic monocytes. Buffy-coatdepleted and leucocyte-filtered RBC concentrates had minimal effect on monocyte CD11b or CD54 expression. Cytokine release from MNCs incubated with RBC supernatant suggested a tenuous balance between proinflammatory (IL-8 and TNF alpha;) and immunosuppressive (IL-10) responses. All RBC product types induced cytokine release from MNCs. The results from this study indicate that stored RBC concentrates can modulate allogeneic MNCs. Both proinflammatory and immunosuppressive responses were evident. Leucocytes in RBC concentrates appear to favour a proinflammatory response by MNCs.

AB  - Abstract Wound healing is an inherent response resulting in the restoration of tissue integrity. It is a complex process involving cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and the synthesis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The dermal tissue is an important component of skin that acts as a connecting link between the epidermis and hypodermis. The appearance of scars and contractures after autologous split-thickness skin transplantation or single epidermis diaphragm transplantation for full skin defects indicates that the dermal tissue plays an important role in skin regeneration. Theoretically, dermis cannot regenerate like the liver, bone and epidermis after being destroyed by burns or avulsion. Scarring is hard to avoid during the process of natural healing. However, if the dermis could be reconstructed perfectly, this would be a breakthrough in the methods used for wound healing. In this review, we summarize recent research about dermal regeneration and discuss the probability of advances in the field. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary General recommendations for plasma transfusion have been well described in many guidelines. Therapeutic uses of plasma, in association with bleeding and abnormalities of coagulation tests (except in emergencies) are based on pathophysiological rationale, but questions about optimal dose and schedule of plasma. A recurring theme in many settings is an overall paucity of high-level evidence to inform optimal plasma transfusion practice remain unanswered, and this particularly applies to prophylactic uses of plasma. There should be more recognition of the limitations of current standard coagulation screening tests, and appreciation that in vitro abnormalities of coagulation screening tests do not equate with an in vivo failure of clinical haemostasis and the presence of clinical coagulopathy. Newer global tests of haemostasis may be better markers of abnormal bleeding risk, but should be assessed and validated in larger clinical studies. Given current evidence, a more appropriate plasma transfusion strategy may be one that emphasises the therapeutic use of plasma in bleeding patients. The role, if any, of prophylactic plasma transfusion in non-bleeding patients with abnormalities of standard coagulation tests, which have limited value in predicting bleeding remains very uncertain. Future research should identify the constituents in plasma that are providing the most benefit (e.g. by analogy the role of ADAMTS13 in TTP). With a better mechanistic understanding of disorders with acquired deficiencies of one or more coagulation factors, replacement might also be more appropriately managed in the future with concentrates of multiple coagulation factors, and which would minimise risks of circulatory overload described when high volume plasma transfusions are given.

AB  - Born at the dawn of the 20th Century, Transfusion Medicine has seen tremendous progress and technical achievement during the last 100?years. As the pace of change increases, the prospects for the future are even brighter. This lecture will review the recent past developments and provide conjecture on future advances in each of the following areas: blood donor services, infectious hazards, non-infectious hazards, process risk, diagnostics and therapeutics. Expectations of what may occur by 2010 and 2015 will be presented. Emerging technologies such as gene array and radio-frequency identification are likely to produce advances in the safety of blood transfusion therapy. More into the future, nanotechnology may re-invent the indications for blood therapies. The field of new therapeutics should be the fastest growing area and the lecture will highlight recent advances in drug development and molecular therapeutics as well as highlight coming technology such as robotic surgery. The therapeutic promise offered by nuclear transfer technology and its impact on cellular therapies will be addressed. With these new opportunities come new challenges and the lecture concludes with an impassioned reminder of the real challenges that await us.

AB  - Australian Rh(D) Immunoglobulin is produced by CSL Bioplasma using plasma containing anti-D collected by the Australian Red Cross Blood Service (ARCBS) from Australian voluntary blood donors. The ARCBS Rh Project was established, initially in New South Wales in 1967, with an aim of providing an adequate supply of Australian derived Rh(D) Immunoglobulin. In 1999, the NHMRC ?Guidelines on the prophylactic use of Rh(D) Immunoglobulin (Anti-D) in obstetrics? stated that universal prophylaxis with Rh(D) Immunoglobulin to RhD negative women with no preformed anti-D antibodies at 28 and 34 weeks gestation is generally regarded as best practice. With the availablity of Rh(D) Immunoglobulin at that time, the NHMRC recommended a phased implementation commencing with all Rh(D) negative primigravidae with no preformed anti-D antibodies (Phase 1). Phase 1 commenced in late 2002. The NHMRC recommemnded that full antenatal prophylaxis (phase 2) would be implemented when domestic supplies of Rh(D) Immunoglobulin increased sufficiently to cover the increased demand. The ARCBS plays an integral part in the implementation of universal antenatal prophylaxis by being the supplier of plasma containing anti-D for production and as the distributor of the final Rh(D) Immunoglobulin product. In 1999, the ARCBS supplied an average of 15???106?IU of anti-D per month to CSL Bioplasma. Implementation of phase 1 occurred following the introduction of two new products; the Australian derived Rh(D) Immunoglobulin 250?IU dose for first trimester indications and the temporary importation of WinRho SDFTM for postnatal use. Implementation of phase 2 and 3 requires the ARCBS to increase the amount of anti-D collected to an average of 30???106?IU and 45???106?IU per month, respectively. Phase 3 of the program is full antenatal prophylaxis supported entirely by domestic product. In 2002, additional funding was allocated to the ARCBS Rh Project to implement strategies to ensure that the input targets for phase 2 and 3 are achieved. In mid 2004, following months of primary immunisation and boosting of both new and existing donors, input levels began to consistently meet or exceed 30???106?IU, and planning for phase 2, implementation began. This presentation will give an overview of the strategies used by the ARCBS to increase the volume of anti-D collected from these donors.

AB  - In 1966, Sydney hosted the conference of the International Society of Blood Transfusion. At an Rh Symposium, experts revealed that several countries had conducted trials proving the safety and efficiency of anti-D in preventing Rh Haemolytic Disease of the Newborn. There have been no other major advances in the prevention of this tragic disease since that time. The source of anti-D in Australia is donated by a small group of Rh Project donors, and we depend entirely on them for the precious antibody which prevents Rh Disease. They have given magnificent service and thousands of babies have been saved. The Rh Project donors? contribution over 37?years is remarkable, inspiring and a triumph over disease.

AB  - As a cosmic element Oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe. Its presence in the atmosphere and solubility in water makes life on Earth possible. As a human element Oxygen makes up approximately 60% of our body weight and access to too little or too much is fatal. Medically, Oxygen is an essential therapeutic element and its technical delivery has led to the development of blood transfusion, ventilators and intensive care units. The discovery and evolution of our understanding of Oxygen as ?The Molecule that made the World? is a story of genius, serendipity and politics. To the haematologist and transfusionist Oxygen?s relationship to the red cell and the haemoglobin molecule is a constant source of amazement and fascination. The red cell, the only cell in the body that is not dependent on Oxygen for energy production, has, in conjunction with the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, the awesome responsibility of delivery adequate amounts of Oxygen to every cell in the body 24 hours a day 7?days a week. Haemoglobin, probably the most studied molecular in biology, has been pivotal in the broader understanding of molecular structure and function and continues to reveal it?s secrets. Oxygen, as an economic element is essential to industry and as an environmental element is closely linked to conservation of planet Earth. Many sports have a close and frequently dubious interest in enhancing delivery of oxygen to the muscles. On the basis of doubtful people who feel the need are increasingly being enticed to ?Flood their bodies with Oxygen as therapy against our polluted World?. It is the presenter?s aim that this lecture will illustrate the paramount role of Oxygen to our existence and it?s central importance in the history of medicine, and blood transfusion in particular.
