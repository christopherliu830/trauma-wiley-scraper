AB  - Abstract Background This single-centre study evaluated the outcome of a pancreatoduodenectomy for Grade 5 injuries of the pancreas and duodenum. Methods Prospectively recorded data of patients who underwent a pancreatoduodenectomy for trauma at a Level I Trauma Centre during a 22-year period were analysed. Results Nineteen (17 men and 2 women, median age 28 years, range 14?53 years) out of 426 patients with pancreatic injuries underwent a pancreatoduodenectomy (gunshot n = 12, blunt trauma n = 6 and stab wound n = 1). Nine patients had associated inferior vena cava (IVC) or portal vein (PV) injuries. Five patients had initial damage control procedures and underwent a definitive operation at a median of 15?h (range 11?92) later. Twelve had a pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PPPD) and 7 a standard Whipple. Three patients with APACHE II scores of 15, 18, 18 died post-operatively of multi-organ failure. All 16 survivors had Dindo-Clavien grade I (n = 1), grade II (n = 7), grade IIIa (n = 2), grade IVa (n = 6) post-operative complications. Factors complicating surgery were shock on admission, number of associated injuries, coagulopathy, hypothermia, gross bowel oedema and traumatic pancreatitis. Conclusions A pancreatoduodenectomy is a life-saving procedure in a small cohort of stable patients with non-reconstructable pancreatic head injuries. Damage control before a pancreatoduodenectomy will salvage a proportion of the most severely injured patients who have multiple injuries.

AB  - Summary Innate immunity is fundamental to our defense against microorganisms. Physiologically, the intravascular innate immune system acts as a purging system that identifies and removes foreign substances leading to thromboinflammatory responses, tissue remodeling, and repair. It is also a key contributor to the adverse effects observed in many diseases and therapies involving biomaterials and therapeutic cells/organs. The intravascular innate immune system consists of the cascade systems of the blood (the complement, contact, coagulation, and fibrinolytic systems), the blood cells (polymorphonuclear cells, monocytes, platelets), and the endothelial cell lining of the vessels. Activation of the intravascular innate immune system in vivo leads to thromboinflammation that can be activated by several of the system's pathways and that initiates repair after tissue damage and leads to adverse reactions in several disorders and treatment modalities. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge in the field and discuss the obstacles that exist in order to study the cross-talk between the components of the intravascular innate immune system. These include the use of purified in vitro systems, animal models and various types of anticoagulants. In order to avoid some of these obstacles we have developed specialized human whole blood models that allow investigation of the cross-talk between the various cascade systems and the blood cells. We in particular stress that platelets are involved in these interactions and that the lectin pathway of the complement system is an emerging part of innate immunity that interacts with the contact/coagulation system. Understanding the resulting thromboinflammation will allow development of new therapeutic modalities.

AB  - Purpose Typically, apolipoproteins are individually measured in blood by immunoassay. In this report, we describe the development of a multiplexed selected reaction monitoring (SRM) based assay for a panel of apolipoproteins and its application to a clinical cohort of samples derived from acute stroke patients. Experimental Design An SRM assay for a panel of nine apolipoproteins was developed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Quantitative data for each apolipoprotein were analyzed to determine expression ratio and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) values for ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke. Results The optimized SRM assay was used to interrogate a small cohort of well-characterized plasma samples obtained from patients with acute ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. The ROC analyses demonstrated good classification power for several single apolipoproteins, most notably apoC-III and apoC-I. When a novel multi-marker ROC algorithm was applied, the ischemic versus hemorrhagic groups were best differentiated by a combination of apoC-III and apoA-I with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.92. Conclusions and clinical relevance This proof-of-concept study provides interesting and provocative data for distinguishing ischemic versus hemorrhage within first week of symptom onset. However, the observations are based on one cohort of patient samples and further confirmation will be required.

AB  - Abstract Background:? There were 59 unprovoked shark attacks worldwide in 2008. Twelve of these occurred in Australia, ranking it as second only to the USA. In February 2009, two attacks occurred within 72?h in Sydney, Australia. Methods:? The two patients involved survived severe limb trauma. Case 1 suffered bite trauma to the lower limb and hand and underwent staged debridement and early amputation. Case 2 presented with a hand severed at the level of the wrist that was initially replanted. However, it would succumb to progressive necrosis after 12 days. We discuss the aspects of these cases that contributed to the patients' survival and ultimately good functional outcomes. Discussion:? New paradigms for the management of major trauma patients have emerged over the last decade. We consider recent advances in the understanding of pre-hospital tourniquet use, rapid transit to the operating suite and damage control surgery, and examine how they impacted on the management of our patients. Very little is known about the microbiology of shark bites. Organisms from sea water, the patient's skin and the shark's mouth must all be considered when selecting appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis. The planning of definitive surgery in severe limb trauma is dependent on the interactions of a number of factors including physical, psychological and social issues. The decision to ultimately replant or amputate the effected limb is best made in union with the patient and their family.

AB  - Abstract Tissue engineering has emerged at the intersection of numerous disciplines to meet a global clinical need for technologies to promote the regeneration of tissues. Recently, many authors have focused their attention on mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) for their capacity to differentiate into many cell lineages. The most widely studied cell types are bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), which display similar results. Biomaterials, cells, and growth factors are needed to design a regenerative plastic surgery approach in the treatment of organ and tissue defects, but not all tissues are created equal. The aim of this article is to describe the advances in tissue engineering through the use of ASCs, platelet rich plasma, and biomaterials to enable regeneration of damaged complex tissue.

AB  - SUMMARY Objective To determine the long-term survival of adult recipients (>16 years) transfused with red blood cells (RBC), platelets (PLT) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in England and Wales. Study design and methods The EASTR study (Epidemiology and Survival of Transfusion Recipients) was a national multi-centre epidemiological study with cross-sectional sampling from 29 representative hospitals in England supplied by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT). Three separate groups of RBC (n = 9142), FFP (n = 4232) and PLT (3584) recipients were sampled over 1 year (1 October 2001?30 September 2002), with prospective survival monitoring for 10 years. This study presents the data for adult recipients (>16 years of age). Results The median age interquartile range (IQR) of adult transfusion recipients was RBC 70 (54?79), FFP 66 (51?76), PLT 62 (48?72). The 10-year survival for adult RBC, FFP and PLT recipients was highest for RBC recipients at 36% confidence interval (CI 35?37%, n = 8675), compared with 30% for both FFP (CI 29?32%, n = 3849) and PLT (CI 28?30%, n = 3110) recipients. In all groups, post-transfusion survival decreased with age, and a risk-adjusted analysis showed that reason for transfusion, transfusion type (surgical or medical) and cancer diagnosis (presence or absence) were all significantly associated with survival. Older patients with cancer receiving a medical rather than surgical transfusion had the highest hazard of death. Conclusion This study shows that survival following transfusion in England is broadly similar to that reported in other wealthy nations. More than 70% of recipients die within 10 years of transfusion, but long-term survival is common in younger patients (>80% 10-year survival in RBC recipients aged 16?39 years).

AB  - Background:? Platelets are a rich source of proteins and growth factors that are instrumental in the initiation and modulation of tissue repair. The clinical use of crude platelet preparations has been around for decades. However, the use of autologous platelet gel (APG) for the treatment of wounds has become familiar practice in only the past 10 years. Platelet gels have been associated with accelerated vascular ingrowth, increased fibroblastic proliferation, and accelerated collagen production.x3 Objective:? The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of APG using a porcine wound healing model. Methods:? Platelet rich plasma (PRP) was obtained using a fully automated, easy-to-use devise. APG was created from PRP and autologous thrombin. Deep partial thickness wounds were created on specific pathogen-free pigs. Wounds were either treated with APG and covered with a polyurethane dressing, were treated only with a polyurethane dressing, or were left untreated. Wounds were assessed for epithelization using a well-established salt-split technique. Results:? Wounds treated with APG enhanced the rate of epithelization as compared to both polyurethane and untreated controls. Conclusions:? This study shows that an autologous platelet rich gel can stimulate and enhance epithelization of deep partial thickness wounds. Additional preclinical and clinical studies that examine mechanisms of action are warranted.

In both cases a basement membrane similar to that observed in pemphigoid was seen on direct immunofluorescence resulting from the non-specific absorption of immunoglobulins by the amyloid deposits. Evidence of a plasma cell dyscrasia was found in both patients, one of whom developed nephrotic syndrome.

AB  - ABSTRACT Platelet-rich plasma (PRP), the plasma portion of blood with a high platelet concentration, has been reported to be helpful in stem cell chondrogenesis due to large amount of growth factors it contains. Here, we examined the influence of PRP on the differentiation of synovium-derived stem cells (SDSCs) and also evaluated if PRP alone was sufficient to induce SDSCs differentiation. First, the cell proliferation in various differentiation media was analyzed using the MTT assay and it was significantly higher in groups cultured with media that contained PRP. Then, We performed Safranin-O staining and type I, II, and X collagen immunohistochemistry (chondrogenesis), von Kossa staining (osteogenesis), and Oil Red O staining (adipogenesis). The staining was most prominent in groups cultured with optimized differentiation media without PRP in all three lineages of differentiation. The mRNA expression levels of typical differentiation markers were also analyzed using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Although, culture in optimized differentiation media increased the mRNA expression of the typical differentiation marker genes, they were significantly reduced when cultured in the media supplemented with PRP. PRP has negative effects on SDSC differentiation in all three differentiation lineages and PRP alone does not induce SDSC differentiation. ? 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Background Uncontrolled hemorrhage is responsible for ?80% of the potentially survivable deaths in combat and over 40% of early mortality in the under 65 age group in the United States. Providing an easily used infusible hemostatic agent to first responders could significantly reduce these fatalities. We report on an infusible lyophilized platelet-derived hemostatic agent stabilized with trehalose and polysucrose prior to and during lyophilization. Study Design and Methods Characterization included determining the particle population size range, surface marker expression GPIb, GPIIbIIIa, and Annexin V binding. Function was assessed by aggregation, thromboelastography, and thrombin generation. Pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and immunogenicity established using Indium111 labeled Thrombosomes in healthy New Zealand white rabbits (NZWRs), efficacy in thrombocytopenic NZWR, and safety in NZWRs, canines, and nonhuman primates. Results Thrombosomes retained GPIIbIIIa expression (98.71%?Â±?0.18 of the rehydrated particles), a reduced expression of GPIb (47.77%?Â±?6.65), and Annexin V binding (86.05%?Â±?2.65). Aggregation to all agonists except thrombin in buffer (78.15%?Â±?2.5) was <50%. Thrombin generation and thromboelastography results demonstrated a concentration gradient that was consistent from lot to lot. There were no observed adverse events in any safety study and blood loss was reduced by >80% in the thrombocytopenic ear bleed model. Conclusion Our in vitro characterization studies in conjunction with preclinical animal safety and efficacy studies demonstrated lot consistency in manufacturing, maintenance of hemostatic functions of Thrombosomes, safety at high dose concentrations, and the potential to provide an effective hemostatic agent at the site of injury.

AB  - Abstract Bleeding complications arising from trauma, surgery, and as congenital, disease-associated, or drug-induced blood disorders can cause significant morbidities and mortalities in civilian and military populations. Therefore, stoppage of bleeding (hemostasis) is of paramount clinical significance in prophylactic, surgical, and emergency scenarios. For externally accessible injuries, a variety of natural and synthetic biomaterials have undergone robust research, leading to hemostatic technologies including glues, bandages, tamponades, tourniquets, dressings, and procoagulant powders. In contrast, treatment of internal noncompressible hemorrhage still heavily depends on transfusion of whole blood or blood's hemostatic components (platelets, fibrinogen, and coagulation factors). Transfusion of platelets poses significant challenges of limited availability, high cost, contamination risks, short shelf-life, low portability, performance variability, and immunological side effects, while use of fibrinogen or coagulation factors provides only partial mechanisms for hemostasis. With such considerations, significant interdisciplinary research endeavors have been focused on developing materials and technologies that can be manufactured conveniently, sterilized to minimize contamination and enhance shelf-life, and administered intravenously to mimic, leverage, and amplify physiological hemostatic mechanisms. Here, a comprehensive review regarding the various topical, intracavitary, and intravenous hemostatic technologies in terms of materials, mechanisms, and state-of-art is provided, and challenges and opportunities to help advancement of the field are discussed.

AB  - Abstract A role for CD36 in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, inflammation and lipid metabolism has been well-documented. However, little is known about the role of CD36 in cerebral ischemia. The intent of this review is to develop the concept that CD36, whose functions have been implicated in other pathological events, is a prototypic inflammatory receptor that contributes to the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia. The importance of CD36 as a treatment target is indicated by the fact that many treatment strategies that are effective in experimental models of stroke exhibit little or no efficacy in clinical trials. The failure of clinical trials may be due to the use of animal models of stroke that do not reflect traditional risk factors for stroke in humans. The discussion will be focused on two risk factors, hyperlipidemia and diabetes, that modulate CD36 responses. Blocking the expression and function of CD36 by pharmacological or genetic means will provide insight not only toward identifying CD36 as a novel molecular target but also for developing effective therapeutic strategies to treat stroke victims. More importantly, coupling clinically relevant conditions with CD36-mediated ischemic injury may provide an appropriate animal model paradigm and develop a scientific understanding that could lead to clinical translational studies involving human subjects.

AB  - Abstract Background Advanced platelet-rich fibrin (A-PRF) is an autogenous blood product with applications in dento-alveolar surgery. However, there is minimal information regarding its optimal clinical application or efficacy. The aim of this multi-arm parallel randomized controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy of A-PRF alone or with freeze-dried bone allograft (FDBA) in improving vital bone formation and alveolar dimensional stability during ridge preservation. Methods Forty patients requiring extraction of non-molar teeth and replacement with dental implants were randomized into one of four ridge preservation approaches: A-PRF, A-PRF+FDBA, FDBA, or blood clot. A-PRF was prepared at 1,300Â rpm for 8 minutes. Non-traumatic extractions and ridge preservation was performed. After an average of 15Â weeks healing, bone core samples were harvested at the time of implant placement for micro-CT and histomorphometric analysis. Ridge dimensions were measured immediately after extraction and before implant placement. Results Significantly greater loss of ridge height was noted in the blood clot group (3.8 Â± 2.0Â mm) compared to A-PRF (1.8 Â± 2.1Â mm) and A-PRF+FDBA (1.0 Â± 2.3Â mm) groups (PÂ <Â 0.05). No significant differences in ridge width reduction were noted between groups. Significantly more vital bone was present in the A-PRF group (46% Â± 18%) compared to the FDBA group (29% Â± 14%) (PÂ <Â 0.05). Bone mineral density was significantly greater in the FDBA group (551 Â± 58Â mg/cm3) compared to blood clot (487 Â± 64Â mg/cm3) (PÂ <Â 0.05). Conclusions This study demonstrates A-PRF alone or augmented with FDBA is a suitable biomaterial for ridge preservation. This study represents the first randomized controlled clinical trial comparing A-PRF with and without FDBA to FDBA alone for ridge preservation.

AB  - Studies on platelet dense granule structure were carried out in 20 patients with various types of congenital storage pool deficiency (SPD), including 15 with specific deficiencies of dense granules and dense granule substances (Î´-SPD), and five with combined deficiencies of dense and Î±-granules (Î±Î´-SPD). Dense granules were identified by their high affinity for uranyl ions (uranaffin reaction), by their ability to accumulate the fluorescent dye mepacrine, and by their inherent electron opacity on unfixed, unstained whole mount preparations. By all these methods, dense granules were markedly decreased in seven albino patients with the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) variant of Î´-SPD. These findings suggest that the basic defect in these patients is a specific abnormality in organelle development which prevents the formation of an intact granule structure, a quantitative abnormality which may differ from that in animals with related pigment disorders. In contrast, eight non-albino patients with Î´-SPD had, on average, only a slightly reduced number of uranaffin-positive and mepacrine-positive granules, but a shift in uranaffin-granule distribution towards those lacking a dense core (?empty granules?), suggesting a more qualitative type of dense granule defect. These results are consistent with previous evidence suggesting a decreased uptake of ATP across the granule membrane in Î´-SPD. In addition, on whole mounts, these patients?platelets contained substantial numbers of electron dense chains and clusters which contained P and Ca, but with a P/Ca ratio less than that of typical dense granules, and which were retained, along with a larger amount of ATP, after thrombin treatment of the platelets. The various findings in these patients raise the possibility that these structures may represent microvesicles, derived from the Golgi apparatus, which provide a transport mechanism for concentrating adenine nucleotides and calcium in dense granules and which is impaired in some patients with SPD. Additional defects may account for the more extensive granule abnormalities observed in Î±Î´-SPD.

AB  - Objectives: To compare the volume of in-stent neointimal proliferation, assessed by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), at 6-month follow-up after implantation of a coronary Carbofilm?-coated stent (Tecnic Carbostent?, Sorin Biomedica Cardio, Saluggia, Italy) versus a conventional 316 L stent (Rx Multi-Link Penta, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). Background: Many trials suggest that stent characteristics and coating could be important determinants of restenosis. Methods: From October 2004 to May 2005, 63 patients were randomized to Tecnic (T, n = 30) or Penta (P, n = 33). The primary end-point was in-stent volume of neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) measured by IVUS at 6 months. The secondary end-points included binary restenosis, minimal luminal diameter (MLD), target lesion revascularization, and major adverse cardiac events. Results: There were no significant differences between T and P as to mean age, male gender, clinical status, complexity of the lesion, lesion length, reference vessel diameter before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), MLD pre-PCI, and stent-to-artery ratio. However, MLD poststenting was greater in P group than T group (2.81 Â± 0.45 mm vs. 2.49 Â± 0.33 mm, P < 0.002). At 6 months, angiographic late lumen loss (0.61 Â± 0.51 mm vs. 0.92 Â± 0.61 mm, P < 0.043), in-stent obstruction (25.86 Â± 16.48% vs. 38.33 Â± 19.56%, P = 0.021), and in-stent late loss volume (31.62 Â± 29.75 mm3 vs. 57.28 Â± 37.16 mm3, P = 0.016) were significantly lower in T group than in P group. Conclusion: Penta stent appears to offer a better deployment and a larger MLD post-PCI than Carbofilm-coated stent. However, a thicker NIH was observed on Penta stent at 6-month follow-up, when compared to Tecnic.

AB  - Abstract Objective.? To determine whether pre- and post-operative administration of intravenous ibuprofen (IV-ibuprofen) can significantly decrease pain and morphine use when compared with placebo in adult orthopedic surgical patients. Design.? This was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Setting.? This study was completed at eight hospitals; six in the United States and two in South Africa. Patients.? A total of 185 adult patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery. Interventions.? Patients were randomized to receive either 800?mg IV-ibuprofen or placebo every 6 hours, with the first dose administered pre-operatively. Additionally, all patients had access to intravenous morphine for rescue. Outcome Measures.? Efficacy of IV-ibuprofen was demonstrated by measuring the patient's self assessment of pain using a visual analog scale (VAS; assessed with movement and at rest) and a verbal response scale (VRS). Morphine consumption during the post-operative period was also assessed. Results.? In the immediate post-operative period, there was a 25.8% reduction in mean area under the curve-VAS assessed with movement (AUC-VASM) in patients receiving IV-ibuprofen (P?<?0.001); a 31.8% reduction in mean AUC-VAS assessed at rest (AUC-VASR; P?<?0.001) and a 20.2% reduction in mean VRS (P?<?0.001) compared to those receiving placebo. Patients receiving IV-ibuprofen used 30.9% less morphine (P?<?0.001) compared to those receiving placebo. Similar treatment emergent adverse events occurred in both study groups and there were no significant differences in the incidence of serious adverse events. Conclusion.? Pre- and post-operative administration of IV-ibuprofen significantly reduced both pain and morphine use in orthopedic surgery patients in this prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial.

AB  - Abstract Background: Hypothermia is commonly used for organ and tissue preservation in multiple clinical settings, but its role in the management of injured patients remains controversial. There is no doubt that temperature modulation is a powerful tool, and hypothermia has been shown to protect cells during ischaemia and reperfusion, decrease organ damage and improve survival. Yet hypothermia is a double-edged sword: unless carefully managed, its induction can be associated with a number of complications. Methods: A literature review was performed to include important papers that address the impact of hypothermia on key biological processes, and explore the potential therapeutic role of hypothermia in trauma/haemorrhage models. Results: No clinical studies have been conducted to test the therapeutic benefits of hypothermia in injured patients. However, numerous well designed animal studies support this concept. Despite excellent preclinical data, there are several potential barriers to translating hypothermia into clinical practice. Conclusion: Therapeutic hypothermia is a promising life-saving strategy. Appropriate patient selection requires a thorough understanding of how temperature modulation affects various biological mechanisms. Copyright ? 2011 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd.

AB  - ABSTRACT Subluxation of a vertebra secondary to an injury (ie, traumatic spondyloptosis) is most commonly seen in the lumbosacral joint. This extremely rare spinal destabilization is caused by congenital defects, degeneration, tumors, infection, or trauma and is accompanied by severe neurologic debilitation. The patient's neurological function can be preserved when surgical team members have knowledge of spinal injuries, surgical interventions, positioning and its implications, and an awareness of the risks to the patient. Appropriate interventions can decrease complications, operative revisions, length of stay, morbidity and mortality, and hospital costs. AORN J 89 (April 2009) 657?672. ? AORN, Inc, 2009.

AB  - Abstract Bone grafts are an important part of orthopaedic surgeon's armamentarium. Despite well-established bone-grafting techniques, large bone defects still represent a challenge. Efforts have therefore been made to develop osteoconductive, osteoinductive, and osteogenic bone-replacement systems. The long-term clinical goal in bone tissue engineering is to reconstruct bony tissue in an anatomically functional three-dimensional morphology. Current bone tissue engineering strategies take into account that bone is known for its ability to regenerate following injury, and for its intrinsic capability to re-establish a complex hierarchical structure during regeneration. Although the tissue engineering of bone for the reconstruction of small to moderate sized bone defects technically feasible, the reconstruction of large defects remains a daunting challenge. The essential steps towards optimized clinical application of tissue-engineered bone are dependent upon recent advances in the area of neovascularization of the engineered construct. Despite these recent advances, however, a gap from bench to bedside remains; this may ultimately be bridged by a closer collaboration between basic scientists and reconstructive surgeons. The aim of this review is to introduce the basic principles of tissue engineering of bone, outline the relevant bone physiology, and discuss the recent concepts for the induction of vascularization in engineered bone tissue. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
