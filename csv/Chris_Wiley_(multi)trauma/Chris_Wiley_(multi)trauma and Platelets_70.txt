AB  - The use of autologous Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) has increased in Non Hodgkin?s Lymphoma. A patient, who had a relapse of Non Hodgkin?s Lymphoma after a remission of 13?years, required an autologous stem cell transplant. However, he was found to have cold agglutinins. The problem was raised as to whether or not he could have stem cells collected and if they would survive following freezing and storage. A literature search was undertaken and very little information found on stem cell collection in patients with cold agglutinins. Some anecdotal information was reported by colleagues all of which seemed to point to less than favourable outcomes. It was decided to mobilize the patient for stem cell collection and devise a method of collection, storage and transplantation. This paper will give an account of the collection, treatment and progress of the patient, and discuss the procedures involved. It will demonstrate the collaboration between medical, nursing and laboratory staff to achieve a positive patient outcome.

AB  - During their education all Medical Scientists will be exposed at some stage to the intricacies of blood grouping, crossmatching and the investigation of adverse responses to the transfusion of blood and blood products. For some, this exposure engenders fear and trepidation and they cannot wait to get into a discipline that is less demanding and stressful. For others the discipline is a challenge that allows them to use their problem solving skills and to experience the adrenal rush of responding to urgent requests for blood from theater or casualty to help save a bleeding patient. As in all disciplines of Laboratory Medicine, technology, especially information communication technology (ICT), is having a significant impact upon how blood transfusion science is being practiced. However unlike all other disciplines, blood transfusion is also subject to the regulations of the Therapeutic Goods Authority which impose a broad range of safety requirements on the products that Medical Scientist work with and release for patients. Whilst some testing technology such as column agglutination and ICT is seemingly simplifying the preparation and release of products for patients, developments in other areas are opening up new challenges. The creation of Cell Therapies laboratories in a number of the major hospitals in Australia is the latest development in transfusion practice. Could the next stage in our progression be the incorpor ation of the hospital blood bank into the Cell and Tissue Therapies Laboratory, where the testing and processing of all cell and tissue products is undertaken under the one coordinating body. This presentation will review the education and training of Medical Scientists at RMIT University for the discipline of Transfusion Science and present a perspective on where future directions in our educational programs might go.

AB  - The application of formal regulatory structures to the field of blood component and blood product manufacture is an understandable response to public and governmental concern over the safety of such products. Internationally the trend is to greater central control of blood service provision and regulation is one of several tools used to achieve this. In both Australia and New Zealand, blood components are treated as medicinal products for the purposes of regulation. The imminent creation of a TransTasman Regulatory Authority provides an opportunity to review systems used for the regulation of these products within Australasia and to ensure that an appropriate balance between clinical need and quality conformance is achieved. The control of human derived medicinal products presents a number of specific challenges. This is particularly the case in relation to blood components where biological variation will impact on the ?formulation? of any given product. Essentially each component becomes a unique batch. Efforts at control and regulation should recognise this. Two broad approaches can be used for regulation. In the first control is achieved through the application of standard processes. In the second the necessary outcome is defined but the process not formally defined. Increasingly regulatory control of blood component manufacture favours control of the process. Control through process can however ultimately restrict clinical flexibility and responsiveness. Care must be taken to ensure that this is recognised and addressed in the development of systems utilised to assure the quality and safety of blood components.

AB  - Since its establishment on 1 July 2003, the National Blood Authority (NBA) has been making steady progress towards fulfilling its vision of ?Saving and improving Australian lives through a world-class blood supply?. While the NBA?s early focus has been on developing organisational infrastructure and meeting compliance requirements as a new Commonwealth agency, it has already begun to bring about improvements to the management of the blood sector in line with the recommendations of the 2001 Stephen Review. As the centralised procurement agency for blood and blood products, the NBA is responsible for managing existing supply contracts with the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, CSL Limited and a number of pharmaceutical companies, and is currently negotiating new contracts with two major suppliers. The NBA has also been working with the signatories to the National Blood Agreement, all nine Australian Government Jurisdictions, to coordinate national demand and supply planning. It is introducing an agreed single national pricing schedule and has developed improved forecasting models and reporting mechanisms to ensure that jurisdictional requirements for blood and blood products are more closely matched to supply. With time, the NBA hopes to play a greater facilitation role in encouraging the better clinical use of blood and blood products as this will not only result in better patient outcomes, but will also contribute to ensuring the adequacy of the blood supply. This presentation discusses why the NBA was established, its roles and responsibilities, and how it is working to bring about reforms in the sector in terms of increased value for money, transparency and accountability.

AB  - Born at the dawn of the 20th Century, Transfusion Medicine has seen tremendous progress and technical achievement during the last 100?years. As the pace of change increases, the prospects for the future are even brighter. This lecture will review the recent past developments and provide conjecture on future advances in each of the following areas: blood donor services, infectious hazards, non-infectious hazards, process risk, diagnostics and therapeutics. Expectations of what may occur by 2010 and 2015 will be presented. Emerging technologies such as gene array and radio-frequency identification are likely to produce advances in the safety of blood transfusion therapy. More into the future, nanotechnology may re-invent the indications for blood therapies. The field of new therapeutics should be the fastest growing area and the lecture will highlight recent advances in drug development and molecular therapeutics as well as highlight coming technology such as robotic surgery. The therapeutic promise offered by nuclear transfer technology and its impact on cellular therapies will be addressed. With these new opportunities come new challenges and the lecture concludes with an impassioned reminder of the real challenges that await us.

AB  - Australian Rh(D) Immunoglobulin is produced by CSL Bioplasma using plasma containing anti-D collected by the Australian Red Cross Blood Service (ARCBS) from Australian voluntary blood donors. The ARCBS Rh Project was established, initially in New South Wales in 1967, with an aim of providing an adequate supply of Australian derived Rh(D) Immunoglobulin. In 1999, the NHMRC ?Guidelines on the prophylactic use of Rh(D) Immunoglobulin (Anti-D) in obstetrics? stated that universal prophylaxis with Rh(D) Immunoglobulin to RhD negative women with no preformed anti-D antibodies at 28 and 34 weeks gestation is generally regarded as best practice. With the availablity of Rh(D) Immunoglobulin at that time, the NHMRC recommended a phased implementation commencing with all Rh(D) negative primigravidae with no preformed anti-D antibodies (Phase 1). Phase 1 commenced in late 2002. The NHMRC recommemnded that full antenatal prophylaxis (phase 2) would be implemented when domestic supplies of Rh(D) Immunoglobulin increased sufficiently to cover the increased demand. The ARCBS plays an integral part in the implementation of universal antenatal prophylaxis by being the supplier of plasma containing anti-D for production and as the distributor of the final Rh(D) Immunoglobulin product. In 1999, the ARCBS supplied an average of 15???106?IU of anti-D per month to CSL Bioplasma. Implementation of phase 1 occurred following the introduction of two new products; the Australian derived Rh(D) Immunoglobulin 250?IU dose for first trimester indications and the temporary importation of WinRho SDFTM for postnatal use. Implementation of phase 2 and 3 requires the ARCBS to increase the amount of anti-D collected to an average of 30???106?IU and 45???106?IU per month, respectively. Phase 3 of the program is full antenatal prophylaxis supported entirely by domestic product. In 2002, additional funding was allocated to the ARCBS Rh Project to implement strategies to ensure that the input targets for phase 2 and 3 are achieved. In mid 2004, following months of primary immunisation and boosting of both new and existing donors, input levels began to consistently meet or exceed 30???106?IU, and planning for phase 2, implementation began. This presentation will give an overview of the strategies used by the ARCBS to increase the volume of anti-D collected from these donors.

AB  - In 1966, Sydney hosted the conference of the International Society of Blood Transfusion. At an Rh Symposium, experts revealed that several countries had conducted trials proving the safety and efficiency of anti-D in preventing Rh Haemolytic Disease of the Newborn. There have been no other major advances in the prevention of this tragic disease since that time. The source of anti-D in Australia is donated by a small group of Rh Project donors, and we depend entirely on them for the precious antibody which prevents Rh Disease. They have given magnificent service and thousands of babies have been saved. The Rh Project donors? contribution over 37?years is remarkable, inspiring and a triumph over disease.

AB  - As a cosmic element Oxygen is the third most abundant element in the universe. Its presence in the atmosphere and solubility in water makes life on Earth possible. As a human element Oxygen makes up approximately 60% of our body weight and access to too little or too much is fatal. Medically, Oxygen is an essential therapeutic element and its technical delivery has led to the development of blood transfusion, ventilators and intensive care units. The discovery and evolution of our understanding of Oxygen as ?The Molecule that made the World? is a story of genius, serendipity and politics. To the haematologist and transfusionist Oxygen?s relationship to the red cell and the haemoglobin molecule is a constant source of amazement and fascination. The red cell, the only cell in the body that is not dependent on Oxygen for energy production, has, in conjunction with the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, the awesome responsibility of delivery adequate amounts of Oxygen to every cell in the body 24 hours a day 7?days a week. Haemoglobin, probably the most studied molecular in biology, has been pivotal in the broader understanding of molecular structure and function and continues to reveal it?s secrets. Oxygen, as an economic element is essential to industry and as an environmental element is closely linked to conservation of planet Earth. Many sports have a close and frequently dubious interest in enhancing delivery of oxygen to the muscles. On the basis of doubtful people who feel the need are increasingly being enticed to ?Flood their bodies with Oxygen as therapy against our polluted World?. It is the presenter?s aim that this lecture will illustrate the paramount role of Oxygen to our existence and it?s central importance in the history of medicine, and blood transfusion in particular.

AB  - Aim? To review the operation of an Emergency Donor Panel in an isolated Australian community. Result? The Panel has been in operation for 4?years. Two donors have been rejected, one due to development of cancer and one due to biological false positive hepatitis C serology. Thirty five donors remain active on the panel. No donors have sero-converted for transmissable disease during the operation of the panel. The panel has been activated on 3 occasions, all for surgical bleeding, resulting in blood transfused within 40 minutes of activation in all cases. Two cases were for bleeding associated with ruptured AAA and one for bleeding associated with gangrenous bowel. Conclusion? A properly designed and monitored Emergency Donor Panel can safely supply blood for transfusion in the event of depletion of local stores. The EDP should be activated after 10 units of stored blood have been transfused into a patient undergoing massive bleeding from a correctible source, or in association with the hospital?s Disaster Plan.

AB  - In the late 1960s clinical trials showed that the incidence of Rh D immunisation of Rh negative women could be dramatically reduced by the administration of Rh D immunoglobulin (Ig) after delivery. In 1968 Australia became the first country to be self sufficient in Rh?D?Ig with the introduction of the Rh programme. Despite appropriate use of Rh?D?Ig 1?2% of Rh negative women still became immunised. Studies subsequently showed that immunisation rates could be further reduced by prophylactic administration of Rh?D?Ig during pregnancy. Routine antenatal prophylaxis has been practiced in Canada and USA for more than 20?years. The first NHMRC Clinical Practice Guidelines on the use of Rh?D?Ig were issued in 1999. These acknowledged that routine antenatal prophylaxis was best practice, however could not be recommended due to supply constraints. Subsequent initiatives included the licensing of the 250?IU dose of Rh?D?Ig, expansion of plasma collection and importation of product. Staged introduction of routine antenatal prophylaxis began in late 2002 with introduction of prophylaxis for primigravidae. Stage 2, which provides antenatal prophylaxis for all Rh?D?negative women, is to be implemented by 1 January 2005. Stage 3 will see cessation of the need for use of imported product. A Joint Consultative Committee of involved specialties is helping to ensure consultation and communication for the implementation process. The possibility of developing a laboratory Rh?D?Ig which could be produced in unlimited quantities, in a standardised formulation with no reliance on human derived sources has been entertained for many years. Results of trials of possible options have been intermittently published. However, it is likely that the ?liquid gold? anti D plasma donated by our amazing volunteers will be needed for many years to come.

AB  - Summary General recommendations for plasma transfusion have been well described in many guidelines. Therapeutic uses of plasma, in association with bleeding and abnormalities of coagulation tests (except in emergencies) are based on pathophysiological rationale, but questions about optimal dose and schedule of plasma. A recurring theme in many settings is an overall paucity of high-level evidence to inform optimal plasma transfusion practice remain unanswered, and this particularly applies to prophylactic uses of plasma. There should be more recognition of the limitations of current standard coagulation screening tests, and appreciation that in vitro abnormalities of coagulation screening tests do not equate with an in vivo failure of clinical haemostasis and the presence of clinical coagulopathy. Newer global tests of haemostasis may be better markers of abnormal bleeding risk, but should be assessed and validated in larger clinical studies. Given current evidence, a more appropriate plasma transfusion strategy may be one that emphasises the therapeutic use of plasma in bleeding patients. The role, if any, of prophylactic plasma transfusion in non-bleeding patients with abnormalities of standard coagulation tests, which have limited value in predicting bleeding remains very uncertain. Future research should identify the constituents in plasma that are providing the most benefit (e.g. by analogy the role of ADAMTS13 in TTP). With a better mechanistic understanding of disorders with acquired deficiencies of one or more coagulation factors, replacement might also be more appropriately managed in the future with concentrates of multiple coagulation factors, and which would minimise risks of circulatory overload described when high volume plasma transfusions are given.

AB  - Aim? Variant MNS (vMNS) phenotypes are characterised by the presence of multiple antigens that provoke complex antibody responses. The hypothesis tested was that red cell-agglutinating antibodies of a single specificity could be purified by affinity chromatography on peptides representing vMNS antigens. The Vw and Hut/Mut antigens vary only at glycophorin residue 28, Vw methionine-28, Hut and Mut lysine-28. The Mur peptide TYPAHTANEV was aa 33 to 42 of GpMur. For each experiment a 5?ml pool of 4 and 10 sera that agglutinated Mi-positive cells of known MNS-peptide-ELISA activity, was subjected to affinity chromatography on a single peptide. Result? For a serum pool that was strong peptide-ELISA positive with the lysine-28 peptide but was methionine-28 peptide negative, the antibody eluate was lysine-28 pos by ELISA and agglutinated all MUT and HUT pos cells tested but not Vw cells or Mi(a) negative cells. For the MUT antigen the hypothesis that a rbc-agglutinating antibody of a defined specificity could be purified by affinity chromatography on a linear peptide representing the antigen was confirmed. In a similar fashion a specific anti-Mur was prepared. However, for one serum pool the antibody eluted from the Mur-column reacted with Hut (MiII) as well as Mur-positive cells, suggesting that Mut.Mur was recognised as a single antigen. Conclusion? Purified monospecific polyclonal antibodies that define vMNS phenotypes may be useful in resolving difficult serological investigations. The complexity of responses to vMNS glycophorins is confirmed by the recovery of an antibody reacting with sequentially adjacent antigens as a single entity.

AB  - Aim? To find incidence of partial D variants in India and classify them by molecular techniques. Method? Partial D variants were identified by screening blood samples of subjects from Western India by using partial D kit (Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service). Molecular characterization of partial D variants was performed using multiplex PCR(M-PCR). Result? The incidence of partial D was 0.15% in the population studied. Forty eight partial D variant samples identified by serological studies were classified by M-PCR. 29% of partial D variants identified were of DFR and 14.6% were of DVI category. 77% of partial D variants identified in Indian population were characterized by M-PCR. Fifteen families of partial D variants were studied and ten more individuals of same variant were identified. All partial D variants were of R1r (DCe/dce) phenotype. The family studies showed partial D hybrid (RHD-CE-D) was linked with Ce gene. Conclusion? DFR was most frequently found partial D in Indian population. Majority of partial D variants characterized in Indian population arise due to substitution of part of RHD exon with RHCE equivalent.

AB  - Adherence of red blood cells (RBCs) to vascular endothelium impairs blood flow, decreases oxygen delivery and leads to vaso-occulusion. RBCs are relatively non-adherent however little is known of how changes to RBCs for transfusion during storage may affect their adherence properties. The aim of this study was to monitor adherence of stored RBCs to vascular endothelium under conditions of continuous flow in vitro. Specifically the influence of RBC storage time and leucocyte burden of stored red cell preparations was investigated. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs) were grown to confluence on fibronectin-coated coverslips. Nonleucocyte- reduced, buffy-coat-reduced and leucocyte-filtered RBC products were prepared according to standard blood bank procedures. RBC samples were collected at multiple time points until product expiry and perfused across an EC monolayer using a parallel flow chamber mounted to an inverted microscope. Perfusion of RBCs was controlled for shear stress and temperature. RBC-EC interactions were recorded using a digital camera attached to the microscope. The number of RBCs adhering to the EC layer progressively increased with product storage time. RBCs from products stored for 28 and 42?days were significantly more adherent than fresher cells. RBCs from products containing leucocytes were also significantly more adherent to the EC layer on days 28 and 42 of storage than RBCs from leucocyte-reduced products. Our findings indicate that product storage time and leucocyte burden increase the adhesion of RBCs to an EC layer. These results may lead to greater understanding of the interaction of transfused RBCs with recipient endothelium and the biological consequences of this adherence.

AB  - Serious and repeated infections with bacteria, yeast, and fungus continue to be a consequence of severe neutropenia. Previous attempts to prevent and/or treat these infections in severely neutropenic patients through use of neutrophil (PMN) transfusions achieved only modest success ? largely due to the collection and transfusion of relatively small numbers of PMNs. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has revolutionized the collection of PMNs for transfusion because stimulation of donors with G-CSF plus corticosteroids before leukapheresis permits collection of 6?8???10 to the 10 PMNs per each transfusion. Although questions and concerns have been raised about the biology and potential toxicity of giving G-CSF?+?steroids to normal allogeneic donors, these issues have questionable clinical significance. Properly controlled, clinical trials have not been performed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of PMN transfusions collected from donors stimulated with G-CSF?+?steroids. Therefore, despite the somewhat compelling ?logic? that transfusing very high numbers of PMNs should be helpful in treating serious infections in neutropenic patients, this practice can not be justified at this time. Indeed, published reports of individual patients and small series of patients have given mixed results (i.e., successes and failures). Hence, the need for properly-designed clinical trails.

AB  - In 2002 the Victoria Government, through a Blood Matters Collaborative, supported the introduction of Transfusion Nurse roles in participating Victorian Hospitals. The TN role, based on haemovigilance roles internationally, was key to the introduction of change initiatives undertaken as part of the collaborative project. TNs required a broad knowledge of transfusion practice along with training in organisational change and implementation of change concepts. Training for the TNs was provided through a Graduate Certificate in Transfusion Practice developed specifically for the project. This program has now been developed for online delivery. This paper will outline the role development and role vision developed for TNs throughout the Blood Matters Collaborative and considers the issues that have arisen since completion of the project in terms of role sustainability. Important issues include the place of TNs within organisational structures, development of sustainable systems of role integration and the ongoing integrity and sustainability of programs developed for role preparation.
