AB  - Summary Blood transfusion in surgery has long been understood to carry a fair amount of clinical risk despite its obvious benefits. For this reason, blood loss conservation and other methods for minimization of transfusion have become of paramount importance for the advancement of ongoing safe care of the surgical patient. This chapter will serve as an overall guide to understanding the availability, cost, and usage of blood products in surgery. Additionally, we will discuss techniques used during procedures that play a role in minimization of transfusion. Further, the potential benefits of unnecessary blood transfusion in surgical patients will be explained with a goal of improving outcomes in the future.

AB  - The hemopoietic growth factors are peptide hormones that are known to be responsible for the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of bone marrow progenitor cells into mature differentiated cells. These cytokines have had a major impact on the management of patients with cytopenias and have been extensively used as an adjunct to the management of patients with hematologic malignancies, with or without prior intensive chemotherapy. Other potential uses, being rigorously studied, include the potential mobilization of stem cells as well as recruitment phase-specific cells into the cell cycle, thus providing a more sensitive environment for targeting specific chemotherapeutic agents.

AB  - Abstract Polymeric biomaterials are being widely used for the treatment of various traumata, diseases and defects in human beings due to ease in their synthesis. As biomaterials have direct interaction with the extracellular environment in the biological world, biocompatibility is a topic of great significance. The introduction or enhancement of biocompatibility in certain polymers is still a challenge to overcome. Polymer biocompatibility can be controlled by surface modification. Various physical and chemical methods (e.g., chemical and plasma treatment, ion implantation, and ultraviolet irradiation etc.) are in use or being developed for the modification of polymer surfaces. However an important limitation in their employment is the alteration of bulk material. Different surface and bulk properties of biomaterials are often desirable for biomedical applications. Because extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation penetration is quite limited even in low density mediums, it could be possible to use it for surface modification without influencing the bulk material. This article reviews the degree of biocompatibility of different polymeric biomaterials being currently employed in various biomedical applications, the surface properties required to be modified for biocompatibility control, plasma and laser ablation based surface modification techniques, and research studies indicating possible use of EUV for enhancing biocompatibility. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Patients with heart failure (HF) are at an increased risk of stroke, sudden death and venous thromboembolism, which are all linked to thrombus formation (thrombogenesis). The present ?viewpoint? article will discuss how the prothrombotic state in HF may be perpetuated by a chronic inflammatory state that is maladaptive. Indeed, there is considerable evidence that thrombogenesis and endothelial (dys)function can be intimately linked to inflammation in HF.

AB  - Leukoreduction of blood products is a technique used to prevent leukocyte-induced transfusion reactions. Filters currently used for human blood products achieve at least a 99.9% reduction in leukocyte numbers per unit (450 mL) of blood. Goals of this study were to determine if a prestorage leukoreduction filter could effectively achieve leukoreduction of canine blood and to determine if viability of the leukoreduced red blood cell (RBC) product could be maintained after 35 days of storage. Blood collected from each dog was filtered through a leukoreduction filter at either room temperature or after cooling (4Â°C) for 4 hours. Filtration efficacy was determined by measurement of pre- and postfiltration leukocyte counts. In vitro viability of RBCs was determined by comparing RBC adenosine triphosphate concentration and percent hemolysis before and after the storage period. In vivo viability of stored cells was determined using a biotin-streptavidin-phycoerythrin labeling technique and flow cytometry. Blood filtered within 30 minutes of collection versus blood filtered after cooling had mean reductions in leukocyte numbers of 88.90 and 99.99%, respectively. The mean ATP and hemoglobin concentrations from the in vitro analysis were comparable to those obtained in previously for canine RBC adequately stored for 35 days. The mean in vivo 24-hour survival of the stored RBC was 84.7%. The leukoreduction filter used did not adversely affect in vitro or in vivo viability of canine RBCs. The filter effectively removed leukocytes from blood, with maximal efficiency of filtration achieved with use of cooled blood.
