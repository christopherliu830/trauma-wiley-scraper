AB  - Since the discovery of scarless fetal skin wound healing, research in the field has expanded significantly with the hopes of advancing the finding to adult human patients. There are several differences between fetal and adult skin that have been exploited to facilitate scarless healing in adults including growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix substitutes. However, no one therapy, pathway, or cell subtype is sufficient to support scarless wound healing in adult skin. More recently, products that contain or mimic fetal and adult uninjured dermis were introduced to the wound healing market with promising clinical outcomes. Through our review of the major experimental targets of fetal wound healing, we hope to encourage research in areas that may have a significant clinical impact. Additionally, we will investigate therapies currently in clinical use and evaluate whether they represent a legitimate advance in regenerative medicine or a vulnerary agent.

Economic Aspects Blood is a multifunctional transport medium of vital importance for the body of higher organisms. Its composition is very complex and includes various cell systems with peculiar functions, proteins, electrolytes, metabolites, and highly sophisticated mediator systems. Both cells and plasma, which can be separated by centrifugation, can be used as and further processed into medicines. Serum is the fluid remaining after coagulation of the blood. In this review, blood cell systems and plasma proteins are referred to and medicinal aspects including blood and plasma collection and processing are described. The medicines derived from blood and plasma, as well as basic research and clinical trials should keep an important place because of the medicine as a whole benefits extremely from transfusions and, in particular, hemophiliacs gain an enormous improvement of life quality and life expectancy.

AB  - The introduction of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) substantially changed the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease. Stent thrombosis is the most worrisome early complication in patients undergoing PCI. Therefore, antiplatelet therapy forms an integral component of treatment with intracoronary stent implantation. A multitude of randomized and observational studies have helped identify and define the role of clopidogrel in today's PCI patient. Although much is known about its use, a number of questions still remain.

AB  - Abstract Fibrosis and scar formation results from chronic progressive injury in virtually every tissue and affects a growing number of people around the world. Myofibroblasts drive fibrosis, and recent work has demonstrated that mesenchymal cells, including pericytes and perivascular fibroblasts, are their main progenitors. Understanding the cellular mechanisms of pericyte/fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition, myofibroblast proliferation and the key signalling pathways that regulate these processes is essential to develop novel targeted therapeutics for the growing patient population suffering from solid organ fibrosis. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about different progenitor cells of myofibroblasts, discuss major pathways that regulate their transdifferentiation and discuss the current status of novel targeted anti-fibrotic therapeutics in development.

AB  - Abstract Objective To review the therapeutic options for immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (IMT). Data Sources Original research publications and review articles using the PubMed search engine for the phrases ?immune-mediated thrombocytopenia? or ?immune thrombocytopenic purpura? or ?immune thormbocytopenia.? Veterinary and Human Data Synthesis There are a number of therapeutic options for adult-onset immune thrombocytopenia in human medicine with demonstrated efficacy in clinical studies although corticosteroids and immunoglobulin therapy remain the first-line medical treatments. Thrombopoietin receptor agonist therapy and, to a lesser extent, rituximab have shown great promise in initial clinical trials and may become standard of care in human medicine for the management of IMT. Therapeutic options in veterinary medicine are less diverse and only vincristine and human intravenous immunoglobulin therapies have been evaluated in controlled clinical studies. Conclusions There are a number of therapeutic options in the management of IMT veterinary medicine, most of which have not been investigated in clinical studies. Further research is warranted to best identify the optimal treatment strategy for IMT in veterinary patients.

AB  - Abstract Concentration gradients play an important role in controlling biological and pathological processes, such as metastasis, embryogenesis, axon guidance, and wound healing. Microfluidic devices fabricated by photo- and soft lithography techniques can manipulate the fluidic flow and diffusion profile to create biomolecular gradients in a temporal and spatial manner. Furthermore, microfluidic devices enable the control of cell-extracellular microenvironment interactions, including cell?cell, cell?matrix, and cell?soluble factor interaction. In this paper, we review the development of microfluidic-based gradient devices and highlight their biological applications.

AB  - Background Spontaneous hepatic rupture is a well recognised but rare condition. Because of the difficulty in diagnosis, it is often associated with a high mortality rate. Pregnant women with HELLP syndrome are more prone to hepatic rupture, but it can also occur with other liver pathology. Different modalities of treatment, including liver resection, packing, hepatic artery ligation and even liver transplantation have been described for this condition. Patients and results We report a series of five cases, three of which were associated with pregnancy and two with no identifiable pathology. Pre-operative diagnosis was not made in any of these cases. Two of the five patients had hepatic resection, two had peri-hepatic packing and one was treated with laparoscopic drainage. Discussion From our experience we conclude that no single form of treatment is applicable to all cases of hepatic rupture. The treatment should be individualised, depending on the extent of hepatic rupture and the expertise available, to obtain best outcome.

AB  - Abstract Bleeding complications usually cause significant morbidity and mortality in civilian and military populations. In clinical application, hemostatic sponges, gauzes, hydrogel, and bandages are widely used as the traditional effective hemostatic products for hemorrhage. However, the traditional hemostatic devices or agents cannot meet the requirement for treatment of massive bleeding. Therefore, the excellent hemostatic performance of hemostatic products are of great significance for saving lives. Natural polysaccharides, as the main chemical component, have been widely used in the preparation of hemostasis due to their perfect biocompatibility and biodegradability. Polysaccharide based hemostatic products are available in variety of forms, such as, hydrogel, sponges, gauze and microspheres. The purpose of the present review is to report the research progress on polysaccharide hemostatic products and technology.
