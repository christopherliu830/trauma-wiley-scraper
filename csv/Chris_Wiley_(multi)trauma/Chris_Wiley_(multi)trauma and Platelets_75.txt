AB  - Abstract Bleeding complications usually cause significant morbidity and mortality in civilian and military populations. In clinical application, hemostatic sponges, gauzes, hydrogel, and bandages are widely used as the traditional effective hemostatic products for hemorrhage. However, the traditional hemostatic devices or agents cannot meet the requirement for treatment of massive bleeding. Therefore, the excellent hemostatic performance of hemostatic products are of great significance for saving lives. Natural polysaccharides, as the main chemical component, have been widely used in the preparation of hemostasis due to their perfect biocompatibility and biodegradability. Polysaccharide based hemostatic products are available in variety of forms, such as, hydrogel, sponges, gauze and microspheres. The purpose of the present review is to report the research progress on polysaccharide hemostatic products and technology.

AB  - A total of 1,921 leukapheresis procedures have been performed on 532 normal and CIVIL donors at six research institutions, for the purpose of supporting granulocytopenic leukemia patients during infectious episodes. The addition of HES alone or in combination with either etiocholanolone or dexamethasone, resulted in a significant increase in the numbers of leukocytes (granulocytes) harvested by continuous and noncontinuous flow centrifugation. Normal donors participating in these programs were monitored prior to and immediately following each procedure by standard laboratory methods which revealed no serious or abnormal changes occurring as a result of the procedure in those undergoing single or multiple donations with these agents. CIVIL donors tolerated the addition of only HES well, as evidenced by the lack of toxic reactions in three donors undergoing 101 to 121 procedures.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents the available methods for wound healing. Topics such as microenvironment of chronic diabetic wounds, wound preparation, the use of proper dressings and methods for off-loading the ulcer area are covered. The chapter discusses the methods of augmenting ulcer healing, such as the topical or systemic use of growth factors, bioengineered skin substitutes, extracellular matrix proteins and regenerating agents. It provides information on the indications and use of negative-pressure therapy and hyperbaric oxygen. The term ?wound bed preparation? applies to facilitation of the healing process by optimizing the base and edges of the wound. Debridement should be employed to all chronic wounds to remove surface debris and necrotic tissues. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) acts on epithelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells to promote healing. Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has emerged as a new treatment for diabetic foot ulcers.

AB  - ABSTRACT A bubble oxygenator (the TM or the OCVC oxygenator) has been produced with development efforts focused particularly on reduction of the nonphysiological characteristics of this type of oxygenator. The structural features of the apparatus are: (1) a reduction to the minimum of adequate priming volume, (2) an oxygen disperser designed to ensure evenly dispersed, uniform-sized bubbles, (3) a volume-control system for the oxygenating chamber (the OCVC system) based on extensive experimental oxygenation studies, and (4) an integrated double microfilter of the gravity-drainage type. Clinical features are: (1) ease of operation in perfusion, (2) reduction in hemolysis and postoperative blood loss, and (3) fewer complications associated with microemboli. Clinical use on over 200 infants and children proved generally very satisfactory. The background of its development is briefly described as are future modification plans.

AB  - In connection with an osteological study of more than one hundred complete, disarticulated skeletons of the Norwegian Fjord and D?le horse breeds in the collection of the University Museum of Bergen, attention was drawn to the ossified parts of the rib cartilages because of frequent healed fractures transverse to the cartilages. Unossified cartilage had been removed, so the ossified cartilages were available as dry specimens. The skeletons derive from pedigreed stallions as well as some few mares, so both name, year of birth and age are known. Most often the age was between 15 and 30?years, but some few horses were younger, the youngest 5-year-old. Ocular inspection of each skeleton revealed that healed fractures occurred in ossified rib cartilages of every horse, varying from some few instances to >30. Skeletons of horses of other races in the museum collection corroborated this. Healing of the fractures was obvious. Four kinds were observed: The first, and probably least sincere fracture appeared as a visible transverse ring, the second displayed callus elevation around the fracture, the third showed dislocation and callus formation, and the fourth concerns pseudoarthrosis, when fractured parts fail to unite during healing. Even a fifth kind may be considered, with circumferential callus formation leaving the interior healed but unfused. X-ray displays the fractures as white, cross-sectional bands of bone repair. However, such fractures appear not to be considered in contemporary veterinary pathology, but the large number of fractures observed in some cases, callus formation and dislocation of fractures in others, indicates that some period following these fractures is likely to have been traumatic to the horse, so that fracture of ossified rib cartilages should not be ruled out concerning horses showing unexplained symptoms of pain.

AB  - Abstract Background The objective of this study was to evaluate our new protocol for performing non-operative management for selected unstable patients under hypotensive resuscitation using improved diagnostic imaging techniques. Methods This retrospective study included 77 consecutive patients with blunt liver injury. They were divided into two groups: those treated before and those treated after the revision. Under the new protocol, we attempted to manage the patients non-operatively, usually with angioembolization, including those whose shock improved with fluid resuscitation and continuous loading, permitting the maintenance of a target systolic blood pressure of 80?mmHg. The outcomes of the two groups were evaluated and compared. Results While comparing the groups, although there was no change in the liver-related morbidity and mortality rates, the urgent and overall laparotomy rates and transfusion requirements in 24?h significantly decreased after the protocol revision. While comparing the subgroups of high-grade injury (AAST Grades 3?5), the overall laparotomy rates and transfusion requirements in 24?h significantly decreased after the protocol revision. Conclusions All the selected unstable patients were successfully managed non-operatively after the protocol revision. The decrease in laparotomy rates and transfusion requirements confirmed the feasibility of our new protocol for these selected patients.

AB  - As infectious complications from blood transfusion have decreased because of sophisticated blood screening, non-infectious side-effects have emerged as the most common complications of transfusion in industrialized countries. Despite making every endeavour, quite a number of these side-effects are very difficult to control. Some of these side-effects present as acute transfusion reactions, the most important of which are transfusion-related acute lung injury, circulatory overload, sepsis, and allergic and anaphylactic reactions. Acute adverse events require immediate action, but are often difficult to evaluate. On the other hand, transfusion recipients may experience delayed non-infectious side effects, including, non-ABO haemolytic transfusion reactions, graft-versus-host disease, and post-transfusion purpura. In addition, a not well-defined risk of increased mortality following blood transfusion has been recognized. Some aspects regarding the clinical presentation, the physiology behind, and possible preventive measures are summarized here.

AB  - Summary.? Pregnancy, labour and delivery present intrinsic haemostatic challenges to women with and carriers of bleeding disorders and their offspring. Deficiency of fibrinogen and factor XIII are associated with miscarriage, placental abruption and foetal loss. The risk of antenatal complications including antepartum haemorrhage is unknown in women with other bleeding disorders. There is a significant risk of postpartum haemorrhage (primary and secondary) in women with all types of bleeding disorders. This can be serious and life threatening in those with severe defects such as Bernard Soulier syndrome and Glanzmann?s thrombasthenia. Three to four percent of infants with haemophilia experience cranial bleeding that occurs during labour and delivery. The safest method of delivery for affected babies remains controversial. However, the rate of planned Caesarean section is increasing among known carriers of haemophilia. If vaginal delivery is planned, prolonged labour and difficult delivery especially vacuum extraction are associated with the highest risk of cranial bleeding and should be avoided. The optimal management of pregnancy in women with inherited bleeding disorders requires a multidisciplinary approach and advanced individualized management plan taking into consideration obstetric and bleeding risk factors. Women with mild or moderate bleeding disorders can be managed at their local maternity unit in close collaboration with a tertiary centre. However, those with severe or rare disorders or carrying an affected infant should be managed in a tertiary centre with an onsite Haemophilia centre.

AB  - Abstract Patients with von Willebrand disease (VWD) and haemophilia A (HA) lack, to varying degrees, the von Willebrand factor (VWF) and coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) that are critical for normal haemostasis. These conditions in turn make patients prone to uncontrolled bleeding. Historically, patients with severe forms of VWD or HA were crippled before adulthood and their life expectancy was significantly reduced. Over the past decades, specific coagulation factor replacement therapies including Haemate?P, have been developed to help patients achieve and maintain normal haemostasis. Haemate?P is a human, plasma-derived VWF/FVIII medicinal product, which was first licensed in Germany in 1981 for the treatment of HA-associated bleeding. It has since then come to be accepted as the gold standard for both the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in VWD, especially in cases where desmopressin [1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP)] has been ineffective. Haemate?P was the first effectively virus-inactivated (pasteurisation: 60°C for 10?h in aqueous solution) FVIII product, whereby the risk of potentially threatening infective complications of plasma-derived products was reduced. Haemate?P was also shown to have a VWF multimer profile remarkably close to that of normal plasma. This bibliographic review presents previously unpublished clinical data of Haemate?P, based upon internal clinical study reports of the proprietor, CSL Behring, in addition to data already presented in other publications. The data demonstrate a predictable and well-characterised pharmacokinetic profile, and a proven record of short- and long-term safety, while effectively correcting the haemostatic defects in VWD and HA. Recently available data have also shown Haemate?P to be of haemostatic value in exceptional clinical circumstances including surgical interventions. By virtue of its plasma-derived combination of VWF and FVIII, in addition to its high VWF:FVIII content ratio (2.4:1), Haemate?P is also associated with successful immune tolerance induction in those patients developing inhibitor antibodies. Although the theoretical risk of thromboembolic complications does exist while receiving Haemate?P, as it does with any FVIII replacement therapy, the incidence of such complications has remained notably low. Given the robust data that have accumulated for the use of Haemate?P, dosing recommendations are also described in this review; the recommendations are tailored to patient-specific contexts including baseline VWF and FVIII levels in plasma and the type of surgical intervention being undertaken. A wide variety of studies have also provided data on paediatric and geriatric populations, all of which have suggested that Haemate?P can be safely and effectively used in a wide variety of clinical circumstances.

AB  - Summary.? Background: Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most frequent inherited bleeding disorder. Whether VWD is associated with health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in children is unknown. Objectives: This nationwide cross-sectional study measured HR-QoL in children with moderate or severe VWD. Our primary aim was to compare HR-QoL of VWD patients with that of reference populations. Additionally, we studied the impact of bleeding phenotype and VWD type on HR-QoL. Methods: HR-QoL was assessed with the Infant/Toddler QoL Questionnaire (0?5 years) and Child Health Questionnaire (6?15 years), and compared with reference population scores. Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate the influence of type of VWD and bleeding phenotype on HR-QoL scores. Results: Preschool children (0?5 years, n?=?46) with VWD had lower HR-QoL scores for general health perceptions and parental time than reference populations. School children (6?15 years, n?=?87) with VWD had lower scores for physical functioning, role functioning ? emotional/behavioral, general health perceptions, and physical summary. Type of VWD was associated with HR-QoL in school children for bodily pain, general health perceptions, parental emotion, family activities, and physical summary. Scores of children with type 3 VWD were, on average, 15 points lower than those of the reference population on the above-mentioned scales. A more severe bleeding phenotype was associated with a lower score on 11/15 physical, emotional and social scales. Conclusion: HR-QoL is lower in VWD children than in reference populations, in particular in school children. The negative impact of VWD is sensitive to type of VWD and bleeding phenotype; as well as physical scales, emotional and social scales are affected.

AB  - Summary Oral medicine relates to the diagnosis and management of a wide variety of nonsurgical and mostly nonodontogenic problems of the oral cavity and maxillofacial region, principally including oral mucosal diseases, salivary gland disorders, and orofacial pain. These problems can be subdivided into those that are local vs. those that represent oral manifestations of systemic disease and medical therapy. All oral medicine problems fall under one or more subjective complaints and/or objective signs. Patients may present with one or more of the following nine symptoms (i.e., subjective indicators): altered mucosa, pain/altered sensation, xerostomia/dry mouth, malodor, slow healing, swelling, bleeding, altered oral function (opening, eating, speaking, swallowing, etc.), or problems with teeth. This chapter serves as a problem-oriented approach to the more common oral medicine problems, and the approach is a categorization of these problems based upon presenting signs and symptoms.
