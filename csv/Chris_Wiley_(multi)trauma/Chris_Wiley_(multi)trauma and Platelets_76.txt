AB  - Summary Oral medicine relates to the diagnosis and management of a wide variety of nonsurgical and mostly nonodontogenic problems of the oral cavity and maxillofacial region, principally including oral mucosal diseases, salivary gland disorders, and orofacial pain. These problems can be subdivided into those that are local vs. those that represent oral manifestations of systemic disease and medical therapy. All oral medicine problems fall under one or more subjective complaints and/or objective signs. Patients may present with one or more of the following nine symptoms (i.e., subjective indicators): altered mucosa, pain/altered sensation, xerostomia/dry mouth, malodor, slow healing, swelling, bleeding, altered oral function (opening, eating, speaking, swallowing, etc.), or problems with teeth. This chapter serves as a problem-oriented approach to the more common oral medicine problems, and the approach is a categorization of these problems based upon presenting signs and symptoms.

AB  - Inspired by the physiological events of the ?wound healing cascade?, the integration of biomaterials and growth factors is generally accepted as an emerging and powerful strategy for bone regenerative therapy. As a type of biological mediator, growth factors play a key role in functional bone regeneration. In this review, recent progress in the enhancement of bone-related growth factors via a biomaterial strategy will be discussed. Two main reinforcing mechanisms, temporal regulation and efficacy manipulation, are described in detail, highlighting the potential capability of biomaterials to harness the interactions between growth factors and specific cells. The effects of biomaterials for promoting bone formation via growth factor-mediated osteogenesis are further elucidated. Finally, an outlook of the prospects in terms of superior communication among growth factors, cells, and biomaterials in the microenvironment is presented, which might provide new directions for the design of medical devices for bone regeneration.

AB  - Summary Mechanical devices used to support the failing heart or respiratory systems continue to improve and their use is continuing to increase. As outcomes have improved the number of indications for use has increased and the threshold for use continues to decline, recognizing that a persistent low cardiac output state has greater risk of organ injury or death than institution of mechanical support of the circulation. Likewise, higher pressure of mechanical ventilator support can produce greater injury to the lung than the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The most rapid area of advancement is in the long-term use of ventricular assist devices. Children with previous terminal conditions can now be supported for many months and eventually undergo heart transplantation if their heart does not recover. Echocardiography plays an essential role in determining when mechanical support of the circulation is indicated, and for accurate placement and de-airing of devices. With the smaller surface area of new mechanical devices, there is less blood exposure to artificial surface and therefore reduced need for anticoagulation; however, thromboembolic and bleeding complications remain relatively high.

AB  - Abstract Objectives/Hypothesis: Laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS) represents a significant treatment dilemma faced by otolaryngologists. Recent topical use of Mitomycin C as an adjunctive treatment has proved helpful but does not completely prevent stenosis. Current literature suggests that transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) plays a significant role in the development of subglottic stenosis. We modified an existing canine model to test antitransforming growth factor beta (anti-TGFB) as a possible treatment for laryngotracheal stenosis. Study Design: Pilot study in a modified canine model. Methods: Eight mixed-breed dogs underwent cautery injury to the subglottic region creating subsequent laryngotracheal stenosis. Four dogs were treated with saline injection into the injury site and four dogs were treated with a combination of intravenous (5 mg/kg on day 0 and 5 of the experiment) and local injection of anti-TGFB (50 micrograms). Results: In the canine model of induced subglottic airway injury, a combination of intralesional and intravenous anti-TGFB results in a reduction in tracheal stenosis (P < .05) and an increase in survival time (P < .03) when compared to the saline control subjects. Conclusions: Anti-TGFB appears to be a useful adjunct in the treatment of LTS. Further study regarding the optimal dosing, route of administration, and timing of delivery is needed to understand the role of anti-TGFB in the treatment for laryngotracheal stenosis.

AB  - Abstract Recent advances in analytical cytometry have improved diagnostic tools for the study of erythropoiesis in anemic patients and resolution of differential diagnosis in diseases of the erythron. This article presents three applications of red blood cell (RBC) analysis?quantitation of fetal red cells, F-cell enumeration, and F-reticulocyte analysis?which improve diagnostic precision, sensitivity, and specificity, and provide better laboratory indicators of therapeutic efficacy in a variety of hematologic and obstetric disorders. Such advances also include the measurement and quantitation of RBC hemoglobins and their relative ribonucleic acid levels. These advances not only promise to improve diagnostic accuracy and laboratory precision over techniques such as the traditional manual reticulocyte counting method and the Kleihauer-Betke stain method for evaluating fetomaternal hemorrhage (FMH), but also serve as tools for newer assays of anemia diagnosis and improved clinical outcomes. In addition to the primary methods, supporting techniques for preparing spiked controls, automating data analysis, setting up a fetal hemoglobin acquisition protocol, and assaying reticulocytes using thiazole orange are also presented. ? 2019 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Summary The pathologic changes of preeclampsia can affect every organ system and consequently may significantly compromise both mother and fetus. Many of these end-organ and cellular changes affect decisions the anesthesia and delivery team make, from timing and route of delivery to type of anesthesia and postpartum care. This chapter reviews the evidence that should guide the care of a mother affected by severe preeclampsia or eclampsia, including the diagnosis of preeclampsia, management of acute hypertension, effect of regional and general anesthesia on both mother and fetus and the impact of common medical complications of preeclampsia, focusing on how they change anesthetic management and care.

AB  - Summary As perioperative transfusions account for greater than half of the more than 20 million units of blood and blood products that are administered each year in the United States, strategies to limit the use of allogeneic blood products will need to be focused on the perioperative period. Additionally, given the acuity of illness of surgical patients and the impact of a many surgical procedure on homeostasis, avoidance of perioperative transfusions may greatly alter patient outcomes including the incidence of nosocomial infections, duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation, length or stay and even mortality. Of the surgical procedures recognized as being associated with significant blood loss, cardiothoracic, hepatic and major orthopedic procedures especially those involving the hip, pelvis and spine lead the list with estimated losses that may exceed one-half to an entire blood volume. Given these issues, there remains a significant need to avoid or limit the use of allogeneic blood products especially during the perioperative period and in critically ill patients. The following chapter reviews several of the potential options for limiting allogeneic blood product use during the perioperative period. Techniques to be reviewed include: (1) general considerations such as the optimization of preoperative coagulation function, correction of preoperative anemia, and intraoperative anesthetic technique including fluid therapy, proper patient positioning, and maintenance of normothermia; (2) autologous transfusion therapy including preoperative donation or intraoperative collection using acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) with or without the use of erythropoietin as well as intraoperative and postoperative blood salvage; (3) pharmacologic manipulation of the coagulation cascade with anti-fibrinolytic agents, desmopressin (DDAVP), recombinant coagulation factors (VII and XIII) or novel agents undergoing phase II and III trials; and (4) controlled hypotension. In many instances, the performance of major surgical procedures without the use of allogeneic blood products can only be accomplished by combining several of these techniques.

AB  - Abstract Despite very significant technical and software improvements in flow cytometry (FCM) since the 1980's, the demand for a cytometric technology combining both quantitative cell analysis and morphological documentation in Cytomics became evident. Improvements in microtechnology and computing permit nowadays similar quantitative and stoichiometric single cell-based high-throughput analyses by microscopic instruments, like Slide-Based Cytometry (SBC). SBC and related techniques offer unique tools to perform complex immunophenotyping, thereby enabling diagnostic procedures during early disease stages. Multicolor or polychromatic analysis of cells by SBC is of special importance not only as a cytomics technology platform but also because of low quantities of required reagents and biological material. The exact knowledge of the location of each cell on the slide permits repetitive restaining and reanalysis of specimens. Various separate measurements of the same specimen can be ultimately fused to one database increasing the information obtained per cell. Relocation and optical evaluation of cells as typical SBC feature, can be of integral importance for cytometric analysis, since artifacts can be excluded and morphology of measured cells can be documented. Progress in cell analytic: In the SBC, new horizons can be opened by the new techniques of structural and functional analysis with the high resolution from intracellular and membrane (confocal microscopy, nanoscopy, total internal fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), and tissue level (tissomics), to organ and organism level (in vivo cytometry, optical whole body imaging). Predictive medicine aims at the detection of changes in patient's state prior to the manifestation of the disease or the complication. Such instances concern immune consequences of surgeries or noninfectious posttraumatic shock in intensive care patients or the pretherapeutic identification of high risk patients in cancer cytostatic therapy. Preventive anti-infectious or anti-shock therapy as well as curative chemotherapy in combination with stem cell transplantation may provide better survival chances for patient at concomitant cost containment. Predictive medicine-guided optimization of therapy could lead to individualized medicine that gives significant therapeutic effect and may lower or abrogate potential therapeutic side effects. The 10th Leipziger Workshop combined with the 3rd International Workshop on SBC aimed to offer new methods in Image- and Slide-Based Cytometry for solutions in clinical research. It moved towards practical applications in the clinics and the clinical laboratory. This development will be continued in 2006 at the upcoming Leipziger Workshop and the International Workshop on Slide-Based Cytometry. ? 2005 International Society for Analytical Cytology

AB  - Abstract The brain is unquestionably the most fascinating organ, and the hippocampus is crucial in memory storage and retrieval and plays an important role in stress response. In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the seizure origin typically involves the hippocampal formation. Despite tremendous progress, current knowledge falls short of being able to explain its function. An emerging approach toward an improved understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms that underlie functions of the brain and hippocampus is neuroproteomics. Mass spectrometry has been widely used to analyze biological samples, and has evolved into an indispensable tool for proteomics research. In this review, we present a general overview of the application of mass spectrometry in proteomics, summarize neuroproteomics and systems biology-based discovery of protein biomarkers for epilepsy, discuss the methodology needed to explore the epileptic hippocampus proteome, and also focus on applications of ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) in disease research. This neuroproteomics survey presents a framework for large-scale protein research in epilepsy that can be applied for immediate epileptic biomarker discovery and the far-reaching systems biology understanding of the protein regulatory networks. Ultimately, knowledge attained through neuroproteomics could lead to clinical diagnostics and therapeutics to lessen the burden of epilepsy on society. ? 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 29:197?246, 2010
