AB  - Summary.? Severe FXI deficiency is a rare injury-related bleeding disorder. In patients with FXI inhibitors, surgeries may be treated using recombinant activated factor VII; however, treatment safety is a major concern and the best dosing regimen as well as mode of administration is still to be defined. We describe four patients with severe factor XI deficiency and inhibitors to FXI, undergoing eight (four major) surgical procedures treated with continuous infusion of rFVIIa. Following acute MI that evolved after surgery of our first patient, all other patients were treated with low-dose bolus rFVIIa followed by low-dose continuous infusion of rFVIIa. Haemostasis was successfully achieved and no further thrombotic complications occurred. To support our clinical results ex-vivo thromboelastography studies were performed, demonstrating the differences of clot formation and lysis between patients with FXI deficiency and healthy controls and suggesting that low-dose rFVIIa corrects coagulation similarly to high-dose rFVIIa in FXI deficiency. Recombinant FVIIa at low doses may effectively induce haemostasis and seems to be a safe treatment mode in patients with FXI deficiency and inhibitors undergoing surgeries.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2010) 114, 1007?1018. Abstract Wallerian degeneration in peripheral nerves occurs after a traumatic insult when the distal nerve part degenerates while peripheral macrophages enter the nerve stump and remove the accruing debris by phagozytosis. We used an experimental model to investigate the effect of either the absence or over-expression of α-synuclein (α-syn) after transecting the sciatic nerves of mice. α-Synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies and its aggregation results in a premature destruction of nerve cells. It has also been found present in different peripheral nerves but its role in the axon remains still unclear. Following sciatic nerve transection in different mouse strains, we investigated the numbers of invading macrophages, the amounts of remaining myelin and axons 6?days after injury. All mice showed clear signs of Wallerian degeneration, but transgenic mice expressing human wild-type α-syn showed lower numbers of invading macrophages, less preserved myelin and significantly lower numbers of preserved axons in comparison with either knockout mice or a mouse strain with a spontaneous deletion of α-syn. The use of protein aggregation filtration blots and paraffin-embedded tissue blots displayed depositions of α-syn aggregates within sciatic nerve axons of transgenic mice. Thicker myelin sheaths and higher numbers of mitochondria were detected in old α-syn transgenic mice. In a human sural nerve, α-syn could also be identified within axons. Thus, α-syn and its aggregates are not only a component of Lewy bodies and synapses but also of axons and these aggregates might interfere with axonal transport. α-Synuclein transgenic mice represent an appropriate model for investigations on axonal transport in neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - SUMMARY Hemorrhage due to elective or emergency surgery results in significant patient morbidity and mortality and consumption of scarce transfusion resources. Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has been proposed as a universal hemostatic agent which may be beneficial in reducing blood loss and in treating unexpected massive hemorrhage in surgical patients. In elective surgery, a small number of randomized studies have shown a limited benefit for rFVIIa in the reduction of transfusion requirements. In massive hemorrhage associated with surgery, two case series and a growing number of case reports suggest that rFVIIa is successful as salvage therapy. However, a number of questions remain regarding the optimal dose, the true rate of thromboembolic complications and the overall survival and cost benefit when rFVIIa is used for this indication. In this review, the role of rFVIIa in managing blood loss in surgical patients is assessed in the light of current evidence.

AB  - Dentofacial defects can be small or very large, consisting of defects in the craniomaxillofacial region with missing soft tissue, bony and other hard tissue components. Such combined mucosal, osseous and even cartilaginous defects can be reconstructed using flaps and bone grafts, or hopefully, in the future with bone graft substitutes or even tissue engineered constructs. The healing of such wounds always relies on the vascularity of the surrounding tissues. This chapter seeks to provide a physiological basis for the mechanisms involved in the healing of such large complex defects. The reconstruction of specific defects must follow sound and logical surgical principles. The authors employ the concept of the reconstructive surgical ladder, in which techniques of step-wise increasing complexity are used with a strong preference for the simplest possible procedure at the outset. A number of techniques are presented along with the principles of tissue engineering and the basis for bone regeneration using adipose derived stem cells, growth factors and resorbable scaffolds.

AB  - Abstract Objective To examine the association between perioperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pediatric surgical patients. Methods Retrospective cohort study using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project Pediatric, a validated registry of 118 United States children's hospitals. Patients under 19 years of age undergoing a surgical procedure between 2012 and 2017 were included, with the main exposure being RBC transfusion in the perioperative period (48 hours prior to operation to 72 hours after operation). The primary 30-day outcome of interest was a postoperative VTE requiring therapy. Risk-adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were calculated using multiple logistic regression. Subgroup analyses were performed across multiple surgical specialties. Sensitivity analyses were performed after (a) imputation for missing variables and (b) propensity score matching. Results During the study years, 482 867 pediatric patients (56.7% male; median age, 6 years [interquartile range, 1?12 years]) underwent an operation. Of these, 30 879 (6.4%) received at least one perioperative RBC transfusion. Postoperative VTE requiring therapy occurred in 618 patients (0.13%). After adjustment for multiple risk factors, perioperative RBC transfusion was associated with an increased risk of VTE (aOR 2.4; 95% CI, 1.9?3.0). The increased VTE risk persisted after imputation of missing demographic and clinical data as well as after 1:1 propensity score matching (29 811 matched pairs, aOR 2.2; 95% CI, 1.7?2.8). Conclusions Perioperative RBC transfusion is associated with an increased, albeit still very low, risk of postoperative VTE in pediatric patients. Patients receiving blood in the perioperative period may benefit from additional monitoring or VTE prophylaxis.

AB  - The effects of total hepatectomy in a porcine model were studied. A portacaval shunt was constructed prior to hepatectomy, and the excised segment of inferior vena cava was replaced with a Dacron graft as soon as the liver had been removed. While the vena cava was clamped, venous return from the lower body to the heart was maintained using an extracorporeal veno-venous bypass system. The results of the study revealed that surprisingly few haemodynamic, biochemical or coagulation disturbances occur within the first 5 h following total hepatectomy in the pig, an animal with remarkably close anatomical and physiological similarities to man. In the anhepatic period which follows total hepatectomy during clinical liver transplantation, the situation is more complex, because pre-existing liver disease and portal hypertension, as well as major blood loss, often provide other reasons for metabolic and haemodynamic instability and coagulation disorders. The possible relevance of the findings in this large animal model to events that occur following total hepatectomy in the clinical situation is discussed.
