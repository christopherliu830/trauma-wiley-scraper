AB  - Abstract Background Liver biopsy is the gold standard to assess pathological features (eg inflammation grades) for hepatitis B virus-infected patients although it is invasive and traumatic; meanwhile, several gene profiles of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) have been separately described in relatively small hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected samples. We aimed to analyse correlations among inflammation grades, gene expressions and clinical parameters (serum alanine amino transaminase, aspartate amino transaminase and HBV-DNA) in large-scale CHB samples and to predict inflammation grades by using clinical parameters and/or gene expressions. Methods We analysed gene expressions with three clinical parameters in 122 CHB samples by an improved regression model. Principal component analysis and machine-learning methods including Random Forest, K-nearest neighbour and support vector machine were used for analysis and further diagnosis models. Six normal samples were conducted to validate the predictive model. Results Significant genes related to clinical parameters were found enriching in the immune system, interferon-stimulated, regulation of cytokine production, anti-apoptosis, and etc. A panel of these genes with clinical parameters can effectively predict binary classifications of inflammation grade (area under the ROC curve [AUC]: 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.77-0.93), validated by normal samples. A panel with only clinical parameters was also valuable (AUC: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65-0.86), indicating that liquid biopsy method for detecting the pathology of CHB is possible. Conclusions This is the first study to systematically elucidate the relationships among gene expressions, clinical parameters and pathological inflammation grades in CHB, and to build models predicting inflammation grades by gene expressions and/or clinical parameters as well.

AB  - Background.? The protein s100b indicates astrocytal damage as well as dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) is regarded as a marker for neuronal cell loss. Recently, s100b was shown to be a potentially useful marker for migraine in children. In this study, we investigated the levels of s100b and NSE in adult migraineurs during and after migraine attacks in order to gain some more insight into migraine pathophysiology. Methods.? Serum levels of s100b and NSE were measured in 21 migraineurs and compared with 21 healthy subjects matched by sex and age. In migraineurs, blood samples were taken during a migraine attack and following a pain-free period of 2-4 days. Results.? During migraine attacks elevated s100b levels could be observed. Maximal concentrations were detected in the pain-free period after 2-4 days. Regarding NSE, serum levels were decreased slightly during and after migraine bouts. Conclusions.? Our data suggest a prolonged disruption of BBB during and after migraine attacks. Other possible explanations concerning the detected serum levels of s100b and NSE will be discussed; however, neuronal cell death can be ruled out by the decreased serum concentrations of NSE. With regard to the results of the present study, further research is necessary to evaluate the role of s100b and NSE in migraine.

AB  - Abstract In a 28-year period, 39 (7%) patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (median age 66?years, 64% male) underwent a splenectomy at our institution. Primary indications for splenectomy were refractory thrombocytopenia (36%), progressive spleen related symptoms (33%), emergent splenectomy for splenic rupture (21%), refractory anemia (8%), and prior to allogeneic stem cell transplant (3%). Eleven (28%) patients had anemia at the time of splenectomy, of which 3 (27%) were autoimmune. The median time to splenectomy from CMML diagnosis was 6 months (0-40); perioperative morbidity and mortality rates were 43% and 13%, while the median postsplenectomy survival was 25?months (11-38). Durable remission in spleen related symptoms, thrombocytopenia, complications from splenic rupture, and anemia were achieved in 85%, 50%, 62%, and 21% of patients, respectively. Perioperative morbidity (n?=?30) included infections/sepsis in 6 (20%), intraabdominal bleeding in 4 (13%), venous thromboembolism (VTE) in 3 (10%), and acute lung injury in 2 (7%) patients. The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days (1-25), with 5 deaths occurring secondary to respiratory failure (n?=?2), multiorgan dysfunction (n?=?2) and hemorrhagic shock (n?=?1). There was no difference in overall survival between CMML patients that underwent splenectomy, in comparison to those that did not. Unlike in myelofibrosis, portal hypertension was not an indication for splenectomy and no patients developed post-splenectomy thrombocytosis. In conclusion, apart from being a lifesaving emergent modality in the event of splenic rupture, splenectomy has an important palliative role in patients with CMML, with significant and durable improvements in spleen related symptoms and refractory cytopenias.

PY  - 2018
AB  - Summary Horses suffer from a long list of diseases in which inflammation is central to the pathogenesis of the primary disease process. When the inflammatory response extends beyond the local injured tissues, widespread systemic inflammation ensues and can generate the clinical syndrome known as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The innate immune system is integral to the pathogenesis of the clinically recognized acute inflammatory disorders of SIRS, endotoxemia and sepsis syndromes. Coagulopathies are likely to exist in patients with moderate to severe systemic inflammation or endotoxemia, with variable clinicopathologic evidence of disordered hemostasis. Corticosteroids, theoretically, have many useful actions for fighting inflammation in endotoxemia, SIRS, and sepsis. Horses that recover from severe SIRS and sepsis are not necessarily at risk to have recurrent episodes of disease. However, inflammation-related end-organ damage might predispose them to organ failure or related complications in the future.

AB  - ABSTRACT Craniofacial (CF) tissue is an architecturally complex tissue consisting of both bone and soft tissues with significant patient specific variations. Conditions of congenital abnormalities, tumor resection surgeries, and traumatic injuries of the CF skeleton can result in major deficits of bone tissue. Despite advances in surgical reconstruction techniques, management of CF osseous deficits remains a challenge. Due its inherent versatility, bioprinting offers a promising solution to address these issues. In this review, we present and analyze the current state of bioprinting of bone tissue and highlight how these techniques may be adapted to serve regenerative therapies for CF applications.

AB  - Abstract Mitochondrial iron accumulation is thought to underlie the pathophysiology of Friedreich ataxia and may occur at the expense of cytosolic iron. Decreases in cytosolic iron induce expression of the transferrin receptor, some of which is released into the serum. Here, we demonstrate that serum transferrin receptor concentrations are increased in patients with Friedreich ataxia, which supports the hypothesis that it is a disease of abnormal intracellular iron distribution.

In this article, we demonstrate linkage between XMEA and markers on chromosome Xq28 and assign the XMEA gene locus to the most telomeric 10.5 cM of chromosome X. We also show that XVCM-MR is not allelic to XMEA. Ann Neurol 2000;47:666?669

AB  - Abstract Levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) in patients with Parkinson's disease are considered to result from the severity of dopaminergic denervation in the striatum, which is an irrevocable phenomenon, and sensitization induced by long-term intermittent administration of levodopa. Taking advantage of the 64% reduction of levodopa treatment allowed in 12 Parkinson's disease patients by continuous high-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus, we evaluated the severity of parkinsonian motor disability and LIDs during two levodopa challenges performed before the surgical implantation of the stimulation electrodes and after 8.8 months of continuous bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation that was interrupted 2 hours before the levodopa test. Motor disability during the ?off? and ?on? drug periods was unchanged. The severity of LIDs during the ?on? period and dystonia during the ?off? period decreased by 54% and 62%, respectively. The reduced severity of LIDs in the absence of subthalamic nucleus stimulation demonstrates that the sensitization phenomenon resulting from long-term intermittent levodopa administration is partially reversible.
