AB  - Abstract Extracellular vesicles (EV) are a heterogeneous collection of membrane-surrounded structures released from all studied cells, under both physiological and pathological conditions. These nano-size vesicles carry complex cargoes including different classes of proteins, lipids and nucleic acids and are known to act as a communication and signalling vesicles in various cellular process. In addition to their role in development and progression of pathological disorders which make them potentially great biomarkers, EV have beneficial effects, as they take part in homeostasis. In this review we have analysed the evidence for the role of microvesicles and exosomes secreted from other cells on microvascular endothelium (EV uptake) as well as the role of endothelial-derived vesicles on their neighbouring and distant cells (EV release).

AB  - Pulse contour analysis is a relatively new method of continuously monitoring cardiac output. The objective of this study was to evaluate the suitability of the human algorithm for calculation of continuous cardiac output from the pulse waveform, for use in anaesthetised horses. Cardiac output was measured in 27 anaesthetised clinical cases comparing lithium dilution (LiDCO) with a preceding, calibrated cardiac output measured from the pulse waveform (PulseCO) using a commercial system (LiDCOplus, LiDCO Ltd., Cambridge, UK). These comparisons were repeated every 20?30?min. Positive inotropes or vasopressors were administered when clinically indicated. Cardiac output values obtained ranged from 15.2?52.2?L/min, with cardiac indices from 30.7?114.9?ml/kg/min. Eighty-nine comparisons were obtained. The mean bias was 0.24?ml/kg/min +/?6.48?ml/kg/min. The limits of agreement were ?12.72?13.2?ml/kg/min. The 95% confidence interval for the upper limit of agreement was 12.07?14.33?ml/kg/min and for the lower limit of agreement was ?11.59?13.85?ml/kg/min. Linear regression analysis demonstrated a correlation coefficient (r2) of 0.89 and produced an equation of PulseCO (mls kg?1 minute?1)=0.9226LiDCO (mls kg?1minute?1) +5.354. This method of pulse contour analysis is a relatively non-invasive and reliable way of monitoring continuous cardiac output in the horse under anaesthesia. The ability to easily continuously monitor cardiac output may improve morbidity and mortality in the anaesthetised horse.

AB  - A 15-point neurological score for foals was developed, and tested on foals (<8 days old) presenting to the Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center (n=75) and the Royal Veterinary College (n=11). The score consists of 2 scales, which are added together to provide the total score. The points and descriptors for the first scale are as follows: Bright, alert, nursing, follows mare (0); Depressed, nursing, follows mare (1); Depressed, nursing, wanders away from mare (2); Depressed, standing, not nursing, will not follow mare (3); Recumbent, able to maintain sternal recumbency part of the time, strong suckle reflex (4); Recumbent, unable to maintain sternal recumbency, suckle reflex (5); Recumbent, no suckle reflex, responds to finger in ear (6); Recumbent, no suckle reflex, legs extended most of the time and muscles tense (7); Comatose, muscles relaxed, no response to finger in ear (8). Foals with a physical cause of recumbency (e.g., flexural deformity) are scored on this scale as if they were standing. The second scale is as follows: No seizure activity (0); Single seizure of less than 10 seconds (3); Single seizure of more than 10 seconds or two seizures of less then 10 seconds (4); Multiple seizures (5); Status epilepticus (7). All scores were assigned at admission by a single investigator. The median admission neurological scores for hospital survivors and non-survivors, and for blood culture positive and negative foals were compared with the Mann Whitney U-test. The correlation of admission neurological scores and arterial lactate concentrations (measured on a NOVA Stat profile M or CCX analyzer) and mean arterial pressure (measured indirectly with a tail cuff) was tested with Spearman's rho coefficient. Analysis of these data was performed using SPSS version 12. Results for all tests were considered significant if the p value was less than 0.05. The median neurological score on admission of all 86 foals was 4, and the range was from 0 to 12. The median score of survivors (2) was less than that of non-survivors (5) (p<0.001; n=86). There was no significant difference in median score between blood culture positive (4) and negative (3) foals (p=0.109; n=84). The neurological score was moderately correlated with admission lactate concentration (correlation coefficient 0.528, p<0.001, n=68), but only weakly correlated with mean arterial pressure (correlation coefficient ?0.285, p=0.011, n=78). This neurological score is statistically associated with clinically important parameters (hospital survival, blood lactate concentration), and warrants further study, including investigation of inter-observer variation in scoring.

AB  - Introduction: Mitral valve disease (MVD) is the most common acquired heart disease in dogs. When it results in congestive heart failure (CHF), MVD becomes an important cause of morbidity and mortality in dogs. Markers for determining the severity of cardiac injury and the heart's response to therapy might provide valuable information regarding the overall prognosis early in the course of CHF. This information might also provide a means for identifying those dogs with MVD that are at risk for CHF and those that might benefit from specific therapeutic interventions. In this study, we propose to investigate markers of cardiac myocyte injury in dogs that present in advanced (or Class IV) CHF due to MVD. Cardiac troponin I (CTnI) and cardiac troponin T (CTnT) are markers specific for cardiac myocyte damage, and serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP and pro-BNP), for myocyte stretch. These markers have shown predictive value in human and veterinary medicine, however further investigation is required. It is our hypothesis that one or more of these markers will be elevated at presentation compared to established laboratory normal values. Methods: Fifteen dogs that presented with Class IV CHF due to MVD based on physical examination findings, thoracic radiographs, and cardiac ultrasound had a blood sample drawn to measure serum levels of CTnT, CTnI and BNP, and pro-BNP at a commercial laboratory using immunoassays. Results: Our results show that 1 of 15 dogs had an elevated CTnT, 6 had an elevated CTnI, 0 had an elevated pro-BNP, and 3 had and elevated BNP level above laboratory normal values. Conclusions: There was no consistent elevation of CTnI, CTnT, BNP or pro-BNP in dogs with class IV CHF due to MR at time of presentation. Further studies need to be performed to evaluate these makers in dogs with CHF due to MR at varying intervals after admission to determine their potential benefits as markers of cardiac injury and response to therapy.

AB  - Abstract The lack of endogenous repair following spinal cord injury (SCI) accounts for the frequent permanent deficits for which effective treatments are absent. Previously, we demonstrated that low sulfated modified heparin mimetics (LS-mHeps) attenuate astrocytosis, suggesting they may represent a novel therapeutic approach. mHeps are glycomolecules with structural similarities to resident heparan sulfates (HS), which modulate cell signaling by both sequestering ligands, and acting as cofactors in the formation of ligand?receptor complexes. To explore whether mHeps can affect the myelination and neurite outgrowth necessary for repair after SCI, we created lesioned or demyelinated neural cell co-cultures and exposed them with a panel of mHeps with varying degrees and positions of their sulfate moieties. LS-mHep7 enhanced neurite outgrowth and myelination, whereas highly sulfated mHeps (HS-mHeps) had attenuating effects. LS-mHeps had no effects on myelination or neurite extension in developing, uninjured myelinating cultures, suggesting they might exert their proregenerating effects by modulating or sequestering inhibitory factors secreted after injury. To investigate this, we examined conditioned media from cultures using chemokine arrays and conducted an unbiased proteomics approach by applying TMT-LC/MS to mHep7 affinity purified conditioned media from these cultures. Multiple protein factors reported to play a role in damage or repair mechanisms were identified, including amyloid betaA4. Amyloid beta peptide (1?42) was validated as an important candidate by treating myelination cultures and shown to inhibit myelination. Thus, we propose that LS-mHeps exert multiple beneficial effects on mechanisms supporting enhanced repair, and represent novel candidates as therapeutics for CNS damage.

AB  - Summary This chapter deals with ?unusual? causes of ischemic stroke to highlight clues in the history, on examination and on imaging, which should serve as ?red flags? that something unusual may be underlying the patient's presenting symptoms. It divides the unusual causes of stroke into several subcategories including arterial injury; inflammatory vasculopathies and syndromes; congenital arteriopathies; hematological disorders; stroke as a result of systemic illnesses; genetic causes; and others. Cervical arterial dissections are considerably more common than intracranial dissections and their presentations are different enough that they should be considered separately. The most common vasculitis involving the brain is the temporal arteritic form of giant-cell arteritis (GCA), although it is fundamentally a systemic vasculitis. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) can present with focal neurologic deficits and so mimic ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or transient ischemic attack. A stroke is deemed cryptogenic if there are no evident direct cause or high-risk features for recurrence.
