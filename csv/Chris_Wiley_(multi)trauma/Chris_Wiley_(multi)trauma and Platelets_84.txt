AB  - Despite the rapid and proven efficacy of topical corticosteroids, side-effects can limit their clinical usefulness. Topically active macrolide immunosuppressants such as ascomycin and tacrolimus appear to provide comparable therapeutic potency without significant local or adverse effects. Data from ongoing studies will be crucial in determining the safety of these agents in the long term, and also their place within the current therapeutic armamentarium available for patients with atopic dermatitis. Enzyme inhibitors of PLA2 and PDE?4 currently in the very early stages of clinical development also show potential promise as additional alternative strategies to topical treatment and may perhaps act as steroid sparing agents. Having been in the therapeutic doldrums for years, topical management of atopic dermatitis is likely to show great changes in the very near future.

AB  - 1 Fresh rat aortic rings were incubated in HEPES-buffered salt solutions. Extracellular Ca2+ stimulated the production of prostacyclin (PGI2), as determined by radioimmunoassay of its stable hydrolysis product 6-oxo-prostaglandin F1α. This action of Ca2+ was modified by H+ over the pH range 8.0?6.5. Stimulation by calcium ionophore A23187 was not pH-dependent. 2 In parallel incubations of aortic rings with 45 Ca2+, followed by washing in the presence of La3+, tissue uptake of 45Ca2+ increased progressively as extracellular pH was increased from 6.5?8.0. Over this range intracellular pH, estimated by the distribution of [14C]-dimethadione, varied from 5.9-7.4. 3 Stimulation by Ca2+ of PGI2 synthesis was concentration-dependent over the range 0.7?20 mm. The maximum effect was an increase of approx. 4 fold. 4 Nifedipine, but not verapamil or diltiazem, inhibited Ca2+-stimulated PGI2 synthesis. A dihydropyridine compound that activates voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, Bay K 8644, did not increase PGI2 synthesis. 5 8-(N, N-diethylamino)-octyl-3,4,5 timethoxybenzoate (TMB-8), an antagonist of intracellular Ca2+ mobilisation, inhibited basal and Ca2+-stimulated PGI2 synthesis to a similar extent. 6 A solution containing 40 mm K+ reduced Ca2+-stimulated PGI2 production. Mg2+ stimulated PGI2 synthesis in a pH-dependent manner but was less potent than Ca2+. Other divalent cations (Mn2+, Ba2+ and Sr2+), and La3+ had little or no effect on basal or Ca2+-stimulated PGI2 synthesis.

AB  - Summary Understanding the complex immunological consequences of red cell transfusion is essential if we are to use this valuable resource wisely and safely. The decision to transfuse red cells should be made after serious considerations of the associated risks and benefits. Immunological risks of transfusion include major incompatibility reactions and transfusion-related acute lung injury, while other immunological insults such as transfusion-related immunomodulation are relatively underappreciated. Red cell transfusions should be acknowledged as immunological exposures, with consequences weighed against expected benefits. This article reviews immunological consequences and the emerging evidence that may inform risk-benefit considerations in clinical practice.

AB  - ABSTRACT The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) Journal of Clinical Apheresis (JCA) Special Issue Writing Committee is charged with reviewing, updating and categorizing indications for the evidence-based use of therapeutic apheresis (TA) in human disease. Since the 2007 JCA Special Issue (Fourth Edition), the committee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approaches in the grading and categorization of apheresis indications. This Eighth Edition of the JCA Special Issue continues to maintain this methodology and rigor in order to make recommendations on the use of apheresis in a wide variety of diseases/conditions. The JCA Eighth Edition, like its predecessor, continues to apply the category and grading system definitions in fact sheets. The general layout and concept of a fact sheet that was introduced in the Fourth Edition, has largely been maintained in this edition. Each fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of TA in a specific disease entity or medical condition. The Eighth Edition comprises 84 fact sheets for relevant diseases and medical conditions, with 157 graded and categorized indications and/or TA modalities. The Eighth Edition of the JCA Special Issue seeks to continue to serve as a key resource that guides the utilization of TA in the treatment of human disease.

AB  - Although the physiological role of beta2-glycoprotein I (B2GPI) is unknown, in vitro evidence indicates that B2GPI may be a natural anticoagulant. In this study we have examined whether fluctuations of plasma B2GPI occur in in vivo coagulation. Serial measurements of B2GPI and other anticoagulant proteins were performed in 51 patients with thrombotic (group 1: six patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), group 2: venous (n=4) or arterial (n=17) thrombosis) and non-thrombotic disease (group 3: 24 patients undergoing elective surgery). Reductions in plasma B2GPI levels were seen in most patients which were roughly proportional to the severity of their illness. Particularly striking reductions of B2GPI, protein C (PC) and antithrombin III (AT-III) (mean ±?95% CI: 42.7?±?8.6%, 42.1?±?14.8%, 39.1?±?28.4% respectively) were seen in group 1. The reductions in plasma B2GPI were significantly greater in group 1 than in the other groups. Dilutional factors explain most of the reductions in B2GPI, PC and AT-III in groups 2 and 3, but contribute little to group 1. In conclusion, although B2GPI behaves as a ?negative acute phase reactant?, the magnitude of reduction of plasma B2GPI levels, accompanied by reductions in other anticoagulant proteins in patients with DIC, suggests specific consumption of B2GPI in in vivo coagulation. This study provides further evidence that B2GPI is an anticoagulant of physiological importance.
