AB  - SUMMARY Objectives This study was conducted to assess transfusion knowledge between different specialty board residents and to identify areas of need for further education. Background Physicians' knowledge of transfusion medicine (TM) is critical for patients' safety. Many clinicians who are involved in day-to-day transfusion practice have little or no formal training in TM. There are no studies to assess physician's TM knowledge locally. Methods A comprehensive anonymous survey was developed to assess baseline TM knowledge of all the residents. The survey is composed of different sections, including a questionnaire on resident's demographics, resident's self-reflection on their TM knowledge and 30 multiple choice questions addressing basic and clinical TM knowledge in two major domains: component selection and transfusion practice and transfusion safety and transfusion reactions. Finally, the residents' opinion on educational needs was assessed. Results A total of 130 residents were surveyed. The lowest score obtained among the two major domains assessed was in the transfusion safety and transfusion reaction domain, with a mean score of 4·34 of 15 (SD ± 3·27). The mean score obtained on component selection and transfusion practice was 7·1 of 15 (SD ± 3·74). A substantial proportion of the residents (74·7%) admitted minimal baseline knowledge in the field of TM. Finally, 94·5% of the residents admitted the need for more education during residency, whereas 49·5% thought additional education is required during the first year of practice. Conclusion This survey shows serious TM knowledge deficiency and indicates the need for additional education among all physicians during training.

AB  - Objective To assess the use of local haemostatic agents (HAs) in a prospective multicentre large series of partial nephrectomies (PNs). Patients and Methods Prospective National Observational Registry on the Practices of Haemostasis in Partial Nephrectomy (NEPHRON): the study was conducted in 54 French urological centres from 1 June to 31 December 2010. In all, 570 consecutive patients undergoing a PN were enrolled in this study in a prospective manner. The data was collected prospectively via an electronic case-report form: five different sheets were included for preoperative, perioperative, postoperative and follow-up data respectively. Information related to haemostasis was analysed. Results The median patient age was 60 years and the mean (range) tumour size was 3.68 (0.19?15) cm. An HA was primarily used in 71.4% of patients, with a statistically significant difference among surgical approaches (P = 0.024). In 91.8% of cases, a single use of a HA was sufficient for achieving haemostasis. The HA was used either alone (13.9%) or in association with sutures (80.3%). One or more additional haemostatic action(s) was needed in 12.3% of the cases. When comparing patients who received a HA with those who did not receive a HA, there was no statistical difference between the groups for tumour size (P = 0.542), collecting system drainage (P = 0.538), hospital stay (P = 0.508), operation time (P = 0.169), blood loss (P = 0.387) or transfusion rate (P = 0.713). Conclusion HAs are widely used by urologists during PN. Progress is needed for standardising HA application, especially for the timing of application. For the time being, the role of the HA in nephron-sparing surgery is still to be evaluated.

Additionally, a summary of pheochromocytoma and the idiosyncrasies of perioperative management of a pheochromocytoma are provided. Summary: A 7-year old male, neutered, Dalmation was presented for acute collapse, abdominal pain and tachycardia. Physical examination findings were consistent with hypoperfusion concurrent with multiple cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension. Abdominal ultrasound revealed retroperitoneal effusion and a right adrenal mass intimately associated with the caudal vena cava. Incomplete right adrenalectomy was performed. Histopathology confirmed a pheochromocytoma. Unique information provided: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first definitive report of acute retroperitoneal hemorrhage as the initial clinical manifestation of histologically confirmed adrenal pheochromocytoma in the dog.

AB  - ABSTRACT Serotonin syndrome is an iatrogenic disorder induced by pharmacologic treatment with serotonergic agents that increases serotonin activity. In addition, there is a wide variety of clinical disorders associated with serotonin excess. The frequent concurrent use of serotonergic and neuroleptic drugs and similarities between serotonin syndrome and neuroleptic malignant syndrome can present the clinician with a diagnostic challenge. In this article, we review the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of serotonin syndrome as well as other serotonergic disorders.

AB  - Abstract The term ?catastrophic? antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) is defined as an accelerated form of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) usually resulting in multiorgan failure. These patients have in common: (i) clinical evidence of multiple organ involvement developing in a very short time period; (ii) histopathological evidence of multiple small vessel occlusions (a minority also have large vessel thrombosis); and (iii) laboratory confirmation of the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), usually in high titres. Although less than 1% of patients with the APS develop this complication, its potentially lethal outcome emphasizes its importance in clinical medicine.

AB  - Abstract Musculoskeletal diseases are one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Among them, tendon and ligament injuries represent an important aspect to consider in both athletes and active working people. Tendon and ligament damage is an important cause of joint instability, and progresses into early onset of osteoarthritis, pain, disability and eventually the need for joint replacement surgery. The social and economical burden associated with these medical conditions presents a compelling argument for greater understanding and expanding research on this issue. The particular physiology of tendons and ligaments (avascular, hypocellular and overall structural mechanical features) makes it difficult for currently available treatments to reach a complete and long-term functional repair of the damaged tissue, especially when complete tear occurs. Despite the effort, the treatment modalities for tendon and ligament are suboptimal, which have led to the development of alternative therapies, such as the delivery of growth factors, development of engineered scaffolds or the application of stem cells, which have been approached in this review.
