AB  - Abstract: In toxicology studies, drug-induced arterial injury in laboratory animals continues to be a pressing issue of concern, particularly to those engaged in the discovery and development of novel therapies intended for human use. The concern is justifiably magnified because, currently, there is no unequivocal biochemical marker of arterial injury and/or toxicity in animals or man. Therefore, in laboratory animals used for toxicology studies a precise description of arterial lesions in terms of location, distribution and morphologic character is necessary so that a correlation can be drawn between structural damage and derangement of specific cardiovascular functions. The critical nature of the latter cannot be over-emphasized because this will provide a basis for understanding the mechanism of toxicity, the pathogenesis of the lesion and assessment of human risk. However, in the decision making process, utilization of pattern recognition must be supported by rigorous scientific investigations aimed at establishing a link, where possible, between the deranged cardiovascular function and alterations in cellular, biochemical and molecular events. Conceivably, engagement of the molecular pharmacology target initiates a series of interactive cascades among cellular and non-cellular arterial components that culminate in organ damage. Therefore, any investigative mechanistic studies aimed at understanding the initiation and development of arterial lesions in laboratory animals must make a conscientious attempt to identify and characterize the molecular target of toxicity.

AB  - Abstract Musculoskeletal diseases are one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Among them, tendon and ligament injuries represent an important aspect to consider in both athletes and active working people. Tendon and ligament damage is an important cause of joint instability, and progresses into early onset of osteoarthritis, pain, disability and eventually the need for joint replacement surgery. The social and economical burden associated with these medical conditions presents a compelling argument for greater understanding and expanding research on this issue. The particular physiology of tendons and ligaments (avascular, hypocellular and overall structural mechanical features) makes it difficult for currently available treatments to reach a complete and long-term functional repair of the damaged tissue, especially when complete tear occurs. Despite the effort, the treatment modalities for tendon and ligament are suboptimal, which have led to the development of alternative therapies, such as the delivery of growth factors, development of engineered scaffolds or the application of stem cells, which have been approached in this review.

AB  - Summary This chapter introduces the foundations of transfusion medicine and the principles behind donor selection, product collection, compatibility testing, transfusion administration, recognition and treatment of transfusion-related reactions, and alternative methods of blood product use. Canine blood types are classified using the dog erythrocyte antigen (DEA) system. Commercially available blood typing kits have made in-house blood type determination possible in both dogs and cats. Cross-matching does not indicate if the donor and the recipient have the same blood type. Canine donors should be young and in good overall health and behavioral standing determined by clinical history and physical exam. Fresh whole blood is utilized for a variety of reasons within veterinary medicine, including replacement therapy in patients who have decreased oxygen-carrying capacity with hypovolemia to a significant degree. A variety of transfusion sets and filters are available for use in veterinary transfusion medicine. Immunological reactions are caused by antigen-antibody interactions between the donor and recipient.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The transfusion of old red cells (RBCs) may be associated with reduced delivery of oxygen to tissues and an increased risk of transfusion complications. The association of postoperative morbidity with the length of storage of perioperatively transfused RBCs was studied in 268 consecutive patients receiving a blood transfusion for coronary artery bypass graft surgery. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The postoperative length of hospitalization, the postoperative length of stay in the intensive care unit, and the length of endotracheal intubation after the day of the operation were used as surrogate measures of global postoperative morbidity. The length of storage of the oldest transfused RBC unit, the mean length of storage of the oldest and second oldest RBC units, and the mean length of storage of all RBC units transfused to each patient were tested for association with the three outcome variables. Multiple linear regression analysis and Cox proportional-hazard analysis were used to adjust for the effects of confounding factors that pertained to each patient's severity of illness and the difficulty of each operation. RESULTS: There were no significant associations after adjustment for the effects of confounding factors. CONCLUSION: This study did not corroborate the previously reported association between transfusion of old RBCs and increased morbidity. However, there is surprisingly little research on the clinical outcomes of the transfusions of old RBCs, and this hypothesis should be investigated further.
