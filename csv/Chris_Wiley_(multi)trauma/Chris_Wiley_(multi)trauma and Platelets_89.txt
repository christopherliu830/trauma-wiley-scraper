AB  - Abstract The incidence of hypoxic liver injury, most commonly referred to as hypoxic hepatitis (HH), is up to 10% in critically ill patients. In the majority of cases, HH occurs as a consequence of haemodynamic impairment following cardiogenic or septic shock. A marked, dramatic increase in the aminotransferase levels in a setting of cardiocirculatory failure is the key characteristic of HH. HH may contribute to several complications such as hepatopulmonary syndrome and hypoglycaemia. The overall mortality after the onset of HH is approximately 50?60% within 1 month. We report a case of severe HH that was successfully bridged using the Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System. In addition to the possible effects of extracorporeal liver support devices, the recognition of HH and therapy of the underlying disease that led to the occurrence of HH is of central importance.

AB  - Background and Objectives Spontaneous rupture of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (srHCC) is a life-threatening emergency. We sought to identify the pre-operative predictors of early tumor recurrence/mortality including the role of inflammatory indices after partial hepatectomy for srHCC. Methods Between 2000-2015, 79 patients with srHCC were identified to have undergone upfront partial hepatectomy following srHCC. Clinicopathologic data were retrospectively analyzed to identify pre-operative predictors of early (<1 year) recurrence and mortality. Results Seventy-nine patients were identified to have undergone partial hepatectomy for srHCC. The 1-year mortality and 1-year recurrence rate in our series was 30.3% and 41.8% respectively. On multivariate analyses, free tumor rupture and a tumor size?>?10?cm were identified to be independent predictors of early recurrence while an alpha fetoprotein (AFP)?>?200?ng/mL was an independent predictor of early mortality. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio?>?3 and prognostic nutritional index?<?40 were predictors of early recurrence while PLR?>?180 was a predictor of early mortality on univariate analyses but not multivariate analyses. Conclusions Tumor size?>?10?cm, free tumor rupture, and an AFP?>?200?ng/mL were useful predictors in avoiding ?futile surgery? in patients with srHCC undergoing a partial hepatectomy. Preoperative inflammatory markers appear to be less useful as predictors of early recurrence/mortality in this cohort of patients.

AB  - Abstract Aim The objective of the present review was to answer the focused question: what is the effect of cell therapy in terms of orofacial bone regeneration compared to grafting with only biomaterial scaffolds and/or autogenous bone? Methods Electronic databases were searched for relevant controlled clinical and pre-clinical (large-animal) studies. Separate meta-analyses of quantitative data regarding histological or radiographic new bone formation were performed. Results Forty-seven eligible clinical and 57 pre-clinical studies were included. Clinical studies were categorized based on the use of ?minimally manipulated? whole tissues (e.g., bone marrow) or ex vivo expanded cells from ?uncommitted? (bone marrow, adipose tissue) or ?committed? sources (periosteum, bone). Based on limited and heterogeneous clinical evidence, implantation of cells (mostly whole bone marrow), in combination with biomaterial scaffolds results in bone regeneration which is (a) superior compared to implantation of scaffolds alone in sinus and horizontal ridge augmentation, and (b) comparable to autogenous bone in alveolar cleft repair. Conclusions Although current evidence points to the benefits of cell therapy in certain clinical indications, it is unclear whether the use of ex vivo expanded cells, either uncommitted or committed, is superior to whole tissue fractions in terms of bone regeneration. The relatively larger effect sizes in favour of cell therapy observed in pre-clinical studies are diminished in clinical trials. Future controlled studies should include cost-effectiveness analyses to guide clinical decision-making.

AB  - Objective:? To investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the calmodulin1 (CALM1) and estrogen receptor-α genes correlate with double curve in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Methods:? A total of 67 Chinese patients with AIS with double curve and 100 healthy controls were recruited. Curve pattern and Cobb angle of each patient were recorded. The Cobb angle is at least 30°. There were 60 patients with Cobb angle ≥ 40°. According to the apical location of the major curve, there were 40 thoracic curve patients. Four polymorphic loci, including rs12885713 (?16C > T) and rs5871 in the CALM1 gene and rs2234693 (Pvu II) and rs9340799 (Xba I) in the estrogen receptor 1 (ER1) gene were analyzed by the ABI3730 genetic analyzer. Results:? The current study indicates that: (i) there are statistical differences between patients with double curve, with Cobb angle ≥ 40° and with thoracic curve and healthy controls in the polymorphic distribution of the rs2234693 site of the ER1 gene, (P= 0.014, 0.0128, 0.0184 respectively); (ii) there is a difference between patients with double curve and controls in the polymorphic distribution of the rs12885713 site in the CALM1 gene (P= 0.034); and (iii) there is a difference between thoracic curve patients and controls in the polymorphic distribution of the rs5871 site in the CALM1 gene (P= 0.0102). Conclusions:? Different subtypes of AIS might be related to different SNP. A combination of CALM1 and ER1 gene polymorphisms might be related to double curve in patients with AIS. Further study is necessary to confirm these hypotheses.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To determine the frequency and independent predictors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in addition to the prognostic implications of both AKI and periprocedural red blood cell (RBC) transfusions on 30 day and cumulative late mortality in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Background: RBC transfusions have been reported to predict AKI following TAVI. Data on the prognostic implications of both factors, however, are lacking. Methods: 126 consecutive patients underwent TAVI with the Medtronic CoreValve Revalving System. AKI was defined according to the valve academic research consortium definitions as an absolute increase in serum creatinine ≥0.3 mg dL?1 (≥26.4 ?mol L?1) or a percentage increase ≥50% within 72 hr following TAVI. Results: Five patients on chronic haemodialysis and three intraprocedural deaths were excluded, leading to a final study population of 118 patients. AKI occurred in 19% of the patients necessitating temporary haemodialysis in 2%. Independent predictors of AKI included: previous myocardial infarction (OR: 5.72; 95% CI: 1.64?19.94), periprocedural (<24 hr) RBC transfusions (OR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.01?1.70), postprocedural (<72 hr) leucocyte count (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.02?1.37), and logistic EuroSCORE (OR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.01?1.14). In patients with AKI, 30-day mortality was 23% and cumulative late mortality (median: 13 months) was 55%. AKI (OR: 5.47; 95% CI: 1.23?24.21) and postprocedural leucocyte count (OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.03?1.38) were independent predictors of 30-day mortality while AKI (HR: 2.79; 95% CI: 1.36?5.71) was the only independent predictor of late mortality. Conclusions: AKI following TAVI occurred in 19% of the patients. RBC transfusion was found to be an independent predictor of AKI, which in turn predicted both 30-day and cumulative late mortality. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Major hepatic resection is now performed frequently and with relative safety, but is accompanied by significant pathophysiological changes. The aim of this review is to describe these changes along with interventions that may help reduce the risk for adverse outcomes after major hepatic resection. Methods The MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were searched for relevant literature published from January 2000 to December 2011. Broad subject headings were ?hepatectomy/?, ?liver function/?, ?liver failure/? and ?physiology/?. Results Predictable changes in blood biochemistry and coagulation occur following major hepatic resection and alterations from the expected path indicate a complicated course. Susceptibility to sepsis, functional renal impairment, and altered energy metabolism are important sequelae of post-resection liver failure. Conclusions The pathophysiology of post-resection liver failure is difficult to reverse and thus strategies aimed at prevention are key to reducing morbidity and mortality after liver surgery.

AB  - Abstract Purpose and basic procedure of the study:? The availability of new targeted therapies has revolutionised the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), for both the newly diagnosed and the relapsed and refractory settings. A panel of Italian experts provided guidelines for optimal clinical practice in the treatment of MM. Main findings and conclusions:? The panel recommended that treatment should only be initiated in symptomatic patients. Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) with melphalan is the treatment of choice in patients younger than 65?yr, and induction therapy including new drugs seems the most suitable preparatory regimen before ASCT. In patients who fail to achieve at least a very good partial response (VGPR) after transplant, a consolidation with a second transplant is of clinical benefit. Also, there is evidence that maintenance with thalidomide after ASCT in young patients failing to reach at least VGPR could prolong survival. In elderly patients, the combination of an alkylating drug with a novel agent should be considered as standard approach. Relapsed MM should be retreated after the reappearance of symptoms and signs of organ and tissue damage. Salvage regimens should include corticosteroids plus bortezomib, thalidomide or lenalidomide.
