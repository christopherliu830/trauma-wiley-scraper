AB  - Purpose? TRD is an uncommon but serious consequence of blunt trauma. It is often associated with other life threatening injuries and its diagnosis is challenging. Limited information exists on outcomes following rupture, although there are increasing reports of late recurrent herniation. Our aim was to document the outcome of TRD initially and at intermediate term follow up (up to five years). Methodology? A review of all patients suffering TRD, over the past five years, at The Alfred Hospital was performed. Injury severity score (ISS), associated injuries, diagnosis- early versus late and imaging modality used, and surgical repair technique were recorded. All patients were followed up with a questionnaire, regarding symptoms of recurrence and chest X-ray (CXR). Results? 33 patients (18 female, 15 male; mean age 36?yrs, mean ISS 42) were included. All injury mechanisms were high energy (motor vehicle occupants 27, pedestrians 5, horse rider 1); 25 sustained other intra-abdominal injuries. There were nine early and no late deaths. CXR was diagnostic in 14 cases, with 23 recognised early (pre-operatively). 6 were diagnosed intra-operatively (5 for instability, 1 following unremarkable imaging). 3 late diagnoses (>24 hours after presentation) occurred, with 1 at 6 months post injury. Emergent primary repair was undertaken using non-absorbable sutures, although in three cases absorbable sutures were used. Conclusions? TRD is associated with high energy blunt force and severe multi-system injury. We advocate emergent primary repair with non-absorbable suture and advise a minimum five year follow-up.

AB  - SUMMARY When IAT is used, the patient's shed blood is collected continuously from the wound site during surgery. The salvaged red cells are stored in a dedicated reservoir and subsequently processed by cell separation (continuous centrifugation), washed with saline, concentrated and retransfused to the patient. In the context of perioperative blood saving strategies, IAT has gained standard-of-care status in many surgical procedures as it is especially cost-effective when the anticipated intraoperative blood loss is likely to exceed 1000 mL (major orthopedic, cardiac, vascular and emergency trauma surgery). IAT is not primarily recommended for cancer surgery or whenever the operative field is contaminated. Intraoperative plasmapheresis (IP) is used in cardiac surgery to minimize coagulation deficiencies caused by the traumatizing effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on platelets. A substantial amount of the patient's circulating platelets is withdrawn prior to heparinization and initiation of CPB. The collected autologous platelet-rich plasma is then stored at room temperature, preserving platelet function and plasmatic coagulation factors, and retransfused to the patient after heparin reversal. There is controversy about the actual blood saving benefit of IP, but this method may be effective in complicated procedures precipitating high blood loss and long CPB times. In addition, IP may be used when other autologous whole blood harvesting techniques are not an option.

AB  - Abstract This chapter reviews psychological trauma from a multilevel developmental psychopathology. This perspective holds that no single approach or discipline adequately encompasses the phenomenon of psychological trauma and how it interacts with development in terms of its impact on the individual. Rather, multiple levels are preferable, including the areas of neurobiology, psychology, psychopathology, and psychiatric diagnosis, individual, familial, societal, cultural, economic, and physical. To address all of these levels, an interdisciplinary team approach is required, with individuals who have expertise in as wide a range of fields as psychology, psychiatry, neurobiology, immunology, genetics, cardiology, internal medicine, statistics, radiology, physics, computer science, psychopharmacology, child development, philosophy and literature. The implication is that no single individual or specialty will have sufficient expertise and knowledge in enough areas to provide an appropriate characterization of the effects of trauma on the individual. Additionally, all of these areas will interact with developmental epoch in different ways. Use of the multilevel developmental psychopathology approach has the promise of being more helpful to individuals affected by psychological trauma.

AB  - Abstract Objective The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility, safety and initial efficacy of paclitaxel administration using a novel drug delivery catheter for the prevention of restenosis in infrapopliteal de novo and restenotic lesions. Background Restenosis continues to be a great challenge after percutaneous revascularization procedures for peripheral arterial disease, particularly for below-the-knee applications. Methods A prospective, multicenter first-in-human registry of a novel delivery catheter delivering liquid paclitaxel was conducted in 10 patients. The primary efficacy endpoint at 6 months was freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) and the primary safety endpoint at 1, 3, and 6 months were thrombosis, major amputation in the target limb and target limb related death. Results All patients tolerated the procedure well with no reports of adverse procedural events. Twelve (n?=?12) lesions in ten patients were treated with a mean lesion length of 83.3?±?49.2 mm, with the lesion length range of 30mm to 182 mm. At 6-month follow-up, the rate of CD-TLR was 30% (3 of 10 patients). Zero patients (0 out of 10) demonstrated thrombosis, major amputation in the target limb and target limb related death at the 1, 3, and 6 month follow-up intervals. Conclusions This first in-human experience obtained in a multicenter study of real-world de novo and restenotic lesions demonstrates a favorable safety and efficacy profile at 6 months. Randomized comparison to current drug coated balloons should be performed to further validate this approach and positive experience.

Methods and results Randomized, controlled, multi-center prospective clinical trial with randomization 2:1 in favor of the OFFII. Primary efficacy endpoint was the rate of successful device placement and defect closure without major complications at hospital discharge. All data were assessed through a core laboratory. Interim analysis was performed when 70% of the patients were treated to evaluate for noninferiority. From a total of 176 randomized subjects, interim analysis was performed on the first 158 patients (65.2% female) (107 OFFII/51 ASO) undergoing device closure at a median weight of 42?kg (range 13-125?kg). Seventy-six percent (120 patients) completed 6-month follow-up. Successful device placement (first attempt) was achieved in 99.1% of the OFF group vs 90.2% of the ASO group (P?<?0.05). Early efficacy success was achieved in 94.4% of the OFFII group vs 90.2% of the ASO group (P?<?0.001). The incidence of major complications was 5.6% for the OFFII group compared to 9.8% for the ASO. Conclusions The OFFII device was not inferior to the ASO with less complications and greater efficacy than the ASO.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) play a pivotal role in modern therapeutic approaches in bone-healing disorders. Although bone marrow-derived MSCs are most frequently used, the knowledge that many other adult tissues represent promising sources for potent MSCs has gained acceptance. In the present study, the osteogenic differentiation potential of porcine skin fibroblasts (FBs), as well as bone marrow- (BMSCs), adipose tissue- (ASCs) and dental pulp-derived stromal cells (DSCs) were evaluated. However, additional application of BMP-2 significantly elevated the delayed osteogenic differentiation capacity of ASC and FB cultures, and in DSC cultures the supplementation of platelet-rich plasma increased osteogenic differentiation potential to a comparable level of the good differentiable BMSCs. Furthermore, microarray gene expression performed in an exemplary manner for ASCs and BMSCs revealed that ASCs and BMSCs use different gene expression patterns for osteogenic differentiation under standard media conditions, as diverse MSCs are imprinted dependent from their tissue niche. However, after increasing the differentiation potential of ASCs to a comparable level as shown in BMSCs, a small subset of identical key molecules was used to differentiate in the osteogenic lineage. Until now, the importance of identified genes seems to be underestimated for osteogenic differentiation. Apparently, the regulation of transmembrane protein 229A, interleukin-33 and the fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 in the early phase of osteogenic differentiation is needed for optimum results. Based on these results, bone regeneration strategies of MSCs have to be adjusted, and in vivo studies on the osteogenic capacities of the different types of MCSs are warranted.

AB  - The aim of this study was to prove the effectiveness of MatriDerm? combined with skin grafting versus skin grafting alone in post-traumatic wounds treatment. At the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, we treated 60 patients: 30 patients with dermal substitutes (MatriDerm?) combined with autologous skin graft and 30 with skin graft alone. Two weeks after the first treatment, 95% of wounds treated with MatriDerm? and skin graft showed a re-epithelisation, whereas it was 75?80% in the control group. We used the Manchester Scar Scale (MSS) and patient's self-estimation scale to assess the outcomes. Mann?Whitney U test was performed for the five items of the MSS and the results were combined to those of patient's self-estimation scale and the re-epithelialisation percentage to test the significance between the two groups. These data confirm the evidence of the clinical use of MatriDerm? technology in the healing of soft tissue wounds and prove the effectiveness of combining MatriDerm? and skin grafting for the first time. Furthermore, we observed a percentage reduction of wound contraction and in the same time an improvement of elasticity, quality of scars tissue and dermal architecture.

AB  - Essentials The lectin pathway's MASP-1/2 activates coagulation factors but the trigger of the activation is unknown. MASP-1/2 activation was assessed by quantifying complexes between MASPs and antithrombin/C1-inhibitor. Activated platelets and fibrin were demonstrated to activate MASP-1 and MASP-2 both in vitro and in vivo. These findings may represent a crossroad between the complement and the coagulation systems. Summary Background The activated forms of the complement lectin pathway (LP) proteases MASP-1 and MASP-2 are able to cleave the coagulation factors prothrombin, fibrinogen, factor XIII and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor in vitro. In vivo studies also show that MASP-1 is involved in thrombogenesis. Objectives To clarify the not yet identified mechanisms involved in triggering activation of the LP during thrombotic reactions. Methods Novel sandwich-ELISAs for detection of complexes between MASP-1 or MASP-2 and the serpins C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) or antithrombin (AT), were used to specifically detect and quantify the activated forms of MASP-1 and MASP-2. Results Activated platelets were shown by flow cytometry to bind Ficolin-1, -2 and -3 but not MBL, which was associated with activation of MASP-1 and MASP-2. We also demonstrated that fibrin and the plasmin-generated fibrin fragment DD in plasma, bind and activate MASP-1 and MASP-2. As demonstrated by the ELISA and SDS-PAGE/Western blotting, the fibrin-associated activation was reflected in a specific inactivation by AT during clotting without the assistance of heparin. In all other cases the MASPs were, as previously reported, inactivated by C1-INH. In systemic lupus erythematosus patients with thrombotic disease and in polytrauma patients, the levels of activated MASP-1 and MASP-2 in complex with both AT and C1-INH were associated with markers of thrombotic disease and contact/coagulation system activation. Conclusions MASP-1 and MASP-2 are activated during blood clotting. This activation is triggered by activated platelets and by the generation of fibrin during thrombotic reactions in vitro and in vivo, and may represent a novel activation/amplification mechanism in thromboinflammation.

AB  - Summary Massive haemorrhage is a life-threatening emergency affecting many patient groups. 5?30% of critically ill patients with major blood loss have an accompanying coagulopathy, and this confers a poor prognosis. Successful treatment of severe bleeding is dependent upon many factors, including early identification of any at-risk patient, recognition and treatment of any accompanying coagulopathy, and the proactive delivery of red blood cells (RBC), to maintain tissue oxygenation, and blood components (FFP, platelets), to target the coagulopathy. This chapter will summarize the general haemostatic changes that occur during major blood loss and detail how this information has helped to drive recent changes to transfusion practices. It will focus on the general management of major blood loss and discuss how this may vary according to the different clinical settings.

AB  - Background and Objectives There is currently intense multidisciplinary interest and a maturing body of literature regarding laser treatments for traumatic scars, but international treatment guidelines and reimbursement schemes have not yet caught up with current knowledge and practice in many centers. The authors intend to highlight the tremendous potential of laser techniques, offer recommendations for safe and efficacious treatment, and promote wider patient access guided by future high-quality research. Study Design/Materials and Methods An international panel of 26 dermatologists and plastic and reconstructive surgeons from 13 different countries and a variety of practice backgrounds was self-assembled to develop updated consensus recommendations for the laser treatment of traumatic scars. A three-step modified Delphi method took place between March 2018 and March 2019 consisting of two rounds of emailed questionnaires and supplementary face-to-face meetings. The panel members approved the final manuscript via email correspondence, and the threshold for consensus was at least 80% concurrence among the panel members. Results The manuscript includes extensive detailed discussion regarding a variety of laser platforms commonly used for traumatic scar management such as vascular lasers and ablative and non-ablative fractional lasers, special considerations such as coding and laser treatments in skin of color, and 25 summary consensus recommendations. Conclusions Lasers are a first-line therapy in the management of traumatic scars and contractures, and patients without access to these treatments may not be receiving the best available care after injury. Updated international treatment guidelines and reimbursement schemes, additional high-quality research, and patient access should reflect this status. Lasers Surg. Med. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Massive transfusion (MTP) protocol design is hindered by lack of accurate assessment of coagulation. Rapid thrombelastography (r-TEG) provides point-of-care (POC) analysis of clot formation. We designed a prospective study to test the hypothesis that integrating TEG into our MTP would facilitate goal-directed therapy and provide equivalent outcomes compared to conventional coagulation testing. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Thiry-four patients who received more than 6 units of red blood cells (RBCs)/6 hours who were admitted to our Level 1 trauma center after r-TEG implementation (TEG) were compared to 34 patients admitted prior to TEG implementation (Pre-TEG). Data are presented as mean?±?SEM. RESULTS: Emergency department pre-TEG versus TEG shock, and coagulation indices, were not different: systolic blood pressure (94?mmHg vs.101?mmHg), temperature (35.3°C vs. 35.9°C), pH (7.16 vs. 7.11), base deficit (?13.0 vs. ?14.7), lactate (6.5 vs. 8.1), international normalized ratio (INR; 1.59 vs. 1.83), and partial thromboplastin time (48.3 vs. 57.9). Although not significant, patients with Injury Severity Score range 26 to 35 were more frequent in the pre-TEG group. Fresh-frozen plasma (FFP)?:?RBCs, platelets?:?RBCs, and cryoprecipitate (cryo)?:?RBC ratios were not significantly different at 6 or 12 hours. INR at 6 hours did not discriminate between survivors and nonsurvivors (p?=?0.10), whereas r-TEG ?G? value was significantly associated with survival (p?=?0.03), as was the maximum rate of thrombin generation (MRTG; mm/min) and total thrombin generation (TG; area under the curve) (p?=?0.03 for both). Patients with MRTG of more than 9.2 received significantly less components of RBCs, FFP, and cryo (p?=?0.048, p?=?0.03, and p?=?0.04, respectively). CONCLUSION: Goal-directed resuscitation via r-TEG appears useful for management of trauma-induced coagulopathy. Further experience with POC monitoring could result in more efficient management leading to a reduction of transfusion requirements.

AB  - Abstract Background We sought to determine the feasibility of co-administering everolimus with a four-drug reinduction in children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) experiencing a first marrow relapse. Procedure This phase I study tested everolimus with vincristine, prednisone, pegaspargase and doxorubicin in patients with marrow relapse occurring >18 months after first complete remission (CR). The primary aim was to identify the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus. Three dose levels (DLs) were tested during dose escalation (2, 3, and 5 mg/m2/day). Additional patients were enrolled at the 3- and 5 mg/m2/day DLs to further evaluate toxicity (dose expansion). Results Thirteen patients enrolled during dose escalation and nine during dose expansion. During dose escalation, one dose-limiting toxicity occurred (grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia) in six evaluable patients at DL3 (5 mg/m2/day). The most common grade ≥3 adverse events were febrile neutropenia, infections, transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypophosphatemia. Two of the 12 patients treated at DL3 developed Rothia mucilaginosa meningitis. Nineteen patients (86%) achieved a second CR (CR2). Of those, 13 (68%) had a low end-reinduction minimal residual disease (MRD) level (≤10?3 by polymerase chain reaction?based assay). The CR2 rate for patients with B-cell ALL treated at DL3 (n = 12) was 92%; 82% of these patients had low MRD. Conclusions Everolimus combined with four-drug reinduction chemotherapy was generally well tolerated and associated with favorable rates of CR2 and low end-reinduction MRD. The recommended phase 2 dose of everolimus given in combination with a four-drug reinduction is 5 mg/m2/day. This promising combination should be further evaluated in a larger patient cohort.

AB  - Purpose? Traumatic diaphragmatic herniae are an uncommon sequelae of abdominal trauma which present a significant diagnostic challenge, especially when unaccompanied by other intraabdominal injuries necessitating exploratory laparotomy. Laparoscopic repair is a relatively new and uncommon procedure, with the literature consisting almost entirely of isolated case reports and small case series. We present one of our own cases, and perform a quantitative analysis of the combined literature experience to date. Methodology? Cases reports of laparoscopic repair of traumatic diaphragmatic herniae were identified by a Medline literature search. Clinical findings, technical decisions and outcomes were correlated via database. Results? Data from 50 cases was available. There was no common standard method of repair although the majority (31/50) were accomplished without the use of mesh. The major complication rate was 4%, the overall complication rate was 16%. Defects greater than 10cm long were associated with a 41% rate of open conversion, versus 0% if less than 10cm. There were no recurrences described. Conclusion? Laparoscopic repair of traumatic diaphragmatic herniae enjoys a low rate of major complications, whilst avoiding the morbidity of open repair. Several technical points remain open to operator preference, and we invite discussion regarding the merits of each.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the transfusion, hemostasis, and coagulation. In patients receiving massive transfusion, studies show a survival advantage in patients who received a high ratio of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to packed red blood cell (PRBC) during initial resuscitation. Studies originating from the military and civilian experience found that the optimal ratio of FFP:PRBC transfusion may be as high as 1:1. A prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing a transfusion ratio of 1:1:1 FFP:platelet:PRBC versus a 1:1:2 ratio demonstrated improved hemostasis and fewer deaths from hemorrhage by 24 hours in the 1:1:1 group. There was no increase in respiratory complications in the 1:1:1 group, despite prior retrospective associations between increased FFP transfusion and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is characterized by widespread microvascular thrombosis with activation of the coagulation system and impaired protein synthesis, leading to exhaustion of clotting factors and platelets.

AB  - Haemorrhage remains a major cause of potentially preventable deaths. Trauma and massive transfusion are associated with coagulopathy secondary to tissue injury, hypoperfusion, dilution and consumption of clotting factors and platelets. Concepts of damage control surgery have evolved, prioritizing the early control of the cause of bleeding by non-definitive means, while haemostatic control resuscitation seeks early control of coagulopathy. Haemostatic resuscitation provides transfusions with plasma and platelets in addition to red blood cells (RBCs) in an immediate and sustained manner as part of the transfusion protocol for massively bleeding patients. Transfusion of RBCs, plasma and platelets in a similar proportion as in whole blood prevents both hypovolaemia and coagulopathy. Although an early and effective reversal of coagulopathy is documented, the most effective means of preventing coagulopathy of massive transfusion remains debated and randomized controlled studies are lacking. Results from recent before-and-after studies in massively bleeding patients indicate that trauma exsanguination protocols involving the early administration of plasma and platelets are associated with improved survival. Furthermore, viscoelastic whole blood assays, such as thrombelastography (TEG)/rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM), appear advantageous for identifying coagulopathy in patients with severe haemorrhage, as opposed to conventional coagulation assays. In our view, patients with uncontrolled bleeding, regardless of its cause, should be treated with goal-directed haemostatic control resuscitation involving the early administration of plasma and platelets and based on the results of the TEG/ROTEM analysis. The aim of the goal-directed therapy should be to maintain a normal haemostatic competence until surgical haemostasis is achieved, as this appears to be associated with reduced mortality.

AB  - Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is an important phospholipid messenger involved in diverse physiological and pathological conditions. Actions of PAF are mediated by a specific PAF receptor (PAF-R) and the inhibition of biological activity by PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH). To elucidate the potential role of PAF in stimulating angiogenesis and trophoblast giant cell migration during gestation, we examined the expression and localization of PAF-R mRNA and protein as well as PAF-AH mRNA in the bovine placenta. RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were applied to placentomes from days 20, 80, 150, 200, 240, 270 of gestation, and immediately pre-partum (around day 280). PAF-R mRNA and protein were colocalized in immature trophoblast giant cells (TGC), uterine epithelial cells, and endothelial cells of fetal and maternal vessels. There was no apparent difference in placental PAF-R mRNA or protein levels until day 270. In contrast, in placentomes taken immediately pre-partum the localization of the immunohistochemical and hybridization signals switched from immature TGC and maternal epithelium to cells of the maternal stroma, particularly endothelial cells of maternal vessels. mRNAs for PAF-AH isoforms Ib (?- and ?-subunit), II, and plasma-isoform were detected by RT-PCR in placentomes throughout gestation. In tissue sections mRNA of the PAF specific PAF-AH-Ib ?-subunit was predominantly found in TGC, while the intensity of the signal was weaker in maternal epithelium and endothelium of fetal and maternal vessels. Corresponding to the PAF-R expression, mRNA of PAF-AH Ib was detected mainly in maternal endothelial cells prior to parturition. The constitutive expression and localization of PAF-R and PAF-AH in epithelial and endothelial cells during gestation, together with the parturition-related switch to the maternal stroma suggests a functional role of PAF for the interaction of TGC with the maternal epithelium, and thus may be associated with TGC migration, placental angiogenesis and pre-partum tissue programming.
