AB  - The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) JCA Special Issue Writing Committee is charged with reviewing, updating and categorizating indications for therapeutic apheresis. Beginning with the 2007 ASFA Special Issue (Fourth Edition), the committee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approach in the grading and categorization of indications. This Sixth Edition of the ASFA Special Issue has further improved the process of using evidence-based medicine in the recommendations by consistently applying the category and GRADE system definitions, but eliminating the ?level of evidence? criteria (from the University HealthCare Consortium) utilized in prior editions given redundancy between GRADE and University HealthCare Consortium systems. The general layout and concept of a fact sheet that was utilized in the Fourth and Fifth Editions, has been largely maintained in this edition. Each fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of therapeutic apheresis in a specific disease entity. This article consists of 78 fact sheets (increased from 2010) for therapeutic indications in ASFA categories I through IV, with many diseases categorized having multiple clinical presentations/situations which are individually graded and categorized.

AB  - Abstract Canine conjunctival tumors of vascular endothelial origin are common, although under-reported. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology of and potential risk factors for these tumors. This study evaluated 108 cases (70 hemangiomas, 38 hemangiosarcomas) from 8300 canine submissions between 1989 and 2004. Signalment, location, pigmentation, size, duration, diagnosis, margins, ancillary therapy, and geographic location were recorded. Follow-up information was available for 49 cases. Each case was matched with two unaffected controls and compared using logistic regression analysis. Average age upon presentation was 8.6 years; there was no sex predilection. Risk of conjunctival tumors was statistically different among breed groups (P = 0.0010), demonstrating a propensity to occur in groups likely to have increased outdoor activity. Primary involvement occurred within nonpigmented epithelium along the leading edge of the nictitating membrane (41/108) and temporal bulbar conjunctiva (33/108). The etiology remains unknown; however, the strong site predilection, involvement of nonpigmented epithelium, and development within specific breed classes strongly suggest ultraviolet (UV) light as a significant risk factor. In a full-logistic model including breed, gender, age, and UV exposure, UV was not a statistically significant variable (P = 0.1215). In a reduced-model including UV only, significance was approached (P = 0.0696) and posthoc contrast demonstrated a significant linear trend with increasing UV exposure (P = 0.0147). In separate analysis of risks associated with hemangiosarcoma, compared with hemangioma, breed was not significant while increasing UV exposure was significant (P = 0.0381). Early surgical therapy is recommended and may be curative; however, recurrence is possible and more likely with hemangiosarcomas (11/20).

AB  - Summary This chapter explains syndromes produced by the transfusion of incompatible blood. It considers haemolytic reactions due to causes other than incompatibility. By convention, red cell destruction is classified as either intravascular, characterized by rupture of red cells within the bloodstream and liberation of haemoglobin (Hb) into the plasma, or as extravascular, characterized by phagocytosis of red cells by macrophages of the mono-nuclear phagocyte system (MPS), with subsequent liberation of bilirubin into the plasma. Intravascular destruction may be produced by antibodies such as anti - A and anti - B that are readily lytic in vitro , although not all of the red cells are lysed in the plasma; some are sensitized and removed from the circulation by erythrophagocytosis, mainly in the liver. To ensure that haemolysis has not occurred ex vivo , the supernatant plasma of the unit or units of transfused blood should be inspected for free haemoglobin (Hb).

AB  - Summary Several issues related to the risks, costs, and availability of allogeneic blood transfusions have fueled research into other blood substitutes. Artificial oxygen carriers increase the oxygen content of blood by providing additional chemically modified hemoglobin molecules or inert fluids capable of dissolving large amounts of oxygen. Several such products have been developed and many have undergone extensive clinical investigation, demonstrating their efficacy in improving oxygen transportation and avoiding the need for allogeneic blood transfusions. Their clinical use, however, has been marred by the unresolved safety issues and significant numbers of complications. While further research is underway to improve the safety of artificial oxygen carriers, current products remain valuable assets as ?oxygen bridges? in the management of patients suffering from critically low hemoglobin levels at imminent risk of ischemia and death that cannot be transfused.
