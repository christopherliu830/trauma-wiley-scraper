AB  - Summary.? Background: Recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) risk factors include a first idiopathic DVT, strongly suggesting the existence of undiagnosed and/or unidentified prothrombotic abnormalities. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of locally increased red blood cell (RBC) aggregation on DVT pathogenesis in a rabbit model. Methods: DVT presence, flow and aggregation were measured in situ with ultrasound. Greatly enhanced aggregation was achieved by covalent linkage of Pluronic F98 to the RBC surface; coating with Pluronic F68, which very mildly enhances aggregation, was used as a coating control. On day 1, endothelial damage and a partial stenosis were surgically created on the left femoral vein whereas the right femoral vein was not manipulated. Results: A thrombus was formed within 30?min in six out of seven left femoral veins of animals receiving a 30% volume blood exchange with F98-coated RBC, whereas a thrombus occurred in only one out of seven veins in F68-transfused controls. In vivo imaging using quantitative ultrasound confirmed increased aggregation in the thrombosed veins of the F98 group compared with the F68 group and the contralateral vessel. For each group, five animals were followed for 2?weeks before being killed. In F98-transfused animals, lysis of clots occurred and the presence of chronic thrombi totally occluding the vein in three out of five animals was confirmed by histology. Conversely, in the F68 group, a single disorganized blood clot was observed in one out of five animals. Conclusions: A marked increase in RBC aggregation promotes thrombosis in rabbit femoral veins, confirming a pathophysiological role of locally altered hemorheology in the onset of DVT.

AB  - Summary.? Haemarthroses (intra-articular haemorrhages) are a frequent finding typically observed in patients with haemophilia. Diagnosis and treatment of these bleeding episodes must be delivered as early as possible. Additionally, treatment should ideally be administered intensively (enhanced on-demand treatment) until the resolution of symptoms. Joint aspiration plays an important role in acute and profuse haemarthroses as the presence of blood in the joint leads to chondrocyte apoptosis and chronic synovitis, which will eventually result in joint degeneration (haemophilic arthropathy). Ultrasonography (US) is an appropriate diagnostic technique to assess the evolution of acute haemarthrosis in haemophilia, although magnetic resonance imaging remains the gold standard as far as imaging techniques are concerned. Some patients experience subclinical haemarthroses, which eventually tend to result in some degree of arthropathy, especially in the ankles. Nowadays, the most effective way of protecting these patients is primary prophylaxis, which in practice changes severe haemophilia into moderate haemophilia, preventing or at least minimizing the occurrence of haemarthrosis. If primary prophylaxis is, for whatever reason not an option, secondary prophylaxis and enhanced on demand treatment should be considered. Two alternatives are available for inhibitor patients: (i) control of haemostasis using by-passing agents (rFVIIa or aPCCs) either as enhanced on demand treatment or secondary prophylaxis, as appropriate, following the same basic principles used for non-inhibitor patients and (ii) immune tolerance induction (ITI) to eradicate the inhibitor.

AB  - SUMMARY Today?s aging population has resulted in an increase in the number of major orthopedic surgical interventions in the elderly. High perioperative blood losses, together with a reduced tolerance to anemia, raise the likelihood of transfusion in this patient subgroup. The expected cost explosion in the transfusion system (cost-intensive quality management, imbalance between the number of donors and recipients) as well as the remaining transfusion-related risks of hemolysis, infection and immunosuppression demonstrate the high socioeconomical importance of developing institutional transfusion programs. This article summarizes (i) the pathophysiology of anemia compensation; (ii) the decision-making process for transfusion in healthy patients and patients with cardiovascular disease; and (iii) current pre- and intraoperative techniques aimed at reducing allogeneic transfusion in orthopedic patients.

AB  - Summary Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an important cause of acute hypoxic respiratory failure in pregnancy. This chapter discusses the definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, and management of ARDS in pregnant patients. Ware and Matthay described the pathophysiology of ARDS. Alveolar and/or capillary endothelial injury is the predominant mechanism in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Tocolytic-induced pulmonary edema (TPE) is an important cause of ARDS. Risk factors for TPE are multiple gestation, infection, and corticosteroid therapy. Management of TPE includes stopping the drug, diuresis, and supportive care. The management of ARDS in pregnancy is complicated. It requires a multidisciplinary approach that addresses both maternal and fetal aspects of care. There are no formal studies on the use of high-flow oxygen therapy (HFOT) in pregnancy, but the pregnant patient in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, with baseline raised respiratory drive, fits the phenotype of the patient who might benefit from early use of HFOT.

AB  - Abstract Periodontal diseases are among the most common diseases affecting humans. Dental biofilm is a contributor to the etiology of most periodontal diseases. It is also widely accepted that immunological and inflammatory responses to biofilm components are manifested by signs and symptoms of periodontal disease. The outcome of such interaction is modulated by risk factors (modifiers), either inherent (genetic) or acquired (environmental), significantly affecting the initiation and progression of different periodontal disease phenotypes. While definitive genetic determinants responsible for either susceptibility or resistance to periodontal disease have yet to be identified, many factors affecting the pathogenesis have been described, including smoking, diabetes, obesity, medications, and nutrition. Currently, periodontal diseases are classified based upon clinical disease traits using radiographs and clinical examination. Advances in genomics, molecular biology, and personalized medicine may result in new guidelines for unambiguous disease definition and diagnosis in the future. Recent studies have implied relationships between periodontal diseases and systemic conditions. Answering critical questions regarding host-parasite interactions in periodontal diseases may provide new insight in the pathogenesis of other biomedical disorders. Therapeutic efforts have focused on the microbial nature of the infection, as active treatment centers on biofilm disruption by non-surgical mechanical debridement with antimicrobial and sometimes anti-inflammatory adjuncts. The surgical treatment aims at gaining access to periodontal lesions and correcting unfavorable gingival/osseous contours to achieve a periodontal architecture that will provide for more effective oral hygiene and periodontal maintenance. In addition, advances in tissue engineering have provided innovative means to regenerate/repair periodontal defects, based upon principles of guided tissue regeneration and utilization of growth factors/biologic mediators. To maintain periodontal stability, these treatments need to be supplemented with long-term maintenance (supportive periodontal therapy) programs.

AB  - Summary Randomized controlled trials of good quality are a recognized means to robustly assess the efficacy of interventions in clinical practice. A systematic identification and appraisal of all randomized trials involving fresh frozen plasma (FFP) has been undertaken in parallel to the drafting of the updated British Committee for Standards in Haematology guidelines on the use of FFP. A total of 57 trials met the criteria for inclusion in the review. Most clinical uses of FFP, currently recommended by practice guidelines, are not supported by evidence from randomized trials. In particular, there is little evidence for the effectiveness of the prophylactic use of FFP. Many published trials on the use of FFP have enrolled small numbers of patients, and provided inadequate information on the ability of the trial to detect meaningful differences in outcomes between the two patient groups. Other concerns about the design of the trials include the dose of FFP used, and the potential for bias. No studies have taken adequate account of the extent to which adverse effects might negate the clinical benefits of treatment with FFP. There is a need to consider how best to develop new trials to determine the efficacy of FFP in different clinical scenarios to provide the evidence base to support national guidelines for transfusion practice. Trials of modified FFP (e.g. pathogen inactivated) are of questionable value when there is little evidence that the standard product is an effective treatment.
