AB  - Summary This chapter describes the techniques and methods for processing whole blood (WB) collections into components to help ensure the product is suitable for storage and transfusion, thus minimizing the risk to recipients. It discusses the quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) of the blood product and equipment are essential parts of blood processing. The chapter focuses on the component separation of WB, note that while apheresis can be used to separate components at the point of bleeding, this is not a realistic process in most veterinary practices. The optimal centrifuge speed for blood product processing depends on several factors. These include centrifuge specifications such as rotor size, but also the sedimentation characteristics of the desired blood components. QC and QA are the processes required to ascertain that all elements concerning the production and storage of manufactured goods, in this case blood products, are achieving expected specifications.

AB  - Abstract Background This study investigated the potential for bias introduction when selecting controls for secondary analysis of case-control study data. Methods We used a data set previously collected for an acute brain bleeding analysis (ABBA) study, which was designed to investigate the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (HS) resulting from the use of phenylpropanolamine in Korea. Cases in that study had experienced an HS. Each HS case was matched with age- and gender-based hospital and community controls. Information was obtained on drug exposures including nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NANSAIDs). Odds ratios (OR) for, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of, experiencing an HS were calculated using conditional logistic regressions for each control group. Results A total of 940 patients were matched with 1880 controls. The OR of HS occurring in NANSAID users was 1.18 (95%CI, 0.80?1.73) in community controls and 0.67 (95%CI, 0.45?0.98) in hospital controls. The majority of the hospital controls were selected from patients who had visited neurology, neurosurgery, or orthopedic departments. Conclusion The difference between OR values estimated from hospital and community controls could be the result of selection bias. The study data were originally obtained for a different purpose than this study, and NANSAID use was not considered when the hospital controls were selected. When performing secondary analyses, extra care is needed to note whether the results are consistent across control groups and whether there are indications of bias related to the selection of those controls.

AB  - Abstract Background Knowledge about patients with acute liver failure (ALF) in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) is lacking. Aims To evaluate whether the pattern of ALF would be similar to previous studies and whether, despite potentially low transplantation rates, mortality would be comparable. Methods We obtained data from the ANZ Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database and the ANZ Liver Transplant Registry for 10 years commencing 2005 and analysed for patient outcomes. Results During the study period, 1?022?698 adults were admitted to intensive care units across ANZ, of which 723 had ALF. The estimated annual incidence of ALF over this period was 3.4/million people and increased over time (P = 0.001). ALF patients had high illness severity (Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation III 79.8 vs 50.1 in non-ALF patients; P < 0.0001) and were more likely to be younger, female, pregnant and immunosuppressed. ALF was an independent predictor of mortality (odds ratio 1.5 (1.26?1.79); P < 0.0001). At less than 23%, the use of liver transplantation was low, but the mortality of 39% was similar to previous studies. Conclusions ALF is a rare but increasing diagnosis in ANZ intensive care units. Low transplantation rates in ANZ for ALF do not appear to be associated with higher mortality rates than reported in the literature.

AB  - Abstract Vascular anomalies (VAs) are classified as tumors or malformations depending on their clinical characteristics, pathological diagnosis, and genomic information. Diagnosis can be challenging because of the heterogeneity of clinical presentation; thus, the best diagnosis and care are provided by an interdisciplinary team of specialists. Over the past 10 years, an increasing number of pediatric hematologist/oncologists are caring for patients with VAs secondary to new medical therapy options and clinical trials. This paper focuses on complicated VA issues often seen by the pediatric hematologist/oncologist. The paper reviews clinical pearls on diagnosis, histology, radiology, and treatment options.

AB  - Abstract Mycobacterium marinum is a photochromogenic mycobacterium that is ubiquitous in the aquatic environment. In the general population, exposure to aquaria is the most common cause of M. marinum infection. Known as ?swimmer's granuloma? or ?fish tank granuloma,? M. marinum is an occupational hazard for aquarium cleaners and fishermen. There are several reports in the literature of M. marinum infection in immunocompromised hosts, including those with solid organ transplants, but none in patients who have received stem cell transplants (SCTs). To our knowledge, this is a first report of disseminated M. marinum infection in an SCT recipient who continued to develop new skin lesions even after months of targeted therapy. The implications are that elderly patients who receive T-cell-depleted SCTs may be at prolonged risk for pathogens dependent on cellular immunity, and the presentation of illness with such pathogens may be more severe and widely disseminated than might otherwise be expected.
