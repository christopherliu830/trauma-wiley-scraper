AB  - Abstract Cell communication through extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been defined for many years and it is not limited only to neighboring cells, but also distant ones in organisms receive these signals. These vesicles are secreted from the variety of cells and are composed of a distinctive component such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. EVs have different classified subgroups regarding their cell origin, in this context, exosomes are the most appealing particles in cell biology, especially clinical in recent years and are represented as novel therapeutic agents with numerous advantages alongside and/or over cell therapy. However, cell therapy had a hopeful outcome in gastrointestinal diseases which have minimal alternatives in their treatments. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), liver fibrosis, gastrointestinal cancers are the examples that cell therapy and immunotherapy were applied in their treatment, therefore, the cell products like exosomes are the beneficial option in their treatment even cancers with promising results in animal models. In this review, we consider the main defined biogenesis, function, and component of secreted exosomes in different cells with a specific focus on the potential application of these exosomes as a cell-free therapeutic approach in gastrointestinal diseases like IBD, gastric cancer, and colon cancer. Additionally, exosomes role as therapeutic reagents mainly mesenchymal stem cells and dendritic cell-derived exosomes in different studies have been under intense investigation and even they are being studied in different clinical trials. Therefore, all these striking functions described for secretome implies the importance of these biocarriers.

AB  - Abstract BACKGROUND Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is frequent after cardiac surgery, but data on its incidence and perioperative risk factors are scarce for children with congenital heart disease. METHODS SIRS incidence within 72 hours following cardiac surgery was evaluated in a secondary analysis of children enrolled to a treatment-free control group of a randomized controlled trial. Intraoperative parameters were investigated for their association with SIRS using multivariable fractional polynomial logistic regression models. Effects of SIRS on various organ functions and length of stay were evaluated using time-varying Cox regression models. RESULTS In 116 children after cardiac surgery (median age [range]: 7.4 month [1 day-16.2 years]) SIRS occurred in n?=?39/102 with and n?=?1/14 without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Duration of CPB (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.28 per hour; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17; 4.42) and amount of fresh frozen plasma (HR: 1.23 per 10?mL/kg; 95%CI 1.06; 1.42) were identified as predictors for SIRS; neonates seemed to be less susceptible for SIRS development (HR: 0.86; 95%CI 0.79; 0.95). SIRS was associated with organ dysfunction (HR: 2.69; 95%CI 1.41; 5.12) and extended stay in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) (median: 168 vs. 96 hours; p?=?0.007). CONCLUSIONS SIRS is a frequent complication after pediatric congenital heart surgery; it affects nearly one third of children and prolongs PICU stay significantly. Duration of CPB and amount of fresh frozen plasma were identified as important risk factors. Neonates seem to be less susceptible to SIRS development.

AB  - The past five decades have seen an improvement in the mortality and morbidity of sickle cell disease (SCD) because of prophylaxis against infectious complications, improved and expanded red cell transfusions, implementation of hydroxyurea therapy, and advances in supportive care. Now that the majority of patients in the western hemisphere reaches adulthood, end organ diseases are frequent, which include vasculopathic complications such as chronic leg ulcers. The management of patients with leg ulcers requires the hematologist to lead a team of health care professionals, and investigates the presence of associated, but potentially still occult signs of vasculopathy, such as pulmonary hypertension, renal disease, priapism and retinopathy. These complications may be asynchronous, and long term careful screening is indicated, in order to ensure early diagnosis and intervention. It is crucial to address both the immediate consequences of pain, infection and disability, and long term effects on quality of life, employment and stigma associated with chronic ulceration. Recent insights into their pathophysiology may have practical implications. We propose a holistic approach to the management of patients' physical and emotional problems and mechanisms of ulcers formation and delayed healing. An overview of topical and systemic therapies for chronic ulcers is given, with the understanding that wound care therapy is best left to the wound specialists, medical and surgical, with whom the hematologist must keep an open line of communication. In the absence of evidence-based guidelines, our opinion is based on both a critical review of the literature and our personal clinical and research experience. Am. J.

AB  - Overview The mouth is a frequent site of direct and indirect adverse side effects of cancer therapy. In myelosuppressed patients, its diverse microbiota makes the oral cavity both a site of local infection and a potential source of bacteremias and sepsis. While about half of all patients being treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy will develop some form of oral toxicity or infection, almost every patient receiving an aggressive myeloablative regimen or local radiotherapy to the head and neck manifests acute and chronic toxicities. The diversity of the tissues found in and around the mouth?keratinized and nonkeratinized mucosa, bone, salivary glands, and teeth?contributes to the range of susceptibility, acuity, and clinical implications of regimen-related oral complications. In almost all instances, precancer treatment elimination or control of existing oral diseases and aggressive management of oral health during cancer therapy favorably impacts outcomes.

AB  - Summary The variety of obstetric emergencies that can present to the obstetrician is vast, and includes acute medical and surgical as well as obstetric conditions. Many such emergencies, including collapse and cardiac arrest, can be preceded by early warning signs in women with risk factors and rapid recognition, effective triage and appropriate response are crucial in optimizing outcome. A sound understanding of the pathologies involved and the principles of their treatment should help the obstetrician to establish a reliable, reproducible and robust systematic approach to recognizing and managing these life-threatening conditions in pregnancy. The chapter shows how to minimize the risks and consequences of such emergencies as well as how to manage them in the acute situation.

AB  - Abstract Robust ex vivo expansion of umbilical cord blood (UCB) derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) should enable the widespread use of UCB as a source of cells to treat hematologic and immune diseases. Novel approaches for HSPC expansion have recently been developed, setting the stage for the production of blood stem cell derived products that fulfill our current best known criteria of clinical relevance. Translating these technologies into clinical use requires bioengineering strategies to overcome challenges of scale-up, reproducibility, and product quality assurance. Clinical-scale implementation should also define criteria and targets for cost-effective cell manufacturing. As production strategies become more effective, new opportunities in the therapeutic use of ex vivo expanded hematopoietic cell products will emerge. Herein we examine key technological milestones that need to be met in order to move ex vivo expanded HSPC therapies from the bench-top to the bedside in a robust and reliable manner.

AB  - Abstract Neural stem cells (NSCs) exist in vascularized niches. Although there has been ample evidence supporting a role for endothelial cell-derived soluble factors as modulators of neural stem cell self-renewal and neuronal differentiation there is a paucity of data reported on neural stem cell modulation of endothelial cell behavior. We show that co-culture of NSCs with brain-derived endothelial cells (BECs) either in direct contact or separated by a porous membrane elicited robust vascular tube formation and maintenance, mediated by induction of vascular vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and activation of vascular VEGFR2 and TrkB by NSC NO. Nitric oxide (NO) scavengers and sequestration of VEGF and BDNF blunted this induction of tube formation, whereas addition of exogenous NO donor, rBDNF and rVEGF rescued the induction of tube formation. Further, rBDNF enhanced NSC eNOS activation and NO generation, suggesting an inducible positive feed-back signaling loop between NSCs and BECs, providing for homeostasis and responsiveness of the resident NSCs and BECs comprising the neurovascular niche. These findings show the importance of reciprocal modulation of NSCs and BECs in induction and maintenance of the neurovascular niche and underscores their dynamic interactions. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
