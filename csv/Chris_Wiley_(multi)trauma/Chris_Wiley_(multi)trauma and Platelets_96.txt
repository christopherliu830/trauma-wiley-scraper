AB  - Fibronectin (FN) may be involved in time- and stage-dependent and inter-related controlled processes of inflammation, coagulation, and wound healing accompanying peripheral arterial disease (PAD). In the present study, FN and FN-containing extra-domain A (EDA-FN), macromolecular FN-fibrin complexes, and FN monomer were analysed in the plasma of 142 PAD patients, including 37 patients with restenosis, for 37 months after revascularisation. FN concentration increased significantly in the plasma of PAD patients within 7 to 12 months after revascularisation, whereas the high concentration of EDA-FN was maintained up to 24 months, significantly higher in the group 7 to 12 months after revascularisation with recurrence of stenosis and lower in the PAD groups 1 to 3 months and 4 to 6 months after revascularisation with comorbid diabetes and ulceration, respectively. The relative amounts of FN-fibrin complexes up to 1600 kDa and FN monomer were significantly higher, within intervals of 4 to 24 months and 4 to 6 months after revascularisation, respectively. Moreover, the relative amounts of 750 to 1600 kDa FN-fibrin complexes within 13 to 24 months after revascularisation were higher in comparison with those in the group without restenosis. In conclusion, high levels of EDA-FN and FN-fibrin complexes could have potential diagnostic value in the management of PAD patients after revascularisation, predicting restenosis risk.

AB  - Summary.? Decreased levels of most coagulation factors and thrombocytopenia are the main haemostatic abnormalities of cirrhosis. As a consequence, this condition was, until recently, considered as the prototype acquired coagulopathy responsible for bleeding. However, recent evidence suggests that it should, rather, be regarded as a condition associated with normal or even increased thrombin generation. The bleeding events that occur in these patients should, therefore, be explained by the superimposed conditions that frequently occur in this setting. Due to elevated levels of factor VIII (procoagulant driver) in combination with decreased protein C (anticoagulant driver), which are typically found in patients with cirrhosis, a procoagulant imbalance, defined as a partial resistance to the in vitro anticoagulant action of thrombomodulin, can be demonstrated. Whether this in vitro hypercoagulability is truly representative of what occurs in vivo remains to be established. However, the hypothesis that it may have clinical consequences is attractive and deserves attention. The possible consequences that we discuss herein include whether (i) cirrhosis is a condition associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism or portal vein thrombosis; (ii) the hypercoagulability associated with cirrhosis has any other role outside coagulation (i.e. progression of liver fibrosis); and (iii) anticoagulation should be used in cirrhosis. Although apparently provocative, considering anticoagulation as a therapeutic option in patients with cirrhosis is now supported by a rationale of increasing strength. There may be subgroups of patients who benefit from anticoagulation to treat or prevent thrombosis and to slow hepatic fibrosis. Clinical studies are warranted to explore these therapeutic options.

AB  - Summary Congenital (hypo)dysfibrinogenemia patients may have obstetric complications during their pregnancies. This study aimed to evaluate thromboelastography (TEG) as a potential tool for assessing the tendency for obstetric complications in those patients in a non-pregnant state. A total of 22 female subjects with congenital (hypo)dysfibrinogenemia were recruited. Nine subjects had histories of obstetric complications and the other 13 subjects had at least one uneventful pregnancy without obstetric complications as yet. Detailed clinical investigation and phenotype/genotype detection were carried out, and both kaolin-activated TEG and functional fibrinogen TEG (FF-TEG) were applied in all subjects. Significant differences were identified in all TEG parameters except for R and angle between these two groups (P < 0.05) by covariance analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of discrimination between these two groups of patients was performed for TEG parameters. Significantly high odds ratio (OR) of obstetric complications occurrence were demonstrated in K ≥ 3.8 min, maximum amplitude (MA) ≤ 54.2 mm, comprehensive index (CI) ≤ ?3 (11.67, 95% CI 1.527?89.121, P < 0.05 in all), and MA-CFF ≤ 12.1 mm (20.00, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.967?203.322, P = 0.002). Moreover, MA-CFF had better prognostic performance, with a corresponding area under the receiver operating curve of 0.923 (range 0.815?1.031, P = 0.001). This study suggests that (hypo)dysfibrinogenemia patients with values outside of the cut-off values of TEG assays under non-pregnant state may have a higher risk of obstetric complications occurring when they are pregnant. No parameters under non-pregnant state in clinical laboratory have ever been reported to be risk factors for obstetric complication occurrence in (hypo)dysfibrinogenemia patients. This study explored such parameters in TEG assays and found that parameters of TEG assays under non-pregnant status might predict the occurrence of obstetric complications, which could provide physicians with important information about whether fibrinogen replacement therapy is required, so as to prevent the occurrence of obstetric complications, especially for patients who are asymptomatic in daily life.

AB  - Summary: Proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are critically involved in activation of the coagulation system in sepsis, leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Natural anticoagulants such as antithrombin (AT) and activated protein C (APC) regulate the coagulation system by inhibiting thrombin generation. In addition to these anticoagulant effects, both AT and APC have been shown to attenuate inflammatory responses induced by various noxious stimuli in rats such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. AT promotes the endothelial release of prostacyclin, a potent anti-inflammatory prostaglandin that inhibits the monocytic production of TNF-α, by interacting with cell-surface heparin-like substances. APC directly inhibits the production of TNF-α by inhibiting the activation of both nuclear factor ?B (NF?B) and activator protein-1 in monocytes stimulated with LPS. Thrombomodulin, an endothelial membranous integral protein that binds thrombin, exerts anti-inflammatory effects by generating APC. Furthermore, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, a natural anticoagulant for the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation system, also attenuates LPS-induced inflammatory responses in rats by inhibiting TNF-α production by monocytes. These findings strongly suggest that natural anticoagulants could regulate inflammatory responses as well as the coagulation system in rats by inhibiting the monocytic production of TNF-α. Such anti-inflammatory properties of natural anticoagulants are potentially important for their replacement in patients with sepsis who frequently develop DIC and organ failure as inflammatory responses.

The prevention of excessive scarring is more successful than the treatment afterwards. Multiple options exist for prevention, wound repair modulation, and treatment of scars. This publication includes an overview of the pathogenesis, clinical classification, documentation, prevention, and invasive and non-invasive therapy options.

AB  - Summary Procedures involving the spinal column represent one of the most common of the major orthopedic surgeries in the pediatric-aged patient. During surgical procedures to correct spinal deformities, there are several potential factors that may result in morbidity or even mortality, including co-morbid disease processes, patient positioning, blood loss, and neurological damage. The following chapter reviews the developmental and gross anatomy of the spine, details the more common surgical procedures, outlines the preoperative assessment, discusses intraoperative anesthetic care, including methods to limit the need for homologous blood transfusion and spinal cord monitoring, and provides options for postoperative care, including pain management.
