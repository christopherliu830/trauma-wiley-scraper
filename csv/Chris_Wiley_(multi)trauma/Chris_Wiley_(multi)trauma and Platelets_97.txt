AB  - Summary Arterial access site complications are common after cardiac catheterization and their incidence is related to procedure complexity and vascular access bore size. This chapter focuses on the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of femoral, brachial, and radial artery complications after percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) and other vascular interventions. The most common complications related to common femoral artery (CFA) access include local bleeding, femoral artery pseudoaneurysm (FAP) formation, retroperitoneal hematoma (RPH), arteriovenous fistula (AVF) formation, and lower extremity ischemia due to arterial thrombosis. Meta-analysis data, including observational studies and small-scale randomized controlled trials, show that vascular closure devices (VCDs) permit a shorter time to hemostasis and patient ambulation compared to manual or mechanical compression after PCI. Brachial artery access has classically been used as an alternative approach for coronary and peripheral endovascular interventions in patients with severe arterial disease or other conditions that prohibit CFA access.

AB  - Abstract Successful treatment of many childhood diseases once considered terminal has resulted in the emergence of long-term effects of the disease or consequences of treatment that were previously unrecognized. Many of these long-term effects involve the central nervous system (CNS) and are developmental in the way that they emerge over time. Because we are now able to observe the natural history of childhood diseases such as sickle cell anemia or HIV, or the consequences of treatment of disease such as leukemia, brain tumors, or kidney disease, we are also able to study a number of biological mechanisms that result in long-term neurocognitive impairment. While some of the neurodevelopmental outcomes can be directly linked to structural damage of the CNS, other systems (e.g., hematologic, immunologic, pulmonary) appear to play crucial indirect roles in the development of the CNS and neurocognitive abilities because of the way that they affect the course of brain development and activity of the brain across time. Important interactions between acute disease factors, biological mechanisms, age at the time of disease or treatment effect, and disruptions in patterns of development after successful treatment or management all provide support for a neurodevelopmental model of childhood chronic illness. Testing this model may make it possible to more accurately predict the timing and degree of severity of long-term neurodevelopmental consequences, provide guidance for improved treatment and prevention, and offer better understanding of neurodevelopmental disruptions that occur in other non-chronic illness related disabilities.

AB  - Summary.? Biostate? is a double virally inactivated, plasma derived coagulation factor VIII (FVIII)/von Willebrand factor (VWF) concentrate registered and used in Australia, New Zealand and Asia for the treatment of patients with haemophilia A. Although Biostate? has been well characterized for FVIII and VWF (ratio 1:2 respectively) and shows a similar VWF multimeric pattern to normal plasma, limited published data is available on its clinical efficacy and safety in patients with von Willebrand disorder (VWD) who require surgical procedures. We retrospectively assessed the efficacy and safety of Biostate? in all VWD patients treated at three Australian haemophilia treatment centres undergoing invasive procedures or surgery over a 29-month period between April 2003 and September 2005. A chart review of 43 VWD patients (26 VWD type 1, 12 VWD type 2, 5 VWD type 3; 21 male, 22 female; mean age 52?years, range 19?80?years) undergoing 58 surgical procedures (24 major, 34 minor) was performed. For each procedure, data were collected on Biostate? dosage and administration, adverse reactions, haemostatic efficacy and bleeding events. Haemostatic efficacy of Biostate? was assessed as excellent in 78% or good in 22% of procedures. There were no bleeding events attributable to lack of efficacy in any patients. No adverse reactions related to the administration of Biostate? were observed. These results suggest that Biostate? is both safe and efficacious for the prevention of excessive bleeding in VWD patients undergoing surgery or invasive procedures.

AB  - Recent studies describe families with both elevated plasma HRG levels and thrombosis. In order to study the possibility that allelic variants of the HRG locus are associated with differences in HRG level, we studied linkage between HRG levels and a dinucleotide repeat polymorphism in a Dutch family which was selected on the presence of both thrombosis and elevated plasma HRG levels. No other known risk factors from thrombosis were found in this family. Linkage was calculated between the dinucleotide repeat and the HRG level considering the HRG level as a quantitative phenotype assuming a population prevalence of elevated HRG of 5%. Two classes of HRG levels were defined by a mean and a variance: one class with normal HRG levels and a second class with high HRG levels. Using a mean HRG level of 99% for individuals with a normal HRG level and 145% for individuals with high HRG, a maximum lod score of 4.17 (odds in favour of linkage of 22 000:1) was found at a recombination fraction of 0, indicating linkage. Considering the pedigree, an association was found between the presence of a specific allele (no. 6) of the dinucleotide repeat polymorphism and plasma HRG levels. Family members carrying allele 6 were found to have higher HRG plasma levels compared with family members lacking allele 6 (149% v 109% respectively). We conclude that in this family, linkage is found between the HRG locus and the HRG level, and that a HRG gene coupled to allele 6 of the dinucleotide polymorphism is associated with elevated plasma HRG levels. No evidence was found for a causal relationship between elevated plasma HRG levels and thrombosis in this family.

AB  - Summary This chapter explores how to approach joint pain from a rheumatological perspective. It presents the case examples of an on-call SHO bleeped to review a 60 year old lady with a hot, swollen, painful right wrist and a 55 year old lady referred to the Rheumatologist by the general practitioner with a two week history of painful, swollen left wrist joint. Reactive arthritis is often seen following gastrointestinal and genito-urinary infections with specific micro-organisms. Pre-existing rheumatological disease increases the risk of septic arthritis and although the leflunomide was stopped it has a long half-life conferring an immunosuppressed state. Erythema of the skin overlying the affected joint raises the probability of either septic arthritis or crystal arthropathy. Variability in disease presentation and disease evolution over time constantly revise SQs. Paying attention to the SQs in flux ensures that are consciously considering other possibilities.

AB  - Summary Reactive oxygen species generated during various metabolic and biochemical reactions have multifarious effects that include oxidative damage to DNA leading to various human degenerative and autoimmune diseases. The highly reactive hydroxy radical (·OH) can interact with chromatin and result in a wide range of sugar and base-derived products, DNA?protein cross-links and strand breaks. Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that after modification the DNA becomes highly immunogenic and the induced antibodies exhibit variable antigen-binding characteristics. Systemic lupus erythematosus, a prototype autoimmune disease, is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies to multiple nuclear antigens. The detection of 8-hydroxyguanosine in the immune complex derived DNA of systemic lupus erythematosus patients reinforces the evidence that reactive oxygen species may be involved in its pathogenesis. Increased apoptosis and decreased clearance of apoptotic cells as observed in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) might well be a contributory factor in systemic autoimmunity. Clinically, titres of autoantibodies are closely related to the degree of renal inflammation. Anti-DNA antibodies may combine with circulating antigen and contribute to the deposition of immune complexes in renal glomeruli.
