AB  - Pancreatitis is a gastrointestinal disease with a worldwide sharp surge during the past decade. Pancreatitis includes acute and chronic subtypes, which are graded based on the amount of pancreatic inflammation. Phytoconstituents represent a promising class of therapeutic agents with wide acceptability not only based on folk practices but sound presence of pharmacological and molecular evidences. Growing research evidence indicates that different molecular mechanisms are involved in their protective effect. Many phytoremedies have been tried for the treatment of pancreatic injuries and have shown success in preclinical animal models of pancreatitis. The literature was largely collected through PubMed and Google scholar database. A large proportion of phytochemicals targets the inflammatory cascade and modulates the overtly acting redox balance among which nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells is the key molecule. Inhibition of apoptosis (artemisinin, embelin), inflammasome (withaferin A), neutrophil rolling (fucoidan), Ca+2 release (caffeine), mitogen activated protein kinase (guggulsterone) and many other novel mechanisms apart from antioxidant effect have been postulated behind the protective effect of phytoconstituents. The present review deals to fill the gap of hitherto unavailable comprehensive review on various plant products screened for the treatment of pancreatitis. The possible mechanistic profile of these phytochemicals is summarized. Copyright ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - ?Hurricane Katrina ? Unorganized, unprepared and internationally embarrassed? Despite well defined, pre-exisiting organizational plans and national response strategies, Hurricane Katrina exposed major weaknesses in the ability of a region or nation to respond to a tragedy of significant magnitude. Significant lessons were learned from the event. Must have in place: ?? A national and regional disaster response plan ?? A ?Chain of Command / Responsibility? Doctrine ?? A national and regional disaster response system ?? National, regional and local ?Incident Command? structures ?? Emergency supply stockpiles ?? Pre-established communication frequencies Major considerations: ?? Make this a military function ? make all civilian agencies report to them ?? Military has the comm, logistics, command structure, personnel and the training to take on this mission. ?? Train for an event at regional and national levels ?? Cross train all responders ?? Eliminate the red tape at the front end of the event ?? Mobilize and ?do it?

AB  - Summary Reactive oxygen species generated during various metabolic and biochemical reactions have multifarious effects that include oxidative damage to DNA leading to various human degenerative and autoimmune diseases. The highly reactive hydroxy radical (·OH) can interact with chromatin and result in a wide range of sugar and base-derived products, DNA?protein cross-links and strand breaks. Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that after modification the DNA becomes highly immunogenic and the induced antibodies exhibit variable antigen-binding characteristics. Systemic lupus erythematosus, a prototype autoimmune disease, is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies to multiple nuclear antigens. The detection of 8-hydroxyguanosine in the immune complex derived DNA of systemic lupus erythematosus patients reinforces the evidence that reactive oxygen species may be involved in its pathogenesis. Increased apoptosis and decreased clearance of apoptotic cells as observed in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) might well be a contributory factor in systemic autoimmunity. Clinically, titres of autoantibodies are closely related to the degree of renal inflammation. Anti-DNA antibodies may combine with circulating antigen and contribute to the deposition of immune complexes in renal glomeruli.

AB  - The clinical trigger to consider the presence of a coagulopathy is the onset of non-surgically controllable bleeding. While earlier consensus documents considered this event predictable by modelling blood loss, and factor level decline, we now recognize confounding variables such as shock, hypothermia, metabolic disturbances and fibrinolysis confuse the picture to such an extent traditional treatment algorithms are irrelevant. The monitoring of coagulopathy by traditional coagulation screens also lacks validation, and is usually so delayed in response time to become irrelevant to appropriate management. Attaining euvolaemia is possible with large volume dedicated infusion systems but in a patient with massive mediator release and comorbidities may not achieve adequate tissue oxygen delivery. Evidence based transfusion triggers are still lacking. Management of coagulopathy is by component replacement early. Delays occur because of slow coagulation test turnaround times, and the place of newer point of care monitors and thrombelastography needs evaluation. Delay in delivery of blood components due to processing time may worsen the outcome. Factor VIIa probably has a unique place in the management of coagulopathy in these patients, but studies are needed to define dosage and time of dose (2). The management of acidosis and hyperlactaemia are fundamentally improved by better perfusion, but short term correction may be indicated to reinforce coagulation factor function.

AB  - Objective? Playground and sporting accidents account for a large percentage of paediatric injuries, yet they are largely preventable. The aim of this study is to investigate the risk factors and mechanisms associated with upper and lower limb fractures in children. Method? 145 children admitted to a regional Australian hospital (Coffs Harbour Base Hospital) totalling 207 upper and lower limb fractures over an 12 month period between January 1st 2004 to December 31st 2004 were identified from the hospital medical records database. Retrospective analysis was performed on demographic data, fracture type and mechanisms causing the fracture. Results? Males accounted for 69.7% of all childhood limb fractures. 77.7% of all fractures were upper limb, while 22.3% were lower limb. The leading causes of lower limb fractures were football injuries, push bike accidents, and aquatic accidents, accounting for 51.8% of all lower limb fractures. Monkey bars, swings, trees, skateboard and scooter accidents were associated with a relatively high prevalence of upper limb injuries when compared to other injury mechanisms. Football, push bike and skateboard accidents alone accounted for 40.6% of fractures in our male patients. This figure was only 4.5% in our female patients, and in general, the causes of fractures in females are more evenly distributed. Conclusion? Limb fractures in children have a diverse range of causes, but specific fractures occur more frequently in particular sexes and with certain activities. There is a role for further injury prevention targeting specific high risk groups and activities.

AB  - The single vehicle rollover accident is a highly complex crash mode and there is growing concerns about its incidents and consequences in central Australia. The aim of this paper is to assess: 1 The incidence and injury patterns of rollover accidents 2 Pre rollover characteristics on rollover propensity 3 The injury severity and outcome of rollover accidents The absence of speed limit, unfenced roads, vast distances traveled, unsealed roads and high use of alcohol makes the spectrum of MVA? s in NT unique. In this two year period of study from Jan 2004 ? Dec 2005, there were 470 motor vehicle accidents of which 126 were single vehicle rollover accidents. 132 patients were admitted; 73 NT residents of which 45 were of aboriginal origin and 14 were international tourists. There were 37 deaths in Central Australian roads and 20 were due to single vehicle rollover accidents. None of the deaths occurred at the Alice Springs hospital . Most rollover accidents occur at a speed above 100?km/h. 24 patients had an ISS?>?15 and 35% of all injuries were to head, neck and shoulder. Rollovers occurred when the vehicle left the road way and encountered a tripping mechanism such as soft dirt or loose gravel. Those who were belted fared better than those unbelted occupants. Completely ejected occupants were all unbelted. Mean time to hospital from time of accident was 8Hrs. Primary prevention strategies need to involve remote communities, tourists traveling in central Australia and address alcohol and restraint use.

AB  - Background Severe blood loss is a common complication of craniofacial reconstruction surgery. The antifibrinolytic ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA) reduces transfusion requirements in children undergoing cardiac surgery and in older children undergoing spine surgery. Tranexamic acid (TXA), another antifibrinolytic with a similar mechanism of action, has been shown to reduce blood loss and transfusion requirements in children undergoing craniofacial surgery. However, TXA has been associated with an increase in post-operative seizures and is more expensive than EACA. There is currently little published data evaluating the efficacy of EACA in children undergoing craniofacial surgery. Methods This is a retrospective study of prospectively collected data from our craniofacial perioperative registries for children under 6 years of age who underwent anterior or posterior cranial vault reconstruction. We compared calculated blood loss, blood donor exposures, and post-operative drain output between subjects who received EACA and those who did not. Results The registry queries returned data from 152 subjects. Eighty-six did not receive EACA and 66 received EACA. The EACA group had significantly lower calculated blood loss (82 ± 43 vs. 106 ± 63 ml/kg, P = 0.01), fewer intraoperative blood donor exposures (median 2, interquartile range 1?2 vs. median 2, interquartile range 1?3; P = 0.02) and lower surgical drain output in the first post-operative 24 h (28 ml/kg vs. 37 ml/kg, P = 0.001) than the non-EACA group. Conclusion In this analysis of prospectively captured observational data, EACA administration was associated with less calculated blood loss, intraoperative blood donor exposures, and post-operative surgical drain output.

AB  - Summary The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the clinical features of recurrent thrombosis in the venous or arterial circulation and fetal losses. Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), particularly against the phospholipid binding protein beta-2 glycoprotein I (?2GPI), play an important role in APS pathological mechanisms. aPL can activate intracellular signal transduction in a ?2GPI-dependent manner to induce inflammatory responses, and promote hypercoagulable state and recurrent spontaneous abortion when ?2GPI is associated with the cell surface receptor. In vivo and in vitro studies show that Annexin A2 (ANXA2) is the high affinity receptor that connects ?2GPI to the target cells. However, ANXA2 is not a transmembrane protein and lacks an intracellular signal transduction pathway. Growing evidences suggest that the transmembrane protein toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) might act as an ?adaptor? for intracellular signal transduction. This review focuses on the role of TLR4 and its signalling pathway in APS pathological mechanisms which will help us better understand the pathological processes of this syndrome.

AB  - Abstract Blood transfusion systems have contributed considerably to human health and welfare. Nevertheless, numerous problems remain, such as infection of hepatitis virus and HIV, blood type mismatching, immunological response, short shelf life, and costs. Blood substitutes have been under development for decades to overcome those problems. Some substitutes for plasma components are already established, such as plasma expanders, electrolytes, and recombinant coagulant factors. Herein, we specifically address the research and development of substitutes for the function of red blood cells (artificial oxygen carriers, or oxygen infusions) such as chemically modified Hbs, encapsulated Hbs, synthetic heme derivatives, and perfluorochemicals. Unexpected side effects hindered further development of the early artificial oxygen carriers and indicated the physiological significance of the structure of red blood cells. Well-designed and selected artificial oxygen carriers that meet requisite criteria will be eventually realized. They will provide remarkable innovation in conventional medical treatments.
