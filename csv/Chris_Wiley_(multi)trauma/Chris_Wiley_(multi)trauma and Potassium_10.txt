AB  - Abstract A 3500-year-old papyrus from ancient Egypt provides a list of treatments for many diseases including ?bite hair loss,? most likely alopecia areata (AA). The treatment of AA remained largely unchanged for over 1500 years. In 30 CE, Celsus described AA presenting as scalp alopecia in spots or the ?windings of a snake? and suggested treatment with caustic compounds and scarification. The first ?modern? description of AA came in 1813, though treatment still largely employed caustic agents. From the mid-19th century onwards, various hypotheses of AA development were put forward including infectious microbes (1843), nerve defects (1858), physical trauma and psychological stress (1881), focal inflammation (1891), diseased teeth (1902), toxins (1912) and endocrine disorders (1913). The 1950s brought new treatment developments with the first use of corticosteroid compounds (1952), and the first suggestion that AA was an autoimmune disease (1958). Research progressively shifted towards identifying hair follicle-specific autoantibodies (1995). The potential role of lymphocytes in AA was made implicit with immunohistological studies (1980s). However, studies confirming their functional role were not published until the development of rodent models (1990s). Genetic studies, particularly genome-wide association studies, have now come to the forefront and open up a new era of AA investigation (2000s). Today, AA research is actively focused on genetics, the microbiome, dietary modulators, the role of atopy, immune cell types in AA pathogenesis, primary antigenic targets, mechanisms by which immune cells influence hair growth, and of course the development of new treatments based on these discoveries.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the airway and perioperative management. Beta Blockers have potential beneficial effects when taken perioperatively. In addition to helping prevent/control arrhythmias, beta blockade also helps reduce myocardial oxygen demand that is produced by catecholamine release during stress periods. The most widely accepted theory of the continuation of statin therapy in the perioperative period is due to plaque stabilization. This is thought to occur secondary to the reduction of thrombin-induced expression and lipopolysaccharide induced expression of tissue factor. Assessment for difficult cricothyrotomy can be performed by patient history and physical examination. The mnemonic ?SMART? is a tool that can used to assess for difficulties that may occur: S: Surgery; M: Mass; A: Access or Anatomy; R: Radiation; and T: Tumor. Clinicians should be aware of identifiable factors in patients with difficult airways as these can dictate outcomes.

AB  - Abstract: A retrospective epidemiologic study of 110 patients with chronic paronychia (CP) showed a female-male ratio of 2·3:1, whereas the ratio of patients attending the same clinic was 1·1:1 (p < 0·001). The peak age range of patients with CP (40?49 years) generally was greater than that of the general dermatologic patients (20?29 years). Seventy-seven percent of the patients with CP were ?manual workers,? of which 48% were homemakers. Chronic paronychia was more common on the right fingers than the left fingers. The most commonly affected fingers were the right thumb (62%), followed by the right middle finger (52%), left thumb (57·6%), and left middle finger (51·5%). Mechanical trauma appears to be an important predisposing factor in CP. Sixty-two percent of 68 patients who had nail fold smears had positive findings for budding yeast cells, suggestive of candidal infection. All of the six patients for whom nail fold bacterial cultures were performed had positive results for enteric flora.

AB  - Summary As the incidence of diabetes mellitus continues to increase in the United Kingdom, more diabetic patients will present for both elective and emergency surgery. Whilst the underlying pathophysiology of type 1 and type 2 diabetes differs, there is much good evidence that controlling the blood glucose to >?10?mmol.l?1 in the peri-operative period for both types of diabetic patients improves outcome. This should be achieved with a glucose?insulin?potassium regimen in all type 1 diabetics and in type 2 diabetics undergoing moderate or major surgical procedures. After surgery, a decrease in the catabolic hormone response resulting from good analgesia and the avoidance of nausea and vomiting should allow early re-establishment of normal glycaemic control.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the principles and physics of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and its current use in human and veterinary medicine. Data sources: Research for this manuscript included current human and veterinary literature. Human-based studies: Human studies of BIA and multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (MFBIA) have resulted in a considerable amount of controversy about the capability of BIA and MFBIA to accurately assess exact fluid volume and distribution. The recent emphasis on point-of-care monitoring has resulted in the use of BIA and MFBIA to evaluate the rapid changes in fluid distribution that can occur with trauma and various disease states. Veterinary-based studies: The use of BIA and MFBIA has been limited in veterinary medicine. However, studies in domestic and laboratory animals have shown good correlation with the isotope dilution method. The effectiveness of BIA/MFBIA in monitoring the critically ill veterinary patient has not yet been evaluated. Conclusion: BIA and MFBIA have been used to evaluate a variety of biological parameters such as nutritional status, cardiac output, and intracellular and extracellular fluid volumes. Recent studies using BIA and MFBIA to evaluate fluid compartmentalization and shifts in critically ill human patients have shown promising results. BIA and MFBIA provide immediate results that may aid in the assessment of a patient's clinical progress and response to therapy.

AB  - Objectives To review available information regarding in-office procedures for benign vocal fold lesions (BVFL). Methods PubMed term search on office/awake laryngeal procedures for any of the following specific lesions: Reinke's edema (RE), polyps, nodules, varices, vocal process granuloma, and vocal fold (VF) scar. Results In-office ablative and nonablative laser procedures have been described for BVFL, including RE, polyps, varices, and granuloma. Fiber-based lasers used include potassium titanyl phosphate, pulsed dye laser, and more recently CO2. In-office intralesional steroid injection (ISI) for BVFL targets the inflammatory process involved with the lesion and may induce regression of polyps, nodules, RE, and granuloma. Botulinum toxin-induced ?voice rest? has been described as adjunctive treatment for refractory VF nodules or vocal process granuloma. Most in-office techniques for treating BVFL rely on induction of lesion regression rather than complete lesion removal, as in conventional operative microsurgery. When treating VF scarring, in-office procedures aim to alter the wound-healing process; ISI targets the inflammatory phase and angiolytic lasers target the proliferative phase. Conclusion In-office procedures for BVFL apply new technology that can potentially lower risk and cost. Although numerous case series have shown the potential of these procedures, data that thoroughly compares outcomes with those of microlaryngoscopic techniques is needed.

AB  - Summary One of the most common events in equine practice is the presentation of a trauma resulting in skin and soft-tissue wounds. The physiological benefits of utilizing photobiomodulation therapy as part of the treatment plan in the management of these lesions are a relief of pain, a modulation of the inflammatory response, an increase in circulation, and a subsequent acceleration of the healing process. This chapter provides an overview of the physiological and cellular mechanisms involved, the optimum application techniques, dosages, the frequency of treatment, and the integral role of photobiomodulation therapy in the care of these patients.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the demographics, clinical characteristics, diagnostic findings, underlying etiologies, treatment, and outcome associated with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP) in cats; and to identify clinical feature differences among cats with asthma associated secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (AASSP) versus nonasthma-associated secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (NAASSP). Design Retrospective case series. Setting University teaching hospital. Animals Sixteen client-owned cats with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results Domestic short hair was the predominant breed in this study (n = 15). The median age was 8 years old (range: 7 weeks to 17 years) with no sex predilection. Fourteen cats were affected by multi-lobar pulmonary pathology of infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic causes. Asthma was the most common cause of spontaneous pneumothorax (25%). Ten of 12 treated cats survived the initial episode of spontaneous pneumothorax to discharge with medical management, including all 4 cats with AASSP. Reoccurrence was documented in 4 cats. Pulmonary lobectomy was curative for 1 cat with congenital accessory lung lobe emphysema. No difference in clinical presentation was identified between cats with AASSP and cats with NAASSP. Conclusions Feline SSP is frequently associated with extensive pulmonary pathology. Supportive medical management is most appropriate, except in rare cases with focal congenital abnormalities that may benefit from surgical intervention. AASSP appears to carry a good prognosis for short-term outcome (survival to discharge). Clinical assessment, imaging, and invasive diagnostics were required to differentiate between AASSP and NAASSP.

AB  - Summary Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the fingernails and/or toenails caused by dermatophytes, yeasts and non-dermatophyte moulds. The epidemiology of onychomycosis in Serbia is yet to be fully established. This epidemiological study was aimed at evaluating the epidemiology of onychomycosis in a sample of the Serbian patients at risk of onychomycosis, to determine the fungal aetiological agents and to identify the possible risk factors. The study population included 374 patients from six centres in Serbia with suspected onychomycosis. Demographic data, data about comorbidities, lifestyle, clinical aspects of onychomycosis, trauma, excessive perspiration and personal and family history of previous onychomycosis were studied. Laboratory confirmation of diagnosis was done by direct microscopy, fungal culture and PCR. Diagnosis of onychomycosis was confirmed in 50.8% of patients, who tested positive to at least one laboratory test (direct microscopy, fungal culture or PCR). Trichophyton rubrum was predominant both on toenails (85.98%) and on fingernails (38.46%). Independent risk factors for onychomycosis were: old age (OR = 2.285; P < 0.001), family history of previous onychomycosis and/or tinea pedis (OR = 2.452; P = 0.005), excessive perspiration (OR = 2.165; P = 0.002) and higher degree of hyperkeratosis (OR = 1.755; P = 0.020). This is a first epidemiological study of onychomycosis from Serbia.

AB  - Summary Symptomatic acute adrenal insufficiency (adrenal crisis) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and should be managed as a medical emergency. Adrenal crisis is brought about by lack of production of the adrenal hormone cortisol and/or mineralocorticoids. It presents with marked symptoms and signs, characteristic laboratory abnormalities, and requires immediate treatment. The severity of this condition is related to the central role of these hormones in energy, salt, and fluid homeostasis. There are two forms of adrenal insufficiency: primary and secondary. Primary adrenal insufficiency (also termed Addison's disease), is caused by the inability of the adrenal cortex to produce sufficient amounts of glucocorticoids and/or mineralocorticoids (e.g., due to autoimmune-mediated destruction of adrenocortical tissue). Secondary adrenal insufficiency (also termed central hypoadrenalism) results when adrenal glucocorticoid production is deficient or absent because of corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]) deficiency. Chronic care of primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency is also briefly described; as this is an important opportunity to reduce future admissions, improve quality of life, and decrease morbidity.

AB  - In this special issue of Academic Emergency Medicine, the Editorial Board is privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM), May 22?25, 2000, San Francisco, CA. The depth, breadth, and future of our specialty and our practice are reflected in these brief research summaries; the creativity, talent, and dedication of our researcher colleagues are documented on these pages. We are honored to be able to share them with you. This year, 990 abstracts were received and considered for presentation at the Annual Meeting. Fifty percent were submitted electronically. Each abstract was evaluated by six to nine independent reviewers who were blinded to the author, the study institution, and the other reviewers. Final determinations for acceptance were made by members of the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by Judd Hollander, and the Program Committee chair, Sue Stern. These decisions were based on the mean score received after review and the space available for presentations within the program. The type of presentation (oral platform vs poster), the assigned topic section, and the position of presentation in the program were also determined. As was the case last year, we have reproduced these abstracts from electronic versions supplied by the submitting authors. In general, we have not edited, proofread, changed, or corrected the abstracts; they appear as submitted by the authors, who are responsible for their content. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. The institution listed is that of the presenting author. A list of common abbreviations used in the abstracts begins on page 596. An index to key words, authors, and topics begins on page 598.
