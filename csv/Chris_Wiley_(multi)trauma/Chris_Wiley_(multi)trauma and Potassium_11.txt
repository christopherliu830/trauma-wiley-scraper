AB  - The administration of MPSS is advocated both for limiting spinal cord injury from Hansen Type I intervertebral disk protrusion (T1-IVD) and from the potential surgical trauma associated with laminectomy. Recent studies suggest that treatment with MPSS does not significantly alter functional outcome and is associated with significant complications including gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic necrosis, and increased rates of infection. The purpose of this prospective study was to report the results of laminectomy without MPSS treatment in non-ambulatory dogs with T1-IVD. The study group involved dogs weighing less than 15?kg that had a laminectomy between T11-T12 and L4-L5 for T1-IVD. Dogs included had not been treated with MPSS, were unable to walk but able to sense ?deep pain?. The dogs were evaluated post-operatively for the ability to walk (stand and advance pelvic limbs), pain (reaction to paraspinal palpation or movement), and incontinence (dribbling urine/feces or failure to completely void urine). Fifty-one dogs met the inclusion criteria. Prior to surgery 0% of the dogs could walk (26 paralyzed, 25 paretic), and 98% were painful. Incontinence was not assessed or was unknown in most cases. Ten days following surgery, 90% were walking, 98% were pain-free, and 82% were fully continent. By 6 weeks, 100% were walking, 6% were painful, and 86% fully continent. By 16 weeks, 96% were pain-free, and 88% were fully continent. These results obtained with laminectomy alone are comparable or superior to reports of those with MPSS administration and suggest that MPSS is not necessary for a successful outcome in dogs receiving laminectomy for T1-IVD.

AB  - Poor patient compliance is common during dialysis therapy. We aimed to study incidence of noncompliance, contributing factors, and effects on quality of life (QOL) among cadaveric renal transplantation waiting list patients. We included 86 renal transplantation waiting list patients (56M/30F). Dialysis duration, previous renal transplantation history, comorbid conditions, interdialytic weight gain, predialysis BUN, creatinine, potassium, and phosphate were recorded. Noncompliance criteria were skipping >1 dialysis session or shortening a dialysis session>10?min in 1 month, interdialytic weight gain>5.7% of body weight, predialysis serum potassium >6?mEq/L, and phosphate level >7.5?mg/dl. There were 49 noncompliant (age: 46.8?±?21.8 years, HD duration: 83.9?±?48.7 months) and 37 compliant (age: 42.8?±?12.1 years, HD duration: 96.5?±?45.2 months) patients. QOL was evaluated by short form 36 and depression levels by Beck Depression Inventory. Previous renal transplantation was present in 24.4% and comorbid diseases in 31.3% of all patients. In depressed patients, 77.8% had comorbid diseases. No difference was found between the groups considering age, gender, dialysis duration, previous transplantation history, and comorbid diseases (p?>?0.05). Noncompliant patients had lower QOL (p?<?0.04). Noncompliant patients had higher degree of depression (p?=?0.01). QOL and Beck scores were negatively correlated (p?=?0.001, r?=??0.561). Noncompliance to diet and dialysis therapy is associated with depression, which further decreases QOL in renal transplantation waiting list patients. Early diagnosis of depression, is possible by monitoring noncompliance, and therapeutic intervention may benefit during the transplantation-waiting period.

AB  - The moisture contents of foods, fluids, and parenteral solutions taken in and of all samples excreted, the water of oxidation of fuel mixtures burned, and the evaporative water loss must be determined in order to obtain a quantitative picture of water balance. Because there is a tendency to retain water after trauma, surgery, or an acute illness, changes in the water compartment of the body may lead to changes in body weight that may be considered erroneously as changes in energy or protein stores. Measurement of water balance, in addition to calorie and nitrogen balance is one of the most accurate means of accounting for these changes in body composition. Fluid and electrolyte therapy and nutritional supplementation can be tailored to meet the patient's specific needs by utilizing this information. Application of these principles to the care of hospitalized patients outside of the research setting will be discussed.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe a large segmental (sub-total) mandibulectomy for removal of an undifferentiated sarcoma in a horse. Study Design Clinical report. Animals A 10-year-old mare. Methods A combination of methods including computed tomography (CT) were used to diagnose a large undifferentiated sarcoma of the right mandible. A large segmental mandibulectomy extending from 3?cm below the right temporomandibular joint to immediately caudal to tooth 407 was used to perform an en-bloc resection of the mass under general anesthesia. Results Surgery time was 11?hours and 35?minutes and total anesthesia time, 12?hours and 40?minutes. The mare was eating well 3 days after surgery. Some postoperative skin sloughing occurred, but the cosmetic and functional outcome was good. The mare continued to do well, with no evidence of disease recurrence, 24 months after surgery. Conclusions Three-dimensional reconstruction of the CT images was instrumental in surgical planning. A very large portion of the mandible can be removed in a horse with acceptable cosmetic and functional outcome.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the analgesia and anesthesia. Dexmedetomidine is a sedative, analgesic, and anxiolytic that is an agonist on the central alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. It does not cause respiratory depression, and can be used in patients who are not intubated. Dexmedetomidine provides anesthesia without decreasing respiratory drive. It works through the central nervous system (CNS), as an alpha-2 receptor agonist. The manifestations of local analgesia toxicity start with tachycardia and hypertension. As blood levels continue to rise, symptoms can continue to progress to myocardial depression, hypertension, and decreased cardiac output. Ketamine is classified as a dissociative anesthetic. It produces amnesia and analgesia. Propofol can be used in patients with neurologic injury. It can decrease intracranial pressure, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral metabolism.

AB  - Summary Hypothalamic obesity is an intractable form of obesity syndrome that was initially described in patients with hypothalamic tumours and surgical damage. However, this definition is now expanded to include obesity developing after a variety of insults, including intracranial infections, infiltrations, trauma, vascular problems and hydrocephalus, in addition to acquired or congenital functional defects in central energy homeostasis in children with the so-called common obesity. The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying hypothalamic obesity are complex and multifactorial. Weight gain results from damage to the ventromedial hypothalamus, which leads, variously, to hyperphagia, a low-resting metabolic rate; autonomic imbalance; growth hormone-, gonadotropins and thyroid-stimulating hormone deficiency; hypomobility; and insomnia. Hypothalamic obesity did not receive enough attention, as evidenced by rarity of studies in this group of patients. A satellite symposium was held during the European Congress of Obesity in May 2011, in Istanbul, Turkey, to discuss recent developments and concepts regarding pathophysiology and management of hypothalamic obesity in children. An international group of leading researchers presented certain aspects of the problem. This paper summarizes the highlights of this symposium. Understanding the central role of the hypothalamus in the regulation of feeding and energy metabolism will help us gain insights into the pathogenesis and management of common obesity.

AB  - Abstract Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare and often fatal soft-tissue infection involving the superficial fascial layers of the extremities, abdomen or perineum. Progression to septic shock can occur very rapidly with its associated high morbidity and mortality. NF is usually caused by beta haemolytic streptococci; less often a poly-microbial isolate is the cause. It typically occurs in patients with some degree of immune dysfunction. We present a case of severe pneumococcal necrotizing fasciitis in an obese patient with Type 2 diabetes. There was no history of trauma or evidence of diabetes-related complications. The initial presentation was with features of septic arthritis of the left knee, which subsequently progressed to NF. Differentiation from cellulitis is often difficult in the early stages. Invasive pneumococcal infections are extremely rare, with only a few reported in the literature. Moreover, our case highlights the need to consider other differential diagnoses (and to look out for complications) in patients with diabetes, especially if there is little clinical response to the initial treatment.

AB  - Summary Supragingival and subgingival plaque appear to be the multifactorial initiating sources of oropharyngeal inflammation in cats. Inflammation may occur secondary to internal triggers and stimulation from antigens and pathogens located within or below the gingiva and oral mucosa. Gingivitis is the beginning stage of periodontal disease where the inflammation is confined to the gingival soft tissues and does not clinically extend into the tooth's support. Periodontal diseases are the most common oral maladies diagnosed in dogs and cats. Furcation involvement or exposure occurs secondary to periodontitis. Oronasal fistula are established communications between the oral and nasal cavities secondary to advanced periodontal disease extending from the palatal surfaces of the maxillary canine in dogs and from traumatic extraction of the maxillary canine teeth. Professional oral care includes mechanical procedures performed in the oral cavity.

AB  - Scurvy is a rarely seen disease resulting from a deficiency of vitamin C. We present a case of scurvy in a 65-year-old man. The patient reported heavy alcohol abuse over the last several years. He also reported that his diet consisted of cheese pizzas only. On physical examination, he was noted to have spontaneous ecchymosis of his lower extremities (denying any history of trauma); poor dentition; and corkscrew hairs on his chest, abdomen, and legs, with associated perifollicular petechia. Punch biopsy of his skin lesions revealed perivascular lymphohistiocytic inflammation, with some focal perifollicular erythrocyte extravasation. A serum ascorbic acid level was<0.12 mg/dL (normal range, 0.20?1.9 mg/dL). A diagnosis of vitamin C deficiency was made. The patient was successfully treated with 1 g/d vitamin C for the first 5 days, followed by a dose of 500 mg/d. Though scurvy is rarely seen in modern times, it is important to identify who is at risk and to recognize the clear and classic signs and symptoms associated with scurvy. Failure to diagnose this disease can potentially lead to expensive and unnecessary medical tests, as well as missing a very simple treatment that can prevent infection and even death.

AB  - Abstract The close proximity of pelvic organs makes the genitourinary system susceptible to injury during major pelvic surgery. Iatrogenic injury remains the most common cause of lower urinary tract trauma. Recent modifications in surgical technique, such as sharp mesorectal incision and nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, have decreased the incidence of many of these complications. Genitourinary complications due to pelvic surgery remain common, however, and as new surgical advancements are made, new complications may present. An understanding of the prevention, recognition, and treatment of urologic complications is important for every surgeon performing major pelvic surgery. Semin. Surg.

AB  - Pedalling during hemodialysis (HD) has been shown to increase solute clearance in a previous study. In the present study, we aimed to test whether an easy to perform exercise program, not requiring a special device, could yield similar outcomes. Fifteen HD patients with the mean age of 48.4?±?3.8 years were enrolled into the study. Patients with significant access recirculation (>10%), moderate to severe coronary artery disease, moderate to severe heart failure, severe chronic obstructive lung disease, and history of lower extremity surgery during last three month period were excluded. All patients were studied on two consecutive HD sessions with identical prescriptions. At the first session, standard HD was applied without exercise, whereas in the second session lower extremity exercise of 30 minutes duration was added. Reduction rates and rebound for urea, creatinine, and potassium and Kt/V were calculated. Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied in analysis and p?<?0.05 was accepted as significance level. All patients completed the study. When both sessions were compared, mean arterial blood pressure (97?±?3?mmHg vs 120?±?4?mmHg, p?<?0.001) and heart rate (77?±?1 beats/min vs 92?±?3 beats/min, p?<?0.001) were higher in the exercise group. On the other hand, urea reduction rates, rebound values of urea, creatinine, and potassium were similar in both groups. Conclusion:?In the study, we did not observe any changes in solute rebound and clearance with the exercise. Shorter duration of the exercise may be the explanation of failure to achieve desired outcomes. Increasing patients? tolerance and fitness levels by means of steadily increasing exercise programs may be of help. Additionally, mode of exercise may also be responsible for different outcomes.

AB  - A simple technique for autotransfusion has been developed and used in the successful resuscitation of dogs suffering severe trauma and /or hemorrhage. The purpose of this abstract is three-fold: 1) Describe the criteria used in case selection; 2) Describe the method used; and 3) Describe the results of its use in a limited number of cases. Case Selection: The criteria used were the following: 1. Ongoing significant hemorrhage or severe hemorrhage noted in a body cavity where the blood could be collected; 2. Acute hemorrhage amounts deemed to be life-threatening (>40% calculated blood volume [88?ml/kg]); 3. Where other choices (fresh or stored homologus blood, Oxyglobin) in amounts needed were not possible. Method: Blood was aspirated into a suction canister using a Pool or Yankauer suction tip, with the tip placed under the pool (s) of blood to eliminate as many bubbles in the collection process as possible. If the canister was not sterilized it was scrubbed with a surgical prep solution and then rinsed with tap water prior to blood collection. The blood in the canister was poured into a wide opening in a hanging empty plastic intravenous fluid bag with a blood administration set inserted. The blood was intravenously administered by gravity drip as needed. No attempt was made to use any anticoagulant. Amounts of blood given, clinical responses, and complications were recorded. Results: The procedure was used in 12 dogs: 5 abdominal hemorrhage, 3 thoracic hemorrhage, 2 hemorrhage from both abdomen and chest, 2 vertebral vein hemorrhage. All blood administered was given during the operation or within 2 hours. Amounts transfused ranged from 30 to 120?ml/kg (body weight [mean 48?ml/kg]). No animals died acutely from signs thought to be associated with the transfusion of this blood. Those cases surviving to discharge were 4 abdominal, 2 thoracic, 1 combined, and 1 vertebral vein. There were no infections attributed to the autotransfusion. It is concluded that this technique can be recommended and may be considered life-saving in selected cases.

AB  - Sepsis, shock, multiple trauma, and burns are often associated with altered metabolism characterized by severe catabolism, wasting of the lean body mass, immune dysfunction, and compromised wound healing. Nutrition support is one of the mainstays in the management of these critically ill patients and is aimed at minimizing these complications. The purpose of this article is to compare stress hypermetabolism and starvation metabolism, to review current recommendations for the provision of energy and substrate to the critically ill patient, and to review pertinent literature regarding enteral vs parenteral nutrition. Finally, this article will provide a brief overview of new and future therapies with emphasis on specific substrates and growth factors and the potential for their use in the critically ill patient.

AB  - A 12-year-old crossbred dog (case 1) and a 12-year-old Shetland sheepdog (case 2) were presented with a history of lameness and distal limb swelling. Physical examination revealed joint effusions and asymmetrical swellings of the extremities. In case 1, a diagnosis of arthritis and cellulitis was made on fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the synovium and subcutis. In case 2, bone biopsies and synovial aspirates diagnosed osteomyelitis and arthritis. A diagnosis of pancreatic disease was made on the findings of marked elevations of serum lipase concentrations and ultrasonographic identification of pancreatic masses in both cases. Both the cases were non-responsive to symptomatic management and were subsequently euthanased. Postmortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of panniculitis, arthritis and osteomyelitis in both cases. A pancreatic exocrine adenoma was identified in case 1 and a pancreatic adenocarcinoma with widespread metastases in case 2. To the authors' knowledge the association of panniculitis, polyarthritis and osteomyelitis with pancreatic disorders has not been reported previously in canine clinical cases.

AB  - Open heart surgery was performed during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to surgically correct subvalvular aortic stenosis in seven dogs. After initiation of total CPB, cardiac arrest was induced by antegrade and retrograde administration of blood cardioplegia. The subvalvular fibrous stenosis was resected through a transverse aortotomy. Intraoperatively and postop-eratively, dobutamine, nitroprusside, lidocaine, blood(-products), and crystalloid solutions were used to manage hypotension and optimize cardiac index. Aortic cross-clamp time varied from 73 to 166 minutes, and duration of CPB varied from 130 to 210 minutes, latrogenic incision into the mitral valve in two dogs was the most significant introperative complication. Postoperative complications included: hypoproteinemia (n = 7), premature ventricular depolarization (n = 6), increased systemic vascular resistance index (n = 5), increased O2 extraction (n = 3), pulmonary edema (n = 2), and decreased cardiac index (n = 1). All seven dogs were discharged alive and in stable condition. Six dogs are alive and in stable condition after a mean follow up of 15.8 months. This is the first detailed report of CPB in a series of clinical veterinary patients. Using the techniques described in this paper, open heart surgery of considerable duration can be performed successfully in dogs with significant myocardial hypertrophy and endomyocardial fibrosis secondary to subvalvular aortic stenosis.
