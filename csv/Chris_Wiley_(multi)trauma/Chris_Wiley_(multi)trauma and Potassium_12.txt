AB  - The editors of Academic Emergency Medicine are pleased and privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, May 16?19, 2007, in Chicago. The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.

AB  - Abstract Proper pancreas retrieval during multi-organ recovery is one of the cornerstones of technically successful whole-organ pancreas transplantation. With evolving surgical approaches for organ retrieval and implantation, it has become standard to procure the pancreas in conjunction with other abdominal organs without compromising either vasculature, graft quality, or transplant outcomes. This review summarizes the major steps required for proper whole-organ retrieval of the pancreas allograft with suggestions and tips whenever alternative approaches are available.

AB  - Open heart surgery was performed during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to surgically correct subvalvular aortic stenosis in seven dogs. After initiation of total CPB, cardiac arrest was induced by antegrade and retrograde administration of blood cardioplegia. The subvalvular fibrous stenosis was resected through a transverse aortotomy. Intraoperatively and postop-eratively, dobutamine, nitroprusside, lidocaine, blood(-products), and crystalloid solutions were used to manage hypotension and optimize cardiac index. Aortic cross-clamp time varied from 73 to 166 minutes, and duration of CPB varied from 130 to 210 minutes, latrogenic incision into the mitral valve in two dogs was the most significant introperative complication. Postoperative complications included: hypoproteinemia (n = 7), premature ventricular depolarization (n = 6), increased systemic vascular resistance index (n = 5), increased O2 extraction (n = 3), pulmonary edema (n = 2), and decreased cardiac index (n = 1). All seven dogs were discharged alive and in stable condition. Six dogs are alive and in stable condition after a mean follow up of 15.8 months. This is the first detailed report of CPB in a series of clinical veterinary patients. Using the techniques described in this paper, open heart surgery of considerable duration can be performed successfully in dogs with significant myocardial hypertrophy and endomyocardial fibrosis secondary to subvalvular aortic stenosis.

AB  - Objective: To demonstrate whether ECG changes induced by hyperkalemia correspond with previously described changes. Design: Prospective Animals: Eighteen dogs and 22 cats with serum potassium levels >5.5?mEq/L as the result of various disease processes. Procedure: Once hyperkalemia was documented, the following data were collected: ECG (n=40), total magnesium (mg/dl) (n=18), total calcium (mg/dl) (n=31), and venous blood gas (n=20). Animals were divided into 5 groups based on expected ECG's changes associated with hyperkalemia (mEq/L): Group 1- 5.5?6.5; Group 2- 6.6?7.0; Group 3- 7.1?8.5; Group 4- 8.6?10.0; Group 5- >10.0. ECG's were interpreted to determine if the rate, rhythm and changes in the P-QRS-T complex were similar to those previously reported. Results: Twelve ECGs demonstrated changes previously described, while 28 did not: Group 1 (n=7)- 1/7; Group 2 (n=2)- 0/2; Group 3 (n=14)- 4/14; Group 4 (n=6)- 3/6; Group 5 (n=11)- 4/11. Many ECG abnormalities not previously described were also identified such as atrioventricular dissociation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Blood gas analysis revealed acidemia (19/20) with severe acidemia (pH<7.2) in the majority (16/19). Hypocalcemia was documented (5/13) and most of these patents (4/5) were in Group 5. Hypermagnesemia was documented in the majority of patients (10/18), though not in one particular group. Clinical Implications: It is difficult to establish typical ECG changes in patients with hyperkalemia, which represents a departure from the historical description. Hypocalcemia may be involved with ECG changes and arrhythmias in Group 5. Hypermagnesemia causes electrocardiographic abnormalities similar to those described with hyperkalemia and therefore does not explain the results of this study. There likely are complex interactions with electrolytes and acid base abnormalities that affect ECG formation.

AB  - Although excessive consumption of ethanol in alcoholic beverages causes multi-organ damage, moderate consumption, particularly of red wine, is protective against all-cause mortality. These protective effects could be due to one or many components of the complex mixture of bioactive compounds present in red wine including flavonols, monomeric and polymeric flavan-3-ols, highly colored anthocyanins as well as phenolic acids and the stilbene polyphenol, resveratrol. The therapeutic potential of resveratrol, firstly in cancer chemoprevention and then later for cardioprotection, has stimulated many studies on the possible mechanisms of action. Further indications for resveratrol have been developed, including the prevention of age-related disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. These improvements are remarkably similar yet there is an important dichotomy: low doses improve cell survival as in cardio- and neuro-protection yet high doses increase cell death as in cancer treatment. Fewer studies have examined the responses to other components of red wine, but the results have, in general, been similar to resveratrol. If the nonalcoholic constitutents of red wine are to become therapeutic agents, their ability to get to the sites of action needs to be understood. This mini-review summarizes recent studies on the possible mechanisms of action, potential therapeutic uses, and bioavailability of the nonalcoholic constituents of alcoholic beverages, in particular resveratrol and other polyphenols.

AB  - Summary This chapter commences with the management of suspected giant cell arteritis (GCA). It is recommended to consider vasculitis in the patient with systemic symptoms and headache or evidence of organ dysfunction. The diagnosis of a specific vasculitis is based on the pattern of organ injury, characteristic features on imaging, the size of involved blood vessels and histological findings on biopsy. GCA usually presents with new-onset headache in older people, associated with constitutional upset; it carries a significant risk (20-30%) of visual loss from ischaemic optic neuropathy, and so needs urgent assessment and treatment. Typical presentations of acute vasculitis include headache, neurological presentation with stroke, hearing loss, and haemoptysis. With the exception of suspected GCA, early intervention with high-dose corticosteroid therapy is rarely needed, and should not be given unless advised by a specialist. The chapter also presents information on considerations in suspected GCA and new presentation of suspected systemic vasculitis.

AB  - Abstract Aims To synthesize the evidence evaluating if blood samples are similar when obtained from peripheral intravenous cannula compared with venepuncture. Design A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken. Data sources Searches were conducted in databases for English language studies between January 2000?December 2018. Review methods The search adhered to the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using Joanna Briggs critical appraisal instruments. The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE. Results Sixteen studies were identified. Findings suggest haemolysis rates are higher in blood sampled from peripheral intravenous cannula. However, haemolysis rates may be lower if a peripheral intravenous cannula blood sampling protocol is followed. For equivalence of blood test results, even though some results were outside the laboratory, allowable error and were outside the Bland?Altman Level of Agreement, none of these values would have required clinical intervention. With regard to the contamination rates of blood cultures, the results were equivocal. Conclusion Further research is required to inform the evidence for best practice recommendations, including, if a protocol for drawing blood from a peripheral cannula is of benefit for specific patient populations and in other settings. Impact Venepuncture can provoke pain, anxiety and cause trauma to patients. Guidelines recommend blood samples from peripheral intravenous cannula be taken only on insertion. Anecdotal evidence suggests drawing blood from existing cannulas may be a common practice. Further research is required to resolve this issue.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to evaluate if magnesium deviations correlate with higher 180 day overall mortality or increased morbidity, compared to controls. Methods We conducted a retrospective study on 5369 patients with 22,003 magnesium values treated at the Adult Intensive Care Unit at Skåne University Hospital, Lund, Sweden during 2006?2014. The patients were retrospectively divided into a control group with only normal magnesium values 0.7?1.0 mmol/l, and three study groups; hypomagnesemic; Mg2+ < 0.7 mmol/l, hypermagnesemic; Mg2+ > 1.0 mmol/l and an unstable mixed group showing both hypo/hypermagnesemia. Gender, age, disease severity represented by maximum organ system SOFA score, renal SOFA score, lowest potassium value and diagnoses classes were included in a Cox hazard model in order to adjust for confounding factors, with time to death in the first 180 days from the ICU admission as outcome. Results The hypermagnesemic study group and the mixed group showed increased hazard ratios for mortality; 1.4 (CI 98.3% 1.2, 1.6, P < 0.0001) and 2.1 (CI 98.3% 1.2, 2.8, P < 0.0001) respectively, compared to controls, while the hypomagnesemic group did not reach significance. In addition, patients in the hypermagnesemic and the mixed groups are older, more ill with significantly higher EMR and SOFA scores and show significantly longer ventilator times and ICU stays, compared to controls. Conclusions Patients with magnesium deviations are more ill compared to patients with explicitly normal magnesium values throughout the ICU stay. Cox analysis suggests that the magnesium deviation itself might have an impact on mortality.

AB  - Our aim was to investigate contact sensitization in children over a 7 year period and to compare these data to our previous findings. From January 1995 to December 2001, 1094 children with suspected allergic contact dermatitis were patch tested with our paediatric series of 30 substances. 404 were affected by atopic dermatitis. 570 children (52.1%), 300 girls and 270 boys, proved to be sensitized. Among them, 291 (51%) were polysensitized. Neomycin, nickel sulfate, wool alcohols, thimerosal, ammoniated mercury, and propolis gave the highest number of positive responses. No significant differences were observed in the prevalence of contact sensitization among the patients with atopic dermatitis and non atopics. However, in the latter the frequency of positive responses to nickel sulfate and Kathon CG was significantly lower than in the former. The face (25%), the hands (23%), and the flexural areas of the limbs (18%) were most frequently affected in children with positive patch tests. In this study population the frequency of sensitized children was significantly higher than the one found from 1988 to 1994, in particular for neomycin, nickel sulfate, wool alcohols, ammoniated mercury, propolis, potassium dichromate, mercaptobenzothiazole and thiuram mix. Our data demonstrate that contact sensitization is more and more frequent in children referring to our department and that the importance of some allergens, such as neomycin, wool alcohols, propolis and potassium dichromate, is increasing in the paediatric age with respect to previous results.

AB  - Summary A 22-year-old Friesian gelding was presented with a history of chronic, nonresolving lameness localised to the right front foot. Radiographs showed a smoothly marginated circular lucent area with a rim of increased opacity adjacent to the solar canal of the distal phalanx. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a reversed V-shaped smoothly demarcated space-occupying mass causing invagination of the solar laminae towards the solar canal arch and deformity of the adjacent surface of the distal phalanx. The mass was removed surgically and submitted for histopathology, which revealed a keratoma and periosteal fibrosis. Six weeks post-surgery the horse returned to the previous work level and 8 months follow-up showed no recurrence of keratoma. This report highlights the usefulness of MRI as a diagnostic modality for solar keratoma.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a dramatic shift in the overall oral health status of populations in the developed world: people are living longer and retaining more natural teeth into old age. While this can be viewed as a sign of improvement, this situation brings its own problems. The prevalence of caries, enamel erosion and chronic periodontal disease increases with age and, for the individual, the effects of these oral diseases also accumulate over time. New problems arise in consequence, for example the prevalence of dentine hypersensitivity increases as roots are exposed due to increasing gingival recession. Plaque control can become more difficult with increasingly complex restorations and calculus accumulates. There are also issues relevant to social confidence: tooth colour darkens with ageing, in terms of intrinsic colour and also extrinsic tooth stain, both of which can affect perception of overall loss of whiteness. In this overall context, the role of personal oral care products and daily oral hygiene routines becomes even more important. This review examines how oral health and condition of the mouth changes with age and describes the potential for modern day toothpastes to reduce unwanted effects that occur during the ageing process.

AB  - Summary Florid Cushing's syndrome (CS) may be due to severe hypercortisolemia (or synthetic glucocorticoid) presenting as an acute emergency requiring urgent intervention and appropriate management. The hemodynamic stabilization of the patient, and at the same time efforts to lower cortisol levels are the priority compared to the investigation of CS etiology. When the patient is stabilized, an effort to identify the source of CS and proceed to definitive treatment can be considered. However, these specific patients are at increased risk of a fatal outcome. Advances in the medical treatment of CS may improve the prognosis of this small subgroup of CS patients.
