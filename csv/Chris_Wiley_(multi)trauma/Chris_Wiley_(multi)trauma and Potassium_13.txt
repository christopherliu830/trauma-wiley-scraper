AB  - Background:? Cardiac arrhythmias are considered as one of the most important causes of mortality in patients on hemodialysis. Arrhythmias frequently occur in patients with chronic renal failure on regular hemodialysis with reported incidences varying from 30?48% of patients. These abnormalities can span from supraventricular to severe ventricular arrhythmia. There is an increased frequency of occurrence and clustering of arrhythmias around the dialysis time. Aim of the study:?To detect the difference between acetate and bicarbonate dialysis as regard to the type and frequency of arrhythmia in those patients. Study design:?This study was done on 20 male patients age 51?73, all have history of heart disease. Patients were divided into 2 equal groups using acetate in group 1 and bicarbonate in group 2. All patients were on regular hemodialysis (4 hours, thrice weekly). Careful history and clinical examination were done. Pre-dialysis investigations included serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphorus, serum albumin, hemoglobin, and arterial blood gases. Post-dialysis serum potassium and arterial blood gases were measured. ECG and forty-eight hours ambulatory monitor (Holter monitor)(before, during, and after hemodialysis, till the end of the dialysis day and throughout the following day) were performed. Results:?Group 1 showed significantly less post-dialysis supraventricular arrhythmias than in dialysis day (210.9?±?236 and 62.3?±?14.4), respectively. Significantly less ventricular arrhythmias in post-dialysis than in dialysis day (30.7?±?50.4, and 106.2?±?128.4), respectively. While in Group 2 there were insignificant differences regarding supraventricular arrhythmias (21.9?±?28.9 and 16.6?±?36.3) and ventricular arrhythmias (22.9?+?7.8 and 29.6?+?12.8) in dialysis day than in post-dialysis day. There was significantly higher frequency of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in the dialysis day in acetate hemodialysis in comparison to bicarbonate hemodialysis. Conclusion:?Bicarbonate hemodialysis is less arrhythmogenic in comparison to acetate hemodialysis and has better effect on the blood pH and greater degree of base repletion. Continuous ambulatory ECG recording (Holter) is a useful tool in detecting arrhythmias in dialysis patients.

AB  - Objectives: 1) Describe the clinical course and diagnostic findings of cats with histopathologic evidence of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 2) Identify risk factors for ALI/ARDS in cats. Animals: Sixty-five client-owned cats with moderate to severe interstitial pneumonia, pneumonitis or alveolitis consistent with ALI/ARDS on post-mortem examination and clinical evidence of respiratory compromise. Procedure: Retrospective evaluation of medical records, postmortem examination and radiographs. Results: Cats in this study tended to be middle aged (mean 6.5±4.9 years). They had a short duration of illness (median 4 days; range 0?120 days) and of dyspnea (median 1 day; range 1?7 days). On presentation, the cats were tachypneic (mean respiratory rate 53±23?bpm) and relatively bradycardic (mean heart rate 166±43?bpm). The majority of cats were dyspneic (n=39) at presentation; all others developed respiratory difficulties during hospitalization. The mean white blood cell count was within normal limits (14.6±14.0?k/?L); 8 cats had a leukocytosis and 7 were leucopenic. Clinical findings consistent with SIRS (n=39) and sepsis (n=10) were common. Thoracic radiographs were reviewed in 31 cats and alveolar disease was the most frequent pattern (105 lung lobes) followed by interstitial disease (86 lung lobes). No cat had normal thoracic radiographs throughout hospitalization. Underlying disease was not identified on post-mortem examination in 15 cats (23%), but in the remaining cats underlying diseases included infectious systemic disease (n=11), neoplasia (n=8), respiratory (n=8) and urinary (n=7) system disorders, acute pancreatitis (n=7), hepatic diseases (n=5), major trauma (n=4), sepsis (n=3), CNS (n=2) and other systems (n=5). Nine cats had more then one underlying process. Conclusions: This study describes a naturally-occurring syndrome of ALI/ARDS in cats analogous to that which occurs in dogs and humans. In cats, ALI/ARDS occurs as a sequela of a variety of underlying systemic diseases, but in approximately one-quarter of patients an underlying cause is not identified at necropsy. It is important to consider ALI/ARDS in systemically ill cats who become dyspneic; in cats with pulmonary disease with acute worsening of respiratory status and in cats with pulmonary infiltrates for which no other cause can be identified.

AB  - Summary Diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for most other geriatric emergencies. Deranged glycaemic control may be the first indication of an infection or other acute illness. The risk of severe hypoglycaemia increases with age, and symptoms may be atypical. Long-acting insulin or oral sulphonylureas can cause persistent hypoglycaemia. Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar syndrome is associated with potentially lethal dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. Complications include infection and thrombosis. Older patients are prone to disorders of thermoregulation due to extreme environmental conditions, medical conditions or medication. Hypothermia can be classified into mild, moderate and severe. Heat illness is less common in temperate climates but older patients are particularly vulnerable during heatwaves and as a result of sun-exposure.

AB  - Summary This chapter summarizes priorities and management of the patient with heart failure (HF) or decompensated chronic HF. Patients with suspected acute HF should have measurement of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP) at presentation. The finding of a normal level of plasma BNP or NT-pro-BNP effectively excludes HF. If the clinical/ECG features or natriuretic peptide level indicate acute HF or decompensated chronic HF, transthoracic echocardiography should be done within 48 hours of admission. HF may be caused by myocardial, valvular or pericardial disease, or metabolic disorders. Clinical assessment, ECG and echocardiography will usually identify the likely diagnosis. Further investigation (e.g. coronary angiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) may be needed for definitive diagnosis. HF due to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is categorized by the LV ejection fraction (EF) as HF with preserved EF, HF with reduced EF, and HF with mid-range EF.

AB  - SUMMARY Background Trauma is the leading cause of death in children >1 year of age, with haemorrhage as the most common cause of medically preventable deaths. While massive transfusion protocols (MTPs) have been investigated and used in adults to reduce death from haemorrhage, there are a paucity of published data on MTP practices and outcomes in children. This study aimed to survey current MTP policies and the frequency of activation at paediatric care centres. Study design and methods We conducted a survey of MTPs at hospitals in the United States and Canada, including children's general hospitals, children's specialty hospitals and children's units in general hospitals. We collected information on how the MTP is activated, what therapeutics are given, frequency of its use, and how it is audited for compliance. Results Forty-six survey responses were analysed. Physician discretion was the most common activation criteria (89%). A majority of sites (78%) targeted a ?high? (≥1 : 2) ratio of plasma to red blood cells (RBC). Fifteen percent of sites use antifibrinolytics in their MTPs. Eighty nine percent of sites have type-O RBC units and 48% of sites had thawed plasma units stored in an immediately available location. Conclusion There is a wide variation in MTPs among paediatric hospitals with regard to both activation criteria and products administered. This underscores the need for future prospective studies to determine the most effective resuscitation methods for paediatric populations to improve outcomes and therapeutic safety for massive bleeding.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2010) 115, 92?101. Abstract Prolonged seizures activate members of the Bcl-2 homology domain 3-only sub-group of the Bcl-2 protein family, which are essential for initiation of apoptosis signaling. Bid is a potent pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology domain 3-only protein, which upon proteolytic activation translocates to mitochondria to promote activation of the Bax/Bak sub-group of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family and thereby contributes to release of apoptogenic molecules, such as cytochrome c and possibly apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Bid-deficient mice have been reported to show reduced lesion volumes after ischemia and trauma in vivo but a causal role for Bid in the setting of seizure-induced neuronal death has not been investigated. In this study, we studied Bid activation following status epilepticus in mice and compared hippocampal damage between wild-type and Bid-deficient animals. Full-length Bid was detected in normal mouse hippocampus and the cleaved (activated) p15 fragment of Bid was detected shortly after status epilepticus. Bid-deficient mice underwent equivalent electrographic seizure responses during status epilepticus as wild-type animals. Hippocampal counts of degenerating neurons and surviving neuron-specific nuclear protein-positive cells were not significantly different between wild-type and Bid-deficient mice. Additionally, nuclear translocation of AIF was not reduced in Bid-deficient compared with wild-type animals subjected to status epilepticus. The present study demonstrates that AIF is not dependent on Bid for mitochondrial release and nuclear import in this model and that while Bid is cleaved during seizure-induced neuronal death, it may be functionally redundant or even not essential.

AB  - Abstract Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient required for the activity of metalloenzymes. It is an essential component of parenteral nutrition (PN), but requirements are low. Mn status is difficult to assess, with the commonest method being measurement of its concentration in whole blood. This method has limitations, including artifactually high concentrations resulting from contamination of specimen tubes. Mn toxicity is a well-recognized complication of PN, the risk of which increases if there is cholestasis or if the patient has received high doses. It usually presents with parkinsonian-like symptoms but may be detected presymptomatically as hypermanganesemia or as increased signal intensity of the basal ganglia upon T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Caution is necessary when providing Mn for patients on long-term PN (>1 month). It is advisable to withhold supplementation if hypermanganesemia or cholestasis develops. Deficiency of Mn is rare in patients treated with PN. PN regimens are contaminated with Mn in amounts likely to meet requirements. Consequently, it is debated whether PN should be routinely supplemented with Mn. The currently recommended dose of Mn in adults treated with PN is 55 ?g/d, but the doses provided by most currently available multi?trace element products exceed this. In response to calls for new products to be developed, 2 new multi?trace element products are currently available in Europe that provide Mn doses of 55 ?g/d. Once these products are in general use, it is likely that the incidence of Mn toxicity will decrease.

AB  - ABSTRACT Renal amyloidosis was diagnosed in six related English foxhounds from two separate hunting kennels. There was no apparent age or sex predilection. All the dogs had clinical and laboratory findings compatible with renal disease. The onset of clinical signs was acute in all cases with death or euthanasia in five of the six affected dogs occurring within one week of presentation. The remaining dog was treated with diuresis which produced a temporary improvement. Histological examination of renal tissue from affected dogs identified the presence of both glomerular and interstitial amyloid, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining to be of the reactive type (amyloid A). There were occasional sclerosed glomeruli or glomeruli with thickened Bowman's capsules, in addition to interstitial and periglomerular infiltration with a predominance of plasma cells and lymphocytes and secondary changes including tubular eosinophilic casts. Renal papillary necrosis was identified in three dogs. One hound had concurrent multicentric lymphoma. Pedigree analysis of the affected dogs revealed that four individuals shared a common great grandsire and that the same dog was the grand-sire of a further case. Pedigree analysis of five additional dogs from one of the kennels, all of which had clinical signs of acute renal failure but from which renal tissue was not available, revealed a close relationship to those foxhounds with confirmed renal amyloidosis.

AB  - Alcohol abuse causes impairment of cognitive function ranging from mild forms to end-stage dementia. Alcohol-related dementia accounts for nearly 20% of all admissions to state mental hospitals and may result from head trauma, thiamine deficiency, Alzheimer's, and other brain diseases that can be diagnosed conclusively only at autopsy. However, we postulate that after all these conditions have been excluded, an ?alcohol encephalopathy? remains. This is characterized by impaired synaptic function, which underlies the continuum of impaired intellectual function. We found in 79 histologically normal brains of a nondemented general hospital population a 40% decrease in the density of cholinergic muscarinic receptors in the frontal cortex of alcoholics when compared with matched controls of the same age. Only alcohol abuse and not aging, postmortem changes, medications, clinical (including liver) diseases, or differences in causes of death could account for this loss.

AB  - Summary The quality of donor organs will determine the quality of life for the recipient and the importance of optimal management of the multi-organ donor is that the organs may benefit up to five, critically ill, patients. The basic principle is to maintain sufficient preload to minimise the need for inotropic support and it is recommended that all multiple organ donors should have central venous and arterial pressure monitoring in addition to adequate venous access. The importance of the choice of fluid for volume expansion and the management of the hormonal disturbances which follow brain death are considered.

AB  - Mucinous metaplasia occurs uncommonly in cutaneous pathology, usually at specialized anatomic locations (genitalia, palms, soles) and within restricted pathologic contexts (inflammation, trauma). Here we report a unique case of eccrine mucinous metaplasia associated with an apocrine cystadenoma. A 13-year-old girl had an asymptomatic, 4-mm nodule on the chest. Histopathology demonstrated a typical apocrine cystadenoma in the upper and middle dermis. Adjacent to this neoplasm was a cluster of coiled eccrine secretory ducts, of which the inner layer was almost entirely replaced by benign-appearing cells containing abundant, non-sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides. At eight months? follow-up, there was no recurrence. Our case demonstrates that, very uncommonly, mucinous metaplasia may be associated with a pathogenetically separate, adjacent neoplasm, in this instance an apocrine cystadenoma.

AB  - Hypoalbuminemia and decreased colloid osmotic pressure (COP) are common in critically ill dogs. Hypoalbuminemia has been shown to negatively impact outcome. Treatment strategies to raise COP include the use of both natural and synthetic colloids. To date there is no comprehensive evaluation of human albumin (HA) use in dogs. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the use of 25% HA in critically ill dogs. The medical records of all dogs receiving HA between January 2003 and March 2004 were reviewed using a standardized data sheet for signalment, diagnoses, Survival Prediction Index (SPI), dose of HA administered, amount of crystalloid fluid administered prior to HA administration, length of hospitalization (LOH), complications, and outcome. Additionally pre- and post-HA administration values for serum albumin (SA), blood COP, and total solids (TS) were evaluated. Thirty-seven dogs received HA. Thirty of the 37 dogs (81%) underwent surgery and 13 of 37 (39%) dogs were diagnosed with septic peritonitis. Other diagnoses included trauma, wounds, neoplasia, gastric ulcer, and pancreatitis. The median SPI of all dogs was 0.53 (range 0.06?0.82). Median dose of HA used was 1.5?g/kg (range 0.38?3.64?g/kg). Median dose of crystalloid fluids administered prior to HA administration was 6.23?ml/kg/hr (range 1.2?45.4?ml/kg/hr). Median LOH was 5 days (range 1?16 days). Mild complications were encountered in 9 of 37 (24%) dogs and included prolonged clotting times (n=3), increased breathing effort (n=3), vomiting (n=2), and fever (n=1). Of the 37 dogs in the study, 21 (57%) survived, 10 (27%) died, and 6 (16%) were euthanized. After HA administration, median SA increased from 1.5?g/dl (range 1.0?2.1?g/dl) to 2.8?g/dl (range 1.5?4.4?g/dl) (p<0.001), median COP increased from 11?mmHg (range 6.8?13.8?mmHg) to 14.4?mmHg (range 11?26.9?mmHg) (p<0.001), and median TS increased from 2.9?g/dl (range 0.9?4.6?g/dl) to 4.0 (range 2.8?6.2) (p<0.001). When compared to non-survivors, survivors had higher post-HA administration SA (p=0.008), higher net COP increase (p=0.032), and received higher dosages of HA (p=0.046). Pre-treatment SA, COP, or the development of complications during administration did not impact LOH or outcome. In this retrospective study, HA administration effectively increased SA, TS and COP in critically ill dogs and was associated with relatively few complications. Future studies are warranted to further evaluate the potential benefits of HA administration.

AB  - Case A 65-year-old arteriopath with a history of myocardial infarction 5 months previously presented with classical signs of mesenteric infarction that led to a right hemicolectomy with an end ileostomy. Outcome Postoperative complications occurred due to unusually large volume ileostomy output in the subsequent 4 weeks, resulting in severe volume depletion and the sequelae that required intensive care support. These were triggered and prolonged by two episodes of intra-abdominal sepsis. Conclusions Sepsis-induced high ileostomy output following intestinal resection for non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia is a serious complication. Early restoration of intestinal continuity following bowel resection for established infarction may prevent this complication.
