AB  - The clinical challenge in acute injury as in traumatic brain injury (TBI) is to halt the delayed neuronal loss that occurs hours and days after the insult. Here we report that the activation of CREB-dependent transcription in reactive astrocytes prevents secondary injury in cerebral cortex after experimental TBI. The study was performed in a novel bitransgenic mouse in which a constitutively active CREB, VP16-CREB, was targeted to astrocytes with the Tet-Off system. Using histochemistry, qPCR, and gene profiling we found less neuronal death and damage, reduced macrophage infiltration, preserved mitochondria, and rescued expression of genes related to mitochondrial metabolism in bitransgenic mice as compared to wild type littermates. Finally, with meta-analyses using publicly available databases we identified a core set of VP16-CREB candidate target genes that may account for the neuroprotective effect. Enhancing CREB activity in astrocytes thus emerges as a novel avenue in acute brain post-injury therapeutics. GLIA 2016;64:853?874

AB  - Introduction: The biochemical consequence of acute obstructive uropathy can alter the hemodynamic profile. The objectives of this study were to determine the arterial blood pressure at presentation of male cats with acute urethral obstruction and to correlate these measurements with concurrent metabolic abnormalities. Study Design: Prospective research study in a private small animal after-hours emergency clinic. The subjects were client owned male cats presented with acute urethral obstruction and no other known concurrent disease. Measurements: Indirect oscillometric blood pressure measurements of urethral obstructed male cats were obtained at admission prior to blood sampling and treatment. Data recorded and studied: mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), physical examination parameters, serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, potassium, phosphorus, total calcium and magnesium concentration, venous pH, electrocardiogram lead II, and urine volume in bladder. Results: Twenty-eight cats were included in the study. Using normal values for MAP in cats, the results fell into 2 groups: normotensive (MAP 90?140?mmHg) and hypertensive (MAP>140?mmHg). Seventy-one percent (20/28) were considered normotensive (mean 113±14.6?mmHg). Twenty-nine percent (8/28) were considered hypertensive (mean 154±9.8?mmHg). In the normotensive group, the mean body temperature was 37.6±1.5°C, the mean heart rate was 179±42.2/min, and 64% (9/20) had an abnormal cardiac rhythm. In the hypertensive group, the mean body temperature was 38.3±0.6°C, the mean heart rate was 219±18.0/min, and all had normal cardiac rhythm. In the normotensive group, the serum biochemical abnormalities were more severe. Sixty percent of the normotensive casts (12/20) were azotemic (BUN>34?mg/dl) with a mean of 114±95.2; 58% (11/19) were hypercreatinemic (>2.2?mg/dl) with a mean of 8.9±7.9, and 55% (11/20) were hyperkalemic (>4.2?mEq/L) (mean 6.2±7.9). Within the hypertensive cats group, 50% (4/8) were mildly azotemic (BUN ? mean 49±24.4?mg/dl); 50% (4/8) were hypercreatinemic (mean 2.9±1.95?mg/dl), and only 1/8 was hyperkalemic (mean 3.9±0.6 mEq/L). The volume of urine in the bladder at the time of presentation did not seem to be significantly different between the 2 groups (94.7±57.1?ml in the normotensive group vs. 83.8±26.7?ml in the hypertensive group). Conclusions: The results suggest that cats with acute urethral obstruction and a normal mean arterial pressure at presentation were more likely to have severe azotemia, hypercreatinemia and hyperkalemia.

AB  - Abstract Background Prolonged postoperative ileus (PPOI) is a common complication after abdominal surgery, but data about risk factors of PPOI for patients with gastric cancer are rare. We sought to investigate the impact of laparoscopic versus open surgery for PPOI after gastric cancer surgery. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a registry database consecutively collected from June 2016 to March 2017. PPOI was defined as no bowel function persisting for more than 4 days. Univariate analysis and multiple logistic regression models were performed to investigate risk factors, and stratified analysis was carried out to examine the primary association at different levels of a potential confounding factor. Results A total of 162 patients composed of 63 patients undergoing laparotomy and 99 patients undergoing laparoscopy were enrolled and PPOI was observed in 32 (19.75%) patients. Risk factors significantly correlated with PPOI were as follows: open surgery, older age, late surgical pathologic staging, postoperative use of opioid analgesic, low level of postoperative albumin and serum potassium. Compared to open surgery, the laparoscopic surgery was a strong protective factor for PPOI after adjusting related variables (OR = 0.17, CI: 0.05-0.52, P = .002). There was an interaction between surgical methods and the postoperative WBC level (P for interaction = .007). In the two group stratified analysis of WBC, laparoscopic surgery had a significant lower risk of PPOI than open group for the patients with WBC counts above the middle level in crude or adjusted models. This result remained significantly in the three group stratified analysis for the patients with WBC counts in the middle and or high tertile groups. Conclusions PPOI is a common postoperative complication of patients after gastrectomy. Laparoscopic surgery is associated with decreased risk of PPOI in gastric surgery. Patients who underwent open surgery and presented with high level of WBC should be cautious with PPOI.

AB  - Summary All diseases, including neurological diseases, can be broadly defined as homeostatic failures. Neuroglial cells are a major component of pathogenesis of neurological diseases. The function of neuroglia is neuroprotection. In neurological diseases, glia attempt to maintain tissue and cellular homeostasis. Reactive astrogliosis can be defined as a constitutive, graded, multi-stage and evolutionary conserved defensive astroglial reaction. It can be classified according to (a) morphological appearances, and (b) severity. This chapter focuses on Wallerian degeneration which is currently used to describe axonal degeneration in both CNS and PNS. Wallerian degeneration is a specialised active process that involves activation of localised signals in both axons and surrounding glial cells. The chapter dicusses excitotoxic vulnerability of oligodendrocytes. The main function of microglia is to detect insults to the CNS and to mount a defensive response, the activation of microglia. The activated microglia can change the repertoire and levels of expression of numerous receptors.

AB  - Abstract Magnetic resonance (MR; synonymous with NMR = nuclear magnetic resonance) is a universal physical technique best known for non-invasive detection and anatomical mapping of water protons (H). MR-spectroscopy (MRS) records protons from tissue chemicals other than water, intrinsic phosphorus containing metabolites, sodium, potassium, carbon, nitrogen, and fluorine. MRS is therefore an imaging technique with the potential to record human and animal biochemistry in vivo. As a result of wide availability of MRI equipment in research laboratories and hospitals, MRS is a serious competitor with PET to define normal body composition and its perturbation by pharmacological and pathological events. This article describes practical aspects of in vivo MRS with particular emphasis on the brain, where novel metabolites have been described. A survey of these new aspects of neurochemistry emphasize their practical utility as neuronal and axonal markers, measures of energy status, membrane constituents, and osmolytes, as well as some xenobiotics, such as alcohol. The concept of multinuclear in vivo MRS is illustrated by diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of several human brain disorders. Although these methods are currently most frequently encountered in human studies, as well as with transgenic and knockout mouse models, MRS adds a new dimension to anatomic and histopathologic descriptions.

AB  - Background The present interdisciplinary consensus review proposes clinical considerations and recommendations for anaesthetic practice in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery with an Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) programme. Methods Studies were selected with particular attention being paid to meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials and large prospective cohort studies. For each item of the perioperative treatment pathway, available English-language literature was examined and reviewed. The group reached a consensus recommendation after critical appraisal of the literature. Results This consensus statement demonstrates that anaesthesiologists control several preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative ERAS elements. Further research is needed to verify the strength of these recommendations. Conclusions Based on the evidence available for each element of perioperative care pathways, the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS ?) Society presents a comprehensive consensus review, clinical considerations and recommendations for anaesthesia care in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery within an ERAS programme. This unified protocol facilitates involvement of anaesthesiologists in the implementation of the ERAS programmes and allows for comparison between centres and it eventually might facilitate the design of multi-institutional prospective and adequately powered randomized trials.

AB  - Acepromazine (ACE) is a phenothiazine derivative used for its sedative properties. The primary mechanism of action of ACE is through inhibition of dopaminergic-2 receptors in the brain. It is a common belief that ACE lowers the seizure threshold. The purpose of this clinical study is to retrospectively evaluate the occurrence of seizures in dogs presenting with a history of seizures that were treated with ACE during hospitalization. A retrospective review of records from dogs that had a chronic or acute seizure history and received ACE was done. Factors evaluated included the presenting complaint, historical seizure information, ACE dosage and route of administration, reason for giving and length of hospitalization following ACE, occurrence of seizure activity post-ACE administration, time interval between ACE and seizure activity, and use of other medications. Thirty-one dogs qualified for the study, 20 males and 11 females. Age range was 3 months - 14.9 years. Presenting complaint was seizure in 28 patients, bite wound in 1 patient, ruptured cranial cruciate ligament in 1 patient, and hind limb paresis in 1 patient. Twenty-seven dogs did not seize after ACE administration within an average of 16.4 hours of observation (range: 0.25?66 hours). There was a known history of seizures in 22/31 prior to the day of presentation, and 15/22 were currently on maintenance anti-epileptic medication. Of the 16 not on anti-seizure medication at the time of presentation, 13 were started on phenobarbital. One was also started on potassium bromide, and 3 received no anti-seizure medication during hospitalization. All received at least one dose of ACE while in the hospital (range 1?5). Mean ACE dose was 0.029?mg/kg IV (range: 0.008?0.057?mg/kg; n=46), 0.036?mg/kg IM (range: 0.017?0.059?mg/kg; n=14), 0.53?mg/kg PO (n=2). Twenty-three received some form of anti-seizure medication in the hospital prior to being given ACE. Eight seizure episodes occurred 0.3?10 hours after ACE administration in 4. All 4 presented for seizures. The time interval between ACE administration and seizure activity was greater than that expected for measurable effects to be seen in one dog (10 hours). In conclusion, there is no clinical evidence that ACE administration at the listed dosages is associated with increased seizure activity in dogs with seizure disorders. A larger study group is needed to more thoroughly evaluate the safety of short-term ACE use in dogs with a seizure history.

AB  - ABSTRACT Diabetic ketoacidosis is a common medical emergency and may represent up to 14% of all diabetic admissions with an annual incidence of about 4.6 cases per 1,000 diabetics per year. A spectrum of disease is encountered and mortality rates vary in different series from 1.9% to 15%. The pathogenesis of diabetic ketoacidosis is discussed in detail with particular emphasis on interpretation of biochemistry results and on fluid and electrolyte resuscitation. A flexible approach to fluid resuscitation, careful interpretation of biochemistry results, and close monitoring should be combined with other standard aspects of management such as titratable insulin infusions and early treatment of identifiable precipitants in order to minimise morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Abstract Man has used hallucinogenic plants and mushrooms for centuries. The characteristics of these plants that led to their incorporation into important ritualistic and spiritual traditions, however, have also resulted in their widespread propagation and abuse. Hallucinogenic plants have long been depicted as innocuous substances, yet their unpredictable nature makes intoxication potentially dangerous. In present-day society, there is greater access to these drugs and a growing trend among the younger generations to experiment with these plants in a recreational fashion. Emergency physicians need to be aware of the potential sources of plant hallucinogens and the spectrum of toxic effects. A review of the more common hallucinogenic plants and fungi is discussed with reference to historical, pharmacological and clinical aspects of these intoxications.

AB  - Multiday endurance sports expose athletes to multiple physical stressors. Little is known about the athletes? physiological responses to these stressors. A detailed understanding of the serological changes that occur during competition may improve the treatment of athletes suffering from illness or injury. This prospective, observational study aimed to characterize serological changes in AR athletes across multiday competition. Athletes underwent venipuncture at the start, midpoint, and end of a 5-day, multidiscipline event. A variety of serological and inflammatory factors was measured and then analyzed to describe their changes over the course of the race. A total of 27 AR athletes (29.6% female, 70.4% male) met inclusion criteria out of 33 recruited initially. The mean age was 37.7 (IQR 32.5, 41). The median race time for athletes was 133 hours (IQR 123, 142). Serum creatinine, sodium, and potassium tended to remain stable as the race progressed. Conversely, serological measures, including hemoglobin, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein levels, tended to change substantially during the race. Participants demonstrated the ability to maintain homeostasis, despite significant physiological threat. Renal function, electrolyte balance, and hormonal profiles were stable. However, a pro-inflammatory response and decrease in red cell availability were evident by the midpoint of the race.

AB  - Summary Topical treatments have been used in wound care for centuries. Many of the treatments, however, have not ? or only to a very limited degree ? undergone scientific scrutiny. This is especially true for many of the products that are available over the counter. Determining the contents of many of these products can be difficult, and as a rule of thumb, products without a list of ingredients should not be used on wounds. In contrast, effects of wound cleansers and solutions used for irrigation have been investigated in several studies. Although cleansers and antiseptics had, for some years, fallen out of favor due to their detrimental effects on cells cultured in vitro, current best evidence suggests that they may be of benefit if used judiciously. The negative impact on cell cultures has, in many studies, not been replicated when the products were used in vivo. Use of antiseptics on heavily contaminated or infected wounds seems to enhance healing through a reduction of the wound's bioburden.

AB  - Summary Ascites is the most common complication of cirrhosis resulting in poor quality of life, high risk of development of other complications of cirrhosis, increased morbidity and mortality associated with surgical interventions, and poor long-term outcome. The practical management of ascites involves a proper evaluation of the patient with a thorough history and physical exam. In addition, complete laboratory, ascitic fluid, radiological, endoscopic, and in some cases histological tests should be performed. Taking proper care of patients with ascites can be challenging because they are prone to several complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hypervolemic hyponatremia, hepatic hydrothorax, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and hepatocellular carcinoma, bleeding from esophageal or gastric varices, and hepatic encephalopathy. While the initial management of uncomplicated ascites with low-sodium diet and diuretic treatment is straightforward in the majority of patients, there is a group of patients that fail to respond to diuretics and become a real therapeutic challenge.

AB  - An 8-year-old Pêga breed donkey that presented with a history of persistent enlargement of the right leg was diagnosed with a rhabdomyosarcoma by surgical exploration and biopsy. The tumoral mass involved the medial and posterior aspects of the thigh. At presentation, the donkey was extremely painful and reluctant to walk. Initial physical examination showed a heart rate of 60 beats/min, respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min, and a rectal temperature of 100.2°F. Venous blood was collected for a CBC and biochemistry. Postoperative care included antibiotic (potassium penicillin and gentamicin) and anti-inflammatory (phenylbutazone and dexamethasone). The donkey was very painful in the immediate postoperative period and developed dehiscence of the incision. It was unable to bear weight on the affected limb, very reluctant to walk, and lying down in sternal recumbency most of the time. Heart and respiratory rates ranged from 60 to 90 and 20 to 32, respectively. Because of the poor prognosis, euthanasia was indicated but the owner decided to keep the donkey alive to try semen collection. In order to improve life quality and making the semen collection possible, the anti-inflammatory therapy was stopped and an analgesic therapy with epidural opioids was selected. A 20-gauge epidural catheter was inserted in the first intercoccygeal space through an epidural Huber point needle. With the purpose of reaching the lumbosacral area, 20?cm of the catheter was advanced cranially from the needle tip. During 3 days, a combination of morphine (0.1?mg/kg) and tramadol (0.5?mg/kg) was administered daily with a total volume of 20?ml. During the first 24 hours after the first administration, heart rate ranged from 62 to 64 and respiratory rate from 20 to 24. It was not observed to have any adverse effect. The donkey improved during treatment standing most of the time and eating better. It was easier to hand walk, although it was not completely able to bear weight in the affected limb. Even during treatment, the donkey reacted intensely when the surgical area in the caudal aspect of the thigh was manipulated. On the forth day, it tried to copulate and semen was successfully collected by manipulation of the penis. As the semen was not classified as good enough to be frozen, the donkey was euthanatized. On post-mortem examination, the position of the catheter in the epidural canal was observed and 20?ml of methylene blue solution injected through the catheter before euthanasia. It was enough to totally stain the segment of epidural canal from the first intercoccygeal space to the lumbosacral joint. The opioid epidural analgesic therapy reported here was considered to be efficient to treat the painful condition of the donkey, but it was not able to completely abolish the pain.

AB  - Ticks are ectoparasites that cause dermatologic disease both directly through physical trauma to the skin, salivary secretions, or remnant body parts, and indirectly through transmission of disease. Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, and babesiosis are known tick-transmitted diseases. The histopathology related to a primary tick bite, similar to other arthropod bites, classically consists of a perivascular infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils, histiocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils in varying amounts. We describe five patients with a novel histologic reaction to embedded tick parts., Each case demonstrates a thrombotic vasculopathy consisting of intraluminal eosinophilic deposits that stain strongly with Periodic acid Schiff stain. The adjacent tissue shows dermal necrosis with surrounding interstitial to diffuse dermal neutrophilic inflammation. We postulate that diffuse dermal nutrophilic infiltrates in association with thrombogenic vasculopathy is an unusual histologic picture of tick bite reactions that may be attributable to remnant tick parts.
