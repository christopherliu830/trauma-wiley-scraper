AB  - Summary Right recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN) is an uncommon, acquired disease for which the aetiology can frequently be diagnosed. Numerous aetiologies have been proposed for right-sided RLN which comprises 2% of all cases of RLN. In this report we discuss the clinical course, treatment and outcome following right-sided laryngeal paralysis as a complication of left-sided prosthetic laryngoplasty in a horse. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of such a surgical complication.

AB  - The production of jewellery is currently mostly industrial and the jewellers perform only one or two stages in the manufacturing process. The jewellers make jewellery by hand in small workshops and are more polyvalent: they shape the metal with pliers or hand tools or cast it in moulds, assemble the individual parts with glues, carve metal, diamonds and other stones, clean metals with soaps and ultrasonic baths. The occupational dermatitis is of irritant nature (acid and alkalis in metal cleaners, soaps, detergents, metal dust, abrasions from polishing wheels and emery paper, heat, adhesives, etc) and allergic nature (potassium dichromate, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, ammoniated mercury, carba mix, epoxy resin, mercapto mix, formaldehyde, nickel, colophony). We report the cases of two jewellers working in workshops. A 47 year old atopic woman already known for a sensitivity to metals (nickel, potassium dichromate and cobalt) developed recurrent vesiculo-pustular erythematous lesions of both palms with occasional infections treated with systemic antibiotics and topical steroids. Patch tests were performed for the European standard series, woods, and personal series. There were positive?+?reactions at 96?h to colophony, palladium, and personal waxes. Information obtained through the manufacturer revealed colophony in the waxes frequently used by jewellers to fix the precious stones to woods and metal allowing the stones to be carved. A 47 years old atopic man working as a jeweller for 32 years developed recurrent eczematous lesions of the fingers of the right hand. Patch tests were performed for the European standard series, preservatives, plastics, acrylates and personals series and were positive?+?+?at 96?h for urea formaldehyde, diethylenetriamine, araldite hardener and the soap used to clean the jewels. Uncommonly this contact allergy is not due to the epoxy resins themselves but to the hardener. The urea formaldehyde and the diethylenetriamine are in fact used as epoxy resins hardeners. There were no reactions to the araldite resin but there was one to its hardener. In conclusion we report two unusual cases of hand contact dermatitis in jewellers. Because jewellers are exposed to a variety of substances, to detect the allergens the inquiry must be accurate and extensive patch testing may be required. Common allergens are compounds of uncommon substances and tools and uncommon allergens are compounds of well-known sensitizers.

AB  - Ticks are ectoparasites that cause dermatologic disease both directly through physical trauma to the skin, salivary secretions, or remnant body parts, and indirectly through transmission of disease. Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, and babesiosis are known tick-transmitted diseases. The histopathology related to a primary tick bite, similar to other arthropod bites, classically consists of a perivascular infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils, histiocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils in varying amounts. We describe five patients with a novel histologic reaction to embedded tick parts., Each case demonstrates a thrombotic vasculopathy consisting of intraluminal eosinophilic deposits that stain strongly with Periodic acid Schiff stain. The adjacent tissue shows dermal necrosis with surrounding interstitial to diffuse dermal neutrophilic inflammation. We postulate that diffuse dermal nutrophilic infiltrates in association with thrombogenic vasculopathy is an unusual histologic picture of tick bite reactions that may be attributable to remnant tick parts.

AB  - Abstract Mycotic keratitis (an infection of the cornea) is an important ocular infection, especially in young male outdoor workers. There are two frequent presentations: keratitis due to filamentous fungi (Fusarium, Aspergillus, phaeohyphomycetes and Scedosporium apiospermum are frequent causes) and keratitis due to yeast-like fungi (Candida albicans and other Candida species). In the former, trauma is usually the sole predisposing factor, although previous use of corticosteroids and contact lens wear are gaining importance as risk factors; in the latter, there is usually some systemic or local (ocular) defect. The clinical presentation and clinical features may suggest a diagnosis of mycotic keratitis; increasingly, in vivo (non-invasive) imaging techniques (confocal microscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography) are also being used for diagnosis. However, microbiological investigations, particularly direct microscopic examination and culture of corneal scrape or biopsy material, still form the cornerstone of diagnosis. In recent years, the PCR has gained prominence as a diagnostic aid for mycotic keratitis, being used to complement microbiological methods; more importantly, this molecular method permits rapid specific identification of the aetiological agent. Although various antifungal compounds have been used for therapy, management of this condition (particularly if deep lesions occur) continues to be problematic; topical natamycin and, increasingly, voriconazole (given by various routes) are key therapeutic agents. Therapeutic surgery, such as therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty, is needed when medical therapy fails. Increased awareness of the importance of this condition is likely to spur future research initiatives.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses asepsis and infection controls in surgical practice. Proper preparation of the surgical patient is a critical step in the surgical case and is related to the outcome and subsequent potential infection of the surgical site. Improper patient preparation can have catastrophic consequences for the surgical procedure and incision integrity. Surgical prep of veterinary patients consists of two steps: clipping (removal) of the hair/fur and skin cleansing with an antiseptic. Once the patient has received the initial prep, they are ready to be transported to the operating room. Proper positioning of the patient is a critical step in the patient prep process. Surgeons require the patient be positioned in a straight and anatomically correct fashion. Efficient use of specialize veterinary surgical instrumentation requires those using it to understand proper application, handling, care, and troubleshooting. Surgical grade instruments are generally made from stainless steel and other metal alloys such as carbon and chromium.

AB  - Summary The aim of wound management is to optimize healing in an effort to return the horse to its previous function as rapidly as possible, while respecting the financial constraints of the owner. Infection, with its associated excessive or inappropriate inflammation, is the single most likely cause of delayed healing of wounds healing by second intention. Effective wound preparation, exploration, cleansing via irrigation, and debridement are central to reducing the incidence of infection and promoting uncomplicated healing of accidental wounds. Antimicrobial drugs should be used only when there is clinical evidence of infection or when development of an infection would be life-threatening or career-ending for the patient. Although empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy may be used initially, definitive selection of antimicrobial drugs should be based on the results of bacterial culture and sensitivity testing of isolates. The use of antimicrobial drugs in surgical wounds should never replace aseptic and atraumatic surgical technique. Where there is evidence of formation of biofilm, repeat debridement and topical administration of antimicrobial drugs should be central to any treatment plan.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Dermatophytosis is a contagious and zoonotic skin disease that spreads easily between individuals of the same species and across species. This paper describes its pathogenesis, with specific reference to the host and environmental factors, which predispose cats to infections. The clinical signs in cats can mimic almost any dermatological disease and include alopecia, scaling, comedones, erythema, hyperpigmentation, follicular casts, lichenification, miliary dermatitis and eosinophilic granuloma complex. Sample taking and the range of diagnostic tests available to confirm the diagnosis are described. The paper also highlights the need for the treatment of the in-contact pets and the environment, as well as the affected animal.

AB  - Abstract The Lions Eye Bank of South Australia was established six years ago and has collected corneas from 790 donors. The consent rate is currently 82% of requests made. Two-thirds of donors have been male, with mean donor age/year varying from 54 to 64 years (range two to 93 years). Cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, trauma and haemorrhage account for 80% of all donor deaths. Mean death to enucleation time is five hours. Corneas assessed as being of excellent or very good quality are released preferentially from the bank; those with central endothelial cell counts of less than 1500 cells/mm2 are discarded. Fewer than 1% of donors have returned a positive result for HIV or hepatitis B. Of the 1580 corneas collected by the bank, 863 (55%) have been used for transplantation with a primary non-function rate of 0.46%. The evolving policies, logistics of operation and methodologies employed by the bank are described in detail.

AB  - AbstractThe heat shock response (HSR) is an ancient and highly conserved process that is essential for coping with environmental stresses, including extremes of temperature. Fever is a more recently evolved response, during which organisms temporarily subject themselves to thermal stress in the face of infections. We review the phylogenetically conserved mechanisms that regulate fever and discuss the effects that febrile-range temperatures have on multiple biological processes involved in host defense and cell death and survival, including the HSR and its implications for patients with severe sepsis, trauma, and other acute systemic inflammatory states. Heat shock factor-1, a heat-induced transcriptional enhancer is not only the central regulator of the HSR but also regulates expression of pivotal cytokines and early response genes. Febrile-range temperatures exert additional immunomodulatory effects by activating mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades and accelerating apoptosis in some cell types. This results in accelerated pathogen clearance, but increased collateral tissue injury, thus the net effect of exposure to febrile range temperature depends in part on the site and nature of the pathologic process and the specific treatment provided. ? 2014 American Physiological Society.

Each method has distinct morphological and biochemical characteristics. Distinguishing between apoptosis and necrosis depends selection of appropriate assays and proper timing. This unit provides an extensive series of assays that measure membrane integrity, cell size and DNA content, state of chromatin, DNA fragmentation, and caspase activation. The results of these assays allow one to distinguish between apoptosis and necrosis.

AB  - Summary Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are frequently encountered in hospitalized patients with diabetes and/or hyperglycemia. AKI and CKD are important risk factors for hypoglycemia, if these patients are treated with sulfonylureas and/or insulin. Common reasons include decreased insulin clearance, reduced gluconeogenesis, gastroparesis, hypoglycemic unawareness, and decreased food intake due to poor appetite or lack of timely access to food. Current guidelines generally recommend avoiding certain non-insulin agents in the inpatient setting, and using intravenous insulin (Â± subcutaneous [SC] basal insulin); or SC basal insulin (Â± nutritional/correction insulin). Patients with diabetes and renal insufficiency are known to have decreased insulin requirements and a specific approach for insulin dosing in this population of hospitalized patients is needed to minimize the incidence of hypoglycemia. In addition, knowledge of which non-insulin glucose-lowering agents can be used safely and effectively for this population in the in-hospital setting is also considered.

General guidelines regarding judicious use of AMDs in equine patients have been developed by the American Association of Equine Practitioners. Detailed guidelines for AMD use in specific equine diseases supported by clinical trials and results of surveillance studies focused on resistance among equine bacterial pathogens are lacking. Studies that could lead to detailed and justifiable use recommendations would allow the equine practitioner to make more informed decisions regarding when to use AMDs, which drugs should be used and how they should be used (e.g. dose, route and duration).

AB  - Abstract Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare, aggressive, soft-tissue infection that results in necrosis of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia. It spreads rapidly and may progress to sepsis, multi-organ failure, and death. Predisposing conditions include diabetes, chronic alcoholism, advanced age, vascular disease, and immunosuppression and many cases are preceded by an injury or invasive procedure. Necrotizing soft-tissue infection of the breast is uncommon, with only a few reported cases in the literature. We present a 53-year-old diabetic woman who presented to the emergency room with several weeks of worsening breast and shoulder pain, swelling, and erythema. Upon formal evaluation by the surgical service, a necrotizing soft-tissue infection was suspected, and the patient was scheduled for emergent, surgical debridement. Because of the aggressive nature and high mortality of this disease, immediate surgical intervention, coupled with antibiotic therapy and physiologic support, is necessary to prevent complications and death.

AB  - Summary Thirty-six Thoroughbred racehorses that died at California racetracks between October 1993 and July 1994 were evaluated for stress fractures in the caudal portion of the thoracic and lumbosacral regions of the spine and the pelvis. The lumbosacral spine and pelvis were collected, debrided of soft tissues and examined visually for the presence of an incomplete fracture line and focal periosteal proliferation, characteristic of a stress fracture. Sixty-one per cent of specimens had evidence of stress fracture in the caudal portion of the thoracic and lumbosacral regions of the spine and the pelvis. Vertebral lamina stress fractures were found in 50% of specimens and were positively associated with the severity of dorsal spinous process impingement and overall severity of articular process degenerative changes. Pelvic stress fractures affected 28% of specimens and occurred more frequently in older horses. Pelvic stress fractures were positively associated with the severity of lumbar transverse process impingement and several ilial articular surface degenerative changes. A high prevalence of vertebral and pelvic stress fractures was noted in this sample of Thoroughbred racehorses that died because of unrelated injuries. Vertebral and pelvic stress fractures need to be considered in the clinical evaluation of horses with back problems or hindlimb lameness. Undiagnosed stress fractures of the vertebrae or pelvis could be a significant cause of poor performance and lameness in Thoroughbred racehorses.
