AB  - Hospital acquired infections (HAI) are a major source of morbidity and mortality in human and veterinary hospitals. Research in human hospitals has shown that well focused staff education is an important step in limiting the development of HAI. Our hospital currently has no training program with respect to HAI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the general knowledge of hospital staff concerning HAI as the first step in developing a hospital wide education program. Ninety doctors and technicians were given a questionnaire containing 15 questions about HAI. The questionnaires were hand distributed and immediately completed. Ten of the questions tested knowledge of HAI, while five questions concerned the individual's perception of HAI in our hospital. Answers were given as a range from strongly agree to strongly disagree or in the form of multiple choice. With respect to their perception of HAI, 66% of technicians and 50% of doctors believed that they possess a good working knowledge of HAI. Several areas for improvement in hospital staff knowledge were identified. Technicians were more likely than doctors to incorrectly believe that 1) routine environmental cultures are effective at preventing HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 30%, doctors 52%), 2) that all animals that aspirated gastric contents under anesthesia develop clinical evidence of pneumonia (percent correct answer: technicians 55%, doctors 84%), and 3) that animals with an indwelling urinary catheter should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics (percent correct answer: technicians 51%, doctors 90%). In addition, doctors were more likely to identify Amikacin as the antibiotic of choice for patients with HAI in our hospital (percent correct answer: technicians 27%, doctors 79%). Neither group was able to adequately identify the patients in the ICU as the primary reservoir for the multi-drug resistant pathogens that cause HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 20%, doctors 15%). The discrepancy in knowledge between the two groups is likely explained by attendance of faculty, residents, and interns at one or more continuing education rounds sessions where HAI were discussed. This finding is contrary to what is frequently found in human hospitals where the nursing staff typically demonstrates superior knowledge of HAI when compared to doctors. The results of this study demonstrate that knowledge of HAI is not optimal in both the doctors and technicians in our hospital. Further better focused efforts are warranted to address the educational shortcomings evidenced by this study.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Previous reports of clostridial myonecrosis have either focused on individual case reports or have been small retrospective studies reporting very high mortality rates. Objectives: The objective of this study was to describe the outcome of cases of clostridial myonecrosis submitted to 2 referral equine hospitals in the United States over a 15 year period. Methods: A retrospective study of case material selected on the basis of positive Clostridium spp. culture or the identification of Clostridium spp. by specific fluorescent antibody testing from soft tissue wounds was performed at Cornell and Wisconsin. Results: 37 cases of clostridial myonecrosis were documented. Twenty-seven horses survived, 8 were subjected to euthanasia and 2 died during treatment for an overall survival rate of 73%. Twenty-five cases (68%) were associated with Clostridium perfringens alone, 6 cases (16%) with Cl. septicum alone, 4 cases with mixed clostridial infections (11%), 1 case with Cl. sporogenes and 1 with an unspeciated Clostridium spp. The highest survival rate of 81% was docum ented for those cases from which Cl. perfringens alone was isolated. The most common antecedent condition prior to referral was colic. The myonecrotic lesion occurred within 6?72 h of a soft tissue injection in 34 cases but was associated with a wound or laceration in the remaining 3 cases. Of the 34 cases associated with recent injections, 24 were associated with i.m. injections in the cervical region, 4 in the semimembranosus/semitendinosus region, 3 in the gluteal region, 2 with perivascular leakage of drugs administered into the jugular vein and 1 case developed simultaneously in the gluteal and neck region following injections at both sites. Conclusions: Clostridial myonecrosis can occur following the i.m. or inadvertent perivascular administration of a wide variety of commonly administered drugs. It is most common in the neck musculature. Aggressive treatment can be associated with survival rates of up to 81% for cases due to Cl. perfringens alone. Survival rates for other Clostridial spp. tend to be lower. Potential relevance: A combination of high dose i.v. antibiotic therapy and surgical fenestration/debridement is the best approach to cases of clostridial myonecrosis. With rapid diagnosis and therapeutic intervention, horses may have up to an 81% chance of survival.

AB  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a description of a physiological finding rather than a diagnosis. Pulmonary arterial pressure is the result of interactions among pulmonary blood flow (right ventricular cardiac output), pulmonary vascular impedance and post-capillary pressure (typically reflecting left atrial pressure). When elevations in pulmonary arterial pressure (systolic/diastolic pulmonary arterial pressure > ?30/19 mmHg at rest) are accompanied by increased left atrial pressure, pulmonary arterial hypertension may be considered secondary to left-heart failure. Introduction of Doppler methods to diagnose pulmonary arterial hypertension has increased the awareness of the prevalence and importance of pulmonary arterial hypertension dogs with left-heart failure. Increasing understanding of the mechanism of development of pulmonary venous hypertension and reactive pulmonary arterial hypertension in dogs with left-heart disease has led to the development of successful additive therapies for progressive clinical signs in the setting of chronic therapy for congestive heart failure due to left-sided valvular and myocardial dysfunction. Because effective therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension secondary to chronic left-sided cardiac dysfunction are now available, screening for pulmonary arterial hypertension should be a regular part of the Doppler echocardiographic examination in a clinical setting of chronic therapy for left-sided congestive heart failure due to valvular or myocardial disease.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate a distractable titanium cage for the treatment of disk-associated wobbler syndrome (DAWS). Study Design: Prospective study. Animals: Dogs (n=7) with DAWS. Methods: After total discectomy of C5?C6 and C6?C7, the median part of the vertebral body of C6 was removed with preservation of the lateral walls and dorsal cortex. The removed cancellous bone was collected. The implant was placed in the bony defect of C6. After placement, the titanium cage was distracted and affixed by 4 screws. Finally, the implant was filled and covered with cancellous bone. Dogs had follow-up examinations at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Six months after surgery, cervical radiographs and computed tomography (CT) were performed. Results: Although no intraoperative complications occurred, correct placement of the cage was technically challenging. Revision surgery was necessary in 2 dogs because of implant loosening and aggravation of vertebral tilting. All dogs improved after discharge from the hospital. In 1 dog, recurrence of clinical signs caused by articular facet proliferation at an adjacent intervertebral disk space occurred. Radiographs at 6 months demonstrated cage subsidence in 4 dogs. In all dogs, CT was suggestive for fusion of the bone graft with the vertebral body. Conclusions: Although results are promising, technical adaptations will be necessary to make this specific surgical technique, designed for humans, suitable for routine use in dogs.

AB  - A 51-year-old female presented with agminate flesh-colored, slightly hyperkeratotic papules, 3?5?mm in diameter, on her upper back and to a lesser extent on the upper chest, neck and forehead. The papules were centered around the hair follicles and several showed mild perifollicular erythema. Clinical impression was keratosis pilaris with an unusual distribution or follicular mucinosis. Medications included hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), begun several months previously, along with potassium supplements. Histologic findings revealed mild interface dermatitis with rare individually necrotic keratinocytes and mild pigment incontinence, a superficial and mid perivascular and periappendageal lymphocytic infiltrate with marked dermal mucin deposition and extravasated erythrocytes. No definitive basement membrane thickening was present. Laboratory investigation revealed antinuclear antibodies at 1:640; anti-double stranded DNA and anti-histone antibody titers were normal. Following discontinuance of HCTZ and addition of topical steroids, her eruption slowly resolved. Taken together, these findings are those of a new cutaneous manifestation of a drug-induced lupus-like eruption. We have named it drug-induced follicular lupus-like eruption to reflect the drug-induced counterpart of the newly described follicular lupus erythematosus.

AB  - A 47-year-old sculptor presented with an ulcer on her neck. She is non-diabetic and had been on potassium iodide for hyperthyroidism. She developed a pruritic rash (?drug eruption), and her neck had been scratched repeatedly with papier-mache (PM)-covered fingers while she worked on PM sculptures for 3 consecutive months. Debrided material from neck ulcer revealed innumerable pieces of refractile PM in various shapes in the background of necrotic tissue and fibrinoid exudate, on polaroscopic examination of H&E sections. Stains for micro-organisms (for fungi, acid-fast bacilli, and actinomycosis) were negative. In an attempt to remove residual embedded PM, wide excision of the site and full-thickness skin graft was done. After initial successful take and healing, the area redeveloped an ulcer. Additional debridement and biopsy from the graft site showed PM clustered around the blood vessels in the reticular dermis. PM is a product of paper pulp commonly used in arts and crafts. Rare cases of lead exposure in PM workers have been reported in the literature, however, no cutaneous problems caused by PM have been reported to date.

AB  - ABSTRACT 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP or fampridine) is a potassium channel-blocking agent that has been shown to restore conduction in focally demyelinated axons. A sustained-release matrix tablet form of 4-AP (fampridine-SR) is currently undergoing multicenter clinical trials in patients with multiple sclerosis or chronic spinal cord injury. This review describes the pharmacology and mechanisms of action of 4-AP, its pharmacokinetics in human subjects, and the outcomes of clinical trials employing either immediate-release or sustained-release formulations of the drug. The randomized clinical trials that have been completed to date indicate that K+ channel blockade may prove to be a useful strategy for ameliorating central conduction deficits due to demyelination. Diverse neurological gains have been reported for both motor and sensory domains. At the present time, however, the clinical trials have not provided sufficiently robust or definitive evidence of efficacy to gain regulatory approval for the symptomatic management of patients with either multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury.

AB  - Jeanine Yip Menck, Susan Mais Requejo, Kornelia Kulig: Thoracic spine dysfunction in upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type 1. (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA) J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2000;30:401?409. The objective of this case study was to demonstrate the importance of assessment and treatment of the thoracic spine in the management of a patient with signs and symptoms of upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I. The patient was a 38-year-old woman who suffered a traumatic injury to her left hand. Five months after the injury, she presented with severe pain, immobility of the left arm, and associated dystrophic changes. She was unable to work and needed help in some activities of daily living. The patient was treated for 3 months in 36 visits. Initial treatment consisted of cutaneous desensitization, edema management, and gentle therapeutic exercises. However, further examination indicated hypomobility and hypersensitivity of the upper thoracic spine. Joint manipulation of the T3 and T4 segments was implemented. The patient's status was monitored. Immediately after the vertebral manipulation, there was significant increase in the left hand's skin temperature and a decrease in hyperhydrosis as measured by palpation. Shoulder range of motion increased from 135º to 175° and the patient reported reduced pain. The decrease in the patient's dystrophic and allodynic symptoms permitted further progress in functional reeducation. The patient was discharged with full return to independence and initiation of a vocational training program. Conclude that the assessment and treatment of the thoracic spine should be considered in patients with upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I. Comment by Karen Crawford, RPT. This is a study demonstrating the importance of assessment of the thoracic spine to manage patients with signs and symptoms of upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I). The patient was a 38-year-old female with traumatic injury to the left hand. The purpose of this study is to determine the relation between distal symptoms of CRPS-I and the thoracic spine and to describe the use of thoracic spine manipulation in the management of patients with CRPS-I in the upper extremity. CRPS-I in the upper extremity often exhibits postural deviations associated with protective positioning of the arm. It emanates as trunk motion during upper activities and may present with decreased thoracic intervertebral mobility. This study believes that the evaluation and treatment in areas proximal to a patient's symptoms in CRPS-I may be necessary. Hypomobility secondary to abnormal posturing and anatomical proximity of the sympathetic ganglions to the thoracic spine may contribute to the link between upper quadrant CRPS-I and thoracic joint dysfunction. In the study, a 38-year-old, left-hand dominant, female who sustained trauma to her left wrist and hand while at work was seen in physical therapy for a total of 36 visits. Initial treatment consisted of desensitization, edema management, and general therapeutic exercises. Further examination indicated hypomobility and hypersensitivity of the upper thoracic spine. At that time, joint manipulation of T3 and T4 segments was implemented. The patient's status was monitored and range of motion, strength, temperature, and skin moisture were measured. The patient reported minimal changes in her status, and 1 month into treatments, she hit her left hand on a door and consequently discontinued therapy because of increased pain. Five months after the initial injury, patient was reevaluated. She then received physical therapy 3 times per week for 12 weeks and was discharged with significant improved functional status. At the initial examination, the diagnosis of CRPS-I was based on the IASP Committee on Taxonomy. The initial treatment objective was pain management and edema control. The long-term goal was return to a functional status. Initial treatment consisted of gentle active and passive wrist and finger range of motion and tubagrip for edema management. A home program desensitization was implemented. The patient's active participation in therapy was limited secondary to her willingness to move her left arm. Treatment 2 included evaluation and manipulation of the upper thoracic spine. Her clinician used her manipulating hand as a fulcrum by placing it under the supine patient at the level of thoracic joint dysfunction. A thrust was delivered through the patient's folded arms as she exhaled and there as an audible click. There was an immediate normalization of skin temperature, color, as well as significantly decreased allodynic response to light touch along the left arm and the left upper thoracic vertebral column. Segmental thoracic mobility was immediately improved and there was immediate increase in shoulder flexion after this treatment. This reduction of signs and symptoms of CRPS-I made it possible to proceed with functional rehabilitation. Manipulation of the thoracic spine may have resulted in improvements in distal upper extremity pain, skin color, and temperature in a patient with CRPS-I. One explanation is that disuse of the arm and abnormal posturing may contribute to thoracic hypomobility. The anatomic proximity of the sympathetic chain to the dysfunctional thoracic joints may predispose the ganglions to mechanical pressure. Therefore, it is concluded that the evaluation and treatment of areas proximal to the patient's symptoms are necessary. It is difficult to identify the mechanism responsible for changing distal symptoms after thoracic manipulation. The immediate increase in shoulder flexion after manipulation is likely due to mechanical change in the tissue. In conclusion, this study describes a link between the thoracic spine and distal symptoms in patients with CRPS-I. Thoracic joint manipulation appeared to improve spinal mobility, and also appeared to relieve distal and autonomic symptoms. These improvements allowed for functional rehabilitation of the effected arm. Therefore, it is the opinion of the study that the mobility of the thoracic spine should be evaluated for patients with autonomic dysfunction diagnosed with CRPS-I. The research also indicates a need for further research to define the relationship between neurogenic symptoms and musculoskeletal pathology.

They are found in up to 80% of patients with epilepsy but are only weakly related to seizure frequency or seizure severity. Indeed their clinical relevance in highly controversial and a principle of treatment is to avoid over-interpretation of epileptiform activity. Experimental data shows that interictal spikes and ictal discharges are generated by different populations of neuron through different cellular and network mechanisms and may represent a condition that delays or prevents seizure onset. However, in the immature brain seizure discharges may cause neuronal cell loss. In older children and adults interictal discharges can be accompanied by brief interruption of cognitive function even in the absence of overt seizures (transitory cognitive impairment). In children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome and CSWS (continuous spike-waves during slow sleep) prolonged nocturnal discharges can have devastating effects on language and / or behavior. This multi-disciplinary workshop will discuss the pathophysiology of interictal discharges and the significance of epileptiform activity in neonates and in older children.

AB  - Reflex sympathetic dystrophy. (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY) Int J Dermatol 2000;39:481?486. This review aimed to familiarize the dermatologist with the essential features of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. It highlights areas that are most likely to be of interest to the dermatologist. Information regarding diagnosis, pathogenesis theories, and treatment are included. Comment by Enrique Reig, MD. This paper analyses RSD from the point of view of a specialist in dermatology. It addresses in depth the definition of RSD (or the new name, CRPS type I), the symptoms required for adequate diagnosis, some theories to explain this syndrome, and some of the treatments available. It highlights the clinical pictures, which can cause RSD (trauma, ischemia, tumors, infection, neurological and iatrogenic causes), and particularly dermatological syndromes (minor surgery, postherpetic neuralgia, Dupuytren, vasculitis ?). The treatment has a bipolar objective: to relieve pain in order to be able to apply appropriate physical therapy, which will allow recovery of the involved limb. There are more than 60 treatments reported in the literature, suggesting that there is no universal protocol. However, prevention of RSD, and particularly the early onset of treatment are essential for achieving functional and pain relief. To suppress sympathetic hyperactivity, nerve blocks (somatic and sympathetic), intravenous regional blockade with guanethidine or reserpine, alpha blockers (phentolamine), beta blockers (propranolol), and calcitonine can be used. No reference is made to anticonvulsants (gabapentine, topiramate), antidepressants (ie, amitriptyline), intravenous lidocaine, or spinal cord stimulation.

The T11-L4 dural membranes from 5 fresh (immediately after extraction of organs for transplantation) male patients declared brain dead, ages 23, 46, 48, 55, and 60, were excised by anterior laminectomy. Morphologic orientation of the membrane and normal pH were maintained; 100 punctures at 90-degree angles were done with a new needle each time, 50 with 25-gauge Whitacre and 50 with 25-gauge Quincke needles. Half of the punctures with the Quincke needles were done with the bevel in the parallel direction to the axis of the spinal cord, and the rest with the bevel perpendicular to it. Fixation in solutions of 2.5% glutaraldehyde phosphate buffer, followed by dehydration with acetone, was done 15 min after the punctures. The acetone was removed and the specimens were metallized with carbon followed by gold and inspected under a scanning electron microscope. When the area of the dural lesions found in the external and internal surfaces produced by the 2 types of needles was compared, no significant differences were found. The percentage of lesion closing area with the Quincke needles was 88.3% and 82.7% in the external and internal surfaces, respectively. With the Whitacre needles, the percentage of closing was 86.8% and 84.8% in the epidural and arachnoid surfaces, respectively. There were differences noted in the morphology of the lesions. The Whitacre needles produced coarse lesions with significant destruction in the dura's fibers while the Quincke needles produced a ?U?-shaped lesion (flap) that mimics the opened lid of a tin can, regardless of the tip's direction. Conclude that the needles produced lesions in the dura with different morphology and characteristics. Lesions with the Quincke needles resulted in a clean-cut opening in the dural membrane while the Whitacre needle produced a more traumatic opening with tearing and severe disruption of the collagen fibers. The lower incidence of PDPH seen in the Whitacre needles may be explained, in part, by the inflammatory reaction produced by the tearing of the collagen fibers after dural penetration. The inflammatory reaction may result in a significant edema, which may act as a plug limiting the leakage of the cerebrospinal fluid. Comment by Andrew D. Rosenberg, MD. This is an interesting article that explains why a patient will develop a postdural puncture headache (PDPH) after receiving a spinal with a Quincke needle and not after a Whitacre-type needle. The explanation is based more upon an inflammatory reaction than the direction of the needle cut. The Quincke needle appears to make a sharp cut while the Whitacre needle induced an inflammatory response including edema, which could block off the dura from leaking. It is very interesting that the response seen after the Whitacre needle was utilized occurred as quickly as it did. The article introduces the question as to whether a Quincke needle or a Whitacre needle is associated with more trauma to the dura, and which is better for decreasing the incidence of PDPD.

AB  - SUMMARY Over a 5-year period (1988?92), von Willebrand factor antigen (vWf:Ag) concentrations were determined on plasma samples from 614 Dobermanns. The vWf:Ag concentration was < 50 canine units (CU)/dL in 373 dogs (61%); these dogs were classified as carriers of the von Willebrand's disease (vWD) gene. In order to identify which dogs were at risk of haemorrhage due to vWD, we determined a cut-off vWf:Ag concentration below which dogs could be considered at risk. This cut-off was chosen in order to minimise the number of dogs genuinely at risk of haemorrhage, being wrongly classified as not at risk. This was done without sacrificing the specificity of the cut-off to any great extent. A vWf:Ag concentration of < 36 CU/dL was empirically chosen as the optimum cut-off concentration. In 282 dogs (76% of the carriers), the vWf:Ag concentration was below this cut-off and these dogs were, thus, classified as being at risk of haemorrhage due to vWD. Haemorrhage attributable to vWD was seen in 107 dogs (29% of the carriers, or 17% of all the dogs). Haemorrhage mostly followed trauma or surgery, but spontaneous genitourinary and gastrointestinal haemorrhages were also frequent. Of these dogs, 92 were of known age, with a median of 3 years, and 102 were of known sex, with 61% being female. In 89 dogs in which the severity of haemorrhage was subjectively assessed, mild and moderate bleeding occurred with similar frequency (48% and 43%, respectively). There were 8 cases of severe haemorrhage, with two deaths. The likelihood of haemorrhage was related to the vWf:Ag concentration: only 8% of 91 dogs with concentrations between 36 and 49 CU/dL had haemorrhage attributable to vWD, but 36% with concentrations < 36 CU/dL did so. Furthermore, dogs with haemorrhage attributable to vWD had significantly (P < 0.001) lower vWf:Ag concentrations (median 12 CU/dL, n = 107) than dogs with no such history (median 30 CU/dL, n = 132). The data indicate that vWD is a significant problem in the Dobermann breed in Australia and we accordingly recommend that steps be taken to reduce its prevalence, such as the establishment of a national testing scheme to determine the vWD status of all dogs used for breeding.
