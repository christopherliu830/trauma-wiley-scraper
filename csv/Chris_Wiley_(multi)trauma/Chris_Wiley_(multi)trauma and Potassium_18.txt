AB  - A survey of the nutritional state of surgical patients using haematological and biochemical measurements has demonstrated a higher frequency of abnormal values In patients following major surgery. Anthropometric measurements in patients did not differ from non-hospitalised controls. The routine use of multi-channel biochemical analysis to estimate plasma albumin, and the estimation of haemoglobin levels are of value in the postoperative management of surgical patients. Consideration of early intravenous feeding should be given to those patients who do not make a rapid recovery from major surgery.

AB  - Abstract. Tritos NA, Weinrib S, Kaye TB (Lahey Hitchcock Clinic, Burlington; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston; and Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA). Endocrine manifestations of Erdheim?Chester disease (a distinct form of histiocytosis) (Case Report). J Intern Med 1998; 244: 529?35. Erdheim?Chester disease (ECD) is a disorder of unclear aetiology, characterized by exuberant histiocyte proliferation and a variable clinical course. We report the case of a woman with multi-organ involvement secondary to ECD. Central diabetes insipidus (CDI), hyperprolactinaemia, gonadotropin insufficiency and decreased insulin-like growth factor I levels were present, suggesting hypothalamic?pituitary dysfunction. The high-intensity signal of the posterior pituitary on T1-weighted images was absent on magnetic resonance imaging, but no sellar mass lesions or stalk thickening were apparent. Additionally, our patient had bilateral adrenal enlargement. Even though ECD is a rare cause of neuroendocrine dysfunction or adrenal enlargement, it should be considered in patients with these disorders in the setting of multiorgan disease.

AB  - A cat receiving chemotherapy for lymphoma was administered a four times overdose of vinblastine in error. Severe, acute life-threatening toxicities occurred. The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) was suspected based on electrolyte disturbances. A favourable outcome was achieved with aggressive supportive care. Personnel involved in administering chemotherapy to small animal patients must check that the patient is receiving the correct drug, at the appropriate dose, prior to every treatment.

AB  - Eur J Clin Invest 2012; 42 (3): 290?302 Abstract Background and aims? Studies suggest clinical benefits of parenteral fish oil (FO), rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), over soyabean oil (SO), rich in n-6 PUFAs, in patients with pro-inflammatory conditions such as sepsis and trauma. Because the mechanisms behind these observations remain unclear, the present study explored the effects of intravenous infusion of FO and SO on fatty acid incorporation, immune functions and (anti)oxidant balance in healthy human volunteers. Methods? Saline, a SO emulsion and a FO emulsion were administered for one hour on three consecutive days at a rate of 0·2?g/kg?BW/h to eight subjects in a randomized cross-over design with a 3-week interval between treatments. Plasma phospholipid and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fatty acid compositions, and leucocyte counts and functions were assessed prior to the first infusion (T?=?0, baseline) and 1?day (T?=?4, early effects) and 8?days (T?=?11, late effects) after the third infusion. Results? Fish oil infusion significantly increased n-3 PUFA proportions and decreased n-6 PUFA proportions in plasma phospholipids and PBMCs. There were no differences in immune functions or (anti)oxidant balance between treatments at any time. Conclusions? The present lipid infusion protocol appears to be safe and well tolerated and provides significant incorporation of n-3 PUFAs into plasma phospholipids and PBMCs. In the absence of overt inflammation, no direct effects of FO were observed on immune function or (anti)oxidant balance. This model may be useful to evaluate effects of parenteral lipids in other settings, for example in individuals displaying an inflammatory state.

AB  - Summary In this chapter, we review the epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of eating disorders. In synthesizing this material, we note that the eating disorders truly underscore the relevance of a biopsychosocial perspective in the evaluation and treatment of psychiatric disorders. The epidemiology of the main eating disorders, anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN), is considered in terms of prevalence, age of onset, gender, race, socioeconomic profile, etc. Etiology appears to be multi-determined and probably results from the complex intersection of a variety of biological, psychological, and social variables, which vary from case to case. The diagnoses of AN and BM are examined in detail, assessment tools enumerated, and the medical complications summarized. The treatment of AN and BN are dealt with in turn. With AN, the importance of engagement with the patient and determination of the appropriate treatment environment are underscored, and strategies for behavior modification outlined, with the initial focus being weight restoration. The roles of psychotherapy and psychotropic medications are described. For BN, the normalization of eating patterns and the interruption of the binge/purge cycle are the initial treatment goals. Treatment options include behavioral strategies, psychotherapy, and psychotropic medication. The difficulties in assessing outcome in these patients are discussed, and the potential impact on fertility and pregnancy. Finally, binge eating disorder is briefly reviewed.

AB  - Abstract Background Rat bite fever is a zoonotic disease that has been described in laboratory personnel as well as the general population. Methods A 24-year-old male pet shop employee contracted the disease through a minor superficial finger wound on a contaminated rat cage. The disease progressed from a flu-like illness to endocarditis involving first the aortic valve and then the mitral valve and septum. Despite aggressive therapy including two surgical procedures, the patient died from sepsis and multi-organ system failure 59 days after initial injury. Results This is the first reported case of rat-bite fever (RBF) in a pet shop work setting. Conclusions Zoonotic infections may present a significant hazard to workers handling animals. Education on hazards of animal contact and other preventive measures are needed in small places of business like pet shops. Am. J. Ind. Med. 45:357?360, 2004. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary This chapter includes a collection of miscellaneous organisms that have caused disease in poultry or are a public health concern. The less common pathogens implicated in poultry loss included are Staphylococcosis, Streptococcus and Enterococcus, Erysipelas, avian intestinal spirochetosis, tuberculosis. Disease syndromes included in the chapter include beak necrosis, venereal disease of geese, and liver granulomas, but are not identified to a specific organism responsible because of the multifactorial nature of the disease. Staphylococcosis is diagnosed by culturing suspected clinical material including exudate from joints, yolk material, and stab swabs of internal organs. Staphylococcosis can resemble infection with Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella gallinarum, Mycoplasma synoviae, reoviruses, or any other infection of bones or joints that is hatchery-related, associated with mechanical trauma, or causes septicemia. Prevention and control of Enterococcus infections require reducing stress and preventing immunosuppressive diseases and conditions. Proper cleaning and disinfection can reduce environmental enterococcal resident flora to minimize external exposure.

AB  - Summary Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) occurs in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease and may represent an emergency condition because of the detrimental effects of excess thyroid hormone on underlying heart abnormalities. When AIT represents an imminent risk for cardiac function, it should be managed without delay, because the late resolution of thyrotoxicosis is associated with a high mortality rate. Under these circumstances, emergent thyroidectomy may represent the most effective and rapid way to resolve thyrotoxicosis.

AB  - Abstract Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rapidly progressive soft tissue infection with high morbidity and mortality rates. Its occurrence in the head and neck region is uncommon, the majority of reported cases being limited to involvement of the neck, usually from infections of dental or pharyngeal origin. Involvement of the face from NF is rare; only 35 such cases have been reported in the literature since 1960. It is not only associated with a high mortality but can also result in severe disfigurement of the face, posing challenging reconstructive problems. Successful management of facial NF requires early diagnosis, prompt institution of broad spectrum antibiotics, aggressive surgical debridement to control the infection, and reconstruction of the resultant soft tissue defects. This report describes four additional cases of facial necrotizing fasciitis. One of the four patients died as a result of sepsis and multi-organ system failure. Two of the three surviving patients had significant facial disfigurement. A comprehensive review of the facial NF cases reported in the literature is also provided. Based on our experience with facial NF and the results of all previous case reports, the clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, and management of this disease are discussed.

AB  - Summary A large body of evidence from observational and prospective randomized studies in hospitalized patients indicates a strong association between hyperglycemia and increased mortality, morbidity, length of stay, and complications. Hyperglycemia can occur in patients with diabetes, as well as in non-diabetic subjects with stress-induced hyperglycemia. The risk of mortality and complications correlates with the severity of hyperglycemia, with higher risk in patients without a history of diabetes. In addition, numerous studies have shown that improved glycemic control during hospitalization decreases the rate of complications in critical and non-critical care settings. This chapter reviews the risks associated with hyperglycemia in different clinical situations in non-critical care patients and outlines practical protocols for the management of hyperglycemia in patients with stress hyperglycemia and in patients with diabetes admitted to general medicine and surgery services.

AB  - OBJECTIVE?All of the presently used methods for in-vivo determination of body composition have inherent methodological errors and depend on various assumptions. We have therefore compared several different methods used to measure body fat in adult GH deficiency during GH treatment. DESIGN?Comparison of body composition data from a two-phase trial with an initial placebo-controlled, double-blind 6-month period, followed by open treatment with GH until all patients had received GH for 12 months. PATIENTS?Twenty-five patients with known GH deficiency entered the study. Baseline examinations were complete in 23 patients, and 22 patients (16 males, 6 females) completed all examinations after treatment. MEASUREMENTS?Body fat calculated from total body potassium (TBK) by whole-body 40K counting, total body water (TBW) by tritium dilution, total body nitrogen (TBN) by neutron activation, and bioelectric impedance (BIA) measurements were compared to body fat determinations by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) in two-compartment and multicompartment body composition models. RESULTS?At baseline, DEXA fat mass agreed well at group level with measurements based on TBW or TBK alone, in a four-compartment model based on TBK and TBW, and a multicompartment model based on bone mineral (by DEXA), TBN and TBW. Body fat by BIA agreed less well. After 12 months of GH treatment, body fat decreased by all methods used. This decrease was smaller by DEXA than by the other methods. The four-compartment model based on TBK and TBW, and TBW alone, showed the best agreement with changes in DEXA fat. CONCLUSION?All methods showed a decrease of body fat with GH treatment, but variation between methods was considerable.

AB  - As an Extracellular Matrix (ECM) component, Hyaluronic acid (HA) plays a multi-faceted role in cell migration, proliferation and differentiation at micro level and system level events such as tissue water homeostasis. Among its biological functions, it is known to interact with cytokines and contribute to their retention in ECM microenvironment. In addition to its biological functions, it has advantageous physical properties which result in the industrial endeavors in the synthesis and extraction of HA for variety of applications ranging from medical to cosmetic. Recently, HA and its derivatives have been the focus of active research for applications in biomedical device coatings, drug delivery systems and in the form of scaffolds or cell-laden hydrogels for tissue engineering. A specific reason for the increase in use of HA based structures is their immunomodulatory and regeneration inducing capacities. In this context, this article reviews recent literature on modulation of the implantable biomaterial microenvironment by systems based on HA and its derivatives, particularly hydrogels and microscale coatings that are able to deliver cytokines in order to reduce the adverse immune reactions and promote tissue healing.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? Flupirtine is an established clinical analgesic for mild to moderate musculoskeletal pain states. It has recently been shown to be a KCNQ 2?3 potassium channel opener. These experiments were performed to see if this property could be useful in treating more severe pain states characterised by central sensitisation with the drug either given alone or in combination with morphine. Methods:? Experiments were performed in rats in an observer blinded fashion with vehicle controls. Non sedating doses of flupirtine, morphine and combinations containing both drugs were defined using the rotarod technique. Dose response relationships were determined for non sedating doses of both drugs given alone and together in combination in causing antinociception in three nociception paradigms: electrical pain; carrageenan paw inflammation; streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathy. Results:? Flupirtine and morphine when given alone caused slight to moderate antinociception in all three paradigms. Flupirtine also caused significant increases in morphine antinociception in all three models. In carrageenan paw inflammation complete reversal of carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia was caused by 10?mg/kg flupirtine in combination with 0.4?mg/kg morphine. These doses of the two drugs were ineffective when given alone but the combination caused complete antinociception in this model of inflammatory pain. In the diabetic neuropathy model (see figure) morphine 3.2?mg/kg given alone caused significant antinociception but the size of that response was significantly less than that caused by a lower dose of morphine (1.6?mg/kg shown to be ineffective when it was given alone) given in combination with flupirtine 10?mg/kg (p?<?0.001; one way ANOVA). Conclusions:? Flupirtine should be investigated as an adjunct analgesic with opioids for the management of patients with severe pain states involving central sensitization.

AB  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE 2012; 19:843?849 ? 2012 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine Abstract Objectives:? Drug overdose is a leading cause of cardiac arrest and is currently the second leading cause of overall injury-related fatality in the United States. Despite these statistics, the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events (ACVEs) in emergency department (ED) patients following acute drug overdose is unknown. With this study, we address the 2010 American Heart Association Emergency Cardiovascular Care update calling for research to characterize the incidence of in-hospital ACVE following drug overdose. Methods:? This was a prospective cohort study at two tertiary care hospitals over 12?months. Consecutive adult ED patients with acute drug overdose were prospectively followed to hospital discharge. The main outcome was occurrence of in-hospital ACVE, defined as the occurrence of one or more of the following: myocardial injury, shock, ventricular dysrhythmia, and cardiac arrest. Results:? There were 459 ED patients with suspected drug overdose, of whom 274 acute drug overdose qualified and were included for analysis (mean [±SE] age?=?40.3?[±1.0]?years; 63% male). Hospital course was complicated by ACVE in 16 patients (some had more than one): 12 myocardial injury, three shock, two dysrhythmia, and three cardiac arrest. The incidence of ACVE was 5.8% overall (95% confidence interval [CI]?=?3.6% to 9.3%) and 10.7% (95% CI?=?6.6% to 16.9%) among inpatient admissions, with all-cause mortality at 0.7% (95% CI?=?0.2% to 2.6%). Conclusions:? Based on this study of adult patients with acute drug overdose, ACVE may occur in up to 9.3% overall and up to 16.9% of hospital admissions. Implications for the evaluation and triage of ED patients with acute drug overdose require further study with regard to optimizing interventions to prevent adverse events.

AB  - Abstract Accurate assessment of the pregnant patient in the ED depends on knowledge of physiological changes in pregnancy, and how these changes may impact on pathology tests, appearance on point-of-care ultrasound and electrocardiography. In addition the emergency physician needs to be cognisant of disorders that are unique to or more common in pregnancy. Part 1 of this review addresses potential deviations in laboratory investigation reference intervals resulting from physiological alterations in pregnancy, and the important causes of abnormal laboratory results in pregnancy. Part 2 will address the role of point-of-care ultrasound in pregnancy, physiological changes that may affect interpretation of point-of-care ultrasound, physiological changes in electrocardiography, and the safety of radiological procedures in the pregnant patient.

AB  - Study Type ? Prognosis (case series)?Level of Evidence?4 OBJECTIVE To determine the validity of a Fournier?s gangrene severity index (FGSI), developed to assign a numerical score describing the severity of FG, and evaluate factors in the survival of patients with FG. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 51 patients diagnosed with FG between 1994 and 2006. Data were collected on their medical history, which included vital signs (temperature, heart and respiratory rates) and metabolic variables (sodium, potassium, creatinine, bicarbonate levels, haematocrit, and white blood cell count). We computed a score relating to the severity of the disease at the time, and compared it to other features according to whether the patient survived or died. The different prognostic factors were assessed by univariate analysis with the Mann?Whitney U and Kendall A-B tests. RESULTS Of the evaluated 51 inpatients, eight died (16%) and 43 survived (84%). The median (range) age was 63 (17?85)?years and the median time from the onset of the symptoms until the admission to the emergency room was 7.8 (1?60)?days. The mean hospital stay was 33 (2?90) days and 17 patients were admitted to the intensive-care unit for a mean of 4.5?days. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups. Body surfaces involved were the scrotum in five patients (10%), the penis and scrotum in 11 (22%), the scrotum and perineum in 30 (59%) and the abdominal wall in five (10%). There was no statistically significant difference in the distribution in those who survived or died (P?=?0.131). The median age of 60?(17?81) years in the survivors was significantly lower than that of 73.5? (50?85)?years in those who died (P?=?0.02). There was no significant difference (P?=?0.06) between the number of repeated debridements in the survivors (3.23) and those who died (5.25). The mean (range) FGSI score for survivors was 6.7?(0?14), vs 8.7?(6?13) for those who died (P?=?0.12). The only laboratory variables associated with death were serum bicarbonate (P?=?0.04) and serum sodium (P?=?0.02) levels. CONCLUSIONS FG is an unpredictable disease process with wide variability in its presentation. In our experience, the FGSI gives no indication of the likelihood of survival, but the risk factors for predicting the severity of FG seem to be greater in older patients and those with high sodium and low bicarbonate levels.
