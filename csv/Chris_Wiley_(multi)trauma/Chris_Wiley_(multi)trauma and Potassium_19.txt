AB  - ABSTRACT Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition clinically diagnosed as a severe elevation in body temperature with central nervous system dysfunction that often includes combativeness, delirium, seizures, and coma. Classic heat stroke primarily occurs in immunocompromised individuals during annual heat waves. Exertional heat stroke is observed in young fit individuals performing strenuous physical activity in hot or temperature environments. Long-term consequences of heat stroke are thought to be due to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. This article provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in the identification of risk factors that predispose to heat stroke, the role of endotoxin and cytokines in mediation of multi-organ damage, the incidence of hypothermia and fever during heat stroke recovery, clinical biomarkers of organ damage severity, and protective cooling strategies. Risk factors include environmental factors, medications, drug use, compromised health status, and genetic conditions. The role of endotoxin and cytokines is discussed in the framework of research conducted over 30 years ago that requires reassessment to more clearly identify the role of these factors in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. We challenge the notion that hypothalamic damage is responsible for thermoregulatory disturbances during heat stroke recovery and highlight recent advances in our understanding of the regulated nature of these responses. The need for more sensitive clinical biomarkers of organ damage is examined. Conventional and emerging cooling methods are discussed with reference to protection against peripheral organ damage and selective brain cooling. Published 2015. Compr Physiol 5:611-647, 2015.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents the background, challenges, strategic mapping, high-risk markers, high-risk predictors, investigations, smart testing, management, comprehensive management and preferential management for ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The signs suggesting extensive myocardial injuries include high white blood cell count and elevated brain natriuretic peptide level (BNP). Chest pain may radiate to the left arm, neck, jaw, back or to the epigastric area. Many patients complain of chest tightness rather than chest pain. Some patients, especially the elderly, and women may present with acute shortness of breath, dizziness, pre-syncope, or syncope, nausea and vomiting, rather than classical angina. In the acute setting of STEMI, only the electrocardiogram (ECG), and basic blood tests of complete blood count and electrolytes (sodium, potassium), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine level, protime and prothrombin time are needed before the patient receives thrombolytic therapy or undergoes urgent coronary angiogram for possible angioplasty.

AB  - Abstract Advances in biomanufacturing techniques have opened the doors to recapitulate human sensory organs such as the nose and ear in vitro with adequate levels of functionality. Such advancements have enabled simultaneous targeting of two challenges in engineered sensory organs, especially the nose: i) mechanically robust reconstruction of the nasal cartilage with high precision and ii) replication of the nose functionality: odor perception. Hybrid nasal organs can be equipped with remarkable capabilities such as augmented olfactory perception. Herein, a proof-of-concept for an odor-perceptive nose-like hybrid, which is composed of a mechanically robust cartilage-like construct and a biocompatible biosensing platform, is proposed. Specifically, 3D cartilage-like tissue constructs are created by multi-material 3D bioprinting using mechanically tunable chondrocyte-laden bioinks. In addition, by optimizing the composition of stiff and soft bioinks in macro-scale printed constructs, the competence of this system in providing improved viability and recapitulation of chondrocyte cell behavior in mechanically robust 3D constructs is demonstrated. Furthermore, the engineered cartilage-like tissue construct is integrated with an electrochemical biosensing system to bring functional olfactory sensations toward multiple specific airway disease biomarkers, explosives, and toxins under biocompatible conditions. Proposed hybrid constructs can lay the groundwork for functional bionic interfaces and humanoid cyborgs.

AB  - Abstract Although the medical profession is slowly realizing that many disorders in the aged must be treated differently than in the young, there is still no proper appreciation of these age differences. Too often, when a patient reaches life-expectancy age, the physician relaxes his medical attention. It is assumed that the patient will die soon, although the actuarial statistics may show that he has many more years of life. Accordingly, therapy should be more intensive in order to attain the maximal life span. Elderly people will tolerate many major operations (e.g., herniorrhaphy or thyroidectomy) as well as young people. However, when it comes to serious major operations (e.g., radical neck dissection or radical excision of the rectum for carcinoma), the mortality rate for the aged may be four to eight times higher than for young patients. Elderly patients tolerate emergency major operations and complications very poorly. The chronologic age is not the chief factor in the mortality rate; more important are the operative complications. Therefore, preoperatively, every effort should be made to identify and treat diseases that might cause complications postoperatively. After operation a close watch must be kept for complications so that they may be treated promptly and effectively. Operative technic must be meticulous, with no excessive trauma and with particular attention to hemostasis and wound closure. The operation should be completed in the shortest possible time consistent with safety. A summary of 6 reports in the medical literature shows an operative mortality rate for major operations of 2.6 per cent in patients under 60, compared to 7.2 per cent for patients over 60. The mortality rate for emergency operations is much higher than for elective operations?18.5 per cent versus 6.5 per cent, respectively. A summary of 4 reports shows that cardiac complications were the greatest single cause of postoperative mortality (21.6 per cent), with pneumonia and atelectasis a close second. Despite precautions such as bandaging the extremities and early ambulation, pulmonary embolism accounted for 9.4 per cent of the deaths. [Though inoperable carcinoma caused more deaths (22.2 per cent of the entire group) than any of the other diseases, it is classified as a multiple cause.] Since the mortality rate for major operations in both aged and young patients is still significant, there is great need for more accuracy in determining operability.

AB  - A seven-year-old, neutered male greyhound was presented with a history of episodic shifting hindlimb lameness and pain. Ischaemic necrosis of areas of the hindlimb digits and skin and a firm swelling within the medial right thigh musculature were found on physical examination. Investigation demonstrated thrombosis of the terminal aorta and right external iliac artery with ischaemic necrosis of muscular and dermal tissue distal to the sites of thrombosis. The dog was euthanased due to poor prognosis. Necropsy findings were of a poorly differentiated invasive sarcoma of the skeletal muscle of the proximal right hindlimb, thrombosis of the aorta and right external iliac artery and secondary renal glomerulopathy. Immunohistochemistry of the neoplastic tissue indicated angiosarcoma based on expression of CD31 and factor VIII-related antigen. Thrombosis was considered likely to be due to systemic hypercoagulability because of the presence of altered flow characteristics and endothelial damage in the vascular tumour bed. Aortoiliac thrombosis, paraparesis and hindlimb ischaemia are unusual sequelae of angiosarcoma in the dog.

AB  - Summary The peritoneum covers all walls of the abdominal cavity and all viscera within the abdominal cavity. Peritonitis, or inflammation of the peritoneum, may be classified as primary or secondary, localized or generalized, and aseptic or septic. Secondary generalized septic (bacterial) peritonitis is the most common form of peritonitis in small animals. Abdominal radiography and ultrasonography are useful diagnostic tools in cases of suspected peritonitis. Dogs and cats with septic peritonitis present with historical and physical examination findings similar to patients with acute abdominal disease of other causes. Many of the same challenges in the care of patients with septic peritonitis occur preoperatively and postoperatively, including hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, and altered coagulation. Surgery should be performed as soon as adequate efforts have been made to stabilize the patient's cardiovascular status and fluid balance. Principles of surgical therapy for septic peritonitis include source control, peritoneal lavage, and peritoneal drainage.

AB  - Abstract Huperzine A (HupA), a novel alkaloid isolated from the Chinese herb Huperzia serrata, is a potent, highly specific and reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Compared with tacrine, donepezil, and rivastigmine, HupA has better penetration through the blood-brain barrier, higher oral bioavailability, and longer duration of AChE inhibitory action. HupA has been found to improve cognitive deficits in a broad range of animal models. HupA possesses the ability to protect cells against hydrogen peroxide, ?-amyloid protein (or peptide), glutamate, ischemia and staurosporine-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis. These protective effects are related to its ability to attenuate oxidative stress, regulate the expression of apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bax, P53, and caspase-3, protect mitochondria, upregulate nerve growth factor and its receptors, and interfere with amyloid precursor protein metabolism. Antagonizing effects of HupA on N-me-thyl-D-aspartate receptors and potassium currents may also contribute to its neuroprotection as well. Pharmacokinetic studies in rodents, canines, and healthy human volunteers indicated that HupA was absorbed rapidly, distributed widely in the body, and eliminated at a moderate rate with the property of slow and prolonged release after oral administration. Animal and clinical safety tests showed that HupA had no unexpected toxicity, particularly the dose-limiting hepatotoxicity induced by tacrine. The phase IV clinical trials in China have demonstrated that HupA significantly improved memory deficits in elderly people with benign senescent forgetfulness, and patients with Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia, with minimal peripheral cholinergic side effects and no unexpected toxicity. HupA can also be used as a protective agent against organophosphate intoxication.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Occupations characterized by a static low load and by repetitive actions show a high prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) in the neck?shoulder region. Moreover, muscle fatigue and discomfort are reported to play a relevant initiating role in WMSD. Aims: To investigate relationships between altered sensory information, i.e. localized muscle fatigue, discomfort and pain and their associations to changes in motor control patterns. Materials & Methods:? In total 101 subjects participated. Questionnaires, subjective assessments of perceived exertion and pain intensity as well as surface electromyography (SEMG), mechanomyography (MMG), force and kinematics recordings were performed. Results:? Multi-channel SEMG and MMG revealed that the degree of heterogeneity of the trapezius muscle activation increased with fatigue. Further, the spatial organization of trapezius muscle activity changed in a dynamic manner during sustained contraction with acute experimental pain. A graduation of the motor changes in relation to the pain stage (acute, subchronic and chronic) and work experience were also found. The duration of the work task was shorter in presence of acute and chronic pain. Acute pain resulted in decreased activity of the painful muscle while in subchronic and chronic pain, a more static muscle activation was found. Posture and movement changed in the presence of neck?shoulder pain. Larger and smaller sizes of arm and trunk movement variability were respectively found in acute pain and subchronic/chronic pain. The size and structure of kinematics variability decreased also in the region of discomfort. Motor variability was higher in workers with high experience. Moreover, the pattern of activation of the upper trapezius muscle changed when receiving SEMG/MMG biofeedback during computer work. Discussion:? SEMG and MMG changes underlie functional mechanisms for the maintenance of force during fatiguing contraction and acute pain that may lead to the widespread pain seen in WMSD. A lack of harmonious muscle recruitment/derecruitment may play a role in pain transition. Motor behavior changed in shoulder pain conditions underlining that motor variability may play a role in the WMSD development as corroborated by the changes in kinematics variability seen with discomfort. This prognostic hypothesis was further, supported by the increased motor variability among workers with high experience. Conclusion:? Quantitative assessments of the functional motor adaptations can be a way to benchmark the pain status and help to indentify signs indicating WMSD development. Motor variability is an important characteristic in ergonomic situations. Future studies will investigate the potential benefit of inducing motor variability in occupational settings.

AB  - Hypoxia is a normal and essential part of embryonic development. However, this state may leave the embryo vulnerable to damage when oxygen supply is disturbed. Embryofetal response to hypoxia is dependent on duration and depth of hypoxia, as well as developmental stage. Early postimplantation rat embryos were resilient to hypoxia, with many surviving up to 1.5 hr of uterine clamping, while most mid-gestation embryos were dead after 1 hour of clamping. Survivors were small and many had a range of defects, principally terminal transverse limb reduction defects. Similar patterns of malformations occurred when embryonic hypoxia was induced by maternal hypoxia, interruption of uteroplacental flow, or perfusion and embryonic bradycardia. There is good evidence that high altitude pregnancies are associated with smaller babies and increased risk of some malformations, but these results are complicated by increased risk of pre-eclampsia. Early onset pre-eclampsia itself is associated with small for dates and increased risk of atrio-ventricular septal defects. Limb defects have clearly been associated with chorionic villus sampling, cocaine, and misoprostol use. Similar defects are also observed with increased frequency among fetuses who are homozygous for thalassemia. Drugs that block the potassium current, whether as the prime site of action or as a side effect, are highly teratogenic in experimental animals. They induce embryonic bradycardia, hypoxia, hemorrhage, and blisters, leading to transverse limb defects as well as craniofacial and cardiovascular defects. While evidence linking these drugs to birth defects in humans is not compelling, the reason may methodological rather than biological.

AB  - Summary This chapter summarizes assessment and management of the patient with sepsis. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory, cellular and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than sepsis alone. Management of sepsis requires invasive monitoring and critical care expertise. Arterial and central venous monitoring will be required if the patient is in septic shock or once in the ICU but placement should not delay initial priorities. The first priority is adequate fluid resuscitation, using a balanced crystalloid. This should be guided by a clinical assessment of the circulation and tissue perfusion. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in sepsis and is associated with a worse outcome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a complication of sepsis. This should be suspected in patients with sepsis and also in patients with septic shock who develop purpura, prolonged oozing from puncture sites or bleeding from the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts.

AB  - Summary Myriads of wound-care products are on the market, and making the right choice for a specific wound can be complex, especially because the scientific literature on wound-care products in horses is sparse. To select the best possible dressing, the veterinarian must decide which material is needed to enhance healing. The clinician must then determine if antimicrobial therapy is required. Several antibacterial compounds are available for topical use and are often more effective than systemically administered antibiotics in the management of severe contamination, critical colonization, or infection. To serve the requirements of specific wounds, several combinations of antimicrobial drugs and dressings are available. The wound milieu changes as healing progresses and so do the requirements for dressings. Continued assessment, based on a thorough clinical examination and sound knowledge of the healing process, is indicated, therefore, to maintain an optimal environment for healing.

AB  - Fampridine SR (4-aminopyridine) is a potassium channel-blocking drug currently being investigated for its therapeutic efficacy in ameliorating central conduction deficits due to demyelination in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). The present open-label pharmacokinetic trial examined the absorption characteristics of a sustained-release form of the drug in 25 SCI subjects with chronic in complete injuries. The overall group mean Cmax of 27.7 ¬± 6.2 ng/mL occurred at a tmsx of 3.4 ¬± 1.4 hours. AUC0?12 was 210.5 ¬± 49.5 ng/mL?h. For paraplegics, AUCtmax was 76.02 ¬± 33.28 and for tetraplegics was significantly less at 51.25 ¬± 20.36 (p = 0.037). A statistically significant difference in the initial rate and extent of absorption, but not in total 4-AP bioavailability over the 12-hour study period, was evident between tetraplegic patients, 0.60 ¬± 0.23, and paraplegic patients, 0.39 ¬± 0.14 (p = 0.02). There was a linear correlation (p < 0.05) between the neurological level of injury and Cmax/AUCtmax. These results confirm and extend previous observations of different rates of drug absorption among SCI patients with lesions above and below the sympathetic outflow (T6) and provide evidence of the absorption characteristics of this sustained-release form of 4-aminopyridine, which is helpful for optimal dosing.

AB  - Summary The provision of anaesthesia for patients suffering from anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa is not without its risks. The anaesthetist needs to appreciate that these eating disorders can predispose the patient to significant risk of multi-organ dysfunction related to starvation and purging. Any such organ dysfunction can have serious implications on morbidity and mortality. Therefore, careful peri-operative management is essential to avoid anaesthetic complications. Both disorders are common, with incidences in the general population of up to 30% in girls and young women. A review of the literature on the provision of anaesthesia for anorexic patients was carried out to evaluate the potential impact of these disorders on the patient's physiology and the subsequent implications for anaesthesia.

AB  - Abstract Progressive and selective degeneration of specific classes of neurons occurs in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Differential vulnerability in this disease is evident even within supopulations that synthesize and release acetylcholine as a transmitter; i.e., basal forebrain cholinergic neurons degenerate but other classes of cholinergic neurons are relatively preserved. The basis for this selective vulnerability is unknown. Studies of differential neuronal vulnerability in AD would be facilitated if cell lines expressing neurotransmitter-specific phenotypes could be cloned from the brain. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) has been shown to be a sensitive method of detection and quantitation of the DNA products of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). CE/LIF was combined with the PCR to detect phenotypic messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, converted to cDNA using reverse transcriptase (RT), in cultures of virally immortalized brainstem progenitor cells produced during establishment of a cloning strategy. RT/PCR methods were developed for detection of the mRNAs for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the neuronal, constitutive isoform of nitric oxide synthase (c-NOS), and the growth-associated protein GAP-43, three genes known to be expressed in central cholinergic neurons. A ?nondestructive? method of screening cultured cells for their expression of c-NOS was established using depolarization with medium containing 50 mM potassium ion. These approaches were first validated using cultured SN56 (cholinergic) and N1E-115 (c-NOS-positive) neuroblastoma cells, and with primary brainstem cultures. For the cloning of novel cell lines, progenitor cells were isolated from the embryonic day 13 fetal brainstem and were immortalized by transfection with a retroviral vector that confers a temperature-sensitive SV-40 transforming activity and neomycin resistance. Cell colonies surviving in G418-containing media were isolated and cloned by dilution. Clonal cultures were expanded by growth at 33¬∞C, differentiated by switching to a low-serum medium and growth at 39¬∞C, and screened for depolarization-induced accumulation of nitrite in the medium. The subset of putative c-NOS-positive clones (about 4%) were then screened for their expression of mRNAs using RT/PCR in combination with CE/LIF. This screening protocol proved to be powerful in the rapid isolation and phenotypic characterization of immortalized progenitor cells cloned from embryonic rat brainstem.

AB  - Objective? To identify preoperative diagnostic results that predict postoperative complications and survival in feline renal-transplant recipients. Study Design? Retrospective clinical study. Animals? Sixty-one feline renal allograft recipients. Methods? Medical records for 61 consecutive cats that underwent renal allograft transplantation between January 1, 1996, and December 1, 1999, were reviewed. Age, diagnosis, body weight, body condition score, preoperative medical treatment, systolic blood pressure, packed cell volume, biochemical parameters at admission and at the time of surgery, postoperative complications, and postoperative survival were recorded. Associations of preoperative data with the occurrence of postoperative complications were determined using logistic regression. Postoperative survival was graphed using a Kaplan-Meier cumulative-survival plot. Associations of covariates with postoperative survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards analysis. Results? Two parameters were significantly associated with occurrence of postoperative central nervous system (CNS) disorders: blood urea nitrogen concentration (odds ratio = 1.083; 95% CI = 1.018 to 1.148) and serum creatinine concentration (odds ratio = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.413 to 2.187) at the time of surgery. Postoperative survival 6 months after transplantation was 59%, though 3-year survival remained at 42%. Of all covariates investigated, only recipient age (relative hazard = 1.183; 95% CI = 1.039 to 1.334) was significantly associated with survival. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance? Standard measures of preoperative renal dysfunction do not predict postoperative survival in cats after renal transplantation, although an increase in the degree of preoperative azotemia is associated with an increased risk of CNS disorders after surgery. Increased recipient age is associated with decreased survival after renal transplantation.

AB  - Summary Acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding usually presents with haematemesis or melaena, but should be considered in any patient with unexplained hypotension or syncope, or decompensated chronic liver disease. In patients with severe upper GI bleeding, a good outcome requires vigorous resuscitation, and close collaboration with medical, endoscopic, radiological and surgical teams: it is important to involve these specialists as early as possible to discuss the management plan. Urgent endoscopy is needed for patients with shock on admission, with known varices or signs of chronic liver disease, or evidence of continued bleeding. Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy should be stopped/reversed, if the benefits of doing so outweigh the risks: for patients with a mechanical prosthetic heart valve, recent acute coronary syndrome or coronary stents, discuss this with a cardiologist. Patients with low-risk peptic ulcer bleeding based on clinical and endoscopic criteria (e.g. clean ulcer base) can be discharged on the same day as endoscopy.

Nevertheless, there are several important areas of controversy with regard to the surgical approach, differences of which may impact the rate of success and the incidence of adverse effects. Cognitive sequelae of temporal lobe surgery may result from (1) resection or transgression of the lateral (neocortical) temporal lobe or the temporal stem, which may lead to impairment in learning, and/or (2) resection of mesial structures, which may lead to decline in material-specific memory. The recent multi-center clinical trial analyzing the predictors of post-surgical quality-of-life will be discussed, including the finding that improvement depends on seizure-freedom irrespective of the occurrence of verbal memory decline. Nevertheless, it is incumbent on surgeons to minimize the occurrence of these cognitive sequelae while maximizing the possibility of seizure-freedom. Several approaches to gain access to the mesial structures will be compared with regard to cognitive outcome, including anterior temporal lobectomy (standard vs. tailored), trans-cortical selective AH and trans-sylvian selective AH, which differ in terms of their disruption of the temporal neocortex and temporal stem. Alternative approaches to the mesial resection will be compared with regard to seizure-free rates and the incidence of post-surgical decline in memory, including tailoring the hippocampal resection to the presence of inter-ictal epileptic spikes vs. performing a standardized resection, and the influence of the amount of hippocampal tissue resected. Open discussion of recent results addressing these important issues will hopefully either propel the field towards consensus, or highlight the need for further randomized clinical trials to improve patient outcome following amygdalo-hippocampectomy for MTLE.
