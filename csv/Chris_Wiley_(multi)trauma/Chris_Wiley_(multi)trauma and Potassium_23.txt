AB  - Summary A prospective survey of 528 colic horses, referred to the Large Animal Hospital at the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University of Copenhagen, Denmark, during the period August 1994 to December 1998, was undertaken to develop a predictive model for application in the clinical assessment of prognosis. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, 357 colic cases were used in the elaboration of a simple clinical-practical model consisting of degree of pain, packed cell volume, capillary refill time and rectal temperature. The relationship between rectal temperature and outcome (survival/death) has been regarded as linear. It has also been reported to be nonsignificant. The present study suggests a strong U-shaped relation, which is easily transformed into a linear association and readily interpretable in the clinical situation if treated as a deviation from 38°C. Several other clinical and laboratory variables were strongly related to outcome in the bivariate analysis. The changes in sensitivity and specificity of the multivariate model, when applied as a prognostic test, were presented with changing cut-off values. The cut-off value is the level, of predicted probability of death, at which the clinical decision to treat or subject to euthanasia is taken. The predictive performance of the model was further illustrated using a mortality of 19%. The optimal accurate classification for both survival and death was 87%, which was attained when a cut-off value of 86% was selected. To minimise the number of horses unnecessarily subjected to euthanasia, the cut-off value was increased. However, this simultaneously increased the number of misclassified survivors, i.e. the number of horses that would die despite treatment. Outcome was especially poorly predicted in 4 horses, as was indicated by extreme deviance residuals. In 2 of these horses the large residuals were attributable to sudden and severe changes in the course of disease. All 4 horses had changes in variable values towards abnormality prior to death. Repeated measurements are therefore suggested in order to increase the test performance in general. The prerequisites of clinical application of prognostic models are critically discussed. The main findings of the present study indicate that degree of pain, packed cell volume, capillary refill time and temperature deviation from 38°C, used in a logistic regression model, offer a strong model for clinical assessment of prognosis.

AB  - The essential trace element copper (Cu) is required for a range of physiologic processes, including wound healing and functioning of the immune system. The correct amount of Cu must be provided in parenteral nutrition (PN) if deficiency and toxicity are to be avoided. While provision in line with the standard recommendations should suffice for most patients, Cu requirements may be higher in patients with increased gastrointestinal losses and severe burns and lower in those with cholestasis. The tests of Cu status that are currently available for clinical use are unreliable. Serum Cu concentration is the most commonly ordered test but is insensitive to Cu deficiency and toxicity and is misleadingly increased during the acute phase response. These limitations make it difficult for prescribers to assess Cu status and to decide how much Cu to provide. There is a need for better tests of Cu status to be developed to decrease uncertainty and improve individualization of Cu dosing. More information is needed on Cu requirements in disease and Cu contamination of PN components and other intravenous fluids. New multi?trace element products should be developed that provide Cu doses in line with the 2012 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition recommendations. This article discusses the evaluation and treatment of Cu deficiency and toxicity in patients treated with PN.

AB  - Because of its numerous etiologies, foot dermatitis can be difficult to diagnose despite of thorough history and physical examination. The differential diagnoses are challenging and include allergic contact dermatitis, dyshidrosis, juvenile plantar dermatosis, atopic dermatitis, lichen planus. Methods:? In the Cutaneous Allergology Unit of the Department of Dermatovenereology of Pedro Hispano Hospital, between 1999 and 2003, 804 patients were observed with suspicion of contact dermatitis. In 9,3% there was a history of recurrent foot dermatitis. All these patients were patch tested with GPEDC standard and shoe series and shoe fragments. Results:? Twenty-five patients revealed shoe contact dermatitis with positive reactions to the series tested, with an average age of 40 years. The dermatitis involved the dorsal aspect of the foot in 20 patients and the volar aspect in 8, the lateral aspects in 4, typically sparing the instep and flexural creases of the toes. The most common allergen were para-tertiary-butylphenol formaldehyde resin ? PTBFR (12 patients-48%), mercapto mix (7 patients-28%), potassium dichromate (24%), mercaptobenzothiazole (24%). Conclusions:? The most common causes of shoe contact dermatitis were glues, followed by rubber components and chromated leather. As in other studies the most common allergen in shoe dermatitis in Portugal is PTBFR in neoprene adhesives. Rubber components (accelerators) were the second more frequent allergen in this study, probably a direct result of improved fixation of chrome and a change in footwear style and chrome sensitivity explains leather allergy. Other causes of foot contact dermatitis are iatrogenic complication, clothing (socks), cosmetics, adhesive tape and professional etiology.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of the study was to investigate the presence of serum antibodies to different Leptospira serogroups in dogs with a clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis in southern Germany and to compare seroreactivity to different serogroups with history, clinical signs, laboratory findings and survival rate. Methods: In this study, the data of 42 dogs with the diagnosis of leptospirosis were evaluated retrospectively. Dogs were presented to the Small Animal Medicine Teaching Hospital (Medizinische Kleintierklinik) of the Ludwig Maximilians University Munich, Germany, between 1990 to 2003. Results: Reactivity to the serogroup grippotyphosa (13/42) was most frequently present, followed by reactivity to the serogroup saxkoebing (10/42). There was no difference in the clinical picture and the laboratory changes between dogs whose sera were reactive to different serogroups. Clinical Significance: Most of the dogs with leptospirosis in southern Germany had sera reacting to serogroups other than icterohaemorrhagiae and canicola, which are contained in the vaccine. Thus, currently available vaccines in Europe do not protect against the most common Leptospira organisms associated with clinical disease.

AB  - Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with a worldwide distribution affecting most mammalian species. Clinical leptospirosis is common in dogs but appears to be rare in cats. Both dogs and cats, however, can shed leptospires in the urine. This is problematic as it can lead to exposure of humans. The control of leptospirosis, therefore, is important not only from an animal but also from a public health perspective. The aim of this consensus statement is to raise awareness of leptospirosis and to outline the current knowledge on the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic tools, prevention and treatment measures relevant to canine and feline leptospirosis in Europe.

AB  - Does early intervention with a light mobilization program reduce long-term sick leave for low back pain? (Central Hospital in Hedmark, Ottestad, Norway) Spine 2000;25:1973?1976. This randomized, controlled clinical trial investigated the effect of a light mobilization program on the duration of sick leave for patients with subacute low back pain. Early intervention with information, diagnostics, and light mobilization may be a cost-effective method for returning patients quickly to normal activity. In this experiment, patients were referred to a low back pain clinic and given a simple and systematic program as an outpatient treatment. Patients sick-listed 8 to 12 weeks (N = 457) for low back pain were randomized into two groups: an intervention group (n = 237) and a control group (n = 220). The intervention group was examined at a spine clinic and given information and advice to stay active. The control group was not examined at the clinic, but was treated with conventional primary health care. At 12-month follow-up assessment, 68.4% in the intervention group had returned to full-duty work, as compared with 56.4% in the control group. Conclude that early intervention with examination, information, and recommendations to stay active showed significant effects in reducing sick leave for patients with low back pain. Comment by Susan Anderson, MD. This is a randomized controlled clinical trial to compare patients that have been sick listed for more than 8 weeks in Norway. Comparison was between a control group that received conventional primary health care and an intervention group that was examined at a spine clinic, given information, and advised to stay active. The authors wanted to examine if an early intervention with information, diagnostics, and light mobilization may be a cost-effective method for returning patients quickly to normal activity. This study involved 457 patients that were sick listed 8 to 12 weeks for low back pain. The inclusion criteria for the study was based on 1) 8 to 12 weeks being ?sick-listed,? 2) age (18 to 60 years), and 3) diagnosis that included back pain, low back pain, leg and thigh pain, back pain without sciatica, and sciatica. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, recent low back trauma, cauda equina symptoms, cancer, osteoporosis, rheumatic low back disease, and ongoing low back treatment. The intervention used was modification of Indahl's light mobilization program where the patient was referred to a spine clinic, answered standard questionnaires, and was interviewed and examined by a treatment team consisting of a physician and a physiotherapist. Any somatic findings during the examination were explained to the patient and information was given about their importance. All radiographs were shown and explained. The idea was to educate the patient and dedramatize their problems. The patient was assured of a good prognosis and informed of the importance of remaining active to avoid development of muscle dysfunction. The physiotherapist individually advises the patient on how to train and stretch at home. They were also advised on how to manage the back pain and resume normal activity. The patients in the control group were not examined at the clinic, but were treated with primary health care, which included at least one visit to a general practitioner. The patients were reassessed at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. The assessment was to determine if the patient had returned to full duty work. At each of the assessments, the intervention group had a higher percentage of patients that had returned to full duty work. At the 12-month follow-up, 68.4% in the intervention group had returned to full duty work as compared with 56.4% in a controlled group. This study demonstrates that a consultation with thorough examination, information, reassurance, and encouragement shows a significant effect in reducing sick leave for patients with low back pain as compared to the conventional health care guidelines used by general practitioners that tend to recommend bed rest, caution, and reduced activities. The authors suggest that information and fear reduction when offered systematically may reduce the fear of ?doing something wrong? to the back. This may then prevent unnecessary activity and long sick leave.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To record the electroencephalographic changes during castration in ponies anaesthetized with halothane and given intravenous (IV) lidocaine by infusion. The hypothesis tested was that in ponies, IV lidocaine is antinociceptive and would therefore obtund EEG changes during castration. Animals? Ten Welsh mountain ponies referred to the Department of Clinical Veterinary Medicine, Cambridge for castration under general anaesthesia. Materials and methods? Following pre-anaesthetic medication with intramuscular acepromazine (0.02?mg?kg?1) anaesthesia was induced with IV guaiphenesin (60?mg?kg?1) and thiopental (9 mg?kg?1) and maintained with halothane at an end-tidal concentration (Fe?HAL) of 1.2%. A constant rate infusion of IV lidocaine (100??g?kg?1?minute?1) was administered throughout anaesthesia. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded continuously using subcutaneous needle electrodes. All animals were castrated using a closed technique. The raw EEG signal was analysed after completion of each investigation, and the mean values of EEG variables (median frequency, spectral edge frequency, total amplitude) recorded during a baseline period (before surgery began) and the removal of each testicle were compared using anova for repeated measures. Results? Spectral edge frequency (SEF) 95% decreased during removal of the second testicle compared with baseline recordings. No other significant EEG changes during castration were measured. Conclusions? Lidocaine obtunded the EEG changes identified during castration in a previous control study, providing indirect evidence that lidocaine administered peri-operatively was antinociceptive and contributed to anaesthesia during castration. Clinical relevance? The antinociceptive effect of lidocaine combined with its minimal cardiovascular effects indicate a potential use for systemic lidocaine in clinical anaesthetic techniques.

AB  - Baclofen, a GABA agonist, is frequently used to treat muscle spasticity due to spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. Baclofen overdose can lead to coma, respiratory depression, hyporeflexia, and flaccidity. Because baclofen is primarily excreted unchanged through the kidneys, it should be given with caution, and it may be necessary to reduce the dosage.Signs of overdose may appear suddenly or insidiously. Acute massive overdose may present as coma. Less sudden and/or less severe forms of overdose may present with signs of CNS depression, excessive salivation, dizziness, nausea and/or vomiting, somnolence, and hypotonia. Should overdose appear likely, the patient should be taken immediately to a hospital. A 46-year-old man, who was treated by intermittent hemodialysis (three times a week), was admitted to our unit for signs of CNS depression, dizziness, vomiting, somnolence, and hypotonia. He was treated at the relatively low dose of baclofen, 5?mg/day, because of muscle spasticity due to spinal cord injury. His temperature was 37?°C, and predialysis laboratory data were hemoglobin 11.4?g/dl, white blood cells 6550/mm3 with normal differential count, and platelets 330000/mm3. Serum sodium was 134?mmol/l, potassium 6.4?mmom/l, bicarbonate 18.3?mmol/l, urea 30?mmol/l, creatinine 998??mol/l, glucose 5.16?mmol/l, and calcium level 2.4?mmol/l. Serum transaminases were normal. A brain computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no abnormalities. Baclofen-associated encephalopathy was considered to be the most likely etiology for this acute neurological picture. Baclofen was then stopped. Plasma concentration of baclofen was >600?ng/ml (therapeutic range 80?400?ng/ml) after 2 hours of hemodialysis and the baclofen level rapidly fell (<200?ng/ml) at the end of the hemodialysis session. After the first 4-h haemodialysis session, there was an incomplete recovery of the neurological status. After a renewed hemodialysis session the symptoms completely receded.The patient was discharged from the hospital 72?h later in a good condition. Patients with severely impaired renal function generally develop baclofen intoxication soon after the initiation of low-dose therapy. Thus, the administration of baclofen, regardless of the dosage, in these patients is not appropriate.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study Neonatal encephalopathy is the most common neurological abnormality identified in neonatal foals, but its clinical course has been rarely characterised. Objectives To describe factors associated with nonsurvival in a population of foals diagnosed with neonatal encephalopathy. Study design Retrospective cross-sectional clinical study. Methods Cases were selected from equine neonatal (≤14 days of age) admissions between 1996 and 2007. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify clinical parameters, laboratory variables and therapeutic interventions associated with nonsurvival. Results A total of 94 foals were included in the study. Median age at admission was 12 h (range 0?96 h). The most frequently identified clinical signs included abnormal udder seeking (59%), abnormal suckle (55%), inability to stand (42%), abnormal gastrointestinal motility (37%), abnormal consciousness (34%) and seizure activity (22%). Overall, 75 (79.8%) foals survived to be discharged from the hospital and 19 foals died or were subjected to euthanasia. Variables significantly associated with nonsurvival in the multivariable model were serum total calcium concentration, serum activity of alkaline phosphatase, recumbency, number of concurrent diseases, and use of vasopressors/inotropes. The model correctly classified 92.0% of cases. Conclusions Overall survival was good and similar to previous reports. Vasopressors/inotropes were the only therapeutic intervention associated with nonsurvival, suggesting that persistent hypotension is associated with nonsurvival in the current population. Foals with concurrent disease, high total calcium and low alkaline phosphatase at admission, and that were recumbent or required treatment with vasopressors/inotropes during hospitalisation, were significantly less likely to survive.

AB  - Pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, is commonly seen in dogs and cats and presents a spectrum of disease severities from acute to chronic and mild to severe. It is usually sterile, but the causes and pathophysiology remain poorly understood. The acute end of the disease spectrum is associated with a high mortality but the potential for complete recovery of organ structure and function if the animal survives. At the other end of the spectrum, chronic pancreatitis in either species can cause refractory pain and reduce quality of life. It may also result in progressive exocrine and endocrine functional impairment. There is confusion in the veterinary literature about definitions of acute and chronic pancreatitis and there are very few studies on the pathophysiology of naturally occurring pancreatitis in dogs and cats. This article reviews histological and clinical definitions and current understanding of the pathophysiology and causes in small animals by comparison with the much more extensive literature in humans, and suggests many areas that need further study in dogs and cats.

AB  - Abstract Paroxysmal movement disorders encompass varied motor phenomena. Less recognized features and wide phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity are impediments to straightforward molecular diagnosis. We describe a family with episodic ataxia type 1, initially mis-characterized as paroxysmal dystonia to illustrate this diagnostic challenge. We summarize clinical features in affected individuals to highlight underappreciated aspects and provide comprehensive phenotypic description of the rare familial KCNA1 mutation. Delayed diagnosis in this family is emblematic of the broader challenge of diagnosing other paroxysmal motor disorders. We summarize genotypic and phenotypic overlap and provide a suggested diagnostic algorithm for approaching patients with these conditions.

AB  - Summary A 16-year-old mare was presented as an emergency to the Equine Hospital of the Veterinary School of Lyon, with a 1-month history of respiratory distress. On admission the mare was in poor body condition, with severe inspiratory and expiratory dyspnoea associated with severe hypoxaemia and marked tachycardia. Wheezes were auscultated. A pulmonary biopsy revealed fibrosis of about 40% of the parenchyma. Following an episode of atrial fibrillation, an echocardiogram was carried out which revealed signs of pulmonary hypertension, consistent with cor pulmonale. Despite the lack of aetiologic explanation for the primary pulmonary disease, the general condition of the mare improved with the administration of high-dosed corticoids and antimicrobial therapy.

AB  - Summary Preeclampsia and eclampsia have the potential to produce significant maternal and fetal complications. This chapter addresses therapy for pregnant women with chronic hypertension and focuses on pharmacologic management that may diminish risk of superimposed preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is sometimes manifested by severe systemic hypertension. Careful control of hypertension must be achieved to prevent complications, such as maternal cerebral vascular accidents and placental abruption. Pregnancy-related blindness has been associated with eclampsia, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and hypertensive encephalopathy. Thrombosis and vasospasm develop and lead to multi-organ involvement, including renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, and uteroplacental dysfunction. Unlike most forms of preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome is not primarily a disease of primigravidas. The clinical signs and symptoms of patients with HELLP syndrome are classically related to the impact of vasospasm on the maternal liver. Thus, most patients present with signs or symptoms of liver compromise.

AB  - Two littermates, a young male and female boxer, were admitted to the Utrecht University?s Department of Clinical Sciences of Companion Animals within a three month period. Both dogs suffered from anaemia caused by chronic intestinal blood loss, vomiting and weight loss. In both cases, there was no response to conservative medical management. Eventually, the dogs suffered significant gastrointestinal haemorrhage that resulted in collapse. Gastroduodenoscopy and exploratory surgery showed a duodenal diverticulum in both dogs. This is the first report that describes this congenital anomaly in two siblings.

AB  - Abstract Encephalitis is a complex neurological syndrome caused by inflammation of the brain parenchyma. The management of encephalitis is challenging because: the differential diagnosis of encephalopathy is broad; there is often rapid disease progression; it often requires intensive supportive management; and there are many aetiologic agents for which there is no definitive treatment. Patients with possible meningoencephalitis are often encountered in the emergency care environment where clinicians must consider differential diagnoses, perform appropriate investigations and initiate empiric antimicrobials. For patients who require admission to hospital and in whom encephalitis is likely, a staged approach to investigation and management is preferred with the potential involvement of multiple medical specialties. Key considerations in the investigation and management of patients with encephalitis addressed in this guideline include: Which first-line investigations should be performed?; Which aetiologies should be considered possible based on clinical features, risk factors and radiological features?; What tests should be arranged in order to diagnose the common causes of encephalitis?; When to consider empiric antimicrobials and immune modulatory therapies?; and What is the role of brain biopsy?

AB  - Summary Diarrhoea is a common problem in the neonatal and suckling foal. In certain circumstances supplemental nutrition is necessary depending on the age of foal, severity of diarrhoea and presence of other systemic manifestations. Nutritional supplementation can be provided either enterally or parenterally. Enteral nutrition is superior to parenteral nutrition because it is the most natural and physiologically sound means to provide nutritional support. Parenteral nutrition may be warranted if the foal is unable to receive or tolerate enteral nutrition. Dextrose alone or with amino acids and lipids can provide appropriate nutrition when enteral feeding is not tolerated. As soon as the foal stabilises enteral feeding can be reintroduced.
