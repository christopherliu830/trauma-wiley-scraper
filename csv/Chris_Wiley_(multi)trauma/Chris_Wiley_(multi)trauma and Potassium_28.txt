AB  - Abstract Background Gastrointestinal sensorimotor dysfunction underlies a wide range of esophageal, gastric, and intestinal motility and functional disorders that collectively constitute nearly half of all referrals to gastroenterologists. As a result, substantial effort has been dedicated toward the development of prokinetic agents intended to augment or restore normal gastrointestinal motility. However, the use of several clinically efficacious gastroprokinetic agents, such as cisapride, domperidone, erythromycin, and tegaserod, is associated with unfavorable cardiovascular safety profiles, leading to restrictions in their use. Purpose The purpose of this review is to detail the cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead commonly to drug-induced cardiac arrhythmias, specifically drug-induced long QT syndrome, torsades de pointes, and ventricular fibrillation, to examine the cardiovascular safety profiles of several classes of prokinetic agents currently in clinical use, and to explore potential strategies by which the risk of drug-induced cardiac arrhythmia associated with prokinetic agents and other QT interval prolonging medications can be mitigated successfully.

AB  - Objective To describe a case of diabetes mellitus in a koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). Design A case report with controls. Procedures We describe clinical and laboratory findings in a 6-year-old, free-living, female koala presented with traumatic injury and subsequently found to have polydipsia, hyperglycaemia and glucosuria. Over a 5 week period, serum biochemical analyses, haematological examinations, urinal-yses, measurement of serum insulin and fructosamine concentrations, necropsy, histopathological examination of a range of tissues and immunohistochemical examination of the pancreas for insulin-containing cells were done. For reference purposes, serum insulin and fructosamine concentrations were determined in four and two healthy koalas, respectively, and three healthy koalas pancreases were examined histo-logically and immunohistochemically. Results The koala had persistent hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia, hyponatraemia, hypochloraemia and glucosuria. Serum insulin concentration of the diabetic koala was only marginally smaller than that of healthy koalas, but all concentrations were smaller than reference concentrations in dogs and people. Fructosamine concentration did not allow the diabetic koala to be distinguished from healthy koalas and concentrations of all koala analytes were greater than expected for healthy dogs and people. Histopathological examination revealed extensive degeneration of pancreatic islet cells and fatty infiltration of hepatocytes. Immunoperoxidase staining revealed decreased or absent insulin in the b cells of the affected koala. Conclusion Clinical signs, clinicopathological results and histopathological changes were consistent with diabetes mellitus. The pathogenesis of the condition could not be determined but may have been related to the administration of a parenteral corticosteroid preparation, the stress of capture or tissue damage and inflammation.

AB  - Background Endoscopic skull-base surgery (ESBS) is employed in the management of diverse skull-base pathologies. Paralleling the increased utilization of ESBS, the literature in this field has expanded rapidly. However, the rarity of these diseases, the inherent challenges of surgical studies, and the continued learning curve in ESBS have resulted in significant variability in the quality of the literature. To consolidate and critically appraise the available literature, experts in skull-base surgery have produced the International Consensus Statement on Endoscopic Skull-Base Surgery (ICAR:ESBS). Methods Using previously described methodology, topics spanning the breadth of ESBS were identified and assigned a literature review, evidence-based review or evidence-based review with recommendations format. Subsequently, each topic was written and then reviewed by skull-base surgeons in both neurosurgery and otolaryngology. Following this iterative review process, the ICAR:ESBS document was synthesized and reviewed by all authors for consensus. Results The ICAR:ESBS document addresses the role of ESBS in primary cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea, intradural tumors, benign skull-base and orbital pathology, sinonasal malignancies, and clival lesions. Additionally, specific challenges in ESBS including endoscopic reconstruction and complication management were evaluated. Conclusion A critical review of the literature in ESBS demonstrates at least the equivalency of ESBS with alternative approaches in pathologies such as CSF rhinorrhea and pituitary adenoma as well as improved reconstructive techniques in reducing CSF leaks. Evidence-based recommendations are limited in other pathologies and these significant knowledge gaps call upon the skull-base community to embrace these opportunities and collaboratively address these shortcomings.

AB  - Summary Studies published in recent years have highlighted the role of epidermal barrier defects in both atopic skin disease and the development of broader allergic manifestations. While genetic determinants of barrier function are important, it is clear that local acquired effects are also involved in disease pathogenesis. In this review, we aimed to summarize the known influences of cytokines abundantly expressed during atopic skin disease on components of epidermal barrier integrity and function.

AB  - Summary The prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases has increased dramatically over the past few decades with the highest incidence occurring in children. Most asthma and related atopic disorders have their origins in early life. Thus, it is imperative to understand the early life origins of the disease in order to identify targets for prevention and early intervention. Although atopic diseases have genetic determinants, the increased incidence of these diseases has occurred far too rapidly for genetic changes to explain the increase. This, most likely, results from changes in environmental influences acting on a pre-existent genetic susceptibility. One of the environmental changes over the last 20?40 years that could have contributed to the recent increase in atopic diseases is diet. Food allergy is often one of the earliest manifestations of atopy, and sensitization to food is a risk factor for the subsequent appearance of respiratory allergy and asthma. However, studies investigating the effects of dietary restrictions on the prevention of allergy have been disappointing. On the other hand, current data suggests that exclusive breastfeeding should be encouraged for at least 4?6 months in infants at both high and low risk of atopy. Increased risk of asthma has also been observed in low birth weight infants, suggesting that under-nutrition can detrimentally alter foetal development. Epidemiological and immunological studies also suggest that dietary modification or supplementation in the foetal and early life could reduce the development of atopic diseases. The current dietary hypotheses relate to antioxidants, lipids, electrolytes and probiotics. The aims of this report are: (i) to assess the best methods to analyse nutrient intake and nutrient status; (ii) to review the existing epidemiological evidence for an association between dietary intake (nutrients and food) and allergic diseases; and (iii) to define the windows of opportunity for nutritional supplementation to be used as a preventative strategy for asthma and allergy.

AB  - Biomedical textiles and fiber-based implants (BTFIs) have been in routine clinical use to facilitate healing for nearly five decades. Amongst the variety of biomaterials used, silk-based biomaterials (SBBs) have been widely used clinically viz. sutures for centuries and are being increasingly recognized as a prospective material for biomedical textiles. The ease of processing, controllable degradability, remarkable mechanical properties and biocompatibility have prompted the use of SBBs for various BTFIs for extracorporeal implants, soft tissue repair, healthcare/hygiene products and related needs. The present Review focuses on BTFIs from the perspective of types and physical and biological properties, and this discussion is followed with an examination of the advantages and limitations of BTFIs from SBBs. The Review covers progress in surface coatings, physical and chemical modifications of SBBs for BTFIs and identifies future needs and opportunities for the further development for BTFIs using SBBs.

We report a 30-year-old woman with multiple cystic nodules located on the neck, axillae and forearms as well as patchy scalp alopecia. Histopathological examination of the lesions was diagnostic of SM. Trichoscopy revealed pili torti and pili canaliculi. This patient represents an unusual clinical presentation of SM because of the presence of hair abnormalities.

AB  - Abstract Labeling embryonic cells to trace their motion is a classical experimental approach with a host of techniques being used to mark live cells and tissues. Genetically engineered fluorescent protein vectors (DNA plasmids) are a recent technology well suited to time-resolved studies of cellular motion in live embryos. DNA plasmids encoding fluorescent proteins can be introduced into cells using several methods, including electroporation, a technique used widely for analysis of tissue culture and embryonic cells. Here we describe a technique designed to introduce DNA plasmids into early gastrulation stage quail embryos, ex ovo. The method is effective, and with practice enables an investigator to direct the vectors to relatively confined regions of gastrulating embryos. The required electroporation chamber can be fabricated from common laboratory materials. We anticipate that using this method of labeling cells in a warm-blooded embryo, during gastrulation, will be a fruitful means of studying subsequent embryogenesis.

AB  - Abstract? Citicoline is a therapeutic agent widely used in the treatment of brain injury, for example in cerebrovascular disease or traumatic accidents. Unfortunately, the strong polar nature of this drug prevents it crossing the blood-brain barrier. In this paper, the possibility of efficiently trapping citicoline in liposomes to improve its therapeutic effects is reported. The citicoline-encapsulation efficiency, drug leakage and size analysis of various liposome systems were studied. The real therapeutic effectiveness of these citicoline liposome formulations was evaluated by biological assay. The effects of free and liposome encapsulated citicoline on survival rate of ischaemic reperfused male Wistar rats (80?100 g) were investigated. Of the phospholipid mixtures used in citicoline liposome formulation the best in terms of delivery and therapeutic effects was 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-phosphocholine:dipalmitoyl-dl-Î±-phosphatidyl-l-serine: cholesterol (7:4:7 molar ratio). This phospholipid mixture was also assayed for brain conjugated diene levels in rats, since this parameter is an index of lipid peroxidation in rat cerebral cortex during post-ischaemic reperfusion. A citicoline-loaded phospholipid mixture has produced an increase in rat survival rate of about 24% and a reduction in diene levels of 60%, compared to the free drug.

AB  - Abstract Objective We aimed to study the occurrence and development of axonal pathology and the influence of astrocytes in vanishing white matter. Methods Axons and myelin were analyzed using electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry on Eif2b4 and Eif2b5 single- and double-mutant mice and patient brain tissue. In addition, astrocyte-forebrain co-culture studies were performed. Results In the corpus callosum of Eif2b5-mutant mice, myelin sheath thickness, axonal diameter, and G-ratio developed normally up to 4 months. At 7 months, however, axons had become thinner, while in control mice axonal diameters had increased further. Myelin sheath thickness remained close to normal, resulting in an abnormally low G-ratio in Eif2b5-mutant mice. In more severely affected Eif2b4-Eif2b5 double-mutants, similar abnormalities were already present at 4 months, while in milder affected Eif2b4 mutants, few abnormalities were observed at 7 months. Additionally, from 2 months onward an increased percentage of thin, unmyelinated axons and increased axonal density were present in Eif2b5-mutant mice. Co-cultures showed that Eif2b5 mutant astrocytes induced increased axonal density, also in control forebrain tissue, and that control astrocytes induced normal axonal density, also in mutant forebrain tissue. In vanishing white matter patient brains, axons and myelin sheaths were thinner than normal in moderately and severely affected white matter. In mutant mice and patients, signs of axonal transport defects and cytoskeletal abnormalities were minimal. Interpretation In vanishing white matter, axons are initially normal and atrophy later. Astrocytes are central in this process. If therapy becomes available, axonal pathology may be prevented with early intervention.

AB  - PURPOSE: To review the role of excitatory neurotransmitters in normal mammalian brain function, the concept of excitotoxic neuronal death as an important final common path in a variety of diseases, and modification of excitatory synaptic transmission as an important new pharmacological principle. These principles are discussed, with special emphasis on diseases of importance to older adults. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search from 1966 to May 1995 was undertaken, as well as a manual search of current issues of clinical and basic neuroscience journals, for articles that addressed glutamate N-methyl-D aspartate and/or excitotoxicity. STUDY SELECTION: A total of 5398 original and 68 review articles were identified that addressed animal and human experimentation relevant to excitotoxic neuronal death. There were 364 articles with potential significance for clinical application identified; 132 of the most recent references are provided. DATA EXTRACTION: All articles were classified into three categories: general receptor, biology pathogenesis of disease, and pharmacotherapy. RESULTS: Glutamic and aspartic acids are the physiological mediators of most excitatory synaptic transmission. This is critical to several normal nervous system functions, including memory and long-term modification of synaptic transmission and nociception. Activation of the inotropic NMDA and non-NMDA receptors increases transmembrane calcium and sodium fluxes, and the metabotropic glutamate receptor activation results in generation of inositol triphosphate and inhibition of adenylate cyclase. Numerous modulatory sites exist, especially on the NMDA receptor. Nitric oxide, arachidonic acid, superoxide, and intracellular calcium overload are the ultimate mediators of neuronal death. Glutamate re-uptake transporters belong to a unique family of amino acid transport systems, the malfunction of which is intricately involved in disease pathogenesis. Ischemic stroke, hypoglycemia, Parkinson's disease, alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and chronic pain syndromes are only some of the important clinical neurological disorders with a major pathogenic role for the excitatory amino acids. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological manipulation of the excitatory amino acid receptors is likely to be of benefit in important and common diseases of the nervous system. Only a few of the currently available drugs that modify excitatory neurotransmission, such as remacemide, lamotrigine, and tizanidine, have an acceptable therapeutic index. The identification of numerous receptor subtypes, topographic variabilities of distribution, and multiple modulatory sites will provide a true challenge to the neuropharmacologist.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Uterus transplantation has recently proved that infertility in women with uterine factor infertility can be cured. It is still an experimental procedure with numerous critical details remaining to be established, including tolerance to warm and cold ischemic insults. In preparation for human uterus transplantation trials, most teams use the sheep as a model system for research and team training, since the vasculature and the uterus is of similar size as in the human. We, therefore, aimed to develop an ex vivo sheep uterus reperfusion platform that mimics the reperfusion situation so that initial assessments and comparisons can be performed without the need for costly and labor-intensive in vivo transplantation experiments. Material and methods Isolated sheep uteri were perfused with the preservation solution IGL-1 and were then exposed to cold ischemia for either 4Â (nÂ =Â 6) or 48Â hours (nÂ =Â 7). Uteri were then reperfused for 48Â hours under normothermic conditions with an oxygenated recirculating perfusate containing growth factors and synthetic oxygen carriers. Histological and biochemical analysis of the perfusate was conducted to assess reperfusion injury. Results Quantification of cell density indicated no significant edema in the myometrium or in the endometrium of uteri exposed to 4Â hours cold ischemia and then a normothermic ex vivo reperfusion for 48Â hours. Only the outer serosa layer and the inner columnar luminal epithelial cells were affected by the reperfusion. However, a much faster and severe reperfusion damage of all uterine layers were evident during the reperfusion experiment following 48Â hours of cold ischemia. This was indicated by major accumulation of extracellular fluid, presence of apoptotic-labeled glandular epithelial layer and vascular endothelium. A significant accumulation of lactate was measured in the perfusate with a subsequent decrease in pH. Conclusions We developed a novel ex vivo sheep uterus model for prolonged perfusion. This model proved to be able to distinguish reperfusion injury-related differences associated to organ preservation. The experimental setup is a platform that can be used to conduct further studies on uterine ischemia- and reperfusion injury that may lead to improved human uterus transplantation protocols.

AB  - Acting in the interfaces between environment and membrane compartments, membrane ion channels, and receptors transduce various physical and chemical cues into downstream signaling events. Not surprisingly, these membrane proteins play essential roles in a wide range of cellular processes such as sensory perception, synaptic transmission, cellular growth and development, fate determination, and apoptosis. However, except insulin and insulin-like growth factor receptors, the functions of membrane receptors in animal lifespan modulation have not been well appreciated. On the other hand, although ion channels are popular therapeutic targets for many age-related diseases, their potential roles in aging itself are largely neglected. In this review, we will discuss our current understanding of the conserved functions and mechanisms of membrane ion channels and receptors in the modulation of lifespan across multiple species including Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, mouse, and human.

AB  - Abstract In patients with breast cancer, metastases of cancer cells to the axial skeleton may cause excruciating pain, particularly in the advanced stages. The current drug treatments available to alleviate this debilitating pain condition often lack efficacy and/or produce undesirable side effects. Preclinical animal models of cancer-induced bone pain are key to studying the mechanisms that cause this pain and for the success of drug discovery programs. In a previous study conducted in our laboratory, we validated and characterised the rat model of Walker 256 cell-induced bone pain, which displayed several key resemblances to the human pain condition. However, gene level changes that occur in the pathophysiology of cancer-induced bone pain in this preclinical model are unknown. Hence, in this study, we performed the transcriptomic characterisation of the Walker 256 cell line cultured in vitro to predict the molecular genetic profile of this cell line. We also performed transcriptomic characterisation of the Walker 256 cell-induced bone pain model in rats using the lumbar spinal cord and lumbar dorsal root ganglia tissues. Here we show that the Walker 256 cell line resembles the basal-B molecular subtype of human breast cancer cell lines. We also identify several genes that may underpin the progression of pain hypersensitivities in this condition, however, this needs further confirmatory studies. These transcriptomic insights have the potential to direct future studies aimed at identifying various mechanisms underpinning pain hypersensitivities in this model that may also assist in discovery of novel pain therapeutics for breast cancer-induced bone pain.

AB  - Summary Neuropathic pain remains an extremely challenging condition to manage clinically, with few effective options for analgesia. The hallmark of neuropathic pain is a mixed loss and gain of function in somatosensation and pain, which is secondary to an initiating lesion to the nervous system. Clinical research into the distinctive somatosensory profiles exhibited by individuals with different types of neuropathic pain will soon improve the design of clinical trials that assess the effects of therapeutics on the different dimensions of neuropathic pain. A variety of model systems have been developed to investigate the peripheral and central nervous system pathology seen in clinical pain conditions triggered by traumatic injury, toxic neuropathy and other conditions. The biology illustrated by these models has proven difficult to translate into novel analgesic therapies. But recent evidence for a broader role of the immune system in neuropathic pain provides a new avenue for therapeutic development.
