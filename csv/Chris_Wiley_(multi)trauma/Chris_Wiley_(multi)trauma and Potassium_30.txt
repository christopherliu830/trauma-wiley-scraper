AB  - Abstract Preclinical Research Central nervous system (CNS) disorders represent a major problem of health in developed countries, with important consequences in disability and health economics. Recent findings in CNS genomics and pharmacogenomics suggest that the introduction of pharmacogenomic procedures in clinical practice may help to optimize therapeutics (efficacy and safety issues). The genes involved in the pharmacogenomics of CNS drugs fall into five categories: (i) genes associated with CNS pathogenesis; (ii) genes associated with the mechanism of action of drugs; (iii) genes associated with drug metabolism; (iv) genes associated with drug transporters; and (v) pleiotropic genes involved in multifaceted cascades and metabolic reactions. Pharmacogenomics accounts for 30?90% variability in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Only 20?30% of the Caucasian population processes normally approximately 60% of the current drugs that are metabolized via CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Clinical pharmacogenomics may contribute to personalizing pharmacological treatment, predicting patient/drug-dose selection, minimizing drug interactions, increasing drug efficacy, and reducing unnecessary costs.

AB  - Abstract The challenge of finding an adapted scaffold for ligament tissue engineering remains unsolved after years of researches. A technology to fabricate a multilayer braided scaffold with flexible and elastic poly (l-lactide-co-caprolactone) (PLCL 85/15) has been recently pioneered by our team. In this study, polyelectrolyte multilayer films (PEM) with poly-l-lysine (PLL)/ hyaluronic acid (HA) were deposited on this scaffold. After PEM modification, polygonal (PLL) and particle-like (HA) structures were present on the braided scaffold with no significant variation of fibers Young's modulus. Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSC) and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) showed good metabolic activity on scaffolds. They presented a spindled shape along the fiber longitudinal direction, and crossed the fibers to form cell bridges. Collagen type I, collagen type III, and tenascin-C secreted by MSCs were detected on day 14. Moreover, one-layer modified scaffold presented increased chemotaxis. As a conclusion, our results indicate that this braided PLCL scaffold with one-layer PEM modification shows inspiring potential with satisfying mechanical properties and biocompatibility. It opens new perspectives to incorporate growth factors within PEM-modified braided PLCL scaffold for ligament tissue engineering and to recruit endogenous cells after implantation. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Nutrition has become more than just the provision of energy substrates, amino acid building blocks, and maintenance of vitamin and mineral concentrations. It is apparent that certain nutrients (antioxidants, fish oil omega-3 fatty acids, glutamine, arginine, probiotics) and glycemic control exhibit the ability to enhance the immune response to a variety of stressors in critically ill veterinary patients and that their administration may have survival benefit. Acute protein-energy malnutrition predisposes to impaired immune competence; poor wound healing and an increased incidence of dehiscence; an increased incidence of wound infection and systemic sepsis; cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle weakness; and major organ failure and death. In addition, hepatic lipidosis is a common consequence of acute malnutrition in the cat. Enteral feeding should be used any time the intestinal tract (motility, digestion, and absorption) is functional. Enteral nutrition preserves gut epithelial structure and function better than does parenteral nutrition.

AB  - Summary Nutritional management of critically ill children (CIC) is a very specialist and challenging area in paediatric practice. A knowledge of metabolic changes and fuel utilisation during physiological stress can assist dietitians in commencing nutritional support at the appropriate time and suggesting a suitable feeding route and feed composition. Critical illness is characterised by a cascade of endocrine and metabolic reactions, affecting all major organs. During critical illness immune cells, e.g. macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils, regulate the inflammatory response through the release of cytokines and chemokines. Anthropometry, biochemical markers, clinical and dietary review form part of the nutritional assessment in CIC. This chapter describes the effect of nasogastric versus nasojejunal feeding and continuous feeds versus bolus feeding. A probiotics is a live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance.

AB  - WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT ??The mean catalytic activities of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes (HLM) of Japanese origin were found to be lower than the corresponding mean values of Caucasian HLM, but the distribution patterns of data in these studies were not well addressed. ??Interindividual variations in metabolic activities of Chinese HLM samples were reported for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, but little is known about the difference in CYP activities between Chinese and Caucasian HLM samples. ??The vast majority of the preceding studies were based on the measurement of metabolite formation rates at a certain fixed substrate concentration, rather than enzyme kinetic analyses. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS ??Significant differences in metabolic capability were observed for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2E1 with the median values lower for the Chinese HLM samples vs. the Caucasian samples, which were associated with differences in Michaelis constant or maximum velocity. ??Despite negligible differences in metabolic capability for CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2D6 and CYP3A, Michaelis constant of CYP2B6 appeared to have a significant ethnic difference. AIM The most common causes of variability in drug response include differences in drug metabolism, especially when the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are involved. The current study was conducted to assess the differences in CYP activities in human liver microsomes (HLM) of Chinese or Caucasian origin. METHODS The metabolic capabilities of CYP enzymes in 30 Chinese liver microsomal samples were compared with those of 30 Caucasian samples utilizing enzyme kinetics. Phenacetin O-deethylation, coumarin 7-hydroxylation, bupropion hydroxylation, amodiaquine N-desethylation, diclofenac 4?-hydroxylation (S)-mephenytoin 4?-hydroxylation, dextromethorphan O-demethylation, chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation and midazolam 1?-hydroxylation/testosterone 6?-hydroxylation were used as probes for activities of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A, respectively. Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess the differences. RESULTS The samples of the two ethnic groups were not significantly different in cytochrome-b5 concentrations but were significantly different in total CYP concentrations and NADPH-P450 reductase activity (P < 0.05). Significant ethnic differences in intrinsic clearance were observed for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2E1; the median values of the Chinese group were 54, 58, 26, and 35% of the corresponding values of the Caucasian group, respectively. These differences were associated with differences in Michaelis constant or maximum velocity. Despite negligible difference in intrinsic clearance, the Michaelis constant of CYP2B6 appeared to have a significant ethnic difference. No ethnic difference was observed for CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2D6 and CYP3A. CONCLUSIONS These data extend our knowledge on the ethnic differences in CYP enzymes and will have implications for drug discovery and drug therapy for patients from different ethnic origins.

AB  - Abstract The amniotic fluid has been identified as an untapped source of cells with broad potential, which possess immunomodulatory properties and do not have the ethical and legal limitations of embryonic stem cells. CD117(c-Kit)+ cells selected from amniotic fluid have been shown to differentiate into cell lineages representing all three embryonic germ layers without generating tumors, making them ideal candidates for regenerative medicine applications. Moreover, their ability to engraft in injured organs and modulate immune and repair responses of host tissues, suggest that transplantation of such cells may be useful for the treatment of various degenerative and inflammatory diseases. Although significant questions remain regarding the origin, heterogeneous phenotype, and expansion potential of amniotic fluid stem cells, evidence to date supports their potential role as a valuable stem cell source for the field of regenerative medicine.

AB  - Research on fisheries bycatch and discards frequently involves the assessment of reflex impairment,injury, or blood physiology as means of quantifying vitality and predicting post-release mortality, but exceptionally few studies have used all three metrics concurrently. We conducted an experimental purse seine fishery for Pacific salmon in the Juan de Fuca Strait, with a focus on understanding the relationships between different sublethal indicators and whether mortality could be predicted in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) bycatch. We monitored mortality using a ~24-h net pen experiment (N = 118) and acoustic telemetry (N = 50), two approaches commonly used to assess bycatch mortality that have rarely been directly compared. Short-term mortality was 21% in the net pen experiment (~24 h) and estimated at 20% for telemetry-tagged fish (~48?96 h). Mortality was predicted by injury and reflex impairment, but only in the net pen experiment. Higher reflex impairment was mirrored by perturbations to plasma ions and lactate, supporting the notion that reflex impairment can be used as a proxy for departure from physiological homeostasis. Reflex impairment also significantly correlated with injury scores, while injury scores were significantly correlated with plasma ion concentrations. The higher time-specific mortality rate in the net pen and the fact that reflexes and injury corresponded with mortality in that experiment, but not in the telemetry-tagged fish released into the wild could be explained partly by confinement stress. While holding experiments offer the potential to provide insights into the underlying causes of mortality, chronic confinement stress can complicate the interpretation of patterns and ultimately affect mortality rates. Collectively, these results help refine our understanding of the different sublethal metrics used to assess bycatch and the mechanisms that can lead to mortality.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) results in paraplegia or quadriplegia, and currently, therapeutic interventions for axonal regeneration after SCI are not clinically available. Animal studies have revealed that glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) plays multiple beneficial roles in neuroprotection, glial scarring remodeling, axon regeneration and remyelination in SCI. However, the poor physicochemical stability of GDNF, as well as its limited ability to cross the blood?spinal cord barrier, hampers the development of GDNF as an effective therapeutic intervention in clinical practice. In this study, a novel temperature-sensitive heparin?poloxamer (HP) hydrogel with high GDNF-binding affinity was developed. HP hydrogels showed a supporting scaffold for GDNF when it was injected into the lesion epicenter after SCI. GDNF-HP by orthotopic injection on lesioned spinal cord promoted the beneficial effects of GDNF on neural stem cell proliferation, reactive astrogliosis inhibition, axonal regeneration or plasticity, neuroprotection against cell apoptosis, and body functional recovery. Most interestingly, GDNF demonstrated a bidirectional regulation of autophagy, which inhibited cell apoptosis at different stages of SCI. Furthermore, the HP hydrogel promoted the inhibition of autophagy-induced apoptosis by GDNF in SCI. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part A: 105A: 2816?2829, 2017.

AB  - Abstract Leukoencephalopathies are a broad class of common neurologic deterioration for which the etiology remains unsolved in many cases. In a Chinese Han family segregated with sensorineural hearing loss and leukoencephalopathy, candidate pathogenic variants were identified by targeted next-generation sequencing of 144 genes associated with deafness and 108 genes with leukoencephalopathy. Novel compound heterozygous mutations p.R477H and p.P505S were identified in KARS, which encodes lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS), as the only candidate causative variants. These two mutations were functionally characterized by enzymatic assays, immunofluorescence, circular dichroism analysis, and gel filtration chromatography. Despite no alteration in the dimer-tetramer oligomerization and cellular distribution by either mutation, the protein structure was notably influenced by the R477H mutation, which subsequently released the protein from the multiple-synthetase complex (MSC). Mutant LysRSs with the R477H and P505S mutations had decreased tRNALys aminoacylation and displayed a cumulative effect when introduced simultaneously. Our studies showed that mutations in KARS lead to a newly defined subtype of leukoencephalopathy associated with sensorineural hearing impairment. The combined effect of reduced aminoacylation and release of LysRS from the MSC likely underlies the pathogenesis of the KARS mutations identified in this study.

AB  - Abstract Objective of review Surgical site infections are a recognised complication of cochlear implant (CI) surgery with significant morbidity. Our aim was to search for the optimum prevention and management strategy to deal with this issue. Type of review Systematic review. Search strategy A systematic literature search was undertaken from the databases of Embase, CINAHL, MEDLINE?, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane Library according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Evaluation method All relevant titles, abstracts and full-text articles were reviewed by two authors who resolved any differences by discussion and consultation with senior authors. Results Fourteen articles were included in our review. The overall quality of evidence was low with the vast majority of the studies being retrospective case series and expert opinions. No randomised controlled trials were noted. We found consistent reports that intraoperative prophylactic antibiotics should be given to all patients undergoing CI and that the vast majority of CI wound infections had grown Staphylococcal spp. or Pseudomonas spp. Conclusion Our review has not identified any reliable or reproducible strategies to prevent and deal with wound infections after CI. We strongly encourage further research within this field and would suggest that a consensus of opinions from a multidisciplinary panel of experts may be a pragmatic way forward as an effective guide.

AB  - Abstract Few studies have investigated cardiac arrhythmias during spaceflight. Atrial and ventricular premature contractions, short-duration atrial fibrillation, and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia were reported by previous spaceflight programs. Some of these arrhythmias occurred following extravehicular activity in space. Arrhythmias during spaceflight are related with hypokalemia, microgravity, changes in the autonomic nervous system, and physical stress. Some astronauts have needed radiofrequency catheter ablation for atrial arrhythmias. Future long-duration spaceflights beyond the Earth's orbit may expose astronauts to significant levels of radiation that affect the coronary arteries. Genetic tests for arrhythmias might be added to the present cardiac screening examinations in the future.

AB  - In connection with an osteological study of more than one hundred complete, disarticulated skeletons of the Norwegian Fjord and D?le horse breeds in the collection of the University Museum of Bergen, attention was drawn to the ossified parts of the rib cartilages because of frequent healed fractures transverse to the cartilages. Unossified cartilage had been removed, so the ossified cartilages were available as dry specimens. The skeletons derive from pedigreed stallions as well as some few mares, so both name, year of birth and age are known. Most often the age was between 15 and 30?years, but some few horses were younger, the youngest 5-year-old. Ocular inspection of each skeleton revealed that healed fractures occurred in ossified rib cartilages of every horse, varying from some few instances to >30. Skeletons of horses of other races in the museum collection corroborated this. Healing of the fractures was obvious. Four kinds were observed: The first, and probably least sincere fracture appeared as a visible transverse ring, the second displayed callus elevation around the fracture, the third showed dislocation and callus formation, and the fourth concerns pseudoarthrosis, when fractured parts fail to unite during healing. Even a fifth kind may be considered, with circumferential callus formation leaving the interior healed but unfused. X-ray displays the fractures as white, cross-sectional bands of bone repair. However, such fractures appear not to be considered in contemporary veterinary pathology, but the large number of fractures observed in some cases, callus formation and dislocation of fractures in others, indicates that some period following these fractures is likely to have been traumatic to the horse, so that fracture of ossified rib cartilages should not be ruled out concerning horses showing unexplained symptoms of pain.
