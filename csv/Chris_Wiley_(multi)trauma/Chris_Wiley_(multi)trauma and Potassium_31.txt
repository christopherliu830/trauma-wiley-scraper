AB  - In connection with an osteological study of more than one hundred complete, disarticulated skeletons of the Norwegian Fjord and D?le horse breeds in the collection of the University Museum of Bergen, attention was drawn to the ossified parts of the rib cartilages because of frequent healed fractures transverse to the cartilages. Unossified cartilage had been removed, so the ossified cartilages were available as dry specimens. The skeletons derive from pedigreed stallions as well as some few mares, so both name, year of birth and age are known. Most often the age was between 15 and 30?years, but some few horses were younger, the youngest 5-year-old. Ocular inspection of each skeleton revealed that healed fractures occurred in ossified rib cartilages of every horse, varying from some few instances to >30. Skeletons of horses of other races in the museum collection corroborated this. Healing of the fractures was obvious. Four kinds were observed: The first, and probably least sincere fracture appeared as a visible transverse ring, the second displayed callus elevation around the fracture, the third showed dislocation and callus formation, and the fourth concerns pseudoarthrosis, when fractured parts fail to unite during healing. Even a fifth kind may be considered, with circumferential callus formation leaving the interior healed but unfused. X-ray displays the fractures as white, cross-sectional bands of bone repair. However, such fractures appear not to be considered in contemporary veterinary pathology, but the large number of fractures observed in some cases, callus formation and dislocation of fractures in others, indicates that some period following these fractures is likely to have been traumatic to the horse, so that fracture of ossified rib cartilages should not be ruled out concerning horses showing unexplained symptoms of pain.

AB  - The ischemia-reperfusion seen in dogs with gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) could cause oxidative stress, decrease antioxidant capacity, and predispose patients to higher morbidity and mortality. Elevated lactate levels in dogs with GDV have been previously found to be a negative prognostic indicator. The purpose of this study was to serially evaluate oxidant and antioxidant concentrations in dogs with GDV and to determine if there is a correlation between the degree of antioxidant depletion and lactate levels. Dogs presenting to the Tufts Emergency Service that had not been treated with corticosteroids or fluids prior to admission and were not receiving antioxidant supplementation were eligible for the study. Blood samples were collected at the time of initial catheter placement pre-operatively (Time 0), and then 24 and 48 hours after surgery. The samples were analyzed for concentrations of oxidants [malondialdehyde (MDA), oxygen radical trapping capacity (ORAC) and F2 isoprostanes] and antioxidants (α-tocopherol, ? -tocopherol, vitamin C, and glutathione peroxidase). ANOVA with repeated measures was used to evaluate differences in the variables over the 48-hour period and Pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the relationship between 2 continuous variables. To date, 8 dogs have been enrolled in the study (1 female and 7 males, with a mean age of 8.0±2.2 years). All dogs have survived to discharge. The chart below indicates differences in parameters measured during hospitalization. Variable Time 0?median (range) 24 hours?median (range) 48 hours?median (range) P?Value MDA (nmol/L) 0.725 (0.532?1.250) 0.500 (0.423?0.870) 0.512 (0.388?0.890) 0.008 α-tocopherol (ug/ml) 16.350 (3.800?29.400) 11.300 (6.760?30.800) 12.950 (7.850?40.400) 0.000 ?-tocopherol (ug/ml) 0.402 (0.138?0.776) 0.293 (0.000?0.500) 0.300 (0.000?0.503) 0.501 Mean plasma lactate upon admission was 4.3?mmol/L (range 2.1?7.2?mmol/L). There was a positive correlation between ?-tocopherol and lactate (r=0.784, P=0.012) but there were no correlations between lactate and MDA or α-tocopherol. Additional dogs are currently being enrolled in the study and analyses of the other variables (ORAC, F2 isoprostanes, vitamin C, and glutathione peroxidase) are pending. These preliminary results support the hypothesis of alterations in oxidant and antioxidant parameters in dogs with GDV.

AB  - Objective: To determine if 1) administration of a neuroleptanalgesia sedative combination (hydromorphone-diazepam) would result in alteration of heart rate and fractional shortening parameters and 2) if administration of a neuroleptanalgesia sedative combination (hydromorphone-diazepam) prior to administration of a dissociative sedative combination (ketamine-diazepam) would blunt increases in heart rate and fractional shortening parameters previously reported with the use of dissociative-based sedation. Design: Single blinded, randomized, crossover design. Animals: Eleven privately owned healthy cats with normal echocardiograms. Procedure: All cats received each of the following injections with at least one week separating each treatment: Treatment A (TA) ? saline IM followed in 15?minutes by diazepam (0.2?mg/kg IM) and hydromorphone (0.2?mg/kg IM) combined in the same syringe; Treatment B (TB) ? saline IM followed in 15?minutes by ketamine (6?mg/kg IM) and diazepam (0.2?mg/kg IM) combined in the same syringe; Treatment C (TC) ? diazepam and hydromorphone combined in the same syringe followed in 15?minutes by ketamine and diazepam combined in the same syringe. Echocardiograms were performed using the right parasternal position 15?minutes after the second injection. Heart rate (HR) and parameters to determine fractional shortening (FS) in the short axis view were recorded in triplicate for each treatment group. An analysis of variance for repeated measures with a Fisher's LSD protected t-test was used for statistical analysis. Results: Fractional shortening was significantly increased in each treatment group compared to baseline (p<0.05). There was a significant increase in FS between TA and TB (p<0.05), TA and TC (p<0.05), but not between TB and TC (p=0.9). Heart rate was not significantly increased between baseline and TA. There was a significant increase in HR between baseline and both TB and TC (p<0.05), but not between TB and TC (p<0.05) Conclusion: The increase in fractional shortening induced by dissociative-based chemical restraint in normal cats is not blunted by the prior administration of a neuroleptanalgesia combination. The increase in fractional shortening following administration of the neuroleptanalgesia combination may have been due to an indirect increase in sympathetic tone (stress response).

AB  - Improved options for the successful transport of horses trapped in inaccessible areas (floodwater, steep ravines, etc.) during a disaster or emergency are available to practitioners using helicopter assets and the Anderson Sling?. Horses present a particularly difficult problem to remove from the rescue environment of a wide flooded area, or difficult steep terrain far from access by vehicles or heavy equipment. Due to their fractious and fearful nature, they may fight any effort to walk, climb or swim them to safety, and those attempts are inherently very dangerous for the rescuer(s). Unfortunately, many disaster or emergency scenarios may occur in areas not conducive to the use of other options (barge, rescue glide, simple vertical lift sling). Veterinary practitioners on scene should have familiarity with helicopter sling-load operations. The use of cargo nets, inappropriate home-made slings, and inadequate equipment has contributed to disastrous efforts by well-intentioned rescuers. There have even been desperate attempts at sling loading of cattle by roping the horns or one leg and transporting them into a waiting truck for removal from public lands. The Anderson Sling? has been successfully used for helicopter operations in multiple emergencies and training demonstration flights, and is the only Equine Sling recommended for this purpose. Although it was originally intended for clinical use in long-term recovery cases, it has become the industry standard for helicopter operations with equines because of its demonstrated safety margin, design and strength. In clinical use, leg straps further distribute the animal's weight to the legs, but are not necessary in rescue lifts. In some states, there are Large Animal Rescue Teams associated with the Veterinary School, the State Emergency Management Association, or local private Equine Ambulance Services that may have equipment and personnel trained in helicopter sling-loading. This is a specialty interest that requires prior coordination, significant planning, and training of all personnel involved.

AB  - Objectives: 1) Validate a chromogenic assay to measure Factor Xa inhibitory activity (anti-Xa activity) in normal feline plasma and following administration of low molecular weight heparins and unfractionated heparin. 2) Compare the effects of two commercially available low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), unfractionated heparin (UFH), and placebo on TEG, anti-Xa activity, PT/aPTT, PCV/TS and platelet count in healthy cats. Methods: Our study consisted of two phases: 1) the evaluation of a commercially available chromogenic anti-Xa assay (Rotachrom Heparin, Diagnostic Stago) for use in cats, and 2) the evaluation of hemostatic effects of LMWH in healthy cats. Phase 1: The anti-Xa assay was validated for use in cats using feline plasma and serial dilutions of the plasma spiked with UFH, enoxaparin, and dalteparin. Phase 2: Five healthy cats were included in a randomized Latin Squares model crossover-design to compare the effects of UFH and LMWH in cats. The cats then received one of the following subcutaneously: 1) 250?IU/kg UFH QID, 2) 100?IU/kg dalteparin BID, 3) 1?mg/kg enoxaparin BID, 4) 0.25?mL/kg 0.9% saline (placebo) QID. A minimum of a two-week washout period separated each treatment period. Each drug was administered for 5 days. Blood samples were obtained to measure anti-Xa, TEG, PT/aPTT, platelet count, and PCV/TS on Days 1, 3, 5, and 6 of each treatment cycle. Samples were collected at time 0 on each sample day for all parameters and on select days at hours 4, 8, and 12 for anti-Xa and TEG. Results: Preliminary results using the validated anti-Xa assay (from the first part of this study) demonstrate that LMWH treatment results in peak anti-Xa activity at the 4-hour sampling time that returned toward baseline by 8 hours (in 5/6 cats treated with LMWH thus far). Similar anticoagulant effects were noted in the TEG parameters of cats receiving LMWH (i.e., peak effects were noted at 4 hours). Analysis of current data by linear regression identifies a relationship between anti-Xa measurements and TEG parameters for cats treated with all heparin therapies (p<0.001). A similar relationship exists between anti-Xa and aPTT. Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest an anticoagulant effect of LMWH in cats that may not be uniform across individuals. Anti-Xa activity or TEG may provide useful tools for monitoring LMWH.

AB  - Clostridium tetani infection is uncommon in dogs and cats. Up to this point in time just single case reports have been published in veterinary medicine. The goal of this retrospective study was to describe the clinical features and outcome of 13 dogs and one cat affected with Clostridium tetani. The medical records of the last ten year were reviewed. Dogs and cats that were identified as being infected with Clostridium tetani on the basis of characteristic clinical signs and/or bacterial culture from infected wounds were eligible for study inclusion. Thirteen dogs and one cat met the criteria for study inclusion. Six different breeds and mix-breed dogs were affected, German Shepherd dogs (n=4, 29%) and Labrador retriever (n=3, 21%) were the most frequently affected breeds. Observed clinical complications were ventricular aspiration pneumonia (n=7), laryngeal spasm (n=6), hypersalivation (n=4), ventricular tachycardia (n=3), and third degree AV block (n=1). Median days from onset of clinical signs until first signs of improvement were 10 days (range: 9?12 days). Median hospitalisation time was 18 days (range: 14?22 days). Six animals showed full recovery and 8 animals died or were euthanized. Death was associated with acute onset of ventricular tachycardia in 2 dogs, 1 dog died with non-responsive third degree AV-block, 3 dogs died after developing aspiration pneumonia, and 1 dog died of unknown causes.

AB  - The Rescue Glide Sked provides a practical means of moving a recumbent, non-ambulatory or injured horse from the site of an accident. Horses with serious injuries, displaying severe malnutrition or neurological symptoms, can be easily moved out of a stall or even down a trail to a horse ambulance for transport to a veterinary facility. It is a specialty cut piece of 8?? 4? recycled polypropylene with tie-down straps and steel attachment points for winch loading into an equine ambulance. A horse must be fully sedated during transport on the rescue glide to prevent further injury to itself or rescuers. Moving a recumbent horse is very difficult due to the weight of the animal, often causing damage to the head and eyes, and with many safety concerns for the rescuers (struggling, kicking). It may take 8 to 10 people to move a horse just a few feet, especially uphill or on high friction surfaces. Benefits of the Rescue Glide include that the plastic reduces the friction of the weight of the animal on the ground surface, so fewer people are needed to move the animal. The tough resilient plastic is flexible so it goes easily over obstacles such as logs, roots, or through ditches. It folds up around the animal's body to get through a standard stall door or tight spaces as might be encountered on a trail. The Glide may be attached to a winch, ropes pulled by human rescuers, or even vehicle (ATV, car, etc.) The practical use of the Rescue Glide has been demonstrated in numerous situations including severe limb injuries, neurological compromise, geriatric, recumbent/unable to rise, severe neglect/malnutrition, and recovery/removal of dead large animals. The equipment has been used at race tracks and riding competition events for transport of animals into ambulances, as well as by veterinary rescue response teams in trail riding accidents, pasture accidents, and severe trailer injuries. The Rescue Glide, in conjunction with an equine ambulance trailer, provides a safe and suitable means of transport of large animals to veterinary facilities and should be a part of the equine practitioner's emergency equipment.

AB  - The primary classes of drugs used for pain control in horses include the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), the alpha-2 agonists, and the opiates, but each of these drug classes has significant adverse effects. Ketamine hydrochloride is a non-competitive antagonist at N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the spinal cord and has been used in both dogs and humans to provide analgesia. The purpose of this study was to identify a safe administration rate for a continuous infusion of ketamine to awake horses and describe the clinical effects of this infusion. Six horses were administered a continuous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride at a low dose (0.4?mg/kg/hr) and high dose (0.8?mg/kg/hr). Each infusion took place over 6 hours and the horses were monitored during infusion as well as for the 6 hours post-infusion. The following parameters were evaluated: heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, activity level, and analgesic thresholds. Both the low dose and high dose rates were tolerated well by all horses with no signs of excitation or discomfort. Post-infusion heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure were significantly decreased as compared to pre-infusion values (p=0.02 and p=0.02, respectively) A significant increase in analgesic threshold was not identified. Subanesthetic infusions of ketamine to awake horses appear to be well tolerated and cause only mild changes in clinical parameters. Further research is needed to evaluate the analgesic potential of these infusions.

AB  - Objective: To determine the amount of time required to reach the highest concentrations of oxygen at the patient's face and to determine what these highest concentrations of oxygen were with various non-invasive methods of providing supplemental oxygen using a commercial oxygen content analyzer. Procedure: Three healthy cats and 3 healthy dogs were each individually given supplemental oxygen by 6 different means, each done at 2 rates (5?L and 15?L per minute). The methods tested were: 1) Plastic sheet over conventional cage door (PSCD); 2) Blow-by where the tubing delivering the oxygen was held 8?cm from the face (BB); 3) Large plastic bag covering the patient (BAG); 4) Anesthesia induction chamber (AIC); 5) Synder oxygen cage (SOC); and 6) Crowe Oxygen E-Collar (COC). Prior to the testing, the commercial oxygen content analyzer (Mini-Ox) was calibrated. Results: Significant repeatable differences were consistently observed between the 6 methods of oxygen delivery. Results of both 5?L and 15?L/min oxygen flow rates consistently indicated that the highest oxygen concentrations were achieved with the anesthesia induction chamber and large plastic bag with oxygen concentrations reaching approximately 95% and 90%, respectively between 5 to 15?min. The BAG method had the advantage of allowing additional room for patient manipulation and the ability to place intravenous catheters while continuing to give supplemental oxygen. The plastic sheet covering a conventional cage door provided oxygen concentrations of 50% and 60% at 15 and 45?min, respectively. The Crowe Oxygen E-Collar achieved oxygen concentrations of 70% in 1.5?min. Blow-by was found to be the simplest method. It increased FiO2 to 40% within 2?min. The Synder oxygen cage was able to achieve 45% oxygen concentration within 30?min with an oxygen flow rate of 15 L/min. It was able to achieve 60% at 45?min (similar to the plastic bag on the cage). Conclusion: The order of effectiveness of providing non-invasive oxygen supplementation, from the highest to the lowest concentrations, was AIC, BAG, COC, PSCD, SOC, and BB. The fastest to the slowest increases in oxygen concentrations followed the same order at both 5?L and 15?L/min oxygen flow rate and they were BB, COC, AIC, BAG, PSCD, and SOC. SOC was the most inefficient means of providing oxygen while AIC, BAG and COC were the most efficient.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish reference values of respiratory mechanics and diffusion capacity in awake llamas for the interpretation and diagnosis of respiratory disease in critically ill camelids. The following procedures were performed in 10 healthy adult llamas (2?9 years; 100?204?kg): Respiratory Inductive Plethysmography and Pneumotachography (RIP) for the assessment of thoraco-abdominal synchrony and airflow obstruction (Hoffman, J Appl Physiol 2001;91: 2767?75), diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) and functional residual capacity (FRC) via helium dilution, esophageal balloon-pneumotachography to determine pulmonary resistance (RL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn), as well as Monofrequency Forced Oscillatory Mechanics (FOM) (Young, J Appl Physiol 1994;76:2467?72) to establish respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs) at the oscillatory frequencies of 1,2,3,5 and 7?Hz. RIP was further performed in 3 camelid patients to determine the cause of respiratory failure. The results of conventional lung mechanics, FOM (1?Hz), DLCO and FRC in healthy llamas are listed in the table below. Rrs at 1?Hz (closest to breathing frequency) was positively correlated with RL (P=.05). The calculated mean resonant frequency was 3.37 (+/?0.68) Hz. RIP results showed a peak difference between plethysmographic flow (V'sum) and nasal flow (V'n) of 2.61 (+/?1.02) during expiration (PEsf), and 2.48 (+/?1.04) during inspiration (PIsf). The area difference between V'sum and V'n was 0.05 (+/?0.14) and 0.05 (+/?.04) during the first 25% of expiration (SFEx) and inspiration (SFIx), respectively. Noninvasive evaluation of respiratory mechanics in clinical patients was essential to establish severity, type and progression of respiratory disease, especially in camelids presenting for upper airway obstruction, pulmonary disease or thoraco-abdominal asynchrony.

AB  - It has been recognized that a percentage of clone calves suffer from persistent pulmonary hypertension of the neonate (PPHN). It has been proposed by some investigators that an imbalance between vasoconstrictors, such as endothelin (ET-1) and vasodilators (such as NO) are involved in the genesis of the problem. Additionally, some clone calves and human infants are refractory to more traditional therapy or require prolonged treatment for PPHN and these patients appear to have increased smooth muscle in their pulmonary small resistance vessels suggesting chronicity. ET-1 is a known mitogen of vascular smooth muscle. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate ET-1 concentrations in the blood of clone, the blood of their surrogate dams and in fetal fluids to investigate the utility of using these fluids for prepartum evaluation of the clone. Blood was collected from calves and their surrogates at the time of delivery into heparin tubes; the plasma was separated by centrifugation and frozen until assayed. Fetal fluid samples were also obtained and frozen. Endothelin-1 concentration was determined using a commercially available RIA. Oxygen-dependent calves were those calves requiring, at a minimum, intranasal oxygen insufflation at rates of 5 or more L/min to maintain SPO2 values of >90%. Samples were obtained from a total of 40 calves; 13 calves were considered to be oxygen dependent and 27 calves were deemed non-oxygen dependent. Plasma ET-1 concentrations tended to be larger in oxygen-dependent calves (2-sample T test; p=0.16). Fetal fluid ET-1 concentration was significantly larger in the oxygen-dependent group (2-sample T test; p=0.0003). No difference between groups was detected in ET-1 measured in the blood of the surrogates; however, maternal blood ET-1 concentration was weakly but significantly correlated with fetal fluid ET-1 concentration overall (Correlation=0.456; p=0.007) and the correlation was stronger within the oxygen dependent group (Correlation 0.780; p=0.002). These data suggest that ET-1 may play a role in pulmonary function abnormalities in clone calves in the immediate post-partum period.

AB  - The fundamental changes in body composition which accompany surgical illness are loss of body protein, gain in extracellular water, and erosion of body fat stores. The rate at which each of these processes occurs and the balance between them determine the clinical picture observed and an understanding of them opens the door to intelligent management of many complex disorders. Recent advances in technology have lent impetus to body composition research and a number of new findings have major implications for clinical practice. In this review, some of the work from the body composition laboratories in the University Department of Surgery at Auckland Hospital will be described with special emphasis on that which is directly relevant to the practising surgeon.

AB  - A new closure technique developed for lateral thoracotomy approaches in emergency surgeries was used to close 20 thoracotomies in 5 cats and 15 dogs, and the results were compared retrospectively to a previously recommended and published technique. The continuous shoe-lace technique involved the use of monofilament 2?0 (cats) to 2 sized (large dogs) polypropylene on a swaged on taper needle. The closure pattern began at the dorsal aspect of the intercostal opening just caudal to the caudal rib and then moved to just cranial to the cranial rib. The pattern continued in a continuous fashion, placing a suture bite every 1?2?cm (cats) to every 3?4?cm (large dogs). At the ventral aspect of the incision, the closure continued back dorsally with a continuous lacing-like pattern. At the conclusion of the pattern dorsally the sutures on each side of the incision were pulled tight. The opening between the ribs was brought together with this tightening. The single knot was then tied. Results revealed a more rapid closure than the conventional closure (averaging 10?minutes versus 20?minutes, respectively). No dehiscence was observed with either technique. The single knot was able to be tied without any difficulty. No other complications were observed. This study proved that the new closure technique was very effective. It is recommended over the routine previously accepted and published method because of increased speed and less suture material buried. This is especially helpful in emergency surgery where surgery time needs to be as short as possible.

AB  - Because of the cost and complexity of treating immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) cases, it is important to find accurate prognostic factors. Most information to date has come from retrospective university studies with varying treatment protocols. To better identify prognostic indicators in cases diagnosed with IMHA, a prospective study with a standardized treatment protocol was undertaken. Diagnosis of IMHA was based on standard published criteria and effective rule out of other diseases. For each IMHA case admitted, historical, treatment and clinical data were documented during hospitalization. All discharged cases were followed for at least 3 months. Of 31 cases originally enrolled in the study, 26 cases were available for analysis in determining chance for discharge and 21 cases were available in determining longer term prognosis. All cases were autoagglutinating. Eighteen cases were discharged (69%), 1 case died, and 7 cases were euthanized in the hospital due to a grave prognosis. Cases that died or were euthanized in the hospital had a significantly higher maximum total bilirubin (Tbili) level than those that were discharged (33.5 versus 4.8, p=0.0004). Between cases that were discharged and those that died or were euthanized, there was no difference in age, packed cell volume, white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count or Tbili on admission, or the presence of hemoglobinuria or hemoglobinemia. The number of transfusions received and hospitalization time were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Only 3 animals had been vaccinated within 2 months; of those, 1 was euthanized and 2 were discharged. Three-month follow-up information was available for 13 of the 18 cases discharged. Of the 13, 7 cases were still alive at 3 months (7/21, 33%). There was no difference in age, PCV, WBC, platelet count, total bilirubin at admission, number of transfusions received, or hospitalization time between survivors and non-survivors. None of the animals that lived over 3 months had hemoglobinemia or hemoglobinuria during their hospitalization. Maximum Tbili was significantly higher in non-survivors versus survivors (23.7 versus 1.9, p=0.0005). A total bilirubin of greater than 5.16 during hospitalization was associated with an extremely poor prognosis.

AB  - Introduction: Gastric acid suppression is a recommended therapy for gastric ulceration. Human studies suggest that optimal healing of duodenal ulcers occurs at gastric pH >3 for 75% of the day. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 4 gastric acid suppressants at recommended veterinary doses. Drug effect was based on the 24-hour median pH and the percentage of time that the intragastric pH ≥3 in a 24 hour period. Methods: The study was conducted in 12 healthy Beagle dogs and was a double-blind, randomized, multiple cross-over comparison of a placebo (saline IV q12?h), ranitidine 2?mg/kg IV q12?h, famotidine 0.5?mg/kg IV q12?h, pantoprazole 1?mg/kg IV q24?h, and omeprazole (unblinded) ?1?mg/kg PO q24?h. Continuous 24-hour intragastric pH measurements were obtained via PEG tube. Prior to drug testing, 24-hour pH measurements were recorded in fasted and fed dogs. Thereafter, dogs were fed standardized meals throughout the remainder of the study period. Drugs were administered for 1 week with a one-week washout period between tests. Data were obtained on Day 0 (baseline), Day 2 and Day 6 of treatment. Following the randomized study, famotidine 0.5?mg/kg IV q8?h and omeprazole ?1?mg/kg + bicarbonate q12?h via PEG tube were evaluated in 6 dogs, respectively. Appropriate statistical analyses were applied to calculate the 24-hour median pH and percentage of time that the test drug maintained intragastric pH≥3 over 24 hours. Results: The 24-hour median pH of fasted dogs was 4.44 vs. fed dogs 1.30 (p<0.0001). The % time pH≥3: fasted dogs 66.0% vs. fed dogs 13.3% (p<0.0001). The 24-hour median pH was (bold denotes significance when compared to saline) - saline pH 1.81, ranitidine Day 2?pH 2.53, Day 6?pH 2.05, famotidine Day 2?pH 2.83, Day 6?pH 3.68, pantoprazole Day 2?pH 3.11, Day 6?pH 3.49, omeprazole Day 2?pH 3.86, Day 6?pH 4.09. The % time pH≥3: saline 32.9%; ranitidine day 2 ? 44.6%, Day 6 ? 37.2%; famotidine: Day 2 ? 48.9%, Day 6 ? 60.1%; pantoprazole: Day 2 ? 54.2%, Day 6 ? 59.1%; omeprazole: Day 2 ? 66.9%, Day 6 ? 70.2%. The 24-hour median pH of omeprazole + bicarbonate q12?h was 4.7 on Day 2 and 4.9 on Day 6; the % time pH ≥3 was 90.9% on Day 2 and 78.4% on Day 6, respectively. No significant difference was noted in any parameter comparing famotidine q8?h and q12?h. Conclusions: Fasted dogs had a significantly higher pH than fed dogs. Omeprazole was the only drug tested that approached the potential therapeutic efficacy for healing of duodenal ulcers when assessed by criteria for human patients. Variation existed amongst dogs in all drugs tested.

AB  - Introduction: The amount of oxygen in blood is an important measure of lung function. There are three ways to quantify the amount of oxygen in blood: 1) the oxygen tension (PO2); 2) the percent of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen (HbO2); and 3) the absolute content of oxygen in the blood (ContO2). PO2 is commonly measured. HbO2 and ContO2 are usually calculated from the normal human oxyhemoglobin relationship, but can be measured directly. The canine curve is similar to, but not the same as, that of humans. The purpose of this study was to compare, in dogs, direct measurements of HbO2 and ContO2 with analyzer-calculated values derived using the human oxyhemoglobin curve, and with hand-calculated values derived using a canine oxyhemoglobin curve. Materials And Methods: Arterial and jugular venous samples from 17 healthy dogs were analyzed by an ABL 705 blood gas and electrolyte analyzer, an OSM3 co-oximeter, and a LexO2con oxygen content analyzer. HbO2 was calculated from the measured PO2 using a published formula based on normal canine data (Reeves, 1982), and compared to measured and analyzer-calculated values. ContO2 values were calculated, and compared to measured and analyzer-calculated values. Means and standard deviations were compared by analysis of variance for repeated measures. Differences were considered significant at p<0.05. Results: Arterial HbO2 determined by the ABL 705 factory-programmed algorithm, reported by the OSM3 co-oximeter, and calculated from Reeves' canine formula were significantly different (97.1±0.57, 98.2±0.58, and 96.6±0.74, respectively). The calculated canine HbO2 was significantly lower than that measured by the OSM3 or calculated by the ABL for both arterial and jugular venous samples. Calculated and measured arterial and venous ContO2 were similar, as were arterial-venous ContO2 differences. However, values derived from the calculated canine HbO2 (canine-calculated) resulted in the greatest arterial-venous ContO2 difference. Conclusion: ABL-calculated and canine-calculated HbO2 were similar to measured values. Likewise, ABL-calculated, canine-calculated, and OSM3-calculated ContO2 were very similar to measured values. Although some of the values generated by the different methods are statistically significantly different, these differences are unlikely to be clinically important in the healthy dog.

AB  - Our laboratory developed a customized solution containing various free-radical scavengers, energy sources, and vasodilators in an attempt to attenuate intestinal injury following an ischemic insult. This solution has been evaluated with beneficial effects following low flow ischemia and reperfusion using in vitro and in vivo models using intra-arterial and intraluminal administration. In both investigations, the solution minimized morphologic injury and decreased transmucosal leakage of albumin. Objective: To determine if the systemic administration of the solution (GI Boost) had any clinical effect on normal horses, and to summarize the outcome of horses undergoing colic surgery that received the solution intravenously and intraluminally. Animals: 5 healthy adult horses and at the time of submission the outcomes of 10 horses undergoing abdominal surgery for colic. Methods: 2 L of GI Boost was administered at concentrations of 25%, 50%, and 75% intravenously (IV) to 5 normal horses. Parameters evaluated included CBC, chemistry panel, blood pressure, and physical examination. In 10 clinical cases, GI Boost was administered IV (intra-op and post-op) and intraluminally via the enterotomy. Results: The administration of GI Boost did not produce any clinical or hematologic abnormalities in normal cases. None of the clinical cases developed any complications associated with the use of the solution. The majority of horses were discharged from the hospital and 1 died following large colon rupture. Clinical Relevance: The administration of GI Boost may have a beneficial effect in horses presented for colic. Additional cases continue to be acquired to determine if this solution has a beneficial effect relative to traditional methods of treatment.

AB  - A technique for placement of a long-term arterial catheter that the author developed was used in 20 canine patients. The catheter was used for pressure monitoring and arterial blood sampling. The technique involved the following steps post-sedation and placement of a local anesthetic: 1 Clipping and prepping of the medial aspect of the distal tibia and proximal metatarsal region; 2 Incision over the medial tibial malleolus just caudal to the cranial tibial muscle-tendon; 3 Blunt dissection of the space just caudal to the cranial tibialis tendon; 4 Isolation of the cranial tibial artery and loop placement proximally and distally; 5 Placement of a 3 Fr. polyurethane 4?8?cm catheter using a Seldinger wire technique; 6 Placement of a suture in the periosteium of the distal tibia and anchoring of the catheter with this suture; 7 Closure of the skin incision with sutures or staples; 8 Bandage application to hold the catheter in place. The entire surgical procedure was done using sterile technique. The catheter was able to be kept in place and working for up to 9 days (averaged 4 days). This compared favorably retrospectively over dorsalis pedis catheters that lasted only a maximum of 4 days. (average 1.5 days). Because of the size of the catheter (3 Fr.) it provided improved waveforms over that observed with the dorsalis pedis catheter (22?g) and its occlusion rate was very low (2 in 20). The cranial tibial artery catheter was found to be particularly effective because the catheter was able to be inserted several cm up the artery and the catheter was able to be anchored well. No major complications were observed with this technique. Because of its effectiveness it is recommended to be used routinely over femoral artery and dorsal pedis artery catheters.

AB  - Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication in the cat, carrying a mortality rate as high as 26% during initial hospitalization. In humans, the presenting laboratory values can be correlated with the length of hospitalization and survival. To our knowledge, no studies of this kind can be found in the veterinary literature. The objective of this study was to compare the duration of therapy and clinical outcome of cats with DKA based on laboratory values, and whether or not administration of sodium HCO3 had an impact on survival. Only completed medical records of cats treated at the Animal Emergency Center for DKA from January 1998 to January 2004 were reviewed. All patients received a standardized protocol for treatment of DKA. Data collected included presenting blood glucose level, presenting venous blood gas values, whether or not bicarbonate therapy was administered, length of hospitalization, and survival. Median duration of hospitalization of survivors was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method, and comparisons between groups performed using the log-rank test. Differences in laboratory values between survivors and non-survivors were compared using a one-sided unpaired t-test and Fisher's exact test. Twenty medical records fit the study criteria. There were 12 male and 8 female cats, of which 14 were released to owner care and 6 died in the hospital (5 euthanized). Median duration of hospitalization among survivors was 4.5 days. There was a trend toward increased hospital stay in cats presenting with a blood glucose >269?mg/dL (3 days versus 5 days; p=0.0685). There was a trend for nonsurvivors to have pCO2 <21.5?mmHg (p=0.063), and K+<3.65?mmol/L (p=0.063). Eight cats presented with HCO3 <10?mmol/L. Of these, 2 were administered sodium HCO3. In conclusion, there was no statistically significant correlation between presenting laboratory values and outcome of cats with DKA. Those presenting with a pCO2<21.5?mmol/L or K+<3.65 mEq/L may have a greater chance for morbidity. There does not appear to be an association between sodium HCO3 administration and outcome in these cats. Additional case evaluations would provide greater power in confirming the validity of these preliminary results.
