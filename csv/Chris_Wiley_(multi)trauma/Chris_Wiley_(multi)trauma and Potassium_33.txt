PY  - 1988
AB  - Abstract: Among 53 delirious patients with an electrolyte imbalance in the serum, the duration of delirium in 18 cases was significantly shortened by the correction of electrolyte imbalance, compared with that of 35 cases of delirium without an electrolyte correction. The mean duration of delirium (mean value ± SE) corrected by electrolyte was 9.4 ± 1.9 days, whereas the mean duration of delirium without the electrolyte correction was 25.7 ± 4.6 days. The mean duration of delirium in 13 cases without the electrolyte imbalance was 25.0 ± 6.6 days. From these results, the electrolyte correction should be done systematically for the delirious patients as a treatment for the disorder.

AB  - Abstract The majority of oral surgery patients do not require the input of a critical care department (CCD). However, oral surgeons working in secondary care may be involved in the management of such patients. This may be due to surgical complications or sequelae (predicted or otherwise) or for medical reasons. Oral Surgery trainees working within Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery departments are likely to be involved in managing patients whose presenting condition necessitates care within a CCD. This article gives an overview of the reasons for use of a CCD and some of its functions.

AB  - Abstract The increasing occurrence of hospital-acquired infections and the emerging problems posed by antibiotic-resistant microbial strains have both contributed to the escalating cost of treatment. The presence of infection at the wound site can potentially stall the healing process at the inflammatory stage, leading to the development of a chronic wound. Traditional wound treatment regimes can no longer cope with the complications posed by antibiotic-resistant strains; hence, there is a need to explore the use of alternative antimicrobial agents. Pre-antibiotic compounds, including heavy metal ions and essential oils, have been re-investigated for their potential use as effective antimicrobial agents. Essential oils have potent antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and other beneficial therapeutic properties. Similarly, heavy metal ions have also been used as disinfecting agents because of their broad spectrum activities. Both of these alternative antimicrobials interact with many different intracellular components, thereby resulting in the disruption of vital cell functions and eventually cell death. This review will discuss the application of essential oils and heavy metal ions, particularly tea tree oil and silver ions, as alternative antimicrobial agents for the treatment of chronic, infected wounds.

AB  - Abstract Ageing is associated with a decline in health and an increase in age-related disease. However, the rate of biological ageing is not consistent between individuals and is not completely determined by genes. The rate of ageing and health decline is influenced by the environment and can be manipulated experimentally (e.g. by regulating metabolism). This highlights the potential for appropriate nutrition in order to maintain metabolic health as we age. Such interventions could consequently increase health-span and quality of life of an ageing population. However, public health advice about nutrition, such as consumption of two portions of fish each week (one of which should be oily) and eating at least five portions of fruit and vegetables daily, is focused on the population as a whole. It may not address an older individual's specific nutrient requirements to maintain health during ageing. The InCluSilver project, supported by the European Union Horizon 2020 programme, seeks to address this challenge through personalised nutrition for older adults. Personalised dietary recommendations should be fine-tuned to an individual's age, health, phenotype/genotype, activity, preferences and/or motivations, and framed by evidence from clinical trials. However, currently the dietary evidence base in older adults is small. Long-term studies that investigate dietary modifications in older individuals who are malnourished or over-nourished are needed to inform potential strategies. A wider food perspective will be necessary for successful implementation of personalised nutrition to support healthy ageing. This may include technologies that enable users to monitor their nutritional and health status for the purpose of motivating dietary adherence.

AB  - Summary Necrotising fasciitis is a rare, life-threatening, soft-tissue infection characterised by rapidly spreading inflammation and subsequent necrosis of the muscle, fascia and surrounding tissues. We report a case of necrotising fasciitis originating from the shoulder in a 59-year-old female patient. Necrotising fasciitis of the shoulder is very rare and has a poor prognosis because of its potential to spread to the chest wall. It can occur in otherwise healthy people without any predisposing conditions and could present as muscle strain. Disproportionate pain is the hallmark of this condition. Ultrasound examination and aspiration of fluid from the involved area is a fast and efficient method of reaching the diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract The factors that delay wound healing are multiple and relate both to diabetes and to the effect of its complications. Diabetic foot ulcers readily become chronic, and chronic ulcers have biological properties that differ substantially from acute ones. Much of the available information on the biology of wound healing relates to acute and experimental wounds and may not be directly relevant. It follows that there is limited evidence currently available to underpin protocols for the management of diabetic foot ulcers, or to guide choice of applications and dressings 1. Nevertheless, it is possible to define certain principles. Glycaemic control The first relates to glycaemic control. While chronic complications of diabetes such as peripheral vascular disease and neuropathy may be largely irreversible, aspects of structure and function of connective tissue and cells may be impaired by hyperglycaemia, and their function should be improved if normoglycaemia is achieved. Promotion of healing The second principle concerns attempts at active promotion of wound healing by (1) surgical revascularization, and (2) specific attempts to correct defined biological abnormalities thought to be hindering the healing process. These include the use of a variety of applications, dressings and technologies, which may stimulate healing by applying, or stimulating the release of, growth factors and cytokines. While this approach holds the greatest promise for the future, it will be dependent on defining defects which need correction in specific individuals, and having technologies available to address them. This field is in its infancy. Wound care The third broad principle concerns the management of the wound and its surrounding tissue in order to promote healing. This includes regular inspection, cleansing and removal of surface debris, elimination of pathogenic bacteria and creation of an appropriate environment to facilitate endogenous tissue regeneration. There are many applications and dressings that may be chosen to promote healing, but, whichever is selected, wound management has to be integrated into an effective programme of multidisciplinary care.

These include Acanthamoeba, Acinetobacter, Actinomyces and Aelorostrongylus abstrusus. This chapters presents details such as the description, zoonotic potential, microbiology/epidemiology, clinical disease, diagnosis, treatment, drug therapy and drug therapy alternatives of each infection discussed environmental exposure to Acanthamoeba is common and typically does not result in infection. Acanthamoeba from corneal samples of cats with refractory conjunctivitis and keratitis. Dogs may present with clinical signs similar to distemper. Mild ocular discharge, anorexia, lethargy, and fever may occur early. Acinetobacter is a gram negative coccobacillus. Aelorostrongylus abstrusus is the most common lungworm of cats and is found worldwide. Diagnosis of A. abstrusus should be considered in any cats with respiratory signs, particularly outdoor cats that hunt. Treatment is difficult and not always required.
