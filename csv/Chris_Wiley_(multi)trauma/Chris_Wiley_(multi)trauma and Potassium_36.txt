AB  - Summary This chapter discusses some miscellaneous arrhythmias and cardiac conditions in canine and feline patients. The conditions dealt with in the chapter include arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, junctional escape beats, bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome (sick sinus syndrome), electrical alternans (pericardial effusion), left bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block, right bundle branch block, ST segment abnormalities, and T-wave abnormalities. Additionally, canine congestive heart failure (mitral valve insufficiency), canine dilated cardiomyopathy, feline aortic thromboembolism (saddle thrombus), feline congestive heart failure, heartworm (caval syndrome (CS)), and pericardial effusion are also discussed. For each condition, recognition, differentials and diagnostics, treatment and prognosis are explained. Some artificats and anomalies are discussed initially. All animals should be placed in right lateral recumbency for consistency. The lead placement need to be verified whenever an arrhythmia is detected. Machine standardization has to be checked, as this can result in complexes of too large or too small size.

AB  - Summary Tattooing has been around since the early beginnings of modern civilization. The discovery of selective photothermolysis at last has made it possible to remove tattoos without leaving a scar. Q-switched neodymium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet, alexandrite, and ruby lasers with pulse durations in the nanosecond domain fulfill this need. Argon or cw-CO2 lasers as well as intense pulsed light sources should not be used since they often produce significant scarring. This article provides an overview of current laser systems.Developments leading to new tattoo inks, feedback systems to detect the absorbance characteristics of tattoo inks, dermal clearing agents, and perhaps even lasers with shorter pulse-durations might improve the results in the future.

AB  - Summary Occupational health and safety in veterinary hospitals is a topic not always routinely considered but one that is of utmost importance. This chapter first gives an overview of common hazards and how to prevent them. Regular training, revision of safety procedures, plain old hand washing and common sense will help keep the workplace productive and healthy. The veterinary technician plays a very important role in the administration of medications. It is imperative that the veterinary technician has a full understanding of and the ability to relay information on; the indications for use, pharmacokinetics, contraindications, precautions, safety issues, adverse effects, drug interactions, and monitoring parameters of the medications they encounter in practice. Recognizing signs of pain and advocating pain management is a paramount element of patient care. It is well recognized that patients, both veterinary and human, suffer from longer hospital stays, greater complications, and increased mortality when pain is not controlled.

AB  - Abstract Neural regeneration devices interface with the nervous system and can provide flexibility in material choice, implantation without the need for additional surgeries, and the ability to serve as guides augmented with physical, biological (e.g., cellular), and biochemical functionalities. Given the complexity and challenges associated with neural regeneration, a 3D printing approach to the design and manufacturing of neural devices can provide next-generation opportunities for advanced neural regeneration via the production of anatomically accurate geometries, spatial distributions of cellular components, and incorporation of therapeutic biomolecules. A 3D printing-based approach offers compatibility with 3D scanning, computer modeling, choice of input material, and increasing control over hierarchical integration. Therefore, a 3D printed implantable platform can ultimately be used to prepare novel biomimetic scaffolds and model complex tissue architectures for clinical implants in order to treat neurological diseases and injuries. Further, the flexibility and specificity offered by 3D printed in vitro platforms have the potential to be a significant foundational breakthrough with broad research implications in cell signaling and drug screening for personalized healthcare. This progress report examines recent advances in 3D printing strategies for neural regeneration as well as insight into how these approaches can be improved in future studies.

AB  - Abstract Wearable devices (wearables) have recently gained significant traction and are predicted to dominate many areas of research over the next 5 years. Many wearables contain a host of sensors that feedback vital bodily parameters to a central system. Although many artificial sensors exist, the biggest challenge to medical wearables is to interface and harness the ?big data? set from the human bodies own complex sensor network to better allow early diagnosis and/or treatment and prevention of diseases that have a huge economic burden on society such as type II diabetes. Cybernetics and medicine are joining their forces to overcome the new challenges in developing smarter, more intuitive and smaller sensors that interface with the human sensory system. This review is focused on the interface of devices to ion-mediated transduction pathways both through G-Coupled Protein Receptors and direct or mechanically transduced ion pathways.

AB  - Summary The majority of critically ill patients requires the provision of analgesia and anaesthesia in order to perform diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedures at some point during their hospitalisation. The goal of anaesthesia in any critical patient is to maintain tissue and organ perfusion and ensure sufficient oxygen delivery and carbon dioxide removal. Pain management is an important consideration following initial examination of the severely injured patient. The most predictable response is achieved by using opioids with mu-receptor activity (morphine, methadone, fentanyl, buprenorphine). Acepromazine, benzodiazepines or alpha-2 receptor agonists are frequently co-administered with opioids to achieve a predictable sedative effect. The majority of veterinary clinics have the choice of two injectable agents for the induction of anaesthesia in routine cases ? propofol and alfaxalone. Using adjunctive techniques to provide pain control can reduce the inhalant dose requirement. This strategy is referred to as ?balanced anaesthesia'.
