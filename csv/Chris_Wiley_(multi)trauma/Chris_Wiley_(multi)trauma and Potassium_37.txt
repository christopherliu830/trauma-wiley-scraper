AB  - Abstract The increasing global prevalence of diabetes mellitus presents a significant challenge to healthcare systems today. Although diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy are well-established complications of diabetes, there is a paucity of research examining the impact of dysglycaemia on the olfactory system. Olfaction is an important sense, playing a role in the safety, nutrition and quality of life of an individual, but its importance is often overlooked when compared with the other senses. As a result, olfactory dysfunction is often underdiagnosed. The present review article aims to present and discuss the available evidence on the relationship between diabetes and olfaction. It also explores the associations between olfactory dysfunction and diabetes complications that could explain the underlying pathogenesis. Finally, it summarizes the putative pathological mechanisms underlying olfactory dysfunction in diabetes that require further investigation.

AB  - Although the enteral route of enteral feeding is the preferred method of nutrition support for critically ill patients, this important therapeutic strategy is not without risk. In human subjects, the digestion and absorption of nutrients induce typical hemodynamic changes, consisting of an increase in mesenteric blood flow at the expense of reduced systemic blood pressure. On rare occasion when providing aggressive enteral nutrition to critically ill patients, common symptoms of gastrointestinal intolerance may progress to a syndrome of abdominal distention, hypotension, and shock, with the development of small bowel ischemia or necrosis. Although the incidence of small bowel ischemia secondary to enteral feeding is low, the overall clinical outcome is still poor and carries a high mortality rate. Enteral feeding is well tolerated and is probably beneficial in most critically ill patients before and after a period of hypotension. Although enteral nutrition may be used with caution during the period of hypotension, evidence of poor gastrointestinal function (increased nasogastric tube output, unexplained abdominal pain, and abdominal distention), or development of dilated loops of bowel or intramural gas (pneumatosis intestinalis) on radiographic studies should be interpreted as potential indicators of gut ischemia. With progress in our understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and prevention of ischemic injury to the intestinal mucosa, the strategy of aggressive enteral feeding for critically ill patients may result in a reduction in this major complication and enhanced functional recovery from severe illness.

AB  - Clinical investigation of late onset Alzheimer's disease requires establishment of simple clinical and laboratory diagnostic criteria as neuropathological confirmation is not possible in the ordinary victim. Explicit criteria for the selection of mildly impaired victims in a 4-month trial of treatment and the need for new, more careful methods of dementia typing are discussed.

The combination of an abdominal CT scan and clinical findings led to the decision to perform an emergency laparotomy. Her persisting symptoms and laboratory results revealed her to be manifesting acute thyroid storm; TSH of <?0.10?IU.l?1, free T4 of 59.8?pmol.l?1 and free T3 of 20.20?pmol.l?1.

AB  - Purpose To quantify spatial and temporal inflammation-induced changes in vascular permeability and macrophage infiltration in guinea-pig (GP) cochlea using MRI. Materials and Methods GPs were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce cochlear inflammation. One group was injected with a gadolinium based contrast agent (GBCA) and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI was performed at 4, 7, and 10 days after LPS treatment. A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model was used to determine the apparent rate constant of GBCA extravasation (Ktrans). A second group was injected with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (USPIOs) and studied at 2, 3, and 7 days after LPS treatment to detect tissue USPIO uptake and correlate with histology. For both groups, control GPs were scanned similarly. Results The signal enhancement increased substantially and more rapidly at day 4 in LPS-treated than in control cochlea shortly following GBCA injection. Ktrans of LPS-treated cochlea was maximum on day 4 at 0.0218?±?0.0032 min?1 and then decreased to control level at 0.0036?±?0.0004 min?1 by day 10. In the second group, the relative signal intensity and T2 in cochlear perilymphatic spaces on day 2 decreased, on average, by 54% and 45%, respectively, compared with baseline and then remained under control levels by day 7. This suggests the infiltration of inflammatory cells, although unconfirmed by histology. Conclusion This provides the first measurement of cochlear vascular permeability using MRI and a quantitative evaluation of the development of cochlear inflammation. MRI holds considerable potential for the assessment of disease processes such as clinical diagnosis of conditions such as labyrinthitis. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Awareness and research on epilepsy-related deaths (ERD), in particular Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP), have exponentially increased over the last two decades. Most publications have focused on guidelines that inform clinicians dealing with these deaths, educating patients, potential risk factors and mechanisms. There is a relative paucity of information available for pathologists who conduct these autopsies regarding appropriate post mortem practice and investigations. As we move from recognizing SUDEP as the most common form of ERD toward in-depth investigations into its causes and prevention, health professionals involved with these autopsies and post mortem procedure must remain fully informed. Systematizing a more comprehensive and consistent practice of examining these cases will facilitate (i) more precise determination of cause of death, (ii) identification of SUDEP for improved epidemiological surveillance (the first step for an intervention study), and (iii) biobanking and cell-based research. This article reviews how pathologists and healthcare professionals have approached ERD, current practices, logistical problems and areas to improve and harmonize. The main neuropathology, cardiac and genetic findings in SUDEP are outlined, providing a framework for best practices, integration of clinical, pathological and molecular genetic investigations in SUDEP, and ultimately prevention.

AB  - The effects of total hepatectomy in a porcine model were studied. A portacaval shunt was constructed prior to hepatectomy, and the excised segment of inferior vena cava was replaced with a Dacron graft as soon as the liver had been removed. While the vena cava was clamped, venous return from the lower body to the heart was maintained using an extracorporeal veno-venous bypass system. The results of the study revealed that surprisingly few haemodynamic, biochemical or coagulation disturbances occur within the first 5 h following total hepatectomy in the pig, an animal with remarkably close anatomical and physiological similarities to man. In the anhepatic period which follows total hepatectomy during clinical liver transplantation, the situation is more complex, because pre-existing liver disease and portal hypertension, as well as major blood loss, often provide other reasons for metabolic and haemodynamic instability and coagulation disorders. The possible relevance of the findings in this large animal model to events that occur following total hepatectomy in the clinical situation is discussed.
