AB  - Reimbursement policies for health care services are greatly diminishing in the U.S. and Western Europe. Hence, there is an increasing need for doctors and other care givers to reduce costs without compromising the quality of the care being delivered. The clinical laboratory is viewed as an area of high costs where significant reductions have been targeted. Efficient utilization of laboratory services can be achieved by elimination of the general health panel, removal of old tests or those that provide redundant information, a reduction in the use of standing orders, more judicious use of drug assays, acceptance of clinical practice guidelines, and use of reflex testing algorithms. New technologies such as DNA probes can substantially improve diagnostic efficiency. Point-of-care testing devices which have higher costs than incremental central laboratory expenses should only be used if they reduce overall operating expenses. Implementation of expert systems can make remaining tests more effective. Doctors and laboratorians must collaborate to achieve more efficient utilization practices.

PY  - 1999
AB  - Abstract The aim was to evaluate the effect of HTK compared to UW and Euro?Collins (EC) on the initial graft function and long term graft survival in two prospective randomized studies. Only kidneys from heart-beating, kidney-only or kidney + heart donors were eligible for entry. Initial non-function (INF) was defined as the absence of life-sustaining renal function, requiring dialysis treatment on two or more occasions, during the first week after transplantation. To evaluate the contribution of the preservation solutions on INF in relation to other factors, a multivariate, 2-step logistic regression model was used. Randomization was performed between July 1990 and September 1992. The UW-HTK study comprised 342 donors and 611 transplants (UW: 168 donors and 297 transplants, HTK: 174 donors and 314 transplants). In the EC-HTK study 317 donors and 569 transplants were included (EC: 155 donors and 277 transplants, HTK: 162 donors and 292 transplants). INF occurred in 33 % of either HTK-(n = 105) or UW-(n= 99) preserved kidneys (P = NS), and in 29% of the HTK-(n= 85) and in 43% of the EC-(n= 119) preserved kidneys (P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed no significant influence of the preservation solution on the incidence of INF in the UW-HTK study, but factors contributing to INF were donor age, cause of death, retransplantation, and cold ischemic period. The EC-HTK study showed a significantly higher risk of INF, using EC as preservation, in addition to cold ischemic period and donor quality. The 3-year graft survival of HTK-preserved kidneys was 73 %, compared to 68 % for UW?preserved kidneys in the UW-HTK study (P = NS); while the 3-year graft survival of HTK preserved kidneys was 70 % compared to 67 % for EC-preserved kidneys in the EC-HTK study (P = NS). We can conclude that HTK is comparable to UW in its preservative abilities, using kidneys from heart-beating kidney-only donors, whereas EC as renal preservation solution should be avoided.

AB  - Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) represent a spectrum of diseases characterized by extensive rapidly progressive necrosis that may involve the skin, subcutaneous tissues, fascia or muscle. Their progress is extremely fast, leading often to sepsis and septic shock that ends up in multiple organ failure with abrupt and high mortality. A variety of classification systems have been developed based on parameters such as anatomic location of the disease or microbiology. There are a number of factors that predispose to the spread of these soft tissue infections, such as delays in recognition, immune suppression, diabetes mellitus and advanced age. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics tends to mask the severity of the underlying infection, modulates the clinical presentation, and even delays hospital admission. The most important factor affecting outcome in NSTI is early diagnosis and aggressive radical surgical treatment. The medical records of 13 patients who had been treated for NSTI from 1996 to 2005 were reviewed, retrospectively. There were eight men (61.5%) and five (38.5%) women. Mean age was 56?years (range 27?73). Seven cases of infection involved the perineal region (54%), two the lower limb, one the upper limb and three the abdominal wall/trunk. The most common associated comorbidity was diabetes mellitus in five patients (38.5%). A single organism was identified in two (15%) and multiple organisms in 11 (85%) patients. Necrotizing aponeurositis Type I was the most common of the polymicrobial necrotizing infections. Overall survival was 85%, and the mean hospital stay for survivors was 35 days (range 17?92).

AB  - Abstract Introduction Primary graft failure (PGF) is an important contributor to early mortality, accounting for 41% of deaths within the first 30 days after heart transplantation (HT). Donor hypernatremia has been associated with PGF development. However, controversial data exist regarding the impact of sodium deregulation in patient survival after HT. This study aimed to assess the influence of donor hypernatremia on PGF development and to determine the serum sodium level threshold to assist in decision-making for organ procurement. Methods The medical record from 200 HT patients and organ donors were retrospectively assessed and categorized by PGF occurrence. Donor sodium levels were compared and cut-off points obtained by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A multiple logistic regression model was applied to assess the effects of factors and covariates that influence PGF development. Results Sodium levels of donors were significantly higher in recipients who developed PGF than those who did not develop PGF (162 vs. 153 mmol/L, P = .001). The sodium cut-off value determined by the ROC curve was 159 mmol/L. The group who received organs from donors with a serum sodium concentration ≥159 mmol/L had a higher incidence of PGF (63.3% vs 32.4%, P < .001). Furthermore, donor sodium levels ≥159 mmol/L increased the likelihood of recipients developing PGF by 3.4 times. It is also observed that the incidence of donor smoking addiction was significantly higher in the PGF group (28.6% vs. 11.5%, P = .004) and donor smoking addiction increased the risk of developing PGF by 2.8 times. Conclusion Smoking addiction and the application of suboptimal organs from donors with hypernatremia contribute to primary graft failure in heart transplantation.

AB  - The advent of implantable biomaterials has revolutionized medical treatment, allowing the development of the fields of tissue engineering and medical bionic devices (e.g., cochlea implants to restore hearing, vagus nerve stimulators to control Parkinson's disease, and cardiac pace makers). Similarly, future materials developments are likely to continue to drive development in treatment of disease and disability, or even enhancing human potential. The material requirements for implantable devices are stringent. In all cases they must be nontoxic and provide appropriate mechanical integrity for the application at hand. In the case of scaffolds for tissue regeneration, biodegradability in an appropriate time frame may be required, and for medical bionics electronic conductivity is essential. The emergence of graphene and graphene-family composites has resulted in materials and structures highly relevant to the expansion of the biomaterials inventory available for implantable medical devices. The rich chemistries available are able to ensure properties uncovered in the nanodomain are conveyed into the world of macroscopic devices. Here, the inherent properties of graphene, along with how graphene or structures containing it interface with living cells and the effect of electrical stimulation on nerves and cells, are reviewed.
