AB  - Summary This chapter presents information on etiology/pathophysiology, signalment/history, clinical features, differential diagnosis, diagnostics and therapeutics of feline pancreatitis in cats and dogs. Local and systemic tissue injury is due to the activity of released pancreatic enzymes and a variety of inflammatory mediators, such as kinins, free radicals, and complement factors, released by infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages. The most common pathologies involving the feline pancreas include acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) and acute suppurative pancreatitis. Etiology is most often unknown. Serum pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (fPL) is a highly sensitive and specific serologic marker of acute pancreatic inflammation. fPL assay and pancreatic ultrasound in combination have the highest specificity for an antemortem diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration biopsy may confirm inflammation (cytology), abscess, or cygst.

AB  - Summary Patients referred to a nephrologist are subjected to a bewildering array of diagnostic tests and procedures. This chapter explains the procedures commonly undertaken in the diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease. It covers the tests including those involving blood and urine, radiological tests, invasive investigations, and methods of evaluating glomerular filtration rate. The chapter discusses investigations that are carried out prior to initiating anaemia treatments, such as erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs), as well as those used in cases of diminished response to ESAs. It evaluates the nurse's role in post-procedure care. The World Health Organization published guidelines on best phlebotomy practices, recommending standards for quality care that include laboratory sampling and the maintenance of quality control. Nurses must complete the necessary training before carrying out a new role, such as venepuncture.

Four investigators from the fields of molecular neuroscience, thalamocortical network physiology, transgenic animal physiology/behavior, and human/animal neuroimaging will serve as workshop speakers. To provide a basis for discussion, the speakers will use the first half of their presentation time to describe the relevant work from their respective laboratories. In the second half of their allotted presentation time, the speakers and workshop attendees will discuss how the results obtained in the speaker's experimental system address questions of IGE ictogenesis and epileptogenesis and complement the work done in other experimental systems. Participants will also use this time to ?workshop? new experiments that could be performed within the speaker's area of scientific expertise that would answer questions deemed important to IGE investigators from all disciplines.

An optimal therapy is lacking, and to date there has been no animal model that sufficiently replicates clinical features, so our understanding of mechanism is incomplete. Existing therapies are limited by effectiveness, availability or both. Yet, each of these challenges offers a unique opportunity to advance clinical and basic knowledge of this developmental epilepsy. This symposium will discuss recent advances about the clinical profile, therapeutic modalities, outcome, and mechanisms of infantile spasms. Dr. Nordli will review infantile spasms presentations and clinial features, especially variants. Dr. Lux will discuss current and future treatments. Dr. Carmant will discuss outcomes of infantile spasms. Finally, Dr. Stafstrom will consider emerging animal models that might shed light on infantile spasms mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract Aim Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic anti-fibrinolytic agent commonly used for the prevention and treatment of bleeding disorders. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical manifestation of TXA toxicity in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Methods From 2005 to 2014, we encountered four CKD patients who experienced severe complications related to TXA. Clinical manifestations and outcome of these patients were recorded. We then performed a qualitative literature review of published cases of TXA toxicity in CKD patients in the PubMed database from 1 January 1972 to 31 December 2015. Results In our centre, two peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients developed neurotoxicity after intravenous TXA use for surgical bleeding and one PD patient developed neurotoxicity after oral TXA use for post-polypectomy colonic bleeding. One kidney transplant recipient developed acute obstructive uropathy due to retention of blood clot at the pelvi-ureteric junction of graft kidney after taking oral TXA for menorrhagia. Dosage of TXA was not adjusted according to renal function in all cases. All of them recovered without permanent disability after TXA was stopped. From our literature search, we identified two cases of neurotoxicity (one PD, one stage 4 CKD patient), one case of retinal toxicity in a haemolysis (HD) patient, one case of ligneous conjunctivitis in a CKD patient, and one case of toxic epidermal necrolysis in a CKD patient. Conclusion Neurotoxicity is a very common clinical manifestation of TXA toxicity in CKD patients. Thrombotic complication is rare. Dosage adjustment of TXA is essential in CKD patients.
