AB  - Summary Dementia and cognitive impairment are very common and accompany many neurological as well as systemic diseases. This chapter first talks about delirium, dementia and cognitive impairment. Cognition, like other aspects of human brain function, has a modular organisation, and different cognitive functions have distinct anatomical substrates. The chapter then focuses on the differential diagnosis of delirium and dementia, and a structured approach to the investigation of cognitive impairment. Alzheimer's disease is the prototypical cortical dementia against which other dementias are compared in a differential diagnosis. The prion diseases are transmissible agents with unique composition and properties, being apparently devoid of significant nucleic acid. The greatest risk factor for development of dementia is age. However, there are several modifiable risk factors. Moderate exercise reduces the risk of dementia as does modification of vascular risk factors: obesity, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, hypertension and smoking.

AB  - One of the most frequently occurring presenting symptoms in dental practice is the oral pain condition of dentine hypersensitivity, which may be of only minor inconvenience to some patients and yet very disturbing and an issue affecting quality of life to others. Resolution of the aetiologies and the symptoms can be extremely difficult and frustrating, being both time consuming for clinician and patient. The aetiology of the condition is multifactorial, however over recent years the contribution of tooth erosion has escalated in magnitude. For dentine hypersensitivity to occur the lesion must be first localised on the tooth surface either through enamel loss, predominantly due to erosion; or dentine exposure due to gingival recession. Secondly, the lesion is initiated predominantly by erosion and abrasion by exposing dentine tubules on the tooth surface. More individuals are likely to experience this episodic pain condition due to the increasing longevity of the dentition and the rising prevalence of erosive toothwear. Conclusive evidence of successful treatment regimens is still elusive, despite a wide variety of products available for treatment. The two basic principles of treatment are altering fluid flow in the dentinal tubules or modifying the pulpal nerve response. These treatment regimens can be professionally applied in the dental practice, or at home by the patient. Desensitising toothpaste is the most common first line of treatment for use at home. Care should be taken to address the common predisposing conditions of gingival recession and acid erosion if long term success is to be achieved.

AB  - Abstract Over the last 6 years there have been ongoing efforts around the world to standardize nomenclature, definition, and evaluation of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome/painful bladder syndrome. The convergence this year of several new projects stimulated an effort to bring together thought leaders from around the world to give a snapshot of current thinking with regard to this disorder. The Society for Urodynamics and Female Urology brought together thought leaders from Europe, Asia, and the United States to Miami, and a broad, structured discussion ensued which is the subject of this report. The most appropriate name of the disease remains an area of contention. A final ?definition? of BPS/IC did garner substantial agreement among participants: An unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure, discomfort) perceived to be related to the urinary bladder, associated with lower urinary tract symptoms of more than 6 weeks duration, in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes. It seems that the world is moving to a presumptive diagnosis based on history and physical examination, and relying on invasive procedures for more complex cases, although this is by no means a universal opinion, being more prevalent in the United States and Asia than in Europe. It is hoped that the conference proceedings can serve as a basis for future efforts to develop formal definitions, guidelines, and best practice policies to further advancement of the field.

Abstract:? The pancreas allograft is a scarce resource that is currently underutilized. The selection of appropriate deceased donors for pancreas procurement is of paramount importance for minimizing technical failure and optimizing long-term outcomes in pancreas transplantation. Despite the increasing demand for pancreas transplantation, increases in overall organ donation rates and the evolution of criteria that constitute an ?acceptable? pancreas donor, the number of deceased donor pancreas transplants being performed in the United States has actually declined in recent years. Although there are many factors that must be considered during evaluation of the potential pancreas allograft donor to minimize morbidity and graft loss, it is evident that there are transplantable organs that are not used. In this review, deceased donor pancreas identification, management, selection, allocation, assessment, preservation, and the problem of pancreas underutilization will be discussed.

AB  - Summary This chapter covers all aspects of laboratory medicine including collection, handling, storage, and transport of specimens, as well as procedures and normal ranges. It gives information to understand and perform laboratory medicine. Blood chemistry tests are extremely useful diagnostic tools in veterinary medicine. They are used to evaluate various blood substances to help portray certain body and organ functions. Although many hospitals prefer to send out samples to reference laboratories for evaluation, the knowledge of how to perform a manual complete blood count can be very useful in certain situations, for example, when time is crucial during emergencies, when an automated machine is not functioning properly, or when an automated machine is not at hand. Having rapid results can give the veterinarian insight into the patient's hematologic status or provide information on certain types of anemia, organ functions, and neoplasia. The chapter describes the handling and collection techniques needed to obtain a proper microbial sample.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Five cases of cutaneous sporotrichosis were seen at the Stanford University Department of Dermatology from 1996 to 1977, where the disease was previously unreported. The possibility of sporotrichosis should be considered when suppurative cutaneous lesions do not respond to antibacterial agents. Skin biopsy of sporotrichotic lesion is often nonspecific, while culture is the best method of diagnosis.
