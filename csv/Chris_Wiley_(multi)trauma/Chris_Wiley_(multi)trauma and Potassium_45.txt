AB  - Abstract There is a need for analytical methods capable of monitoring blood antibiotic levels in real time. Here we present a method for quantifying antibiotic levels in whole blood that does not require any sample pretreatment. The tests employ the enzyme penicillinase to assay for penicillin G, penicillin V and ampicillin using a flow-injected biosensor, the Enzyme Thermistor. Optimal flow rates, sample volumes and pH were determined to be 0.5 mL/min, 100 ?L and 7.0, respectively. Analysis of the antibiotics diluted in buffer gave a linear range of 0.17?5.0 mM. Calibration curves prepared using blood spiked with the antibiotics gave a linear range of 0.17?2.0 mM. Linear regression values for all of the calibration curves were 0.998 or higher. Assay cycle time was 5 min. The relative standard deviation value for 100 determinations of a mock blood sample spiked with penicillin G was 6.71%. Despite the elimination of sample pretreatment, no detectable clogging or signal drift was observed. The assay provides a fast, simple, reliable analytical method for determining antibiotic concentrations in blood without the need for any sample pretreatment. This is an important first step towards developing a device capable of real-time monitoring of antibiotic levels in whole blood. The technology has the potential to significantly improve the outcomes of patients undergoing critical care.

AB  - Summary Pediatric intensive care units are quintessentially multidisciplinary units that care for patients of other physicians and must integrate all stakeholders, including the families and child, into the care delivery process. This chapter will review the major functions of the pediatric intensive care unit, and then discuss major organ system dysfunction and common diseases in critically ill children. This includes the cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, hematological, renal, and gastroenterological systems. Infection, sepsis, and systemic inflammatory response syndromes will also be discussed.

AB  - Summary A system was developed for objective prediction of survival, which could be applied to all critically ill patients, regardless of disease, at an early stage of hospitaluation. Such a system would allow risk assessment of groups for experimental studies according to probability of survival and it might allow us to avoid expenditure of scarce clinical resources on animals with little chance of survival. The prospective study included 200 critically ill dogs: 93 females and 107 males, representing 62 breeds. With survival defined as alive 30 days after admisssion to ICU the overall mortality rate was 40.5% (81 of 200 dogs). Data collected included signalment and parameters that reflected vital organ function, the severity of physiologic derangement and the extent of physiologic reserve. We recorded the most abnormal value for each parameter within 24 hours of admission to ICU and logistic regression analysis was used to analyze four different weighting systems. The best model had a concordance 0f 86.5% with outcome, and it was then re-evaluated to determine whether individual variables could be eliminated without losing predictive accuracy. Fourvariables were eliminated, resulting in a final model with 18 variables which had 86.3% concordance with outcome. At a 0.5 cut-off for predicted risk, the model had sensitivity Of 69%, specificity ficity of 86% and positive predictive value of 77%. A Receiver Operating Curve was constructed using serial cut-offs for predicted outcome from 0.1 to 0.9, and the area under the curve was 0.89. Thus, an equation was generated that gives an estimate of the probability of survival.

AB  - Elaine Wyllie 1 and Michael Duchowny 2 ( 1 Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH and 2 Brain Institute, Miami Children's Hospital, Miami, FL ) Summary: Epilepsy surgery is accepted as an appropriate intervention for children with medically refractory epilepsy. Key elements for surgical candidacy include a localized epileptogenic zone and a low risk for new postoperative neurological deficits. The strategies for identifying these elements for surgical candidacy are in evolution. This Symposium will examine current worldwide variations in pediatric epilepsy surgical practice, based on an international multicenter survey. Faculty will also examine age-related aspects to selection for surgery including lesion timing and type and functional plasticity, and strategies for surgery when MRI is normal or shows multiple lesions. Pediatric neurology and neurosurgery speakers will emphasize the tactics involved in designing a safe and effective plan for surgery for selected infants and children with intractable epilepsy.

AB  - Aims and objectives.? This study was undertaken to determine whether intensive care unit nurses possess adequate knowledge to implement the Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scoring system and to understand nurses? attitudes towards this scoring system. Design.? A questionnaire, which contained 20 multiple-choice questions to test knowledge of the scoring system and 27 statements with a five-points Likert type scale to assess attitude, was developed by researchers for this study. Methods.? The participants consisted of 102 intensive care unit nurses working in adult, emergency, or coronary intensive care units in a large teaching hospital (Veterans General Hospital) in Taiwan, where the APACHE II scoring system is used routinely by nurses. Results.? On the knowledge section of the questionnaire, 76% of the questions were answered correctly. However, more than 50% of the nurses were uncertain about how to score a patient's chronic history status, only 44.1% of the nurses knew that APACHE II total scores range from 0 to 71, and only 37.3% understood that the value for bicarbonate in venous samples could replace the arterial pH value. The results of the attitude questionnaire revealed that nurses believed APACHE II was useful mainly for statistical purposes by the administration rather than for patient care, but acknowledged that the scores could provide a reference for more aggressive treatment. Conclusions.? The questionnaire answers indicated that greater knowledge concerning the APACHE II is needed. Relevance to clinical practice.? Information and training concerning the proper use and purpose of APACHE II needs to be provided, especially for those intensive care unit nurses using this evaluation tool to score patients? conditions routinely.

There is increasing information, including recent epidemiological data regarding the long term outcomes of surgery, that suggests that the underlying basis for the disorder is more extensive than originally thought. The ultimate question for improving outcomes is ?What is the true focus for MTLE?? Although our understanding of what constitutes the focus remains limited, there is evidence from surgical outcome, pathology, imaging and animal studies that the hippocampus alone is not the answer. Outcome studies show that only a small percentage of patients who are seizure free following surgery for MTLE can successfully stop medications and remain seizure free. Further there is evidence that the number of patients in remission falls steadily, even after a period of seizure freedom. These observations suggest that the seizure focus has not been completely removed. Studies of the temporal lobe pathology demonstrate changes that are variable but which extend beyond the hippocampus. Imaging has been a key factor in identifying structural abnormalities, but we may be missing key pieces of information that could identify the focus more precisely. Animal studies indicate that the ictal onset zone may be extensive and extend well beyond the hippocampus, but a true understanding of the physical substrate for seizure initiation still eludes us. This session is asking questions for which we only have partial answers. What do we know now about the seizure focus in MTLE? What do we need to know to have better outcomes? We don't have any good answers for either question other than a) not enough and b) a lot more. We hope this session will stimulate the participants to fill in the many gaps that now exist.
