AB  - The course; of nine pigs which died shortly after liver transplantation was compared with that of the other nine which survived in a series of 18 consecutive transplants. The only significant differences were found to be the development of an inexorable metabolic acidosis, and the recognition of focal hepatic necrosis observed histologically in the non-survivors. The suggestion is made that progressive hepatic damage may develop, and may cause death in some animals which is not explained on obvious mechanical grounds.

AB  - Abstract Aquaporin-2 (AQP2), the vasopressin-regulated water channel of the renal collecting duct, is dysregulated in numerous disorders of water balance in people and animals, including those associated with polyuria (urinary tract obstruction, hypokalemia, inflammation, and lithium toxicity) and with dilutional hyponatremia (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis, congestive heart failure, cirrhosis). Normal regulation of AQP2 by vasopressin involves 2 independent regulatory mechanisms: (1) short-term regulation of AQP2 trafficking to and from the apical plasma membrane, and (2) long-term regulation of the total abundance of the AQP2 protein in the cells. Most disorders of water balance are the result of dysregulation of processes that regulate the total abundance of AQP2 in collecting duct cells. In general, the level of AQP2 in a collecting duct cell is determined by a balance between production via translation of AQP2 mRNA and removal via degradation or secretion into the urine in exosomes. AQP2 abundance increases in response to vasopressin chiefly due to increased translation subsequent to increases in AQP2 mRNA. Vasopressin-mediated regulation of AQP2 gene transcription is poorly understood, although several transcription factor-binding elements in the 5? flanking region of the AQP2 gene have been identified, and candidate transcription factors corresponding to these elements have been discovered in proteomics studies. Here, we review progress in this area and discuss elements of vasopressin signaling in the collecting duct that may impinge on regulation of AQP2 in health and in the context of examples of polyuric diseases.

AB  - ABSTRACT ?MALIGNANT HYPERTHERMIA (MH) usually is triggered during or after administration of commonly used general anesthetics, and it can result in death if left untreated. ?THE ONLY DEFINITIVE diagnostic test for MH is the caffeine halothane contracture test. A new molecular genetic diagnostic blood test may offer a less-invasive alternative for some patients. ?HYPERTHERMIA, the cardinal sign of MH, is a relatively late symptom. Other clinical signs include tachyarrhythmias, tachypnea, and acidosis. ?PERIOPERATIVE NURSES should perform MH risk assessments during routine preoperative interviews to identify patients at risk for MH crisis. Perioperative nurses must respond rapidly and ensure the cooperation of the OR team when dealing with MH. AORN J 83 (January 2006) 151?164.

AB  - Summary Angio-oedema (AE) is a known adverse effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) therapy. Over the past several decades, evidence of failure to diagnose this important and potentially fatal reaction is commonly found in the literature. Because this reaction is often seen first in the primary care setting, a review was undertaken to analyse and document the keys to both diagnostic criteria as well as to investigate potential risk factors for ACE-I AE occurrence. A general review of published literature was conducted through Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database, targeting ACE-I-related AE pathomechanism, diagnosis, epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical decision making and treatment. The incidence and severity of AE appears to be on the rise and there is evidence of considerable delay in diagnosis contributing to significant morbidity and mortality for patients. The mechanism of AE due to ACE-I drugs is not fully understood, but some genomic and metabolomic information has been correlated. Additional epidemiologic data and clinical treatment outcome predictors have been evaluated, creating a basis for future work on the development of clinical prediction tools to aid in risk identification and diagnostic differentiation. Accurate recognition of AE by the primary care provider is essential to limit the rising morbidity associated with ACE-I treatment-related AE. Research findings on the phenotypic indicators relevant to this group of patients as well as basic research into the pathomechanism of AE are available, and should be used in the construction of better risk analysis and clinical diagnostic tools for ACE-I AE.

AB  - Introduction: Much attention has been given to the development of osteonecrosis of the jaws, concomitant with a history of bisphosphonate usage, particularly regarding inciting dental procedures. This report describes a case of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the hard palate after the harvesting of a subepithelial connective tissue (CT) graft for treatment of gingival recession (GR) in the mandible. Case Presentation: A 60-year-old female sought periodontal therapy for GR. Her medical history revealed the use of alendronate for osteopenia, hypothyroidism, sulfa allergy, and >18 regimens of steroid formulations (oral, inhaled, and topical) for various upper respiratory and dermatologic disorders. The hard palate was selected as the donor site for the subepithelial CT graft. At a 4-month postoperative evaluation, osteonecrosis was evident in the palatal site. Successful clinical outcome was achieved after conservative debridement, antibiotics, and use of chlorhexidine gluconate. Conclusions: It is advised that a patient's medical history include current and past intake of bisphosphonates and comorbidities that could predispose to the development of osteonecrosis of the jaws. Attempts should be instituted to achieve primary wound closure of the donor site in patients who have taken bisphosphonates. Postoperative follow-up of the donor site of CT grafts should continue for at least 6 months for surveillance of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis.

AB  - 1 Elson L. So ( 1 Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN ) Some seizure disorders are known to be associated with excess mortality, and persons with epilepsy have been reported to have shorter life expectancies. Furthermore, concerted attention from both clinicians and researchers is needed to address the catastrophic condition of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). This program will identify epileptic conditions that are associated with increased risks for death, so that measures can be formulated and applied to reduce the risks. The necessity and the implications of counseling patients about the risk of SUDEP will also be discussed.
