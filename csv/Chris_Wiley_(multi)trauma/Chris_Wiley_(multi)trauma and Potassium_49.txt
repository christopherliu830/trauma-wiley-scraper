AB  - Summary This chapter introduces the reader to cardiopulmonary bypass as used to facilitate cardiac surgery in canine patients. It reviews challenges associated with this as a clinical tool and anesthesia management. The chapter also introduces the basics of circuitry and instrumentation used to facilitate cardiopulmonary bypass and the considerations (e.g., cardiac protection, management of coagulation) that arise as a result. It discusses the management of clinical canine patients where cardiopulmonary bypass is necessary to facilitate cardiac surgery. Although cardiopulmonary bypass offers ideal conditions for surgical intervention, the processes involved also generate real or potential negative effects on a multitude of organ systems. In addition to drugs used for anesthesia, numerous other medications should be available and in some cases drawn up. These include anticholinergics, inotropes, vasopressors, antiarrhythmics, dexamethasone, furosemide, electrolytes, sodium bicarbonate, heparin, an antifibrinolytic, a neuromuscular blocking agent, and protamine.

Efficacy and safety of Celsior preservation fluid in liver transplantation: one-year follow up of a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized study. ?Clin Transplant 2011 DOI: 10.1111/j.1399-0012.2011.01447.x. ?? 2011 John Wiley  p?=?0.398). Predictive factors for graft loss on univariate analysis were moderate-to-severe steatosis on the donor graft (5/22 patients with graft loss vs. 8/107 patients without, p?=?0.046) and duration of warm ischemia (1.4?±?1.1?h in patients with graft loss vs. 0.9?±?0.5?h in patients without, p?=?0.034). Hepatic artery thrombosis and stenosis occurred in seven (5.0%) and six (4.3%) patients, respectively. The comparison of our patients to 420 ELTR controls showed that one-yr graft survival rates (Celsior: 82.9%, 95% CI 75.8, 88.2; UW: 78.6%, 95% CI 74.4, 82.2) and Kaplan?Meier one-yr graft survival distributions (p?=?0.285) were similar. Within the cold ischemia time achieved in our study, liver preservation with Celsior appeared efficient and safe. Comparison with ELTR patients suggested that liver allograft survival was similar using Celsior or UW solution for preservation of unselected donor grafts.

AB  - 1 Elson L. So ( 1 Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN ) Some seizure disorders are known to be associated with excess mortality, and persons with epilepsy have been reported to have shorter life expectancies. Furthermore, concerted attention from both clinicians and researchers is needed to address the catastrophic condition of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). This program will identify epileptic conditions that are associated with increased risks for death, so that measures can be formulated and applied to reduce the risks. The necessity and the implications of counseling patients about the risk of SUDEP will also be discussed.

AB  - 1 Ajay Gupta, and 2 Mohamad Mikati ( 1 Department of Neurology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH ; and 2 Department of Neurology, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon ) There is a unique, apparently heterogeneous, group of epilepsy syndromes in children that is characterized by sleep activation of the epileptiform abnormalities with nearly continuous sharp waves seen on the scalp EEG during sleep. These include commonly recognized childhood conditions such as Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS), electrical status epilepticus in slow wave sleep (ESES), and benign rolandic epilepsy of childhood (BREC). Most of these children have a period of normal development and healthy childhood. Besides presenting with seizures that are often not too difficult to treat, these children have other major cognitive, behavioral and academic difficulties that are disproportionate to the burden of epilepsy and medications used to treat them. It is commonly believed that abnormal electrical activity in sleep per se leads to cognitive, behavioral, and academic difficulties in these children. However, the pathophysiological understanding of this phenomenon of sleep activation and its clinical implications are poorly understood. Moreover, there are also controversies regarding terminology, classification, and management of these disorders. Some experts believe that these conditions are distinct disease entities while others hypothesize that they may represent a spectrum of one condition. Similar sleep activation of epileptic discharges has also been reported in some other children with neuroimaging abnormalities in the deep gray nuclei. Some experts believe that the treatment with antiepileptic medications in these children should be titrated to the EEG response in sleep and not to the clinical response of seizures. It is unclear as to how often a sleep EEG should be done, and to what extent aggressive medical treatment and antiepileptic polytherapy be pursued. Use of steroids, recent success with high dose nightly benzodiazepine therapy, and surgical procedure like multiple subpial transactions in the insular regions continue to be controversial due to risk of serious side effects and modest benefits in reported anecdotal case reports and series. The focus of this symposium is to revisit these syndromes to: a) define the clinical spectrum of these conditions; b) formulate the best practices for management in the light of controversies in medical and surgical options; and c) discuss possible pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these disorders and probe future strategies for better treatment. Margret Shouse will show similarities between kindled epileptic kittens and sleep activation of EEG in children with these conditions. She will review the potential mechanisms and generators of EEG activity during sleep, discuss how the cognitive and behavioral sequelae may occur regardless of severe seizure burden. Edouard Hirsch will discuss the available clinical evidence to suggest that these ?disorders may be a clinical spectrum of one condition? and not distinct disease entities. He will also discuss diagnostic criteria and role of neuroimaging. Jim Rivello will review the available evidence, and emphasize the best clinical practices for management in these children. First, he will discuss the goals of treatment i.e. seizure control, behavior improvement, cognition monitoring, and sleep EEG improvement. Second, he will formulate a treatment and follow-up plan with indications for various medical (anti epileptic agents, steroids, nightly benzodiazepenes etc.) and surgical (multiple subpial transactions) options. Each speaker will also formulate an important research question for the future that will improve our understanding of these conditions for devising better treatment methods. Live interaction with the diverse group of audience will also provide a forum to discuss where and how we should move forward with a collaborative effort for advancing our knowledge and treatment of these conditions.

Different brain rhythms, consisting of both low and fast frequencies, are grouped within complex wave-sequences. These rhythms serve as powerful synchronizing forces and play important roles in all aspects of higher cortical function. During this symposium a review of the normal inherent network properties of brain excitatory and inhibitory circuits will be reviewed along with the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for these rhythms. The relationship between intrinsic hippocampal rhythms and learning and memory will be discussed. Aberrant rhythms may contribute to pathological processes such as memory impairment. There is also increasing evidence that high frequency oscillations may precede epilepsy in both the immature and mature brain, having an important role in epileptogenesis. Dr. Jerome Engle will review the physiological basis of brain rhythms and the role of high frequency oscillations in temporal lobe epilepsy. Dr.Yehezkel Ben-Ari will discuss the role of high frequency stimulations in the mirror focus in immature animals. Dr. Robert Muller will provide information about the relationship between single cell firing patterns, hippocampal rhythms, and learning. Dr. John Huguenard will discuss oscillations in the thalamocortical system and the mechanisms of epileptic synchrony. This session will emphasize that epilepsy and its related morbidities are caused by neuronal network abnormalities. The brain's rhythms are critical in determining whether these networks perform normally or abnormally.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? Peyronie's disease (PD) refers to a penile deformity that is associated with sexual dysfunction. Aim.? To provide recommendations and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) based on best evidence for diagnosis and treatment of PD. Methods.? Medical literature was reviewed and combined with expert opinion of the authors. Main Outcome Measures.? Recommendations and SOPs based on grading of evidence?based medical literature. Results.? PD is a fibrotic wound-healing disorder involving the tunica albuginea of the corpora cavernosa. The resulting scar is responsible for a variety of deformities, including curvature, shortening, narrowing with hinge effect, and is frequently associated in the early phase with pain. Patients frequently experience diminished quality erections. All of these conditions can compromise sexual function for the affected male. The etiopathophysiology of PD has yet to be clarified and as a result, effective, reliable, mechanistic directed non-surgical therapy is lacking. Conclusions.? The management of PD consists of proper diagnosis and treatment, ranging from non-surgical to surgical interventions. The main state of treatment for PD rests at this time on surgical correction that should be based on clear indications, involve surgical consent, and follow a surgical algorithm that includes tunica plication, plaque incision/partial excision and grafting, and penile prosthesis implantation.
