AB  - Purpose of the study:? To identify strengths and weaknesses in current studies with a view to carrying out a major multi-center study in Australia. Methods:? The literature was reviewed using standard Medline and Ovid methods. Bibliography of well known key recent papers were used to identify further papers. Results:? Studies evaluating persistent pain after breast cancer surgery have been small and few were prospective controlled studies with adequate power. Like Jung et?al[1] we found that the literature was inconsistent in defining chronic pain and differentiating the breast cancer surgery pain syndromes. Marked variations in prior studies are due to differences in: study size (n?=?22 to 282 patients), methodology, diagnostic criteria, pain assessment instruments, and distribution of demographic and clinical characteristics in the samples studied. Unfortunately the largest study to date, the ALMANAC Trial (n?=?1031) which compared sentinel node biopsy vs ?standard axillary dissection? evaluated arm and shoulder function and quality of life, but not pain[2]. From the current literature, it appears that neuropathic breast and arm pain are most common. Widely varying prevalence estimates of different neuropathic pain syndromes have been reported: phantom breast pain (3?44%); intercostobrachial neuralgia (ICBN) (16?39%); ICBN in breast conserving surgery (14?61%); and ?neuroma pain? (23?49%). The most established risk factors for surgically related neuropathic pain syndromes are intraoperative nerve trauma, severe acute postoperative pain, and high use of postoperative analgesics[1]. Psychosocial distress is reported to be a risk factor and a consequence of chronic pain[1]. Conclusions:? Well-designed large multi-center studies are required to identify prevalences of various pain types, associated risk factors and treatment success for pain after breast cancer surgery. Such a study is in progress through the collaboration of our group with the Sentinel Node vs Axillary Clearance (SNAC) Study of 1000 women following breast surgery, conducted by the Royal Australian College of Surgeons (RACS).

AB  - Though first introduced more than 130 years ago, the concept of stress diabetes or stress hyperglycemia has gained tremendous attention in recent years in view of the landmark article by van den Berghe and colleagues in 2001. As opposed to earlier work that suggested that hyperglycemia in the acute clinical setting may be beneficial, it now appears that lower glucose levels are associated with improved outcomes. The mechanisms behind the improved outcomes are numerous and seem to be tied to the inflammatory process. Both lower glucose values and insulin therapy seem to be anti-inflammatory, whereas hyperglycemia increases the proinflammatory process and negatively affects the innate immune system. Despite the numerous approaches to achieve normoglycemia described in the literature, only modest success has been achieved. Understanding the pathophysiology driving stress hyperglycemia?the stress response and modulation of the inflammatory process?seems to be the key to improving the care of the most critically ill and injured patients.

AB  - Abstract An increasing number of suicide attempts involve the ingestion of glyphosate surfactant; hence, clinical toxicologists may encounter severe cases of glyphosate surfactant intoxication. In several other clinical conditions, serum lactate is used to predict outcome. We investigated the relationship between lactate levels and 30-day mortality from glyphosate surfactant poisoning. This retrospective analysis involved 232 patients who were admitted to the emergency department after acute glyphosate surfactant poisoning between January 2004 and June 2014. We used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to define the optimal cut-off point for lactate levels. A Kaplan?Meier 30-day survival curve was then analysed in terms of the defined cut-off level. We used multi-variate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to determine the risk factors for 30-day mortality. Of the 232 patients, 29 died, yielding a case fatality rate of 12.5%. Lactate was significantly higher in non-survivors (6.5 ± 3.1 mmol/L) than in survivors (3.3 ± 2.2 mmol/L; p < 0.001), and elevated lactate was significantly associated with 30-day mortality. The area under the ROC curve of lactate levels was 0.836 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.716?0.869]. Lactate levels higher than 4.7 mmol/L were associated with increased mortality in multi-variable analysis (hazard ratio: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.1?8.7). Besides lactate, age >59 years, corrected QT interval >495 ms and potassium >5.5 mmol/L were independent risk factors for 30-day mortality. Lactate is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality in patients with glyphosate surfactant poisoning. Early measurement of lactate levels may be a simple and practical way to assess the severity of intoxication.

AB  - Abstract Diuretics are agents that increase urine output or flow. The effects of diuretic agents on electrolyte and water excretion in the kidney for the treatment of edema, congestive heart failure, ascites, and hypertension are reviewed. The structure and function of the kidney in the formation of urine are presented using the functional unit of the kidney, the nephron. The various sites where absorption, secretion, and the passive and active transport of water and electrolytes alter the composition of the glomerular filtrate from Bowman's capsule as it passes through the lumen of the nephron to the collecting ducts on its way to becoming urine are described. Diuretics are classified as low ceiling, high ceiling (loop), and potassium-sparing diuretics, natriuretic peptides, atrial natriuretic peptides, atrial natriuretic peptide potentiators, osmotic diuretics, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, methylxanthines, organomercurials, and aquaretics. The pharmacology, mechanisms or site of action in the nephron, and clinical effectiveness are discussed. Included is a discussion of the risk factors and side effects of diuretic agents.

AB  - Background and Objectives? Transfusion of autologous whole blood is one available method to reduce the need for allogenic blood transfusion. The objective of this study was to investigate the safety of transfusion of intra-operative autologous whole blood by monitoring plasma concentration of laboratory variables and adverse events after transfusion with the Sangvia? system. Materials and Methods? The clinical trial was designed as an open, prospective, multi-centre study, and a total of 20 patients undergoing primary hip arthroplasty were included. Systemic blood samples were taken and analysed preoperatively, at transfusion start and end and at 3, 6, 24 and 48?h after the transfusion. Results? Elevated values of complement activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines were seen in the intra-operatively collected blood but the impact on systemic levels were limited with low peak levels, systemic elevations before transfusion and normalization during the study period. Elevated levels of free haemoglobin and potassium were also detected in the intra-operatively collected blood, but systemic values were within reference values after the transfusion. No clinically relevant adverse event occurred during the study. Conclusion? Inflammatory mediators and plasma haemoglobin were increased in intra-operatively salvaged and filtered blood compared to circulatory levels. Intra-operative retransfusion of autologous whole blood caused a transient systemic increase that normalized in the early postoperative period. There were no significant adverse events reported in the study. These data suggest that the Sangvia? system can be used for intra-operative collection and retransfusion of salvaged blood.

AB  - Abstract In addition to the genomic alterations that occur in malignant cells, the immune system is increasingly appreciated as a critical axis that regulates the rise of neoplasms and the development of primary tumours and metastases. The interaction between inflammatory cell infiltrates and stromal cells in the tumour microenvironment is complex, with inflammation playing both pro- and anti-tumorigenic roles. Inflammasomes are intracellular multi-protein complexes that act as key signalling hubs of the innate immune system. They respond to cellular stress and trauma by promoting activation of caspase-1, a protease that induces a pro-inflammatory cell death mode termed pyroptosis along with the maturation and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1? and IL-18. Here, we will briefly introduce inflammasome biology with a focus on the dual roles of inflammasome-produced cytokines in cancer development. Despite emerging insight that inflammasomes may promote and suppress cancer development according to the tumour stage and the tumour microenvironment, much remains to be uncovered. Further exploration of inflammasome biology in tumorigenesis should enable the development of novel immunotherapies for cancer patients.

PY  - 2014
AB  - Abstract Intensive or extensive culture of aquatic animals requires chemicals that control disease, enhance the growth of cultured species, reduce handling trauma to organisms, improve water quality, disinfect water, and control aquatic vegetation, predaceous insects, or other nuisance organisms. The aquaculture chemical needs for various species have been described for rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss; Atlantic and Pacific salmon, Salmo salar and Oncorhynchus sp.; channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus; striped bass, Morone saxatilis; milkfish, Chanos chanos; mollusks; penaeid shrimp; and a variety of other freshwater and marine species. Laws and regulations on the use of chemicals in aquaculture vary by country. Regulations and therapeutants or other chemicals that are approved or allowed for use in the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan, Chile, and Australia are presented herein. In the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulate the application of chemicals to organisms or to their environments. FDA controls the use of drugs and anesthetics, and EPA controls the application of chemicals and pesticides to the environment. Each agency develops appropriate guidelines and policies to implement the laws for its field of responsibility. Few therapeutants are registered in the United States for use on any cultured aquatic species. In the most critical area of antibacterials, only two (Terramycin for Fish and Romet-30) are approved and available. Formalin (Formalin-F, Parasite-S, Paracide-F) is the only registered fungicide and Paracide-F is the only formalin product currently labeled for use on eggs of all fish at 1000?2000 mg/L for 15 min. Formalin (Formalin-F, Parasite-S, Paracide-F) is the only parasiticide currently approved and available. Paracide-F is the only formalin product currently approved for use on all fish. Povidone-iodine compounds can be used to disinfect the surface of fish eggs because FDA has classified them as low regulatory priority substances. Water treatment compounds (potassium permanganate, calcium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium carbonate, calcium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, tris buffer, and sodium sulfite), anesthetics (tricaine, carbon dioxide gas, and sodium bicarbonate), herbicides (copper sulfate, chelated copper compounds, and diquat dibromide) and piscicides (antimycin and rotenone) are also registered and regulated. The control of aquaculture drugs varies according to country from no regulation to restrictive regulations. Generally, few requirements are needed for a therapeutant to be licensed or registered in Africa, and most of Asia and South America. Except for environmental studies, requirements for registration data in Canada are similar to requirements in the United States. However, Canada has significantly different regulations and approval processes. Canadian aquaculturalists use drugs that are either licensed for other food animals and prescribed by veterinarians or used in an emergency under the direction of the Canadian Bureau of Veterinary Drugs (BVD). Chemicals authorized for use in aquaculture in Canada include oxytetracycline, sulfadimethoxine and ormetoprim (Romet-30, Romet-B), and others. Chemicals authorized for use in aquaculture in certain European countries include ampicillin, chlortetracycline, and others. In Japan, registration of drugs for aquatic species requires the same data as those required for drugs on other animals. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forests, and Fisheries and the Ministry of Welfare control the use of chemicals and aquaculture in Japan. As of April 2001, more chemicals were registered for aquacultural use in Japan than in any other country. They include amoxicillin, ampicillin, florfenicol, tetracycline, thiamphenicol, eugenol, and hydrogen peroxide. More therapeutants and vaccines may soon be added to the medicine chest of fish farmers. Research has been conducted on important antibacterial compounds in the United States and the U.S. Geological Survey's Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center is working on several fronts to improve the availability of anesthetics, fungicides and parasiticides.

AB  - Abstract Lanthanides, once termed rare-earth elements, are not as sparce in the environment as their traditional name suggests. Mean litospheric concentrations are in fact comparable to the physiologically fundamental elements such as iodine, cobalt, and selenium. Recent advances in medical technology have resulted in accumulation of lanthanides presenting potential exposure to both our central and peripheral nervous systems. Extensive and detailed studies on these peculiar active metals in the context of their influence on neural functions are therefore urgently required. Almost all neurochemical effects of trivalent lanthanide ions appear to result from the similarity of their radii to the key signaling ion calcium. Lanthanides, especially La3+ and Gd3+ block different types of calcium, potassium, and sodium channels in human and animal neurons, regulate neurotransmitter turnover and release, as well as synaptic activity. Lanthanides also act as modulators of several ionotropic receptors, e.g., GABA, NMDA, and kainate and can also affect numerous signaling mechanisms including NF-?B and apoptotic-related endoplasmic reticulum IRE1-XBP1, PERK, and ATF6 pathways. Several lanthanide ions may cause oxidative neuronal injuries and functional impairment by promoting reactive oxygen species production. However, cerium and yttrium oxides have some unique and promising neuroprotective properties, being able to decrease free radical cell injury and even alleviate motor impairment and cognitive function in animal models of multiple sclerosis and mild traumatic brain damage, respectively. In conclusion, lanthanides affect various neurophysiological processes, altering a large spectrum of brain functions. Thus, a deeper understanding of their potential mechanistic roles during disease and as therapeutic agents requires urgent elucidation.

This article reports a myeloproliferative disorder in a dog that was ultimately designated as MbL on the basis of the presence of circulating blast cells and thrombocythaemia, and of multi-organ infiltration and myelofibrosis. It comments on the difficulties of diagnosing such a condition and reviews previously published articles on MbL and ET in dogs and cats.

AB  - . The Japanese Red Cross analysed the results of questionnaires sent in 1993 regarding post-transfusion graft-vs.-host disease (PT-GVHD) from hospitals; the majority of patients with PT-GVHD in 1993 were transfused for cardiovascular or cancer surgery, and about 10 patients had died yearly from PT-GVHD in the following few years. The Japan Society of Blood Transfusion (JSBT) organized a subcommittee for the prevention of PT-GVHD, and issued a fourth version of guidelines for the irradiation of blood to prevent PT-GVHD. These guidelines recommended transfusion of irradiated blood for cardiosurgery, cancer surgery, elderly recipients and severe trauma, as well as congenital immunodeficient recipients, newborn infants and other immunocompromised patients. Also recommended was irradiation not only of blood within 72?h after collection but also of blood stored for 14?days. Reported PT-GVHD has diminished to a few cases in recent years.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective: To determine whether alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) in near-lethal hyperkalemia either lowers potassium (K) rapidly or shortens duration of cardiac conduction disturbances. Methods: A controlled canine laboratory investigation of 3 treatments for severe hyperkalemia. Conditioned dogs (n = 8; 17?30 kg) received, in random order, 2 mmol/kg of each of 3 treatments (matched in sodium and water) in separate experiments ≥1 week apart: 1.05% NaHCO3 over 60 minutes (infusion therapy); 8.4% NaHCO3 over 5 minutes, then 14 mL/kg sterile water over 55 minutes (bolus therapy); 8.4% NaCl over 5 minutes, then 14 mL/kg sterile water over 55 minutes (saline therapy). Prior to administering one of the above therapies, the animals were anesthetized with 0.5?2.5% isoflurane and ventilated to maintain a normal Pco2. After 30 minutes of equilibration, 2 mmol/kg/hr (loading dose) of a 2-mmol/mL KCl solution was given until idioventricular or relative junctional bradycardic dysrhythmias were sustained for 15 minutes. Then KCl was decreased to 1 mmol/kg/hr (maintenance dose) for 2 hours and 45 minutes. Treatment was begun after 45 minutes of maintenance KCl infusion. Results: The pretreatment K level (all studies) was 9.06 ± 0.82 mmol/L (mean ± SD). Although the mean K level decreased more after saline therapy than after bolus therapy at every time, differences were neither statistically significant nor clinically important during the first 30 minutes. The means of the differences in decreases (saline minus bolus) were small, 0.26 (95% CI, -0.48 to 1.00) at 15 minutes, 0.16 (95% CI, -0.67 to 0.98) at 30 minutes. Dysrhythmia duration was shorter with bolus therapy than for saline therapy in only 1 of 5 dogs (p = 0.38). Conclusions: Hypertonic saline bolus lowered plasma K as effectively as NaHCO3 bolus in this animal model within the first 30 minutes. Clinically meaningful decreases due to alkalinization alone within 30 minutes are unlikely.

AB  - Background: Repeated hypoxia and surgical trauma trigger a potent neuroendocrine response and their association is thought to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of multi-organ dysfunction. We investigated the cardiovascular and metabolic responses to repeated acute hypoxia in anaesthetised and surgically instrumented pigs. Methods: Under ketamine-midazolam anaesthesia, 15 pigs were surgically instrumented for measurements of cardiac output, vascular pressures and organ blood flows. Lactate production and O2 uptake were determined in the brain, liver, kidney and intestine. Ten animals were subjected to two 12-min periods of ventilatory hypoxia (FIO2=7%) followed by re-oxygenation and 5 animals underwent 120?min normoxic ventilation (Control group). Results: Both hypoxic challenges produced a comparable release of catecholamines that was associated with increased cardiac output and redistribution of blood flow away from the intestinal and renal areas towards the brain and the liver; O2 uptake was markedly reduced in the intestine (? 56 ± 10%, P < 0.05) and least affected in the brain and the kidney (? 19±12% and ? 23±21%, respectively). During the second hypoxic test, lethal cardiovascular depression occurred in 5 animals; these non-survivors demonstrated impaired hyperdynamic response and incomplete recovery of intestinal O2 uptake during the first hypoxia/reoxygenation test. In the Control group, normoxic ventilation was not associated with significant haemodynamic and metabolic changes. Conclusion: Intraoperative hypoxia causes marked heterogeneity in organ blood flow and metabolism. The inability to develop a hyperdynamic cardiovascular response during a first hypoxic event, as well as a persistent intestinal O2 debt following re-oxygenation, predict the occurrence of death during the second hypoxic insult.

Abnormal laboratory findings included anaemia (63%), thrombocytopenia (63%), leucocytosis (57%), increase of plasma urea (84%) and creatinine concentrations (81%), increased liver enzyme activities (80%), hyperbilirubinaemia (69%), hyperphosphataemia (67%), hyponatraemia (64%), hypoalbuminaemia (55%) and hypokalaemia (29%). Radiological pulmonary changes were detected in 57% of the dogs initially or during the course of disease. Severe dyspnoea, oliguria, azotaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia and severe radiological pulmonary changes were more often found in dogs that did not survive. There was renal, hepatic and pulmonary involvement in 95, 92 and 58% of the dogs, respectively, and multi-organ lesions in 98 dogs (98%); 32 dogs died or were euthanased. Conclusion Several clinical and laboratory abnormalities were associated with a negative outcome; severe lung involvement was specifically associated with high mortality.

AB  - Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics, management and long-term outcome in dogs with suspected rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. Method: Medical records and video recordings of 14 dogs with suspected rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder were reviewed and the owners were contacted via telephone or email for further information. Results: Clinical signs included episodes of violent limb movements, howling, barking, growling, chewing, or biting during sleep. Episodes occurred at night and during daytime naps. The age at onset ranged from 8 weeks to 7·5 years with a median of 6 years but 64% of dogs were one year or less. There was no apparent sex or breed predisposition. Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder events were reduced in severity and frequency in 78% of the dogs treated with 40 mg/kg/day oral potassium bromide. One dog was euthanised within 3 months of the onset of signs because of their severity. The duration of the disorder in the 13 surviving dogs ranged from 1·5 to 9 years. None of the dogs spontaneously recovered. Clinical Significance: Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder is suspected to occur in dogs, as it does in human beings. It causes concern to the owners and disrupts the home environment. Unlike human beings, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder of dogs often has a juvenile onset.

AB  - Abstract Colloids have been used for many years in resuscitation yet few studies have thoroughly examined their usefulness. Colloids and a combination of crystalloids and colloids continue to be used without any real scientific basis. Scrutiny of review articles, experimental studies, and clinical investigations reveals conflicting and confusing data. There are too many variables to accurately interpret findings, cross species problems with animal studies, different fluids used making comparisons difficult if not impossible, and confounding variables that include: 1 Health status of the patients 2 Severity/type of injury 3 Complications (especially sepsis) 4 Varying grades of shock 5 Variable time scale of administration of fluids 6 Variable volumes administered 7 Differing methods of determining fluid volume depletion 8 Inconsistent monitoring 9 Differing endpoints 10 Different techniques to measure endpoints 11 Comparison of delayed treatment of traumatic shock with blood loss occurring during surgery of questionable validity. One of the areas that has been studied reasonably well is the allergic effects associated with colloid use and more recently the adverse effects associated with the use of dextrose solutions in patients with head injuries. The continued effort to develop satisfactory resuscitation solutions including the recent development of hypertonic saline solutions (usually in combination with a colloid) highlights the uncertainty that exists in relation to the true role of the colloid and crystalloid agents available. Recent studies question the use of fluids to resuscitate patients with penetrating torso injuries. The aim of this paper is to review what is known about the use of colloids and crystalloids in resuscitation and to recommend guidelines as to which fluid should be used in differing clinical situations.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the incidence of postattenuation seizures (PAS) in dogs that underwent single congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt (cEHPSS) attenuation and to compare incidence of PAS in dogs that either did or did not receive prophylactic treatment with levetiracetam (LEV). Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study. Population Nine hundred forty dogs. Methods Medical records were reviewed to identify dogs that underwent surgical attenuation of a single cEHPSS from January 2005 through July 2017 and developed PAS within 7 days postoperatively. Dogs were divided into 3 groups: no LEV (LEV?); LEV at ≥15?mg/kg every 8 hours for ≥24 hours preoperatively or a 60 mg/kg intravenous loading dose perioperatively, followed by ≥15?mg/kg every 8 hours postoperatively (LEV1); and LEV at?<15?mg/kg every 8 hours, for <24 hours preoperatively, or continued at <15?mg/kg every 8 hours postoperatively (LEV2). Results Seventy-five (8.0%) dogs developed PAS. Incidence of PAS was 35 of 523 (6.7%), 21 of 188 (11.2%), and 19 of 228 (8.3%) in groups LEV-, LEV1, and LEV2, respectively. This difference was not statistically significant (P?=?.14). No differences between groups of dogs that seized with respect to investigated variables were identified. Conclusion The overall incidence of PAS was low (8%). Prophylactic treatment with LEV according to the protocols that were investigated in our study was not associated with a reduced incidence of PAS. Clinical significance Prophylactic treatment with LEV does not afford protection against development of PAS. Surgically treated dogs should continue to be monitored closely during the first 7 days postoperatively for seizures.

AB  - 1. N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-activated currents were recorded from dissociated rat retinal ganglion cells using whole-cell recording. The NMDA open-channel blocking drug memantine was evaluated for non-competitive and/or uncompetitive components of antagonism. A rapid superfusion system was used to apply various drugs for kinetic analysis. 2. Dose-response data revealed that memantine blocked 200 microM NMDA-evoked responses with a 50% inhibition constant (IC50) of approximately 1 microM at -60 mV and an empirical Hill coefficient of approximately 1. The antagonism followed a bimolecular reaction process. This 1:1 stoichiometry is supported by the fact that the macroscopic blocking rate of memantine (kon) increased linearly with memantine concentration and the macroscopic unblocking rate (koff) was independent of it. The estimated pseudo-first order rate constant for macroscopic blockade was 4 x 10(5) M-1 S-1 and the rate constant for unblocking was 0.44 s-1. Both the blocking and unblocking actions of memantine were well fitted by a single exponential process. 3. The kon for 2 microM memantine decreased with decreasing concentrations of NMDA. By analysing kon behaviour, we estimate that memantine has minimal interaction with the closed-unliganded state of the channel. As channel open probability (Po) approached zero, a small residual action of memantine may be explained by the presence of endogenous glutamate and glycine. 4. Memantine could be trapped within the NMDA-gated channel if it was suddenly closed by fast washout of agonist. The measured gating process of channel activation and deactivation appeared at least 10-20-fold faster than the kinetics of memantine action. By combining the agonist and voltage dependence of antagonism, a trapping scheme was established for further kinetic analysis. 5. With low agonist concentrations, NMDA-gated channels recovered slowly from memantine blockade. By analysing the probability of a channel remaining blocked, we found that memantine binding appeared to stabilize the open conformation of the blocked channel and did not affect ligand affinity. Validity of the 'trapping model' and stabilization of the open conformation were further suggested by agreement between the predicted dose-response curve for NMDA in the presence of 2 microM memantine and the empirically derived dose-response relationship. 6. Based on simple molecular schemes, the degree of blockade at various concentrations of agonist for 'pure' non-competitive vs. uncompetitive inhibition was computer simulated. The measured degree of blockade by 6 microM memantine was close to ideal for pure uncompetitive antagonism. Taken together, we conclude that the predominant mechanism of open-channel blockade by memantine is uncompetitive. In general, the relative magnitude of the dissociation rate of an open-channel blocker from the open but blocked channel (the apparent off-rate) compared with the rate of leaving the closed and blocker-trapped state (the leak rate) will determine the contribution of uncompetitive vs. non-competitive actions, respectively. 7. Millimolar internal Cs+ competed with memantine for binding in the NMDA-gated channel, and reduced the association rate of memantine, but had no effect on the voltage dependence of the dissociation rate. After removal of Cs+, the calculated Ki for memantine remained voltage dependent. These observations would be difficult to reconcile with models in which memantine binds to a site outside the channel pore and instead strongly support the supposition that the blocking site for memantine is within the permeation pathway.

AB  - Abstract Isolated pig hearts, subsequently perfused with pig or human blood, were prepared for the cytochemical demonstration of sites of hydrogen peroxide generation and increased vascular permeability. Oxidant stress was associated with ultrastructural changes commonly seen following myocardial reperfusion. In addition, the precipitation of cerium perhydroxide following perfusion with physiological saline containing cerium chloride suggested the vascular endothelium and leukocytes as sources of oxidants. This was associated with rapid penetration of horseradish peroxidase through the intercellular clefts of the vascular endothelium into the interstitial space, suggesting increased vascular leakiness at these sites. The rapid penetration of horseradish peroxidase was observed at all monitored periods of reperfusion with pig or human blood. This indicates that the increased permeability occurred during the ischaemic period and continued during reperfusion. Morphological damage was greatest in pig hearts reperfused with whole human blood and this was attenuated if the blood was preabsorbed to remove antibodies prior to reperfusion. We conclude that oxidant stress was initiated during ischaemia and continued during reperfusion in this model. Microsc. Res. Tech. 42:369?385, 1998. ? 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? There is strong evidence obtained from controlled trials that supports the use of biopsychosocial multidisciplinary interventions for chronic pain. Yet, studies of the clinical effectiveness and routine application of these approaches in real world settings are rare. This clinical evaluation sought to prospectively track changes in physical (e.g., pain severity, pain-related disability) and psychological (e.g., pain anxiety, pain self-efficacy) outcomes following usual care intervention at a large pain medicine centre (PMC). The degree to which improvements in physical and psychological outcomes were related to patient satisfaction was also examined. Methods:? One hundred and nine (M age?=?56.32 years, 51.4% female, pain chronicity Mdn?=?5 years) of 141 invited patients who attended the PMC for the first time over a 4-month period completed a pretreatment questionnaire comprised of standardised measures of pain, psychological function, and social background. Forty-three and 46 patients completed the 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments respectively, which also included measures of patient satisfaction. Results:? Wiithin the initial 3 months of treatment there were no significant declines in reported pain intensity, yet patients reported significant improvements in pain relief (p?<?0.05). Patients who completed the 3-month follow-up questionnaire reported significantly reduced levels of disability (p?<?0.05), less frequent episodes of fearful appraisal and pain avoidance (p?<?0.05), and a reduction in catastrophizing pain coping responses (p?<?0.02). At 6 months, patients did not report any further improvements in physical and psychological function beyond what they had achieved within the first 3 months. Preliminary findings suggest that patient satisfaction with treatment is significantly related to perceived reductions in disability (p?<?0.05) and improvements in self-efficacy for coping with pain (p?<?0.01), yet not significantly related to changes in pain coping style. Conclusions:? These findings highlight the importance of measuring treatment outcomes prospectively across different time points in view of the initial improvement in outcome and subsequent plateau observed here. Furthermore, these preliminary results suggest the centrality of patient beliefs pertaining to disability and confidence in their ability to cope when examining the effectiveness of pain interventions.
