AB  - Summary Adverse events (AEs) in medical malpractice, due to their frequency and socioeconomic costs, have gained public and political attention. In the USA, UK and Australia, several studies have been conducted concerning AEs, preventable AEs (PAEs) and negligent AEs (NAEs), but mostly only in hospitalised patients as ambulant medical care data are hardly available. The data of the arbitration committees of the medical councils are well documented and evaluated either locally by the responsible medical chamber or nationwide by the German medical chamber. Lethal cases are a special subgroup and the best available data source is the files of the Institutes of Forensic Medicine. An autopsy is a very efficient method for clarifying medical malpractice claims. Therapeutic misadventure can be classified in many ways. Two examples are given in this chapter. The modern forensic investigation into medical treatment related death uses the knowledge of the clinical liaison service (CLS).

AB  - Background It is not clear whether patients entering a specialized, interdisciplinary weaning unit from surgical or medical intensive care units (ICU) distinguish substantially. The purpose of the present study was to assess differences in patients with prolonged weaning being referred from surgical and medical ICU. Methods Data collected from April 2013 to April 2014 was conducted for retrospective analysis. Mortality rates, demographic data, clinical, and microbial differences in 150 patients with prolonged weaning were assessed (80 surgical and 70 medical). Results Surgical ICU referrals tended to be older (70.7 ± 11.3 vs. 67.3 ± 12.3, P = 0.051) and had fewer underlying pulmonary diseases (45% vs. 60%, P = 0.067). Sodium values at the time of referral to the weaning unit were significantly higher in surgical (147.1 ± 9.6) vs. medical (141.3 ± 6.7 mmol/l) patients (P < 0.001). Each 10-unit increase in sodium at the time of referral to the weaning unit was associated with a 2.5-day (95% CI ?0.4, 5.4; P = 0.09) prolongation of stay in the weaning unit. Although significant differences in microbiological agents from tracheal aspiration were seen, the infection rate on the weaning unit was similar in both groups. There was no difference in weaning unit mortality between surgical and medical ICU patients (18% vs. 23%; P = 0.41). Conclusion Few differences were found between patients being referred to a specialized weaning unit from surgical vs. medical ICUs. Besides differences in microbiological characteristics of tracheal secretions, there were also differences in sodium levels, which appear to influence on treatment duration.

AB  - Abstract Background: Most hospitals have a Cardiac Arrest Team, activated after cardiopulmonary arrest. The Medical Emergency Team (MET) is a newer concept, encompassing a proactive response to a wide range of emergencies with the aim of preventing irreversible organ failure and cardiopulmonary arrest. Aim: To describe the application of the MET model to the district general hospital, the spectrum of clinical conditions encountered, outcomes and administrative problems. Method: Data regarding each MET activation was collected prospectively. Results: The MET responded to 68 calls to 63 patients in 12 months. The mean age was 60.4 years (range: neonatal to 94 years). The most common conditions leading to MET activation were chest pain (19.1%), cardiopulmonary arrest (14.7%), seizures (14.7%) and respiratory distress (13.2%). Conclusion: This paper demonstrates that the application of the MET model to the district general hospital improves the process of patient care. We are unable to conclude whether the MET alters morbidity or mortality for hospital inpatients.

AB  - Abstract Sucralfate is a site-protective ulcer healing drug with a remarkable range of mechanisms of action. Recent studies highlight the capacity of sucralfate to bind basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and deliver it in high concentration to the ulcer. Basic fibroblast growth factor stimulates the production of granulation tissue, angiogenesis and re-epithelization, thus improving the quality of ulcer healing. The effect of sucralfate in reducing parietal cell sensitivity may be another factor important in the lower relapse rate demonstrated after duodenal ulcer healing. Sucralfate has been demonstrated to be efficacious in healing both duodenal and gastric ulcers together with mild oesophagitis, and it is safe for both short-term use and maintenance. In stress ulcer prophylaxis it is as effective as acid suppression or neutralization and has the advantage of lesser rates of nosocomial pneumonia than are demonstrated with antacids or H2 antagonists. The potential advantages of sucralfate lie in the better quality of ulcer healing associated with longer duration of remission.
