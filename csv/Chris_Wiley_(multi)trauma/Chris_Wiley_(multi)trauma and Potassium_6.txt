AB  - Abstract The ingestion of corrosive substances may produce severe burns to the upper aerodigestive tract and stomach, particularly if the pH is greater than 12 or less than two. There is a biphasic age grouping with adult cases most often involving self-harm and pediatric cases accidental ingestion. Three cases are reported to demonstrate characteristic features following the ingestion of potassium hydroxide, glacial acetic acid and Lysol?, respectively. All deaths were due to the effects of caustic burns to the upper aerodigestive tract, esophagus and stomach with perforation and/or hemorrhage. The extent of injuries in these cases depends on the nature, amount, and concentration of the agent and on the exposure time. A point to note at autopsy is that tissue damage may also occur from postmortem exposure. Typical injuries involve perioral, limb, and trunk burns, with extensive aerodigestive liquefactive/coagulative necrosis causing hemorrhage and perforation.

AB  - Summary Two or three different solutions may be used to preserve thoracic and abdominal organs during a single procurement. The aim of this prospective, multi-center, noncomparative study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Celsior? (study solution, solution S) as a flushing and cold storage solution for both thoracic and abdominal organs. Between August 1999 and July 2000, 72 consecutive multiple-organ procurements were performed using solution S as the sole solution for flushing out and cold-storing thoracic and abdominal grafts. Two hundred and sixty-four grafts were implanted into 245 recipients (131 kidneys, 9 kidney?pancreases, 69 livers, 34 hearts and 6 heart?lungs). The mean cold ischemia time was 21?h for kidneys (26%>24?h); 11?h 26?min for pancreases, 9?h 16?min for livers (23%>12?h), and 2?h 58?min for hearts and lungs. No cardiac failure or arrhythmia occurred on graft reperfusion. Fourteen percent of kidney recipients had delayed graft function. The mean serum creatinin level at 3 months was 123?±?41??mol/l. All pancreas recipients were insulin-free at 3?months. Primary graft nonfunction occurred in one liver recipient. Complete hepatic artery thrombosis occurred in six liver recipients during the first month; four of these patients had a risk factor for thrombosis. All but three of the heart recipients were in sinus rhythm on day 1, and 65% were extubated on day 1. Inotropic drugs were necessary during the first 72?h in 25% of heart recipients. Twelve-month patient and graft survival rates were, respectively, 100% and 96% (kidney), 100% and 89% (pancreas), 88% and 83% (liver), 77.5% (heart) and 67% (heart?lung). These results suggest that Celsior?, a ready-to-use solution, is safe and effective for multiple organ procurement and preservation.

AB  - Summary Four horses (H, J, N and M) undertook a simulated competition exercise test (CET), designed to simulate physiological and metabolic stresses of the Speed and Endurance (S  30°C/40%RH (hot, dry [HD]) and 30°C/80%RH (hot, humid [HH]) (Marlin et al. 1995a). Venous blood samples for electrolyte and total protein (TP) determinations were collected from indwelling catheters at predetermined time points throughout each CET and initial 30 min recovery period. Venous blood samples were collected by jugular venepuncture at 2 h and 24 h after the end of the final 8 min canter (Phase D). The effects of exercise, environmental condition and horse on venous TP, sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl?), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+) and phosphate (PP43-) plasma concentrations were investigated. In addition, the effect of environmental condition on estimated cation loss was evaluated. All horses completed the full CET under the CD and HD conditions, but only one horse completed the full 8 min of the final canter Phase D under HH conditions. Exercise had a significant (P<0.05) effect on all parameters similar to those reported previously in field competitions. There was a significant (P<0.05) interaction between time and horse for TP, Na+ and Cl?. Overall, the environmental condition had a significant (P<0.05) effect on all parameters, but the differences were not considered to be of any physiological relevance, other than for Cl? and TP. There was a significant (P<0.05) interaction between time and environmental condition for Cl? and TP only. During much of the CET and recovery period, mean Cl? values were higher with the first CD session than the second CD session or under the HH or HD conditions. For TP after 2 min of Phase D and during the initial recovery period, concentrations were higher under the HH conditions and returned to the Pre- values less quickly. There were marked individual variations in the estimated cation losses and no consistent effect of environmental condition was found. Although estimated fluid loss was similar following both HD and HH sessions, restoration of bodyweight was slower following the CET studies under HH conditions.

AB  - Abstract In cartilage regeneration, the biomimetic functionalization of hydrogels with growth factors is a promising approach to improve the in vivo performance and furthermore the clinical potential of these materials. In order to achieve this without compromising network properties, multifunctional linear poly(glycidol) acrylate (PG-Acr) is synthesized and utilized as crosslinker for hydrogel formation with thiol-functionalized hyaluronic acid via Michael-type addition. As proof-of-principle for a bioactivation, transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-?1) is covalently bound to PG-Acr via Traut's reagent which does not compromise the hydrogel gelation and swelling behavior. Human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) embedded within these bioactive hydrogels show a distinct dose-dependent chondrogenesis. Covalent incorporation of TGF-?1 significantly enhances the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs compared to hydrogels with supplemented noncovalently bound TGF-?1. The observed chondrogenic response is similar to standard cell culture with TGF-?1 addition with each medium change. In general, multifunctional PG-Acr offers the opportunity to introduce a range of biomimetic modifications (peptides, growth factors) into hydrogels and, thus, appears as an attractive potential material for various applications in regenerative medicine.

AB  - 1 Tallie Z. Baram, 1 Kristen L. Brunson, 1 Celine Dube, 1 Sarit Avishai-Eliner, and 1 Kristina A. Fenoglio ( 1 Pediatrics, Anatomy/ Neurobiology, UCI, Irvine, CA ) Seizures often arise in the setting of an acute injury or insult. In addition, many of the epilepsies are ?symptomatic?, i.e., they occur in individuals who had sustained injury or insult such as infection, trauma, or stroke. The mechanisms by which diverse factors such as infection or trauma provoke both acute seizures and recurrent, chronic seizures (epilepsy) are not fully understood. To some extent, each of these insults may initiate a unique chain of events that promotes epilepsy. However, these insults also share commonalities that set in motion cellular and molecular changes that promote neuronal hyperexcitability: All these epilepsy- provoking insults are stressful, in that they trigger the release and actions of ?stress-mediating molecules?, including glucocorticoids and the intrinsic central nervous system (CNS) stress-activated neuro-peptide, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). Stress induces release of CRH from hippocampal interneurons, and CRH acts on selective receptors (CRF-R1) to enhance glutamate-mediated neurotransmission. In immature hippocampus, CRH and the CRH receptors are particularly abundant, so that the peptide may excite neurons sufficiently to evoke seizures, followed by dendritic atrophy or death of vulnerable neurons. In animal models, chronic enhancement of CRH levels within the developing hippocampus, may result in enduring reduction of hippocampus- governed learning and memory function. Such levels might be found in infants with chronic CNS stressors including congenital infection, dysplasia, trauma or recurrent seizures. Indeed, drugs that downregulate CRH levels in limbic structures (e.g., ACTH) are potent antiepileptics in the developing CNS. In summary, acute and chronic stress elicits the release of pro-excitatory molecules (CRH), promoting seizures. These further activate the ?stress response?, leading to a vicious cycle culminating in loss of neuronal function and integrity.

AB  - Summary Falls are common and important. This chapter assists clinicians seeing older patients presenting with falls in emergency departments, medical units, in the community, nursing homes, and on the wards in the middle of the night. Reduced mobility is a geriatric giant; and-de-conditioning is catastrophic for the frail older person who was previously managing at home in that it can lead to new institutionalisation. Key elements of this chapter include: The difference between a fall and syncope Practical advice for the on-call doctor on how to assess an inpatient who has fallen including red flags such as head injury and anticoagulation, and how to perform and document a primary and secondary survey. Grading of pressure ulcers and practical advice on their emergency management prior to review by a specialist team Information highlighting how deconditioning occurs and the consequences on length of stay and future independence Evidence on the benefit of physiotherapy and occupational therapy in preventing deconditioning. Management of patients with Parkinson's disease and neuromuscular diseases attending emergency departments and acute medical units.

AB  - Abstract Eight anatomical preparations from the collection of Giovan Battista Rini (1795-1856) at the Desenzano Hospital Pathology Division (Brescia, Italy) were examined by computed tomography (CT). The aim of the study was to obtain detailed information on the state of preservation of these ?anatomical mummies? and the techniques used to prepare them. Relying on the existing literature, the examined specimens (five heads with necks, two busts and one heart) could be divided into three types of anatomical specimens: ?dry preparations,? ?corrosion preparations,? and ?organ preparations.? CT examination enabled the assessment of the exact features of each specimen, some of the preparation techniques applied, the presence of foreign bodies, and the use of substances to fill the blood vessels. All of the cases demonstrated an extremely good state of preservation. The study sheds new light on important-yet scarcely known-preparation techniques created for different anatomical demonstrations. Results of the CT investigation were consistent with the anatomical preservation methods described in 18th to 20th century literature, particularly those of Italy. Clin.

AB  - Background Hyperkalemic cardiac arrest is a potential complication of massive transfusion in children. Our objective was to identify risk factors and potential preventive measures by reviewing the literature on transfusion-associated hyperkalemic cardiac arrest (TAHCA) in the pediatric population. Study Design and Methods Literature searches were performed in MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Results We identified nine case reports of pediatric patients who had experienced cardiac arrest during massive transfusion. Serum potassium concentration was reported in eight of those reports; the mean was 9.2?±?1.8?mmol/L. Risk factors for TAHCA noted in the case reports included infancy (n?=?6); age of red blood cells (RBCs; n?=?5); site of transfusion (n?=?5); and the presence of comorbidities such as hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, acidemia, and hypotension (n?=?9). We also identified 13 clinical studies that examined potassium levels associated with transfusion. Of those 13, five studied routine transfusion, two were registries, and six examined massive transfusion. Conclusions Key points identified from this literature search are as follows: 1) Case reports are skewed toward infants and neonates in particular and 2) the rate of blood transfusion, more so than total volume, cardiac output, and the site of infusion, are key factors in the development of TAHCA. Measures to reduce the risk of TAHCA in young children include anticipating and replacing blood loss before significant hemodynamic compromise occurs, using larger-bore (>23-gauge) peripheral intravenous catheters rather than central venous access, checking and correcting electrolyte abnormalities frequently, and using fresher RBCs for massive transfusion.

AB  - Objective To review the clinical features, treatments, complications, and outcomes of horses with traumatic orbital fractures. Study design Retrospective study. Sample Population Eighteen horses with confirmed orbital fractures. Procedures Medical records of horses presenting with orbital fractures between 2006 and 2013 were reviewed. Signalment, etiology of fracture, clinical signs, fracture descriptions, diagnostic imaging, treatments, complications, and outcomes were evaluated. Results Eighteen horses presented with orbital fractures resulting from rearing in a confined space (n = 5), being kicked (4), colliding with a stationary object (3), and unknown trauma (6). Radiography and computed tomography were effective at classifying fractures and evaluating sinus/nasal involvement. Epistaxis/sinusitis were associated with fractures of the zygomatic process of the temporal bone (n = 3) and comminuted fractures of multiple bones (5). Seventeen fractures required treatment, with fifteen receiving a combination of medical and surgical therapy. Surgery included reduction of large bony fragments (n = 8), removal of small fragments (12), stabilization with a wire implant (1), and sinus trephination and lavage (5). Factors contributing to a favorable outcome included: globe retention (n = 16), vision (14), comfort (15), cosmesis (9), and return to previous function (13). Conclusions Horses sustaining orbital fractures treated promptly with medical and surgical therapy have a favorable prognosis for return to function and cosmesis. Fractures affecting the zygomatic process of the frontal bone are unlikely to involve the sinus/nasal cavities. Epistaxis and sinusitis warrant more aggressive therapy and decrease functional and cosmetic outcome.

AB  - Objective To report the diagnosis, treatment, and short-term outcome in dogs with suspected persistent right aortic arch (PRAA) undergoing thoracoscopy with concurrent esophagoscopy. Study Design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Dogs with suspected PRAA (n=9). Methods Medical records were reviewed from 2012 to 2016. Dogs undergoing thoracoscopy for PRAA at 3 referral hospitals were included. Signalment, clinical signs, diagnostic imaging, anesthesia protocol (including the use of one-lung ventilation), surgical approach, complications, and short-term outcome were recorded. Dogs underwent a left-sided intercostal thoracoscopic approach with concurrent intraoperative esophagoscopy. The ligamentum arteriosum (LA) and constricting fibers were divided using a vessel-sealing device using a 3 or 4 port thoracoscopy technique. Visualization and dissection of the LA was aided by transesophageal illumination by esophagoscopy. Results Thoracoscopy confirmed PRAA in 9 dogs, with an aberrant left subclavian artery (LS) identified in 5 dogs. Major complications occurred in 2 dogs: postoperative hemorrhage from the LS and esophageal perforation, which resulted in euthanasia. Median follow-up was 250 days (range, 56?1,595). Regurgitation resolved in 4 of 8 surviving dogs. One dog had recurrence of regurgitation 1,450 days postoperatively, esophageal compression by the LS was identified, and regurgitation resolved following LS transection. Conclusion Esophagoscopy aided identification and dissection of the LA in all cases. Due to the potential for the LS to cause clinical esophageal constriction postoperatively, a recommendation for LS transection may be warranted. Vascular clips can also be considered as an alternative for vessel ligation to avoid complications associated with vessel-sealing device use.

AB  - Abstract Aim:? The assessment of body composition is an important aspect of the determination of nutritional health. This cross-sectional measurement study aimed to assess the relative validity of a range of field techniques for the measurement of body composition in a sample of older orthopaedic inpatients participating in rehabilitation. Methods:? Assessment of percent fat-free mass of 31 adults, aged 65?years and over, was conducted under fasting conditions by two types of bioelectrical impedance analysis (multi-frequency and single frequency?using manufacturer's pre-programmed prediction equation) and compared with percent fat-free mass estimated by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, a reference technique. Data from multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis were also used to calculate percent fat-free mass from the prediction equation of Dey et?al. for comparison. Skeletal muscle mass was derived from assessment of corrected arm muscle area and compared with skeletal muscle mass from dual energy X-ray absorptiometry analysis. Bland-Altman analysis was performed to determine the level of agreement between each field technique and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results:? Mean bias and limits of agreement between single frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry were ?5.7% (?24.0, 12.6), between multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (manufacturer's pre-programmed prediction equation) and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry were 1.4% (?13.4, 16.1), between multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (Dey et?al. prediction equation) and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry were ?5.0% (?16.6, 6.6) and between skeletal muscle mass as derived from assessment of corrected arm muscle area and skeletal muscle mass from dual energy X-ray absorptiometry analysis ?0.97?kg (?8.37, 6.43). Conclusion:? None of the methods assessed are clinically acceptable for assessment of body composition in older orthopaedic rehabilitation patients; however, estimation of skeletal muscle mass, as derived from corrected arm muscle area, is likely to be of more use in the clinical setting as there is no requirement for patients to be fasted.

Liporace, 3 Blagovast Nikolov, 4 Gwendolyn Taylor, 5 Melanee Newman, and 1 Andrew G. Herzog ( 1 Harvard Neuroendocrine Unit, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA ; 2 Harvard Clinical Research Institute, Boston, MA ; 3 Neurology, Weill Cornell Medical School, New York, NY ; 4 Neurology, Thomas Jefferson University Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA ; and 5 Neurology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA ) Rationale: Past observations in small studies have suggested that seizures may not occur randomly in the majority of women with epilepsy. They often tend to cluster (Tauboll et al. 1991; Bauer et al. 2001; Haut S et al. 2006). Systematic investigations in large prospective investigations, however, are lacking. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the distribution of seizure occurrence in women with localization related epilepsy. Methods: The present data come from the first 100 women, aged 13?45, who were participating in the baseline phase of a multicenter investigation of supplemental progesterone therapy for the treatment of intractable seizures in women with localization related epilepsy. The women recorded seizures and menses during 3 baseline menstrual cycles. A midluteal progesterone level ≥ 5 ng/ml was used to identify ovulatory cycles. The goodness of fit of the Poisson distribution to the distribution of seizures during the combined three-cycle observation period in each woman with ≥10 seizures was tested by chi square analysis. ?2 values >5.99 identified women with nonrandom seizure distributions. Nonrandom distributions were further categorized as uniform (variance/mean < 1) or clustered (variance/mean >1). Results were similar to an alternative method of testing nonrandom distributions against a uniform distribution for each subject using the Pearson chi square statistic with categorization as clustered if p value was ≤ .05. Results: 75 women had ≥10 seizures over the 3 month observation period. Seizure distributions in these 75 women were random in 29 (38.7%). Among the remaining 46 (61.3%) who had non-random distributions, 6 (8.0%) had uniform distributions and 40 (53.3%) had clustered distributions. Clustering was significantly more pronounced among women with anovulatory cycles than among women with ovulatory cycles (variance/mean ± 2 SD = 6.1 ± 5.3 vs 2.2 ± 1.7; t-test for independent samples: p = .006). No correlation was demonstrated between clustering and age of subjects, age of epilepsy onset, duration of epilepsy, EEG laterality and individual AEDs. Conclusions: The preliminary findings of this prospective study suggest that the majority (53.3%) of women with localization related epilepsy have clustered seizure distributions and that clustering may be significantly more common with anovulatory than ovulatory cycles.

Ward, and Epilepsy Radiosurgery Study Group ( 1 Neurology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA ; 2 Neurological Surgery, University of California San Francisco, Charlottesville, VA ; and 3 Neurology, University California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA ) Rationale: Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS) offers an alternative to open surgery for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), but its safety and efficacy are not well-established. We report the two year outcome on seizure remission and morbidities of a multicenter, prospective pilot study of GKS. Methods: Patients had unilateral MTLE as determined by standard presurgical evaluation. GKS, randomized to 20 Gy or 24 Gy comprising 5.0?7.5mL at the 50% isodose volume, was performed on mesial structures including the amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Treatment plans were approved at a central site to insure uniformity of lesions. Patients and primary treating physicians were blinded to dose. Regular visits with seizure diaries were obtained for 3 months at presurgical baseline and postoperatively for every three months until 18m, then at 24m. Patients were counted as ?seizure-free? if no seizures (excluding auras) occurred between visits 18m-24m. Any subject that was not available for analysis was considered not seizure-free. Results: Of 40 planned enrollments, 30 qualified resulting in 13 subjects in the high dose and 17 in the low dose group. 1 patient was lost to follow-up soon after treatment. 1 subject in the low-dose group underwent standard lobectomy after not being seizure-free 24 months following treatment. 1 subject experienced papilledema that responded partially to dexamethasone and underwent temporal lobectomy. Reductions in seizure frequency were seen in the high-dose group at 3, 6, 15, 18, and 24 months and for the low-dose group at 12, 15, 18, and 24 months (Wilcoxon signed rank test). Thus, both groups showed significant reductions in seizures at approximately one year following treatment. The low-dose group showed a seizure-free response at 24 months of ? 60% and the high-dose group response was ? 80% at 24 months. Although there is a difference in the seizure-free rates for the two treatment groups, the Fisher's Exact Test using a 2-sided p value indicates that the difference in percentage seizure-free for the two groups is not statistically significant (p = 0.1194), a conclusion limited by the low power to resolve differences between treatment groups. Rates of steroid treatment, new headaches, and visual field defects did not differ between dose or seizure-outcome groups. Conclusions: GKS may offer a safe and effective alternative to standard open surgery for unilateral MTLE. High-dose GKS may be more effective than low-dose without additional morbidity. Disadvantages of GKS include latency to seizure-freedom. Further work is required to determine which patients may benefit from GKS.

Fountain ( 1 Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA ) Rationale: The natural history of epilepsy, and particularly the rate of seizure freedom (SF), is generally unknown except in a few specific epilepsy syndromes. The rate of SF is generally regarded to be low if patients do not respond to the first two medications. However, our experience suggests that some patients with refractory epilepsy become SF. We hypothesized that the rate of SF is higher than expected and correlated with the seizure class and epilepsy syndrome. Methods: Standardized data were prospectively collected by epileptologists from established and new patients seen in the UVA Epilepsy Clinic from April 1998 to November 2004. Data were acquired directly from patients and medical records, refined and cleaned by standardized methods and updated at each clinic visit. Analysis was limited to patients with definite epilepsy > 5 years old. Frequency of each seizure (SZ) type was collected at each visit. Patients were categorized into 14 classes by the combination of SZ types they possessed and classified by ILAE syndromes. For each subject, monthly SZ frequency of each SZ type was plotted over time for the study duration. SF was defined as a total frequency of 0 for at least 6 mo. in patients who had at least 3 SZ frequency entries. Results: From 1638 subjects, 988 had 3 or more SZ frequency entries and were followed for a mean of 37 mo. SF developed in 25% (243), established SF was present throughout the time period in 23% (231), and 52% (514) continued to have seizures. Among those SF, mean duration of follow-up was 24.5 mo. and mean duration of SF was 20.9 mo. The majority (56%) of those SF had a moderately high baseline SZ frequency of 1?15/mo, while 21% had < 1/mo and 15% had a very high SZ frequency of >15/mo. Subjects with GTCs only were most likely to have a low SZ frequency (60%) and mixed types to have a very high frequency (67%). SF rate was highest for subjects with generalized SZs (113 of 355 subjects or 31%) and lowest for mixed SZs (6 of 28 subjects or 21%). SF rate was highest for idiopathic localization-related (53%) and idiopathic generalized (38%) and lowest for other generalized epilepsies (25%). Conclusions: An overall rate of seizure freedom of 48% with 25% becoming SF during the study period is higher than generally expected for established epilepsy. Patients with only generalized SZs, or idiopathic generalized and idiopathic localization-related epilepsies are more likely to become SF but some rate of SF develops in all SZ types and syndromes. It is likely that recall bias and other factors give clinicians the impression that only few patients with epilepsy are seizure free. This demonstrates that SF is a reasonable goal in the treatment of established epilepsy, depending on the SZ type and epilepsy syndrome. (Supported by University of Virginia.) 1 Susana E. Camposano, 1 David A. Lyczkowski, 1 Sonja K. Rakowski, and 1 Elizabeth A. Thiele ( 1 Herscot Center for TSC, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA ) Rationale: Epilepsy is the most common medical manifestation of TSC, with a high incidence of infantile spasms and partial epilepsy that often is refractory to medical treatment. We describe the incidence, prevalence, management, and control of seizures in a large population of patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients meeting clinical criteria for TSC who were seen through our TSC clinical program between January 1999 and November 2005. Results: 194 patients met criteria for TSC (mean age 16 years, range 7 months to 60 years), including 91 females. 172 (88.7%) had a history of seizures (mean age 14.8 years, SD 14.8). Twenty-two (11%) patients did not have a history of seizures (mean 24.1years, SD 13.7). The latter group was significantly older (Student's t test, p < 0.005). TSC diagnosis in patients with no seizure history diagnosis may be established later in life, and they might be underrepresented in our sample. Median age at seizure onset was 6 months (range, newborn to13 years average, mean 1.8 years). Sixty-nine patients (43% of those with seizures) had a history of infantile spasms. Of those who had DNA mutational analysis and seizures (n = 122), patients with IS had a higher proportion of TSC2 mutations compared to those without IS (41/56 with IS versus 28/66 without IS, ?2 p < 0.001) Seizure control Detailed information on 158 patients was available for seizure control analysis. At the time of the last visit, 55 (35%) had been seizure free for one year or longer. 33 (21%) of them, including 4 that underwent epilepsy surgery, were on medications, with an average of 3.28 (total, current and past, range 1to 11) antiepileptic drugs (AED). They had been seizure free for an average of 6.65 years, maximum 28 years. Twenty-three were on current mono-therapy. Twenty-two patients (14%), including 4 that had seizure surgery, were off medications and had been on an average number of 2.81 AEDs (range 1 to 6). Refractory epilepsy Seventy-three patients who had been treated with 3 or more treatments, including AEDs, vagal nerve stimulator (12), ketogenic diet (10), or low glycemic index treatment (2) without reaching seizure control for one year were classified as refractory. They did not differ in mutational frequencies from 26 non-refractory patients (?2= NS), who did achieve seizure control with one or two AEDs. Fifty-nine patients were excluded from this analysis, since they had not been treated with more than 2 AEDs or other treatments and had not achieved seizure control for one year. Epilepsy surgery was performed in 27 refractory patients; 10 of them eventually became seizure free. Nineteen refractory patients became seizure free after being treated with 3 or more AEDs. Conclusions: TSC comprises a wide epilepsy spectrum, with early onset of seizures, high IS incidence and high intractabilitity rates. Nonetheless 35% achieve complete seizure control. 1 Kimford J. Meador, 2 Nancy Browning, 3 Morris J. Cohen, 4 Laura Kalayjian, 5 Joyce Liporace, 6 Page B. Pennell, 7 Michael D. Privitera, 8 Andres Kanner, and 9 Debra T. Cantrell ( 1 Neurology, University of Florida, Gaineville, FL ; 2 EMMES Corporation, Rockville, MD ; 3 Neurology, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA ; 4 Neurology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA ; 5 Neuroscience, Riddle Health Care, Media, PA ; 6 Neurology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA ; 7 Neurology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH ; 8 Neurology, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL ; and 9 North Texas Epilepsy Center, Irving, TX ) Rationale: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can produce behavioral teratogenesis in animals at dosages less than required to produce anatomical teratogenesis. We sought to evaluate the cognitive effects of in utero AED exposure in humans in order to determine if differences exist across commonly prescribed AEDs. Methods: The NEAD Study is an ongoing prospective multicenter observational investigation, which enrolled pregnant women with epilepsy taking monotherapy carbamazepine (CBZ), lamotrigine(LTG), phenytoin (PHT), or valproate (VPA). The long-term goal of the study is to examine children from these pregnancies at 6 years old to determine if differential neuropsychological effects exist from in utero exposure across the four most commonly employed AEDs in pregnant women. This analysis is based on currently available results at 2 years old from the Mental Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development for 166 children (CBZ = 43, LTG = 57, PHT = 38, VPA = 28). The childrens' Mental Developmental Index (MDI) scores were analyzed by Analysis of Covariance controlling for maternal IQs. Results: Children exposed in utero to valproate had lower MDI scores at 2 years of age compared to the other 3 AEDs (p = .028). Follow-up pairwise comparisons revealed a significant difference for VPA-LTG (p = .018) and a trend for VPA-CBZ (p = .056). Mean (SD) MDIs were: CBZ = 94 (15), LTG = 97 (17), PHT = 90 (19), VPA = 85 (19). The percentages of children with MDI < 70 for each AED were: CBZ = 12%, LTG = 11%, PHT = 13%, VPA = 25%. The adverse effect of VPA was related to anticonvulsant blood level (p = .0001). Conclusions: These findings in conjunction with prior studies imply that in utero valproate exposure is more likely than other commonly used AEDs to impair cognitive development. Thus, valproate poses a greater risk for the unborn child for behavioral as well as anatomical teratogenesis. Additional studies are needed to confirm the present findings and to delineate the risks for other AEDs. (Supported by NIH/NINDS #2RO1 NS38455.) 1 Wayne M. Alves, 1 Yuhua Li, 2 Virinder Nohria, on behalf of the 205 Study Investigators ( 1 Research  and 2 Clinical Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA ) Rationale: Retigabine is a novel antiepileptic drug (AED) that enhances the potassium currents mediated by human KCNQ2/3 and KCNQ3/5 potassium channels and exhibits potent anticonvulsant activity in a broad spectrum of epilepsy animal models. The safety and efficacy of retigabine in refractory partial-onset seizures has been previously reported [1]. This report provides a descriptive analysis evaluating the efficacy of retigabine on complex partial seizures (CPS) in patients with refractory partial-onset epilepsy. Methods: 399 patients with partial-onset seizures (age range: 16?70 years, baseline seizure frequency: ≥4 seizures/month) participated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial. Study design included an 8-week baseline phase and 16-week double-blind treatment period (8-week forced titration and 8-week maintenance). Patients received either placebo or retigabine 600, 900, or 1200 mg/day and up to 2 approved AEDs. The primary efficacy variable was percent change from baseline in monthly total partial-seizure frequency. The percent change in monthly seizure rate for seizure types was considered as a secondary endpoint. Of 396 patients included in the efficacy analysis, 344 (86.9%) had CPS. 103 (26%) patients had simple partial seizures without secondary generalization (SPS). Results: Retigabine produced a linear dose-dependent reduction in monthly total partial-seizure frequency of 23%, 29% (p = 0.043), and 35% (p 0.001) for retigabine 600, 900, and 1200 mg/day, respectively, versus 13% for placebo. Looking at the most common seizure subtype, monthly CPS frequency was also significantly reduced. Median monthly CPS rate was reduced by 29.8% (p = 0.062), 26.5% (p = 0.064), and 40.0% (p = 0.002) for retigabine 600, 900, and 1200 mg/day, respectively, versus 14.8% for placebo. Monthly median SPS rate was reduced by 23.2% (p = 0.66), 34% (p = 0.77), and 37.6% (p = 0.15) for retigabine 600, 900, and 1200 mg/day, respectively, versus 15.2% for placebo. Conclusions: While retigabine is effective in reducing monthly total partial-onset seizures at 900 and 1200 mg/day, it appears to be effective in reducing the rate of complex partial seizures in all doses tested. Similar numerical trends for SPS frequency were observed but sample sizes are too small to draw a conclusion. Retigabine is currently undergoing global phase 3 studies as adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures in adults with refractory epilepsy. Reference 1 Porter P, Alves W, Nohria V, et al.

In a completed randomized, controlled trial (SP667), lacosamide (400 and 600 mg/day) reduced seizure frequency in subjects with uncontrolled partial seizures. Lacosamide has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile with low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. Methods: SP755 was an international, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that investigated the efficacy and safety of lacosamide in subjects with uncontrolled partial seizures taking 1 to 3 concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) with or without vagus nerve stimulation. Concomitant AEDs were held stable during an 8-week baseline. Subjects (n = 485) who reported at least 8 seizures with no more than a 21-day seizure-free period were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to placebo, lacosamide 200 or 400 mg/day (given bid), respectively. Subjects were titrated over 4 weeks to the randomized dose in 100 mg/week increments. Treatment was maintained for 12 weeks, followed by blinded transition to an open-label extension trial or discontinuation. Efficacy was evaluated with continuous and categorical intent-to-treat analyses of seizure frequency (maintenance vs baseline). Safety was evaluated with adverse event (AE), ECG, vital sign, and clinical laboratory data. Results: The median percent reduction in seizure frequency was 21%, 35%, and 36% for placebo, lacosamide 200 and 400 mg/day, respectively. The lacosamide 200 and 400 mg/day treatment groups were statistically significant over placebo in reducing seizure frequency from Baseline to the Maintenance Phase (p = 0.0223 and 0.0325, respectively). The 50% responder rates were 26%, 35%, and 41% for placebo, lacosamide 200 and 400 mg/day, respectively. Statistical analysis for responder rate over placebo was significant for lacosamide 400 mg/day (p = 0.0063) and approached significance for the 200 mg/day group (p = 0.0735). Rates for patient discontinuations from the trial for AEs were 6%, 6%, and 16% for placebo, lacosamide 200 and 400 mg/day, respectively. The most common (≥10% in any lacosamide group) AEs were dizziness, headache and diplopia. Conclusions: Data from this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that adjunctive lacosamide (200 and 400 mg/day) produced a statistically significant reduction in partial seizures in patients with uncontrolled partial seizures and support further development of lacosamide as an antiepileptic drug.

Li, and 1 Fernando Cendes ( 1 Department of Neurology, State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil ; and 2 Department of Medical Genetics, State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil ) Rationale: Idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE) are a group of epilepsies with generalized onset of the seizures. According to the main seizure type IGE are divided in subsyndromes. Routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is normal. The EEG supports the diagnosis when it shows the typical generalized spike and wave (GSW) discharges with normal background. Despite of these features, sometimes focal epileptiform discharges may be registered in the EEG. Some authors believe that these focalities represent fragmented GSW discharges but the pathophysiology of the focalities is still under investigation. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is a quantitative technique of MRI analysis that allows automatic comparison between images. This method also increases the sensibility to detect small areas of structural abnormalities. The objective of this study was to investigate the focalities present on the EEG records of patients with IGE using VBM. Methods: Patients were classified according to clinical and EEG features following previous recommendations. All patients had at least one EEG with typical GSW discharges and one with clear focal epileptiform discharges. All patients were submitted to MRI evaluation in a 2T MRI scanner (Elscint, Haifa, Israel). A 3D T1 gradient echo sequence with 1 mm isotropic voxels was used for VBM analysis. Images were previously processed using the software SPM2 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk). All images were submitted to spatial normalization, automatic segmentation, modulation and smoothing. The images of each patient were individually compared with a group of 47 controls (23 women, mean age 32 ± 14, range 19?67). Statistical analysis was performed searching for areas of gray matter concentration (GMC) abnormalities. The statistical level selected was a corrected p < 0.05 (false discovery rate). The localization of the focal discharges on the EEG was compared to the VBM results. Results: Twenty-two patients with IGE diagnosis were evaluated. Nine had juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), 6 patients had absence epilepsy (AE) and 7 had generalized tonic-clonic seizures on awakening (GTCS). Eight of the 9 (89%) patients with JME presented areas of GMC abnormalities. EEG analysis showed correspondence in 6 of 8 patients (75%). Five of 6 (83%) patients with AE presented areas of GMC abnormalities. EEG analysis showed correspondence in 3 of 5 patients (60%). Five of 7 (71%) patients with GTCS presented areas of GMC abnormalities. EEG analysis showed correspondence in 2 of 5 patients (40%). Conclusions: This study supports that subtle structural abnormalities characterized mainly by increased GMC may be responsible for the focal epileptiform discharges observed in the EEG of IGE. These focalities are also probably involved in the pathophysiology of the IGE.

The range of local field activity in human epileptogenic brain extends from DC to ?700 Hz. The clinical relevance of DC fluctuations, infraslow oscillations (0.01?0.1 Hz) and ultrafast oscillations (100?700 Hz) is unclear, but recent research supports the possible role of pathological high-frequency oscillations in the genesis of focal onset seizures. Methods: We studied 10 consecutive patients undergoing presurgical evaluation with hybrid subdural and depth electrodes. The custom hybrid depth and subdural electrodes (Adtech) used for intracranial EEG recordings contain an array of microwire electrodes (40 um?60 um) and clinical macroelectrodes (1?4 mm). The EEG was acquired using a DC coupled broadband amplifier operating in parallel with the clinical EEG acquisition system. Results: The broadband recordings from all 10 patients (5 neocortical grids and 5 temporal depth electrodes) showed oscillations extending from DC to ?700Hz. Infraslow oscillations and DC fluctuations tended to be more spatially distributed, but were most prominent in the region of seizure onset. Ultrafast oscillations (>100 Hz) were most often localized, and were most prominent within the seizure onset zone. The ultrafast oscillations were most evident on the microwire electrodes, and were modulated by slow frequency oscillations. Conclusions: Human epileptogenic brain generates local field oscillations that extend over a wide dynamic range (DC-700 Hz). In addition to activity in the usual clinical bands (?0.5?100 Hz) there are DC fluctuations and shifts, infraslow frequency oscillations (?0.01?0.1 Hz), and ultrafast oscillations (>100?700 Hz) present. The presence of ultrafast oscillations are often highly localized and most evident on microwire recordings, but can be absent from large clinical macroelectrodes. This suggests that clinical macroelectrodes (2 mm) may partially average out ultrafast local field potentials. (Supported by NIH/NINDS K23NS47495?03.) 1 Wenbo Zhang, 2,5 Deanna L.

MSI clinical application is receiving more attention. Presurgical functional brain mapping with MSI allows guidance during surgical decision-making and decreases the invasiveness of presurgical evaluation in epilepsy, brain tumor or cerebral vascular diseases. This report describes the patients tested and confirmed by invasive brain monitoring intraoperatively or with subdural grid placement, in the MSI Lab of Minnesota Epilepsy Group, PA and United Hospital at Saint Paul, Minnesota. Methods: Twenty-nine patients experienced both functional brain mapping with MSI (148-channel Magnes 2500 WH System, 4-D Neuroimaging, San Diego, CA) and invasive brain mapping (11 patients with intra-operative mapping, 18 with subdural electrode placement) in Minnesota Epilepsy Group between Dec 2004 and June 2006. Standard MSI protocols were applied for localization of language (word recognition task for receptive language mapping), somatosensory (pneumatic piston as stimuli), and primary motor cortex (voluntary finger tapping). The magnetic sources are modeled as a single equivalent dipole. The dipoles were superimposed onto the 3-dimensional SPGR MR images (1.4 mm slice thickness, no gap). Results: In the 29 patients, there were 8 patients with language mapping, 26 with motor mapping and 16 with somatosensory mapping. In the 51 brain function components, somtosensory and motor MSI dipoles were overlapped with the locations of invasive cortical mapping or located within 1 cm range from the sites of invasive cortical mapping; language MSI dipoles were located in the sulcus overlapped by cortical mapping on surface. There were no non-predicted neurological deficits after resective surgery in 28 patients. One patient did not experience resection due to the overlapping of motor cortex and epileptogenic focus. Conclusions: Functional brain mapping with MSI is an accurate tool to localize brain function for surgical planning. Using MSI information properly may reduce the number of invasive brain mapping procedures. 1 Chad Carlson, 3 Catherine Schevon, 4 Jeff Stout, 1 Siddhartha Nadkarni, 2 Werner Doyle, 2 Howard Weiner, 1 Steven Pacia, 1,2 Orrin Devinsky, and 1 Ruben Kuzniecky ( 1 Neurology, New York University, New York, NY ; 2 Neurosurgery, New York University, New York, NY ; 3 Neurology, Columbia University, New York, NY ; and 4 New York MEG, New York, NY ) Rationale: The lateralization and localization of partial seizures, particularly in extratemporal epilepsy syndromes, remains difficult despite improved diagnostic imaging and electroencephalographic techniques. Magnetic source imaging (MSI) is increasingly employed in the presurgical evaluation. This study retrospectively examines the positive predictive value (PPV) of MSI for lateralizing the epileptogenic zone. Methods: All epilepsy surgical cases performed after the availability of MSI (4-D Neuroimaging, equivalent current source dipole localization) at our center were identified. 163 surgeries in 152 patients were performed. 73 patients had a diagnostic pre-operative MSI. Results were available to the epilepsy team prior to surgery; however the MSI results did not directly affect the resection. We compared MSI lateralization to the ICEEG lateralization and resection. These results were reviewed in the context of the surgical outcome for patients with more than six months of post-surgical follow-up. Results: 12 of the 73 patients did not have resections due to non-lateralizable or non-localizable seizures or because their implants were diagnostic bilateral strip surveys. 30 patients had resections limited to the temporal lobe (4 with focal tumors). 3 patients had frontal tumors. 10 patients had multi-focal lesions secondary to tuberous sclerosis complex. The MSI was normal in 9 patients. Of those with an abnormal MSI, 39 had unilateral abnormalities ipsilateral to the resection and 6 had abnormalities limited to the contralateral hemisphere. 19 patients had bilateral findings, with 10 demonstrating a clear predominance ipsilateral to the resection. 40/61 patients undergoing resections had six or more months of follow-up. The PPV for MSI lateralization is shown in the table below. Positive Predictive Value of MSI for Lateralization of Epileptic Foci Number of Patients PPV PPV + Bilateral All Patients 73 61% ?77% Engel I Outcome 25/40 77% ?91% Engel II Outcome ?5/40 75% 100% Engel III Outcome ?6/40 67% ?67% Engel IV Outcome ?4/40 75% ?75% Engel II-I VOutcomes 15/40 71% ?78% PPV = Positive Predictive Value. PPV + Bilateral = Positive Predictive Value including patients with bilateral localizations with a predominance to the side of resection. Conclusions: This retrospective analysis demonstrates both the validity of MSI for lateralizing the epileptogenic zone as well as the method's limitations; the specificity of the MSI technique for predicting the epileptogenic zone cannot exceed its ability to lateralize correctly. Thus, clinicians should interpret the MSI in the context of other presurgical studies, rather than rely on it as an independent predictor of the epileptogenic zone. (Supported by FACES.) 1 Gregory L.

Methods: Subjects were 18?65 years with intractable partial-onset seizures and localized epileptogenic onset region(s). Subjects with ≥12 simple partial (SP) sensory or motor seizures, complex partial seizures (CPS) or generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures over an 84-day baseline period qualified for implant. The RNS was connected to up to 2 leads (subdural and/or depth), which were targeted to the seizure focus. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout the trial. Efficacy was assessed during two time periods, the 84-day period beginning 28 days post-implant (primary) and the most recent 84 days for which a subject could have received therapy (secondary). Results: During the primary evaluation period, the responder rate (≥50% reduction in seizures) in 50 subjects (excluding 1 subject with no disabling seizures at baseline and 14 subjects blinded off) was 32% for CPS (n = 44), 63% for GTC (n = 16), and 26% (n = 50) for total disabling seizures (TDS) (SP motor, CPS and GTC). The median percentage reduction in seizure frequency was: CPS 27%, GTC 59% and TDS 29%; seizure reduction was significant for CPS (p < 0.05) and TDS (p < 0.001) (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). For the secondary evaluation period, as of 4/28/06, the responder rate for 62 subjects (excluding 1 subject with no disabling seizures at baseline and 2 subjects previously blinded off with fewer than 84-days of therapy on) was 40% for CPS (n = 52), 55% for GTC (n = 22), and 41% for TDS (n = 61). The median percentage reduction was: CPS 34%, GTC 66% and TDS 35%, and seizure reduction was significant for CPS (p < 0.05), GTC (p < 0.005), and TDS (p < 0.001). In 65 implanted subjects (including 17 device replacements) representing 65 patient years, there were no serious unanticipated device-related AEs, and responsive neurostimulation was well tolerated. Conclusions: An investigation of the RNS? system demonstrated safety and a sustained reduction in CPS, GTC and TDS events. Preliminary results indicated that the RNS? system may provide a safe and effective treatment for adults with intractable partial-onset epilepsy. (Supported by NeuroPace, Inc.) 1 Angela Y.

Kissela ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH ; and 2 Department of Neurology, Department of Veteran's Affairs, Fresno, CA ) Rationale: Stroke-related seizures are frequently defined as early (within 2 weeks after stroke) and late. The incidence of early and late seizures is relatively well established. The incidence of acute seizures (≤24 hours after stroke) is unknown. In this population-based study, we aimed to establish the incidence of acute post-stroke seizures in a biracial cohort. We also sought to determine if there were any differences between race, stroke subtype, and stroke localization. Methods: All stroke cases between 7/93?6/94 within the population of the Greater Cincinnati metropolitan region were identified by review of all primary and secondary stroke diagnoses (ICD-9 codes 430?436) from 19 local acute-care hospitals, outpatient clinics, autopsy cases, and death certificates. Clinical and demographic data was collected by study nurses and subsequently reviewed by study physicians. The presence of seizures in the 24 hours after stroke symptom onset was obtained through additional record review; patients with a prior history of seizure were excluded. All available neuroimaging performed at the time of stroke was reviewed by study physicians. Variable Seizure No Seizure p-value Age (years) 67.0 ± 20.3 71.6 ± 13.0 0.01?

Of ICH/SAH patients, 11.4% had a seizure within the first 24 hours of stroke onset (p ≤ 0.0001 vs. all stroke). In ischemic stroke, we observed a trend towards seizures being more common with cardioembolic stroke vs. all other ischemic stroke subtypes (4.5% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.07). There was a higher mortality rate in patients who developed stroke-related acute seizures. See table for additional detail. Conclusions: The overall rate of epileptic seizures within the first 24 hours of stroke onset is 4.2%. Risk factors for developing seizure activity include younger age, lower initial GCS score, and hemorrhagic stroke (ICH/SAH). Patients with stroke-related acute seizures have a higher 30-day mortality than patients without seizures. This may be related to a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in this group. 1,2,3 N.

Methods: A retrospective analysis was carried out using data from 59 patients with left mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) who underwent en-bloc resection. Memory was measured by a standard word list-learning task (z-score for total number of words over 5 trials) administered before and after surgery. A new rating was devised for the MR images, to characterize the extent of hippocampal damage. Atrophy and signal change of the hippocampus were examined separately. Both changes were assessed on a scale: 0 = no change 1 = moderate atrophy/signal change, 2 = severe atrophy/signal change. The average of these two factors was calculated to classify the degree (range 0 to 2) of mesiotemporal sclerosis (MTS). The Wada results included number of correctly identified items after ipsilateral injection and contralateral injection (pass/fail boundary: 67%), as well as an asymmetry score. In various multiple regression analyses, Wada test scores (injection ipsilateral, injection contralateral, asymmetry score), neuropsychological test scores before surgery, MRI scores (atrophy, increased signal change, MTS) and further risk factors such as age of onset were entered as the independent variables. The difference in the verbal memory test was the dependent variable. Results: After surgery, 35% of the patients showed a memory decline indicated by a z-score loss of more than one point. The regression analyses revealed that the pre-operative memory test score was the strongest predictor of memory change (p < 0.05, adjusted R Square = 0.341). Higher preoperative performance in the verbal memory task was associated with a greater risk of verbal memory decline after surgery. The second significant predictor was the MTS classification (p < 0.05, adjusted R Square = 0.428). Greater damage to the hippocampus was associated with less decline following surgery. None of the other variables, including the Wada results and other risk factors, were significant predictors of memory outcome. Conclusions: The Wada test results did add to the prediction of verbal memory decline in this sample of patients in whom temporal lobe resection was considered safe with regard to the risk of amnesia (i.e., adequate memory functioning following ipsilesional injection compared to contralesional injection). Thus, the clinical data obtained routinely before surgery seems to be sufficient to predict risk of memory decline in the majority of TLE patients. However, our findings do not refute the usefulness of the Wada test for excluding from surgery those patients who are at risk for amnesia after temporal lobe resection. 1 Cigdem I. Akman, 1 Aviva Olgavsky, 1 Marla Hamberger, 1 Ronald Tikofsky, and 1 Frank Gilliam ( 1 Department of Neurology, Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Columbia University, College of Physicians  2 Neurology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea ; and 3 Biomedical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea ) Rationale: We investigated longitudinal changes in the volumes and shapes of the hippocampi of non-surgical and post-surgical patients with unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: Sixteen non-surgical patients had a repeat brain MRI with a mean interval of 3.7 years and 16 post-surgical patients had two postoperative MRI scans with a mean interval of 4.8 years. We measured ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampal volumes (IHV and CHV) in the non-surgical group and CHV in the postsurgical group. Hippocampal shape deformity analysis (HSDA) was also performed in each group. Results: In non-surgical patients, both IHV and CHV decreased significantly between the two scans (7.3 ± 5.7%, p < 0.001 and 2.5 ± 2.6%, p = 0.002). Moreover, IHV percent decreases were significantly correlated with the number of total seizures between the two scans (r = 0.57, p = 0.02). HSDA also showed inward deformities in both ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampi in non-surgical patients (uncorrected p < 0.05). In post-surgical patients, mean CHV (2481.1 ± 364.9 mm3) for first postsurgical scans was not significantly different from mean CHV (2480.4 ± 316.1 mm3) for second scans. Total seizure numbers during the year before surgery were negatively correlated with CHV losses between the two postsurgical scans (r =?0.72, p = 0.002). HSDA of contralateral hippocampi between the two postsurgical scans mainly showed outward deformities in head, body and tail but small inward deformities in tail. Conclusions: These results suggest that recurrent seizures induce progressive atrophy in both ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampi, but that a seizure-free state after the resection of an epileptic focus prevents longitudinal volume loss of the contralateral hippocampus and may facilitate a partial volume increase.

AB  - Introduction: Quantitative measures derived from the electroencephalogram (qEEG) have been used extensively in human medicine to assess the function of the brain under clinical manipulation (such as anesthesia and sedation), as well as in disease states (such as head trauma, coma and stroke). The goal of this study was to determine if qEEG measures could be used to predict the response of cats under isoflurane concentration to noxious stimuli. Methods: Twelve cats aged 1?2 years were included. Neurological and physical examination, blood chemistries and CBCs were normal in all cats. Anesthesia was induced with isoflurane (ISO) in O2, the cat was intubated and the femoral artery catheterized. The following physiologic data were collected continuously throughout the course of the experiment: temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, and end-tidal CO2 and ISO concentrations. An Aspect Medical Systems A-1050 monitor was used to continuously record the raw electroencephalogram (EEG) and several qEEG measures including bispectral index (BIS), spectral edge frequency (SEF), burst suppression ratio (BSR), and total EEG power (POW). ISO concentration was maintained constant for 15?minutes, after which a tail clamp was applied for 1?minute. If the cat responded, the concentration was increased 10% and the procedure repeated. If the cat did not respond, the ISO concentration was decreased 10% and the procedure repeated. The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) was the midpoint between a positive and negative response and, for each cat, this was determined three times. Results: BIS was significantly lower in cats at the lowest concentration at which there was no response (MAC?, 21.3±28.3) than at the highest concentration at which there was a response (MAC+, 63.4±22.1; p<.01, Wilcoxon signed rank). However, in 3/12 cats (25%), BIS was higher at MAC? than at MAC+. Of the other qEEG measures, only BSR was significantly different between MAC? and MAC+ (50.4±34.4 vs. 6.1±19.4, p<.01). Of the physiologic data collected, only respiratory rate was different between MAC? and MAC+ (29.4±10.0 vs. 45.3±17.9, p<.05). Conclusions: These results suggest that qEEG measures may be useful for anesthesia monitoring in cats, but measures that are less species-specific than the BIS may hold more promise. In addition, this work suggests that further studies utilizing qEEG measures for evaluation of sedation during ventilation as well as outcome prediction in animals with head trauma and critical illnesses with CNS complications are indicated.

AB  - A simple and rapid technique for the emergency removal of lung lobes was developed. It has been used successfully in 2 cats and 10 dogs without complications being recognized in any, with a minimum follow-up of four months. The purpose of this abstract is three-fold: 1) To briefly describe how the technique was done; 2) To describe the results of the use of the technique in these 14 emergency cases; and 3) Provide recommendations for the continued use of the technique in emergency cases. Method: The lung lobe requiring removal was selected and elevated; soft connective tissues around the lung lobe base were separated from the main pedicle using a fine curved scissors. With mild traction applied, 3 curved Halstead or Kelly hemostatic forceps were applied across the entire pedicle, one right after the other except for a break between the last 2 distal clamps. The lung lobe was removed by cutting the entire pedicle with a Metzenbaum scissors between the distal most clamps. The tips of the scissors were tilted slightly to produce a ?tissue bumper? of 1?3?mm above the distal most hemostatic forceps left. A Miller's knot of 3?0 to 2?0 polypropylene (cats and very small dogs) and 0 to 1 polypropylene (medium to large dogs) was applied around the entire pedicle under the clamps and tightened as the proximal most clamp was loosened briefly (flashed). The ends of the suture were continued to be carried around the pedicle in the direction they were coursing and then tied. A third ligation of the polypropylene was completed in large pedicles or where added security was deemed necessary such as in cases with a torn lung lobe due to trauma. Results: The procedure was used in emergency lung lobectomy in 2 cats involving 3 lobes and in 10 dogs. The reasons for emergency lobectomy were lung consolidation in 4 dogs (involving 6 lobes), trauma with severe tears or openings in 4 dogs (involving 6 lobes), a leaking congenital bulla in 1 dog, and 1 abscess/foreign body (wooden stick). Time taken to perform a lobectomy with this technique ranged from 3?7?minutes. No leaks or complications with the pedicle have been observed in any of the cases. Because only limited dissection is needed to perform the lobectomy, the author recommends this method over conventional lobectomy where artery, bronchus and vein are all managed individually.

AB  - Summary A 24-hour-old male Shetland pony was presented for evaluation of unilateral hindlimb lameness of unknown duration. Physical and radiographic findings confirmed a diagnosis of medial luxation of the patella. A traumatic or congenital aetiology was suspected but could not be confirmed. Surgical correction of the luxation, using a modified recession trochleoplasty technique, was carried out. At 6 months follow-up, no discernbile lameness could be observed. In the literature, descriptions of medially luxated patellae in equids are rare. Published reports describing the use of peri- and intra-articular surgical techiques for the correction of luxated patellae in equids are widely available. The modified recession trochleoplasty employed in this case may offer advantages over previously published techniques.

AB  - Although cases of retroperitoneal effusion associated with adrenal gland neoplasia have been reported in the veterinary literature, these clinical reports have been largely anecdotal. To our knowledge, no comprehensive evaluation of the causes or clinical indications of effusion (RPE) in the retroperitoneal space exists. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the causes, presenting signs, clinical findings and outcomes associated with RPE. The records of 23 cats and 44 dogs presenting to the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine between 1996 and 2003 and having been identified with RPE were reviewed. The presence of RPE was identified using abdominal ultrasonography. All of the cats and 84% (n=38) of dogs in this study presented through the Emergency Service. Diagnoses for RPE were categorized as follows: (Group 1) 14 dogs and 3 cats with acute renal failure associated with infection; (Group 2) 5 dogs and 6 cats with acute renal failure of unknown etiology; (Group 3) 3 cats with acute renal failure due to urinary tract obstruction; (Group 4) 8 dogs with adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 5) 7 dogs and 1 cat with non-adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 6) 5 dogs and 4 cats with other renal disease, and (Group 7) 5 dogs and 6 cats with RPF due to other causes. The most frequent presenting complaints in all categories except for those in Group 4 included anorexia, lethargy and vomiting. Physical examination findings were very similar for all categories except for those in Group 4 and included abdominal pain, dehydration, mental depression, lethargy and weakness. For those in Group 4, the most common complaints were collapse or marked weakness, anorexia, lethargy, and discomfort. The physical examination findings for dogs in Group 4 also included collapse or marked weakness, and abdominal distension. Percent mortality for dogs was 39% and, for cats, 43%. In each category, the percent mortalities are as follows (euthanized=e, died=d): Group 1: dogs: 14% (e n=1, d n=1), and cats: 33% (e n=1); Group 2: dogs: 100% (e n=4, d n=1) and cats 67% (e n=4).; Group 3: cats: 100% (e n=2, d n=1); Group 4: dogs: 32% (e n=3); Group 5: dogs: 71% (e n=5) and cats: 0%;. Group 6: dogs: 0% and cats: 25% (e n=1), and Group 7: dogs: 40% (e n=2) and cats: 17% (e n=1). Retroperitoneal effusion, regardless of cause, is associated with significant disease. In people, another category of disease associated with RPE is trauma. Although this category is not included in this study, abdominal ultrasonography of trauma victims may identify a veterinary population with RPE.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the acid-base, fluid, and electrolytes. Central diabetes insipidus (DI) is a failure of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) released from the posterior pituitary gland. Central DI manifests as polyuria with dilute urine in setting of hypertonic plasma. Failure of the urine osmolarity to increase after fluid restriction is diagnostic confirmation. Treatment is aimed at replacing free water deficits and vasopressin, an ADH analogue. Acidosis is from the loss of bicarbonate and not the addition of an acid, a normal anion gap is expected. A widened anion gap would be expected from an etiology that caused the addition of an acid. The loss of bicarbonate causes a gain of chloride ions to maintain electrical neutrality. Because of this, normal gap metabolic acidosis has also been referenced as ?hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis?. The treatment in this setting would be to replace fluids and electrolytes.

AB  - Abstract Antimicrobial properties of a long-chain, synthetic, cationic, and hydrophobic amino acid block copolymer are reported. In 5 and 60 min time-kill assays, solutions of K100L40 block copolymers (poly(l-lysine·hydrochloride)100-b-poly(l-leucine)40) at concentrations of 10?100 µg mL?1 show multi-log reductions in colony forming units of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as yeast, including multidrug-resistant strains. Driven by association of hydrophobic segments, K100L40 copolymers form viscous solutions and self-supporting hydrogels in water at concentrations of 1 and 2 wt%, respectively. These K100L40 preparations provide an effective barrier to microbial contamination of wounds, as measured by multi-log decreases of tissue-associated bacteria with deliberate inoculation of porcine skin explants, porcine open wounds, and rodent closed wounds with foreign body. Based on these findings, amino acid copolymers with the features of K100L40 can combine potent, direct antimicrobial activity and barrier properties in one biopolymer for a new approach to prevention of wound infections.

AB  - Summary Endocrine causes of hypertensive emergencies are easily overlooked when patients present with uncontrolled hypertension in association with evidence of end-organ damage. Emergencies arising from hypertensive crises due to pheochromocytoma can be particularly dangerous. To ensure appropriate therapeutic counter-measures and a favorable outcome, the presence of a catecholamine-producing tumor should be distinguished from more common etiologies as well as other uncommon endocrine causes, such as primary hyperaldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, and thyrotoxicosis. However, diagnosis at the time of the emergency can be made difficult by activation of the sympathoadrenal system resulting from the physiological stress of the clinical condition. Tests of catecholamine excess are therefore rendered problematic to interpret, with reliable diagnosis often only possible once and if the patient recovers. Because of this and time delays in obtaining test results, recognition of a possible endocrine cause in the emergency setting requires careful attention to patient history, presentation, and precipitating causes that may provide clues to underlying etiologies to guide therapeutic interventions.
