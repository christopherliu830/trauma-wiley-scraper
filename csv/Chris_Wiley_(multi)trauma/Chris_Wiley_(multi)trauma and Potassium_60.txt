AB  - 1 E. Ben-Menachem ( 1 Neurologkliniken, Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset, Goteberg, Sweden ) Lacosamide is in Phase 3 of clinical development for the adjunctive treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Currently the mode of action (MOA) is under investigation since it has been previously demonstrated that lacosamide does not share a MOA with other currently marketed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The drug can be administered orally or intravenously. Results from pharmacokinetic studies suggest that lacosamide has a low potential for drug-drug interactions, and it appears that lacosamide has a minimal risk for affecting the pharmacokinetics of commonly prescribed concomitant AEDs for the treatment of epilepsy. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial for the treatment of partial seizures (SP667), lacosamide was administered orally in doses of 200 mg, 400 mg and 600 mg divided in 2 daily doses. In this trial, lacosamide demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in seizure frequency over placebo. Moreover, the 50% responder rate (defined as patients with at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency) was statistically significant. A further trial (SP616) investigated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of IV lacosamide as replacement for oral lacosamide in patients with partial-onset seizures. The nature of AEs reported following 60- and 30 minute infusions of lacosamide was consistent with AEs reported following oral administration of lacosamide. Dose-related adverse events include dizziness, nausea, fatigue, ataxia, vision abnormal, diplopia, and nystagmus. The currently available results justify the further development of lacosamide for the treatment of epilepsy.

AB  - Abstract The brain ventricular system is a series of connected cavities, filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), that forms within the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS). The hollow neural tube is a hallmark of the chordate CNS, and a closed neural tube is essential for normal development. Development and function of the ventricular system is examined, emphasizing three interdigitating components that form a functional system: ventricle walls, CSF fluid properties, and activity of CSF constituent factors. The cellular lining of the ventricle both can produce and is responsive to CSF. Fluid properties and conserved CSF components contribute to normal CNS development. Anomalies of the CSF/ventricular system serve as diagnostics and may cause CNS disorders, further highlighting their importance. This review focuses on the evolution and development of the brain ventricular system, associated function, and connected pathologies. It is geared as an introduction for scholars with little background in the field.

AB  - Background: In critically ill patients who were surface cooled to 332C, we have observed that dopamine sometimes causes a substantial decrease in blood pressure. The present study was designed to compare the effects of dopamine in normothermia to those seen after surface cooling to 32C. Methods: Seven pigs with a mean body weight of 21 kg were anesthetized with ketamine and muscle relaxation was induced with pancuronium. They were mechanically ventilated and given dopamine infusions (5 and 12 ?g · kg-1 min-1) in normothermia and after surface cooling by cold water immersion to a central blood temperature of 320C (range 31.6?32.6C). Results: In normothermia, dopamine at a dose of 5 ?g · kg-1 min-1 increased mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) by 16% (P < 0.01) and cardiac output (CO) by 9% (P=0.051); at 12 ?g kg-1 min-1 dopamine increased MAP by 26% (P < 0.01) and CO by 18% (P < 0.01). In hypothermia, MAP and CO did not change at an administration rate of 5 ?g kg-l · min-1; at 12 ?g · kg-1 min-1 CO was unchanged but MAP was significantly reduced by 15% (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Dopamine increased CO and MAP in normothermia but not at 32C, where there was even a significant reduction of MAP in this porcine model.

AB  - Twenty-four?hour urine collection is the recommended method for estimating sodium intake. To investigate the strengths and limitations of methods used to assess completion of 24-hour urine collection, the authors systematically reviewed the literature on the accuracy and usefulness of methods vs para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) recovery (referent). The percentage of incomplete collections, based on PABA, was 6% to 47% (n=8 studies). The sensitivity and specificity for identifying incomplete collection using creatinine criteria (n=4 studies) was 6% to 63% and 57% to 99.7%, respectively. The most sensitive method for removing incomplete collections was a creatinine index <0.7. In pooled analysis (≥2 studies), mean urine creatinine excretion and volume were higher among participants with complete collection (P<.05); whereas, self-reported collection time did not differ by completion status. Compared with participants with incomplete collection, mean 24-hour sodium excretion was 19.6 mmol higher (n=1781 specimens, 5 studies) in patients with complete collection. Sodium excretion may be underestimated by inclusion of incomplete 24-hour urine collections. None of the current approaches reliably assess completion of 24-hour urine collection.
