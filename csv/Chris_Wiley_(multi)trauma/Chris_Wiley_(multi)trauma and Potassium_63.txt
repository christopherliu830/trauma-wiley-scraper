AB  - Summary One hundred and seventeen patients admitted to an intensive care unit were studied, to determine whether there is any relationship between laboratory data taken on admission to the unit and the final outcome (survival or non-survival) of the stay within the intensive care unit. Discriminant analysis of the data shows that patients could be allocated to one of two groups (survival or non-survival) using the two parameters of age and serum phosphate, and that this allocation proves correct in 70% of cases, irrespective of the admitting disease and treatment. The validity of this discriminant function was tested in a further 53 cases and the allocation of patients to survival or non-survival groups was found to be correct in 70% of cases, supporting the first estimate of the discriminant function.

AB  - Abstract Bleeding complications usually cause significant morbidity and mortality in civilian and military populations. In clinical application, hemostatic sponges, gauzes, hydrogel, and bandages are widely used as the traditional effective hemostatic products for hemorrhage. However, the traditional hemostatic devices or agents cannot meet the requirement for treatment of massive bleeding. Therefore, the excellent hemostatic performance of hemostatic products are of great significance for saving lives. Natural polysaccharides, as the main chemical component, have been widely used in the preparation of hemostasis due to their perfect biocompatibility and biodegradability. Polysaccharide based hemostatic products are available in variety of forms, such as, hydrogel, sponges, gauze and microspheres. The purpose of the present review is to report the research progress on polysaccharide hemostatic products and technology.

AB  - Abstract Here we report the first mediated pain free microneedle-based biosensor array for the continuous and simultaneous monitoring of lactate and glucose in artificial interstitial fluid (ISF). The gold surface of the microneedles has been modified by electrodeposition of Au-multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and successively by electropolymerization of the redox mediator, methylene blue (MB). Functionalization of the Au-MWCNTs/polyMB platform with the lactate oxidase (LOX) enzyme (working electrode 1) and with the FAD-Glucose dehydrogenase (FADGDH) enzyme (working electrode 2) enabled the continuous monitoring of lactate and glucose in the artificial ISF. The lactate biosensor exhibited a high sensitivity (797.4±38.1??A?cm?2?mM?1), a good linear range (10?100??M) with a detection limit of 3??M. The performance of the glucose biosensor were also good with a sensitivity of 405.2±24.1??A?cm?2?mM?1, a linear range between 0.05 and 5?mM and a detection limit of 7??M. The biosensor array was tested to detect the amount of lactate generated after 100?minutes of cycling exercise (12?mM) and of glucose after a normal meal for a healthy patient (10?mM). The results reveal that the new microneedles-based biosensor array seems to be a promising tool for the development of real-time wearable devices with a variety of sport medicine and clinical care applications.

AB  - Summary Symptomatic severe malarial anaemia (SMA) has a high fatality rate of 30?40%; most deaths occur in children awaiting blood transfusion. Blood transfusion services in most of Africa are not capable of delivering adequate supplies of safe blood in a timely manner to critically ill children with SMA. Contrary to widely held belief, hypovolaemia, rather than heart failure, has emerged as a common complication in such children. We examined the safety of pre-transfusion management (PTM) by volume expansion, aimed at stabilizing children and obviating the urgency for blood transfusion. Kenyan children with severe falciparum anaemia (haemoglobin?<?5?g/dl) and respiratory distress were randomly assigned to 20?ml/kg of 4·5% albumin or 0·9% saline or maintenance only (control) while awaiting blood transfusion. PTM was apparently safe since it did not lead to the development of pulmonary oedema or other adverse events. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome [mean percentage reduction in base excess between admission and 8?h (95% confidence interval)] between the control group 42% (19?66%) albumin group 44% (32?57%) and saline group 36% (16?57%); adjusted analysis of variance F?=?0·31, P?=?0·7. However, the number of children requiring emergency interventions was significantly greater in the control group, four of 18 (22%) than the saline group 0 of 20 (P?=?0·03). We have established the safety of this PTM in children with SMA whilst awaiting blood transfusion at a hospital with an adequate blood-banking program. The impact on mortality should be assessed where blood transfusion services are unable to supply emergency transfusions.

AB  - Summary Many neurological disorders that require pharmacotherapy in human patients are similar to those that require pharmacotherapy in veterinary patients. This chapter focuses on the most common veterinary neurological disorder that requires pharmacological treatment: epilepsy. Ketogenic diets have been used for managing epilepsy in people for decades. The goal of seizure management is to reduce the frequency and severity of seizures while minimizing adverse drug effects. Seizures are a common neurological disorder in dogs and cats. Diagnostic testing is dependent on the cause of the seizure. Polytherapy is considered when seizure control and quality of life are not achieved with monotherapy. In people, the classification and diagnosis of seizure type are critical to selection of the specific antiepileptic drug (AED). Monotherapy is preferred over polytherapy when initiating AED therapy. Due to pharmacokinetic variability and sensitivity to adverse drug effects, most veterinary patients are started at the lower end of the dose range initially.
