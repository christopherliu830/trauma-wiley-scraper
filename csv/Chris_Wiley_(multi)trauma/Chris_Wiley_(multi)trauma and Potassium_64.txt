AB  - Abstract Many different classification systems have been advocated for pulp diseases. However, most of them are based on histopathological findings rather than clinical findings which leads to confusion since there is little correlation between them. Most classifications mix clinical and histological terms resulting in misleading terminology and diagnoses. This in turn leads to further confusion and uncertainty in clinical practice when a rational treatment plan needs to be established in order to manage a specific pathological entity. A simple, yet practical classification of pulp diseases which uses terminology related to clinical findings is proposed. This classification will help clinicians understand the progressive nature of the pulp disease processes and direct them to the most appropriate and conservative treatment strategy for each condition. With a comprehensive knowledge of the pathophysiology of pain and inflammation in the pulp tissues, clinicians may accomplish this task with confidence.

AB  - The successful use of intrathecal baclofen, a structural analogue of ?-aminobutyric acid, is described in the treatment of a 9-year-old boy with intractable torsion dystonia, not responding to conservative treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of continuous intrathecal baclofen for hereditary torsion dystonia. This case suggests that a continuous intrathecal infusion of baclofen may facilitate remission of intractable torsion dystonia, and provides a basis for further investigation of the treatment of intractable childhood dystonia.

AB  - The number of new drugs for treating neurotrauma is rapidly expanding. Emerging theories regarding the mechanisms of secondary neuronal injury provide the scientific basis for evaluating these new agents. Some of the most promising mechanisms for intervention are ionotropic channel antagonism, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, and neurotrophic factor augmentation. Many of these new agents are undergoing clinical trials to establish their roles in therapy.

AB  - We have found a significant upregulation of L-type voltage-operated Ca++ channels (VOCCs) in reactive astrocytes. To test if VOCCs are centrally involved in triggering astrocyte reactivity, we used in vitro models of astrocyte activation in combination with pharmacological inhibitors, siRNAs and the Cre/lox system to reduce the activity of L-type VOCCs in primary cortical astrocytes. The endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as well as high extracellular K+, glutamate, and ATP promote astrogliosis in vitro. L-type VOCC inhibitors drastically reduce the number of reactive cells, astrocyte hypertrophy, and cell proliferation after these treatments. Astrocytes transfected with siRNAs for the Cav1.2 subunit that conducts L-type Ca++ currents as well as Cav1.2 knockout astrocytes showed reduce Ca++ influx by ?80% after plasma membrane depolarization. Importantly, Cav1.2 knock-down/out prevents astrocyte activation and proliferation induced by LPS. Similar results were found using the scratch wound assay. After injuring the astrocyte monolayer, cells extend processes toward the cell-free scratch region and subsequently migrate and populate the scratch. We found a significant increase in the activity of L-type VOCCs in reactive astrocytes located in the growing line in comparison to quiescent astrocytes situated away from the scratch. Moreover, the migration of astrocytes from the scratching line as well as the number of proliferating astrocytes was reduced in Cav1.2 knock-down/out cultures. In summary, our results suggest that Cav1.2 L-type VOCCs play a fundamental role in the induction and/or proliferation of reactive astrocytes, and indicate that the inhibition of these Ca++ channels may be an effective way to prevent astrocyte activation.

AB  - Background: Due to the high prevalence of obesity in adults, nutrition support clinicians are encountering greater numbers of obese patients who require nutrition support during hospitalization. The purpose of this clinical guideline is to serve as a framework for the nutrition support care of adult patients with obesity. Method: A systematic review of the best available evidence to answer a series of questions regarding management of nutrition support in patients with obesity was undertaken and evaluated using concepts adopted from the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group. A consensus process, that includes consideration of the strength of the evidence together with the risks and benefits to the patient, was used to develop the clinical guideline recommendations prior to multiple levels of external and internal review and approval by the A.S.P.E.N. Board of Directors. Questions: (1) Do clinical outcomes vary across levels of obesity in critically ill or hospitalized non?intensive care unit (ICU) patients? (2) How should energy requirements be determined in obese critically ill or hospitalized non-ICU patients? (3) Are clinical outcomes improved with hypocaloric, high protein diets in hospitalized patients? (4) In obese patients who have had a malabsorptive or restrictive surgical procedure, what micronutrients should be evaluated?

AB  - Abstract BackgroundDelirium is one of the most serious complications in hospitalized elderly, with incidences ranging from 3?56%. The objective of this meta-analysis was two-fold, first to investigate if interventions to prevent delirium are effective and second to explore which factors increase the effectiveness of these interventions. MethodsAn electronic search was carried out on articles published between January 1979 and July 2009. Abstracts were reviewed, data were extracted and methodologic quality was assessed by two independent reviewers. Effect sizes of the interventions were expressed as ORs (odds ratios) and 95%CIs (confidence intervals). A random effect model was used to provide pooled ORs. To explore which factors increase the effectiveness of the interventions, ORs were stratified for several factors. ResultsSixteen relevant studies were found. Overall the included studies showed a positive result of any intervention to prevent delirium (pooled OR: 0.64; 95%CI: 0.46?0.88). The largest effect was seen in studies on populations with an incidence of delirium above 30% in the control group (pooled OR: 0.34; 95%CI: 0.16?0.71 versus 0.76; 95%CI: 0.60?0.97). ConclusionsInterventions to prevent delirium are effective. Interventions seem to be more effective when the incidence of delirium in the population under study is above 30%. To maximize the options for a cost-effective strategy of delirium prevention it might be useful to offer an intervention to a selected population. Copyright ? 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
