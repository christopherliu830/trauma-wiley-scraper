AB  - Abstract Introduction The identification and characterisation of cellular metabolites has now become an important strategy to obtain insight into functional plant biology. However, the extraction of metabolites for identification and analysis is challenging and, at the present time, usually requires destruction of the plant. Objective To detect different plant metabolites in living plants with no pre-treatment using the combination of iontophoresis and ion-chromatography with mass spectrometry detection. Methodology In this work, the simple and non-destructive method of reverse iontophoresis has been used to extract in situ multiple plant metabolites from intact Ocimum basilicum leaves. Subsequently, the analysis of these metabolites has been performed with ion chromatography coupled directly to high resolution mass spectrometric detection (IC-MS). Results The application of reverse iontophoresis to living plant samples has avoided the need for complex pre-treatments. With this approach, no less than 24 compounds, including organic acids and sugars as well as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were successfully detected. Conclusion The research demonstrates that it is feasible to monitor, therefore, a number of important plant metabolites using a simple, relatively fast and non-destructive approach.

AB  - Background and Objectives Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler?Weber?Rendu disease, causes recurrent mucous membrane hemorrhage, especially epistaxis. In this systematic review, we discuss the efficacies of the three most common laser photocoagulation treatments for HHT-related epistaxis. Study Design/Materials and Methods A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and MEDLINE from database inception to March 2019. Studies reporting epistaxis outcomes following argon, neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG), and diode laser photocoagulation for HHT were included. ?2 and Barnard's exact tests were utilized to detect differences in reduced epistaxis frequency and intensity rates. Results Fifteen out of 157 published studies met our eligibility criteria, spanning a collective 362 patients. Argon, Nd:YAG, and diode laser therapy reduced epistaxis frequency in 90.4%, 88.9%, and 71.1% of patients, respectively, and reduced epistaxis intensity in 87.8%, 87.2%, and 71.1% of patients, respectively. Diode laser photocoagulation significantly underperformed in both outcome measurements when compared with argon (frequency: P?=?0.005; intensity: P?=?0.034) and Nd:YAG (frequency: P?=?0.012; intensity: P?=?0.041). There was no significant difference between argon and Nd:YAG in reducing HHT epistaxis frequency (P?=?0.434) or intensity (P?=?0.969). Categorizing HHT patients by clinical severity demonstrated a higher rate of improvement in the mild-moderate group compared with the severe group in both argon (P?<?0.001) and Nd:YAG (P?<?0.001) therapeutic methods. While no significant differences were found in rates of improved epistaxis outcomes between argon and Nd:YAG in mild-moderate HHT patients (frequency: P?=?0.061; intensity: P?=?0.061), Nd:YAG demonstrated greater rates of reduction in epistaxis frequency (P?=?0.040) and intensity (P?=?0.028) than argon among severe HHT patients. Conclusions HHT is a lifelong disease, plaguing patients with debilitating epistaxis. Intranasal laser photocoagulation of telangiectasias using argon or Nd:YAG laser therapy can yield improved epistaxis outcomes compared with diode laser photocoagulation. In severe cases of HHT, Nd:YAG laser therapy provides greater improvements in epistaxis outcomes than argon photocoagulation. Lasers Surg. Med. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? Peyronie's Disease (PD) has been studied for more than 260 years since Francois de la Peyronie's description in 1743. Based on the current literature, the prevalence of PD seems 3?9% with an average age of onset in the fifth life decade. Much effort has been spent on developing nonsurgical treatment options to cure or at least prevent disease progression. Aim.? The recent examination of drug trials for erectile dysfunction has led us to assess PD trial methodology more closely. Methods.? An Iinternet search on PubMed was performed using MeSH words PD, clinical trials, oral, transdermal, intralesional and shock wave therapy focusing on 26 representing studies published over the last 15 years. Mean Outcome Measures.? A comprehensive review of the current literature on nonsurgical treatment options for PD was conducted to address methodological issues and challenges in PD trials highlighting trial design, patient population, and symptom and sign assessment. Results.? The majority of the reviewed studies are underpowered and the heterogeneity in the methodological approach and patient assessment between the studies is one of the remarkable findings from our review. Studies should use a uniform means of defining the degree and type of penile deformity and a large enough cohort of patients should be studied for adequate study power. An ideally designed PD intervention trial should comprise: (i) a randomized, placebo-controlled design; (ii) with a PD patient set representative of the general PD population; and (iii) a comprehensive symptom and sign assessment before and at the end of treatment which includes an assessment of at least deformity, pain, and sexual function. Conclusion.? A number of challenges exist for the design of PD intervention trials and deciphering the data generated from them. The field would benefit greatly from a consensus statement or guidelines development on the design and conduct of such trials. Müller A, and Mulhall JP.

AB  - Abstract Alcohol (ethanol) is man's favorite recreational drug and the psychoactive substance most often encountered in forensic toxicology casework; impaired driving cases, sexual assaults, and drug intoxication deaths. Because of the legal consequences of a person's blood? or breath?alcohol concentration (BAC or BrAC), the analytical methods used must be accurate, precise, and fit for purpose. The gold standard method for determination of ethanol in blood and other biological specimens is gas?liquid chromatography with flame ionization detector, although some laboratories also use a mass spectrometric detector. Also widely used for legal purposes are breath?alcohol analyzers; at the roadside as screening tests and also as evidence for prosecution of traffic offenders. Evidential instruments determine ethanol in exhaled breath by infrared spectrometry at wavelengths of 3.4 and/or 9.5 ?m or by electrochemical oxidation with a fuel-cell detector. The impairment of body functions after drinking alcohol depend on the amount consumed (the dose), the speed of drinking and the BAC reaching the brain. After drinking 1?2 units of alcohol (~16?g ethanol) people become more talkative and feel less inhibited (BAC <50?mg%). Cognitive and psychomotor functions are impaired as BAC reaches 80?mg% and at 150?mg% the signs and symptoms of alcohol intoxication are much more obvious including slurred speech, lack of coordination, confusion, and combativeness. On reaching BACs of 300?400?mg% most people are incapacitated and/or unconscious with slow and shallow breathing and at risk of death from paralysis of respiratory centers in the brain stem.

AB  - Abstract This investigation examined the consequences of neonatal deafness and chronic intracochlear electrical stimulation delivered by a cochlear implant during maturation. Kittens were bilaterally deafened by an ototoxic drug administered daily for 2 weeks immediately after birth. Unilateral electrical stimulation was initiated at 7?10 weeks of age and continued over periods of 22?47 weeks (4 hours/day; 5 days/week). Bipolar intracochlear electrodes delivered one of several different electrical signals designed to be temporally challenging to the central auditory system. Morphometric evaluation of spiral ganglion (SG) cell somata within Rosenthal's canal demonstrated a mean of ≈50% of normal cell density maintained in the chronically stimulated ears, compared with ≈30% on the control deafened side. This 20% difference in density was highly significant and was greater than differences reported in earlier studies using 30 pps stimulation delivered by either intracochlear bipolar or round window monopolar electrodes. However, the duration of stimulation was also longer in the present study, so it is unclear to what extent the nature of the temporally challenging stimulation vs. its duration contributed to the marked increase in survival. Measurements of the SG cell somata revealed a pronounced decrease in cell diameter in neonatally deafened cats studied about 1 year after deafening, and an additional decrease after long-term deafness (2.5?6.5 years). Furthermore, in the cochlear regions with the greatest stimulation-induced differences in SG cell density, direct measurements of cross-sectional soma area of the largest cells revealed that cells were significantly larger in the stimulated ears. Thus, in addition to the marked increase in the number of surviving SG cells, larger soma area contributed modestly to the pronounced increase in neural density following chronic electrical stimulation.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the background and uses, physical and chemical properties, mammalian toxicology, industrial hygiene and medical management of halogens. The halogens include chlorine, hydrogen chloride, chlorine dioxide, hydrogen fluoride, iodine and bromine. Acute exposure to chlorine gas happens quite regularly at homes and in industries. Hydrogen chloride is a pyrolysis product of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and is considered the principal toxic component of PVC smoke. The metabolism of chlorine dioxide yields a number of different compounds, including chlorite, chlorate, chloramine, and chlorine. Exposure to hydrogen fluoride and its aqueous solution can occur through inhalation, ingestion, and eye or skin contact. Skin eruptions, fever, and hypersensitivity reactions are commonly reported during overexposure of iodine. Severe acute exposure to chlorine can result in residual pulmonary dysfunction, particularly RADS, asthma, and low residual volumes in some patients.
