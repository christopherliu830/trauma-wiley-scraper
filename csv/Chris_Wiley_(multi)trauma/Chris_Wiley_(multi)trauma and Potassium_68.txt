AB  - Background and Objectives Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler?Weber?Rendu disease, causes recurrent mucous membrane hemorrhage, especially epistaxis. In this systematic review, we discuss the efficacies of the three most common laser photocoagulation treatments for HHT-related epistaxis. Study Design/Materials and Methods A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and MEDLINE from database inception to March 2019. Studies reporting epistaxis outcomes following argon, neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG), and diode laser photocoagulation for HHT were included. ?2 and Barnard's exact tests were utilized to detect differences in reduced epistaxis frequency and intensity rates. Results Fifteen out of 157 published studies met our eligibility criteria, spanning a collective 362 patients. Argon, Nd:YAG, and diode laser therapy reduced epistaxis frequency in 90.4%, 88.9%, and 71.1% of patients, respectively, and reduced epistaxis intensity in 87.8%, 87.2%, and 71.1% of patients, respectively. Diode laser photocoagulation significantly underperformed in both outcome measurements when compared with argon (frequency: P?=?0.005; intensity: P?=?0.034) and Nd:YAG (frequency: P?=?0.012; intensity: P?=?0.041). There was no significant difference between argon and Nd:YAG in reducing HHT epistaxis frequency (P?=?0.434) or intensity (P?=?0.969). Categorizing HHT patients by clinical severity demonstrated a higher rate of improvement in the mild-moderate group compared with the severe group in both argon (P?<?0.001) and Nd:YAG (P?<?0.001) therapeutic methods. While no significant differences were found in rates of improved epistaxis outcomes between argon and Nd:YAG in mild-moderate HHT patients (frequency: P?=?0.061; intensity: P?=?0.061), Nd:YAG demonstrated greater rates of reduction in epistaxis frequency (P?=?0.040) and intensity (P?=?0.028) than argon among severe HHT patients. Conclusions HHT is a lifelong disease, plaguing patients with debilitating epistaxis. Intranasal laser photocoagulation of telangiectasias using argon or Nd:YAG laser therapy can yield improved epistaxis outcomes compared with diode laser photocoagulation. In severe cases of HHT, Nd:YAG laser therapy provides greater improvements in epistaxis outcomes than argon photocoagulation. Lasers Surg. Med. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Background Newborn animal studies and pilot studies in humans suggest that mild hypothermia following peripartum hypoxia-ischaemia in newborn infants may reduce neurological sequelae without adverse effects. Objectives To determine the effect of therapeutic hypothermia in encephalopathic asphyxiated newborn infants on mortality, long-term neurodevelopmental disability and clinically important side effects. Search strategy The standard search strategy of the Neonatal Review Group as outlined in The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2007) was used. Randomised controlled trials evaluating therapeutic hypothermia in term newborns with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy were identified by searching the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2007), previous reviews including cross-references, abstracts, conferences, symposia proceedings, expert informants and journal hand searching. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing the use of therapeutic hypothermia with standard care in encephalopathic newborn infants with evidence of peripartum asphyxia and without recognisable major congenital anomalies were included. The primary outcome measure was death or long-term major neurodevelopmental disability. Other outcomes included adverse effects of cooling and 'early' indicators of neurodevelopmental outcome. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently selected, assessed the quality of and extracted data from the included studies. Authors were contacted for further information. Meta-analyses were performed using relative risk and risk difference for dichotomous data, and weighted mean difference for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals. Main results Eight randomised controlled trials were included in this review, comprising 638 term infants with moderate/ severe encephalopathy and evidence of intrapartum asphyxia. Therapeutic hypothermia resulted in a statistically significant and clinically important reduction in the combined outcome of mortality or major neurodevelopmental disability to 18 months of age [typical RR 0.76 (95% CI 0.65, 0.89), typical RD -0.15 (95% CI -0.24, -0.07), NNT 7 (95% CI 4, 14)]. Cooling also resulted in statistically significant reductions in mortality [typical RR 0.74 (95% CI 0.58, 0.94), typical RD -0.09 (95% CI -0.16, -0.02), NNT 11 (95% CI 6, 50)] and in neurodevelopmental disability in survivors [typical RR 0.68 (95% CI 0.51, 0.92), typical RD -0.13 (95% CI -0.23, -0.03)]. Some adverse effects of hypothermia included an increase in the need for inotrope support of borderline significance and a significant increase in thrombocytopaenia. Authors' conclusions There is evidence from the eight randomised controlled trials included in this systematic review (n = 638) that therapeutic hypothermia is beneficial to term newborns with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy. Cooling reduces mortality without increasing major disability in survivors. The benefits of cooling on survival and neurodevelopment outweigh the short-term adverse effects. However, this review comprises an analysis based on less than half of all infants currently known to be randomised into eligible trials of cooling. Incorporation of data from ongoing and completed randomised trials (n = 829) will be important to clarify the effectiveness of cooling and to provide more information on the safety of therapeutic hypothermia, but could also alter these conclusions. Further trials to determine the appropriate method of providing therapeutic hypothermia, including comparison of whole body with selective head cooling with mild systemic hypothermia, are required. Plain Language Summary Cooling for newborns with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy There is evidence that induced hypothermia (cooling) of newborn babies who may have suffered from a lack of oxygen at birth reduces death or disability, without increasing disability in survivors. This means that parents should expect that cooling will decrease their baby's chance of dying, and that if their baby survives, cooling will decrease his/her chance of major disability. A lack of oxygen before and during birth can destroy cells in a newborn baby's brain. The damage caused by the lack of oxygen continues for some time afterwards. One way to try and stop this damage is to induce hypothermia - cooling the baby or just the baby's head for hours to days. This treatment may reduce the amount of damage to brain cells. This review found that there is evidence from trials to show that induced hypothermia helps to improve survival and development at 18 months for term newborn babies at risk of brain damage. The results of ongoing trials may or may not confirm these favourable results. More research is also needed on the different methods of cooling.

AB  - Abstract Aim Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to control postoperative pain; however, their postoperative use has been associated with anastomotic leakage after gastrointestinal surgery. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the correlation between the use of NSAIDs and anastomotic leakage. Methods We conducted a comprehensive electronic literature search up to August 2018 to identify studies comparing anastomotic leakage in patients with and without postoperative NSAID use following gastrointestinal surgery. We then carried out a meta-analysis using random-effects models to calculate odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Twenty-four studies were included in this meta-analysis, including a total of 31 877 patients. Meta-analysis showed a significant association between NSAID use and anastomotic leakage (OR 1.73; 95% CI = 1.31-2.29, P < .0001). Subgroup analyses showed that non-selective NSAIDs, but not selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, were significantly associated with anastomotic leakage. However there was no significant subgroup difference between selective and non-selective NSAIDs. Conclusion Results of this meta-analysis indicate that postoperative NSAID use is associated with anastomotic leakage following gastrointestinal surgeries. Caution is warranted when using NSAIDs for postoperative analgesic control in patients with gastrointestinal anastomoses.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aim Infection is a leading precipitant of acute-on-chronic liver failure. This study aims to determine the safety and efficacy of antibiotics within acute-on-chronic liver failure. Methods Retrospective study of 457 acute-on-chronic liver failure patients admitted to the University of Arizona Health Network between January 1 and December 31, 2014. Eligibility criteria were as follows: at least 18 years of age and 6 months follow-up, data available to calculate systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and acute-on-chronic liver failure. This study collected patient's clinical features and historical data. Key data points were infection, antibiotic use, and SIRS. This study used Cox proportional hazards to model the effects of clinical factors on risk of death. Results A total of 521 of 1243 met the inclusion criteria, and 64 had missing data, leaving 457 patients. Infection resulted in higher hazard (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.6, confidence interval [CI]: 1.1?1.3, P = 0.01). Patients with infections and antibiotics, compared with non-infected patients without antibiotics, had higher hazard (HR = 1.633, CI: 1.022?2.609, P = .04). Of those infected patients with antibiotics, SIRS patients experienced higher hazard (HR = 1.9, CI: 1.1?3.0, P = .007). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards associated the following with higher hazard: SIRS (HR = 1.866, CI: 1.242?2.804, P = 0.003), vancomycin (HR = 1.640, CI: 1.119?2.405, P = 0.011), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (HR = 1.051, CI: 1.030?1.073, P < 0.001), gastrointestinal bleeding (HR = 1.727, CI: 1.180?2.527, P = 0.005), and hepatic encephalopathy (HR = 1.807, CI: 1.247?2.618, P = 0.002). Conclusion Overall, treatment of infection with antibiotics did not improve survival; however, patients not meeting SIRS criteria had better outcomes, and vancomycin was associated with poorer survival among acute-on-chronic liver failure patients.

AB  - Summary Anesthesia is a very complex, dynamic domain that is labor intensive, can be equipment intensive, and requires accuracy and attention to detail for a good outcome. Errors and unforeseen events occur with low frequency, catastrophic events usually cannot be predicted, and mistakes are not always reversible. Derangements of cardiovascular function occur commonly in most species under anesthesia. Treatment of hypotension should be aimed at the probable cause, but generally should start with a reduction in anesthetic depth and a fluid bolus. Cardiac dysrhythmias occur in >60% of human patients undergoing anesthesia and surgery, and seem as prevalent in animal patients. Treatment involves correcting any obvious physiologic abnormalities (low pH, hypercarbia, hypoxia, electrolyte derangements such as low K+) and administering antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., lidocaine or procainamide). When tachycardia, arrhythmias, and hypotension are present, oxygen, IV fluids, IV antihistamines (diphenhydramine), and corticosteroids are indicated for treatment and occasionally epinephrine and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) will be necessary.

AB  - Wearable or attachable health monitoring smart systems are considered to be the next generation of personal portable devices for remote medicine practices. Smart flexible sensing electronics are components crucial in endowing health monitoring systems with the capability of real-time tracking of physiological signals. These signals are closely associated with body conditions, such as heart rate, wrist pulse, body temperature, blood/intraocular pressure and blood/sweat bio-information. Monitoring such physiological signals provides a convenient and non-invasive way for disease diagnoses and health assessments. This Review summarizes the recent progress of flexible sensing electronics for their use in wearable/attachable health monitoring systems. Meanwhile, we present an overview of different materials and configurations for flexible sensors, including piezo-resistive, piezo-electrical, capacitive, and field effect transistor based devices, and analyze the working principles in monitoring physiological signals. In addition, the future perspectives of wearable healthcare systems and the technical demands on their commercialization are briefly discussed.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the current scientific literature on ischemia?reperfusion (IR) injury in both human and veterinary medicine. To describe the normal antioxidant defense mechanisms, the pathophysiology of IR injury, and the role of neutrophils in IR injury. Data sources: Data sources include scientific reviews and original research publications in both human and veterinary medicine. Summary: IR injury is a complex pathophysiological process involving numerous pathways and body systems. Normal antioxidant defense mechanisms function to limit oxidative injury during times of health. Ischemia is the period that occurs before oxygenated blood is re-introduced and the severity of injury has been shown to correlate with the magnitude and length of ischemia in dogs. During ischemia, there is a buildup of substances (i.e., xanthine oxidase, hypoxanthine, etc.) that, upon re-introduction of oxygen, form reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS, produced in large part upon reperfusion, can cause extensive damage to DNA, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Although mammalian systems are endowed with abundant antioxidant defenses, the generation of large amounts of ROS can overwhelm these mechanisms leading to cell dysfunction and death. Neutrophils play a critical role in IR injury and may mediate the majority of mucosal and microvascular injury that occurs by releasing ROS and proteolytic enzymes. Although experimental studies have been carried out on cats, dogs, and horses there are few clinical studies on companion animals. Conclusions: The pathophysiology of IR injury is complex and involves damage by ROS to all biological membranes. Neutrophils play a major role in IR injury and initiate and propogate much of the damage. This article is intended as a review of the pathophysiology of IR injury.
