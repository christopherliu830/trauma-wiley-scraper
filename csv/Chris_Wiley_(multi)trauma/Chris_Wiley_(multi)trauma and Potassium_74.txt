AB  - Summary This chapter outlines the specific pharmacology and techniques for the most commonly used opioid analgesic agents, which are also applied to anesthetic procedures. Opioid receptors are located in the nervous system and peripheral organs; therefore, their actions impact the brain, spinal cord, heart, lungs, gastrointestinal system, liver,musculoskeletal and reproductive organs. All mu-agonists are schedule N drugs (narcotics), for which records of administration must be kept due to the higher potential for abuse and dependence. Butorphanol is a mixed agonist-antagonist. Its kappa-agonistic actions confer analgesic and sedative effects as well, but it antagonizes the actions of mu-agonists if administered concomitantly. Hydrocodone is a mu opioid agonist that is available as oral combination preparations. There is limited data on the efficacy of hydrocodone in veterinary medicine experimentally or clinically, hence strong recommendations cannot be made to use oral hydrocodone for analgesia.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? This study was designed to provide data on the efficacy, dose response, incidence and duration of adverse effects of flupirtine in the treatment of cancer-related neuropathic pain. Methods:? This was an 8-day, open label, dose escalation study of inpatients in a palliative care unit. After ethics committee approval, patients with moderate to severe neuropathic pain in spite of opioid treatment received an initial dose of flupirtine 100?mg four times daily (QID). This dose could be escalated by 100?mg QID every 2 days to a maximum of 300?mg QID. Efficacy measures included: 11 point scales measuring average pain and worst pain; a neuropathic pain discriminant score; 11 point scales for quality of life activities and a score of percentage pain relief (0?100%). Results:? Ten Patients were recruited into the study; only one patient was withdrawn because of side effects thought to be due to the flupirtine. There were significant reductions of average pain (p?=?0.0008), worst pain (p?=?0.0168) and neuropathic pain discriminant scores (p?<?0.0001; see figure). There were also significant improvements in the quality of life measures (p?=?0.0017), a reduction of adverse symptoms (p?=?0.0017) and an increase in percentage pain relief (p?=?0.0078). Additionally there occurred a statistically non-significant downward trend in opioid use. Eight patients elected to continue to take flupirtine after the trial, two taking 200?mg QID and the others 100?mg QID. Of these eight, six said that flupirtine was of considerable help and two said that it helped only a little. Conclusions:? Flupirtine is effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain caused by cancer when used in combination with opioids. This compound merits further investigation for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with other etiologies.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? To identify problems in the biopsychosocial model when applied to people in pain and to explore a resolution. Methods:? Critical analysis of the literature concerning the theory and application of biopsychosocial models to the practice of pain medicine Results:? The biopsychosocial model for understanding illness has generated the IASP definition of pain, two simpler conceptual frameworks, and three explanatory schemata for pain. However, in the absence of a theory of living systems that seeks to understand how the different domains of these schemata interact with each other, these attempts have been caught in circular argument and have been unable to transcend either biomedical reductionism or the perpetuation of body-mind dualism. In particular, the implication that pain is a ?thing? separate and distinct from the body not only bears little relationship to the lived experience of pain but also emphasises the inherent problem that arises when an observer attempts to reduce the experience of the pain of ?the other? to predictable parameters. Conclusions:? The self-referentiality of living systems (through their qualities of autopoiesis, non-centrality and negentropy) sees pain ?emerge? in unpredictable ways that defy any reduction of the lived experience to any particular ?thing.? Pain therefore constitutes an aporia,a space and presence that deny us access to its secrets. We suggest a project in which pain may be approached in the clinical encounter through the engagement of two autonomous self-referential beings from which new therapeutic possibilities can arise. We see three challenges to be met in this project: to accept that the pain of another person is irreducible to its neuronal correlates; to acknowledge all the principles which characterise autonomous biological systems; and to allow a rapprochement between the world of the clinician and the world of the person in pain.

AB  - Abstract Oxygen is frequently administered to patients with suspected stroke. However, the role of oxygen therapy in ischemic stroke remains controversial in light of the failure of three clinical trials of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to show efficacy, and the fear of exacerbating oxygen free radical injury. The previous trials had several shortcomings, perhaps because they were designed on basis of anecdotal case reports and little preclinical data. Most animal studies concerning oxygen therapy in stroke have been conducted over the last 6 years. Emerging data suggests that hyperbaric and even normobaric oxygen therapy can be effective if used appropriately, and raises the tantalizing possibility that hyperoxia can be used to extend the narrow therapeutic time window for stroke thrombolysis. This article reviews the history, rationale, mechanisms of action and adverse effects of hyperoxia, the key results of previous hyperoxia studies, and the potential role of oxygen therapy in contemporary stroke treatment.

AB  - Background: Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is a major cause of mortality in severe head injuries and pharmacologically induced cerebral vasoconstriction has been suggested as a possible treatment. In the present study a porcine model of increased ICP was utilized to study the changes in cerebral haemodynamics and energy metabolism induced by a selective 5-hydroxytryptaminei agonist (sumatriptan). Methods: ICP was raised by inflation of two balloons covering both parieto-occipital regions extradurally. The animals were randomized into four groups receiving sumatriptan: 0.01 mg·kg-1 (A), 0.03 mg·kg-1 (B), 0.1 mg·kg-1 (C), and 0.5 mg·kg-1 (D) intravenously over 10 min. Measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF), arterio-venous oxygen content difference (CavO2), and jugular venous pH (vpH) were performed 5, 20, 40, 60, and 75 min after start of the infusion. ICP, mean arterial pressure, and EEG were recorded continuously. Direct effects of sumatriptan were also compared in cortical arteries and veins in vitro. Results: Significant decreases in ICP were obtained in groups A, B, and C while group D exhibited a progressive increase in ICP. Significant reductions in CBF, increase in CavO2, and slowing of EEG were observed in groups B, C, and D. Sumatriptan caused moderate constriction of the arteries and a more pronounced dilatation of veins in vitro. Conclusion: The results indicate that a low dose of sumatriptan has the potential to reduce a raised ICP. High doses of sumatriptan cause a further increase of ICP possibly by dilatation of intracerebral veins.
