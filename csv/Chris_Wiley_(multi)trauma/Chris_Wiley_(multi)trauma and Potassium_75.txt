AB  - Summary This chapter outlines the specific pharmacology and techniques for the most commonly used opioid analgesic agents, which are also applied to anesthetic procedures. Opioid receptors are located in the nervous system and peripheral organs; therefore, their actions impact the brain, spinal cord, heart, lungs, gastrointestinal system, liver,musculoskeletal and reproductive organs. All mu-agonists are schedule N drugs (narcotics), for which records of administration must be kept due to the higher potential for abuse and dependence. Butorphanol is a mixed agonist-antagonist. Its kappa-agonistic actions confer analgesic and sedative effects as well, but it antagonizes the actions of mu-agonists if administered concomitantly. Hydrocodone is a mu opioid agonist that is available as oral combination preparations. There is limited data on the efficacy of hydrocodone in veterinary medicine experimentally or clinically, hence strong recommendations cannot be made to use oral hydrocodone for analgesia.

AB  - Abstract Background? Mycetoma is generally understood to be a chronic suppurative infection involving the skin and the underlying tissue. Mycetomas may be classified as those produced by true fungi (eumycetoma) versus those due to aerobic bacteria Actinomycetales (actinomycetoma). Methods? We report the atypical case of a mycetomatoid infection of the penile shaft and glans in a 36-year-old man, originally from Senegal, affected by Takayasu?s arteritis. Results? Extensive investigations excluded any other causative pathogen other than Candida albicans, and the ailment accordingly healed after fluconazole monotherapy. Conclusion? The authors discuss the unusual site of the disease and the singular clinical features related to the fungal etiology and put forward considerations on the pathogenic role of common microorganisms.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? We wish to report the case of a 5-year-old boy who had an interscalene catheter placed under ultrasound guidance. There is low level evidence to support the use of ultrasound when performing peripheral nerve blocks in adults and children. We will discuss the technique and an unusual complication with the catheter. Methods:? A 5-year-old, 20 kilogram, ASA I child was scheduled for a humeral osteotomy. Following induction of general anaesthesia an interscalene catheter was placed using both a nerve stimulator and ultrasound guidance. The catheter threaded easily and a dose of 7?ml 0.5% Ropivicaine was injected down the catheter, followed by another 3?ml at the end of surgery. Results:? The child had a successful sensory block and required only simple analgesia (oral paracetamol and ibuprofen) post-operatively. Of interest we were unable to elicit appropriate muscle twitches with the nerve stimulator despite good visualization of the brachial plexus and needle with the ultrasound. In addition, after a short period post-operatively we were unable to inject local anaesthetic down the catheter and it was subsequently removed. Following removal we found blood clot occluding all but one of the catheter side holes. Conclusions:? Ultrasound guidance was used to place an interscalene catheter in a 5-year-old?to date, the smallest child having this procedure in our hospital. Although the block was successful the catheter became occluded by clot. We have been unable to find other reports of this problem in the literature. Using ultrasound has the potential to reduce the risk of complications when placing interscalene catheters, particularly in children. Furthermore, this case illustrates that the use of a nerve stimulator may not guarantee adequate localization of the nerves during neural blockade.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? The mechanism of tourniquet-induced blood pressure increase is unknown. We determined the effect of bolus and continuous intravenously administered fentanyl on blood pressure and heart rate changes during in upper and lower limb surgeries under general anesthesia. Methods:? This study protocol was approved by the local ethical committee and was performed in a randomised and prospective fashion. Patients were divided into three groups: patients in GOP group (n?=?5) received no fentanyl throughout anaesthesia, patients in GOPF-B group (n?=?5) received bolus infusion of fentanyl 200?300?µg after tourniquet-induced blood pressure increase appeared apparently and in patients in AOPF-C group (n?=?5) received continuous infusion of fentanyl at the rate of 1?3?µg/kg/h to maintain the effect site concentration (Ce) of 1.5?2.0?ng/ml. Anesthesia was maintained with N2O 33% in oxygen or Air 50% in oxygen and propofol was target-controlled infused with Diprifusor at Ce of 2.5?3.5?µg/ml .Fentanyl Ce was simulated with Palmacokinetics developed by S.Uchida (National Cardiovascular Center). BIS was monitored in all patients and maintained at 40?60. Results:? In GOP group tourniquet-induced blood pressure increase appeared 45?60 minutes after the start of tourniquet inflation. In GOPF-B group, tourniquet-induced blood pressure increase was attenuated apparently after fentanyl was bolus administered. In GOPF-C group, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and BIS showed no statistically significant changes between 15 minutes and 90 minutes after the start of tourniquet inflation (P?<?0.05). Conclusions:? Both bolus and continuous intravenously administered fentanyl were effective to attenuate tourniquet-induced blood pressure increase. It is the first report of determining intravenously administered fentanyl, one of ?-opioids, was effective to attenuate tourniquet-induced blood pressure and heart rate increases under general anesthesia.

AB  - Figure?1 Outcomes following infusion at 4 weeks and 6 months?Group mean scores Purpose of the study:? A prospective before and after audit to assess the outcome following ketamine infusions for chronic pain at 4 weeks and 6 months following treatment. Methods:? After ethics committee approval data relating to demographics, pain scores and SF-36 Health surveys were collected pre, 4 weeks post and 6 months post infusion for all patients admitted for inpatient ketamine infusions over a 12-month period. All numerical data were analysed using Wilcoxon's Signed Ranks test. Differences were considered significant at P?<?0.05. Results:? ?? 14 patients (10 female, 4 male: median age 35 years, range 25?65 years). Low back pain (n?=?8), CRPS upper limb (n?=?2), CRPS lower limb (n?=?1), neck pain (n?=?1), shoulder pain (n?=?1), pelvic pain (n?=?1). ?? 14 patients were followed up at 4 weeks, one lost to follow-up at 6 months. ?? Median infusion duration of 6 days (range 3?10 days). ?? Maximum infusion rate?median of 20?mg/hour (range 12?32?mg/hour). ?? One infusion terminated due to dysphoric side effects. ?? VAS (visual analogue score)?decreased a median 63% (range 0?100%) or median 4/10 (95% CI 2/10?6/10) by the conclusion of the infusion. ?? Average weekly VAS prior to infusion had decreased by 20% (range 0?80%) or a median of 2.5/10 (95% CI 1/10?4/10) at 4 weeks post infusion. ?? Average VAS had decreased by a median 10% at 6 months (range 0?71%) which was not significant. Conclusions:? This small heterogeneous group of chronic pain patients demonstrated baseline SF-36 scores 1.5?2 standard deviations below the US population mean of 50 across all scales, indicating disabling global ill health. Ketamine infusions were generally well tolerated and produced significant reductions in reported pain scores by the end of treatment. Pain reduction had diminished by 4 weeks, however there remained a significant improvement in several scales particularly those relating to mental health. This raises the possibility that ketamine may exert a short to medium term anti-depressant effect. There was no significant improvement in any measure at 6 months.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? This study was designed to provide data on the efficacy, dose response, incidence and duration of adverse effects of flupirtine in the treatment of cancer-related neuropathic pain. Methods:? This was an 8-day, open label, dose escalation study of inpatients in a palliative care unit. After ethics committee approval, patients with moderate to severe neuropathic pain in spite of opioid treatment received an initial dose of flupirtine 100?mg four times daily (QID). This dose could be escalated by 100?mg QID every 2 days to a maximum of 300?mg QID. Efficacy measures included: 11 point scales measuring average pain and worst pain; a neuropathic pain discriminant score; 11 point scales for quality of life activities and a score of percentage pain relief (0?100%). Results:? Ten Patients were recruited into the study; only one patient was withdrawn because of side effects thought to be due to the flupirtine. There were significant reductions of average pain (p?=?0.0008), worst pain (p?=?0.0168) and neuropathic pain discriminant scores (p?<?0.0001; see figure). There were also significant improvements in the quality of life measures (p?=?0.0017), a reduction of adverse symptoms (p?=?0.0017) and an increase in percentage pain relief (p?=?0.0078). Additionally there occurred a statistically non-significant downward trend in opioid use. Eight patients elected to continue to take flupirtine after the trial, two taking 200?mg QID and the others 100?mg QID. Of these eight, six said that flupirtine was of considerable help and two said that it helped only a little. Conclusions:? Flupirtine is effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain caused by cancer when used in combination with opioids. This compound merits further investigation for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with other etiologies.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? To identify problems in the biopsychosocial model when applied to people in pain and to explore a resolution. Methods:? Critical analysis of the literature concerning the theory and application of biopsychosocial models to the practice of pain medicine Results:? The biopsychosocial model for understanding illness has generated the IASP definition of pain, two simpler conceptual frameworks, and three explanatory schemata for pain. However, in the absence of a theory of living systems that seeks to understand how the different domains of these schemata interact with each other, these attempts have been caught in circular argument and have been unable to transcend either biomedical reductionism or the perpetuation of body-mind dualism. In particular, the implication that pain is a ?thing? separate and distinct from the body not only bears little relationship to the lived experience of pain but also emphasises the inherent problem that arises when an observer attempts to reduce the experience of the pain of ?the other? to predictable parameters. Conclusions:? The self-referentiality of living systems (through their qualities of autopoiesis, non-centrality and negentropy) sees pain ?emerge? in unpredictable ways that defy any reduction of the lived experience to any particular ?thing.? Pain therefore constitutes an aporia,a space and presence that deny us access to its secrets. We suggest a project in which pain may be approached in the clinical encounter through the engagement of two autonomous self-referential beings from which new therapeutic possibilities can arise. We see three challenges to be met in this project: to accept that the pain of another person is irreducible to its neuronal correlates; to acknowledge all the principles which characterise autonomous biological systems; and to allow a rapprochement between the world of the clinician and the world of the person in pain.
