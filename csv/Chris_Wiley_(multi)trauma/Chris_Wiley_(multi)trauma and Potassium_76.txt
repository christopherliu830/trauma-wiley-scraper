AB  - Purpose of the study:? Endogenous opioid peptides such as methionine enkephalin (ME) and neuropeptides such as substance P (SP) are involved in modulating pain sensitive neurons. Recent studies have used human peripheral tissue such as dental pulp to investigate the effects whether inflammation and decay affect neuropeptide levels, this study investigates whether ME and SP levels are altered in inflamed human tooth pulp. Methods:? After Ethics Committee approval, ME and SP were extracted in 250?µl of 0.5M acetic acid from the tooth pulp of 8 patients: 4 with healthy pulps and 4 with inflamed pulps. We used liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC?MS) to detect changes in peptide concentration in the extracts. Peptide levels were compared to standard curves for each peptide, each sample was run in triplicate. Results:? Both ME (1.20?ng/µl) and SP (1.86?ng/µl) were present in healthy pulp, and the levels of both peptides were significantly increased in inflamed tissue (4.37?ng/µl) for ME and 6.90?ng/µl for SP (P?=?0.029 and P?<?0.001 for ME and SP respectively). Figure?1 illustrates the changes in peptide levels in inflammation compared to a healthy status. 1 Graph shows the concentration of ME and SP in both experimental groups (n?=?8). *Significant difference compared inflamed with control group (P?=?0.029 for ME and P?<?0.001 for SP). Conclusions:? Inflammation in teeth can lead to severe pain in patients. We have, for the first time, identified an elevation of an endogenous opioid in inflamed human teeth, providing further evidence for endogenous analgesic mechanisms that may be therapeutically manipulated.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? This study was designed to provide data on the efficacy, dose response, incidence and duration of adverse effects of flupirtine in the treatment of cancer-related neuropathic pain. Methods:? This was an 8-day, open label, dose escalation study of inpatients in a palliative care unit. After ethics committee approval, patients with moderate to severe neuropathic pain in spite of opioid treatment received an initial dose of flupirtine 100?mg four times daily (QID). This dose could be escalated by 100?mg QID every 2 days to a maximum of 300?mg QID. Efficacy measures included: 11 point scales measuring average pain and worst pain; a neuropathic pain discriminant score; 11 point scales for quality of life activities and a score of percentage pain relief (0?100%). Results:? Ten Patients were recruited into the study; only one patient was withdrawn because of side effects thought to be due to the flupirtine. There were significant reductions of average pain (p?=?0.0008), worst pain (p?=?0.0168) and neuropathic pain discriminant scores (p?<?0.0001; see figure). There were also significant improvements in the quality of life measures (p?=?0.0017), a reduction of adverse symptoms (p?=?0.0017) and an increase in percentage pain relief (p?=?0.0078). Additionally there occurred a statistically non-significant downward trend in opioid use. Eight patients elected to continue to take flupirtine after the trial, two taking 200?mg QID and the others 100?mg QID. Of these eight, six said that flupirtine was of considerable help and two said that it helped only a little. Conclusions:? Flupirtine is effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain caused by cancer when used in combination with opioids. This compound merits further investigation for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with other etiologies.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? To identify problems in the biopsychosocial model when applied to people in pain and to explore a resolution. Methods:? Critical analysis of the literature concerning the theory and application of biopsychosocial models to the practice of pain medicine Results:? The biopsychosocial model for understanding illness has generated the IASP definition of pain, two simpler conceptual frameworks, and three explanatory schemata for pain. However, in the absence of a theory of living systems that seeks to understand how the different domains of these schemata interact with each other, these attempts have been caught in circular argument and have been unable to transcend either biomedical reductionism or the perpetuation of body-mind dualism. In particular, the implication that pain is a ?thing? separate and distinct from the body not only bears little relationship to the lived experience of pain but also emphasises the inherent problem that arises when an observer attempts to reduce the experience of the pain of ?the other? to predictable parameters. Conclusions:? The self-referentiality of living systems (through their qualities of autopoiesis, non-centrality and negentropy) sees pain ?emerge? in unpredictable ways that defy any reduction of the lived experience to any particular ?thing.? Pain therefore constitutes an aporia,a space and presence that deny us access to its secrets. We suggest a project in which pain may be approached in the clinical encounter through the engagement of two autonomous self-referential beings from which new therapeutic possibilities can arise. We see three challenges to be met in this project: to accept that the pain of another person is irreducible to its neuronal correlates; to acknowledge all the principles which characterise autonomous biological systems; and to allow a rapprochement between the world of the clinician and the world of the person in pain.

AB  - Abstract. The need for cadaveric organs for transplantation is increasing. To decrease the shortage of organs, identification of potential donors and conditioning of these donors must improve. We present a review of relevant data on body and tissue alterations due to brain death and summarize the recent literature covering experimental and clinical studies on optimal donor management.

AB  - Summary The use of new techniques has allowed the assessment of body composition to emerge as a fundamental part of nutritional assessment in clinical populations, as distinct body tissues are associated with specific health outcomes. This chapter focuses on the imaging methods: bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and, more recently, computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US) imaging which are appear to be the most convenient for use in clinical practice. Imaging methods for the assessment of body composition include DXA, CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and US, and three-dimensional (3D) (photonic) imaging. With the exception of US and 3D imaging, imaging techniques are now considered to be the most accurate tools for measuring adipose tissue and organs in clinical research. The use of these techniques has revolutionised the capacity to assess body composition and aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of a multitude of disease states and treatment regimes.

AB  - Abstract A liquid collagen has been developed that fibrilizes upon injection. Rapid polymerizing collagen (RPC) is a type I porcine collagen that undergoes fibrillization upon interaction with ionic solutions, such as physiological solutions. The ability to inject liquid collagen would be beneficial for many soft tissue augmentation applications. In this study, RPC was synthesized and characterized as a possible dermal filler. Transmission electron microscopy, ion induced RPC fibrillogenesis tests, collagenase resistance assay, and injection force studies were performed to assess RPC's physicochemical properties. An in vivo study was performed which consisted of a 1-, 3-, and 6-month study where RPC was injected into the ears of miniature swine. The results demonstrated that the liquid RPC requires low injection force (<7 N); fibrillogenesis and banding of collagen occurs when RPC is injected into ionic solutions, and RPC has enhanced resistance to collagenase breakdown. The in vivo study demonstrated long-term biocompatibility with low irritation scores. In conclusion RPC possesses many of the desirable properties of a soft tissue augmentation material. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part A: 104A: 758?767, 2016.
