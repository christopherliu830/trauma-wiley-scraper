AB  - Abstract Background: Epistaxis is the most common manifestation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), affecting approximately 90% of patients at some point during their lifetime. Bleeding is chronic and varies from mild, self-limited episodes to severe, transfusion-dependent or life-threatening epistaxis. Treatment options vary from conservative, nonsurgical management to more aggressive surgical approaches. A number of treatment options have been introduced in recent years. There is little consensus in the literature regarding treatment algorithms. The objective of this investigation was to provide a contemporary review of HHT-related epistaxis, including pathophysiology, disease manifestations, and state-of-the-art treatment modalities. Methods: A systematic review of the literature for HHT-related epistaxis was performed using the search terms ?hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia? and ?epistaxis.? Additional literature search regarding current recommendations for HHT evaluation and recent developments in genetic mechanisms, pathophysiology, and treatment of HHT was also performed. Results: A total of 308 articles were identified and reviewed for appropriateness of inclusion whereas 64 articles met inclusion criteria. Treatment options range from topical and hormonal therapy to more aggressive surgical modalities. Most treatment descriptions are case series, with few randomized controlled trials. A number of new and novel therapies have been introduced in recent years. Conclusion: HHT is a heterogeneous disease requiring multidisciplinary evaluation and treatment. Therapeutic options for HHT-related epistaxis vary from conservative, nonsurgical measures to more aggressive surgical treatments. A graduated treatment plan is recommended. Patients present with a wide degree in variation of severity of epistaxis, and treatment is best tailored to the individual patient. ?2012 ARSAAOA, LLC.

AB  - Summary All currently recognized neurological diseases are believed to be associated with some degree of neuroinflammation. Indeed, patient postmortem examinations almost always reveal enhanced expression of highly activated immunocompetent microglia within degenerating brain regions, often together with astrocyte and pro-inflammatory cytokine (neuro-immune signaling glycoproteins) accumulation. Paralleling these human studies, data from various genetic and toxin-based animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (AD and PD, respectively), have likewise demonstrated a prominent cytokine-microglial inflammatory component. Such preclinical work has been critical in moving the discussion surrounding the significance of neuroinflammation in degenerative brain diseases from correlation to causation. Hence, the potential of anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory agents to mitigate neurodegeneration in AD and PD deserves serious attention. That said, there is a growing consensus that neuroinflammation may be best viewed as a ?double-edged sword?, with the capacity to influence both positive and negative outcomes. A better understanding of the factors that modulate neuroinflammatory processes is therefore critical for developing optimal strategies for therapeutically manipulating neuro-immune responses in AD and PD.

AB  - Abstract Bacteria have been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of pulp and periapical diseases. The primary aim of endodontic treatment is to remove as many bacteria as possible from the root canal system and then to create an environment in which any remaining organisms cannot survive. This can only be achieved through the use of a combination of aseptic treatment techniques, chemomechanical preparation of the root canal, antimicrobial irrigating solutions and intracanal medicaments. The choice of which intracanal medicament to use is dependent on having an accurate diagnosis of the condition being treated, as well as a thorough knowledge of the type of organisms likely to be involved and their mechanisms of growth and survival. Since the disease is likely to have been caused by the presence of bacteria within the root canal, the use of an antimicrobial agent is essential. Many medicaments have been used in an attempt to achieve the above aims but no single preparation has been found to be completely predictable or effective. Commonly used medicaments include calcium hydroxide, antibiotics, non-phenolic biocides, phenolic biocides and iodine compounds. Each has advantages and disadvantages, and further research is required to determine which is best suited for root canal infections.

AB  - Abstract Vasomotion refers to spontaneous oscillation of small vessels observed in many microvascular beds. It is an intrinsic phenomenon unrelated to cardiac rhythm or neural and hormonal regulation. Vasomotion is found to be particularly prominent under conditions of metabolic stress. In spite of a significant existent literature on vasomotion, its physiological and pathophysiological roles are not clear. It is thought that modulation of vasomotion by vasoactive substances released by metabolizing tissue plays a role in ensuring optimal delivery of nutrients to the tissue. Vasomotion rhythms exhibit a great variety of temporal patterns from regular oscillations to chaos. The nature of vasomotion rhythm is believed to be significant to its function, with chaotic vasomotion offering several physiological advantages over regular, periodic vasomotion. In this article, we emphasize that vasomotion is best understood as a network phenomenon. When there is a local metabolic demand in tissue, an ideal vascular response should extend beyond local microvasculature, with coordinated changes over multiple vascular segments. Mechanisms of information transfer over a vessel network have been discussed in the literature. The microvascular system may be regarded as a network of dynamic elements, interacting, either over the vascular anatomical network via gap junctions, or physiologically by exchange of vasoactive substances. Drawing analogies with spatiotemporal patterns in neuronal networks of central nervous system, we ask if properties like synchronization/desynchronization of vasomotors have special significance to microcirculation. Thus the contemporary literature throws up a novel view of microcirculation as a network that exhibits complex, spatiotemporal and informational dynamics.
