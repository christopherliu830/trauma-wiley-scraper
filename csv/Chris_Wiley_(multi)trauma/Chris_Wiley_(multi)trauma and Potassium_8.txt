AB  - Objective To describe clinical use of computed tomography (CT) and hoof surface markers to facilitate internal fixation within the confines of the hoof wall. Study Design Retrospective case series. Animals Horses (n?=?16) that had CT-guided internal fixation of the distal phalanx (DP) or distal sesamoid bone (DSB). Methods Drill bit entry point and direction were planned from CT image series performed on hooves with grids of barium paste dots at proposed entry and projected exit sites. Post-implantation CT images were obtained to check screw position and length as well as fracture reduction. Imaging, reduction, and surgical and general anesthesia times were evaluated. Outcome was recorded. Results Screw position and length were considered near optimal in all horses, with no consequential malposition of bits or screws. Fracture reduction was evident in all cases. Preoperative planning times (at least 2 CT image acquisitions and grid creation) ranged from 10 to 20?minutes. Surgery time ranged from 45 to 90?minutes (mean, 61?minutes) and general anesthesia time ranged from 115 to 220?minutes (mean, 171?minutes). Conclusions The combination of CT and surface marker grids allowed accurate positioning of screws in clinical DP and DSB fractures. The technique was simple and rapid. An aiming device is useful for the technique.

AB  - Summary Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in around10-20%of patients admitted to hospital, and is most often due to hypovolaemia/hypotension, sepsis and nephrotoxins. This chapter summarizes stage-based management of AKI. It also summarizes monitoring and supportive care in AKI. Three common scenarios are encountered: corrected hypovolaemia/hypotension, with improving renal function; persisting/worsening AKI despite correction of hypovolaemia/hypotension and removal of nephrotoxins; and suspected urinary tract obstruction. Prompt and vigorous correction of hypovolaemia and hypotension will often reverse AKI. If there is clinically obvious hypovolaemia, IV fluid is given. Treatment of the trigger of deterioration and avoidance of hypovolaemia (preferably by albumin administration) can help to decrease the incidence of AKI. A CVP line may be helpful (to avoid over-replacement of fluid), but the patient should be resuscitated first before this is placed. Ultrasonography of the inferior vena cava is one of the methods to assess the CVP.

AB  - Objective To report long-term outcome in a mare that had extensive rostral mandibulectomy to remove an ameloblastoma. Study Design Clinical report. Animals A 21-year-old mare. Methods An ameloblastoma, located in the rostral aspect of the mandible, was removed by complete en-bloc resection of the tumor, removing most of the mandibular symphysis. Results The day after surgery, the remaining mandibular symphysis (<5?mm) fractured causing marked instability of the hemi-mandibles. Partial wound dehiscence occurred 5 days after surgery; however, the mare was able to eat well and the incision healed within 2 weeks. At 18 months, there was bony fusion of the hemi-mandibles and mild protrusion of the tongue. Conclusion Extensive rostral mandibulectomy (up to the caudal edge of the mandibular symphysis) can apparently be performed in a horse without internal or external stabilization, and yield a cosmetic and functional outcome.

AB  - Synopsis Bacillus cereus is ubiquitous in nature and thus occurs naturally in a wide range of raw materials and foodstuffs. B. cereus spores are resistant to desiccation and heat and able to survive dry storage and cooking. Vegetative cells produce several toxins which on ingestion in sufficient numbers can cause vomiting and/or diarrhoea depending on the toxins produced. Gastrointestinal disease is commonly associated with reheated or inadequately cooked foods. In addition to being a rare cause of several acute infections (e.g. pneumonia and septicaemia), B. cereus can also cause localized infection of post-surgical or trauma wounds and is a rare but significant pathogen of the eye where it may result in severe endophthalmitis often leading to loss of vision. Key risk factors in such cases are trauma to the eye and retained contaminated intraocular foreign bodies. In addition, rare cases of B. cereus-associated keratitis (inflammation of the cornea) have been linked to contact lens use. Bacillus cereus is therefore a microbial contaminant that could adversely affect product safety of cosmetic and facial toiletries and pose a threat to the user if other key risk factors are also present. The infective dose in the human eye is unknown, but as few as 100 cfu has been reported to initiate infection in a susceptible animal model. However, we are not aware of any reports in the literature of B. cereus infections in any body site linked with use of personal care products. Low levels of B. cereus spores may on occasion be present in near-eye cosmetics, and these products have been used by consumers for many years. In addition, exposure to B. cereus is more likely to occur through other routes (e.g. dustborne contamination) due to its ubiquity and resistance properties of spores. The organism has been recovered from the eyes of healthy individuals. Therefore, although there may be a perceived hazard, the risk of severe eye infections as a consequence of exposure through contaminated near-eye cosmetics is judged to be vanishingly small. It is unlikely that more stringent microbiological standards for near-eye cosmetics will have any impact on the risk of severe eye infections caused by B. cereus, as these are not linked to use of personal care products.

AB  - Aims Evaluation and management of patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the intensive care unit (ICU) are difficult. The use of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a quantitative marker of cardiac stress and heart failure (HF), may be helpful. The purpose of this study is to describe the prevalence of causative disorders of hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the ICU and to determine the impact of a BNP-guided diagnostic strategy. Methods and results This prospective, multi-centre, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial included 314 ICU patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure: 159 patients were randomly assigned to a diagnostic strategy involving the measurement of BNP and 155 were assessed in a standard manner. The time to discharge and the total cost of treatment were the primary endpoints. Hypoxaemic respiratory failure was multi-causal in 27% of the patients. Heart failure was the most common diagnosis in both groups. The use of BNP levels, in conjunction with other clinical information, significantly increased the detection of HF in combination with an additional diagnosis (32 vs. 16%, P = 0.001) and also increased the application of HF-specific medical therapy (nitrates: 32 vs. 23%, P < 0.05 and diuretics: 65 vs. 50%, P < 0.01). Time to discharge (median, 13 vs.14 days, P = 0.50) and total cost of treatment (median, US-$6190 vs. 7155, P = 0.24) were comparable in both groups. Conclusion Hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the ICU is often a multi-causal disorder. The use of BNP increased the detection of HF, but did not significantly improve patient management as quantified by time to discharge or treatment cost. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00130559.

AB  - Key points The physiological metabolite, lactate and the two-pore domain leak potassium channel, TREK1 are known neuroprotectants against cerebral ischaemia. However, it is not known whether lactate interacts with TREK1 channel to provide neuroprotection. In this study we show that lactate increases TREK1 channel activity and hyperpolarizes CA1 stratum radiatum astrocytes in hippocampal slices. Lactate increases open probability and decreases longer close time of the human (h)TREK1 channel in a concentration dependent manner. Lactate interacts with histidine 328 (H328) in the carboxy terminal domain of hTREK1 channel to decrease its dwell time in the longer closed state. This interaction was dependent on the charge on H328. Lactate-insensitive mutant H328A hTREK1 showed pH sensitivity similar to wild-type hTREK1, indicating that the effect of lactate on hTREK1 is independent of pH change. Abstract A rise in lactate concentration and the leak potassium channel TREK1 have been independently associated with cerebral ischaemia. Recent literature suggests lactate to be neuroprotective and TREK1 knockout mice show an increased sensitivity to brain and spinal cord ischaemia; however, the connecting link between the two is missing. Therefore we hypothesized that lactate might interact with TREK1 channels. In the present study, we show that lactate at ischaemic concentrations (15?30 mm) at pH 7.4 increases TREK1 current in CA1 stratum radiatum astrocytes and causes membrane hyperpolarization. We confirm the intracellular action of lactate on TREK1 in hippocampal slices using monocarboxylate transporter blockers and at single channel level in cell-free inside-out membrane patches. The intracellular effect of lactate on TREK1 is specific since other monocarboxylates such as pyruvate and acetate at pH 7.4 failed to increase TREK1 current. Deletion and point mutation experiments suggest that lactate decreases the longer close dwell time incrementally with increase in lactate concentration by interacting with the histidine residue at position 328 (H328) in the carboxy terminal domain of the TREK1 channel. The interaction of lactate with H328 is dependent on the charge on the histidine residue since isosteric mutation of H328 to glutamine did not show an increase in TREK1 channel activity with lactate. This is the first demonstration of a direct effect of lactate on ion channel activity. The action of lactate on the TREK1 channel signifies a separate neuroprotective mechanism in ischaemia since it was found to be independent of the effect of acidic pH on channel activity.

AB  - The radiotracer, [18F]-THK-5351, is a highly selective and high-binding affinity PET imaging agent for aggregates of hyper-phosphorylated tau protein. Our report is a simplified 1-pot, 2-step radiosynthesis of [18F]-THK-5351. This report is broadly applicable for routine clinical production and multi-center trials on account of favorable half-life of flourine-18 and the use of a commercially available radiosynthesis module, the GE TRACERlab? FXFN. First, the O-THP protected tosyl precursor underwent nucleophilic fluorinating reaction with potassium cryptand fluoride ([18F] fluoride (K[18F]/K222)) in Dimethyl sulfoxide at 110°C for 10 minutes followed by O-THP removal by using diluted hydrochloric acid (HCl) at same temperature. [18F]-THK-5351 was purified via semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography and formulated by using 10% EtOH, United States Pharmacopeia (USP) in 0.9% sodium chloride for injection, USP and an uncorrected radiochemical yield of 21 ± 3.5%, with a specific activity of 153.11 ± 25.9 GBq/?mol (4138 ± 700 mCi/?mol) at the end of synthesis (63 minutes; n = 3).

AB  - Summary Veterinary technicians play an important role in preoperative planning by performing tests and providing the veterinary surgeon and anesthesia staff with the results. They also follow the veterinarian's orders by calculating medication dosage, filling prescriptions, and administering medications. Preoperative tests include complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry panel, and urinalysis. A database of a packed cell volume (PCV), total protein and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and blood glucose via a glucometer provides the minimal information required prior to surgery. In addition to the common blood and urine tests, a variety of conditions benefit from preoperative sampling. These include fine needle aspirates (FNA) of joints, abdomen, pulmonary spaces, masses, cysts, and abscesses for cytologic exam. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative imaging - radiographs, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast studies, and ultrasound - aid in diagnosis, surgical planning, and evaluation. Individual and combined modalities provide the surgeon and veterinary technician with specific information.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report outcomes and risk factors for mortality in dogs that underwent surgical management of lung lobe torsion. Study design Retrospective case series from 5 veterinary teaching hospitals (2005?2017). Animals Fifty dogs with 52 instances of lung lobe torsion. Methods Data collected from medical records included signalment, clinical findings, results of clinicopathologic testing and diagnostic imaging, surgical treatment, lung lobe affected, intraoperative and postoperative complications, histopathologic and microbiologic findings, and outcome. Follow-up was obtained from medical records and telephone contact with primary care veterinarians. Results Fifty-two instances of lung lobe torsion were identified in 50 dogs, with a median follow-up of 453?days (range, 0?3075). Forty-six (92%) dogs survived to discharge. Dogs with concurrent torsion of the right cranial and middle lung lobes were less likely to survive (2/4) than those with torsion of the left cranial lung lobe (22/22). No other risk factors for mortality prior to hospital discharge were identified. Overall median survival time after hospital discharge was 1369?days. Four dogs had >1 episode of lung lobe torsion. Conclusion The percentage of dogs surviving to discharge after surgical treatment of lung lobe torsion was higher than previously reported. The short- and long-term prognosis was excellent with surgical treatment of lung lobe torsion. Clinical significance Surgery should be recommended when lung lobe torsion is suspected because of the high survival to discharge rate and excellent long-term prognosis.

AB  - Norepinephrine release from spinal synaptosomes. (Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC) Anesthesiology 2000;93:164?172. The purpose of this study was to determine if clonidine could inhibit release of NE in a preparation of spinal cord tissue lacking synaptic circuits. Crude synaptosomes were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rat spinal cord, loaded with [3H]NE, and stimulated by potassium chloride to release [3H]NE. Samples were incubated with clonidine in the absence or presence of various inhibitors. To study the effect of α2A-adrenergic receptor subtypes, some animals were pretreated with an oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) composed of a sense or antisense sequence to a portion of this receptor. Potassium chloride produced a concentration-dependent increase in [3H]NE release, and this release was inhibited by clonidine with a concentration producing 50% maximal inhibition (IC50) of 1.3 ?m. The effect of clonidine was inhibited by the α2A-adrenergic antagonists, yohimbine, and idazoxan, but not by α1A-adrenergic, muscarinic, or opioid antagonists. Intrathecal pretreatment with antisense ODN to α2A-adrenergic receptors reduced α2A-adrenergic receptor protein expression compared with sense ODN control and also reduced clonidine-induced inhibition of [3H]NE release. Conclude that these data demonstrate the existence of classic autoinhibitory α2A-adrenergic receptors in the spinal cord, probably of the α2A subtype. They further suggest that clonidine-induced stimulation of spinal NE release must occur from indirect actions, presumably due to activation of a spinal circuit.
