AB  - Abstract Vasomotion refers to spontaneous oscillation of small vessels observed in many microvascular beds. It is an intrinsic phenomenon unrelated to cardiac rhythm or neural and hormonal regulation. Vasomotion is found to be particularly prominent under conditions of metabolic stress. In spite of a significant existent literature on vasomotion, its physiological and pathophysiological roles are not clear. It is thought that modulation of vasomotion by vasoactive substances released by metabolizing tissue plays a role in ensuring optimal delivery of nutrients to the tissue. Vasomotion rhythms exhibit a great variety of temporal patterns from regular oscillations to chaos. The nature of vasomotion rhythm is believed to be significant to its function, with chaotic vasomotion offering several physiological advantages over regular, periodic vasomotion. In this article, we emphasize that vasomotion is best understood as a network phenomenon. When there is a local metabolic demand in tissue, an ideal vascular response should extend beyond local microvasculature, with coordinated changes over multiple vascular segments. Mechanisms of information transfer over a vessel network have been discussed in the literature. The microvascular system may be regarded as a network of dynamic elements, interacting, either over the vascular anatomical network via gap junctions, or physiologically by exchange of vasoactive substances. Drawing analogies with spatiotemporal patterns in neuronal networks of central nervous system, we ask if properties like synchronization/desynchronization of vasomotors have special significance to microcirculation. Thus the contemporary literature throws up a novel view of microcirculation as a network that exhibits complex, spatiotemporal and informational dynamics.

AB  - 1. The present study has investigated the reflex organization of sympathetic neurones and its control of autonomic effector organs following nerve injury and repair. A well-defined population of vasoconstrictor neurones supplying blood vessels of the hairy skin was forced to innervate a territory that contained some appropriate, but mainly inappropriate autonomic effector organs. For this purpose the central stump of the cut sural nerve was sutured to the peripheral stump of the cut tibial nerve 11-12 months prior to the terminal experiment. 2. The activity of postganglionic sympathetic neurones was recorded from fine strands of the sural nerve proximal to the nerve lesion. Using a laser-Doppler device cutaneous blood flow was measured in the hairless skin of the hindpaw that was now reinnervated by the sural nerve. The results show a qualitative change of the reflex organization of sympathetic neurones following cross-union of these nerves. 3. Stimulation of arterial chemoreceptors by ventilating the animals with a hypoxic gas mixture (8% O2 in N2 for 3-8 min) increased the activity in twelve out of thirteen strands containing postganglionic sympathetic fibres. The increase of sympathetic activity contrasts with results from normal animals where systemic hypoxia causes a reflex decrease of activity in postganglionic fibres of the sural nerve. 4. Reflex changes of sympathetic activity were closely followed by corresponding changes of cutaneous blood flow. Systemic hypoxia produced vasoconstriction in operated animals in contrast to the vasodilatation observed in normal animals. 5. We conclude that the reflex organization of sympathetic neurones can change qualitatively following nerve lesion when sympathetic neurones regenerate and supply inappropriate target tissues. This long-lasting change reflects the plasticity of the autonomic nervous system and can produce a sustained abnormal control of reinnervated autonomic effector organs.

AB  - Abstract Electroanalysis involves the measurement or determination of a chemical or biochemical species, using a wide range of electrochemical methods. The species being measured can either bring about a direct electrochemical response that can be detected and measured, or can be induced to bring about such a response, resulting in a process that can be detected electrochemically. In both cases an interface is required between the chemical or biochemical species being measured, and the electrochemical system performing the measurement. This interface is referred to as an ?electrode?. It is the transfer of electrons or ions between the electrode and the environment being sampled which is of concern in electroanalysis. The application of electrochemistry in clinical analysis is concerned with the measurement of chemical and biochemical species present in biological fluids (primarily blood but also urine and other body fluids and tissues). It is applied in several areas of critical care where its rapidity, sensitivity, precision, and accuracy at biologically relevant concentrations make it an ideal choice over other, typically slower, biochemical techniques. Indeed, it is the speed of electrochemical analysis that principally differentiates it from other methods. It is not universally applicable to clinical chemistry, however, and has only been applied in situations where such analyses are relevant. This has principally been in the analysis of blood gases and pH and blood electrolytes. Electrochemical methods are, however, gradually being extended to the analysis of small biochemical components such as sugars, amino acids and other metabolites, with the advent of enzyme-based ?biosensors?. There is also little doubt that the application of electrochemistry in clinical analysis will be further exploited by the use of such biosensor devices based on other forms of biorecognition, such as antibodies, cell ligands, membranes, tissues and whole cells. These biosensor devices are also amenable to other forms of detection such as acoustic wave and optical measurements. Together, these techniques offer a wide range of advantages over traditional analytical methodologies, and will undoubtedly have a rapidly increasing impact on many types of clinical analysis. This article focuses on the use of electrochemical techniques and electrochemical biosensors and their application in clinical chemistry.
