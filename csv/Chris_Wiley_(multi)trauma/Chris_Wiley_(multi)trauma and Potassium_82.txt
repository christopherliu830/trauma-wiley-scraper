AB  - Summary This book is focused on the assessment of a stroke patient linking the neurological findings with the evaluation of vessels, and on integration of these findings with parenchymal and perfusion imaging. The neurological symptom onset was long equated with the timing of a thromboembolic occlusion. In reality, it is not. Symptom onset is the time of the collateral or residual flow depletion to a level causing the neuronal dysfunction. Structured case-based problem solving is provided to illustrate how to approach typical patient problems, what key questions we ask to begin patient management, and the complimentary use of diverse ultrasound tests to the neurological examination and the standard or care CT or MRI scanning across different pathogenic mechanisms. Early determination of the stroke mechanism is the key to treatment selection.

AB  - Abstract Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP), which is caused by human papillomavirus types 6 and 11, is the most common benign neoplasm of the larynx among children and the second most frequent cause of childhood hoarseness. After changes in voice, stridor is the second most common symptom, first inspiratory and then biphasic. Less common presenting symptoms include chronic cough, recurrent pneumonia, failure to thrive, dyspnea, dysphagia, or acute respiratory distress, especially in infants with an upper respiratory tract infection. Differential diagnoses include asthma, croup, allergies, vocal nodules, or bronchitis. Reports estimate the incidence of RRP in the United States at 4.3 per 100,000 children and 1.8 per 100,000 adults. Infection in children has been associated with vertical transmission during vaginal delivery from an infected mother. Younger age at diagnosis is associated with more aggressive disease and the need for more frequent surgical procedures to decrease the airway burden. When surgical therapy is needed more frequently than four times in 12 months or there is evidence of RRP outside the larynx, adjuvant medical therapy should be considered. Adjuvant therapies that have been investigated include dietary supplements, control of extra-esophageal reflux disease, potent antiviral and chemotherapeutic agents, and photodynamic therapies; although several have shown promise, none to date has ?cured? RRP, and some may have serious side effects. Because RRP, although histologicallybenign, is so difficult to control and can cause severe morbidity and death, better therapies are needed. The potential for a quadrivalent human papilloma vaccine is being explored to reduce the incidence of this disease.

AB  - Abstract The emergence of high-performance materials for flexible inorganic light emitting diodes (ILEDs) provides the foundations for a broad range of compelling, unconventional systems, from deformable displays and lighting sources to wearable and implantable bioelectronics with diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. Interdisciplinary progress in materials synthetic methods, device designs, mechanical layouts, and assembly techniques over the past decade enables flexible ILEDs with remarkable operating characteristics even under extreme modes of mechanical deformation. This review summarizes recent advances in this field, with emphasis on the unique properties of the underlying materials and device physics in the first several sections. The subsequent content highlights examples of system-level integration of flexible ILEDs into advanced optoelectronic platforms with characteristics that would be difficult or impossible to achieve with conventional approaches. Miniaturized, implantable biomedical tools for optical modulation of neural activity at target sites and conformable, skin-mounted electronics for sensing and visualization of physiological parameters in real time provide examples of some of the most recent directions.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on CAM treatments supported by scientific evidence for mechanisms of action, clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy, and observations of benefit from the authors' clinical experience. There is limited data in some case, but this should not deter physicians from considering these substances when appropriate. There are six sections in the chapter: (1) Mood disorders; (2) Anxiety and stress-related disorders; (3) Substance abuse; (4) Hormone-related disorders; (5) Disorders of attention, memory, and cognition; and (6) Issues of quality control, product variability, side effects, drug interactions, and legal-ethical issues.
