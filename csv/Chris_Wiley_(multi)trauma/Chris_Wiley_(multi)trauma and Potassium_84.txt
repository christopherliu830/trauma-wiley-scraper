AB  - Migraine is a complex, debilitating neurovascular disorder, typically characterized by recurring, incapacitating attacks of severe headache often accompanied by nausea and neurological disturbances. It has a strong genetic basis demonstrated by rare migraine disorders caused by mutations in single genes (monogenic), as well as familial clustering of common migraine which is associated with polymorphisms in many genes (polygenic). Hemiplegic migraine is a dominantly inherited, severe form of migraine with associated motor weakness. Family studies have found that mutations in three different ion channels genes, CACNA1A, ATP1A2, and SCN1A can be causal. Functional studies of these mutations has shown that they can result in defective regulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission and the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the brain, which lowers the threshold for cortical spreading depression, a wave of cortical depolarization thought to be involved in headache initiation mechanisms. Other putative genes for monogenic migraine include KCKN18, PRRT2, and CSNK1D, which can also be involved with other disorders. There are a number of primarily vascular disorders caused by mutations in single genes, which are often accompanied by migraine symptoms. Mutations in NOTCH3 causes cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), a hereditary cerebrovascular disease that leads to ischemic strokes and dementia, but in which migraine is often present, sometimes long before the onset of other symptoms. Mutations in the TREX1 and COL4A1 also cause vascular disorders, but often feature migraine. With respect to common polygenic migraine, genome-wide association studies have now identified single nucleotide polymorphisms at 38 loci significantly associated with migraine risk. Functions assigned to the genes in proximity to these loci suggest that both neuronal and vascular pathways also contribute to the pathophysiology of common migraine. Further studies are required to fully understand these findings and translate them into treatment options for migraine patients.

AB  - Abstract Good electrode design is not as simple and straightforward a matter as is often assumed, and all electrode designs are not equal in performance for a given application. One must therefore not simply choose an electrode with as conductive a metal plate as possible. Different materials and designs are required for different applications, and it is often best to start with the design of the electrode when developing a new monitoring or stimulation system, rather than leaving it to the end of the project. Key aspects of biomedical electrode design and performance are reviewed. Historical developments are briefly presented, as many of the early designs are still being used, albeit sometimes in different areas of monitoring or therapy. Ideas for electrode design can also be gleaned from the present state-of-the-art other branches of monitoring or electrotherapy.

AB  - There is no doubt that seizures change processes in neuronal networks which themselves impact on seizure susceptibility, and reports on such changes probably account for the majority of studies in experimental epileptology. As much as there is no doubt about this general fact, there is, to date, quite some disagreement on whether such changes are pro-epileptic, anti-epileptic, or both, and which are crucial and which are less so. While it is not possible to provide a general answer to this, this review attempts to categorise and highlight some of these findings, and relate them to specific ontogenetic or pathophysiological conditions. Data from studies of animal models (nearly exclusively) is presented, with a focus on two main aspects: ontogenetic particularities and pathophysiological conditions, supporting evidence of susceptibility and seizure termination mechanisms in adult animal models.
