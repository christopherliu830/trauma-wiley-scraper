AB  - Summary Medical progress has made organ transplantation an accepted therapeutic modality for treating a variety of diseases affecting various organ systems in infants and children. Improvements in immunosuppressive therapy, surgical techniques, and organ preservation have permitted utilization of transplantation in a greater number of patients, and pediatric patients in particular have benefited from the growth of transplantation. Anesthetic management of these procedures requires understanding the physiological implications of organ failure, as well as specific requirements of the transplant procedure. To facilitate this discussion, issues related to the anesthetic care of children undergoing liver, renal, heart, heart-lung, lung, and multivisceral transplantation will be discussed separately.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the anesthetic management of a dog undergoing caudal vena cava (CVC) occlusion during adrenalectomy, and to discuss a reflex bradycardia that was observed during the procedure. Case Summary General anesthesia of a 10-year-old Rhodesian ridgeback for excision of an adrenal mass and associated CVC tumor thrombus was performed. The dog was premedicated with IV methadone and anesthesia was induced with IV alfaxalone and maintained with isoflurane in 100% oxygen. An IV remifentanil infusion was administered for intraoperative analgesia. Surgical removal of the thrombus necessitated temporary complete occlusion of the CVC. During CVC occlusion an acute paradoxical bradycardia occurred, which was successfully treated with IV atropine. The cardiovascular change resembled a Bezold?Jarisch or reverse Bainbridge reflex, and was believed to be mediated by cardiac mechanoreceptors following the sudden decrease in preload. Increased myocardial contractility subsequent to increased sympathetic nervous system activity may also have contributed. A decrease in urine output was observed following CVC occlusion but had returned to normal 2 hours following the end of anesthesia. Recovery from anesthesia was otherwise uneventful. New or unique information provided Although the mechanism is unclear, a paradoxical bradycardia may occur during complete CVC occlusion in the dog. Factors that increase sympathetic nervous system outflow, such as administration of dopamine, may have contributed to the occurrence of the reflex.

AB  - Abstract Elizabethkingia meningoseptica is an unusual, highly resistant, gram- negative bacillus. While E. meningoseptica?associated meningitis outbreaks have been well-documented in hospital neonatal wards and among immunocompromised adults, reports describing this microorganism in critically ill children are scarce. The purpose of this report was to describe a case of a 3 year-old girl who developed pneumonia caused by E. meningoseptica in the setting of previous use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and to review the pediatric literature regarding this pathogen.

AB  - The article presents studies performed before, during and after a marathon run (42 195 m) in a 32-year-old man who underwent a bilateral lung transplantation because of end-stage cystic fibrosis (CF) 15 months prior to the race. Before the run his FEV1 was 81% predicted, compared with 19% predicted before the operation, and his maximal oxygen uptake was 31.9 ml/kg?1/min?1. He completed the New York City Marathon 1998 without major problems in 7 h 8 min 50s. Pulmonary tests, biochemical changes and endocrine responses indicated transient changes, mostly as expected in healthy marathon runners. The case demonstrates that physiological trainability and psychological will power following a successful bilateral lung transplantation can transform a chronically ill CF patient into a robust marathon runner.

AB  - Abstract Inflammasomes are signalling platforms that sense a diverse range of microbial products and also a number of stress and damage associated endogenous signals. Inflammasome complexes can be formed by members of the Nod-like receptor family or the PYHIN family member AIM2. Upon formation, inflammasomes trigger proteolysis of caspase-1, which subsequently leads to a potent inflammatory response through the maturation and secretion of IL-1 family cytokines, which can be accompanied by an inflammatory cell death termed pyroptosis. Here, we review the sensing mechanisms of the currently characterized inflammasome complexes and discuss how they are involved in the innate immune response against microbial pathogens. We especially highlight recent advances in the molecular understanding of how microbial patterns are detected and discriminated from endogenous compounds by inflammasome sensors. Further, we review how inflammasomes contribute to the anti microbial host defense by cytokine-dependent and cell autonomous mechanisms. This review is part of the review series on host-pathogen interactions. See more reviews from this series..

AB  - Abstract Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA is a neuronopathic lysosomal storage disease, characterised by heparan sulphate and other substrates accumulating in the brain. Patients develop behavioural disturbances and cognitive decline, a possible consequence of neuroinflammation and abnormal substrate accumulation. Interleukin (IL)-1? and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) expression were significantly increased in both murine models and human MPSIII patients. We identified pathogenic mechanisms of inflammasome activation, including that disease-specific 2-O-sulphated heparan sulphate was essential for priming an IL-1? response via the Toll-like receptor 4 complex. However, mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA primary and secondary storage substrates, such as amyloid beta, were both required to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and initiate IL-1? secretion. IL-1 blockade in mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA mice using IL-1 receptor type 1 knockout or haematopoietic stem cell gene therapy over-expressing IL-1Ra reduced gliosis and completely prevented behavioural phenotypes. In conclusion, we demonstrate that IL-1 drives neuroinflammation, behavioural abnormality and cognitive decline in mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA, highlighting haematopoietic stem cell gene therapy treatment with IL-1Ra as a potential neuronopathic lysosomal disease treatment.

AB  - ABSTRACT The most common forms of dystonia are those that develop in adults and affect a relatively isolated region of the body. Although these adult-onset focal dystonias are most prevalent, knowledge of their etiologies and pathogenesis has lagged behind some of the rarer generalized dystonias, in which the identification of genetic defects has facilitated both basic and clinical research. This summary provides a brief review of the clinical manifestations of the adult-onset focal dystonias, focusing attention on less well understood clinical manifestations that need further study. It also provides a simple conceptual model for the similarities and differences among the different adult-onset focal dystonias as a rationale for lumping them together as a class of disorders while at the same time splitting them into subtypes. The concluding section outlines some of the most important research questions for the future. Answers to these questions are critical for advancing our understanding of this group of disorders and for developing novel therapeutics. ? 2013 Movement Disorder Society
