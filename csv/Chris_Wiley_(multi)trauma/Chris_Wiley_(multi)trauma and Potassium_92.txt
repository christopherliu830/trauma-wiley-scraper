AB  - Abstract Diabetes mellitus (DM) is not a single disease, but several pathophysiological conditions where synthesis, release, and/or action of insulin are disturbed. A progressive autoimmune/autoinflammatory destruction of islet cells is still considered the main pathophysiological event in the development of T1DM, but there is evidence that T1DM itself is a heterogeneous disease. More than 50 gene regions are closely associated with T1DM and a variety of epigenetic factors and metabolic patterns have been characterized, which may play a role in the development of T1DM. The pathogenesis and genetics of type 2 DM (T2DM) are distinct from T1DM. Genes associated with T2DM are distinct from those in T1DM. Characteristic metabolic patterns, different from those in T1DM were reported in T2DM, and some children with T2DM also express islet-antibodies. Huge progress has been made in the characterization of other specific types of DM, which had been considered very rare before. The molecular clarification of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) has greatly improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of DM. There are genetic overlaps between T2DM and monogenetic DM. Neonatal DM has been shown to be monogenetic in most cases, and genetic elucidation leads to more precise and individualized therapies. Cystic fibrosis related DM (CFRDM) should be considered a genuine part of cystic fibrosis, and not a complication, since pancreatic fibrosis does not sufficiently explain the pathophysiology of CFRDM. Disturbances of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) as well as autoimmunity are involved in the pathogenesis of CFRDM.

AB  - Summary Increasing numbers of diabetes inpatients across all hospital wards and specialities means that dietitians working in all areas need to have a good understanding of the guidelines for diabetes inpatients and how these apply to their particular patients? needs. In order to minimise impact on appetite for meals, oral nutrition supplements (ONS) are usually prescribed between meals, potentially resulting in extended periods when blood glucose concentrations maybe elevated. Exclusive enteral nutrition induces a more pronounced insulin and glucose response than solid, oral nutrition. Dietitians should be aware of appropriate insulin and medication regimes suited to different feeding rates and timings. Factors to be considered when planning nutritional support include individual nutritional requirements, gut absorption, suitability and tolerance of night-time enteral nutrition, and the need for breaks for procedures or other events. Current guidelines do not make full recommendation for management of patients requiring total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

AB  - Abstract Introduction: Intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) is sometimes necessary in patients with a bleeding risk, i.e., before/after surgery or brain hemorrhage. In such case IHD has to be modified to limit the conventional anticoagulation used to avoid clotting of the extracorporeal circuit (ECC). We evaluated if priming using a heparin and albumin (HA) mixture could minimize the exposure to heparin. Methods: Retrospective data from 1995 to 2013 were collected from 1408 acute dialysis treatment protocols that included 321 patients. Comparisons were made between IHD patients that had increased risk for bleeding and were treated by standard anticoagulation (Group-S), and patients at increased risk of bleeding (Group-HA). The ECC in Group-HA was primed with a solution of unfractioned heparin (UFH) (5000 Units/L) and albumin (1 g/L) in saline that was discarded after priming. There were 16 different dialyzers in the material. Findings: Comparing Group-S (n?=?883) with Group-HA (n?=?221), the mean age was 61.6 vs. 62.2 years (P?=?0.8), dialysis time was 197 vs. 190 minutes (P?=?0.002), and total dose of intravenous anticoagulant/IHD was at median 5000 Units vs. 1200 Units (P?=?0.001). Twenty-four percent of patients were treated without any additional heparin. Clotting resulting in interrupted dialysis was similar in both groups (0.8% for Group-S vs. 1.0% for Group-HA, P?=?0.8). No secondary bleeding was reported in either group. Discussion: HA priming minimized the risk of clotting and enabled acute IHD in vulnerable patients without increased bleeding, thus allowing completion of IHD to the same extent as for standard HD.

AB  - Overview The mouth is a frequent site of direct and indirect adverse side effects of cancer therapy. In myelosuppressed patients, its diverse microbiota makes the oral cavity both a site of local infection and a potential source of bacteremias and sepsis. While about half of all patients being treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy will develop some form of oral toxicity or infection, almost every patient receiving an aggressive myeloablative regimen or local radiotherapy to the head and neck manifests acute and chronic toxicities. The diversity of the tissues found in and around the mouth?keratinized and nonkeratinized mucosa, bone, salivary glands, and teeth?contributes to the range of susceptibility, acuity, and clinical implications of regimen-related oral complications. In almost all instances, precancer treatment elimination or control of existing oral diseases and aggressive management of oral health during cancer therapy favorably impacts outcomes.
