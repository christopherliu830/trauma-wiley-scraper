AB  - Summary Ballistics describes the science of gunshots, which can be subdivided into the three branches: (inside the firearm), exterior (from muzzle to target) and terminal (target) ballistics. The major task of this heterogeneous discipline is the reconstruction of events producing a gunshot injury. For the production of gunshot wounds, specialised tools are needed. It is therefore necessary for the forensics expert to acquire at least a basic knowledge of firearms and bullets. This chapter explains some of the basic components of firearms. Interior ballistics deals with the processes inside the weapon from the moment the firing pin hits the primer to the time the bullet leaves the barrel. Exterior ballistics is concerned with the flight of the projectile in air from the muzzle to the target. Wound ballistics is the science of the penetration of biological targets by a missile. The chapter further talks about arrow wounds and explosive injuries.

AB  - Background Dermatophytosis is a superficial fungal skin disease of cats and dogs. The most common pathogens of small animals belong to the genera Microsporum and Trichophyton. It is an important skin disease because it is contagious, infectious and can be transmitted to people. Objectives The objective of this document is to review the existing literature and provide consensus recommendations for veterinary clinicians and lay people on the diagnosis and treatment of dermatophytosis in cats and dogs. Methods The authors served as a Guideline Panel (GP) and reviewed the literature available prior to September 2016. The GP prepared a detailed literature review and made recommendations on selected topics. The World Association of Veterinary Dermatology (WAVD) provided guidance and oversight for this process. A draft of the document was presented at the 8th World Congress of Veterinary Dermatology (May 2016) and was then made available via the World Wide Web to the member organizations of the WAVD for a period of three months. Comments were solicited and posted to the GP electronically. Responses were incorporated by the GP into the final document. Conclusions No one diagnostic test was identified as the gold standard. Successful treatment requires concurrent use of systemic oral antifungals and topical disinfection of the hair coat. Wood's lamp and direct examinations have good positive and negative predictability, systemic antifungal drugs have a wide margin of safety and physical cleaning is most important for decontamination of the exposed environments. Finally, serious complications of animal?human transmission are exceedingly rare.

AB  - Abstract:? A family with congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type III was studied. Twenty patients and 10 of their healthy siblings were clinically examined and questioned about their medical history. Blood sampling and bone marrow aspirations were also performed. Forty-five percent of the patients reported symptoms of anaemia and 35% regularly felt weakness, fatigue, or headache. However, the majority of the patients regarded themselves as healthy. The bone marrow showed a uniform picture of erythroid hyperplasia with multinuclear erythroblasts and gigantoblasts with up to 12 nuclei. There was laboratory evidence of intravascular haemolysis and mild anaemia. We also observed a high prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (3 cases) and myeloma (1 case) among the patients.

AB  - Abstract Critical illness, more precisely defined as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), occurs in 20%?50% of patients who have been on mechanical ventilation for more than 1 week in an intensive care unit. Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) and myopathy (CIM), singly or in combination, occur commonly in these patients and present as limb weakness and difficulty in weaning from the ventilator. Critical illness myopathy can be subdivided into thick-filament (myosin) loss, cachectic myopathy, acute rhabdomyolysis, and acute necrotizing myopathy of intensive care. SIRS is the predominant underlying factor in CIP and is likely a factor in CIM even though the effects of neuromuscular blocking agents and steroids predominate in CIM. Identification and characterization of the polyneuropathy and myopathy depend upon neurological examination, electrophysiological studies, measurement of serum creatine kinase, and, if features suggest a myopathy, muscle biopsy. The information is valuable in deciding treatment and prognosis. Muscle Nerve, 2005

AB  - Summary No drugs in anaesthesia are more problematic than suxamethonium. Yet, no drugs have survived as suxamethonium does in spite of crisis after crisis, and attempt after attempt at its replacement. For decades, suxamethonium has taught us neuromuscular pharmacology and provided us with an encyclopaedia of side effects, while benefiting millions and millions of our anaesthetised patients. With the arrival of sugammadex, it finally appears that suxamethonium can be retired. Suxamethonium has done its job and seen its days! The present review is intended to offer a eulogy for suxamethonium.
