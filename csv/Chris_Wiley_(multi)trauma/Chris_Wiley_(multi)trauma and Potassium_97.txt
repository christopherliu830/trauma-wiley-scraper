AB  - Abstract This review outlines some of the analytical challenges associated with the analysis of microdialysis (MD) samples, in particular, the minute complex sample volumes that are often encountered. In MD sampling many different low-molecular-weight molecules can be collected, but the research findings are often limited by the sensitivity, specificity, and reliability of the analytical technique that is coupled to the dialysis probe. Therefore it is critical that a lot of consideration is given in selecting the most suitable analytical method including the most appropriate detector. This review aims to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of a range of commonly used analytical methods employed in MD. In Section 1, a brief overview of the MD technique is described, followed by a discussion on some of the advantages and drawbacks of this sampling technique. Sections 2 and 3 examine analytical and other technical considerations regarding analysis, with special emphasis on the factors that specifically influence analytical detection. Section 4 outlines the most commonly employed analytical techniques used in MD, including HPLC coupled with various detectors. Detail is given regarding the LOD and LOQ for many applications using each detector. As MS is of such high importance in MD, a special sub-section has been devoted to it. The importance of CE is also highlighted, with specific applications described. In addition, analytical techniques that do not appear to have found routine use in MD are discussed. Section 5 is concerned with recent innovations in chemical separation techniques, in particular MCE and ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Specific applications of the coupling of these techniques with MD are highlighted, along with technical challenges associated with miniaturization. In the Section 6, the future outlook of MD is discussed. Techniques other than electrophoretic- and chromatographic based separation methods are outside the scope of this review.

AB  - Summary No drugs in anaesthesia are more problematic than suxamethonium. Yet, no drugs have survived as suxamethonium does in spite of crisis after crisis, and attempt after attempt at its replacement. For decades, suxamethonium has taught us neuromuscular pharmacology and provided us with an encyclopaedia of side effects, while benefiting millions and millions of our anaesthetised patients. With the arrival of sugammadex, it finally appears that suxamethonium can be retired. Suxamethonium has done its job and seen its days! The present review is intended to offer a eulogy for suxamethonium.

AB  - Summary Pregnant women represent a unique population that differs from the populace at large both in terms of susceptibility to certain agents and in the management of any exposures. This chapter addresses some of the special concerns of pregnant women exposed to a selected list of biological, chemical, and radiological agents. Obstetricians may be called on to make recommendations about management of pregnant women with these exposures. Pregnancy can confound the diagnosis of some of the conditions, and can result in delays in prompt initiation of treatment or prophylaxis due to concerns about risk to the developing fetus. Obstetricians play a critical role in evaluation, in treatment, and in advising of colleagues who are first responders or in primary care, public health, or emergency medicine. In most situations, treatment or prophylaxis for pregnant women does not differ from that for non-pregnant women.

AB  - Epilepsies are amongst the most frequent chronic neurological conditions. Patients suffer from spontaneously recurring seizures because of sudden extensive electrical gray matter discharges. Although the current drug therapy allows many patients at least some degree of a satisfying course of the disease, a substantial number of patients remain without adequate seizure control. Reasons are either refractoriness to anticonvulsant drugs or intolerable drug-related side effects. Epilepsy surgery should be considered in these cases as possible treatment option. Nevertheless, a considerable rate of patients will not be suitable candidates or continue to have seizures despite surgery. Therefore there is a substantial need for better antiepileptic drugs. The aim of this review is to highlight currently emerging different treatment approaches which may ameliorate the perspectives of patients with difficult-to-treat epilepsies.
