AB  - Introduction:? Sickle cell ulcers are a frequent dermatologic manifestation of sickle cell disease. They are almost exclusively described in the legs near the malleoli and are often bilateral. Such ulcers in the upper extremities are not described. We report a case of sickle cell ulcer in hand presumably related to arterio-venous fistula in the forearm placed for hemodialysis in a patient with chronic kidney disease. Case:? A 45-year-old African-American man with a history of sickle cell disease, hypertension, and kidney failure treated with hemodialysis presented with a painful wound in his left hand near the base of his thumb, which had been present for 6 weeks prior to presentation. There was no history of trauma. 6 months prior to the development of the ulcer, the patient had an arterio-venous fistula placed in the affected hand. The ulcer did not improve with use of antibiotics. Venous ultrasound of the left upper extremity showed occlusion of the cephalic vein and enlargement of the basilic vein. Subsequently, biopsy of the ulcer showed vascular proliferation with thickening of the vessel and obliteration of the vascular lumen. The blood vessels were plugged with sickled red blood cells, characteristic of sickle cell disease. Histological features of the lesion were indicative of vaso-occlusive disease, suggesting sickle cell ulcer. Patient was treated with surgical débridement and skin grafting after hyperbaric oxygen therapy that only resulted in partial recovery of the lesion. Discussion:? The pathogenesis of sickle cell ulcer is presumed to be related to a vaso-occlusive process, leading to tissue necrosis resulting in skin ulcers. Ulcers can occur spontaneously or with local trauma. Low oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, impaired venous hemodynamics, and low hemoglobin are recognized contributing factors. The arterio-venous fistula causing diversion of arterial blood probably contributed to the development of sickle cell ulcer. Conclusion:? Sickle cell ulcers in the hand, although extremely rare, can occur in sickle cell patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis with arterio-venous fistula. This results from the altered local vascular hemodynamics that predispose to vaso-occlusive conditions, eventually leading to ulceration.

AB  - The editors of Academic Emergency Medicine are pleased and privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, May 16?19, 2007, in Chicago. The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.

AB  - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) is a rare clinical syndrome defined by the presence of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The etiology of TTP-HUS is diverse, and many cases remain idiopathic. Recognized causes include Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, quinine toxicity, certain cancers and cancer chemotherapy, antiphospholipid antibodies, pregnancy and OCP's, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, OKT3, antiplatelet agents, AIDS and HIV infection, and pneumococcal infection. After an extensive literature review, we found no cases of TTP-HUS following traumatic injury. We present the case of a 57-year-old white male hemodialysis patient with end-stage renal disease secondary to type 2 diabetes, severe CAD with multiple MI's, HTN, history of coronary artery bypass grafting ?4, and transmyocardial reperfusion. The patient fell in the bathroom with questionable LOC and was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnosed by head CT. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet-count falling from 181,000 to 6000), hemolytic anemia, mental status changes, and renal function abnormalities. He was treated by plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Of interest, we present another case of TTP-HUS following trauma. A 42-year-old white male with no applicable medical history fell 6 feet from a ladder, developing a renal hematoma. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS. This patient was also treated with plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Based on these two case studies, we suggest that hematoma be considered as a potential trigger in the development of TTP-HUS.

AB  - Research shows that low albumin is correlated with higher morbidity and mortality in the dialysis population. The reasons for this are multi-factorial and may be related to inadequate protein intake, infection and sepsis, inadequate dialysis, or catabolism of uremia. USRDS data show that ESRD Network 16 tends to have lower albumins compared to other ESRD Networks. Objective:? To evaluate albumin status of HD patients at Puget Sound Kidney Centers, Everett, WA (ESRD Network 16) and identify potential factors that may put patients at risk of hypoalbuminemia. Methods:? Clinical and biochemical data were collected for 3 months on 221 HD patients. Data included serum albumin (bromcresol purple), calcium, phosphorus, CO2, Hct, % saturation, ferritin, PTH, BUN, Kt/V, URR, nPCR, hours of HD treatment, interdialytic fluid weight gains, DW changes, incidence of infection and hospitalization, catheter use for dialysis access, presence of diabetes and other co-morbidities, dialyzer reuse, social/psychological status, and use of nutrition supplements. All biochemical data were collected after the longest interdialytic period and analyzed at the same reference laboratory. Data were averaged for each patient for the 3 months and correlations between parameters were determined using Chi-square analysis. Results:? 25% of all patients had albumins <3.2?g/dL (reference range for normal population 3.5?5.0?g/dL). Patients with lower albumins were significantly more likely to have DM (p?<?0.02), use catheters for HD access (p?<?0.001), had infections during the previous month (p?<?0.001), been hospitalized during the previous month (p?<?0.002), have co-morbid issues (p?<?0.001), and use nutrition supplements (p?<?0.002). No other factors were significantly correlated with lower albumin. Conclusion:? Factors other than nutrition seem to be related to hypoalbuminemia. This study has prompted improved protocols for catheter care and use, infection control, and early intervention for nutrition supplement use. Increased screening and monitoring at-risk patients (those with diabetes and other co-morbid conditions) has resulted in improved patient care.

AB  - Abstract Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monogenic disease characterized by massive enlargement of fluid-filled cysts in the kidney. Due to its genetic pattern, the disease differs from other CKD. ADPKD is a multi-system, progressive disorder which is frequently complicated with hypertension, cardiovascular events and cerebrovascular disease. Thus, there are many clinical problems specific to ADPKD. In this article, we reviewed these clinical problems and their management in ADPKD with hemodialysis patients.
