AB  - Summary The role of the phagocytic function of monocytes and neutrophils in sepsis has been poorly investigated. The present study evaluated the impact of the phagocytic activity of neutrophils and monocytes on the outcome of patients with severe sepsis. Thirty-one patients and 30 healthy individuals were enrolled in the study. The phagocytic activity of monocytes and neutrophils was evaluated during 24?h after admission and the results were correlated to the expression of CD64 on neutrophils and monocytes, CD14 antigen on monocytes, the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and the patients' survival. A reduced phagocytic activity of neutrophils during the first 24?h after admission was a negative predictor for survival. Increased expression of CD64 antigen on polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and monocytes was favourably correlated to the patients' survival. In multivariate analysis the phagocytic activity of PMNs was the only independent predictor factor for survival. Patients with PMN phagocytic activity <37% had lower expression of CD64 on monocytes and PMNs and worse outcome, while those with phagocytic activity >37% had higher expression of CD64 on monocytes and PMNs and better outcome. Reduced phagocytic activity of neutrophils may represent a state of neutrophil inactivation similar to that previously described for monocytes during the compensatory anti-inflammatory response.

AB  - Background:? The purpose of this study was to evaluate the amount of neo-intimal tissue in-growth present at the arterial and venous sides of the anastomosis and the degree of endothelial cell lining of the graft lumen in sheep using commercial vascular grafts coated with the P15 cell-binding peptide. Methods:? ePTFE vascular grafts were coated with the cell-binding P15 peptide using a newly developed plasma surface treatment method. 4 P15-treated grafts and 2 control grafts were implanted as arterio-venous fistulas between the femoral artery and vein and between the carotid artery and jugular vein in 2 sheep. 1 animal was euthanized after 14 days and the other animal after 28 days. The grafts along with the connecting arteries and veins were explanted and evaluated for the length of tissue in-growth along the luminal surface of the ePTFE graft from the anastomosis at the arterial and venous sides. Intimal thickness was carefully measured. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) was used to confirm the endothelial cell lining. Results:? The study showed a significant difference (p?<?0.05) in intimal thickness between the coated and uncoated grafts in the venous side of the anastomosis. The average intimal thickness of coated samples (551??m) was 3 times thinner than that of uncoated ones (1657??m). The endothelial cell lining appeared to be thicker, and its coverage was more uniform for the peptide-coated grafts than the uncoated ones. Overall, there was more neo-intimal tissue in-growth at the venous side than the arterial side of the anastomosis. The intima at the venous side was also thicker and more bulky compared to the arterial side. Conclusion:? This study has demonstrated that P15-coated ePTFE grafts had less intimal tissue in-growth developed at the venous side of the anastomosis than the uncoated ePTFE grafts. The degree of endothelial cell lining for coated samples was also higher than uncoated ones, which is consistent with our in vitro studies using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. P15-coated ePTFE graft materials had significantly improved cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration in vitro over uncoated ePTFE.

AB  - Introduction:? Terminally ill patients requiring dialysis present complex ethical and medical dilemma to the nephrologists. With the rising health care costs and futility of care in such cases, the financial burden is a lingering concern. Methods:? We describe a 77-year-old male with lymphoma and prostate cancer admitted for abdominal pain and weight loss. He was found to have metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma on laparotomy. His malignancy was deemed inoperable and was offered palliative care. Subsequent hospital course was complicated by sepsis with multiple organ failure resulting in acute renal failure requiring dialysis support. Being aware of his poor prognosis, patient initially declined interventions including dialysis. He was later convinced by his family and agreed to aggressive therapeutic intervention. Anticipating a complicated course, hemodialysis was initiated through cuffed tunneled catheter (CTC). Subsequently, he had multiple episodes of sepsis resulting in removal of CTC, necessitating insertion of 9 temporary dialysis catheters and 3 CTC over a 9-month period; further complicated by thrombosis of both femoral veins. Eventually, patient's condition progressively deteriorated and dialysis was withdrawn with family's consent 9 months following surgery. Patient was put on comfort care and died 2 days later. He spent a total of 7½ months in ICU, 1 month in skilled care facility, and 2 weeks on regular hospital floor. Total VAMC expenditure was $373,964, which in a private setting would be approximately $1.0 million. Conclusion:? This case highlights the futility of aggressive management of renal failure in terminally ill elderly patients. Besides its inability to improve quality of life, it adds as a financial burden to the society.

AB  - Severe lithium poisoning requires intensive and prolonged hemodialysis (HD) treatment in addition to supportive therapy. Aggressive dialytic therapy can bring about hypophosphatemia, especially, in those patients who are normo- or hypophosphatemic to begin with. We report here the use of phosphorus (P)-enriched HD in a hypophosphatemic patient with lithium poisoning. A 58-year-old woman with a long history of bipolar disorder treated with chronic lithium therapy presented with progressively worsening confusion and incoherent speech. She was noted to be confused with a labile mood. The serum levels were lithium 3.6?mM, creatinine 1.7?mg/dL, Na 136?mM, K 4.2?mM, CO2 21?mM, BUN 23?mg/dL, and P 2.1?mg/dL. After a conventional, 4-h HD session, she became more hypophosphatemic with a P level of 1.8?mg/dL. A P-enriched dialysate, prepared by adding a Fleet? oral saline laxative preparation (containing NaH2PO4.H2O and Na2HPO4.7H2O) to the ?base concentrate? of a dual concentrate, bicarbonate-based dialysate generating system to obtain a final dialysate containing 3?mg (0.97?mM) of P/dL was used. She underwent 3 subsequent HD sessions using this P-enriched dialysate, followed by normalization of the serum levels of both lithium and P. Our data suggest that hypophosphatemic patients suffering from severe lithium poisoning requiring intensive HD therapy and becoming more hypophosphatemic as a result of the dialysis treatment can be further dialyzed with a P-enriched dialysate both to treat the lithium poisoning and to rectify the hypophosphatemia. In general, the use of such dialysates can play an important role in the prevention and treatment of dialysis-induced hypophosphatemia.

AB  - Valproic acid toxicity is not infrequent and is difficult to treat, as there is no specific antidote. In the past, this drug was considered unremovable by extracorporeal methods because of the highly protein bound state (90?95%). However, recent reports suggest that the toxicokinetics of valproate vary considerably from the pharmacokinetics at therapeutic levels, and at higher concentrations protein-binding sites become saturated. The drug's relatively low molecular weight (144?Da), small volume of distribution (0.13?0.23?L/kg), and saturable protein binding render it potentially amenable to extracorporeal removal, but published experience is scant and there are only a few reported instances in which patients were successfully treated with extracorporeal methods. Here we report the case of a patient with serious valproate toxicity treated with simultaneous ?in series? hemodialysis and hemoperfusion followed by continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration. A 35-year-old homeless male presented to the emergency department after ingesting 120 pills of valproic acid. Initial valproic acid level was 59?µg/mL. Urine drug screen was negative and serum chemistries including LFTs were normal. He was treated with activated charcoal and admitted to the intensive care unit. 4 h later, he developed respiratory failure and became hemodynamically unstable. He was intubated and successfully resuscitated. Subsequently, the valproic acid level was found to be 553?µg/mL and a decision was made to employ extracorporeal methods for drug removal. ?In series? hemodialysis and hemoperfusion were done for 4?h and simultaneous blood samples for measurement of valproic acid levels were obtained as blood entered the hemoperfusion column (arterial) and as it exited the hemodialysis membrane (venous). Extraction ratio, whole blood, and plasma clearances were calculated and they compared substantially with the published data. The above measures decreased valproate levels from 572.6 (pre-dialysis level) to 203.2?µg/mL. This was followed by continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration for 18?h, which sustained the drug removal and prevented significant post-dialytic rebound. This is the first reported instance in which these three methods were administered together successfully in the management of valproic acid toxicity.

AB  - Plasma fibrinogen is a well-known predictor of cardiovascular disturbances, and C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with elevated causes of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. That is the reason to look for the causes of increased CRP levels in CRF and haemodialysis (HD). The study tries to find whether interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a consistent factor for CRP elevation in CRF and/or in HD patients, when a dialysis-induced IL-6 synthesis may occur, as IL-6 has been claimed as a responsible factor for production of some acute phase proteins like CRP. CRP [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique, limit 0.1?µg/L], IL-6 (ELISA, Medgenix, Brussels, Belgium), and fibrinogen (photometric technique) were tested in 45 stable predialytic CRF patients (mean age 48?±?7 years) and in 50 stable HD patients (mean age 62?±?15). In CRF patients, a positive correlation was found between plasma fibrinogen (mean 356?±?167?mg/dL) and CRP (r?=?0.51, p?<?0.01) and between fibrinogen and proteinuria (r?=?0.32, p?<?0.01), but no correlation was found between CRP and IL-6. In HD patients, a high positive correlation was registered between CRP (mean 6.93?±?5.88?mg/L) and IL-6 (mean 9.4?±?10.6?pg/mL) (r?=?0.84, p?<?0.001) and between CRP and fibrinogen (mean 325?±?110?mg/dL) (r?=?0.59, p?<?0.001). The study suggests that, in HD patients, one of the factors stimulating hepatic production of CRP is probably IL-6, which is synthesized by the dialysis-related, activated macrophages. In predialytic patients, the bacterial products in dialysate and their effect on macrophages are absent and there is no correlation between CRP and IL-6.

AB  - The purpose of the poster was to demonstrate how Leininger's theory of transcultural nursing is utilized daily within the multicultural pediatric population at the hospital for sick children. Methods:? Within this diverse and challenging population, the hemodialysis nurse is constantly challenged to ensure that the nursing care provided to the patient is reflective and meeting the needs of our pediatric population and their families. Leininger's theory of transcultural nursing has provided an avenue to ensure that the many cultures of our clients are maintained and respected. A case study will be used to show the integration of Leininger's theory. Resources for supporting the cultural values of the hemodialysis patient will also be identified. Conclusion:? The use of a transcultural nursing model enhances the quality and effectiveness of the patient care provider for the pediatric hemodialysis patient at the hospital for sick children. Utilization of a transcultural nursing model ensures that the patients and their families are respected and supported for their diverse backgrounds by the hemodialysis nurse. The hemodialysis nurses are providing quality nursing care which reflects the needs and concerns of a multicultural population.

AB  - The LifeSite System is a new subcutaneous vascular access option for hemodialysis patients. As the procedure for accessing the LifeSite differs from hemodialysis catheters, we prospectively studied the differences in time required to initiate and discontinue treatments for LifeSite patients compared to patients with hemodialysis catheters. We also collected data on the cost of supplies and the number of alarms during dialysis for both groups. 5 LifeSite and 5 catheter patients were chosen at random for participation in the study. The time required for the ON and OFF procedures was recorded for 3 consecutive dialysis sessions for each patient for a total of 15 observations/group. The average staff time required per session for supply preparation, ON/OFF procedure, dressing changes, and responding to alarms was 15.9?min for the LifeSite and 16.9?min for catheters. Catheter patients experienced 4.5 access-related alarms per session compared to 2.5 access-related alarms per session for LifeSite patients. This increase in the number alarms for catheter patients resulted in an increase in average staff time required to resolve the cause of these alarms vs. LifeSite patients (3.4 vs. 0.87?min/session). There was a minimal difference in the cost of access-related supplies between LifeSite and catheter patients at our center ($3.71 vs. $3.88 per session, respectively) based on dialysis center acquisition costs. This study demonstrates that attaining a critical mass of LifeSite patients in a dialysis unit enables the dialysis staff to develop the skill to initiate and discontinue treatments for patients with the LifeSite in a timeframe similar to that required to do the same for catheter patients. The overall cost of supplies to care for LifeSite patients in a dialysis unit is also similar to those used for catheter patients.

AB  - Acute renal failure requiring dialysis therapy after cardiac surgery occurs in 1?5% of patients; however, the optimal timing for the initiation of dialysis therapy still remains undetermined. To assess the validity of early start of dialysis therapy, we studied the comparative survival between 14 patients who started to receive dialysis therapy with the timing of decrease of urine volume less than 30?mL/h and other 14 patients who waited to begin dialysis therapy until the level of urine volume of less than 20?mL/h during 14 days. Overall mortality of those patients was 50%. Twelve of 14 patients who received the early intervention survived. In contrast, only 2 of 14 patients in the other group survived. There was a significant difference of p?<?0.01 between the two groups. Between the two groups, there were no significant differences in age, sex ratio, the score of APACHE (Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation) II, and the levels of serum creatinine at the start of dialysis therapy (2.9?+?0.2 vs. 3.1?+?0.2?mg/dL) as well as in the levels of serum creatinine at admission. The start timing for the treatment of acute renal failure following cardiac surgery would be determined by the decrease of urine volume but not by the levels of serum creatinine. The early start of dialysis therapy might be preferable for the improvement of survival of the patients suffering from acute renal failure following cardiac surgery.
