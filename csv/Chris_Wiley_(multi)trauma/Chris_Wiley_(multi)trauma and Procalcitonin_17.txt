AB  - Dialysis adequacy indexed by Kt/V in hemodialysis (HD) patients is recommended as a single-pool Kt/V of at least 1.2 per session thrice weekly. But many patients cannot achieve this adequacy target. Although dialysis time is the most important as a factor influencing Kt/V, it is difficult to prolong dialysis time in practice because of its economic impact and poor patient compliance. Objective:? The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of increasing blood flow rate on dialysis adequacy in HD patients with low Kt/V. Methods:? This study enrolled 36 HD patients with single-pool Kt/V <1.2 per session thrice weekly, which was measured in dialyzer blood flow rate of 230?mL/min. We increased 15% of blood flow rate in patients <65?kg of body weight and 20% in patients >65?kg. And then we compared Kt/V and urea reduction ratio (URR) between before and after increasing blood flow rate. Results:? The mean age was 48?±?11 years (23?73 years), and the number of males was 25. Of the total patients, 24 patients had dry weight <65?kg. Mean dialysis duration was 52?±?50 months (3?216 months). Mean Kt/V before increasing blood flow rate was 1.02?±?0.09. It increased to 1.14?±?0.12 after increasing blood flow rate (p?<?0.001). Of the total 36 patients, 13 patients (36.1%) achieved adequacy target (Kt/V?≤?1.2). Mean URR before increasing blood flow rate was 56.9?±?4.0%. It also increased to 60.8?±?4.1% (p?<?0.001). Conclusion:? Our data suggest that increasing blood flow rate by 15?20% of previous flow rate is effective in achieving dialysis adequacy in HD patients with low Kt/V.

AB  - In March 2003, a series of cases of sudden respiratory disease syndrome (SARS) has been reported to be spreading in Toronto. With limited knowledge of the causative agent, an immediate strategy that would help contain and prevent the dissemination of the disease especially among our immunosuppressed hemodialysis patients was required. Objective:? To share the precautionary measures implemented in our unit in containing or preventing the spread of the virus among our hemodialysis patients. Methods:? Retrospective analysis of the impact of the implementation of strict measure of disease control and education of all staff. Other data were gathered through interviews of some Microbiologists in Toronto, St. Michael's Hospital Infection Control Department and Health, Canada. Result:? The precautionary measure implemented has been successful. None of our dialysis patients or health care workers were affected. Conclusion:? The measures implemented has not been proven 100% effective in protecting our dialysis patients and our staff, but we hope that the data will help prepare other health care professionals and other dialysis institutions in the event of another outbreak.

AB  - Summary Patients with a variety of haematological conditions are at risk of infection and its most serious complication: septic shock. Mortality for septic shock remains high and especially so in patients with haematological malignancy and following bone marrow transplantation. However, advances in the treatment of severe sepsis have improved mortality rates even though evidence for the management of severe sepsis in haematology patients is limited. Wherever possible this review will concentrate on evidence directly applicable to haematology patients but inevitably will have to extrapolate evidence from other patient groups. The Surviving Sepsis Guidelines 2008 provide information on best practice in the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock and are broadly applicable though not specific to haematology patients. This review summarizes a practical approach to the management of severe sepsis in haematology patients and highlights areas of research which may bring new treatments in the future. The review is limited to the management and initial resuscitation of septic shock in adult haematology patients and will not address the detailed intensive care management of these patients or the management of severe sepsis in children.

AB  - Summary Cancer and its treatment can lead to a range of acute and life-threatening medical emergencies. These conditions require prompt assessment, investigation and treatment. The management of oncology patients can be more complex than other medical patients due to the impact of concurrent chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy as well as prior or planned surgery. Patients' prognosis and the intent of their cancer treatment is also critical for decision making in the short or intermediate term. This chapter highlights the management for adult cancer patients for a range of the most common and important emergencies in oncology. It aims to provide an overview of the most commonly encountered emergencies, including anaphylaxis, bleeding, spinal cord compression, neutropenic sepsis, tumour lysis syndrome, hypercalcaemia and superior vena cava obstruction.
