AB  - Abstract Background:? Severity prediction is difficult early in the course of acute pancreatitis. Markers of pancreatic injury, or inflammatory activation are candidate markers of severity. The aim of the present study was to assess predictive abilities of carboxypeptidase-B activation peptide (CAPAP-B) and soluble l-selectin (sL-selectin) using samples collected on admission to hospital. Methods:? Patients with acute pancreatitis and disease (acute abdomen) and normal controls were studied. Samples were collected at admission and daily for 5?days. There were significant differences between mild and severe pancreatitis in urinary and plasma CAPAP-B on admission, C-reactive protein on day 3 and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE)-II scores. Prediction of severity with CAPAP-B on admission was as good as with APACHE-II score after 48?h. Carboxypeptidase-B activation peptide was not raised in disease controls. By contrast, sL-selectin was lowered in all cases of acute pancreatitis, and in disease controls. There was no difference between mild and severe pancreatitis. Conclusion:? Urinary CAPAP-B, a marker of acinar injury, can be used to predict severity of acute pancreatitis at the time of admission to hospital, but sL-selectin has no value in this regard. The extent of acinar injury may be a more important early marker of severity than markers of inflammatory activation.

AB  - Summary Hellmut Hartert was the first person to exploit the viscoelastic properties of clotting blood to measure blood coagulation in 1948. Since then, the technology has improved, allowing these analyses to be performed as point-of-care tests with immediately-available results. The addition of several activators and inhibitors to the original assay creates a panel of tests able to quantify the different aspects of blood clotting that can rival conventional laboratory assays. However, although much progress has been made, the standardization and validation of these tests still need improvement. Viscoelastic analyses of blood coagulation are mainly used to guide haemostatic therapy in bleeding patients and have proven superior to standard clotting tests in some circumstances. There is potential to extend their use to other areas, such as drug monitoring, and diagnosis and management of congenital bleeding disorders. The forthcoming cartridge-based assays are expected to improve the reliability and usability of viscoelastic assays of blood coagulation but high quality clinical trials remain urgently needed to determine their exact place, benefit and cost effectiveness.

AB  - Abstract Introduction. Recognition of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), intensive care, shifting away from early surgical treatment, and monitoring of the intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is important in the management of SAP. The aim of our study was retrospective evaluation and critical assessment of the experience with SAP management protocol involving new strategy in the university hospital. Methods. Protocols of 274 SAP patients treated in our institution during the last eight years were reassessed. APACHE II, CRP and SOFA score, IAP, pulmonary complications, ventilatory support and infection rate were evaluated. The success of the conservative treatment, surgical interventions and mortality was analysed comparing period 1 from 1999 to 2002 and period 2 from 2003 to 2006. Results. More patients with necrotising SAP were treated in period 2. The average CRP and SOFA score was higher in period 2, p=0.018; p=0.011. A total of 139 patients underwent continuous veno-venouse haemofiltration (CVVH) as a component of fluid resuscitation and IAP control. Application of CVVH increased in period 2, p<0.005. Only 5?8% of patients were managed with ventilatory support. The overall infection rate decreased in period 2 comprising 21%, p<0.005. Success rate of the conservative therapy reached 69% in period 2, p<0.01. Surgical treatment was performed in 41% of patients in period 1 vs. 19% in period 2, p<0.001. Overall mortality was 19%, with a reduction to 12% in year 2006. Conclusion. The conservative protocol-based approach is a rational treatment strategy for the management of SAP and can be successfully implemented in the setting of the university hospital.

AB  - Summary Urologic surgery has evolved to the minimally invasive techniques, endourology and laparoscopy, which offer excellent results with less morbidity to the patient. Nevertheless, we should always be cautious of the infectious complications that can appear or be aggravated by surgical interventions. A thorough preoperative work-up, identification of risk factors, use of preventive general measures, antibiotic prophylaxis, and careful follow-up are imperative in order to avoid or minimize the risk of infectious complications that may lead to a septic episode. Once we suspect that a septic process is developing, a prompt and precise series of actions has to be performed, including a multidisciplinary approach and management, with the intention to limit the damage and favor an adequate recovery.
