AB  - Abstract Introduction Infection is one of the most significant complications following heart transplantation (HT). The aim of this study was to identify specific risk factors for early postoperative infections in HT recipients, and to develop a multivariable predictive model to identify HT recipients at high risk. Methods A single-center, observational, and retrospective study was conducted. The dependent variable was in-hospital postoperative infection. We examined demographic and epidemiological data from donors and recipients, surgical features, and adverse postoperative events as independent variables. Backwards, stepwise multivariable logistic regression with a P-value < 0.05 was used to identify clinical factors independently associated with the risk of in-hospital postoperative infections following HT. Results Six hundred seventy-seven patients were included in this study. During the in-hospital postoperative period, 348 episodes of infection were diagnosed in 239 (35.9%) patients. Seven variables were identified as independent clinical predictors of early postoperative infection after HT: history of diabetes mellitus, previous sternotomy, preoperative mechanical ventilation, primary graft failure, major surgical bleeding, use of mycophenolate mofetil, and use of itraconazole. Based on the results of multivariable models, we constructed a 7-variable (8-point) score to predict the risk of in-hospital postoperative infection in HT recipients, which showed a reasonable ability to predict the risk of in-hospital postoperative infection in this population. Prospective external validation of this new score is warranted to confirm its clinical applicability. Conclusions In-hospital postoperative infection is a common complication after HT, affecting 35% of patients who underwent this procedure at our institution. Diabetes mellitus, previous sternotomy, preoperative mechanical ventilation, primary graft failure, major surgical bleeding, use of mycophenolate mofetil, and itraconazole were all independent clinical predictors of early postoperative infection after HT.

AB  - Summary Septic shock is characterized by an inability of the host to maintain vascular integrity and fluid homeostasis, resulting in inadequate tissue oxygenation and circulatory failure. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) describes a generalized inflammatory response of the host to a variety of insults. SIRS is considered a clinical syndrome that is a form of dysregulated inflammation. Disruption of the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle is a well-recognized component of septic shock. The clinical spectrum of sepsis depends primarily on the host response to infection rather than the severity of the infection itself. The pregnant host may be different from the traditional septic shock host in ways other than the difference in microbiologic pathogens involved. Physiologic adaptations to pregnancy designed to promote favorable maternal and fetal outcome occur in almost every organ system. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in 50 percent of patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.

AB  - Abstract The Japanese Dermatological Association prepared guidelines focused on the treatment of skin ulcers associated with connective tissue disease/vasculitis practical in clinical settings of dermatological care. Skin ulcers associated with connective tissue diseases or vasculitis occur on the background of a wide variety of diseases including, typically, systemic sclerosis but also systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), dermatomyositis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), various vasculitides and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). Therefore, in preparing the present guidelines, we considered diagnostic/therapeutic approaches appropriate for each of these disorders to be necessary and developed algorithms and clinical questions for systemic sclerosis, SLE, dermatomyositis, RA, vasculitis and APS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Aggressive i.v. hydration with crystalloids is the first step in managing acute pancreatitis (AP) and is associated with improved survival. Guidelines about the choice of crystalloids to use are unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis was aimed to discern whether the choice of fluids in managing pancreatitis was associated with patients' outcomes. METHODS A comprehensive literature review was conducted by searching the Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed and Google Scholar databases to December 2017 to identify all studies that compared normal saline (NS) with Ringer's lactate (RL) for managing AP. The characteristics of the participants, outcome measurements (including mortality, the development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome [SIRS] on admission and at 24?h, and pancreatic necrosis) were analyzed. RESULTS Five studies (three randomized controlled trials and two retrospective cohort studies) with 428 patients were included in this analysis. Mortality trended lower in the RL group but this was not statistically significant (pooled odds ratio [OR] 0.61, 95% CI 0.28?1.29, P?=?0.20). Patients in the RL group had significantly decreased odds of developing SIRS at 24?h (pooled OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15?0.98, P?=?0.05). CONCLUSIONS RL has anti-inflammatory effects and is associated with decreased odds of persistent SIRS at 24?h, which is a marker of severe disease in AP patients. Although mortality trended lower in the RL group this did not achieve statistical significance and hence larger randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate this association.
