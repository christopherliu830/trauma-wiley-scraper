AB  - Summary This chapter includes HGNC entries for proteins that are expressed on the cell surface, namely receptors for different ligand classes, transporters and ion channels. Targets for existing drugs are strongly over-represented in this group; for example, approximately 40% of current medicines affect G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and hundreds of these molecules are listed with annotations that indicate pharmaceutical potential. The chapter also discusses targets that involve protein-protein or protein-carbohydrate interactions. These are cytokines and their receptors, adhesion molecules and host defence molecules; the allocation of entries in these three sections is less clear-cut than with the GPCRs. The last group of entries that is discussed is the transporters and channels. The ATP-binding cassette and solute carrier families are not only primary therapeutic targets but also contain proteins that contribute to drug resistance.

AB  - Summary Antibodies can cause hyperacute, acute, or chronic rejection of allografts. These different types of rejection involve additional humoral mediators, including complement, coagulation factors, and cytokines, which engage cells of the innate immune system, notably platelets, granulocytes, and monocyte/macrophages. In this chapter we discuss the functional properties of antibodies that influence which humoral and cellular mediators are activated. Then the effects of complement activation and regulation are considered. The mechanisms by which antibodies and complement modulate interactions between innate immune cells and the vascular endothelium are summarized as a basis for understanding the pathogenesis of different types of graft destruction.

AB  - The Ehlers?Danlos syndromes comprise a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders, which are characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue friability. In the Villefranche Nosology, six subtypes were recognized: The classical, hypermobile, vascular, kyphoscoliotic, arthrochalasis, and dermatosparaxis subtypes of EDS. Except for the hypermobile subtype, defects had been identified in fibrillar collagens or in collagen-modifying enzymes. Since 1997, a whole spectrum of novel, clinically overlapping, rare EDS-variants have been delineated and genetic defects have been identified in an array of other extracellular matrix genes. Advances in molecular testing have made it possible to now identify the causative mutation for many patients presenting these phenotypes. The aim of this literature review is to summarize the current knowledge on the rare EDS subtypes and highlight areas for future research. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract More than a decade ago our groups pioneered the analysis of serum proteins of laboratory animals with up-to-date proteomic techniques. We were, and still are, convinced that conforming animal procedures to the minimally invasive approaches typical of clinical biochemistry focuses attention on the actual conditions under which any finding arrived at on animal models of disease may eventually be applied to human patients for screening/diagnosis. We are also convinced that, besides the proteins present in trace level as a result of tissue leakage during disorders affecting specific peripheral organs, changes in the concentration of some of the major serum proteins as part of an acute-phase response may be taken as biological end-points during a number of experimental procedures. When reviewing literature data about proteomic investigations on plasma or serum of mice, we realized that not much work has been done in the direction we favor. In addition, we noticed that sometimes information about serum proteome has been coarsely treated and in a few cases even misunderstood/misused. In the following, we present current findings on serum/plasma proteome of the laboratory mouse not only under control conditions and during an experimentally induced acute-phase reaction, but also in a number of models of disease, mainly related to cancer and to metabolic disorders.

Economic Aspects Blood is a multifunctional transport medium of vital importance for the body of higher organisms. Its composition is very complex and includes various cell systems with peculiar functions, proteins, electrolytes, metabolites, and highly sophisticated mediator systems. Both cells and plasma, which can be separated by centrifugation, can be used as and further processed into medicines. Serum is the fluid remaining after coagulation of the blood. In this review, blood cell systems and plasma proteins are referred to and medicinal aspects including blood and plasma collection and processing are described. The medicines derived from blood and plasma, as well as basic research and clinical trials should keep an important place because of the medicine as a whole benefits extremely from transfusions and, in particular, hemophiliacs gain an enormous improvement of life quality and life expectancy.
