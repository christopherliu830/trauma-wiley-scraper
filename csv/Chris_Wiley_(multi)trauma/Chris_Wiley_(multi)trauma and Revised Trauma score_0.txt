AB  - Background: Severe truncal multi trauma patients often develop coagulopathy, acidosis and hypothermia that makes major reparative trauma surgery dangerous. It was aimed to try to develop physiological indicators that would predict a poor outcome when conventional reparative surgery was applied. These indicators may help in the decision to switch from conventional reparative surgery to surgery limited to the control of major haemorrhage or organ disruption: so-called ?damage-control? surgery. Method: A retrospective review was conducted of 40 patients with severe multivisceral trauma (Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 35) who were admitted to the intensive care unit at Waikato Hospital and who underwent conventional reparative surgery. Results: Survival was strongly associated with base deficit (BD), core temperature and ISS. Using multiple logistic regression on these indices, outcome could be predicted with 92.5% accuracy (sensitivity = 93%, specificity = 92%, positive predictive value for death = 96%). Either severe hypothermia (< 33°C) or severe acidosis (BD > 12 mEq/L), or a combination of moderate core temperature < 35.5°C, and a BD of > 5 mEq/L were strong predictors of death if conventional reparative surgery was practised. Conclusions: At the abovementioned levels of physiological compromise, patient survival after conventional trauma surgery can be predicted to be very unlikely. Damage-control measures would be worth attempting.

AB  - Background:? The benefit of prehospital advanced life support (ALS) is disputed, as is the prehospital use of specially trained, hospital-based physicians. The purpose of the study was to assess the health benefit from an anesthesiologist-manned prehospital emergency medical service (EMS), and to separate the benefit of the anesthesiologist from that of rapid transport. Methods: ?The anesthesiologist-manned helicopter and rapid response car service at Rogaland Central Hospital assisted 1106 patients at the scene during the 18-month study period. Two expert panels assessed patients with a potential health benefit for life years gained (LYG) using a modified Delphi technique. The probability of survival as a result of the studied EMS was multiplied by the life expectancy of each patient. The benefit was attributed either to the anesthesiologist, the rapid transport or a combination of both. Results: ?The expert panels estimated a benefit of 504 LYG in 74 patients (7% of the total study population), with a median age of 54?years (range 0?88). The cause of the emergency was cardiac diseases (including cardiac arrest) in 61% of the 74 patients, trauma in 19%, and cardio-respiratory failure as a result of other conditions in 20%. The LYG were equally divided between air and ground missions, and the majority (88%) were attributed solely to ALS by the anesthesiologist. Conclusion:? The expert panels found LYG in every 14th patient assisted by this anesthesiologist-manned prehospital EMS. There was no difference in LYG between the helicopter and the rapid response car missions. The role of the anesthesiologist was crucial for health benefits.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To review emergency sedation intubation as practised in the Melbourne-based ambulance helicopter. Specifically, to describe patient profiles, drug dosage, difficulties encountered, success rate and patient outcomes. Methods: Retrospective review of all helicopter primary and secondary retrieval patients, who received application of the emergency sedation intubation protocol using morphine and diazepam during a 3 year period (January 1995 to December 1997). Data were collected from an audit of patient care records completed by flight paramedics and from hospital records. Results: Emergency sedation intubation was performed on 128 patients: 103 adults and 25 children. The median dose of drugs required for emergency sedation intubation by adult patients was 20 mg morphine and 20 mg diazepam. The overall success rate for emergency sedation intubation was 94.5%, with 73.6% of these being successful intubations at the first attempt. On intubation, 54.1% of patients were fully relaxed, while a gag reflex was still present in 45.9% of patients during or just after emergency sedation intubation. Twenty-two per cent of patients had a change in blood pressure of more than 20 mmHg. The maximum rise in blood pressure was 60 mmHg and the maximum fall was 80 mmHg. Conclusions: Flight paramedics achieved a high success rate for intubation with the morphine/ diazepam emergency sedation intubation protocol. However, there was still a significant percentage of patients for whom more than one attempt was required to achieve emergency sedation intubation and, in almost half the patients, gag reflexes remained present either during or immediately after intubation. Additionally, some patients experienced blood pressure changes following intubation that may have potential adverse consequences in terms of compromised cerebral perfusion or rises in intracranial pressure. Consideration should be given to revision of the protocol to allow the use of neuromuscular blocking agents and alternative airway management techniques, such as cricothyroidotomy, for specified circumstances in the aeromedical environment.

AB  - Background: Since 1992 the Consultative Committee on Road Traffic Fatalities in Victoria has identified deficiencies and errors in the management of 559 road traffic fatalities in which the patients were alive on arrival of ambulance services. The Committee also assessed the preventability of deaths. Reproducibility of results using its methodology has been shown to be statistically significant. The Committee?s findings and recommendations, the latter made in association with the learned Colleges and specialist Societies, led to the establishment of a Ministerial Taskforce on Trauma and Emergency Services. As a consequence, in 2000, a new trauma care system will be implemented in Victoria. This paper presents a case example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology. Methods: The Committee has two 12 member multidisciplinary evaluative panels. A retrospective evaluation was made of the complete ambulance, hospital and autopsy records of eligible fatalities. The clinical and pathological findings were analysed using a comprehensive data proforma, a narrative summary and the complete records. Resulting multidisciplinary discussion problems were identified and the potential preventability of death was assessed. Results: In the present case example the Committee identified 16 management deficiencies of which 11 were assessed as having contributed to the patient?s death; the death, however, was judged to be non-preventable. Conclusion: The presentation of this example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology may be of assistance to hospital medical staff undertaking their own major trauma audit.
