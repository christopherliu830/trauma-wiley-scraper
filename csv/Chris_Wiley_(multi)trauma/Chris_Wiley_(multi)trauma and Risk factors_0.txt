AB  - Acquired neuromuscular weakness due to critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy (CIPNM) frequently develops in patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit for more than 1?week. CIPNM may present with muscle weakness and failure to wean from mechanical ventilation, but is discovered more often and earlier by electrophysiological examination. In this review, the incidence, clinical and electrophysiological features, differential diagnosis and prognosis of CIPNM will be described. Risk factors for CIPNM are sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome and the severity of multi-organ failure. Presence of CIPNM is associated with higher mortality rate, prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and prolonged rehabilitation. The majority of survivors with CIPNM have persistent functional disabilities and a reduced quality of life. There is need for new therapeutic strategies to prevent or minimize CIPNM in critically ill patients.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to identify pressure ulcer (PU) incidence and risk factors that are associated with PU development in patients in two adult intensive care units (ICU) in Saudi Arabia. A prospective cohort study design was used. A total of 84 participants were screened second daily basis until discharge or death, over a consecutive 30-day period, out of which 33 participants with new PUs were identified giving a cumulative hospital-acquired PU incidence of 39·3% (33/84 participants). The incidence of medical devices-related PUs was 8·3% (7/84). Age, length of stay in the ICU, history of cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, infrequent repositioning, time of operation, emergency admission, mechanical ventilation and lower Braden Scale scores independently predicted the development of a PU. According to binary logistic regression analyses, age, longer stay in ICU and infrequent repositioning were significant predictors of all stages of PUs, while the length of stay in the ICU and infrequent repositioning were associated with the development of stages II?IV PUs. In conclusion, PU incidence rate was higher than that reported in other international studies. This indicates that urgent attention is required for PU prevention strategies in this setting.

AB  - Abstract Background and objective Acinetobacter baumannii and A. baumannii/calcoaceticus complex are commonly encountered pathogens in nosocomial infections. This study aimed to evaluate the treatment and prognostic risk factors in nosocomial pneumonia caused by these microorganisms. Methods The study was conducted retrospectively in Uludag University Hospital and included 356 adult non-neutropenic patients with nosocomial pneumonia. Results Of the subjects, 94.9% (n?=?338) had ventilator-associated pneumonia. The clinical response rate was 57.2%, the 14-day mortality 39.6% and the 30-day mortality 53.1%. The significant independent risk factors for the 30-day mortality were severe sepsis (OR, 2.60; 95% CI: 1.49?4.56; P?=?0.001), septic shock (OR, 6.12; 95% CI: 2.75?13.64; P?<?0.001), APACHE II score?≥?20 (OR, 2.12; 95% CI: 1.28?3.50; P?=?0.003) and empiric monotherapy (OR, 1.63; 95% CI: 1.00?2.64; P?=?0.048). Multi-trauma (OR, 2.50; 95% CI: 1.11?5.68; P?=?0.028) was found to be a protective factor. In patients with a clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS)?>?6 on the third day of treatment, both the 14- and 30-day mortality rates were high (P?<?0.001, P?<?0.001). Also, the 14- and 30-day mortality rates were significantly higher in the patients treated with empiric monotherapy compared with combination therapy (48/93 (51.6%)?46/123 (37.4%), P?=?0.037 and 62/93 (66.7%)?65/123 (52.8%), P?=?0.041, respectively) in pneumonia caused by imipenem-resistant strains. Conclusion Mortality rates were high in pneumonia caused by imipenem-resistant A. baumannii or A. baumannii/calcoaceticus complex. In the units with a high level of carbapenem resistance, antibiotic combinations should be considered for empiric therapy.

The present article reviews the clinical and imaging clearance of the thoracic and lumbar spines of blunt trauma victims and the evolution of these strategies with the use of new imaging technologies. Methods:? A comprehensive literature search was performed, and articles identified were critically appraised Results:? Twenty papers were identified, 12 directly comparing computed tomography screening with plain X-rays. Evidence-based protocols are presented. The evolution of imaging strategies in response to new technology is described. Conclusions:? Thoracolumbar spine screening is best done using reformatted images acquired when scanning the chest and abdomen of high-risk multi-trauma patients. If computed tomography is not clinically indicated for investigation of other injuries then plain films are the first line investigation.

AB  - Background Computed tomography (CT) is an essential diagnostic tool for severe multi-trauma patients. International guidelines recommend an optimal time of 1?h from arrival. The aim of this study was to determine the time interval from arrival at the emergency department to CT for all trauma patients and the effects on in-hospital mortality and hospital length of stay. Methods Retrospective study of all patients who triggered a trauma call and underwent CT scanning at the Gold Coast University Hospital from January 2016 to December 2017. Exclusion criteria were scans performed at peripheral hospitals or performed more than 5?h after arrival to emergency department. Results One thousand six hundred and nineteen eligible trauma patients were admitted over the study period and underwent CT scanning. Median time to CT was found to be 43?min. CTs done within 1?h compared to those done after 1?h from emergency department arrival were found to have a higher mean injury severity score (11 ±?10 versus 9 ±?9, P =?0.003), a longer mean hospital length of stay (9 ±?21 versus 7 ±?13?days, P =?0.012) and no difference in mortality rates (2.2% versus 2.1%, P =?1.000). Age, injury severity score and intubation status were identified as independent predictors for longer hospital length of stay and higher mortality while time to CT did not. Injury severity score was shown to be an independent predictor of time to CT. Conclusion Our time to CT scanning is well within the timeframe recommended by international guidelines. Early CT scanning may also improve outcomes in severely injured trauma patients.

AB  - Background Traumatic brain injury is a worldwide health issue and a significant cause of preventable deaths and disabilities. We aimed to describe population-based data on intensive care treated traumatic brain injury in Iceland over 15 years period. Methods Retrospective review of all intensive care unit admissions due to traumatic brain injury at The National University Hospital of Iceland 1999?2013. Data were collected on demographics, mechanism of injury, alcohol consumption, glasgow come scale upon admission, Injury Severity Scoring, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score, length of stay, interventions and mortality (defined as glasgow outcome score one). All computerized tomography scans were reviewed for Marshall score classification. Results Intensive care unit admissions due to traumatic brain injury were 583. The incidence decreased significantly from 14/100.000/year to 12/100.000/year. Males were 72% and the mean age was 41 year. Majority of patients (42%) had severe traumatic brain injury. The most common mechanism of injury was a fall from low heights (36.3%). The mortality was 18.2%. Increasing age, injury severity score, Marshall score and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score are all independent risk factors for death. Glasgow coma scale was not an independent prognostic factor for outcome. Conclusions Incidence decreased with a shift in injury mechanism from road traffic accidents to falls and an increased rate of traumatic brain injury in older patients following a fall from standing or low heights. Mortality was higher in older patients falling from low heights than in younger patients suffering multiple injuries in road traffic accidents. Age, injury severity score, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score and Marshall score are good prognostic factors for outcome. Traumatic brain injury continues to be a considerable problem and the increase in severe traumatic brain injury in the middle age and older age groups after a seemingly innocent accident needs a special attention.

To assess the temporal trends in the incidence and demographic characteristics of traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) with clinical concomitant traumatic brain injury (TBI), in an unselected, geographically defined cohort, 1952?2001. Material and methods??? The patients were identified from hospital records. TBI was classified as none, mild, moderate, and severe. Results??? Of 336 patients, 157 (46.7%) patients had a clinical concomitant TBI. Clinical TBI was classified as mild in 30.1%, moderate in 11.0% and severe in 5.7%. The average annual incidence increased from 3.3 per million in the first decade to 10.7 per million in the last. Alcohol was the strongest risk factor of clinical TBI (OR?=?3.69) followed by completeness of TSCI (OR?=?2.18). Conclusions??? The incidence of TSCI with concomitant TBI has increased during the last 50?years. Alcohol and completeness of injury are strong risk factors. Increased awareness of dual diagnoses is necessary.

AB  - Abstract Venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) increases the risk of mortality in trauma patients. To decrease the occurrence of VTE, low dose anticoagulants are commonly prescribed. This may be unacceptable in trauma patients who have a high risk of bleeding. Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters can be employed as an alternative strategy to decrease the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE). Insertion of an IVC filter is an invasive procedure that has a range of complications. The benefits of IVC filter insertion must be compared to its risk of complications in each individual patient. A search of the literature since 2005 was conducted on MEDLINE, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Embase. The clinical question posed was does prophylactic IVC filter insertion decrease the risk of PE in trauma patients? The available evidence was low level and unable to definitively answer this question. The majority of articles infer that IVC filter insertion is safe and may decrease the risk of PE. However, there is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to be conducted in this area.

AB  - Background and Objectives? Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa/NovoSeven?) has been advocated in the treatment of life-threatening haemorrhage, but appropriate clinical indications remain uncertain. The aim of this study was to detect factors predictive of outcome and to incorporate them into a prognostically significant scoring system. Materials and Methods? Thirty-six patients received rFVIIa for uncontrolled surgical, traumatic or obstetric bleeding in the Northern Region of the UK over a 45-month period. Clinical, laboratory and outcome data were examined. Characteristics of survivor and non-survivor groups were compared. A prognostic scoring system was evaluated retrospectively according to the presence of coagulopathy, renal impairment, hypothermia, greater than 10 units of red cell transfusion, advanced age and obstetric indication, with patients allocated to low, intermediate and high-risk groups. Results? Clinical response occurred in 26 patients (72%) with a reduction in prothrombin time and blood product requirements. Death occurred in 19 (53%). Four patients (11%) suffered thrombotic events. Survivors were younger than non-survivors and less likely to have coagulopathy, renal impairment or hypothermia at the time of administration. Survivors were more likely to have had an initial clinical response in terms of an immediate reduction in haemorrhage. Non-survivors were transfused a greater number of red cell units prior to administration. Survival varied according to prognostic score; low-risk patients had a survival rate of 85%, intermediate-risk patients had a survival rate of 50% and high-risk patients had a survival rate of 18%. Conclusions? FVIIa has a role in the cessation of haemorrhage, but may not improve survival. Use of a clinical scoring system may help to predict outcome.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective.? The application of continuous peripheral nerve block (CPNB) has been an important anesthetic tool in the management of combat soldiers wounded from current conflicts. Placing and maintaining CPNBs becomes a challenge in this patient population due to concomitant prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation. Case Report.? A 32-year-old male sustained multiple traumatic injuries from an improvised explosive device, including a right tibial fracture, a left tibial fracture, and a left ulnar fracture. His pain was originally well controlled with a left infraclavicular CPNB (0.2% ropivacaine at 10?mL/h with 3?mL bolus every 20 minutes) and an epidural (0.2% ropivacaine at 10?mL/h with 5?mL bolus every 30 minutes). He subsequently developed a common femoral vein thrombus and was treated with low-molecular-weight heparin. His epidural catheter was discontinued; however, his pain was not well controlled with intravenous and oral pain medication. We elected to place bilateral, tunneled sciatic CPNBs and a left, tunneled femoral CPNB. We started infusions of 0.2% ropivacaine at 10?mL/h in each catheter, in addition to 5?mL every 30 minutes demand dose in each sciatic catheter. The patient's serum ropivacaine levels were analyzed 24 hours after the start of the infusions and were found to be 5.8?mg/L and <0.1?mg/L for total and free concentrations, respectively. Conclusions.? This case highlights the application of simultaneous CPNB techniques in a patient with multiple extremity injuries receiving anticoagulant therapy.

AB  - Abstract. In order to define patients at high risk for inappropriate antibiotic treatment of bacteraemia, we compared 682 bacteraemic patients, treated with an antibiotic drug to which the infecting micro-organism was susceptible, with 419 patients who were inappropriately treated. On a multivariate logistic regression analysis including only clinical variables, four factors were found to be both significantly and independently associated with inappropriate antibiotic treatment: hospital-acquired bacteraemia (oddsratio (OR) of 1.9), antibiotic treatment in the month prior to the bacteraemia (OR 1.9), residence in a nursing home (OR 1.8), and the presence of a central line (OR 1.7). A second model, including bacteriological data, showed four micro-organisms to be independently associated with inappropriate antibiotic treatment: Candida sp. (OR 14.2), Acinetobacter sp. (OR 5.0), Enterococcus sp. (OR 3.6) and Pseudomonas sp. (OR 2.2). In this model, only two clinical features were included: hospital-acquired infection and previous antibiotic treatment. Special efforts should be made to improve empirical antibiotic treatment in the groups defined above, and to facilitate early laboratory diagnosis of the micro-organisms associated with inappropriate treatment.

AB  - Objective Plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (pNGAL) has been introduced as an early and sensitive biomarker of acute kidney injury (AKI), with an increased risk for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and adverse outcome in selected critically ill patient groups. Acute respiratory failure is the most common organ dysfunction in critically ill patients with an increased risk for AKI. Accordingly, we hypothesized that pNGAL would independently predict adverse outcome in a heterogeneous group of critically ill adult patients with acute respiratory failure. Design and Setting Prospective, multi-centre study in 25 Finnish intensive care units. Patients and Methods pNGAL was measured from critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure. We evaluated the predictive value of pNGAL for RRT, and hospital and 90-day mortality first separately, second in addition to the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II), and third to RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease) AKI classification. Additionally, we assessed the factors associated with pNGAL by linear regression analysis. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results We included 369 patients. Median (interquartile range) baseline pNGAL was 169 (92?370)?ng/ml. The areas under receiver operating characteristic curves of baseline pNGAL were as follows: 0.733 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.656?0.810] for RRT, 0.627 (95% CI 0.561?0.693) for hospital, and 0.582 (95% CI 0.520?0.645) for 90-day mortality. Present infection, baseline creatinine, operative status, and pancreatitis were independently associated with baseline pNGAL. Conclusions Baseline pNGAL gives no additional value into prediction of hospital and 90-day mortality compared with RIFLE or SAPS II, and has only moderate predictive power regarding RRT in critically ill adult patients with acute respiratory failure.

AB  - Summary What is known and Objective:? Literature provides much evidence regarding liposomal amphotericin B treatment for fungal infections in neonates and infants. Relevant data regarding critically ill paediatric patients of older age are scarce. We aimed to present our experience regarding liposomal amphotericin B use in critically ill paediatric patients from a tertiary-care paediatric hospital in Athens, Greece. Methods:? We prospectively identified all paediatric patients who received treatment with liposomal amphotericin B in the intensive care unit of a tertiary-care paediatric hospital during a 3-year period (2005?2008). Data were retrieved from the evaluation of the available medical records. Results and Discussion:? Twenty-three (nine females, mean age: 26·4?months, range: 5?39 months) critically ill paediatric patients were included; 12 had malignancy. In 16 of the 23 included children, liposomal amphotericin B was administered for the treatment of confirmed fungal infections (all but one were invasive), whereas in seven patients, it was used as pre-emptive treatment. One patient received voriconazole concomitantly. Eleven of the 16 children with documented infections were cured; five improved. Six of the seven children who received pre-emptive treatment also showed clinical improvement. Nine deaths were noted, all attributed to underlying diseases. Two cases of hepatotoxicity and one case of nephrotoxicity (all leading to drug-discontinuation) occurred. Seven and five cases of mild reversible hypokalaemia and hyponatraemia, respectively, were also noted. What is new and Conclusion:? According to the findings of our small case series, liposomal amphotericin B may provide a useful treatment option for fungal infections of vulnerable critically ill paediatric patients with considerable comorbidity.

AB  - Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment protocols have been introduced in the intensive care unit (ICU) to avoid secondary brain injury. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the deviations from such a treatment protocol and the frequency of extracranial complications, and relate these findings to outcome. Methods During a 5-year period (2004?2009), 133 patients with severe TBI [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score?≤?8] were prospectively included. The following deviations from treatment goals were studied: intracranial pressure (ICP), blood pressure, haemoglobin, blood glucose, serum sodium, serum albumin, body temperature and extracranial complications during the ICU stay. Outcome was assessed using Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score at 12 months. Results The frequencies of deviations from the treatment goals were: episodes of intracranial hypertension 69.5% (of monitored patients), hypotension 20.3%, anaemia 77.4%, hyperglycaemia 42.9%, hyponatremia 34.6%, hypoalbuminemia 30.8% and hyperthermia 54.9%. Pulmonary complications were common (pneumonia 72.2%, acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury 31.6%). Thrombocytopenia (4.5%), severe sepsis (3.0%), renal failure (0.8%) and liver failure (0.8%) were infrequent. Twenty-six (19.5%) patients died within the first 12 months due to the head injury. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, Injury Severity Score (ISS), ICP?>?25?mmHg, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome. Conclusions Deviations from the TBI treatment protocol were frequent. Pneumonia was the most frequent extracranial complication. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, ISS, high ICP, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome.

AB  - Abstract Purpose This study tested the effectiveness of a pressure ulcer (PU) prevention bundle in reducing the incidence of PUs in critically ill patients in two Saudi intensive care units (ICUs). Design A two-arm cluster randomized experimental control trial. Methods Participants in the intervention group received the PU prevention bundle, while the control group received standard skin care as per the local ICU policies. Data collected included demographic variables (age, diagnosis, comorbidities, admission trajectory, length of stay) and clinical variables (Braden Scale score, severity of organ function score, mechanical ventilation, PU presence, and staging). All patients were followed every two days from admission through to discharge, death, or up to a maximum of 28 days. Data were analyzed with descriptive correlation statistics, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and Poisson regression. Findings The total number of participants recruited was 140: 70 control participants (with a total of 728 days of observation) and 70 intervention participants (784 days of observation). PU cumulative incidence was significantly lower in the intervention group (7.14%) compared to the control group (32.86%). Poisson regression revealed the likelihood of PU development was 70% lower in the intervention group. The intervention group had significantly less Stage I (p = .002) and Stage II PU development (p = .026). Conclusions Significant improvements were observed in PU-related outcomes with the implementation of the PU prevention bundle in the ICU; PU incidence, severity, and total number of PUs per patient were reduced. Clinical Relevance Utilizing a bundle approach and standardized nursing language through skin assessment and translation of the knowledge to practice has the potential to impact positively on the quality of care and patient outcome.
