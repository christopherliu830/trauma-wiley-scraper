AB  - Abstract Objective This is an overview of the cellular biology of upper nasal mucosal cells that have special characteristics that enable them to be used to diagnose and study congenital neurological diseases and to aid neural repair. Study Design After mapping the distribution of neural cells in the upper nose, the authors' investigations moved to the use of olfactory neurones to diagnose neurological diseases of development, especially schizophrenia. Olfactory-ensheathing glial cells (OEGs) from the cranial cavity promote axonal penetration of the central nervous system and aid spinal cord repair in rodents. The authors sought to isolate these cells from the more accessible upper nasal cavity in rats and in humans and prove they could likewise promote neural regeneration, making these cells suitable for human spinal repair investigations. Methods The schizophrenia-diagnosis aspect of the study entailed the biopsy of the olfactory areas of 10 schizophrenic patients and 10 control subjects. The tissue samples were sliced and grown in culture medium. The ease of cell attachment to fibronectin (artificial epithelial basement membrane), as well as the mitotic and apoptotic indices, was studied in the presence and absence of dopamine in those cell cultures. The neural repair part of the study entailed a harvesting and insertion of first rat olfactory lamina propria rich in OEGs between cut ends of the spinal cords and then later the microinjection of an OEG-rich suspension into rat spinal cords previously transected by open laminectomy. Further studies were done in which OEG insertion was performed up to 1 month after rat cord transection and also in monkeys. Results Schizophrenic patients' olfactory tissues do not easily attach to basement membrane compared with control subjects, adding evidence to the theory that cell wall anomalies are part of the schizophrenic ?lesion? of neurones. Schizophrenic patient cell cultures had higher mitotic and apoptotic indices compared with control subjects. The addition of dopamine altered these indices enough to allow accurate differentiation of schizophrenics from control patients, leading to, possibly for the first time, an early objective diagnosis of schizophrenia and possible assessment of preventive strategies. OEGs from the nose were shown to be as effective as those from the olfactory bulb in promoting axonal growth across transected spinal cords even when added 1 month after injury in the rat. These otherwise paraplegic rats grew motor and proprioceptive and fine touch fibers with corresponding behavioral improvement. Conclusions The tissues of the olfactory mucosa are readily available to the otolaryngologist. Being surface cells, they must regenerate (called ?neurogenesis?). Biopsy of this area and amplification of cells in culture gives the scientist a ?window to the developing brain,? including early diagnosis of schizophrenia. The ?Holy Grail? of neurological disease is the cure of traumatic paraplegia and OEGs from the nose promote that repair. The otolaryngologist may become the necessary partner of the neurophysiologist and spinal surgeon to take the laboratory potential of paraplegic cure into the day-to-day realm of clinical reality.

AB  - Abstract Objective The study aimed to determine factors related to ICU mortality in critically ill patients transferred by Adult Retrieval Victoria (ARV) medical staff. Patients who died in ICU after interhospital transfer were compared against those who survived. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of ARV cases between 1 January 2009 and 30 June 2010. Retrieval data were linked with data from the ANZICS CORE APD (Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Centre for Outcome and Resource Evaluation Adult Patient Database). Victoria Data Linkage (VDL) performed linkage of data. Data included demographic and clinical data obtained during transfer and clinical data recorded in ICU. Results Of the 601 cases transferred by ARV during the study period, 549 cases were eligible for linkage to 25?543 ANZICS APD case records for the same period. VDL matched 460 of these cases (83.8%). Mortality rate in the matched sample was 13.9%. Variables associated with mortality were: advanced age (odds ratios [OR] 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00?1.04, P = 0.02), principal referral problem cardiac (OR 1.84, 95%CI 1.02?3.32, P = 0.04), lower mean arterial blood pressure (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95?0.99, P = 0.005) and tachycardia (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00?1.03, P = 0.008) on arrival at destination hospital. Conclusions Advanced age, lower mean arterial blood pressure and tachycardia towards the completion of transfer were associated with increased ICU mortality in this population. Clinicians should be aware of the additional risk for cardiac patients.

AB  - ABSTRACT TRAUMA IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH for people younger than age 45 in the United States. To help prevent death or disability, critically in jured trauma patients must reach definitive care within the ?golden hour.? OFTEN, THE PERIOPERATIVE TEAM has no more than 10 minutes to prepare the room before a patient who has suffered multiple, critical, traumatic injuries is rushed into the OR. FOR THE TRAUMA PATIENT'S SAFETY, the perioperative team must be diligent and use creative measures to efficiently ensure that all surgical counts are completed. Foregoing surgical counts places the trauma patient at an increased risk for unintentionally retained foreign objects.

AB  - Abstract The aim was to evaluate the effect of HTK compared to UW and Euro?Collins (EC) on the initial graft function and long term graft survival in two prospective randomized studies. Only kidneys from heart-beating, kidney-only or kidney + heart donors were eligible for entry. Initial non-function (INF) was defined as the absence of life-sustaining renal function, requiring dialysis treatment on two or more occasions, during the first week after transplantation. To evaluate the contribution of the preservation solutions on INF in relation to other factors, a multivariate, 2-step logistic regression model was used. Randomization was performed between July 1990 and September 1992. The UW-HTK study comprised 342 donors and 611 transplants (UW: 168 donors and 297 transplants, HTK: 174 donors and 314 transplants). In the EC-HTK study 317 donors and 569 transplants were included (EC: 155 donors and 277 transplants, HTK: 162 donors and 292 transplants). INF occurred in 33 % of either HTK-(n = 105) or UW-(n= 99) preserved kidneys (P = NS), and in 29% of the HTK-(n= 85) and in 43% of the EC-(n= 119) preserved kidneys (P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed no significant influence of the preservation solution on the incidence of INF in the UW-HTK study, but factors contributing to INF were donor age, cause of death, retransplantation, and cold ischemic period. The EC-HTK study showed a significantly higher risk of INF, using EC as preservation, in addition to cold ischemic period and donor quality. The 3-year graft survival of HTK-preserved kidneys was 73 %, compared to 68 % for UW?preserved kidneys in the UW-HTK study (P = NS); while the 3-year graft survival of HTK preserved kidneys was 70 % compared to 67 % for EC-preserved kidneys in the EC-HTK study (P = NS). We can conclude that HTK is comparable to UW in its preservative abilities, using kidneys from heart-beating kidney-only donors, whereas EC as renal preservation solution should be avoided.

AB  - SUMMARY Hemorrhage due to elective or emergency surgery results in significant patient morbidity and mortality and consumption of scarce transfusion resources. Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has been proposed as a universal hemostatic agent which may be beneficial in reducing blood loss and in treating unexpected massive hemorrhage in surgical patients. In elective surgery, a small number of randomized studies have shown a limited benefit for rFVIIa in the reduction of transfusion requirements. In massive hemorrhage associated with surgery, two case series and a growing number of case reports suggest that rFVIIa is successful as salvage therapy. However, a number of questions remain regarding the optimal dose, the true rate of thromboembolic complications and the overall survival and cost benefit when rFVIIa is used for this indication. In this review, the role of rFVIIa in managing blood loss in surgical patients is assessed in the light of current evidence.

AB  - Supplementation of enteral nutritional formulas and parenteral nutrition lipid emulsions with omega-3 fatty acids is a recent area of research in patients with critical illness. It is hypothesized that omega-3 fatty acids may help reduce inflammation in critically ill patients, particularly those with sepsis and acute lung injury. The objective of this article is to review the data on supplementing omega-3 fatty acids during critical illness; enteral and parenteral supplemental nutrition are reviewed separately. The results of the research available to date are contradictory for both enteral and parenteral omega-3 fatty acid administration. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may influence the acute inflammatory response in critically ill patients, but more research is needed before definitive recommendations about the routine use of omega-3 fatty acids in caring for critically ill patients can be made.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that exogenous protein/amino acid supplementation has the potential to improve the recovery of critically ill patients. After a careful review of the published evidence, experts have concluded that critically ill patients should receive up to 2.0?2.5 g/kg/d of protein. Despite this, however, recent review of current International Nutrition Survey data suggests that protein in critically ill patients is underprescribed and grossly underdelivered. Furthermore, the survey suggests that most of protein administration comes from enteral nutrition (EN) despite the availability of products and protocols that enhance the delivery of protein/amino acids in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. While future research clarifies the dose, timing, and composition for exogenous protein administration, as well as identification of patients who will benefit the most, ongoing process improvement initiatives should target a concerted effort to increase protein intake in the critically ill. This assertion follows from the notion that current patients are possibly being harmed while we wait for confirmatory evidence. Further research should also develop better tools to enable bedside practitioners to monitor optimal or adequate protein intake for individual patients. Finally, exploring the effect of combining adequate protein delivery with early mobility and/or resistance exercise in the ICU setting has the greatest potential for improving the functional outcomes of survivors of critical illness and warrants further study.

AB  - Summary The cervical spine is approached in two separate anatomic and functional regions: the craniocervical junction (occiput, C1 and C2) and the subaxial spine (C3 to C7). Injury to the craniocervical junction or cervical spine trauma is usually indirect, related to forces transmitted through the head. Current recommendations for initial imaging in adults with suspected cervical spine injury is a thin slice CT of the cervical spine. The most common fracture of C1 is a bilateral vertical fracture through the neural arch. Fractures of C2 may occur in isolation or in association with additional cervical spine fractures. The most common fracture of C2 involves the odontoid, followed by Hangman's fracture, anteroinferior endplate (hyperextension teardrop) and least commonly, isolated C2 body or posterior element fractures. A burst fracture commonly results from combined axial loading and flexion vector in C5, C6, and C7 locations. Compression fractures are common in elderly patients with osteoporosis.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of acquired disability globally, and effective treatment methods are scarce. Lately, there has been increasing recognition of the devastating impact of TBI resulting from sports and other recreational activities, ranging from primarily sport-related concussions (SRC) but also more severe brain injuries requiring hospitalization. There are currently no established treatments for the underlying pathophysiology in TBI and while neuro-rehabilitation efforts are promising, there are currently is a lack of consensus regarding rehabilitation following TBI of any severity. In this narrative review, we highlight short- and long-term consequences of SRCs, and how the sideline management of these patients should be performed. We also cover the basic concepts of neuro-critical care management for more severely brain-injured patients with a focus on brain oedema and the necessity of improving intracranial conditions in terms of substrate delivery in order to facilitate recovery and improve outcome. Further, following the acute phase, promising new approaches to rehabilitation are covered for both patients with severe TBI and athletes suffering from SRC. These highlight the need for co-ordinated interdisciplinary rehabilitation, with a special focus on cognition, in order to promote recovery after TBI.

AB  - Summary Traumatic injuries to the musculoskeletal system are extremely common. These injuries are among the short list of medical disorders that may be completely resolved if recognized and appropriately treated. Radiologists have an important role in the diagnosis. In order to identify the abnormality and characterize it correctly, it is essential to be familiar with normal anatomy, protocols for imaging tests, patterns of injury, and implement an organized approach to image interpretation. The American College of Radiology (ACR) devised guidelines for selecting the appropriate imaging test in a patient who sustained musculoskeletal trauma. This chapter deals with different imaging tests, including radiographs, Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, bone scintigraphy and ultrasound. The radiology report needs to be concise, yet include relevant information required for effective clinical management. It is important to be familiar with common fracture classification systems and understand how different grades of injury potentially affect treatment.
