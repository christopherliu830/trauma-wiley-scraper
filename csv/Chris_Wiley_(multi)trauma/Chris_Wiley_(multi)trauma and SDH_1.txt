AB  - Allergic skin diseases are amongst the most common reasons for the presentation of dogs and cats to a veterinarian. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of similarity in the clinical signs associated with these diseases. In this article, the role of intradermal and serological allergy testing in the diagnosis and management of allergic skin diseases is reviewed, together with other diagnostic approaches.

AB  - Abstract Subdural haemorrhage (SDH) in infants arises most commonly from non-accidental head injury (NAHI) from shaking. Patients present with a varied severity of illness and a variety of symptoms and signs. Data on long-term outcome of the survivors are not widely reported. The aim of this paper is to describe the physical and educational outcomes of children <2 years diagnosed with non-accidental head injury and formulate guidelines on follow-up. Data on 65 children <2 years with non-accidental head injury and subdural haemorrhage diagnosed on CT/MRI/postmortem were extracted from the hospital and community notes and education reports. The Kings Outcome Scale for Childhood Head Injury (KOSCHI) was used. Sixteen children died (24.6%), 13 within 6 weeks and three 5 years after the injury. Of the 45 children followed up (follow-up time 21.7?103 months), 25 had a good outcome, six were moderately disabled and 11 were severely disabled, while three were in persistent vegetative state. Problems identi?ed included cerebral palsy?16, ongoing seizures?5, visual problems?11, speech and language problems?17 and behavioural problems?13. Of the 29 children of school age on whom data were available, 12 children had a statement of educational needs. In conclusion, young children who survive non-accidental head injury can have signi?cant physical, cognitive and behavioural problems. Regular follow-up by a multidisciplinary team, which includes a community paediatrician, therapists, school health personnel and ophthalmologic services, until the child is established in school may facilitate early identi?cation of emerging problems and optimize management. Care must be taken not to discharge children with good outcomes, as behavioural and cognitive problems can emerge with time. Only a prospective study will help outline the subtle problems that can emerge with time in children with a so-called good outcome. Copyright ? 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract The incidence of chronic wounds is increased among older adults, and the impact of chronic wounds on quality of life is particularly profound in this population. It is well established that wound healing slows with age. However, the basic biology underlying chronic wounds and the influence of age-associated changes on wound healing are poorly understood. Most studies have used in vitro approaches and various animal models, but observed changes translate poorly to human healing conditions. The impact of age and accompanying multi-morbidity on the effectiveness of existing and emerging treatment approaches for chronic wounds is also unknown, and older adults tend to be excluded from randomized clinical trials. Poorly defined outcomes and variables, lack of standardization in data collection, and variations in the definition, measurement, and treatment of wounds also hamper clinical studies. The Association of Specialty Professors, in conjunction with the National Institute on Aging and the Wound Healing Society, held a workshop, summarized in this paper, to explore the current state of knowledge and research challenges, engage investigators across disciplines, and identify key research questions to guide future study of age-associated changes in chronic wound healing.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing the study: Intestinal hyperammonaemia (HA) has been infrequently reported in individual horses; however, there have been no studies describing clinical and laboratory data as well as short- and long-term outcome in a larger number of cases. Objectives: To describe clinical and laboratory data and short- and long-term outcome in a large group of horses with intestinal HA. Methods: Multi-centred, retrospective study; case records of horses with HA were reviewed and any horse with a clinical or post mortem diagnosis of intestinal HA was included. Hyperammonaemia was defined as a blood ammonium (NH4+) concentration ≥60?µmol/l and horses with a diagnosis of primary hepatic disease were excluded. Relevant data were recorded and, if appropriate, data from survivors were compared to nonsurvivors to identify potential prognostic indicators. Results: Thirty-six cases, 26 mature horses and 10 foals with intestinal HA were identified. Case histories included diarrhoea, colic and neurological signs and the most common clinical diagnosis was colitis and/or enteritis. The most common clinical and laboratory abnormalities included tachycardia, increased packed cell volume, hyperlactataemia and hyperglycaemia. Fourteen horses (39%) survived to discharge; NH4+ concentration on admission was the only parameter significantly associated with survival. All surviving horses and foals for which follow-up information was available recovered completely and returned to their intended use without further complications. Conclusions and potential relevance: Intestinal HA occurs in mature horses and foals and can be associated with severe clinical and laboratory abnormalities; further studies are required to investigate predisposing factors and delineate possible differences in aetiologies.

AB  - Summary.? The incidence of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) in newborns with haemophilia is unknown. Retrospective studies, estimate the incidence to be around 3%. Because of this uncertainty, we analysed the largest inpatient database in the USA, the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), to better approximate the incidence of ICH in these patients. ICD-9 coding data were used to reference NIS entries of haemophilia (A, B or C) or von Willebrand?s disease (VWD), with intraventricular (IVH), subarachnoid (SAH), subdural (SDH) and/or intraparenchymal (IPH) haemorrhage. Of 9.2???107 hospitalizations from 1988 to 2001, 11% or 1???107 were newborns. Of these, 0.00527%, or 580 were diagnosed with haemophilia or VWD. Twenty of 580, or 3.4%, experienced an ICH. The ICH rate in non-haemophilic newborns was 0.11% (P value: <0.0001). The rate of ICH among term haemophilic newborns without sepsis, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or congenital heart disease (CHD), delivered without vacuum assist was 1.9%. One death occurred on the day of birth in a term neonate with haemophilia C. The mean length of stay for ICH patients with haemophilia was 28?days (median 28, range: 6?143?days). The mean hospital charges for the group were $102?072 (median $67?551, range: $9624?467?132). These data add credence to the estimates of ICH in haemophilic newborns and may guide treatment strategies around the time of their birth. Further, uncomplicated delivery of term, otherwise healthy haemophilic newborns may carry a lesser risk of ICH.

AB  - Summary The brain and other parts of the nervous system undergo complex changes with age. Loss of brain weight and volume, changes in neurons and synapses, and oxidative, inflammatory, and biochemical changes have all been described in the aging brain. Moreover, the aging brain and nervous system show an increased vulnerability to a variety of distinct pathologies, particularly degenerative and vascular. This chapter provides an overview of the neuropathology of the aging brain, including ?normal? aging, the pathology of cognitive impairment and dementia, movements disorders, brain tumors, vascular disease, motor impairments, and other common geriatric brain conditions, such as toxic metabolic conditions, neoplasms, infections, and traumatic injury that may affect the elderly. The section on cognitive impairment and dementia explains the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mixed dementias, vascular dementia (also known as vascular cognitive impairment), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the role of glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in probiotics while also referring to other moonlighting proteins as the need arises. Probiotics do not produce toxic substances such as ammonia, indole, phenol, and nitrosamine, while probiotics can assimilate ammonia, inhibit the growth of toxic-substance-producing bacteria such as Escherichia coli, and adsorb and eliminate these substances. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) is one of the best-studied probiotic strains and many beneficial effects have been reported. LGG has been commercialized and consumed in a wide variety of food products and dietary supplements throughout the world for long time. Most reports about the multiple moonlighting functions of surface GAPDH in probiotics refer to adhesins. GAPDH has multi-binding properties. GAPDH may relate to stress response because some reports show expression of moonlighting proteins such as GAPDH increase under various stress conditions.

AB  - Epidemiological studies have identified a history of head injury as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. However, the neuropathological mechanism underlying this relationship is as yet unclear. Neuronal cytoskeletal changes in the form of neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads have recently been demonstrated in young men who had sustained repetitive head injury and subsequently died in their 20s. In addition, recent experimental studies have found accumulation of tau within neuronal somata and damaged axons following diffuse brain injury. We hypothesized that tau-immunoreactive tangles may be present in the brains of patients who died after a single acute blunt head injury. A total of 45 cases of fatal head injury were immunostained for tau. They comprised nine groups (n?=?5 for each group) separated by age (0?19?years, 20?50?years, 50?+?years) and survival time (<?24?h, 24?h?1?week, 1?week?1?month) and were compared with age-matched controls. Subtle alterations in tau immunoreactivity, for example, in oligodendrocytes, were present in some head injury cases but not controls. However, neurofibrillary tangles did not appear more prevalent after traumatic brain injury (TBI) when compared with age-matched controls. Although alterations in tau immunoreactivity may occur which warrant further study, neurofibrillary tangles were not more prevalent after a single fatal episode of TBI.

AB  - ABSTRACT Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been associated with diminished bone mineral density (BMD) and an increased risk of fracture; however, prior studies have not yielded consistent results, and many have suboptimal ascertainment of both PPI use and BMD. We used data from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), a multicenter, multi-ethnic, community-based longitudinal cohort study of women across the menopause transition to examine the association between annualized BMD changes and new use of PPIs. We compared changes in BMD in new PPI users with changes in BMD in new users of histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and with changes in BMD in subjects who did not use either class of medications. Mixed linear regression models included recognized risk factors for osteoporosis, including demographics, menopausal transition stage, body mass index (BMI), lifestyle factors, as well as comorbidities and concomitant medications. To provide further evidence for the validity of our analytic approach, we also examined the effects of hormone-replacement therapy (HT), a class of medications that should reduce bone loss, on changes in BMD as an internal positive control group. We identified 207 new users of PPIs, 185 new users of H2RAs, and 1,676 non-users. Study subjects had a mean age of 50 years and were followed for a median of 9.9 years. Adjusted models found no difference in the annualized BMD change at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip in PPI users compared with H2RA users or non-users. These results were robust to sensitivity analyses. BMD increased as expected in HT users, supporting the validity of our study design. These longitudinal analyses plus similar prior studies argue against an association between PPI use and BMD loss. ? 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - 1 Tallie Z. Baram, 1 Kristen L. Brunson, 1 Celine Dube, 1 Sarit Avishai-Eliner, and 1 Kristina A. Fenoglio ( 1 Pediatrics, Anatomy/ Neurobiology, UCI, Irvine, CA ) Seizures often arise in the setting of an acute injury or insult. In addition, many of the epilepsies are ?symptomatic?, i.e., they occur in individuals who had sustained injury or insult such as infection, trauma, or stroke. The mechanisms by which diverse factors such as infection or trauma provoke both acute seizures and recurrent, chronic seizures (epilepsy) are not fully understood. To some extent, each of these insults may initiate a unique chain of events that promotes epilepsy. However, these insults also share commonalities that set in motion cellular and molecular changes that promote neuronal hyperexcitability: All these epilepsy- provoking insults are stressful, in that they trigger the release and actions of ?stress-mediating molecules?, including glucocorticoids and the intrinsic central nervous system (CNS) stress-activated neuro-peptide, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). Stress induces release of CRH from hippocampal interneurons, and CRH acts on selective receptors (CRF-R1) to enhance glutamate-mediated neurotransmission. In immature hippocampus, CRH and the CRH receptors are particularly abundant, so that the peptide may excite neurons sufficiently to evoke seizures, followed by dendritic atrophy or death of vulnerable neurons. In animal models, chronic enhancement of CRH levels within the developing hippocampus, may result in enduring reduction of hippocampus- governed learning and memory function. Such levels might be found in infants with chronic CNS stressors including congenital infection, dysplasia, trauma or recurrent seizures. Indeed, drugs that downregulate CRH levels in limbic structures (e.g., ACTH) are potent antiepileptics in the developing CNS. In summary, acute and chronic stress elicits the release of pro-excitatory molecules (CRH), promoting seizures. These further activate the ?stress response?, leading to a vicious cycle culminating in loss of neuronal function and integrity.

AB  - Summary Purpose Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children, and early posttraumatic seizures (EPTS) are a contributing factor to ongoing acute damage. Continuous video-EEG monitoring (cEEG) was utilized to assess the burden of clinical and electrographic EPTS. Methods Eighty-seven consecutive, unselected (mild ? severe), acute TBI patients requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission at two academic centers were monitored prospectively with cEEG per established clinical TBI protocols. Clinical and subclinical seizures and status epilepticus (SE, clinical and subclinical) were assessed for their relation to clinical risk factors and short-term outcome measures. Key Findings Of all patients, 42.5% (37/87) had seizures. Younger age (p = 0.002) and injury mechanism (abusive head trauma ? AHT, p < 0.001) were significant risk factors. Subclinical seizures occurred in 16.1% (14/87), while 6.9% (6/87) had only subclinical seizures. Risk factors for subclinical seizures included younger age (p < 0.001), AHT (p < 0.001), and intraaxial bleed (p < 0.001). SE occurred in 18.4% (16/87) with risk factors including younger age (p < 0.001), AHT (p < 0.001), and intraaxial bleed (p = 0.002). Subclinical SE was detected in 13.8% (12/87) with significant risk factors including younger age (p < 0.001), AHT (p = 0.001), and intraaxial bleed (p = 0.004). Subclinical seizures were associated with lower discharge King's Outcome Scale for Childhood Head Injury (KOSCHI) score (p = 0.002). SE and subclinical SE were associated with increased hospital length of stay (p = 0.017 and p = 0.041, respectively) and lower hospital discharge KOSCHI (p = 0.007 and p = 0.040, respectively). Significance cEEG monitoring significantly improves detection of seizures/SE and is the only way to detect subclinical seizures/SE. cEEG may be indicated after pediatric TBI, particularly in younger children, AHT cases, and those with intraaxial blood on computerized tomography (CT).

AB  - Abstract M-type (KCNQ2/3) K+ channels play dominant roles in regulation of active and passive neuronal discharge properties such as resting membrane potential, spike-frequency adaptation, and hyper-excitatory states. However, plasticity of M-channel expression and function in nongenetic forms of epileptogenesis are still not well understood. Using transgenic mice with an EGFP reporter to detect expression maps of KCNQ2 mRNA, we assayed hyperexcitability-induced alterations in KCNQ2 transcription across subregions of the hippocampus. Pilocarpine and pentylenetetrazol chemoconvulsant models of seizure induction were used, and brain tissue examined 48?hr later. We observed increases in KCNQ2 mRNA in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons after chemoconvulsant-induced hyperexcitability at 48?hr, but no significant change was observed in dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells. Using chromogenic in situ hybridization assays, changes to KCNQ3 transcription were not detected after hyper-excitation challenge, but the results for KCNQ2 paralleled those using the KCNQ2-mRNA reporter mice. In mice 7?days after pilocarpine challenge, levels of KCNQ2 mRNA were similar in all regions to those from control mice. In brain-slice electrophysiology recordings, CA1 pyramidal neurons demonstrated increased M-current amplitudes 48?hr after hyperexcitability; however, there were no significant changes to DG granule cell M-current amplitude. Traumatic brain injury induced significantly greater KCNQ2 expression in the hippocampal hemisphere that was ipsilateral to the trauma. In vivo, after a secondary challenge with subconvulsant dose of pentylenetetrazole, control mice were susceptible to tonic?clonic seizures, whereas mice administered the M-channel opener retigabine were protected from such seizures. This study demonstrates that increased excitatory activity promotes KCNQ2 upregulation in the hippocampus in a cell-type specific manner. Such novel ion channel expressional plasticity may serve as a compensatory mechanism after a hyperexcitable event, at least in the short term. The upregulation described could be potentially leveraged in anticonvulsant enhancement of KCNQ2 channels as therapeutic target for preventing onset of epileptogenic seizures.

AB  - Summary Sutcliffia insignis was a large stem, probably of considerable height, the surface clothed by spirally arranged leaf-bases of great size relative to the stem. The vascular system of the stem consisted of a single main stele with solid wood (protostele), from which meristeles or subsidiary steles were given off. The meristeles divided up, the branches of adjacent meristeles sometimes fusing with one another, and gave rise to the numerous leaf-trace bundles. The xylem in all parts of the vascular system was exarch, and consisted of tracheides interspersed with xylem-parenchyma. The walls of the larger tracheides bore multi-seriate bordered pits. The formation of secondary wood and bast had begun to a small extent around the stele and some of the meristeles. The phloem of the stele and meristeles consisted of strands of narrow elements (sieve-tubes) embedded in parenchyma. In the bundles of the leaf-bases and petioles numerous large phloem-elements, probably of the nature of sieve-tubes, were present. The pericycle and cortex were traversed by secretory canals. The leaf-bases and detached petioles were of similar structure, the hypoderma having radially arranged sclerotic bands as in Myeloxylon; other sclerotic strands traversed the ground-tissue. The foliar bundles, which were present in great numbers in the petiole, were in all cases of concentric structure.

AB  - ABSTRACT Usage of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in the management of acute and chronic wounds has grown exponentially in the past decade. Hundreds of studies have been published regarding outcomes and methods of therapy used for adult wounds. This treatment is increasingly being used to manage difficult-to-treat paediatric wounds arising from congenital defects, trauma, infection, tumour, burns, pressure ulceration and postsurgical complications in children, although relatively few studies have been aimed at this population. Given the anatomical and physiological differences between adults and children, a multidisciplinary expert advisory panel was convened to determine appropriate use of NPWT with reticulated open cell foam (NPWT/ROCF) as delivered by Vacuum Assisted Closure? (V.A.C.? Therapy, KCI Licensing, Inc., San Antonio, TX) for the treatment of paediatric wounds. The primary objectives of the expert advisory panel were to exchange state-of-practice information on paediatric wound care, review the published data regarding the use of NPWT/ROCF in paediatric wounds, evaluate the strength of the existing data and establish guidelines on best practices with NPWT/ROCF for the paediatric population. The proposed paediatrics-specific clinical practice guidelines are meant to provide practitioners an evidence base from which decisions could be made regarding the safe and efficacious selection of pressure settings, foam type, dressing change frequency and use of interposing contact layer selections. The guidelines reflect the state of knowledge on effective and appropriate wound care at the time of publication. They are the result of consensus reached by expert advisory panel members based on their individual clinical and published experiences related to the use of NPWT/ROCF in treating paediatric wounds. Best practices are described herein for novice and advanced users of NPWT/ROCF. Recommendations by the expert panel may not be appropriate for use in all circumstances. Decisions to adopt any particular recommendation must be made by the collaborating medical team, including the surgeon and wound care specialist based on available resources, individual patient circumstances and experience with the V.A.C.? Therapy System.

AB  - Abstract Age-based differences in fall type and neuroanatomy in infants and toddlers may affect clinical presentations and injury patterns. Objective Our goal is to understand the influence of fall type and age on injuries to help guide clinical evaluation. Design/Setting/Participants Retrospectively, 285 children 0?48 months with accidental head injury from a fall and brain imaging between 2000 and 2006 were categorized by age (infan ≤ 1 year and toddler = 1?4 years) and fall type: low (≤3 ft), intermediate (>3 and <10 ft), high height falls (≥10 ft) and stair falls. Outcome Measures Clinical manifestations were noted and head injuries separated into primary (bleeding) and secondary (hypoxia, edema). The influence of age and fall type on head injuries sustained was evaluated. Results Injury patterns in children <4 years varied with age. Despite similar injury severity scores, infants sustained more skull fractures than toddlers (71% vs. 39%). Of children with skull fractures, 11% had no evidence of scalp/facial soft tissue swelling. Of the patients with primary intracranial injury, 30% had no skull fracture and 8% had neither skull fracture nor cranial soft tissue injury. Low height falls resulted in primary intracranial injury without soft tissue or skull injury in infants (6%) and toddlers (16%). Conclusions Within a given fall type, age-related differences in injuries exist between infants and toddlers. When interpreting a fall history, clinicians must consider the fall type and influence of age on resulting injury. For young children, intracranial injury is not always accompanied by external manifestations of their injury.
