AB  - Abstract:? Background:? The impact of newer immunosuppressive and antimicrobial prophylactic agents on the pattern of infectious complications following kidney transplantation has not been well studied. Methods:? This is an observational study in 127 adult recipients transplanted from 2001 to 2004. Patients received thymoglobulin (ATG) (50%) or basiliximab (50%) for induction and were maintained on mycophenolate mofetil, either tacrolimus (73%) or sirolimus (SRL) (27%), and prednisone (79%). Antimicrobial prophylaxis included perioperative cefazolin, trimethoprim/sulfamethaxazole for six?months, valganciclovir for three?months and nystatin for two?months. Regression models were used to examine the association of various factors with infections. Results:? We observed 127 infections in 65 patients, consisting of urinary tract infection (UTI) (47%), viral infections (17%), pneumonia (8%) and surgical wound infections (7%). UTI was the most common infection in all post-transplant periods. Enterococcus spp. (33%) and Escherichia coli (21%) were the most prevalent uropathogens. Of six patients with cytomegalovirus infection, none had tissue-invasive disease. There were no cases of pneumocystis pneumonia or BK nephropathy. Six patients developed fungal infections. Two deaths due to disseminated Rhizopus and Candida albicans accounted for a 1.5% infection-related mortality. Retransplantation and ureteral stents were independently associated with UTI (OR?=?4.5 and 2.9, p?=?0.06 and 0.03, respectively), as were ATG and SRL with bacterial infections (OR?=?3.3 and 2.5, p?=?0.009 and 0.047, respectively). Conclusion:? This study suggests that the use of newer immunosuppressive agents in recent years is associated with some changes in the epidemiology of post-transplant infections. Enterococci have become the predominant uropathogen. Invasive fungal infections, although rare, are often fatal.

AB  - Abstract Ultrastructure of the medium sized ?spiny? neuron in rat dorsal-lateral caudate-putamen was assessed after administration of 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) and exposure to pulsed microwaves. Sprague?Dawley male rats were given two daily intraperitoneal doses of 0 or 10 mg/kg 3-NP and 1.5 h after each dose were exposed to microwave radiation at a whole body averaged specific absorption rate (SAR) of 0 (sham exposure), 0.6, or 6 W/kg for 30 min. Microwave exposure consisted of 1.25 GHz radiation delivered as 5.9 ?s pulses with repetition frequency 10 Hz. Tissue samples taken 2?3 h after the second sham or microwave exposure showed no injury with light microscope methods. Blinded qualitative assessment of ultrastructure of randomly selected neurons from the same samples did reveal differences. Subsequent detailed, quantitative measurements showed that, when followed by sham exposure, administration of 3-NP significantly increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) intracisternal width, ER area density, and nuclear envelope thickness. Microwave exposure at 6 W/kg alone also significantly increased these measures. Exposure of 3-NP treated animals at 6 W/kg significantly increased effects of 3-NP on ultrastructure. Although exposure at 0.6 W/kg alone did not affect ultrastructure measures, exposure of 3-NP treated animals at 0.6 W/kg reduced the effects of 3-NP. We concluded that 3-NP changed neuronal ultrastructure and that the microwave exposures used here changed neuronal ultrastructure in ways that depended on microwave SAR and neuron metabolic status. The apparent cancellation of 3-NP induced changes by exposure to pulsed microwaves at 0.6 W/kg indicated the possibility that such exposure can protect against the effects of mitochondrial toxins on the nervous system.

AB  - Antidisialosyl antibodies have been previously associated to chronic and acute ataxic neuropathies. We studied the presence of these antibodies in nine patients with acute self-limiting ataxic neuropathy (ASLAN) using ELISA and TLC immunodetection. One patient showed serum IgG immunoreactivity against gangliosides GD3 and GQlb. The patient's IgG was able to bind to the nodes of Ranvier on frozen human dorsal root. Our studies confirmed that antidisialosyl reactivity is associated to ataxic neuropathy and its specific binding to the dorsal root could explain the predominant sensory involvement. Nevertheless, the low incidence of this reactivity indicates that a different pathogenic mechanism should be involved in most ASLAN patients.

AB  - Sepsis may cause not only failure of parenchymal organs but can also cause damage to peripheral nerves and skeletal muscles. It is now recognized that sepsis-mediated disorders of the peripheral nerves and the muscle, called critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) and critical illness myopathy, are responsible for weakness and muscle atrophy occurring de novo in intensively treated patients. CIP represents an acute axonal neuropathy that develops during treatment of severely ill patients and remits spontaneously, once the critical condition is under control. The course is monophasic and self-limiting. Among the critical illness myopathies, three main types have been identified: a nonnecrotizing ?cachectic? myopathy (critical illness myopathy in the strict sense), a myopathy with selective loss of myosin filaments (?thick filament myopathy?) and an acute necrotizing myopathy of intensive care. Clinical manifestations of both critical illness myopathies and CIP include delayed weaning from the respirator, muscle weakness, and prolonging of the mobilization phase. The pathogenesis of these neuromuscular complications of sepsis is not understood in detail but most authors assume that the inflammatory factors that mediate systemic inflammatory response and multiple organ failure are closely involved. In thick filament myopathy and acute necrotizing myopathy, administration of steroids and neuromuscular blocking agents may act as triggers. Specific therapies have not been discovered. Stabilization of the underlying critical condition and elimination of sepsis appear to be of major importance. Steroids and muscle relaxants should be avoided or administered at the lowest dose possible.

AB  - There is a growing body of evidence that sensory neuropathy in diabetes is associated with abnormal calcium signaling in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Enhanced influx of calcium via multiple high-threshold calcium currents is present in sensory neurons of several models of diabetes mellitus, including the spontaneously diabetic BioBred/Worchester (BB/W) rat and the chemical streptozotocin (STZ)-induced rat. We believe that abnormal calcium signaling in diabetes has pathologic significance as elevation of calcium influx and cytosolic calcium release has been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions characterized by neuronal dysfunction and death. Using electrophysiologic and pharmacologic techniques, the present study provides evidence that significant impairment of G-protein-coupled modulation of calcium channel function may underlie the enhanced calcium entry in diabetes. N- and P-type voltage-activated, high-threshold calcium channels in DRGs are coupled to mu opiate receptors via inhibitory G(o)-type G proteins. The responsiveness of this receptor coupled model was tested in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from spontaneously-diabetic BB/W rats, and streptozotocin-induced (STZ) diabetic rats. Intracellular dialysis with GTPgammaS decreased calcium current amplitude in diabetic BB/W DRG neurons compared with those of age-matched, nondiabetic controls, suggesting that inhibitory G-protein activity was diminished in diabetes, resulting in larger calcium currents. Facilitation of calcium current density (I(DCa)) by large-amplitude depolarizing prepulses (proposed to transiently inactivate G proteins), was significantly less effective in neurons from BB/W and STZ-induced diabetic DRGs. Facilitation was enhanced by intracellular dialysis with GTPgammaS, decreased by pertussis toxin, and abolished by GDPbetaS within 5 min. Direct measurement of GTPase activity using opiate-mediated GTPgamma[(35)S] binding, confirmed that G-protein activity was significantly diminished in STZ-induced diabetic neurons compared with age-matched nondiabetic controls. Diabetes did not alter the level of expression of mu opiate receptors and G-protein alpha subunits. These studies indicate that impaired regulation of calcium channels by G proteins is an important mechanism contributing to enhanced calcium influx in diabetes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: A precocious detection of cardiac autonomic dysfunction is of major clinical interest that could lead to a more intensive supervision of diabetic patients. However, classical clinical exploration of cardiac autonomic function is not easy to undertake in a reproducible way. Thus, respective interests of autonomic nervous parameters provided by both clinical tests and computerized analysis of resting blood pressure were checked in type 1 diabetic patients without orthostatic hypotension and microalbuminuria. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirteen diabetic subjects matched for age and gender to thirteen healthy subjects volunteered to participate to the study. From clinical tests (standing up, deep breathing, Valsalva maneuver, handgrip test), autonomic function was scored according to Ewing's methodology. Analysis of resting beat to beat blood pressure provided autonomic indices of the cardiac function (spectral analysis or Z analysis). RESULTS: 5 of the 13 diabetic patients exhibited a pathological score (more than one pathological response) suggesting the presence of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. The most discriminative test was the deep breathing test. However, spectral indices of BP recordings and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) of these 5 subjects were similar to those of healthy subjects and of remaining diabetic subjects. CONCLUSION: Alteration in Ewing's score given by clinical tests may not reflect an alteration of cardiac autonomic function in asymptomatic type I diabetic patients, because spectral indices of sympathetic and parasympathetic (including BRS) function were within normal range. Our results strongly suggest to confront results provided by both methodologies before concluding to an autonomic cardiac impairment in asymptomatic diabetic patients.

AB  - The role of chronic hyperglycemia in the development of diabetic microvascular complications and in neuropathy has been clearly established by intervention studies. However, the biochemical or cellular links between elevated blood glucose levels, and the vascular lesions remain incompletely understood. This review focuses on the consequences of hyperglycemia on the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), and on the role of AGEs and of their specific receptors (RAGE) in the functional and anatomical alterations of the vascular wall. AGEs are formed during the Mailiard reaction by the binding of aldoses on free NH2 groups of proteins, which, after a cascade of molecular rearrangements, result in molecules of brown color and specific fluorescence. Experimental studies have indicated that the binding of AGEs to RAGE activates cells, particularly monocytes and endothelial calls. Activated endothelial cells produce cytokines, and express adhesion molecules and tissue factor. The role of AGEs in increased oxidative stress, and in the functional alterations in vascular tone control observed in diabetes, in part related to a reduction in nitric oxide, is also discussed. The microvascular retinal, glomerular and nerve lesions induced by experimental diabetes in animals are prevented by an inhibitor of AGEs formation, aminoguanidine. The administration in diabetic animals of recombinant RAGE, which hinders AGEs-RAGE interaction, prevents hyperpermeability and vascular lesions. These data suggest a central role of AGEs and RAGE in the development of chronic complications of diabetes.

AB  - We used a murine model to investigate functional interactions between tumors and peripheral nerves that may contribute to pain associated with cancer. Implantation of fibrosarcoma cells in and around the calcaneus bone produced mechanical hyperalgesia of the ipsilateral paw. Electrophysiological recordings from primary afferent fibers in control and hyperalgesic mice with tumor revealed the development of spontaneous activity (0.2-3.4 Hz) in 34% of cutaneous C-fibers adjacent to the tumor (9-17 d after implantation). C-fibers in tumor-bearing mice exhibited a mean decrease in heat threshold of 3.5 +/? 0.10 °C. We also examined innervation of the skin overlying the tumor. Epidermal nerve fibers (ENFs) were immunostained for protein gene product 9.5, imaged using confocal microscopy, and analyzed in terms of number of fibers per millimeter of epidermal length and branching (number of nodes per fiber). Divergent morphological changes were linked to tumor progression. Although branching of ENFs increased significantly relative to control values, in later stages (16-24 d after implantation) of tumor growth a sharp decrease in the number of ENFs was observed. This decay of epidermal innervation of skin over the tumor coincided temporally with gradual loss of electrophysiological activity in tumor-bearing mice. The development of spontaneous activity and sensitization to heat in C-fibers and increased innervation of cutaneous structures within the first 2 weeks of tumor growth suggest activation and sensitization of a proportion of C-fibers. The decrease in the number of ENFs observed in later stages of tumor development implicates neuropathic involvement in this model of cancer pain.

AB  - We report a case of congenital hypomyelination neuropathy presenting at birth. The infant had generalized hypotonia and weakness. There was decreased respiratory effort along with a right phrenic nerve and left vocal cord paralyses. Tongue fasciculations were present. Deep tendon reflexes were absent in the upper extremities and hypoactive (1+) in the lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head revealed no intracranial abnormalities, including normal cerebral myelination. Nerve conduction study showed absence of motor and sensory action potentials in the hands when the nerves in the upper limbs were stimulated. A motor response could be elicited only in the proximal leg muscles. Needle electromyography study was normal in the proximal limb muscles, but showed active denervation in the distal muscles of the arm and leg. These findings were thought to be consistent with a length-dependent sensorimotor peripheral polyneuropathy of axonal type with greater denervation of the distal muscles. A biopsy of the quadriceps muscle showed mild variability in fiber diameter, but no group typing or group atrophy. The muscle fibers showed no intrinsic abnormalities. Biopsy of the sural nerve showed scattered axons with very thin myelin sheaths. There was also a nearly complete loss of large diameter myelinated fibers. No onion bulb formations were noted. These findings were thought to be consistent with congenital hypomyelination neuropathy with a component of axonopathy. DNA analysis for identification of previously characterized mutations in the genes MPZ, PMP22, and EGR2 was negative. Several attempts at extubation failed and the infant became increasingly ventilator-dependent with increasing episodes of desaturation and hypercapnea. He also developed increasing weakness and decreased movement of all extremities. He underwent surgery at 2 months of age for placement of a gastrostomy tube and a tracheostomy. He was discharged from the hospital on a ventilator at 6 months of age. The infant was 13 months old at the time of submission of this report. Although he appears cognitively normal, he remains profoundly hypotonic and is on a home ventilator. There was no evidence of progressive weakness. Congenital hypomyelination neuropathy is a rare form of neonatal neuropathy that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a newborn with profound hypotonia and weakness. It appears to be a heterogeneous disorder with some of the cases being caused by specific genetic mutations.

AB  - Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) is a late-onset inherited disease characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils. FAP is associated with mutations on the transthyretin (TTR) gene. A monoclonal antibody, MAb 39-44, reacting with high molecular weight aggregates of TTR but not with tetrameric TTR has recently been generated and characterized. This antibody recognizes a cryptic epitope that is expressed in isolated recombinant amyloidogenic mutants and in ex vivo amyloid. In the present work we show that this amyloid-specific antibody specifically recognizes in a direct enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) plasma TTR from carriers of various mutations associated with FAP, both in asymptomatic individuals and in patients. In contrast, it does not react with plasma TTR from healthy individuals or that from carriers of nonpathogenic mutations. Using the ELISA developed in this study we identified three different TTR mutations in Portuguese patients with neuropathy of unknown cause, later shown to have amyloid tissue deposition. This antibody recognizes conformations that express cryptic epitopes shared by amyloidogenic TTR variants associated with FAP, not present among nonpathogenic TTR molecules. This antibody will contribute to further identify and characterize intermediates of the amyloidogenic cascade. In addition, it will also be useful for screening amyloidogenic TTR mutations in patients with neuropathy of unknown cause, prior to precise molecular diagnosis using protein and/or DNA analysis.

Overall, 97% were diagnosed as type 2 diabetes, with a mean age (+/?S.D.) of 61.6 +/? 11.3 years, duration of diabetes of 10.3 +/? 7.3 years and age at onset of diabetes of 51.5 +/? 11.8 years. Mean BMI was 25.1 +/? 3.6 kg/m(2) and about 50% had BMI> 25 kg/m(2). Majority (75%) were treated with oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs), 14% with insulin and 10% with combination of insulin and OHA. Mean HbA(1c) was 8.1 +/? 1.6% and 59% had HbA(1c)> 7.4% (1% above the upper limit of normal range, 4.7-6.4%). Mean FBG was 9.0 +/? 3.3 mmol/l and 59% had FBG> 7.8 mmol/l. Of all the patients who had screening for complications, cataract (38%), neuropathy (30%), proteinuria (17%) and stroke (6%) were the most frequently reported eye, feet, kidney and late complications. We conclude that the majority of patients involved in this study had unsatisfactory glycaemic control which may lead to diabetes complications.
