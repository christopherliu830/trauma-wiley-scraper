AB  - Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) is a late-onset inherited disease characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils. FAP is associated with mutations on the transthyretin (TTR) gene. A monoclonal antibody, MAb 39-44, reacting with high molecular weight aggregates of TTR but not with tetrameric TTR has recently been generated and characterized. This antibody recognizes a cryptic epitope that is expressed in isolated recombinant amyloidogenic mutants and in ex vivo amyloid. In the present work we show that this amyloid-specific antibody specifically recognizes in a direct enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) plasma TTR from carriers of various mutations associated with FAP, both in asymptomatic individuals and in patients. In contrast, it does not react with plasma TTR from healthy individuals or that from carriers of nonpathogenic mutations. Using the ELISA developed in this study we identified three different TTR mutations in Portuguese patients with neuropathy of unknown cause, later shown to have amyloid tissue deposition. This antibody recognizes conformations that express cryptic epitopes shared by amyloidogenic TTR variants associated with FAP, not present among nonpathogenic TTR molecules. This antibody will contribute to further identify and characterize intermediates of the amyloidogenic cascade. In addition, it will also be useful for screening amyloidogenic TTR mutations in patients with neuropathy of unknown cause, prior to precise molecular diagnosis using protein and/or DNA analysis.

AB  - The aim of this study was to provide an overview of diabetes management and complication status in Taiwan. A cohort of 2446 patients (from 25 diabetic centers) with more than 12 months of diabetes management participated and data were collected by interviews and reviewing the medical records. Overall, 97% were diagnosed as type 2 diabetes, with a mean age (+/?S.D.) of 61.6 +/? 11.3 years, duration of diabetes of 10.3 +/? 7.3 years and age at onset of diabetes of 51.5 +/? 11.8 years. Mean BMI was 25.1 +/? 3.6 kg/m(2) and about 50% had BMI> 25 kg/m(2). Majority (75%) were treated with oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs), 14% with insulin and 10% with combination of insulin and OHA. Mean HbA(1c) was 8.1 +/? 1.6% and 59% had HbA(1c)> 7.4% (1% above the upper limit of normal range, 4.7-6.4%). Mean FBG was 9.0 +/? 3.3 mmol/l and 59% had FBG> 7.8 mmol/l. Of all the patients who had screening for complications, cataract (38%), neuropathy (30%), proteinuria (17%) and stroke (6%) were the most frequently reported eye, feet, kidney and late complications. We conclude that the majority of patients involved in this study had unsatisfactory glycaemic control which may lead to diabetes complications.

AB  - Hereditary Neuralgic Amyotrophy (HNA) is an autosomal dominantly inherited recurrent focal neuropathy affecting mainly the brachial plexus. Linkage to markers on chromosome 17q25 was found in 1996 and subsequent reports confirmed linkage of HNA to this locus. Recently a family with a chronic undulating rather than remitting-relapsing clinical course of HNA was described by a Dutch group. This family did not have linkage to the 17q25 locus. Here we describe for the first time clinically and genetically two families with classic remitting-relapsing HNA that are not linked to the previously described HNA locus on chromosome 17q25. These results demonstrate that clinically homogeneous classical HNA is genetically heterogeneous.

AB  - The excitability of human axons can be studied reliably using the technique of threshold tracking, which allows the strength of a test stimulus to be adjusted by computer to activate a defined fraction of the maximal nerve or muscle action potential. The stimulus current that just evokes the target response is considered the ?threshold? for that response. More useful than the resting threshold are other indices of axonal excitability derived from pairs of threshold measurements, such as refractoriness, supernormality, strength-duration time constant and ?threshold electrotonus? (i.e. the changes in threshold produced by long-lasting depolarizing or hyperpolarizing current pulses). Each of these measurements depends on membrane potential and on other biophysical properties of the axons. Together they can provide new information about the pathophysiology underlying abnormalities in excitability in neuropathy.

AB  - Objective We tested the hypothesis that initiation of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) antagonists reduced the risk of fractures compared to nonbiologic comparators in patients with autoimmune diseases. Methods Using 4 large administrative databases, we assembled retrospective cohorts of patients with autoimmune diseases who initiated either a TNFα antagonist or a nonbiologic medication. We identified 3 mutually exclusive disease groups: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and a combined group: psoriasis (PsO), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), or ankylosing spondylitis (AS). We used baseline covariate data to calculate propensity scores (PS) for each disease group and used Cox regression to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). We compared the risk of combined hip, radius/ulna, humerus, or pelvic fractures between PS-matched cohorts of new users of TNFα antagonists and nonbiologic comparators. Results We identified 9,020, 2,014, and 2,663 new PS-matched episodes of TNFα antagonist and nonbiologic comparator use in RA, IBD, and PsO-PsA-AS cohorts, respectively. The risk of combined fractures was similar between new users of TNFα antagonists and nonbiologic comparators for each disease (HR 1.17, 95% CI 0.91?1.51; HR 1.49, 95% CI 0.72?3.11; and HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.47?1.82 for RA, IBD, and PsO-PsA-AS, respectively). In RA, the risk of combined fractures was associated with an average daily dosage of prednisone equivalents >10 mg/day at baseline compared with no glucocorticoid (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.03?2.30). Conclusion The risk of fractures did not differ between initiators of a biologic agent and a nonbiologic comparator for any disease studied. Among RA patients, use of >10 mg/day of prednisone equivalents at baseline increased the fracture risk.

AB  - Summary Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurological disorder characterized by abnormal body movements (chorea) associated with cognitive and motor dysfunctions, neuropsychiatric disturbances, and striatal damage. 3-Nitropropionic acid (3-NP) triggers cellular energy deficit, nitric oxide (NO) mechanisms, and oxidative stress (OS)-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting the activity of mitochondrial complex II enzyme and succinate dehydrogenase in irreversible fashion. Chronic systemic administration of 3-NP to animals produces preferential degeneration of the striatum, leading to motor and cognitive deficits, closely resembling HD. Besides 3-NP model of striatal neurodegeneration, a number of transgenic animal models expressing mutant proteins are routinely used in preclinical trials exploring anti-HD therapeutics. In this review, the roles of a number of plant extracts, fractions, and isolated compounds investigated in various neurotoxic animal models and transgenics are discussed, highlighting on their ability to influence signaling pathways, leading to neuromodulation and probable neuroprotection. Since mitochondrial involvement and OS are also common phenomena in etiopathogenesis of a number of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), a few plant-based anti-HD natural products have been found efficacious against such diseases. Therapeutic advancement in screening of natural products against HD suffers from constraints such as limited animal models and giving maximum emphasis on cellular models during experimentations. However, recent progress in animal HD transgenic models expressing mutant proteins may reveal the therapeutic efficacy of natural products against HD, a disease with less elucidated pathogenesis and inadequate treatment strategies.
