AB  - Abstract To identify causes of death (COD) in propositi with Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) at various ages, and to develop guidelines to improve management and avoid morbidity and mortality, we retrospectively reviewed a total of 426 propositi with confirmed clinical diagnoses of CdLS in our database who died in a 41-year period between 1966 and 2007. Of these, 295 had an identifiable COD reported to us. Clinical, laboratory, and complete autopsy data were completed on 41, of which 38 were obtainable, an additional 19 had autopsies that only documented the COD, and 45 propositi had surgical, imaging, or terminal event clinical documentation of their COD. Proband ages ranged from fetuses (21?40 weeks gestation) to 61 years. A literature review was undertaken to identify all reported causes of death in CdLS individuals. In our cohort of 295 propositi with a known COD, respiratory causes including aspiration/reflux and pneumonias were the most common primary causes (31%), followed by gastrointestinal disease, including obstruction/volvulus (19%). Congenital anomalies accounted for 15% of deaths and included congenital diaphragmatic hernia and congenital heart defects. Acquired cardiac disease accounted for 3% of deaths. Neurological causes and accidents each accounted for 8%, sepsis for 4%, cancer for 2%, renal disease for 1.7%, and other causes, 9% of deaths. We also present 21 representative clinical cases for illustration. This comprehensive review has identified important etiologies contributing to the morbidity and mortality in this population that will provide for an improved understanding of clinical complications, and management for children and adults with CdLS. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Cerebral white matter damage is not only a commonly reported consequence of healthy aging, but is also associated with cognitive decline and dementia. The aetiology of this damage is unclear; however, individuals with hypertension have a greater burden of white matter signal abnormalities (WMSA) on MR imaging than those without hypertension. It is therefore possible that elevated blood pressure (BP) impacts white matter tissue structure which in turn has a negative impact on cognition. However, little information exists about whether vascular health indexed by BP mediates the relationship between cognition and white matter tissue structure. We used diffusion tensor imaging to examine the impact of vascular health on regional associations between white matter integrity and cognition in healthy older adults spanning the normotensive to moderate?severe hypertensive BP range (43?87 years; N = 128). We examined how white matter structure was associated with performance on tests of two cognitive domains, executive functioning (EF) and processing speed (PS), and how patterns of regional associations were modified by BP and WMSA. Multiple linear regression and structural equation models demonstrated associations between tissue structure, EF and PS in frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital white matter regions. Radial diffusivity was more prominently associated with performance than axial diffusivity. BP only minimally influenced the relationship between white matter integrity, EF and PS. However, WMSA volume had a major impact on neurocognitive associations. This suggests that, although BP and WMSA are causally related, these differential metrics of vascular health may act via independent pathways to influence brain structure, EF and PS.

AB  - Summary This study reports our experience using deceased donor liver grafts from HBsAg-positive donors. We performed eight cases of liver transplantation (LT) using grafts from deceased HBsAg-positive donors between November 2005 and October 2010. The median age of donors was 48 years (range: 26?64). HBV DNA in the serum of donors ranged from 44 to 395 IU/ml, but HBeAg in all donors was negative. Preoperative laboratory and liver biopsy samples revealed the absence of definitive cirrhotic features and hepatitis. All recipients showed HBsAg positive preoperatively except one patient with HBsAg(?) status post previous LT for HBV related liver cirrhosis. The median age was 60 years (range: 46?76) at LT. Post-LT antiviral management consisted of hepatitis B immunoglobulin and antiviral nucleos(t)ide analogues. The median follow-up period was 25.5 months (range: 14?82). Of eight recipients, two recipients experienced serum HBsAg and HBV DNA disappearance postoperatively. Three recipients died of HBV-unrelated causes. The remaining five recipients were stable with normal liver function and no marked pathologic changes on follow-up biopsies. This experience shows that LT using grafts from deceased HBsAg-positive donors is feasible, and may represent a valuable expansion of the pool of organ donors with appropriate antiviral management and monitoring.

AB  - Summary The adrenal glands are chiefly responsible for releasing hormones in response to stress through the synthesis of corticosteroids such as cortisol and catecholamines such as epinephrine, and in response to plasma osmolarity changes through the secretion of aldosterone. The adrenal cortex is divided into functional zones, including zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata, and zona reticularis. The outermost layer, the zona glomerulosa, is the main site for production of mineralocorticoids, mainly aldosterone, which is largely responsible for the long-term regulation of blood pressure by affecting the functions of the kidneys. The innermost cortical layer, the zona reticularis, produces androgens, mainly dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. Situated between the glomerulosa and reticularis, the zona fasciculata is responsible for producing glucocorticoids, chiefly cortisol. Whereas the zona glomerulosa is primarily regulated by angiotensin II, both the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis are regulated by corticotropin or adrenocorticotropic hormone. Both these zones become hypofunctional and atrophic when adrenocorticotropic hormone is deficient; on the other hand, they become hypertrophic and hyperplastic when adrenocorticotropic hormone is secreted in excess.
