AB  - Abstract The aetiological agents of many invasive fungal infections are saprobes and opportunistic pathogens. Some of these fungi are darkly pigmented due to melanin production and traditionally have been named ?dematiaceous?. The melanized fungi cause a wide array of clinical syndromes ranging from superficial to deep-seated infections. Diagnosis relies on histopathological examination of clinical specimens and on examination of cultures. Sequencing is recommended for accurate species identification, especially for unusual or newly described pathogens. In cases of mycetoma and chromoblastomycosis, pathognomonic histological findings are useful and the Fontana?Masson stain, specific for melanin, usually confirms the diagnosis. There are no standardized therapies but voriconazole, posaconazole and itraconazole demonstrate the most consistent in vitro activity against this group of fungi. Oral itraconazole has been considered the drug of choice, given the extensive clinical experience with this drug. However, voriconazole may presumably be superior for central nervous system infections because of its ability to achieve good levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. Posaconazole is a well-tolerated alternative drug, backed by less clinical experience but with excellent salvage treatment results after failure of other antifungals. Amphotericin B has been useful as alternative therapy in some cases. Combination antifungal therapy is recommended for cerebral abscesses when surgery is not possible and for disseminated infections in immunocompromised patients.

AB  - Summary This chapter covers the common causes, clinical features, diagnostic evaluation and management of hypothalamo-pituitary disease. The advent of new technologies such as whole exome and whole genome sequencing has resulted in an expanding list of genetic factors involved in human hypothalamo-pituitary disease. The chapter lists examples of genetic factors involved in isolated or multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies. The close proximity of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis to various vital structures means that acquired damage to this area can easily lead to hypopituitarism. The diagnosis of hypopituitarism is based upon a combination of clinical assessment, looking for the presence of not just endocrine-related symptoms and signs but also for other features related to the presence of a congenital syndrome or a suprasellar mass. Confirmation of hypopituitarism is a stepwise process, usually beginning with a baseline pituitary function screen, followed by dynamic pituitary function tests.

AB  - Background/aim Client-centred goal setting is fundamental to occupational therapy practice and has been increasingly embraced by all rehabilitation practioners. Goal setting in clinical practice is a highly individualised process and may be more challenging with people with acquired brain injury. However, research examining practice is limited. We developed the Client-Centred Goal Setting Practice Framework to explain how client-centred goals are developed in brain injury rehabilitation. This framework was based on interview data and may reflect practitioner's theoretical knowledge rather than goal setting processes used in routine practice. The aims of this study were to explore the application of the framework to every-day practice, examine the extent to which goal setting was client-centred and refine the framework. Methods A mixed methods approach was employed. Participants were community dwelling clients with ABI and their practitioners, drawn from a hospital outpatient service and community private practices. The communication exchange between practitioners and clients during routine goal setting was audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using framework analysis. Quantitative measures evaluated the client-centredness of goals. Results A total of 65 goal setting sessions with 36 clients and 17 practitioners (n = 8 occupational therapists) were analysed. The three goal setting phases of the framework and associated processes and strategies were represented. The ?establishing trust? process was interwoven throughout all phases and an additional strategy, ?social connection? was identified. Conclusion The framework provides preliminary evidence about the core processes and strategies which uses establishing trust to engage clients with ABI in goal setting, and may be a useful tool to guide client-centred goal setting practice in similar services.

AB  - Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is an uncommon but well-known complication after transplantation diagnosed by characteristic radiological features. As limited data on this complex syndrome exist we sought to better define the incidence, clinical presentation and risk factors for PRES in liver transplant (LTx) patients. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1923 adult LTx recipients transplanted between 2000 and 2010. PRES was diagnosed radiologically in 19 patients (1%), with 84% of cases occurring within 3 months post-LTX. We compared this cohort of PRES patients to 316 other LTx recipients also requiring radiographic imaging within 3 months after LTx for neurological symptoms. Seizure was the most common clinical manifestation in the PRES group (88% vs. 16%, p< 0.001) and 31% had an intracranial hemorrhage. Those with hemorrhage on imaging were more likely to be coagulopathic. PRES patients were significantly more likely to have had alcoholic liver disease and infection/sepsis. These factors may be related to a common pathway of vascular dysregulation/damage that appears to characterize this complex syndrome. Intracranial bleeding and seizures may be the end result of these phenomena. The relationship of these associated factors to the hypothesized pathophysiology of PRES is discussed.

AB  - Abstract Objective: This paper examines whether Australian regional primary health care organisations ? in this case, Medicare Locals (MLs) and Primary Health Networks (PHNs) ? have engaged with migrant and refugee health, and what factors encourage work in this area. Methods: The study used mixed methods with surveys of ML (N=210) and PHN staff (N=66), interviews with ML (N=50) and PHN (N=55) staff, national consultations with migrant and refugee organisations (N=8 groups with 62 participants), and analysis of ML and PHN documents. Results: Needs assessment documents identified migrant and refugee health issues in 46% of MLs and 74% of PHNs. However, 48% of MLs and 55% of PHNs did not report any activities on migrant health, and 78% and 62% did not report any activities for refugees, respectively. Key factors identified by participants as associated with whether ML and PHN focus on migrant and refugee health were the determination of local priority areas, policy context and funding, collaboration with migrant and refugee organisations and communities, and mechanisms for engagement. Conclusions: Despite the importance of primary health care for migrants and refugees, there was relatively little attention paid to these population groups in MLs and PHNs, with a small number of notable exceptions. Implications for public health: The paper concludes with a range of recommendations for improving regional primary health care organisation engagement with migrant and refugee health.

Key elements for surgical candidacy include a localized epileptogenic zone and a low risk for new postoperative neurological deficits. The strategies for identifying these elements for surgical candidacy are in evolution. This Symposium will examine current worldwide variations in pediatric epilepsy surgical practice, based on an international multicenter survey. Faculty will also examine age-related aspects to selection for surgery including lesion timing and type and functional plasticity, and strategies for surgery when MRI is normal or shows multiple lesions. Pediatric neurology and neurosurgery speakers will emphasize the tactics involved in designing a safe and effective plan for surgery for selected infants and children with intractable epilepsy.

Data show that thalamocortical, basal ganglia, midbrain and hindbrain circuits play important roles in seizure generation, conduction and modulation. The session will provide a basic overview of these systems and circuits, both functionally and anatomically. The thalamus uses systems able to synchronize or desynchronize electrical activity in wide regions of cortex. These thalamocortical systems play a role in generation of absence seizures and propagation of secondarily generalized seizures. The basal ganglia have a close relationship with the cortex, and may ?gate? activity through a widespread corticostriate system, thus potentially both enhancing and suppressing seizure activity. Midbrain and hindbrain circuits have been shown to have profound effects on seizures. The session will discuss how an understanding of subcortical-cortical networks can lead to therapeutic advances, with use of electrical brain stimulation or targeted pharmacotherapy as examples.
