AB  - Elaine Wyllie 1 and Michael Duchowny 2 ( 1 Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH and 2 Brain Institute, Miami Children's Hospital, Miami, FL ) Summary: Epilepsy surgery is accepted as an appropriate intervention for children with medically refractory epilepsy. Key elements for surgical candidacy include a localized epileptogenic zone and a low risk for new postoperative neurological deficits. The strategies for identifying these elements for surgical candidacy are in evolution. This Symposium will examine current worldwide variations in pediatric epilepsy surgical practice, based on an international multicenter survey. Faculty will also examine age-related aspects to selection for surgery including lesion timing and type and functional plasticity, and strategies for surgery when MRI is normal or shows multiple lesions. Pediatric neurology and neurosurgery speakers will emphasize the tactics involved in designing a safe and effective plan for surgery for selected infants and children with intractable epilepsy.

AB  - Edward H. Bertram 1 , Gary Mathern 2 , Helen Cross 3 and Maria Thom 4 ( 1 Department of Neurology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA ; 2 Department of Neurosurgery, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA ; 3 Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom and 4 Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, United Kingdom ) Summary: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) has been synonymous with hippocampal sclerosis, such that the consensus is that the removal of the latter cures the former. There is increasing information, including recent epidemiological data regarding the long term outcomes of surgery, that suggests that the underlying basis for the disorder is more extensive than originally thought. The ultimate question for improving outcomes is ?What is the true focus for MTLE?? Although our understanding of what constitutes the focus remains limited, there is evidence from surgical outcome, pathology, imaging and animal studies that the hippocampus alone is not the answer. Outcome studies show that only a small percentage of patients who are seizure free following surgery for MTLE can successfully stop medications and remain seizure free. Further there is evidence that the number of patients in remission falls steadily, even after a period of seizure freedom. These observations suggest that the seizure focus has not been completely removed. Studies of the temporal lobe pathology demonstrate changes that are variable but which extend beyond the hippocampus. Imaging has been a key factor in identifying structural abnormalities, but we may be missing key pieces of information that could identify the focus more precisely. Animal studies indicate that the ictal onset zone may be extensive and extend well beyond the hippocampus, but a true understanding of the physical substrate for seizure initiation still eludes us. This session is asking questions for which we only have partial answers. What do we know now about the seizure focus in MTLE? What do we need to know to have better outcomes? We don't have any good answers for either question other than a) not enough and b) a lot more. We hope this session will stimulate the participants to fill in the many gaps that now exist.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: Bergström needle muscle biopsies have been used by exercise physiologists for over 35 years but have been less accepted by neuromuscular clinicians due to size concerns. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed over 13,500 muscle Bergström needle biopsies done over a 21-year period to determine sampling success, patient/subject experience, and complications. We compared sample yield between two different needles (Bergström vs. UCH), with and without suction modifications. Results: Needle biopsies adequate for histology and enzymology were obtainable from the vastus lateralis, deltoid, biceps brachii, soleus, and medial gastrocnemius muscles, with a success rate of >99.9% and a minor complication rate of 0.15%. Approximately 450 muscle fibers were submitted for histologic assessment; suction modification and use of the Bergström vs. UCH needle were associated with larger sample size (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The suction-modified Bergström needle muscle biopsy technique is safe and provides an adequate sample size for histologic, ultrastructural, DNA, and enzyme analysis. Muscle Nerve, 2011

AB  - Abstract Background The definitive treatment for head and neck paraganglioma (PG) is surgical excision. Unfortunately, surgery, particularly of vagal paraganglioma (VPG; ?glomus vagale?) and foramen jugulare (?glomus jugulare?) tumors, may be complicated by injuries to the lower cranial nerves, a high price to pay for treatment for a benign tumor. Alternatively these tumors may be followed without treatment, or irradiated. The purpose of this review was to compare the existing evidence concerning the efficacy and safety of surgery, external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), for jugular paragangliomas (JPGs) and VPGs. Methods Relevant articles were reviewed using strict criteria for systematic searches. Forty-one surgical studies met the criteria which included 1310 patients. Twenty articles including 461 patients treated with EBRT, and 14 radiosurgery studies comprising 261 patients were also evaluated. Results were compared between treatment modalities using analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests. Results A total of 1084 patients with JPGs and 226 VPGs were treated with different surgical procedures. Long-term control of the disease was achieved in 78.2% and 93.3% of patients, respectively. A total of 715 patients with JPG were treated with radiotherapy: 461 with EBRT and 254 with SRS. Control of the disease with both methods was obtained in 89.1% and 93.7% of the patients, respectively. The treatment outcomes of a JPG treated with surgery or radiotherapy were compared. Tumor control failure, major complication rates, and the number of cranial nerve palsies after treatment were significantly higher in surgical than in radiotherapy series. The results of SRS and EBRT in JPGs were compared and no significant differences were observed in tumor control. Because only 1 article reported on the treatment of 10 VPGs with radiotherapy, no comparisons with surgery could be made. Nevertheless, the vagus nerve was functionally preserved in only 11 of 254 surgically treated patients (4.3%). Conclusion There is evidence that EBRT and SRS offer a similar chance of tumor control with lower risks of morbidity compared with surgery in patients with JPGs. Although the evidence is based on retrospective studies, these results suggest that surgery should be considered only for selected cases, but the decision should be individual for every patient. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
