AB  - Background:? The aims of this cohort study were to assess the survival of trauma patients treated in a general intensive care unit (ICU) and to evaluate the simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II, maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, injury severity score (ISS), age, sex and severe head injury as predictors of 30-day mortality. Methods:? Three hundred and twenty-five adult patients admitted during 1998?2003 were evaluated retrospectively with update of survival data in January 2005. Kaplan?Meier statistics and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to study survival and to assess predictors of mortality, respectively. Results:? The 30-day mortality was 16.9%, ICU mortality 13.8% and hospital mortality 17.8%. Long-term survival (observation time, 1?7 years) was 77.8%. After 3.5 years, mortality was the same as for the background population. Severe head injury was the main cause of death and increased the risk of 30-day mortality 2.4-fold. In addition, SAPS II and an age above 50 years proved to be significant predictors of mortality in a multivariate analysis. Sex was not associated with mortality, and ISS and the maximum SOFA score were significant predictors in univariate analyses only. Conclusion:? Reduced long-term survival was observed up to 3.5 years after acute injury. The 30-day mortality was strongly related to severe head injury, SAPS II and an age above 50 years. These variables may be useful as predictors of mortality, and may contribute to risk adjustment of this subset of trauma patients when treatment results from different centres are compared.

AB  - Background Heparin-binding protein (HBP) is a neutrophil-derived protein advocated as a biomarker in sepsis. We evaluated plasma HBP as a predictor of post-injury sepsis in trauma patients. Methods Ninety-seven trauma patients were studied during the first week of intensive care. Injury-related data were collected and clinical parameters registered daily. Plasma HBP was sampled on day 1, 3 and 5 after trauma and evaluated for associations with injury-related parameters and sepsis. The predictive properties of HBP were compared to C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC). Results Median Injury Severity Score was 33, one-third of the trauma patients received massive transfusion and a quarter was in shock on arrival. Overall 30-day mortality was 8%. Plasma HBP was significantly higher in severely injured patients and associated with shock on arrival, massive transfusions and organ failure. Septic patients had higher levels of HBP only on day 5. When evaluated for prediction of onset of sepsis during the two following days after plasma sampling by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, areas under the curves were non-significant for all time points. Similar patterns were seen for CRP and WBC. Conclusion In trauma patients, HBP levels are related to severity of injury and organ dysfunction. Heparin-binding protein was weakly associated with sepsis and only at the later stage of the observation period of 1 week. Moreover, HBP showed poor discriminatory properties as an early biomarker of post-injury sepsis. Trauma-induced inflammation during the post-injury phase may blunt the sepsis-predictive performance of HBP.

AB  - Objective. To understand the experiences that people with early psychosis are adjusting to and their perceived barriers to recovery. Method. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight participants. Grounded Theory was applied to the design and analysis. Sampling and coding ceased when saturation of the data was reached. Respondent validation was sought from participants. Results. A theoretical model was developed using Strauss and Corbin's (1998) framework. A core category of distress was elicited, which was evident in all participants? accounts of their recovery. Overall six main categories were identified and it was proposed that individuals were adjusting to the distress of past experiences, uncertainty, a challenged identity, being in a psychiatric system, the reaction of others and social disadvantage. Conclusions. Recovery from the distress and trauma of early psychosis does not simply involve adjustment to and recovery from a single experience or set of symptoms. The results are discussed in relation to trauma, developmental, and social inequality frameworks. Specific implications for clinical practice include incorporating the findings within formulations, developing interventions that focus on trauma, identity, and uncertainty as well as addressing the social and systemic issues identified. Practitioner Points ?? Recovery from early psychosis is multi-faceted. Psychological formulations should seek to consider individual, social, and systemic factors influencing an individual's distress to more fully conceptualize what an individual's adjustment to early psychosis may involve. ?? Services and wider systems should consider iatrogenic processes, which may contribute to and maintain the distress experienced by those with early psychosis. ?? Education programmes that look to contextualize psychosis within a meaningful framework may help to develop understanding within wider society where a lack of knowledge and understanding serves to reinforce an individual's sense of exclusion and difference.

AB  - Background: Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) is suggested to reflect the adequacy of oxygen delivery, and the main objective of the present study was to determine whether ScvO2 is associated with outcome in haemodynamically stabilized trauma patients. Methods: Haemodynamically unstable trauma patients receiving a central venous line within 1?h of admission were eligible for inclusion in this prospective observational study. The mean arterial pressure (MAP), lactate and ScvO2 were recorded at inclusion and every 6?h for 36?h or until lactate was <2.0?mmol/l and ScvO2 was >75% in two consecutive measurements. Patients with a MAP of ≥70?mmHg were considered to be haemodynamically stabilized. The outcome measure was complications defined as infections, delta sequential organ failure assessment score of >0, and mortality. Results: Fifty patients with a median new injury severity score of 27 (17?34) were analysed. Complications occurred in 33 patients. An association between ScvO2 following resuscitation to MAP ≥70?mmHg and complications was detected with an odds ratio of 0.94 (95% confidence interval; 0.89?0.99). This association was also significant when adjusted for injury severity. The result implies that a low ScvO2 value is associated with more complications. The optimal cut-off for ScvO2 to discriminate between patients who did or did not develop complications was found to be 66.5% (56?86%). Conclusions: These data suggest that low ScvO2 in haemodynamically stabilized patients is associated with a poor outcome and that ScvO2 represents a potential endpoint of resuscitation in trauma patients.

AB  - Background: We investigated the incidence and severity of post-injury morbidity and mortality in intensive care unit (ICU)-treated trauma patients. We also identified risk factors in the early phase after injury that predicted the later development of complications. Methods: A prospective observational cohort study design was used. One hundred and sixty-four adult patients admitted to the ICU for more than 24?h were included during a 21-month period. The incidence and severity of morbidity such as multiple organ failure (MOF), acute lung injury (ALI), severe sepsis and 30-day post-injury mortality were calculated and risk factors were analyzed with uni- and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: The median age was 40 years, the injury severity score was 24, the new injury severity score was 29, the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score was 15, sequential organ failure assessment maximum was 7 and ICU length of stay was 3.1 days. The incidences of post-injury MOF were 40.2%, ALI 25.6%, severe sepsis 31.1% and 30-day mortality 10.4%. The independent risk factors differed to some extent between the outcome parameters. Age, severity of injury, significant head injury and massive transfusion were independent risk factors for several outcome parameters. Positive blood alcohol was only a predictor of MOF, whereas prolonged rescue time only predicted death. Unexpectedly, injury severity was not an independent risk factor for mortality. Conclusions: Although the incidence of morbidity was considerable, mortality was relatively low. Early post-injury risk factors that predicted later development of complications differed between morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Aim:? The specific incidence of ischemic hepatitis in septic shock patients remains unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of ischemic hepatitis in septic shock and its relationship with mortality. Methods:? We retrospectively studied 181 patients with septic shock admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). We defined ischemic hepatitis as having a value of serum aminotransferases equal to or higher than 1000?IU/L. We recorded the age, sex, comorbidity, site of infection, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score on admission to the ICU, maximum SOFA score and inadequate antibiotic therapy. Results:? Twenty-five (13.8%) patients developed ischemic hepatitis. In-hospital mortality was 57% (103 patients). In the ischemic hepatitis group, mortality increased up to 84.0% (21 patients) compared with 52.6% (82 patients) in patients without ischemic hepatitis (control group) (odds ratio [OR]: 4.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6?14.4; P?=?0.003). The development of ischemic hepatitis, age, maximum SOFA score and inadequate antibiotic therapy were independently associated with an increased risk of death. The odds of death increased by 247% in ischemic hepatitis (OR: 3.47; 95% CI: 1.02?11.8; P?=?0.047). Conclusion:? Ischemic hepatitis is a common complication in septic shock patients, associated with a high mortality.

AB  - How can we study the ?quality of psychoanalytic treatments?? The authors attempt to answer this question by discussing a naturalistic, multi-perspective and representative follow-up study of psychoanalyses and long-term psychoanalytic psychotherapies. We studied a representative sample (n = 401) of all the patients who had terminated their psychoanalytic treatments with members of the German Psychoanalytical Association (DPV) between 1990 and 1993. Between 70 and 80 per cent of the patients achieved (average 6.5 years after the end of treatment) good and stable psychic changes according to the evaluations of the patients themselves, their analysts, independent psychoanalytic and non-psychoanalytic experts, and questionnaires commonly applied in psychotherapy research. The evaluation of mental health costs showed a cost reduction through fewer days of sick leave during the seven years following the end of long-term psychoanalytic treatments. The results achieved using non-psychoanalytical instruments are complemented by the richness of the idiosyncratic findings, gained by the psychoanalytic research instruments.

AB  - Objectives People living with HIV (PLWH) have multidimensional concerns requiring person-centred care. Routine use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) improves outcomes. No brief PROM currently reflects the breadth of concerns for PLWH. This study sought to identify priority outcomes for PLWH, model current practice, explore views on introducing PROMs into routine care, and devise a model for person-centred care incorporating the PROM. Methods A cross-national multi-centre study (London, Brighton and Dublin) was carried out. Semi-structured qualitative interviews with adult PLWH, HIV health care professionals and HIV commissioners (responsible for planning and commissioning services) were performed. Interviews were analysed using thematic and framework analysis. Results PLWH (n = 28), professionals (n = 21) and commissioners (n = 8) described concerns related to living with HIV across six domains: physical (e.g. pain and gastrointestinal symptoms), cognitive (e.g. memory and sleep), psychological (e.g. anxiety and depression), social (e.g. isolation and intimacy), welfare (e.g. finances and fears regarding change of immigration status), and information (e.g. long-term outcomes) needs. Themes were highly inter-related, impacting across domains of need (e.g. physical and cognitive problems impacting on psychological and social wellbeing). Perceived benefits of using PROMs in routine HIV care included improved person-centredness, patient empowerment, fewer missed concerns, increased engagement with services, and informed planning of services. Potential challenges included heterogeneity of PLWH, literacy, and utility for those who struggle to engage with care. Conclusions This study presents a novel model of person-centred care incorporating an HIV-specific PROM. The model reflects priorities of key stakeholders. Explicit use of PROMs in routine HIV care could afford benefits for PLWH, clinical teams and commissioners.

AB  - Abstract Introduction. Recognition of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), intensive care, shifting away from early surgical treatment, and monitoring of the intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is important in the management of SAP. The aim of our study was retrospective evaluation and critical assessment of the experience with SAP management protocol involving new strategy in the university hospital. Methods. Protocols of 274 SAP patients treated in our institution during the last eight years were reassessed. APACHE II, CRP and SOFA score, IAP, pulmonary complications, ventilatory support and infection rate were evaluated. The success of the conservative treatment, surgical interventions and mortality was analysed comparing period 1 from 1999 to 2002 and period 2 from 2003 to 2006. Results. More patients with necrotising SAP were treated in period 2. The average CRP and SOFA score was higher in period 2, p=0.018; p=0.011. A total of 139 patients underwent continuous veno-venouse haemofiltration (CVVH) as a component of fluid resuscitation and IAP control. Application of CVVH increased in period 2, p<0.005. Only 5?8% of patients were managed with ventilatory support. The overall infection rate decreased in period 2 comprising 21%, p<0.005. Success rate of the conservative therapy reached 69% in period 2, p<0.01. Surgical treatment was performed in 41% of patients in period 1 vs. 19% in period 2, p<0.001. Overall mortality was 19%, with a reduction to 12% in year 2006. Conclusion. The conservative protocol-based approach is a rational treatment strategy for the management of SAP and can be successfully implemented in the setting of the university hospital.

AB  - Background:? Severe infection is a common reason for intensive care and contributes to increased morbidity and mortality. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of infection among intensive care unit (ICU) patients and to evaluate the consequences of ICU-acquired infection on morbidity and mortality. Methods:? A total of 812 patients consecutively admitted for more than 48?h to the ICU at Vilnius University Emergency Hospital, Lithuania, were included in the prospective observational study. Organ dysfunction was assessed using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) system. Results:? Thirty-seven per cent of patients were identified who developed at least one ICU-acquired infection. Respiratory, bloodstream and urinary tract infections were the most common. The main isolates were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, S. aureus, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas species. More severe degree of organ dysfunction, prolonged stay in the ICU and higher hospital mortality rate were more common among patients who acquired infection in the ICU than that of non-infected patients. Conclusion:? The prevalence of infection in the ICU was similar to other studies in European countries. The occurrence of ICU-acquired infection was significantly related to the increase in morbidity and mortality. The findings are useful for the comparison of the prevalence rate of infection and implementation of strict infection control policy.

AB  - Abstract Background. Increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is detrimental for the recovery of organ function in trauma and emergency patients. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between the dynamics of IAP and organ dysfunction in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). Materials and methods. Management of SAP between 2000 and 2004 was analysed. SAP was classified according to Atlanta 1992. Organ dysfunction, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and outcomes in relation to the IAP were assessed. IAP was measured indirectly. Results. A total of 65 patients, with an average APACHE II score of 6.44, complied with the Atlanta criteria. In all, 34 patients received conservative treatment and 31 were operated. SIRS was observed in 59 cases and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in 61 cases. IAP was significantly higher in the 25 most complicated patients requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), compared with 40 patients without RRT, 31.72 vs 21.4 cm/H2O (p=0.037). IAP interrelated positively with SOFA score (r =+ 0.371, p<0.01) and organs involved (r =+ 0.356, p<0.01), and negatively with platelet count and enterally provided volume (r =? 0.284, p<0.01; r =? 0.5, p<0.01, respectively). Overall mortality (9.2%) was associated with surgery and sustained increase of the IAP over 25 cm/H2O. Our data support the pathophysiological interrelation of elevated IAP and development of organ dysfunction. Conclusion. Development of organ dysfunction in SAP could be associated with increased IAP. Grade III increase of IAP should be considered as an indicator for revision of treatment modalities.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to evaluate if magnesium deviations correlate with higher 180 day overall mortality or increased morbidity, compared to controls. Methods We conducted a retrospective study on 5369 patients with 22,003 magnesium values treated at the Adult Intensive Care Unit at Skåne University Hospital, Lund, Sweden during 2006?2014. The patients were retrospectively divided into a control group with only normal magnesium values 0.7?1.0 mmol/l, and three study groups; hypomagnesemic; Mg2+ < 0.7 mmol/l, hypermagnesemic; Mg2+ > 1.0 mmol/l and an unstable mixed group showing both hypo/hypermagnesemia. Gender, age, disease severity represented by maximum organ system SOFA score, renal SOFA score, lowest potassium value and diagnoses classes were included in a Cox hazard model in order to adjust for confounding factors, with time to death in the first 180 days from the ICU admission as outcome. Results The hypermagnesemic study group and the mixed group showed increased hazard ratios for mortality; 1.4 (CI 98.3% 1.2, 1.6, P < 0.0001) and 2.1 (CI 98.3% 1.2, 2.8, P < 0.0001) respectively, compared to controls, while the hypomagnesemic group did not reach significance. In addition, patients in the hypermagnesemic and the mixed groups are older, more ill with significantly higher EMR and SOFA scores and show significantly longer ventilator times and ICU stays, compared to controls. Conclusions Patients with magnesium deviations are more ill compared to patients with explicitly normal magnesium values throughout the ICU stay. Cox analysis suggests that the magnesium deviation itself might have an impact on mortality.

The aim of the study was to study the consequences on mortality and morbidity of the introduction of this P. aeruginosa strain to intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Methods:? Forty-four out of 96 patients admitted to the general ICU of Akershus University Hospital during the outbreak, ventilated for more than 24 h and with at least one microbiological sample, were included and followed until death or hospital discharge. All isolated P. aeruginosa strains were genotyped. Demographic data, admission diagnosis, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, comorbidities, and antibiotics used in the first week were recorded. Results:? The outbreak strain was found in 18 patients (41%) of whom seven became infected. Median time to the first positive culture was 4 days. These 18 patients spent a significantly longer time on mechanical ventilation (P =0.03) and had a significantly higher hospital mortality, 55.5% vs. 19.2% (P =0.03), than non-colonized patients. The number of patients with severe underlying disease was significantly higher (P =0.01) and the decline in SOFA score was significantly slower in the pseudomonas group (P =0.02). Irrespective of colonization status, patients with severe underlying disease had a significantly higher mortality (58%) than those without (16%) (P =0.009). Conclusion:? Use of contaminated oral swabs led to a high rate of early airways colonization. Patients with severe underlying disease were more likely to become colonized, but whether colonization has any influence on hospital mortality requires further study.

AB  - Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment protocols have been introduced in the intensive care unit (ICU) to avoid secondary brain injury. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the deviations from such a treatment protocol and the frequency of extracranial complications, and relate these findings to outcome. Methods During a 5-year period (2004?2009), 133 patients with severe TBI [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score?≤?8] were prospectively included. The following deviations from treatment goals were studied: intracranial pressure (ICP), blood pressure, haemoglobin, blood glucose, serum sodium, serum albumin, body temperature and extracranial complications during the ICU stay. Outcome was assessed using Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score at 12 months. Results The frequencies of deviations from the treatment goals were: episodes of intracranial hypertension 69.5% (of monitored patients), hypotension 20.3%, anaemia 77.4%, hyperglycaemia 42.9%, hyponatremia 34.6%, hypoalbuminemia 30.8% and hyperthermia 54.9%. Pulmonary complications were common (pneumonia 72.2%, acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury 31.6%). Thrombocytopenia (4.5%), severe sepsis (3.0%), renal failure (0.8%) and liver failure (0.8%) were infrequent. Twenty-six (19.5%) patients died within the first 12 months due to the head injury. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, Injury Severity Score (ISS), ICP?>?25?mmHg, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome. Conclusions Deviations from the TBI treatment protocol were frequent. Pneumonia was the most frequent extracranial complication. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, ISS, high ICP, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome.

AB  - Abstract Haemodynamic targets, such as cardiac output, mean arterial blood pressure and central venous oxygen saturations, remain crude predictors of tissue perfusion and oxygen supply at a cellular level. Shocked patients may appear adequately resuscitated based on normalization of global vital signs, yet they are still experiencing occult hypoperfusion. If targeted resuscitation is employed, appropriate use of end-points is critical. In this review, we consider the value of directing resuscitation at the microcirculation or cellular level. Current technologies available include sublingual capnometry, video microscopy of the microcirculation and near-infrared spectroscopy providing a measure of tissue oxygenation, whereas base deficit and lactate potentially provide a surrogate measure of the adequacy of global perfusion. The methodology and evidence for these technologies guiding resuscitation are considered in this narrative review.

Abstract:? Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can rescue some critical patients with circulatory collapse when intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and ventricular assist devices (VAD) are not suitable. A subset of these patients can use ECMO for direct bridging, or indirect double bridging via VAD to heart transplantation (HTx). For these patients, we identified risk factors for unsuccessful ECMO bridging, with survival to receiving either HTx or VAD as the measure of success. The characteristics evaluated were age, sex, body mass index, pre-ECMO cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), IABP use, dialysis use, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and the etiology of cardiomyopathy. From January 1995 to August 2007, there were 70 adult ECMO patients with the intent to bridge to HTx (male: 55, age: 46?±?14?yr). Thirty-one patients (44%) were successful in bridging. A stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis found that age?>?50?yr (p?=?0.003), pre-ECMO CPR (p?=?0.001) and SOFA score?>?10 at ECMO initiation (p?=?0.018) were significant independent predictors of unsuccessful bridging. Direct VAD implantation, if possible, is preferable to double bridging in patients over 50?yr. Also, elective ECMO support before hemodynamic deterioration to cardiac arrest or multiple organ dysfunction would improve rates of successful ECMO bridging.

AB  - Abstract This study aimed to investigate whether the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score at emergency department (ED) presentation can help improve the risk assessment of glyphosate-surfactant herbicide (GlySH) poisoning complications. A total of 150 patients presenting with acute glyphosate herbicide ingestion were enrolled in this retrospective observational study. The qSOFA scores at presentation, ?qSOFA (calculated by subtracting the worst qSOFA score from 1 hr after admission from the qSOFA score at presentation), baseline characteristics, clinical courses and outcome were collected and analysed. A total of 41 patients had life-threatening complications (27.3%), and 14 patients died (9.3%). Patients with a qSOFA score of 0 at presentation had a 1.5% incidence rate of complications. As the qSOFA score at presentation increased from 1 to 3, the rate of life-threatening complications significantly increased from 29.6% to 100%. Patients with a ?qSOFA of 1 had a higher frequency of complications than did patients with a ?qSOFA of 0. The qSOFA score (OR: 8.39, 95% CI: 3.51?26.67) and ?qSOFA (OR: 27.60, 95% CI: 3.87?575.67) were associated with the development of life-threatening complications in the multivariate analysis. The qSOFA score showed high sensitivity (97.56%), and the ?qSOFA score showed high specificity (99.08%). The values of area under the curve were significantly higher in the models using the qSOFA and ?qSOFA than they were in the models using previously known prognostic factors (p < 0.01). The clinician should pay more attention to patients with high qSOFA scores at presentation or an increase in the qSOFA score 1 hr after admission.

AB  - Summary Host genetic variations may influence a changing profile of biochemical markers and outcome in patients with trauma/injury. The objective of this study was to assess clinical associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes of cytokines in critically ill patients. A total of 430 patients were genotyped for SNPs in the genes of pro- (IL1B, IL6, IL8) and anti-inflammatory (IL4, IL10, IL13) cytokines. The main end-points were sepsis, mortality and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We evaluated the dynamic levels of bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, creatine kinase, creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase in five points of measurements (between 1 and 14 days after admission) and correlated them with SNPs. High-producing alleles of proinflammatory cytokines protected patients against sepsis (IL1B ?511A and IL8 ?251A) and mortality (IL1B ?511A). High-producing alleles of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL4 ?589T and IL13 431A (144Gln) were less frequent in ARDS patients. The carriers of IL6 ?174C/C genotypes were prone to the increased levels of biochemical markers and acute kidney and liver insufficiency. Genotype-dependent differences in the levels of biochemical indicators gradually increased to a maximal value on the 14th day after admission. These findings suggest that genetic variability in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to different clinical phenotypes in patients at high risk of critical illness.
