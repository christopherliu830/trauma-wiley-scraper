AB  - The growing understanding of correlations between experiences and memories from a period of intensive care treatment and complaints of mental character has led to the development of various patient follow-up offers. Little, however, is known about what follow-up may mean to patients. The aim of this study was to explore the meaning of patients? lived experience of being followed-up in a programme consisting of patient diaries, post-intensive care unit (ICU) conversations and visits back to the ICU. Field notes were made from encounters with patients (n?=?10) during follow-up. Then they were interviewed twice, at about 6?months (n?=?8) and at about 18?months (n?=?6) after discharge from hospital. The first interview focused on the patients? experience during intensive care and on their reflections on the experience. The second interview had a particular focus on the meaning for each individual of the sources for understanding that they had been offered. The data was analysed by using a hermeneutic-phenomenological approach. The study corroborated earlier research that found that patients seek to understand experiences they have undergone. They search for meaning in experiences and memories. It is realized that the diary as text and photos, in addition to conveying care and love, is important to induce postexperience reflections. It provided guideposts that follow-up conversations could pursue in the patient?s quest for meaning. The conversation also provided an opening for, and could in itself be essential to, the patient?s willingness to talk about experiences. It allowed the nurse to accompany the patient in his quest for meaning. The return visit appeared to be significant in the patient?s quest for meaning. It was via ?feeling? the room that ?things? fell into place. The study is important in elucidating aspects that are beneficial in the patient?s follow-up and which lay the basis for further development of existing and new follow-up offers.

AB  - Summary A therapist is neither an artist nor a scientist. And yet the therapist's activity involves both art and science. The therapist knows how to negotiate a way between knowledge and skill, and appreciates what he or she must not try to explore. Thus, somewhat contradictorily no doubt, the therapist must know the contexts in which it is best not to intervene as well as the points where it is proper to do so. The therapist has to act locally, while, at the same time, thinking globally enough for what he or she is doing to be pertinent.
