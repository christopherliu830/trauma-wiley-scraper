AB  - Summary This chapter explores the way in which the ?project? for Moscow as the capital was shown on film before the architectural designs were actually implemented, using cinema as testing ground for the Grand Reconstruction under Stalin during the 1930s. It sketches the changes and shifts in the representation of Moscow in post-war cinema, before analyzing the images of Moscow in contemporary, post-Soviet cinema. The chapter presents that Moscow was never just a shooting location: rather, cinema has projected the city as it should be onto the silver screen, and rarely, only episodically, does the real Moscow appear in film. It attempts to demonstrate this ?loss of face? that the city undergoes in the new millennium, if not in architectural terms, then at least in its screen representation. With the demise of the communist state and, more importantly, the collapse of the Soviet dream of socialism, an entire value system vanished.

AB  - Abstract In this Editor's Review, articles published in 2018 are organized by category and summarized. We provide a brief reflection of the research and progress in artificial organs intended to advance and better human life while providing insight for continued application of these technologies and methods. Artificial Organs continues in the original mission of its founders ?to foster communications in the field of artificial organs on an international level.? Artificial Organs continues to publish developments and clinical applications of artificial organ technologies in this broad and expanding field of organ Replacement, Recovery, and Regeneration from all over the world. Peer-reviewed special issues this year included contributions from the 13th International Conference on Pediatric Mechanical Circulatory Support Systems and Pediatric Cardiopulmonary Perfusion edited by Dr. Akif Undar, and the 25th Congress of the International Society for Mechanical Circulatory Support edited by Dr. Marvin Slepian. Additionally, many editorials highlighted the worldwide survival differences in hemodialysis and perspectives on mechanical circulatory support and stem cell therapies for cardiac support. We take this time also to express our gratitude to our authors for offering their work to this journal. We offer our very special thanks to our reviewers who give so generously of time and expertise to review, critique, and especially provide meaningful suggestions to the author's work whether eventually accepted or rejected. Without these excellent and dedicated reviewers the quality expected from such a journal could not be possible. We also express our special thanks to our Publisher, John Wiley & Sons for their expert attention and support in the production and marketing of Artificial Organs. We look forward to reporting further advances in the coming years.

AB  - Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), manifested by intricate etiology and pathophysiology, demands careful clinical surveillance due to its high mortality and imminent life support measures. NMR based metabolomics provides an approach for ARDS which culminates from a wide spectrum of illness thereby confounding early manifestation and prognosis predictors. 1H NMR with its manifold applications in critical disease settings can unravel the biomarker of ARDS thus holding potent implications by providing surrogate endpoints of clinical utility. NMR metabolomics which is the current apogee platform of omics trilogy is contributing towards the possible panacea of ARDS by subsequent validation of biomarker credential on larger datasets. In the present review, the physiological derangements that jeopardize the whole metabolic functioning in ARDS are exploited and the biomarkers involved in progression are addressed and substantiated. The following sections of the review also outline the clinical spectrum of ARDS from the standpoint of NMR based metabolomics which is an emerging element of systems biology. ARDS is the main premise of intensivists textbook, which has been thoroughly reviewed along with its incidence, progressive stages of severity, new proposed diagnostic definition, and the preventive measures and the current pitfalls of clinical management. The advent of new therapies, the need for biomarkers, the methodology and the contemporary promising approaches needed to improve survival and address heterogeneity have also been evaluated. The review has been stepwise illustrated with potent biometrics employed to selectively pool out differential metabolites as diagnostic markers and outcome predictors. The following sections have been drafted with an objective to better understand ARDS mechanisms with predictive and precise biomarkers detected so far on the basis of underlying physiological parameters having close proximity to diseased phenotype. The aim of this review is to stimulate interest in conducting more studies to help resolve the complex heterogeneity of ARDS with biomarkers of clinical utility and relevance.

AB  - Abstract This paper draws on a qualitative study that sought to understand and develop theory based upon 24 women's subjective accounts of their childhood and adult experiences and involvement in sex work in the UK. It specifically examines the management of dual and threatened identities for the 17 women who were also mothers. To ensure the centrality of the women's voices in the analysis and theory generation, a grounded theory approach was taken using a psychosocial framework that drew on concepts of resilience to explore how the meanings of those experiences were reflectively appraised by participants. The findings indicate that there is a need to cope with the threat to identity inherent in society's diametrically opposed perceptions of sex worker and ?good mother? and simultaneously to manage the coexistence of the roles and identities of mother and sex worker. What appear significant in determining how these tensions are managed are the accumulated risk factors of early childhood, and the resources available to individuals in adulthood to manage both identities. Services must recognize not only individual but wider environmental and familial factors impacting on women with the dual identity of sex worker and mother in order to promote their resilience as mothers, whether living with or apart from their children.

AB  - Abstract Aim This article describes the development and design of the Youth Wellness Centre (YWC), an innovative, youth-friendly centre providing mental health and addiction services for emerging adults aged 17 to 25 in Hamilton, Canada. We also report on demographic and clinical characteristics of clients to evaluate how the YWC is serving populations at increased risk of developing mental disorders. Methods Data were extracted from clinic databases for 1520 youth at the YWC between March 2015 and 2018 to report on demographic characteristics, clinical profiles, primary presenting problems, service use and overall satisfaction with services. Results Marginalized groups, particularly street-involved individuals and LGBTQ+ youth, are highly represented at the YWC, keeping with the centre's mandate of reaching at-risk populations. Youth at the YWC carry significant mental health burdens, with 80.8% having a history of suicidal ideation and 32.8% having a history of a substance use disorder. The primary route of referral is self-referral and the number of new clients has increased by nearly 20% in the first 3?years of operations. Overall satisfaction with the centre is on par with or slightly above provincial averages. Conclusions The YWC was developed to meet the mental health needs of transition-aged youth in Hamilton by providing early intervention, system navigation and transition services. The success of the YWC in reaching high-risk youth is demonstrated by the significant proportion of clients reporting demographic and clinical risk factors associated with increased risk for development of mental disorders. The increasing referrals to the YWC highlight the ongoing need for similar services.

AB  - The intersubjective dialogic exercise through which identities and knowledge are constructed exists in a dialectic relation with the ?place? of the interview. The in situ nature of interviewing should not be overlooked. Two case studies of interviews conducted with older people in Britain about their social network and support are used to illuminate two aspects of the socio-spatial construction of interview data. First, interview sites can yield important information about the way participants construct their individual and social identities. Second, such identities can influence interviewer?interviewee dynamics.
