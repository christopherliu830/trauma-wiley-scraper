AB  - Abstracts As sociologists try to uncover the reasons why Kuwait was not only able to endure the oppression of the Iraqi invasion and occupation but also to recover relatively rapidly, some social institutions in the country are being explored for their value in understanding the coping strategies available within the culture. One such traditional institution is the diwaniah. This informal institution in Kuwait served as a natural and largely unchallenged survival mechanism both during historical conflicts and turmoil as well as recently during the Iraqi invasion and occupation. As a culture-wide tradition, the diwaniah, by providing the meeting places for men to discuss important political and social issues, played several significant roles during the Iraqi invasion and occupation. In this paper, the author investigates the growth of and changes within the traditional institution of the diwaniah over the years in Kuwait, describing its structure and development, and evaluating its influence and the roles it has played in Kuwait's sociopolitical history. The study includes results of a an informal survey of the roles the diwaniah has played during the last decade in the social future of the diwaniah in Kuwait is positive and promising, because its importance and traditional influence are increasing each day. While the diwaniah is a Gulf Arab tradition, it is in Kuwait that it has maintained its strength. Kuwaitis are proud of this unique institution, they see how it helped them cope with the dangers of an occupying army, and they understand that it made possible the swift recovery after the war. Therefore, it is the wish of every Kuwaiti to preserve the diwaniah for the coming generations for the welfare of the society and the individual.

AB  - Abstract Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is a paracrine-acting epithelial mitogen produced by cells of mesenchymal origin, that plays an important role in protecting and repairing epithelial tissues. Pre-clinical data initially demonstrated that a recombinant truncated KGF (palifermin) could reduce gastrointestinal injury and mortality resulting from a variety of toxic exposures. Furthermore, the use of palifermin in patients with hematological malignancies reduced the incidence and duration of severe oral mucositis experienced after intensive chemoradiotherapy. Based upon these findings, as well as the observation that KGF receptors are expressed in many, if not all, epithelial tissues, pre-clinical studies have been conducted to determine the efficacy of palifermin in protecting different epithelial tissues from toxic injury in an attempt to model various clinical situations in which it might prove to be of benefit in limiting tissue damage. In this article, we review these studies to provide the pre-clinical background for clinical trials that are described in the accompanying article and the rationale for additional clinical applications of palifermin.

AB  - Objective Suicide risk in subjects at Ultra-High Risk of psychosis (UHR) has been rarely assessed in adolescence, but it is of obvious importance for prognostic and clinical care reasons. In this study, we aimed to prospectively assess suicide risk and behaviors in UHR adolescents. Method We examined 112 help-seeking adolescents (13?18 years, 50% males, 83.9% Caucasian) that were enrolled in the Reggio Emilia At-Risk Mental States (ReARMS) project and followed up for 2 years. Specific items derived from the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States (CAARMS) and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) were used to assess suicide risk. Suicide attempts and completed suicides were also recorded. Results Baseline assessment detected 40 UHR adolescents, 32 FEP (first-episode psychosis), and 40 non-UHR/FEP. We found that 67.5% of UHR adolescents had suicidal ideation, and 18.5% to severe degree. Attempted suicide before enrollment was higher in the UHR group than in non-UHR/FEP peers (17.5% vs. 2.5%). BDI-II suicidal ideation severity was stable at 12-month follow-up and decreased at 24-month follow-up. Conclusions A high prevalence of suicidal ideation among UHR adolescents was found and supports the routine monitoring of risk of self-injurious thinking and behavior in this at-risk population.

AB  - Abstract How can the deterioration of the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) be prevented by urological nurses? The intention of this study is to examine the relevant literature regarding HRQoL among those undergoing TURP. Transurethral resection of the prostate is fully considered as a historical reference-standard procedure for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia. Even though this method is highly effective and offers significant progress in urinary functioning, it is related to a risk of complications recognized as TURP syndrome which may impact patients' HRQoL. Several studies have discussed the management of TURP syndrome; however, they did not clearly elucidate the comprehensive aspect of HRQoL pertaining to physiological and psychological elements. As a consequence, this clinical condition may cause unpromising outcomes in regard to residual physical and psychological symptoms after TURP. Wilson and Cleary's model of HRQOL was thoughtfully chosen to guide this study. Several themes of the model were discussed as follows: biological and physiological factors, symptoms and general health perceptions, functional status, patient preferences, emotional and psychological factors, and overall quality of life. We generated a model of HRQoL along with nursing care with respect to the patients undergoing TURP. The findings of this study will render a positive contribution to improving TURP outcomes as well as preventing deterioration of patients' HRQoL.

AB  - Abstract For marginalised young people, alternative education settings?referred to here as flexible learning programs (FLPs)?are thought to provide a powerful ?counter-space? to damaging experiences of mainstream schooling. Such programs are inherently contradictory, with potential to also reproduce stigma and disadvantage. The provision of secondary schooling via FLPs is significant. In Australia, for example, the sector serves over 70,000 students. A better understanding of student experiences and outcomes in these educational spaces is needed. Drawing on interview data with staff, students, and graduates from two FLPs in Victoria, this paper employs Soja's ideas about conceived, perceived, and lived space to explore what outcomes are valued and to consider how success is measured in these programs. The paper shows that FLP staff and students valued a diverse range of academic, social, and personal outcomes that support a more expansive vision of education and monitoring student success than dominant perspectives. The paper also suggests that these FLPs are both a counter-space and a space that connects back to the mainstream, optimally understood as third space, a hybrid place, bringing together the conventional and the alternative to create a valued and valuable education for marginalised young people.
