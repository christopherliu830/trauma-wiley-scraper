AB  - Faith (F) and presence (O) in psychoanalytic processes Based on an example of narcissism Based on Freud's remark that a neurosis can not be slain in absentia, the thesis is established that presence moments constitute the central points in the analytic process. The interpenetrative dynamics between analyst and analysand creates an analytical field, in which a pre-conception is formed. This pre-conception meets the self-revealing psychic world of the patient. This realization is a moment of presence (O) and the analytic third is determined. In this moment, the presence of psychic reality is irrefutable present and can be called by name. The name, which is seen as a presentational symbol, is a creation of the analytic couple, but has its source in the genetic roots of the patient. The presentational arises from the presence, which can then become the representation. F is central in this process and is part of the analytic couple. Based on detailed case material of a narcissistic disorder it is shown that a dynamic that impresses at first narcissistic, can be understood from a different point of view as a struggle for the analytical attitude and belief (F).

AB  - ABSTRACT The purpose of this research was to explore the relationship between degenerative joint disease (DJD) in the apophyseal joints and intervertebral joints in the vertebral column and assess which vertebral DJD is the more reliable indicator of general activity-related stress. We hypothesized that the more reflecting vertebral DJD for general activity-related stress would appear to show a higher correlation with Schmorl's nodes (SNs). To test this hypothesis, we examined 125 individuals from Eunpyeong Cemetery (mid-15th to early 20th centuries) in Seoul, Korea and analyzed the frequencies of two types of vertebral DJD and their relationship with SNs. Cross-tabulation chi-square tests were used to evaluate the significance of the differences between frequencies of vertebral pathologies. In conclusion, results revealed that the relationship between the two kinds of vertebral DJD appeared differently depending on vertebral region, joint type and sex. The test results of association between the two types of vertebral DJD were statistically significant at the cervical and lumbar regions of males. SNs appeared independently of the pattern of vertebral DJD in nearly all joints with the exception of a correlation between DJD in the intervertebral joints and SNs of the lumbar region in females. As indicated in some studies, this study reconfirmed that the differences in the two kinds of vertebral DJD result from differences in normal vertebral morphology and anatomical function. This study contributes to the overall discussion on the relationship between vertebral DJD and physical activity by showing that the detailed recording and understanding of the two types of vertebral DJD is required before they can be used convincingly in a study on activity-related stress.

AB  - Abstract Growing numbers of grandparent special guardians (GSGs) are assuming responsibility for increasing numbers of children in the care system in England. Special guardianship arrangements are increasingly used as a permanency option as they allow children to remain in their kinship networks rather than in local authority care or be adopted; yet there is a scarcity of research on GSG carers' experiences. This paper reports a small qualitative research study where 10 sets of grandparents were interviewed to explore their journey to becoming GSGs and to theorize their subsequent experiences. Two themes emerge. First, experiences of the assessment process are elaborated, decisions often being made at a time of family crisis, impacting on GSGs: financial, employment, and relational. Second, GSGs' experiences of managing often challenging relationships and contact arrangements between the grandchildren and the parents reveal three main relationship management approaches emerging: containing-flexible, containing-controlled, and uncontained/defeated approaches. Anthropological concepts of affinity help theorize the GSGs' ambivalent responses to becoming carers in later life, enabling reconfigured kinship relationships in new family forms. Family policy and social work practice is critiqued as GSGs appear often left alone to ?roll back the years,? to heal previous harms done to the grandchildren who end up in their care.
