AB  - Translations of summary A considerable gap exists between clinical psychoanalytic concepts and psychoanalytic practice. It can be traced back to the early beginnings of psychoanalysis and to Freud's own handling of concepts that he had developed himself. Focusing on the concept of ?transference? that Freud in several steps coined so precisely from his experiences with hysteric patients and especially from his understanding of the ?Dora? case, it can be shown that he ? seen from today ? could not fully apply the meaning of his own concept in the later treatment of the so-called ?Rat Man?. Freud's ?Original record of the case? is used to scrutinize his way of understanding and handling the transference with this patient. To a substantial extent transference as well as counter-transference was rather enacted than understood in this case, partly due to Freud's own personal and scientific interests and to his ambitions to use this case as a demonstration of his therapeutic approach. In order to show this, it is unavoidable to correct several blurry or even misleading passages of Strachey's translation. Findings from numerous workshops using ?comparative clinical methods? indicate that up till now we analysts ? like Freud ? have great difficulties in applying Freud's incredible insight that ?a whole series of former psychic experiences comes alive not as the past but as the present relationship to the person of the physician? (Freud, 1905c [1901], p. 279/280, my translation).

AB  - Summary The diabetic patient enters Stage 4 because the foot is now infected and microbiological control has been lost. Diabetic foot ulcers are very susceptible to infection, which is the main pathology that destroys most diabetic feet. Diabetic patients with foot ulcers should be assessed for the presence of infection. The most common manifestation is cellulitis. The development of infection constitutes a foot care emergency, which requires referral to specialized foot care team within 24 h. This chapter discusses antibiotic treatment, both as initial and follow-up treatment and covers treatment of the locally infected ulcer, spreading infection from the ulcer and the foot with severe deep infection. It is vital to achieve microbiological control, wound control, vascular control, mechanical control, metabolic control, and educational control. If infection is not controlled, it can spread with alarming rapidity, and can cause extensive tissue necrosis, taking the foot into Stage 5 or Stage 6.

AB  - Abstract Hypoxic hepatitis (HH), an acute liver injury also known as ?ischaemic hepatitis? or ?shock liver?, is frequently observed in intensive care units. HH is heralded by a massive but transient rise in serum aminotransferase activities caused by anoxic necrosis of centrilobular liver cells. Cardiac failure, respiratory failure and toxic-septic shock are the main underlying conditions accounting for more than 90% of cases, but HH may also occur in other circumstances. Until recently, liver ischaemia, i.e. a drop in hepatic blood flow, was considered the leading, and even the sole, hemodynamic mechanism responsible for HH, and it was generally held that a shock state was required. In reality, other hemodynamic mechanisms of hypoxia, such as passive congestion of the liver, arterial hypoxaemia and dysoxia, play an important role while a shock state is observed in only 50% of cases. Accordingly, ?ischaemic hepatitis? and ?shock liver? are misnomers. Therapy of HH depends primarily on the nature of the underlying condition. The prognosis is poor, with more than half of patients dying during the hospital stay.

AB  - Summary The term mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was introduced as a stage in the Global Deterioration Scale to describe the progression from normal aging to dementia. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the United States. The potential clinical and demographic risk factors for developing AD at an earlier age of onset identified over the last three decades include depression, female gender, low levels of education, smaller head circumference, and family history of Down's syndrome. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a synucleinopathy characterized by a progressive dementia syndrome that is usually associated with parkinsonism and typically dominated by attentional, visuospatial, and executive dysfunction and relatively preserved memory. Vascular cognitive impairment, frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive aphasia, prion diseases, and normal pressure hydrocephalus are also discussed in the chapter.

AB  - Venue: Tokyo International Forum ?Date: 16?17 June 2005 President: Professor Heii Arai (Juntendo University School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry) The 20th Annual Meeting of the Japanese Psychogeriatric Society was held in Tokyo. The meeting was co-organized with four other meetings related to gerontology. The program included one special lecture, four educational lectures, three symposiums, 74 oral presentations, and 40 poster presentations. As this meeting was co-organized with other meetings related to gerontology, participants had good opportunities to access information in the important related fields. In the special lecture entitled ?The etiology and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease?, Professor Peter St George-Hyslop presented recent findings in Alzheimer disease research on the pathological pathways, including production of amyloid beta and regulation of gamma secretase activity. It was shown that rapid progress was being made in basic research on Alzheimer's disease and this had an impact on the audience. Symposium I, ?Alcoholism and its related cognitive impairment dementia?, was chaired by Professor Kenji Kosaka and Professor Haruo Kashima; Symposium II, ?Alzheimer's disease: recent clinical challenges? was chaired by Professor Masaaki Matsushita and Professor Masatoshi Takeda; and Symposium III, ?Long-term care insurance in the psychogeriatric field? was chaired by Professor Akira Honma and Dr Yumiko Arai. All three symposiums were fruitful, with many active members being involved in exciting discussions. The next annual meeting will be held on 30 June?1 July 2006 in Tokyo, and presided by Professor Hiroo Kasahara. The 2007 meeting will be presided by Professor Yoshio Morita and will be co-organized with the 13th Congress of the International Psychogeriatric Association, chaired by Professor Masatoshi Takeda.

AB  - Summary Friendship and enmity played an important ? though often underestimated ? role in revolutionary politics. This chapter addresses the interaction between personal and political factors in the politics of the Jacobins between 1790 and 1794. It first focuses on the tension between loyalty to one's friends and the demands of the revolutionary ideology of political virtue. It then focuses on the examples of three men who, at different stages, were dominant figures in the Jacobin Club: Antoine Barnave, Jacques-Pierre Brissot, and Camille Desmoulins. The chapter investigates the ways in which their political choices and ultimate fates were intertwined with the shifting patterns of both friendship and enmity between them. Lastly, it relates these examples of individual agency to a key question about the politics of Jacobinism ? which is how it relates to the system of Terror sustained by the Jacobins from 1793 to 1794.

AB  - ABSTRACT Over the last four decades, bioarchaeology has experienced significant technical growth and theoretical maturation. Early 21st century bioarchaeology may also be enhanced from a renewed engagement with the concept of biological stress. New insights on biological stress and disease can be gained from cross-disciplinary perspectives regarding human skeletal variation and disease. First, pathophysiologic and molecular signaling mechanisms can provide more precise understandings regarding formation of pathological phenotypes in bone. Using periosteal new bone formation as an example, various mechanisms and pathways are explored in which new bone can be formed under conditions of biological stress, particularly in bone microenvironments that involve inflammatory changes. Second, insights from human biology are examined regarding some epigenetic factors and disease etiology. While epigenetic effects on stress and disease outcomes appear profoundly influential, they are mostly invisible in skeletal tissue. However, some indirect and downstream effects, such as the developmental origins of adult health outcomes, may be partially observable in bioarchaeological data. Emerging perspectives from the human microbiome are also considered. Microbiomics involves a remarkable potential to understand ancient biology, disease, and stress. Third, tools from epidemiology are examined that may aid bioarchaeologists to better cope with some of the inherent limitations of skeletal samples to better measure and quantify the expressions of skeletal stress markers. Such cross-disciplinary synergisms hopefully will promote more complete understandings of health and stress in bioarchaeological science.
