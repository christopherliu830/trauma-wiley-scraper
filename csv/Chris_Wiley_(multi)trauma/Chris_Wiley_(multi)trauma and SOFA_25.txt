AB  - This novel paper critically addresses a currently popular sex education resource which compares sexual consent to tea drinking. Drawing from a study which considered the meaning of consent through focus groups and interviews with young people and professionals, we argue that the central ?risk avoidance? message of such resources individualises the potential risks of non-consensual sex and ignores the gendered social structures which shape interpersonal relationships. We suggest that simplifying and extrapolating sexual consent from broader cultural understandings is problematic. Conversations with young people are important, but they need to address the complexity of sexual consent, coercion and gendered sexual norms.

AB  - Summary Although dental implants have been a successful option for replacement of lost dentition for nearly five decades, their use in the medical and dental treatment plan is still in its youth. Literature on the medical implications of dental implants is surprisingly sparse, with a need for organization. This chapter is an attempt to begin the process of documenting the science behind this complex, yet critical topic. Our understanding of the mechanisms of implant success, complications, and failure unfolds from documented case histories, medical data, and clinical research. Yet, as certain as the scientific facts are, there are contradictions and cases with unexpected outcomes yielding both good and bad results. Some cases exhibit outcomes that surprisingly cross the frontier of success, while others seem to head toward failure before the clinician realizes something is wrong. The later example may begin with a common systemic disorder or medical history, seemingly straightforward from the start, only to become bewildering and strenuous to manage. For these reasons we must be critical in case selection and customize treatment plans according to medical condition while managing all medical aspects with vigor, academic excellence, and due diligence. With patient selection being the critical factor for implant success or survival, the medical condition, pharmacologic implications, and overall health of the patient cannot be overemphasized. When medical conditions are managed wisely, most patients with diseases discussed in this chapter enjoy far better overall health if they enjoy the comfort and confidence of fixed prostheses rather than the struggle, discomfort, and self-awareness of dentures in an age where esthetics and self-esteem have never been more highly valued. Now more than ever, exceptional care must be exercised to ensure that every implant is placed and restored with the objective of being as successful and as safe as possible for each patient.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Inca imperial strategies of political and territorial expansion varied across conquered regions depending on local ecology and cultural resistance, and Chachapoya peoples in Peru's forested northeastern Andes were renowned for their rebellions against the invaders. The cliff tombs of Los Pinchudos (AD 1470?1535) present opportunities to use stable isotopes to: (1) explore dietary and mobility patterns from a mortuary community interred at a site attributed to the poorly-known Chachapoya culture during the period of Inca domination, and (2) explore the origins of the individuals as either local or foreign (Inca). Using biochemical tracers, we can help resolve the impact of foreign influence and changes in population and social structure during imperial occupation. Materials and Methods While it is difficult to reconstruct individual life histories from incomplete skeletons, stable isotopic analysis of multiple skeletal tissues provides a direct means of characterizing diet and residential mobility. Values of stable carbon (δ13C), nitrogen (δ15N), and oxygen isotope (δ18O) ratios were determined in bone and dentine collagen and bone and enamel carbonate from 28 samples (11 paired tissues) from males, females, and juveniles from Los Pinchudos. Results Dietary signatures are consistent with a mixed but more C3-based plant and protein-based diet with moderate proportions of terrestrial animals. Oxygen isotopic values demonstrate limited variation between paired tissues, with a few possible nonlocal individuals buried in one particular tomb at the site. Compared to other Andean areas that underwent imperial domination, these data do not demonstrate expected dietary shifts. Discussion These are the first isotopic data from a Chachapoya site and our research shows evidence for minimal non-local presence in this commingled burial assemblage. The regional diet reconstructed at Los Pinchudos (2850 masl) focused on resources of higher altitude tuber crops, beans, and grains (C3) and terrestrial protein rather than on lower elevation grasses such as maize (C4) as in other highland Andean regions under Inca control. During imperial domination, inhabitants of this region appropriated Inca materials goods but continued to construct tombs in the local manner even though a potentially diverse population was occupying them.

AB  - Introduction:? In assessing clinical change, measurement is often based on psychometric scales. However, change is best revealed within the constellation of problems salient to the patient, rather than in alterations in the abstract constructs, psychometrically measured. These patients' problems often serially unfold in qualitative stages, even before the full-blown disorder emerges. These qualitative stages constitute the natural history extending from early to late, fluctuating from mild to severe, and progressing from full-blown disorder to recovery. Method:? We reviewed the literature on clinimetrics and patient-centred subjective measures, and related these findings to the use of the discretized-analogue scaling method. Results:? There is increasing recognition of clinimetric approaches that structure the pre-clinical and clinical material into a scale that reflects the symptoms, consequences and complications in a manner understandable to the patient, and enabling the quantification of severity or change. This monograph provides criteria and methods for developing these building blocks that enable the assessment of severity, stage or change. We show examples of their use in quantitative clinical outcome measurement. Conclusion:? We encourage further studies in the ideology and procedures for measuring clinical change in terms of personally subjective experiences.

AB  - DA RIN DELLA MORA R., BAGNASCO A.  10 in the USA. The studies were divided into two categories: contextualization and prevention of the ?accident? or ?fall? phenomenon (10 studies), and fall risk assessment (three studies). The most frequent type of design was observational explorative/descriptive. Several areas of investigation were explored (hazardous environment, children's characteristics correlated to accidents/falls, characteristics of the accidents/falls and their outcomes, paediatric fall risk factors and risk assessment tools, fall risk prevention programmes, parents' perceptions of accident/fall risks, etc.). Discussion:? No comparable methods were used to investigate the contextualization and prevention of the ?accident? and ?fall? phenomena; proposed fall risk assessment tools were not evaluated for their reliability and validity. Conclusions:? Consensus would be needed around the approach to accidents in terms of: the definition of ?accident? and ?fall?; ?fall-related injury? and respective classifications; the frequency and rate calculation methods; the tools used to assess the risk of falls; and evidence-based practice aimed at preventing them.

AB  - Abstract This article argues that although the lives of young homeless people are characterized by high levels of mobility, when examined closely movement is also revealed as heavily restricted. While a network of agencies moves the young people around the city, the official borders of borough councils and the non-official territories of young people feed into an experience of London as a series of exclusionary bounded areas. Within the accounts of the young people, mobility is talked of as a resource but also in terms of loss and dislocation. The article argues for going beyond the opposition of mobility/fixity in order to examine how some people become fixed in mobility. Résumé Même si la vie des jeunes sans-abri se caractérise par une forte mobilité, tout mouvement, après examen approfondi, se révèle également très contraint. Alors qu?un réseau d?agences déplace les jeunes à travers la ville, les limites officielles des communes et les territoires informels des jeunes alimentent une expérience de Londres faite d?un ensemble de zones d?exclusion bien délimitées. Dans les récits des jeunes, la mobilité est traitée comme une ressource, mais aussi en termes de perte et de rupture géographique. Il conviendrait de dépasser l?opposition entre mobilité et fixité pour examiner comment certains jeunes se retrouvent ?figés? dans leur mobilité.

AB  - Abstract:? This paper considers a key academic support of US geopolitics overseas, which I term the ?military?strategic studies complex?. The paper begins by outlining the development of Strategic Studies in the US since the early 1980s. It then uses the example of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments to work through a discussion of the palpable agency of the military?strategic studies complex in advancing a dual military?economic securitization strategy for what it calls the contemporary American ?leasehold empire?. This strategy is focused especially on the Persian Gulf and involves both an enduring US military presence and long-term neoliberal designs for the region. Finally, consideration is given to alternative military?strategic visions before attention is turned to the task of Geography in countering US geopolitical and geoeconomic scriptings of the Middle East, all expedited under a vernacular of ?national security?.

AB  - Abstract Allergic contact dermatitis is the classic delayed hypersensitivity reaction, developing in two phases ? sensitization and elicitation. It can have profound effects on affected individuals and may result in sickness, absence from work and increased health expense. Its diagnosis requires consideration of many factors including the patient's history and a physical examination; knowledge of the skin's reaction to various chemicals is also desirable. Above all, it requires a high degree of suspicion on the part of the clinician and tenacity, skill and experience in the investigator. The diagnosis can only be confirmed by interpreting patch test results and the technique in itself has many pitfalls for the unwary. Any sensitization identified needs to be put into the context of a past or present dermatitis, and explanations for allergen avoidance or substitution need to be provided for the patient.
