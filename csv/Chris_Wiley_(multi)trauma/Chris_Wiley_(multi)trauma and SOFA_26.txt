AB  - Abstract Background Improving email writing in people with aphasia could enhance their ability to communicate, promote interaction and reduce isolation. Spelling therapies have been effective in improving single-word writing. However, there has been limited evidence on how to achieve changes to everyday writing tasks such as email writing in people with aphasia. One potential area that has been largely unexplored in the literature is the potential use of assistive writing technologies, despite some initial evidence that assistive writing software use can lead to qualitative and quantitative improvements to spontaneous writing. Aims This within-participants case series design study aimed to investigate the effects of using assistive writing software to improve email writing in participants with dysgraphia related to aphasia. Methods  while four participants showed noteworthy changes to the range of word classes used. Enhanced independence in email use and improvements in participants? perceptions of their writing skills were also noted. Conclusions & Implications This study provided some initial evidence that assistive writing technologies can support people with aphasia in email writing across a range of important performance parameters. However, more research is needed to measure the effects of these technologies on the writing of people with aphasia, and to determine the optimal compensatory mechanisms for specific people given the linguistic?strategic resources they bring to the task of email writing.

AB  - The volume of medical literature in the management of cardiovascular diseases has continued to grow exponentially. It is important for clinical practitioners to keep informed in order to provide optimal patient care. We compiled a list of pertinent clinical trials, as well as well-written, up-to-date review articles and important treatment guidelines, that focus on the management of cardiac arrhythmias. This list is an update to a previous list published in Pharmacotherapy in 2004. This article should be useful not only to practitioners and trainees in cardiovascular pharmacotherapy, but to other clinicians as well.

AB  - Objective. To explore the impact of statewide public reporting of hospital patient satisfaction on hospital quality improvement (QI), using Rhode Island (RI) as a case example. Data Source. Primary data collected through semi-structured interviews between September 2002 and January 2003. Study Design. The design is a retrospective study of hospital executives at all 11 general and two specialty hospitals in RI. Respondents were asked about hospital QI activities at several points throughout the public reporting process, as well as about hospital structure and processes to accomplish QI. Qualitative analysis of the interview data proceeded through an iterative process to identify themes and categories in the data. Principal Findings. Data from the standardized statewide patient satisfaction survey process were used by hospitals to identify and target new QI initiatives, evaluate performance, and monitor progress. While all hospitals fully participated in the public reporting process, they varied in the stage of development of their QI activities and adoption of the statewide standardized survey for ongoing monitoring of their QI programs. Most hospitals placed responsibility for QI within each department, with results reported to top management, who were perceived as giving strong support for QI. The external environment facilitated QI efforts. Conclusion. Public reporting of comparative data on patient views can enhance and reinforce QI efforts in hospitals. The participation of key stakeholders facilitated successful implementation of statewide public reporting. This experience in RI offers lessons for other states or regions as they move to public reporting of hospital quality data.

PY  - 2018
AB  - The logic, meaning, and functioning of public spaces differ substantially between cultures and places. While Western public spaces are affected by democratic urban regimes and enhanced commercialisation, public spaces in traditional Muslim, Middle Eastern cities that were originally supervised by the community according to cultural norms are not easily adapted to contemporary changes. This paper thus analyses the unique case of Palestinian Israeli towns, reflecting the coexistence of these two sets of ruling public spaces, also affected by global economic changes and national political complexities. These towns consist of two different built environments: old neighbourhoods based on hierarchic, socially affiliated public spaces and new neighbourhoods created by the Israeli modern planning system, strictly dividing public spaces from private ones. The analysis provides a comparative framework discussing how this emerging urban condition affects the performance of public spaces. In addition, it enables a new perspective on Palestinian society, torn between tradition and Westernisation.

PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract Mothers and infants sleeping within proximity to each other (co-sleeping) represents normal, healthy, and expectable human behaviour, especially if mothers breastfeed. Yet, western health officials generally recommend against particularly one form of co-sleeping known as bedsharing. This study explores these issues and especially highlights parental accounts of their sleep practices, interpretations, and reflections based on detailed narratives or ?ethnohistories.? The sample involves a self-selected sub-group of over 200 mostly middle-class mothers from Canada, the United States, Australia, and Great Britain. Mothers report how and why they adopted co-sleeping practices, how satisfied they are (or were) with their decisions, and what benefits they think they or their infants derived from their co-sleeping practices. Also included in the reports are a surprisingly high number of parents who think they may have saved their infant's life by bedsharing, data heretofore never reported in the literature. The formulation of medical policies, we suggest, ultimately must be informed by a full understanding of how parents actually think about and subsequently structure their infant's sleep, what their goals and expectations are, and by an awareness of the emotional factors motivating parents to choose certain sleeping arrangements over others. The results reveal that many factors coalesce, often in unique ways, under unique circumstances, family by family, to determine where babies sleep and why. We conclude that sleeping arrangements are not solely determined by medically based recommendations, but also by the method of feeding, the particular needs of a particular infant, and the needs of mothers and fathers to get more sleep. While baby sleep locations and sleep patterns change in the first year of life, nighttime sleeping arrangements almost always reflect the nature of family values and the quality of social relationships at any given time. We conclude that these factors, alongside widely known independent SIDS risk factors, must also be acknowledged and respected if we are ever to achieve an effective and inclusive public health approach to the question of creating safe sleep environments for infants and children.

AB  - This paper explores connections that can be made between houses, homes and violence in Palestine, and representational consequences of making such connections. Drawing on ethnographic field research in Birzeit, I put recent work on critical geographies of home into conversation with geographies and geopolitics of Palestine. I criticise the tendency to represent Palestinian geographies almost entirely through the lens of the Israeli Occupation. While such studies have a great deal of value both academically and politically, this paper augments such work by developing a different focus and a different representational approach. I use detailed ethnographic vignettes and interviews to engage with the domestic practices that make particular Birzeiti homes. These intimate domestic encounters underpin my argument that there is a need for more work that apprehends Palestinian geographies as complexities that bear a relation to, but are not fully determined by, the Israeli Occupation.

The 1,990 titles, received from 87 institutions, are listed by subject-matter area and degree for each year; and the author, institution, and availability of the document are reported. Information about graduate research in home economics is summarized through presentations of totals for each in stitution, by subject matter categories, and through rankings for the institutions reporting the largest number of theses and dissertations. Of all the titles, 25 percent were for dissertations for both years. For both years, the largest number of titles was reported nutrition, while family relations and child development ranked second.
