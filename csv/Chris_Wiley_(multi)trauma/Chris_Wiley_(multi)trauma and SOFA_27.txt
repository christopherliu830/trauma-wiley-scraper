AB  - Summary With the help of several grids, this chapter explains the possibilities and the diversity within green marketing. Just having a framework is extremely useful in avoiding confusing and conflating different approaches. No one suggests that any one of those approaches within the grid is better. One may note that a green substitute product such as an electric sports car set a new standard in the motor industry but was given a straightforward marketing sell on its individual benefits; for example, the coolness of sci-fi technology to geeks could still be the greenest approach in totality. The next ten years will see new revolutionary ideas in smart eco-homes, travel, retailing, working patterns and quite possibly in government regulation and taxation as well. All such changes may add up to a dramatically greener way of life. Green products often have secondary benefits that can be used to sell them. They can be more efficient, durable, affordable, basic, healthier, better made or more indulgent like the premium brands.
