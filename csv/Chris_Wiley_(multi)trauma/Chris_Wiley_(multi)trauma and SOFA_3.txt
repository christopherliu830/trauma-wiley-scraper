AB  - Endothelial activation is pivotal in the development and escalation of sepsis. Central to endothelial activation is the endothelial up-regulation of cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs) including E-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and PECAM-1. Shed CAMs are also found in circulating soluble forms (sCAMs). We investigated whether sCAMs can be used as biomarkers for the differentiation between septic and non-septic patients. Furthermore, we investigated lymphocyte and monocyte expression of LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) and VLA-4 (CD49d/CD29) ligands for ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, respectively. Twenty-one septic and 15 critically ill non-septic patients were included. All patients had an APACHE II score above 13 at ICU admission. Fifteen healthy volunteers served as controls. Flow cytometry was used to estimate levels of sE-selectin, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, sPECAM-1, and the cellular expression of CD11a and CD49d. Levels of sE-selectin, sICAM-1 and sPECAM-1 were higher in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients and controls at admission and during the observation period. Lymphocyte and monocyte expression of CD11a and CD49d was suppressed or unaltered in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients and controls. Levels of sE-selectin, sICAM-1, and sPECAM-1 were able to discriminate between septic and non-septic patients, indicating that sCAMs may be potential diagnostic biomarkers of sepsis.

AB  - Aim An index that accurately measures intravascular volume is paramount for the optimal resuscitation of sepsis. Selecting an adequate indicator to substitute for central venous pressure (CVP) has remained an issue. The objective of our study was to compare the usefulness of standard early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) with CVP (EGDT-CVP) and modified EGDT with global end-diastolic volume index (GEDI; EGDT-GEDI) for sepsis. Methods This was a multicenter prospective randomized controlled study. All patients with sepsis who were expected to require mechanical ventilator support for a minimum of 48 h were included. The patients were classified into an EGDT-CVP group and an EGDT-GEDI group. All participants underwent the extubation protocol. The primary outcome was the ventilator-free days over a 28-day period. Results The ventilator-free days was not significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.59). However, the EGDT-GEDI group showed a trend of shorter ventilator support duration (5.1 days [2.0?8.7 days] versus 3.9 days [2.4?5.7 days], P = 0.27) and length of stay in the intensive care unit (7.2 days [3.8?10.7 days] versus 5.1 days [3.7?8.8 days], P = 0.05) and a smaller 3-day infusion balance than the EGDT-CVP group (4,405 mL [1,092?8,163 mL] versus 3,046 mL [830?6,806 mL], P = 0.34), but the differences were not statistically significant. Conclusion Although there was no significant efficacy, EGDT guided by GEDI showed a trend of shorter length of stay in the intensive care unit and lower 3-day infusion balance than the EGDT-CVP group in sepsis. The GEDI monitoring did not appear to improve the ventilator-free days over a 28-day period.

AB  - Abstract Objective To assess whether the initiation of vasopressor infusions via peripheral venous catheters (PVC) compared to central venous catheters (CVC) in ED patients with early septic shock was associated with differences in processes of care and outcomes. Methods We conducted a post-hoc analysis of the ARISE trial. We compared participants who had a vasopressor infusion first commenced via a PVC versus a CVC. The primary outcome was 90 day mortality. Results We studied 937 participants. Of these, 389 (42%) had early vasopressor infusion commenced via a PVC and 548 (58%) via a CVC. Trial participants who received a vasopressor infusion via a PVC were more severely ill, with higher median (interquartile range [IQR]) Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores (17 [13?23] versus 16 [12?21], P = 0.003), and higher median (IQR) lactate (mmol/L) (3.6 [1.9?5.8] versus 2.5 [1.5?4.5], P?<?0.001). After adjusting for baseline covariates, the estimated odds ratio for mortality for PVC-treated patients was 1.26 (95% confidence interval 0.95?1.67, P = 0.11). Trial participants who had vasopressors commenced via PVC had a shorter median (IQR) time to commencement of antimicrobials (55 [32?96] versus 71.5 [39?119] min, P?<?0.001) and a shorter median (IQR) time to commencement of vasopressors (2.4 [1.3?3.9] versus 4.9 [3.5?6.6] h, P?<?0.001). Conclusion The practice of commencing a vasopressor infusion via a PVC was common in the ARISE trial and more frequent in trial participants with higher severity of illness. Commencement of a vasopressor infusion via a PVC was associated with some improvements in processes of care and, after adjustment, was not associated with an increased risk of death.

AB  - Summary This chapter summarizes assessment and management of the patient with sepsis. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory, cellular and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than sepsis alone. Management of sepsis requires invasive monitoring and critical care expertise. Arterial and central venous monitoring will be required if the patient is in septic shock or once in the ICU but placement should not delay initial priorities. The first priority is adequate fluid resuscitation, using a balanced crystalloid. This should be guided by a clinical assessment of the circulation and tissue perfusion. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in sepsis and is associated with a worse outcome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a complication of sepsis. This should be suspected in patients with sepsis and also in patients with septic shock who develop purpura, prolonged oozing from puncture sites or bleeding from the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between the psychoanalytic concept of object relations and real life behavior of being in an intimate relationship among heterosexual women. In a multi-method approach we used two different measures; the self-report Bell Object Relations and Reality Testing Inventory (BORRTI; Bell, Billington & Becker, ) and the performance based Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) Social Cognition & Object Relations Scale- Global Rating Method SCORS-G (Westen, ) to measure the object relations of 60 women. The Alienation subscale of the BORRTI and understanding of social causality subscale of the SCORS-G explained 34.8% of variance of the intimate relationship variable. Thus, women involved in a romantic relationship reported lower rates of alienation on the BORRTI and produced TAT narratives that were more adaptive with regard to understanding of social causality as measured by the SCORS-G than those not currently in a relationship. Results are discussed with reference to the relationship between object relations and real life measures of healthy individuals and in light of the need for a multi-method approach of assessment.

AB  - Abstract Objective To provide a current review of the clinical characteristics, predictors and outcomes in critically ill patients presenting to the ED with acute pancreatitis and subsequently admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary referral centre in Australia. Methods A retrospective single-centre study of adult patients admitted with pancreatitis. Severe acute pancreatitis defined by Bedside Index of Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) score ≥2. Results Eighty-seven patients fulfilled criteria for inclusion during the study period, representing 0.9% of all ICU admissions. The median age of patients was 54. Survival was independent of patients? age, sex, aetiology and comorbidities. Mortality was 30.8% for both inpatient referrals to the ICU and for direct referrals via the ED. Higher mortality was identified among patients requiring mechanical ventilation (74.2 vs 24.6% in survivors; P?<?0.0001), vasopressor support (85.7 vs 33.8% in survivors; P?<?0.0001) or renal replacement therapy (60 vs 16.9% in survivors; P?<?0.002). BISAP score surpasses Ranson's and Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Examination (APACHE) II scores in discriminating between survivors and non-survivors among unselected patients with acute pancreatitis admitted to ICU, whereas APACHE II discriminates better in the cohort admitted from ED. Conclusion Severe acute pancreatitis is associated with high mortality. Aetiology and comorbidity did not predict adverse outcomes in this population. BISAP score is non-inferior to APACHE II score as a prognostic tool in critically ill patients with acute pancreatitis and could be used to triage admission. Evidence of persistent organ dysfunction and requirements for organ support reliably identify patients at high-risk of death.

AB  - On 1 May 2007, a new hotel opened in Berlin: Ostel. As its name implies, it is located in the former East of the city, now ?Berlin Mitte?. The Ostel joined Berlin's burgeoning hotel scene at a time when Ostalgie - the supposed longing East Germans feel for the past - marked no longer a condition of mourning and loss but had become ?hip?. In this article to carry the analysis of Ostalgie beyond the themes of trauma or resistance into the more playful dimensions of what Czech-French writer Milan Kundera (1992) has called ?the joke,? that is, an ironic form of humor ubiquitous in former Soviet and East European contexts. I engage irony as a situated experience and practice chiefly through the ?artful lens? of material culture. In focusing on the Ostel's interior, I am especially interested in irony's ?critical edge?. I argue that it is this edge that makes it possible to open up critical interpretations of German post-unification history.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) in unselected critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). Methods: Prospective, observational cohort study in 25 intensive care units in Finland. This study included a total of 602 patients with laboratory samples from 958 consecutive patients with ARF treated either with invasive or with non-invasive ventilatory support (the FINNALI study). Plasma NT-pro-BNP samples were drawn after the onset of ventilatory support (day 0) and on the morning of the second day. Results: The median [interquartile ranges (IQR)] NT-pro-BNP-values were significantly higher at baseline in 90-day non-survivors than the survivors, 4378?pg/ml (1400?13,943?pg/ml) vs. 1052?pg/ml (232?4076?pg/ml), respectively. The median (IQR) NT-pro-BNP values were significantly higher in patients with chronic cardiac disease or cardiac surgery than in non-cardiac patients, 1947?pg/ml (801?4687?pg/ml) vs. 417?pg/ml (153?1735?pg/ml), respectively, if renal function was normal. With deteriorating renal function, the NT-pro-BNP values showed a significant increase. The area under curve for baseline NT-pro-BNP predicting 90-day mortality was moderate: 0.718 (95% confidence interval 0.674?0.761). Baseline NT-pro-BNP over 1765?pg/ml was independently associated with 90-day mortality by logistic regression analysis (P<0.001). Conclusions: NT-pro-BNP on admission is commonly elevated and independently associated with 90-day mortality in critically ill ARF patients. However, the routine use of NT-pro-BNP for prognostic purpose does not seem to add value to clinical data in ARF patients.

AB  - Abstract Sepsis is characterized by activation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems as a response to infection. During sepsis, the expression of surface receptors expressed on immune competent cells, such as NKG2D and NKp30 on NK cells and TLR4 and CD14 on monocytes, is partly regulated by pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. In this observational study, we aimed to explore whether the expression of these receptors could be used as diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers in sepsis. Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock (n = 21) were compared with critically ill non-septic patients (n = 15). Healthy volunteers (n = 15) served as controls. To elucidate variations over time, all patients were followed for 4 days. Cell surface expression of NKG2D, NKp30, TLR4 and CD14 and serum levels of IL-1?, IL-6, IFN-?, TNF-α, IL-4 and IL-10 was estimated by flow cytometry. We found that NK cell expression of NKG2D and monocyte expression of CD14 were lower in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients, both at ICU admission and during the observation period (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). Both at ICU admission, and during the observation period, levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were higher in the septic patients compared with the non-septic patients (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Conclusion: As both NKG2D and CD14 levels appear to distinguish between septic and non-septic patients, both NKG2D and CD14 may be considered potential diagnostic biomarkers of severe sepsis and septic shock.

AB  - Summary Acute-on chronic liver failure (ACLF), a clinical syndrome associated with a dismal prognosis, occurs acutely in patients with chronic liver disease. An important feature of this syndrome is the potential for reversibility if it is recognized early and supportive measures are instituted before multi-organ failure ensues. There have therefore been recent efforts to better define and understand the pathophysiologic basis of the condition so as to aid early diagnosis and management. In this chapter, we aim to review the most recent data on the definition, pathophysiology, clinical features and management of ACLF.

AB  - Sepsis with multi organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is the most common cause of death in patients in noncoronary intensive care units. Currently, there are no specific treatments that reduce mortality in patients with sepsis and MODS. We report three patients who received therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) for sepsis with MODS who completely recovered. The first patient, a 3-year-old male presented with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-associated respiratory, renal, coagulation, hepatic, and neurologic dysfunction. After 5 TPEs, the patient fully recovered. The second patient was a 36-year-old pregnant female who developed MODS at 22 weeks of gestation. She had developed respiratory, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, neurologic, and coagulation dysfunction following pneumonia and concurrent urinary tract infection resulting in an intrauterine fetal demise. After 8 TPEs, the patient was discharged home with only mild residual hepatic dysfunction. The third patient, a 50-year-old female with a history of seizure disorder, was found unresponsive in over 100°F heat and diagnosed with Staphylococcus aureus-associated MODS. Her respiratory, coagulation, neurologic, renal, and hepatic systems were affected. The patient underwent 6 TPEs after which she had marked improvement. In conclusion, TPE may be an effective adjunct therapy in MODS by possibly removing toxic mediators and replacing deficient factors using donor plasma. J. Clin.

AB  - Abstract Inflammatory response leading to organ dysfunction and failure continues to be the major problem after injury in many clinical conditions such as sepsis, severe burns, acute pancreatitis, haemorrhagic shock, and trauma. In general terms, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is an entirely normal response to injury. Systemic leukocyte activation, however, is a direct consequence of a SIRS and if excessive, can lead to distant organ damage and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). When SIRS leads to MODS and organ failure, the mortality becomes high and can be more than 50%. Acute lung injury that clinically manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major component of MODS of various aetiologies. Inflammatory mediators play a key role in the pathogenesis of ARDS, which is the primary cause of death in these conditions. This review summarizes recent studies that demonstrate the critical role played by inflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1?, IL-6, platelet activating factor (PAF), IL-10, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), C5a, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, substance P, chemokines, VEGF, IGF-I, KGF, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in the pathogenesis of ARDS. It is reasonable to speculate that elucidation of the key mediators in ARDS coupled with the discovery of specific inhibitors would make it possible to develop clinically effective anti-inflammatory therapy.
