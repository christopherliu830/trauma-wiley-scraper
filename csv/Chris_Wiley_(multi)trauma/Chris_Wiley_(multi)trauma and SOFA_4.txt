AB  - Abstract Evaluation of alleged sexual abuse at day-care centres usually has to be based mainly on child statements about their own victimisation. This study points at other possible sources of information. Thus, the child may give contributions to the investigative procedure also as a witness of abuse of other children, as a participator of group interaction related to abuse and as a receiver of a disclosure about abuse from another child. Data are presented from a case where the suspect had confessed. A quarter of the children at the day-care centre had given information about other children's exposure. For more than half of the children, there were witness statements that reflected what these particular children might have been exposed to. Context and statement characteristics seemed to make an evaluation of some of these statements possible. Information about interaction between children and about disclosures between children was strikingly scarce which was probably due to the lack of questions from parents and investigators in these areas. Witness statements from children about other children's exposure to abuse stand out as an interesting complementary source of information in investigations of abuse at day-care centres and may also provide a basis for interpretations at a group level.

AB  - Trace elements are essential for many physiologic processes. In recent years, supplementation has been studied for a variety of indications, including glycemic control, wound healing, antioxidant effect, and anemia. Critical illness, especially states such as burns, traumas, and septic shock, is associated with inflammatory and oxidative stress, immune dysfunction, and malnutrition. In these patients, enteral and parenteral nutrition or pharmaceutical supplementation is used to provide essential macronutrients, including trace elements. The purpose of this review is to describe trace element supplementation, including iron, copper, chromium, manganese, selenium, and zinc, and highlight their mechanism, pharmacology, outcome data, and adverse effects.

AB  - A study of veterinarians' perceptions, and experience, of non-accidental injury (NAI) to pets was undertaken using an anonymous questionnaire distributed to a random sample of 1000 small animal practitioners in the UK. NAI was acknowledged by 91-3 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval, 88-2 to 93-9 per cent) of the 404 respondents who returned questionnaires, of whom 48-3 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval, 43-4 to 53-1 per cent) had either suspected or seen NAI. Four hundred and forty-eight cases were documented, predominantly in dogs (243) and cats (182). Factors either raising suspicion, or facilitating recognition, of NAI included: implication of a particular person, features of the history, referral agency involvement, behaviour of the owner and/or the animal, nature of the injuries, and socioeconomic class of owners. Additionally, sexual abuse and suspected cases of Munchausen syndrome by proxy were recorded.

AB  - Summary Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory response to pancreatic injury., The response can be mild and local, or extend to peripancreatic and systemic inflammation. The systemic inflammatory response can also lead to vascular leak, pulmonary edema, hypovolemia hypotension and shock, and ischemic injury to the pancreas, kidney and intestines. The most common etiologies of acute pancreatitis are gallstones, alcoholism, and idiopathic. Treatment is initially aimed at fluid resuscitation, support of organ dysfunction, and in severe cases enteral feeding. Therapeutic endoscopy may be needed to dislodge an impacted gallstone to treat bacterial cholangitis. Treatment is supportive, and a plan to prevent recurrence should be implemented before discharge.

AB  - Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2010; 32: 233?243 Summary Background? Hospital admissions for cirrhosis have been increasing in the United Kingdom, leading to increased pressure on intensive care (ICU) services. Outcome data for patients admitted to ICU are currently limited to transplant centre reports, with mortality rates exceeding 70%. These tertiary reports could fuel a negative bias when patients with cirrhosis are reviewed for ICU admission in secondary care. Aims? To determine whether disease severity and mortality rates in non-transplant general ICU are less severe than those reported by tertiary datasets. Methods? A prospective dual-centre non-transplant ICU study. Admissions were screened for cirrhosis and physiological and biochemical data were collected. Disease-specific and critical illness scoring systems were evaluated. Results? Cirrhosis was present in 137/4198 (3.3%) of ICU admissions. ICU and hospital mortality were 38% and 47%, respectively; median age 50 [43?59] years, 68% men, 72% alcoholic cirrhosis, median Child Pugh Score (CPS) 10 [8?11], Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) 18 [12?24], Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (APACHE II) 16 [13?22]. Conclusions? Mortality rates and disease staging were notably lower than in the published literature, suggesting that patients have a more favourable outlook than previously considered. Transplant centre data should therefore be interpreted with caution when evaluating the merits of intensive care admission for patients in general secondary care ICUs.

AB  - Summary Background Acute liver failure (ALF) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Studies have implicated the immune response, especially monocyte/macrophages as being important in dictating outcome. Aim To investigate changes in the circulating monocytes and other immune cells serially in patients with ALF, relate these with cytokine concentrations, monocyte gene expression and patient outcome. Methods In a prospective case?control study in the Scottish Liver Transplant Unit, Royal Infirmary Edinburgh, 35 consecutive patients admitted with paracetamol-induced liver failure (POD-ALF), 10 patients with non-paracetamol causes of ALF and 16 controls were recruited. The peripheral blood monocyte phenotype was analysed by flow cytometry, circulating cytokines quantified by protein array and monocyte gene expression array performed and related to outcome. Results On admission, patients with worst outcomes after POD-ALF had a significant monocytopenia, characterised by reduced classical and expanded intermediate monocyte population. This was associated with reduced circulating lymphocytes and natural killer cells, peripheral cytokine patterns suggestive of a ?cytokine storm? and increased concentrations of cytokines associated with monocyte egress from the bone marrow. Gene expression array did not differentiate patient outcome. At day 4, there was no significant difference in monocyte, lymphocyte or natural killer cells between survivors and the patients with adverse outcomes. Conclusions Severe paracetamol liver failure is associated with profound changes in the peripheral blood compartment, particularly in monocytes, related with worse outcomes. This is not seen in patients with non-paracetamol-induced liver failure. Significant monocytopenia on admission may allow earlier clarification of prognosis, and it highlights a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Aim Meta-analyses indicate positive effects of both antipsychotic and cognitive-behavioural interventions in subjects clinically at high risk (CHR) for psychosis in terms of a delay or prevention of psychotic disorders. However, these effects have been limited regarding social functioning and the relative efficacy of both types of interventions remains unclear. Furthermore, neuroprotective substances seem to be a promising alternative agent in psychosis-prevention as they are associated with few and weak side-effects. Methods In this multi-centre randomized controlled trial (RCT), we investigate the effects of two interventions on transition to psychosis and social functioning: (a) an integrated preventive psychological intervention (IPPI) including stress-/symptom-management and social-cognitive remediation; (b) N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) as a pharmacological intervention with glutamatergic, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory capabilities. Results This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT with regard to NAC and a single-blind RCT with regard to IPPI using a 2 ? 2-factorial design to investigate the individual and combined preventive effects of both interventions. To this aim, a total of 200 CHR subjects will be randomized stratified by site to one of four conditions: (a) IPPI and NAC; (b) IPPI and Placebo; (c) NAC and psychological stress management; (d) Placebo and psychological stress management. Interventions are delivered over 26?weeks with a follow-up period of 12?months. Conclusion This paper reports on the rationale and protocol of an indicated prevention trial to detect the most effective and tolerable interventions with regard to transition to psychosis as well as improvements in social functioning, and to evaluate the synergistic effects of these interventions.

AB  - Abstract Significant tension surrounds the application of antibiotics in suspected infection. Guidelines stress the importance of early empirical broad-spectrum therapy, with select observational data suggesting inferior outcomes when this is delayed. In contrast, microbiological resistance is an ever increasing global problem, with many advocating for a more restricted, culture-driven approach to antibiotic prescription. Controlled trial data are urgently needed, although many clinicians would find withholding of antibiotic therapy unethical. A trial of prehospital antibiotic administration (by paramedics) in patients with suspected sepsis would therefore provide crucial data, and go a long way to determining whether earlier empirical therapy does actually improve outcomes.

AB  - Abstract The incidence of hypoxic liver injury, most commonly referred to as hypoxic hepatitis (HH), is up to 10% in critically ill patients. In the majority of cases, HH occurs as a consequence of haemodynamic impairment following cardiogenic or septic shock. A marked, dramatic increase in the aminotransferase levels in a setting of cardiocirculatory failure is the key characteristic of HH. HH may contribute to several complications such as hepatopulmonary syndrome and hypoglycaemia. The overall mortality after the onset of HH is approximately 50?60% within 1 month. We report a case of severe HH that was successfully bridged using the Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System. In addition to the possible effects of extracorporeal liver support devices, the recognition of HH and therapy of the underlying disease that led to the occurrence of HH is of central importance.

AB  - In September 1997, sexual abuse at a Swedish daycare centre was disclosed. The suspect, a male member of the staff, admitted having abused six children. A total of 30 children were included in the police investigation. In this study, these cases were evaluated individually using a child psychiatric method. Information was collected from the police investigation and from interviews with parents. The conclusions?categorized as ?abuse likely?, ?abuse conceivable? or ?abuse uncertain??were compared with the children's own reports, the legal evaluations and the confessions of the suspects. Conclusions: The correspondence of child reports with child psychiatric evaluations was fairly high, indicating that child reports may serve as a good screening indicator of abuse. There was little agreement between child psychiatric evaluations and legal decisions, which were based on the reports of suspects. Some differences may be explained by varied methodology, definitions and criteria. Others reflect real differences in opinion. Our study illustrates the need to establish legal criteria for statements from pre-schoolers if such evidence is to constitute the basis of a ruling without a confession. Studies comparing professional psychological assessments of children's statements about sexual abuse with independent data stand out as an important line of research for the future.

AB  - Abstract Self-care, which refers to what people do to prevent disease and maintain good health, can alleviate negative health consequences of people experiencing homelessness. The aim of the study was to apply a theoretically informed approach in exploring engagement of people experiencing homelessness in self-care and to identify factors that can be targeted in future health and social care interventions. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 28 participants opportunistically recruited from a specialist homelessness healthcare centre of North East Scotland, the United Kingdom (UK). An interview schedule was developed based on the theoretical domains framework (TDF). Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Six aspects of self-care were explored, including (a) self-awareness of physical and mental health, (b) health literacy, including health seeking behaviour, (c) healthy eating, (d) risk avoidance or mitigation, (v) physical activity and sleep and (e) maintaining personal hygiene. Thematic analysis was conducted by two independent researchers following the Framework Approach. Participants described low engagement in self-care. Most of the barriers to engagement in self-care by participants were related to 'environmental context and resources' domain of TDF. Participants often resorted to stealing or begging for food. Many perceived having low health literacy to interpret health-related information. Visits to churches and charities to get a shower or to obtain free meals were commonplace. Participants expressed pessimism that there was ?nothing? they could do to improve their health and described perceived barriers often too big for them to overcome. Alienation, lack of social support and the perception that they had done irreversible damage to their health prevented their involvement in self-care. The theme of ?social circle? held examples of both enabler and barriers in participants? uptake of risky behaviours. Health and social services should work with persons experiencing homelessness in designing and delivering targeted interventions that address contextual barriers, multi-morbidity, health literacy and self-efficacy.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that exogenous protein/amino acid supplementation has the potential to improve the recovery of critically ill patients. After a careful review of the published evidence, experts have concluded that critically ill patients should receive up to 2.0?2.5 g/kg/d of protein. Despite this, however, recent review of current International Nutrition Survey data suggests that protein in critically ill patients is underprescribed and grossly underdelivered. Furthermore, the survey suggests that most of protein administration comes from enteral nutrition (EN) despite the availability of products and protocols that enhance the delivery of protein/amino acids in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. While future research clarifies the dose, timing, and composition for exogenous protein administration, as well as identification of patients who will benefit the most, ongoing process improvement initiatives should target a concerted effort to increase protein intake in the critically ill. This assertion follows from the notion that current patients are possibly being harmed while we wait for confirmatory evidence. Further research should also develop better tools to enable bedside practitioners to monitor optimal or adequate protein intake for individual patients. Finally, exploring the effect of combining adequate protein delivery with early mobility and/or resistance exercise in the ICU setting has the greatest potential for improving the functional outcomes of survivors of critical illness and warrants further study.

AB  - Abstract Aims:? Studies conducted in first-episode psychosis (FEP) samples avoid many biases. However, very few studies are based on epidemiological cohorts treated in specialized FEP services. The aim of this file audit study was to examine premorbid and baseline characteristics of a large epidemiological sample of FEP. Methods:? File audit study of all patients admitted to the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre between 1998 and 2000 using a specialized questionnaire. Results:? There were 661 patient files included in the study. Premorbid evaluation revealed high rates of substance use disorder (74.1%), history of psychiatric disorder (47.5%), past traumatic events (82.7%) suicide attempts (14.3%) and family history of psychiatric illness (55.6%). Baseline characteristics revealed high intensity of illness (mean CGI 5.5), high prevalence of lack of insight (62%) and high rate of comorbidity (70%). Conclusion:? High rates of traumatic events or episodes of mental illness before treatment for FEP must be considered when designing treatment approaches because a too narrow focus on positive psychotic symptoms will inevitably lead to incomplete treatment. Additionally, early intervention programmes need sufficient range of resources to address the multiple challenges presented by FEP patients such as high severity of illness, comorbidities and functional impairment. Finally, observation of an important degree of functional impairment despite short duration of untreated psychosis suggests that while early detection of FEP is a necessary step in early intervention, it may not be sufficient to improve functional recovery in psychosis and that efforts aimed at identifying people during the prodromal phase of psychotic disorders should be pursued.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aim:? Despite significant advances in medical management and therapeutics, acute kidney injury (AKI) is still a common and serious complication with high morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients, especially in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The primary purpose of this study is to apply the definition proposed by the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) to investigate the incidence, 28-day mortality and risk factors for the prognosis of AKI in ICU. Methods:? In this retrospective study, data from a cohort of 4642 patients admitted to five ICUs were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate the risk factors for prognosis of AKI. Results:? A total of 1036 patients were enrolled. AKI occurred in 353 of them (34.1%) under the AKIN criteria and the mortality was 54.4%. Multivariable analysis showed that variables related to the prognosis of AKI were: four or more (≥4) organ failed systems (odds ratio (OR)?=?25.612), AKI III (OR?=?14.441), AKI II (OR?=?4.491), mechanical ventilation (OR?=?7.201), sepsis (OR?=?4.552), severe acute pancreatitis (OR?=?3.299), base serum creatinine (OR?=?1.004) and the length of stay in ICU (OR?=?1.050). Conclusions:? For critically ill patient, the ICU mortality of AKI was correlated with various independent risk factors, especially AKI II, AKI III, severe acute pancreatitis and multiple organ failed systems.

AB  - SUMMARY Commercial publishers have been quick to respond to the opportunities afforded by the National Curriculum. This paper examines some of the new (or in some cases ?updated') primary coursebook schemes, and asks what might be the implications for the primary curriculum, should such schemes be widely adopted in schools. It might be thought that these commercial textbooks simply complete the job begun by the National Curriculum ? i.e. ?technologizing? learning by breaking it down into segments and stages. But we suggest that their function, and hence their construction as texts, is rather more complex. The new schemes embrace a number of different educational ideologies, and appeal to a number of different teacher identities. They speak, for instance, to the ?teacher-as-professionaP and to the ?teacher-in-trouble?. They profess both ?progressive? and ?traditional? values. Rather than indicating unequivocally a tendency to deskill teachers and disempower pupils, as some educationalists would believe, the new textbooks are rather more plural and multi-vocal therefore. Their ultimate impact and import will, of course, become clear only when we discover how the new books are used in teachers? day-to-day practice.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to identify pressure ulcer (PU) incidence and risk factors that are associated with PU development in patients in two adult intensive care units (ICU) in Saudi Arabia. A prospective cohort study design was used. A total of 84 participants were screened second daily basis until discharge or death, over a consecutive 30-day period, out of which 33 participants with new PUs were identified giving a cumulative hospital-acquired PU incidence of 39·3% (33/84 participants). The incidence of medical devices-related PUs was 8·3% (7/84). Age, length of stay in the ICU, history of cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, infrequent repositioning, time of operation, emergency admission, mechanical ventilation and lower Braden Scale scores independently predicted the development of a PU. According to binary logistic regression analyses, age, longer stay in ICU and infrequent repositioning were significant predictors of all stages of PUs, while the length of stay in the ICU and infrequent repositioning were associated with the development of stages II?IV PUs. In conclusion, PU incidence rate was higher than that reported in other international studies. This indicates that urgent attention is required for PU prevention strategies in this setting.
