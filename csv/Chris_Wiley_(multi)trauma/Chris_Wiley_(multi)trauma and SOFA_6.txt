AB  - Abstract Aim Acute kidney injury (AKI) carries an increasing incidence rate worldwide and increases the risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as well as the medical expenses during the post-AKI course. The Taiwan Consortium for Acute Kidney Injury and Renal Diseases (CAKs) has thus launched a nationwide epidemiology and prognosis of dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury (NEP-AKI-D) study, which prospectively enrols critically ill patients with AKI. Through thoroughly evaluating the risk and prognostic factors of AKI, we hope to lower the incidence of AKI and ESRD from the perspective of AKI-ESRD interaction. Methods The CAKs includes 30 hospitals which distribute widely through the four geographical regions (north, middle, south, and east) of Taiwan, and have a 1:1 ratio of medical centres to regional hospitals in each region. The NEP-AKI-D study enrols intensive care unit-based AKI patients who receive dialysis in the four seasonal sampled months (October 2014, along with January, April, and July 2015) in the included hospitals. The collected data include demographic information, pertaining laboratory results, dialysis settings and patient outcomes. The data are uploaded in a centre website and will be audited by on-site principal investigators, computer logic gates, and the CAKs staffs. The outcomes of interest are in-hospital mortality, dialysis-dependency and readmission rate within 90 days after discharge. Conclusion The NEP-AKI-D study enrols a large number of representative AKI patients throughout Taiwan. The results of the current study are expected to provide more insight into the risk and prognostic factors of AKI and further attenuated further chronic kidney disease transition.

AB  - Background Acute abdomen is a time-critical condition, which requires prompt diagnosis, initiation of first-line preoperative therapy and expedient surgical intervention. The earliest opportunity to intervene occurs at presentation to the emergency department triage. The aim of this audit was to evaluate the relationship between emergency triage and time performance measures in the preoperative management of abdominal emergencies. Methods Retrospective audit of time performance measures of key clinical events from emergency triage. Patient characteristics, elapsed time from triage to commencement of fluid resuscitation, intravenous antibiotics and emergency surgery and post-operative outcomes were obtained from review of operative medical records data over a 1-year duration. Results There was variability in triage allocation of patients with acute abdomen requiring urgent surgery. Category 3 was the most commonly assigned triage category (65.6%). The majority of patients (94.8%) had initial clinical assessment within the National Emergency Access Target ?4-hour? rule, and 41.7% seen within 1-h from triage. Despite this, in cases of intra-abdominal sepsis, there was nearly a fourfold elapsed time for first dose intravenous antibiotics, beyond the 1-h recommendation in the Sepsis Kills pathway. There was non-significant trend in faster overall time performances with successive higher triage category allocation. Conclusion This study highlights an opportunity to consider alternative triage methods or fast-track of patients with acute abdomen to promote early surgical assessment, resuscitation, antibiotic therapy and definitive intervention.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews important aspects of children's development that affect their ability to provide useful information when interviewed about events they have experienced. The ability to organize the remembered details into a coherent form is important for both communication and for long-term memory. Infantile amnesia curtails the ability of children and adults alike to recall their earliest experiences verbally, whether or not they were traumatic. The clarity and completeness of children's testimony is clearly affected by their developing communicative abilities. The accuracy of children's accounts is greatly influenced by the linguistic style and the complexity of the language addressed to them by questioners, especially in legal contexts. Children also learn how to participate in conversations. The fact that children may have difficulty recalling specific incidents of multiply-experienced events has led many court systems in the United States to relax the requirement that child witnesses identify the time of the individual incidents of multiply-experienced events.

AB  - Summary Surgical operations involve a great level of complexity. In order to cope with complexity and increase information visibility, modern healthcare facilities are investing in advanced biomedical sensing and information technology. For example, when patients are moved into an intensive care unit after surgical operations, clinicians and nurses will closely monitor a large number of clinical variables such as heart rate, pulse oximetry, blood pressure, gas exchange, and blood test results (e.g., metabolic panel, complete blood count). Heterogeneous sensing gives rise to data-rich environments in hospitals. However, clinicians are not trained and do not have effective decision-support systems to help estimate clinical status and optimize healthcare management policies considering large and heterogeneous data sets (e.g., multiple attributes describing a patient's health conditions). There is a dire need to go beyond current clinical practice and develop data-driven methods and tools that will enable and assist (i) the extraction of pertinent knowledge about clinical status from heterogeneous healthcare recordings, (ii) the prediction of mortality risks, and (iii) the provision of personalized decision-support systems. This present study focuses on the predictive modeling of mortality rates in intensive care units using patient-specific healthcare recordings. Note that variable heterogeneity, patient heterogeneity, and time asynchronization are common characteristics in the postsurgical monitoring. To tackle these challenges, this chapter presents a postsurgical decision-support system that consists of a suite of analytical tools, including data categorization, data preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, and predictive modeling. Experimental results show that the proposed system performs favorably over traditional approaches and yields better results based on the evaluation of real-world data from 4000 subjects. This research shows great potentials for the use of data-driven analytics to improve the quality of postoperative healthcare services.

AB  - Etomidate is an intravenous hypnotic with a favourable clinical profile in haemodynamic high-risk scenarios. Currently, there is an active debate about the clinical significance of the drug's side effects and its overall risk?benefit ratio. Etomidate-induced transient adrenocortical suppression is well documented and has been associated with increased mortality in sepsis. In surgical patients at risk of hypotensive complications, however, a review of current literature provides no robust evidence to contraindicate a single-bolus etomidate induction. Large randomised controlled trials as well as additional observational data are required to compare safety of etomidate and its alternatives.

AB  - Background Nursing procedures that are routinely performed in the intensive care unit (ICU) are assumed to have minimal side effects. However, these procedures may sometimes cause physiological changes that negatively affect the patient. We hypothesized that physiological changes associated with routine nursing procedures in the ICU are common. Methods A clinical observational study of 16 critically ill patients in a nine-bed mixed university hospital ICU. All nursing procedures were observed, and physiological data were collected and subsequently analyzed. Minor physiological changes were defined as minimal changes in respiratory or circulatory variables, and major physiological changes were marked as hyper/hypotension, bradycardia/tachycardia, bradypnea/tachypnea, ventilatory distress, and peripheral blood oxygen desaturation. Results In the 16 patients, 668 procedures generated 158 major and 692 minor physiological changes during 187 observational hours. The most common procedure was patient position change, which also generated the majority of the physiological changes. The most common major physiological changes were blood oxygen desaturation, ventilatory distress, and hypotension, and the most common minor changes were arterial pressure alteration, coughing, and increase in respiratory rate. Conclusion In this pilot study, we examined physiological changes in connection with all regular routine nursing procedures in the ICU. We found that physiological changes were common and sometimes severe.

AB  - Abstract Relative adrenal insufficiency is frequent in patients with severe sepsis and is associated with hemodynamic instability, renal failure, and increased mortality. This study prospectively evaluated the effects of steroids on shock resolution and hospital survival in a series of 25 consecutive patients with cirrhosis and septic shock (group 1). Adrenal function was evaluated by the short corticotropin test within the first 24 hours of admission. Patients with adrenal insufficiency were treated with stress doses of intravenous hydrocortisone (50 mg/6 h). Data were compared to those obtained from the last 50 consecutive patients with cirrhosis and septic shock admitted to the same intensive care unit in whom adrenal function was not investigated and who did not receive treatment with steroids (group 2). Incidence of adrenal insufficiency in group 1 was 68% (17 patients). Adrenal dysfunction was frequent in patients with advanced cirrhosis (Child C: 76% vs. Child B: 25%, P = .08). Resolution of septic shock (96% vs. 58%, P = .001), survival in the intensive care unit (68% vs. 38%, P = .03), and hospital survival (64% vs. 32%, P = .003) were significantly higher in group 1. The main causes of death in group 1 were hepatorenal syndrome or liver failure (7 of 9 patients). In contrast, refractory shock caused most of the deaths in group 2 (20 of 34 patients). In conclusion, relative adrenal insufficiency is very frequent in patients with advanced cirrhosis and septic shock. Hydrocortisone administration in these patients is associated with a high frequency of shock resolution and high survival rate. (HEPATOLOGY 2006;44:1288?1295.)

AB  - Background Little is known about the potential association between socioeconomic status (SES) and prognosis after sepsis. We analysed how SES impacted mortality and readmission in septic patients treated at the intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital. Methods We performed a cohort study including all adult patients admitted to a general tertiary ICU with severe sepsis or septic shock during 2008?2010. Data on SES (educational level, personal income, and cohabitation), comorbidity, readmissions, and mortality were obtained from public registries. We used Cox regression analysis to examine the impact of SES on 30- and 180-day mortality and on first unplanned readmission within 180 days after hospital discharge. Results A total of 387 patients were included of whom 111 (29%) died within 30 days after ICU admission, and 55 (20%) died within 180 days after hospital discharge. Adjusted for sex, comorbidity and SAPS II, patients with low income had a substantially greater risk of dying within 30 days of admission compared to those with high income (35.7% vs. 23.3%; adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.99; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24?3.21), and tended to show higher 180-day mortality (25.0% vs. 15.5%; adjusted HR 1.72; 95% CI 0.86?3.45). Among patients discharged from hospital, 125 (45%) were readmitted within 180 days. Patients with low education and low income showed a tendency towards early readmission. Conclusions Among septic ICU patients, low income was significantly associated with increased 30-day mortality. There was a trend towards earlier readmission among surviving patients with low educational level and personal income.

AB  - Selenium is a component of selenoproteins with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), multiorgan dysfunction (MOD), and multiorgan failure (MOF) are associated with an early reduction in plasma selenium and glutathione peroxidase activity (GPx), and both parameters correlate inversely with the severity of illness and outcomes. Several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluated selenium therapy as monotherapy or in antioxidant cocktails in intensive care unit (ICU) patient populations, and more recently several meta-analyses suggested benefits with selenium therapy in the most seriously ill patients. However, the largest RCT on pharmaconutrition with glutamine and antioxidants, the REducing Deaths due to Oxidative Stress (REDOXS) Study, was unable to find any improvement in clinical outcomes with antioxidants provided by the enteral and parenteral route and suggested harm in patients with renal dysfunction. Subsequently, the MetaPlus study demonstrated increased mortality in medical patients when provided extra glutamine and selenium enterally. The treatment effect of selenium may be dependent on the dose, the route of administration, and whether administered with other nutrients and the patient population studied. Currently, there are few small studies evaluating the pharmacokinetic profile of intravenous (IV) selenium in SIRS, and therefore more data are necessary, particularly in patients with MOD, including those with renal dysfunction. According to current knowledge, high-dose pentahydrate sodium selenite could be given as an IV bolus injection (1000?2000 µg), which causes transient pro-oxidant, cytotoxic, and anti-inflammatory effects, and then followed by a continuous infusion of 1000?1600 µg/d for up to 10?14 days. Nonetheless, the optimum dose and efficacy still remain controversial and need to be definitively established.
