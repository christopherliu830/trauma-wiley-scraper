AB  - ABSTRACT Background Men and women appear to exhibit different susceptibilities to sepsis and possibly divergent outcomes. However, the effect of sex and gender in critical illness outcomes is still controversial and the underlying mechanisms appear to be complex. Objectives We aimed to systematically review and synthesize evidence on the influence of sex on outcomes in critically ill adult patients with sepsis, as reported in published studies specifically including investigation of the effect of sex among their aims. Primary outcome measures include in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) mortality and length of stay (LOS) in the ICU. Search strategy The review was based on focused literature searches (CINAHL, PUBMED, EMBASE and COCHRANE). Methodological quality was assessed through the STROBE checklist and the Cochrane Tool for Bias in Cohort Studies. Meta-analysis was performed using STATA. Published observational studies addressing outcomes of sepsis among their primary aims and having included gender comparisons among primary outcomes in critically ill adult patients were included. Results A total of eight eligible studies were included. With the exception of mortality, it was not possible to perform meta-analysis for other outcomes. Included studies reported data on 25,619 patients with sepsis (14?309 male/11?310 female). There is a paucity of well-designed studies addressing the effect of sex on mortality among patients with sepsis, and absence of studies addressing the effects of sex on multiple organ dysfunction of non-infectious origin. There was significant heterogeneity among study estimates (p?=?0·001; I2=78·1%). Conclusions Although results of data syntheses appear to point towards a small disadvantage for survival among women, our results suggest that data on the impact of sex on sepsis outcomes remain equivocal. Implications for future research include approaches to adjustment for confounders and prospective designs. Relevance to clinical practice Clarifying sex-related differences in sepsis, if any, is crucial for informing evidence-based care.

AB  - Abstract Rationale, aims and objectives? In this article, ideal conceptions about teamwork are tested. The research question posed is: How are teams in psychiatry formed? Three theoretical concepts that distinguish groups from teams are presented: sequentiality, parallelism and synchronicity. The presumption is that groups cooperate sequentially and teams synchronously, while the parallel work mode is a transitional form between group and team. Methods? Three psychiatric outpatient teams at a university hospital specialist clinic were studied. Data were collected through 25 personal interviews and 82 hours of observations. The data collection was carried out over 18 months (2008?2009). Results? Results show: (1) that the three theoretical distinctions between group and team need to be supplemented with two intermediate forms, semiparallel and semisynchronous teamwork; and (2) that teamwork is not characterized by striving towards a synchronous ideal but instead is marked by an adaptive interaction between sequential, parallel and synchronous working modes. Conclusions? The article points to a new intermediate stage between group and team. This intermediate stage is called semiparallel teamwork. The study shows that practical teamwork is not characterized by a synchronous ideal, but rather is about how to adaptively find acceptable solutions to a series of practical problems. The study emphasizes the importance of the team varying between different working modes, so-called semisystematics.

AB  - Aims To investigate the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin in critically ill patients on continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF), a continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and to see if routine measures approximate vancomycin clearance. Methods Pharmacokinetic profiles (15) of initial and steady-state doses of 750?mg twice daily intravenous vancomycin were obtained from blood and ultrafiltrate samples from 10 critically ill patients in the intensive care unit, with acute renal failure on CVVHDF (1?l?h?1 dialysate plus 2?l?h?1 filtration solution; 3?l?h?1 effluent; extracorporeal blood flow 200?ml?min?1). Results CVVHDF clearance of vancomycin was 1.8?±?0.4?l?h?1 (30?±?6.7?ml?min?1). This was 1.3?7.2 times that reported previously for vancomycin using other forms of CRRT. Total vancomycin body clearance was 2.5?±?0.7?l?h?1 (41.7?±?11.7?ml?min?1). The clearance of vancomycin by CVVHDF was 76?±?16.5% of the total body clearance. CVVHDF removed approximately half the vancomycin dose during the 12-h period (ACVVHDF?=?413?mg). The fraction eliminated by all routes was 60%. The sieving coefficient for vancomycin was 0.7?±?0.1 and for urea was 0.8?±?0.06. Conclusions Vancomycin is cleared effectively by CVVHDF. Clearance was faster than other forms of CRRT, therefore doses need to be relatively high. Urea clearance slightly overestimates vancomycin clearance. The administered doses of 750?mg every 12?h were too high and accumulation occurred, as only approximately 60% of a dose was cleared over this period. The maintenance dose required to achieve a target average steady-state plasma concentration of 15?mg?l?1 can be calculated as 450?mg every 12?h.

AB  - Abstract The timing, dose, and route of early nutrition support in critically ill patients have been highly controversial for years. Despite the association of a caloric deficit with adverse outcome, several recent large, randomized, controlled trials have demonstrated a prolongation of organ failure and increased muscle weakness with increasing doses of nutrition in the acute phase of critical illness. A potential explanation for the negative impact of early, full feeding on outcome is feeding-induced suppression of autophagy, a cellular repair process that is necessary to clear intracellular damage. Whether nutrition management in critically ill patients should be guided by its effects on autophagy is a topic of debate. Currently, however, autophagy cannot be monitored in clinical practice. Moreover, clinical management should be guided by high-quality randomized controlled trials, which currently do not support the use of early full nutrition support.

AB  - Summary Ethical issues raised in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) are informed by the traditional principles of patient autonomy, justice, beneficence, non-maleficence, and non-abandonment. Unique features of HCT compound the complexity of these ethical issues, including the fact that most of the diseases are life threatening in the absence of HCT, yet are potentially curable with this treatment, the fact that a living donor is required who is often a minor, the great financial expense of the procedure, and the fact that survivors of HCT may be cured of their primary malignant disease but are at risk for later serious complications. In this chapter, ethical issues in HCT are reviewed under the following general headings: who is eligible for HCT, informed consent for the patient, informed consent for the donor, alternative sources of stem cells, HCT for non-malignant diseases, and end-of-life issues.

AB  - Summary We aimed to compare the reliability of aspiration via a nasogastric tube with ultrasound for assessment of residual gastric volume. Sixty-one adult patients who were mechanically ventilated and received continuous enteral feeding through a nasogastric tube for > 48 h were included. A first qualitative and quantitative ultrasound examination of the gastric antrum was followed by gastric suctioning, performed by an operator blinded to the result of the ultrasound examination. A second ultrasound examination was performed thereafter, followed by re-injection of the aspirated gastric contents (≤ 250 ml) into the stomach. A third ultrasound assessment was then immediately performed. If the suctioned volume was ≥ 250 ml, 250 mg erythromycin was infused over 30 min. A fourth ultrasound was performed 90 min after the third. Sixty (98%) patients had a qualitatively assessed full stomach at first ultrasound examination vs. 52 (85%) after gastric suctioning (p = 0.016). The calculated gastric volume significantly decreased after gastric suctioning, without a significant decrease in the number of patients with volume ≥ 250 ml. Four of the nine patients with calculated gastric volume ≥ 250 ml had vomiting within the last 24 h (p = 0.013). The antral cross-sectional area significantly decreased between the third and the fourth ultrasound examination (p = 0.015). Erythromycin infusion did not make a significant difference to gastric volume (n = 10). Our results demonstrate that gastric suctioning is not a reliable tool for monitoring residual gastric volume. Gastric ultrasound is a feasible and promising tool for gastric volume monitoring in clinical practice.

AB  - Early enteral nutrition (EN) is consistently recommended as first-line nutrition therapy in critically ill patients since it favorably alters outcome, providing both nutrition and nonnutrition benefits. However, critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation are at risk for regurgitation, pulmonary aspiration, and eventually ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). EN may increase these risks when gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction is present. Gastric residual volume (GRV) is considered a surrogate parameter of GI dysfunction during the progression of enteral feeding in the early phase of critical illness and beyond. By monitoring GRV, clinicians may detect patients with delayed gastric emptying earlier and intervene with strategies that minimize or prevent VAP as one of the major risks of EN. The value of periodic GRV measurements with regard to risk reduction of VAP incidence has frequently been questioned in the past years. Increasing the GRV threshold before interrupting gastric feeding results in marginal increases in EN delivery. More recently, a large randomized clinical trial revealed that abandoning GRV monitoring did not negatively affect clinical outcomes (including VAP) in mechanically ventilated patients. The results have revived the discussion on the role of GRV monitoring in critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients receiving early EN. This review summarizes the most recent clinical evidence on the use of GRV monitoring in critically ill patients. Based on the clinical evidence, it discusses the pros and cons and further addresses whether GRV is a dead marker or still alive for the nutrition management of critically ill patients.
