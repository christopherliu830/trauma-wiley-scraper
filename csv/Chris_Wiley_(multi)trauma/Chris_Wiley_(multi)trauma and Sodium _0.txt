AB  - Summary Burns are classified by cause and mechanism, as well as by extent (expressed as percentage of total body surface area or TBSA) and depth. Inhalation injury is caused by inhalation of toxic products of combustion or chemical powders and vapours. Its presence is associated with a worse prognosis for a given extent of cutaneous injury. Timely initiation of appropriate first aid (20 minutes of cool running water for thermal injuries) minimises the extent of tissue damage. Extensive burns constitute major trauma and may be associated with multi-trauma. Patients with major burns require primary and secondary survey, and active resuscitation according to a formula related to size of burn. Burn wounds evolve and require regular review and appropriate dressings. Deep circumferential burns may require escharotomy. Extensive burns are associated with systemic effects, which are a manifestation of a systemic inflammatory response that involves all organs and necessitates provision of critical and multidisciplinary care. Surgical management of extensive burns entails early excision of all necrotic tissue, temporisation of the wound with skin substitutes, and timely grafting according to an established algorithm.

AB  - Background Changes in water balance and the presence of unmeasured anions perturb the inverse relationship between serum chloride (Cl) and bicarbonate (HCO3) concentrations in people, affecting accurate interpretation of acid-base status. Objectives The aim of this study was to demonstrate that corrected serum Cl and predicted HCO3 concentrations, based on serum sodium (Na) concentration and anion gap (AG), would be inversely correlated and could be used to better characterize causes of acid-base disorders in dogs. Methods In this retrospective study, electrolyte data from dogs with at least one abnormality in serum Na, Cl, or HCO3 concentrations were analyzed. Profiles were classified before and after calculations using 2 methods, a modified Feldman and an institutional method, to correct Cl concentration and predict HCO3 concentrations based on Na concentration and AG. Dogs were classified as low (L), normal (N), or high (H) based on Cl (first letter) and HCO3 (second letter) concentrations, as follows: LL, LN, LH, NL, NN, NH, HL, HN, or HH. Results For profiles from 261 dogs, reclassifying corrected Cl and predicted HCO3 concentrations resulted in a shift from the initial classification into a different one in 73% of dogs; in most cases, the shift was to LH, NN, or HL categories. Albumin concentration was a significant factor in acid-base balance. Conclusions When interpreting acid-base status based on results of a standard biochemical panel, erroneous conclusions can be drawn if concentrations of Na, unmeasured anions, and albumin are not taken into account. The inverse relationship between serum Cl and HCO3 concentrations may be used to identify frequent acid-base disorders as well as to unmask abnormalities obscured by irregularities in water balance or AG.

AB  - Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment protocols have been introduced in the intensive care unit (ICU) to avoid secondary brain injury. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the deviations from such a treatment protocol and the frequency of extracranial complications, and relate these findings to outcome. Methods During a 5-year period (2004?2009), 133 patients with severe TBI [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score?≤?8] were prospectively included. The following deviations from treatment goals were studied: intracranial pressure (ICP), blood pressure, haemoglobin, blood glucose, serum sodium, serum albumin, body temperature and extracranial complications during the ICU stay. Outcome was assessed using Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score at 12 months. Results The frequencies of deviations from the treatment goals were: episodes of intracranial hypertension 69.5% (of monitored patients), hypotension 20.3%, anaemia 77.4%, hyperglycaemia 42.9%, hyponatremia 34.6%, hypoalbuminemia 30.8% and hyperthermia 54.9%. Pulmonary complications were common (pneumonia 72.2%, acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury 31.6%). Thrombocytopenia (4.5%), severe sepsis (3.0%), renal failure (0.8%) and liver failure (0.8%) were infrequent. Twenty-six (19.5%) patients died within the first 12 months due to the head injury. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, Injury Severity Score (ISS), ICP?>?25?mmHg, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome. Conclusions Deviations from the TBI treatment protocol were frequent. Pneumonia was the most frequent extracranial complication. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, ISS, high ICP, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome.

AB  - Background In health, the hormones amylin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) slow gastric emptying (GE) and modulate glycaemia. The aims of this study were to determine amylin and GLP-1 concentrations in the critically ill and their relationship with GE, glucose absorption and glycaemia. Methods In fasted critically ill and healthy subjects (n?=?26 and 23 respectively), liquid nutrient, containing 100?mg 13C-sodium octanoate and 3?g 3-O-methlyglucose (3-OMG), was administered via a nasogastric tube. Amylin, GLP-1, glucose and 3-OMG concentrations were measured in blood samples taken during fasting, and 30 min and 60?min after the ?meal?. Breath samples were taken to determine gastric emptying coefficient (GEC). Intolerance to intragastric feeding was defined as a gastric residual volume of ≥?250?ml and/or vomiting within the 24?h prior to the study. Results Although GE was slower (GEC: critically ill 2.8?±?0.9 vs. health, 3.4?±?0.2; P?=?0.002), fasting blood glucose was higher (7.0?±?1.9 vs. 5.7?±?0.2?mmol/l; P?=?0.005) and overall glucose absorption was reduced in critically ill patients (3-OMG: 9.4?±?8.0 vs. 17.7?±?4.9?mmol/l.60?min; P?<?0.001), there were no differences in fasting or postprandial amylin concentrations. Furthermore, although fasting [1.7 (0.4?7.2) vs. 0.7 (0.3?32.0)?pmol/l; P?=?0.04] and postprandial [3.0 (0.4?8.5) vs. 0.8 (0.4?34.3)?pmol/l; P?=?0.02] GLP-1 concentrations were increased in the critically ill and were greater in feed intolerant when compared with those tolerating feed [3.7 (0.4?7.2) vs. 1.2 (0.7?4.6)?pmol/l; P?=?0.02], there were no relationships between GE and fasting amylin or GLP-1 concentrations. Conclusion In the critically ill, fasting GLP-1, but not amylin, concentrations are elevated and associated with feed intolerance. Neither amylin nor GLP-1 appears to substantially influence the rate of GE.

AB  - Summary What is known and Objective:? Literature provides much evidence regarding liposomal amphotericin B treatment for fungal infections in neonates and infants. Relevant data regarding critically ill paediatric patients of older age are scarce. We aimed to present our experience regarding liposomal amphotericin B use in critically ill paediatric patients from a tertiary-care paediatric hospital in Athens, Greece. Methods:? We prospectively identified all paediatric patients who received treatment with liposomal amphotericin B in the intensive care unit of a tertiary-care paediatric hospital during a 3-year period (2005?2008). Data were retrieved from the evaluation of the available medical records. Results and Discussion:? Twenty-three (nine females, mean age: 26·4?months, range: 5?39 months) critically ill paediatric patients were included; 12 had malignancy. In 16 of the 23 included children, liposomal amphotericin B was administered for the treatment of confirmed fungal infections (all but one were invasive), whereas in seven patients, it was used as pre-emptive treatment. One patient received voriconazole concomitantly. Eleven of the 16 children with documented infections were cured; five improved. Six of the seven children who received pre-emptive treatment also showed clinical improvement. Nine deaths were noted, all attributed to underlying diseases. Two cases of hepatotoxicity and one case of nephrotoxicity (all leading to drug-discontinuation) occurred. Seven and five cases of mild reversible hypokalaemia and hyponatraemia, respectively, were also noted. What is new and Conclusion:? According to the findings of our small case series, liposomal amphotericin B may provide a useful treatment option for fungal infections of vulnerable critically ill paediatric patients with considerable comorbidity.

AB  - Abstract Critical illness is an aetiologically and clinically heterogeneous syndrome that is characterised by organ failure and immune dysfunction. Mortality in critically ill patients is driven by inflammation-associated organ damage and a profound vulnerability to nosocomial infection. Both factors are influenced by the activated complement protein C5a, released by unbridled activation of the complement system during critical illness. C5a exerts deleterious effects on organ systems directly and suppresses antimicrobial functions of key immune cells. Whilst several recent reports have added key knowledge of the cellular signalling pathways triggered by C5a, there remain a number of areas that are incompletely understood and therapeutic opportunities are still being evaluated. In this review, we summarise the cellular basis for C5a-induced vulnerability to nosocomial infection and organ dysfunction. We focus on cells of the innate immune system, highlighting the major areas in need of further research and potential avenues for targeted therapies.

AB  - Abstract This study examines the incidence and significance of novel plasma derived platelet aggregating activity (PAA) in 190 consecutive patients admitted to the medical wards of a general hospital. Seventy five patients (39%) demonstrated this activity. The incidence was highest in patients with a history of thrombosis (52%) or in those with a heightened thrombotic tendency, for example, patients with diabetes or hypertension. In contrast, platelet aggregating activity was observed in six out of 62 patients (approximately 10%) in whom a current or past medical history of thrombosis could not be elicited and in only two out of 72 healthy volunteers examined (3%). A high frequency of PAA was also noted in a small group of patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenia and patients who had previously received, platelet transfusions. In these patients, this activity presumably reflects the presence of antiplatelet antibodies. A good correlation between the presence of plasma derived platelet aggregating activity and the phenomenon of spontaneous platelet aggregation was observed. The platelet aggregating activity was not heparin dependent, but was completely abolished by EDTA (5 mM) and benzamidine (8 mM), or by pretreating the platelets with aspirin. A synergistic response was observed with subaggregatory concentrations of thrombin and adrenalin. Our results suggest that the presence of this platelet aggregating activity may provide a marker for vascular thrombosis. Furthermore we postulate that this plasma derived activity may be partly responsible for platelet hyperactivity previously observed in patients with thromboembolic disorders.

AB  - Abstract The aim was to evaluate the effect of HTK compared to UW and Euro?Collins (EC) on the initial graft function and long term graft survival in two prospective randomized studies. Only kidneys from heart-beating, kidney-only or kidney + heart donors were eligible for entry. Initial non-function (INF) was defined as the absence of life-sustaining renal function, requiring dialysis treatment on two or more occasions, during the first week after transplantation. To evaluate the contribution of the preservation solutions on INF in relation to other factors, a multivariate, 2-step logistic regression model was used. Randomization was performed between July 1990 and September 1992. The UW-HTK study comprised 342 donors and 611 transplants (UW: 168 donors and 297 transplants, HTK: 174 donors and 314 transplants). In the EC-HTK study 317 donors and 569 transplants were included (EC: 155 donors and 277 transplants, HTK: 162 donors and 292 transplants). INF occurred in 33 % of either HTK-(n = 105) or UW-(n= 99) preserved kidneys (P = NS), and in 29% of the HTK-(n= 85) and in 43% of the EC-(n= 119) preserved kidneys (P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed no significant influence of the preservation solution on the incidence of INF in the UW-HTK study, but factors contributing to INF were donor age, cause of death, retransplantation, and cold ischemic period. The EC-HTK study showed a significantly higher risk of INF, using EC as preservation, in addition to cold ischemic period and donor quality. The 3-year graft survival of HTK-preserved kidneys was 73 %, compared to 68 % for UW?preserved kidneys in the UW-HTK study (P = NS); while the 3-year graft survival of HTK preserved kidneys was 70 % compared to 67 % for EC-preserved kidneys in the EC-HTK study (P = NS). We can conclude that HTK is comparable to UW in its preservative abilities, using kidneys from heart-beating kidney-only donors, whereas EC as renal preservation solution should be avoided.

This includes temporary abdominal closure and planned reoperation to complete complex, lengthy procedures when the patient is stabilized. Temporary abdominal closure can be achieved safely and cost-effectively by using a presterilized 3-liter cystoscopy fluid IV bag. This article discusses the rationale for temporary abdominal closure and planned reoperation, physiologic considerations in abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), abdominal injuries or conditions leading to ACS, and manifestations of ACS. It compares and contrasts various materials used for temporary abdominal closure, illustrates bag preparation and silo application and removal, and analyzes complex intraoperative and postoperative nursing activities.

AB  - ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious condition, the diagnosis of which currently depends on functional markers such as serum creatinine measurements. Unfortunately, creatinine is a delayed and unreliable indicator of AKI. The lack of early biomarkers of structural kidney injury (akin to troponin in acute myocardial injury) has hampered our ability to translate promising experimental therapies to human AKI. Fortunately, understanding the early stress response of the kidney to acute injuries has revealed a number of potential biomarkers. The discovery, translation and validation of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), possibly the most promising novel AKI biomarker, is reviewed. NGAL is emerging as an excellent stand-alone troponin-like structural biomarker in the plasma and urine for the early diagnosis of AKI, and for the prediction of clinical outcomes such as dialysis requirement and mortality in several common clinical scenarios. The approach of using NGAL as a trigger to initiate and monitor therapies for AKI, and as a safety biomarker when using potentially nephrotoxic agents, is also promising. In addition, it is hoped that the use of sensitive and specific biomarkers such as NGAL as endpoints in clinical trials will result in a reduction in required sample sizes, and hence the cost incurred. Furthermore, predictive biomarkers like NGAL may play a critical role in expediting the drug development process. However, given the complexity of AKI, additional biomarkers (perhaps a panel of plasma and urinary biomarkers) may eventually need to be developed and validated for optimal progress to occur.

AB  - ABSTRACT Reconstruction of joint-crossing digital nerves requires the application of nerve guides with a much higher flexibility than used for peripheral nerve repair along larger bones. Nevertheless, collapse-resistance should be preserved to avoid secondary damage to the regrowing nerve tissue. In recent years, we presented chitosan nerve guides (CNGs) to be highly supportive for the regeneration of critical gap length peripheral nerve defects in the rat. Now, we evidently increased the bendability of regular CNGs (regCNGs) by developing a wavy wall structure, that is, corrugated CNGs (corrCNGs). In a comprehensive in vivo study, we compared both types of CNGs with clinical gold standard autologous nerve grafts (ANGs) and muscle-in-vein grafts (MVGs) that have recently been highlighted in the literature as a suitable alternative to ANGs. We reconstructed rat sciatic nerves over a critical gap length of 15 mm either immediately upon transection or after a delay period of 45 days. Electrodiagnostic measurements were applied to monitor functional motor recovery at 60, 90, 120, and 150 (only delayed repair) days postreconstruction. Upon explanation, tube properties were analyzed. Furthermore, distal nerve ends were evaluated using histomorphometry, while connective tissue specimens were subjected to immunohistological stainings. After 120 days (acute repair) or 150 days (delayed repair), respectively, compression?stability of regCNGs was slightly increased while it remained stable in corrCNGs. In both substudies, regCNGs and corrCNGs supported functional recovery of distal plantar muscles in a similar way and to a greater extent when compared with MVGs, while ANGs demonstrated the best support of regeneration.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability and is a risk factor for the later development of neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Many models of TBI have been developed, but their further refinement and a more detailed long-term follow-up is needed. We have used the Thy1-YFP-H transgenic mouse line and the parallel rod floor test to produce an unbiased and robust method for the evaluation of the multiple effects of a validated model of controlled cortical injury. This approach reveals short- and long-term progressive changes, including compromised biphasic motor function up to 85 days post-lesion, which correlates with neuronal atrophy, dendrite and spine loss, and long-term axonal pathology evidenced by axon spheroids and fragmentation. Here we present methods for inducing a controlled cortical injury in the Thy1-YFP-H transgenic mouse line and for evaluating the resulting deficits in the parallel rod floor test. This technique constitutes a new, unbiased, and robust method for the evaluation of motor and behavioral alterations after TBI. ? 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
