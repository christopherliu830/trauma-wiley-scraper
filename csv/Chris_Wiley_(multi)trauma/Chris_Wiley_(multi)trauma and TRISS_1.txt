AB  - Purpose? TRD is an uncommon but serious consequence of blunt trauma. It is often associated with other life threatening injuries and its diagnosis is challenging. Limited information exists on outcomes following rupture, although there are increasing reports of late recurrent herniation. Our aim was to document the outcome of TRD initially and at intermediate term follow up (up to five years). Methodology? A review of all patients suffering TRD, over the past five years, at The Alfred Hospital was performed. Injury severity score (ISS), associated injuries, diagnosis- early versus late and imaging modality used, and surgical repair technique were recorded. All patients were followed up with a questionnaire, regarding symptoms of recurrence and chest X-ray (CXR). Results? 33 patients (18 female, 15 male; mean age 36?yrs, mean ISS 42) were included. All injury mechanisms were high energy (motor vehicle occupants 27, pedestrians 5, horse rider 1); 25 sustained other intra-abdominal injuries. There were nine early and no late deaths. CXR was diagnostic in 14 cases, with 23 recognised early (pre-operatively). 6 were diagnosed intra-operatively (5 for instability, 1 following unremarkable imaging). 3 late diagnoses (>24 hours after presentation) occurred, with 1 at 6 months post injury. Emergent primary repair was undertaken using non-absorbable sutures, although in three cases absorbable sutures were used. Conclusions? TRD is associated with high energy blunt force and severe multi-system injury. We advocate emergent primary repair with non-absorbable suture and advise a minimum five year follow-up.

AB  - Purpose? Traumatic diaphragmatic herniae are an uncommon sequelae of abdominal trauma which present a significant diagnostic challenge, especially when unaccompanied by other intraabdominal injuries necessitating exploratory laparotomy. Laparoscopic repair is a relatively new and uncommon procedure, with the literature consisting almost entirely of isolated case reports and small case series. We present one of our own cases, and perform a quantitative analysis of the combined literature experience to date. Methodology? Cases reports of laparoscopic repair of traumatic diaphragmatic herniae were identified by a Medline literature search. Clinical findings, technical decisions and outcomes were correlated via database. Results? Data from 50 cases was available. There was no common standard method of repair although the majority (31/50) were accomplished without the use of mesh. The major complication rate was 4%, the overall complication rate was 16%. Defects greater than 10cm long were associated with a 41% rate of open conversion, versus 0% if less than 10cm. There were no recurrences described. Conclusion? Laparoscopic repair of traumatic diaphragmatic herniae enjoys a low rate of major complications, whilst avoiding the morbidity of open repair. Several technical points remain open to operator preference, and we invite discussion regarding the merits of each.

AB  - Aim Blunt injuries to visceral organs have the potential to lead to delayed pseudoaneurysm formation or organ rupture, but current trauma and surgical guidelines do not recommend repetitive imaging. This study examined the incidence and timing of delayed undesirable events and established advisable timing for follow-up imaging and appropriate observational admission. Methods Patients with blunt splenic (S), liver (L), or kidney (K) injury treated with non-operative management (NOM) in our institution were included and retrospectively reviewed. Results From January 2013 to January 2017, 57 patients were admitted with documented blunt visceral organ injuries and 22 patients were excluded. Of 35 patients (L, 10; S, 17; K, 6; L  S  S, 9; K, 1) patients underwent transcatheter arterial embolization. Delayed undesirable events occurred in four patients: three patients with splenic pseudoaneurysm on hospital day 6?7 and one patient with splenic delayed rupture on hospital day 7. The second follow-up computed tomography scan carried out 1?2 days after admission did not show any significant findings that could help predict undesirable results of delayed events. The patients with delayed events had longer continuous abdominal pain than that of event-free patients (P = 0.04). Conclusions Undesirable delayed events were recognized on follow-up computed tomography scans in 11.4% of NOM patients at hospital day 6?7 and tended to be associated with high-grade splenic injuries and continuous symptoms. Repetitive screening of these patients 6?7 days after injury might be warranted because of the potential risk of delayed events.

AB  - Abstract Background: Non-operative management (NOM) of blunt splenic injuries is nowadays considered the standard treatment. The present study identified selection criteria for primary operative management (OM) and planned NOM. Methods: All adult patients with blunt splenic injuries treated at Berne University Hospital, Switzerland, between 2000 and 2008 were reviewed. Results: There were 206 patients (146 men) with a mean(s.d.) age of 38·2(19·1) years and an Injury Severity Score of 30·9(11·6). The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma classification of the splenic injury was grade 1 in 43 patients (20·9 per cent), grade 2 in 52 (25·2 per cent), grade 3 in 60 (29·1 per cent), grade 4 in 42 (20·4 per cent) and grade 5 in nine (4·4 per cent). Forty-seven patients (22·8 per cent) required immediate surgery. Transfusion of at least 5 units of red cells (odds ratio (OR) 13·72, 95 per cent confidence interval 5·08 to 37·01), Glasgow Coma Scale score below 11 (OR 9·88, 1·77 to 55·16) and age 55 years or more (OR 3·29, 1·07 to 10·08) were associated with primary OM. The rate of primary OM decreased from 33·3 to 11·9 per cent after the introduction of transcatheter arterial embolization in 2005. Overall, 159 patients (77·2 per cent) qualified for NOM, which was successful in 143 (89·9 per cent). The splenic salvage rate was 69·4 per cent. In multivariable analysis age at least 40 years was the only factor independently related to failure of NOM (OR 13·58, 2·76 to 66·71). Conclusion: NOM of blunt splenic injuries has a low failure rate. Advanced age is independently associated with an increased failure rate. Copyright ? 2010 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd.

AB  - Purpose? The comprehensive describtion of the epidemiology of pelvic ring fractures (PRF) including high-energy PRF, low-energy PRF and those who die during the prehospital phase (pre-H). Methods? 12-month prospective population based study was performed in a trauma system with one Level-1 trauma centre and seven referring hospitals (population: 0.6 million). Data were collected on all PRF from the trauma system including high-energy, low energy fractures and pre-H deaths with PRF. Patient demographics, injury severity score (ISS), mortality (%) and PRF-related mortality were recorded prospectively. All high-energy deaths had autopsy at the same forensic pathology department. Data presented as percentages (%) or mean +/? SEM. Results? During the 12-month period 138 patients suffered PRF (45% male, 59+/?2 years, ISS 20+/?2, 21% mortality and 8% PRF-related mortality). Sixty-four % of the low-energy and 92% of the high-energy patients were transferred directly to the trauma center. There were 57 high-energy (71% male, 41+/?3 years, ISS 23+/?3, 14% mortality, 7% PRF-related mortality) 63 low-energy (20% male, 81+/?1 years, ISS 6+/?1, 5% mortality, 2% PRF-related mortality) and 18 pre-H died patients with PRF (47% male, 41+/?6 years, ISS 61+/?4, 100% mortality, 33% PRF-related mortality). PRF-related mortality was always due to bleeding. Conclusions? The majority of PRF-related mortality occurs pre-H. Half of the multiple-injured high-energy PRF patients still die because of the pelvic bleeding. Further preventive measures and optimization of the care of PRF patients is required. Trauma centre admission of 2/3 of the low-energy PRF is a significant load and should be further investigated in an inclusive trauma system.

AB  - Aim The increased prevalence of non-operative management of splenic injuries contributes to the infrequent use of salvage procedures. Nevertheless, salvage procedures are sometimes required. The study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of our salvage procedure protocol for selected patients. Methods This retrospective study included 27 splenic injury patients divided into two groups: those treated by salvage procedures (splenorrhaphy or partial resection) and those who underwent splenectomy. Our salvage procedure protocol was applied in the following situations: if hemodynamics were stable during laparotomy or bleeding was fully controlled by manual or incisional mobilization of the organ, when no more than two other organs required repair, and if no clinical coagulopathy existed. Results The splenic abbreviated injury scale, intraoperative bleeding, and transfusion requirements of packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma requirements in 24?h were significantly lower in the salvage procedure group. There was no difference in the injury severity score, initial amount of bleeding, length of intensive care unit stay, or morbidity and mortality rates between the groups. Patients who underwent salvage procedures were managed without major complication, except one pseudoaneurysm case. Conclusion We confirmed the feasibility of our salvage procedure protocol for selected patients, particularly for those with simple or lower grade injuries.

AB  - Background? The epidemiology of post-injury multiple organ failure (MOF) is reported to go through changes during the last 15 years. The purpose of this study is to describe the epidemiology of post-injury MOF in Australia. Methods? A 12-month prospective epidemiological study was performed in a Major Trauma Service. Demographics, injury severity (ISS), physiological, MOF status and outcome data was prospectively collected on all trauma patients who met inclusion criteria (ICU admission; ISS?>?15; age?>?18, AIS head <3 and survival >48?hrs). MOF was defined by the Denver MOF score. Data are presented as % or Mean+/?SEM. Univariate statistical comparison was performed (Student t- and X-square tests), p?<?0.05 was considered significant. Results? Twenty-five patients met inclusion criteria (Age 39+/?5, ISS 27+/?3, Male 60%), three patients (12%) developed MOF. The maximum MOF score was 5.7 +/?1, with duration of 2.3+/?0.7 days. Two patients had respiratory and cardiac failure, while one patient had failure of respiratory, cardiac, hepatic and renal systems. All MOF patients survived. MOF patients tend to have longer ICU stays (18+/?5.5 vs 7+/?0.8 p?=?0.17), were older (54+/?17 vs 38+/?5 p?=?0.4). None of the previously described independent predictors (ISS, base deficit, lactate, transfusions) were different when the MOF patients were compared with the non-MOF patients. Conclusion? MOF is not as significant a cause of late trauma death as previously reported internationally. Our preliminary data challenges the timeliness of the 10-year-old independent predictors of post-injury MOF. The epidemiology, the clinical presentation and the independent predictors of post-injury MOF requires reassessment for the Australian context.

AB  - Haemorrhage remains a major cause of potentially preventable deaths. Trauma and massive transfusion are associated with coagulopathy secondary to tissue injury, hypoperfusion, dilution and consumption of clotting factors and platelets. Concepts of damage control surgery have evolved, prioritizing the early control of the cause of bleeding by non-definitive means, while haemostatic control resuscitation seeks early control of coagulopathy. Haemostatic resuscitation provides transfusions with plasma and platelets in addition to red blood cells (RBCs) in an immediate and sustained manner as part of the transfusion protocol for massively bleeding patients. Transfusion of RBCs, plasma and platelets in a similar proportion as in whole blood prevents both hypovolaemia and coagulopathy. Although an early and effective reversal of coagulopathy is documented, the most effective means of preventing coagulopathy of massive transfusion remains debated and randomized controlled studies are lacking. Results from recent before-and-after studies in massively bleeding patients indicate that trauma exsanguination protocols involving the early administration of plasma and platelets are associated with improved survival. Furthermore, viscoelastic whole blood assays, such as thrombelastography (TEG)/rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM), appear advantageous for identifying coagulopathy in patients with severe haemorrhage, as opposed to conventional coagulation assays. In our view, patients with uncontrolled bleeding, regardless of its cause, should be treated with goal-directed haemostatic control resuscitation involving the early administration of plasma and platelets and based on the results of the TEG/ROTEM analysis. The aim of the goal-directed therapy should be to maintain a normal haemostatic competence until surgical haemostasis is achieved, as this appears to be associated with reduced mortality.

AB  - Summary A consistent message within critical care publications has been that a restrictive transfusion strategy is non-inferior, and possibly superior, to a liberal strategy for stable, non-bleeding critically ill patients. Translation into clinical practice has, however, been slow. Here, we describe the degree of adherence to UK best practice guidelines in a regional network of nine intensive care units within Wessex. All transfusions given during a 2-month period were included (n = 444). Those given for active bleeding or within 24 h of major surgery, trauma or gastrointestinal bleeding were excluded (n = 148). The median (IQR [range]) haemoglobin concentration before transfusion was 73 (68?77 [53?106]) g.l?1, with only 34% of transfusion episodes using a transfusion threshold of < 70 g.l?1. In a subgroup analysis that did not study patients with a history of cardiac disease (n = 42), haemoglobin concentration before transfusion was 72 (68?77 [50?98]) g.l?1, with only 36% of transfusion episodes using a threshold of < 70 g.l?1 (see Fig. 3). Most blood transfusions given to critically ill patients who were not bleeding in this audit used a haemoglobin threshold > 70 g.l?1. The reason why recommendations on transfusion triggers have not translated into clinical practice is unclear. With a clear national drive to decrease usage of blood products and clear evidence that a threshold of 70 g.l?1 is non-inferior, it is surprising that a scarce and potentially dangerous resource is still being overused within critical care. Simple solutions such as electronic patient records that force pause for thought before blood transfusion, or prescriptions that only allow administration of a single unit in non-emergency circumstances may help to reduce the incidence of unnecessary blood transfusions.

AB  - Purpose? Prospective validation of recently established independent predictors for postinjury abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) was performed. Methodology? All trauma patients who met inclusion criteria (ICU admission, ISS?>?15, Base Deficit (BD)?>?5, or resuscitation with >5?L crystalloids) were prospectively monitored. Patients with isolated head injuries were excluded. Demographics, ISS, resuscitation fluids, physiological parameters, intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and the independent predictors in two time windows ?ED discharge?[SBP, crystalloids, Time-to OR, transfusions] and ?ICU admission?[crystalloids, urine output (UO), Hb, Temperature, BD] were collected. Data are presented as mean ?±? SEM, p?<?0.05 considered significant. Results? Twenty-two blunt trauma patients were monitored (Age 39?±?5 years, 77% males, ISS 32?±?2, SBP 107?±?5 mmHg, BD 7?±?1). No patients developed ACS. Seven patients developed IAH (IAP?>?20?mmHg). IAH and non-IAH patients had the same age (41?±?7 vs 37?±?5?yrs) and admission BD (7.5?±?1.3 vs 6.3?±?1.2). IAH patients had higher ISS than non-IAH patients (39?±?3 vs 30?±?2). Outcomes (IAH vs non-IAH): ICU LOS (39?±?3 vs 30?±?2), Mortality (0% vs 7%), MOF (29% vs 0%). ?ED-discharge predictors?: The IAH and non-IAH patients had similar admission SBP, ED crystalloid volume, transfusions and ED time. ?ICU-admission predictors?: IAH and non-IAH patients had similar UO, crystalloid infusions, BD, temperature but the IAH group had lower Hb (99?±?5 vs 111?±?3?g/dl) than the non-IAH patients. Conclusions? The incidence of ACS decreased from 14% to 0% in a comparable population. The predictors for ACS did not predict IAH. After the elimination of the lethal ACS, the clinical importance of postinjury IAH has to be defined.

AB  - Purpose? This study aimed to evaluate the pattern of solid intra-abdominal organ injuries in Central Australia, with focus on the mechanism of injury, Injury Severity Score (ISS), distribution of injury, role of surgical intervention and their outcome. It aimed to assess if difference exists in the above perimeters between the indigenous and non-indigenous population. Methodology? This is a retrospective analysis of a selected group of patients as identified by ICD Codes. Database has been created for patients admitted with renal, pancreatic, hepatic and splenic trauma over a five-year period (2001?2005). Data on demographics, mechanism of injury, distribution of injury, length of stay and ISS has been collected. Results? Seventy-one patients has been identified, with 51 (72%) indigenous and 20 (28%) non-indigenous. 29 patients (41%) were involved in a Motor Vehicle Accident and 33 (46%) were assaulted. There is no statistical difference with the distribution of injury and ISS amongst indigenous and non-indigenous populations. However there appears to have a higher incidence of surgical intervention associated with the indigenous group (28.8% versus 12.5%). This may be explained by the compliance rate as 29.4% of indigenous patients left against medical advice as compared with 0% with the non-indigenous group. Conclusion? The mechanism, pattern and severity of injury appear to be comparable amongst the indigenous and non-indigenous population in Central Australia. However there is a difference in their incidence of surgical intervention. ISS may not be as useful in prediction for need for intervention in this group and a different approach to trauma management may need to be tailored to this population.

Simple rules need to be considered when defining the care strategy for these patients. Simple rules: ?? Establish at pre-hospital care and delivery system ?? Recognize the ?at risk? patient or injury pattern ?? Rule out and/or account for other major sources of bleeding ?? Control other sources of bleeding, if possible ?? Resuscitate to a ?tolerable? blood pressure ?? Blood product replacement: RBCs, platelets and FFP ?? Provisionally stabilize the pelvis ?? pelvic binder or sheet ?? ipsilateral femoral traction, in some cases ?? Emergent external fixation? ?? Stop arterial bleeding ?? Angiography and selective embolization ?? Exploration and direct pelvic gutter packing ?? Don?t be fooled by a positive FAST from an extra-peritoneal bladder rupture ?? an ex-lap for a retroperitoneal bleed can be fatal ?? To the TICU for continued resuscitation ??

AB  - This paper reviews the management of head injuries arising in the rural and remote areas of Queensland. Methodology? Data was obtained from the Queensland Trauma Registry from January 2003 to December 2004, a total of 3,088 patients, 1667 classified as major injury. Queensland is the second largest state in Australia with most of the 4 million population living along the eastern seaboard, mainly in the southeast corner and a widely dispersed rural population in small towns. There are neurosurgical services in Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Townsville. Results? Forty percent of patients are referred from another hospital for definitive care with transfer times of up to 10 hours between the referring and definitive care hospital. Of those requiring craniotomy 60% of patients are referred from a another hospital again with lengthy transfer times well beyond the 2 hour transfer time for the deteriorating head injury with intracranial haemorrhage as recommended in the NSA/RACS set of guidelines for the ?Management of Acute Neurotrauma in Rural and Remote Locations?. This paper reviews the problems which include deficient retrieval resources, a reluctance by non-neurosurgeons to perform emergency neurosurgery, a lack of training amongst younger surgeons, and perceived medicolegal issues. The paper also compares the situation in other states and territories. Conclusions? Recommendations are made to improve the delivery of neurotrama care.

AB  - Intercostal catheter placement is common practice in the management of haemothorax and pneumothorax, with over 12,000 being inserted per year (1) in Australian hospitals. It is however an invasive procedure with the potential for significant iatrogenic injury. This is even more pertinent in the trauma setting where stress levels are high and time may be limited. Historically, complications that have been associated with intercostal catheter placement include: lung parenchymal laceration, bleeding from intercostal vessel injury, cardiac injury, ectopic tube placement, empyema, diaphragmatic and intra-abdominal organ laceration. In an attempt to minimise and avoid these complications, there has been a shift in the teaching of the method of tube placement from that of a trocar technique to the blunt dissection (EMST) approach (2). While this will hopefully reduce the rate of procedural complications, it still may not guarantee clinical practice free of complications. Furthermore when these complications are suspected, there is a need for repeated clinical assessment (at times, independent of imaging) in order to allow the early identification any such iatrogenic injury. The presentation will provide a review of the literature and outline the various forms of iatrogenic injury associated with tube thoracostomy; highlight the importance of clinical reassessment following intercostal catheter placement, with particular reference to a case presentation; and discuss techniques to avoid and minimise potential complications.

AB  - In civilian trauma concerns about tourniquet-related problems has rendered tourniquets virtually obselete. The use of tourniquets in a battlefield setting however remains surrounded by controversy. Whilst many accept that if properly used, tourniquets can be life saving devices, opinion is divided regarding its role. Some surgeons have recommended abolition of the tourniquet, whist others advocate that every combat solder should be issued with a tourniquet as part of their personal equipment. The recent introduction of the self applied C-A-T tourniquet into the Australian Defence Force has re-ignited controversy as to the appropriate role of tourniquets in an operational setting. During Vietnam, Desert Storm and Somalia haemorrhage from extremity wounds was a leading cause of preventable combat deaths. Improvements in body armour and increased exposure to blast injury has resulted in a relative increase in limb injuries in recent operations. Experience in Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan particularly by Special Operations communities has led to a re-assessment of the efficacy of battlefield tourniquet systems. The C-A-T tourniquet has been widely used in Iraq and Afghanistan. No iatrogenic injury has been reported, even with tourniquet times up to 8 hours. This paper will discuss the history of tourniquet use in the military from its first introduction in 1674 to the most recent ADF doctrine (ADFP XXX). It will also present trial results from the UK and US and recommendations from the 2006 Advanced Technologies Applied to Combat Casualty Care Conference (ATACC). This paper will address the basis of current doctrine and provide a case for and against the use of tourniquets in an operational setting.
