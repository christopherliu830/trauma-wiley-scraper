AB  - The single vehicle rollover accident is a highly complex crash mode and there is growing concerns about its incidents and consequences in central Australia. The aim of this paper is to assess: 1 The incidence and injury patterns of rollover accidents 2 Pre rollover characteristics on rollover propensity 3 The injury severity and outcome of rollover accidents The absence of speed limit, unfenced roads, vast distances traveled, unsealed roads and high use of alcohol makes the spectrum of MVA? s in NT unique. In this two year period of study from Jan 2004 ? Dec 2005, there were 470 motor vehicle accidents of which 126 were single vehicle rollover accidents. 132 patients were admitted; 73 NT residents of which 45 were of aboriginal origin and 14 were international tourists. There were 37 deaths in Central Australian roads and 20 were due to single vehicle rollover accidents. None of the deaths occurred at the Alice Springs hospital . Most rollover accidents occur at a speed above 100?km/h. 24 patients had an ISS?>?15 and 35% of all injuries were to head, neck and shoulder. Rollovers occurred when the vehicle left the road way and encountered a tripping mechanism such as soft dirt or loose gravel. Those who were belted fared better than those unbelted occupants. Completely ejected occupants were all unbelted. Mean time to hospital from time of accident was 8Hrs. Primary prevention strategies need to involve remote communities, tourists traveling in central Australia and address alcohol and restraint use.

AB  - Summary Twentieth century transfusion medicine was advanced by the leadership of many physicians, scientists and technologists and repeatedly incorporated new diagnostics and new therapeutics to improve patient care. Each year, approximately 100 million blood donations are made worldwide. A safe and adequate blood supply is now an essential infrastructure requirement of any modern national healthcare system. During the final two decades of the twentieth century, intense focus on screening blood donations for infectious diseases led to substantial progress in blood safety and a significant reduction in the risk of transfusion-transmitted diseases. With the advent of the twenty-first century, the landscape of transfusion risk shifted its emphasis towards non-infectious hazards. Cellular therapy is a major growth area in transfusion medicine. The ability to mobilise haematopoietic progenitor cells, then harvest them safely in bulk numbers, process, freeze and successfully reinfuse them as a stem cell tissue transplant has completely revolutionised the field of bone marrow transplantation.

AB  - Abstract Database tomography is a technique for identifying pervasive themes in large text databases and revealing the connectivity among these themes by using a computer-based algorithm to extract and order data. This allows users to create a taxonomy of pervasive research ?thrusts? and interrelationships from the extracted data. The author examines how database tomography can be used to derive technical intelligence for professional literature in a given technical field. For this study, the field of Research Impact Assessment was selected. A database of relevant RIA articles was generated and the database ?mapped? to reveal the relationships among the main ?thrust? 3T63S. ? 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
