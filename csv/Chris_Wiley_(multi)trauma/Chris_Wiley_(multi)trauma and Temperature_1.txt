AB  - Abstract In poly-traumatic patients a blunt chest trauma is an important trigger of the posttraumatic systemic inflammatory response. There is clinical evidence that fracture healing is delayed in such patients, however, experimental data are lacking. Therefore, we investigated the influence of a thoracic trauma on fracture healing in a rat model. Male Wistar rats received either a blunt chest trauma combined with a femur osteotomy or an isolated osteotomy. A more rigid or a more flexible external fixator was used for fracture stabilization to analyze whether the thoracic trauma influences regular healing and mechanically induced delayed bone healing differently. The blunt chest trauma induced a significant increase of IL-6 serum levels after 6 and 24?h, suggesting the induction of a systemic inflammation, whereas the isolated fracture had no effect. Under a more rigid fixation the thoracic trauma considerably impaired fracture healing after 35 days, reflected by a significantly reduced flexural rigidity (three-point-bending test), as well as a significantly diminished callus volume, moment of inertia, and relative bone surface (µCT analysis). In confirming the clinical evidence, this study reports for the first time that a blunt chest trauma considerably impaired bone healing, possibly via the interaction of the induced systemic inflammation with local inflammatory processes. ? 2010 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Blast-induced traumatic brain injury is on the rise, predominantly as a result of the use of improvised explosive devices, resulting in undesirable neuropsychological dysfunctions, as demonstrated in both animals and humans. This study investigated the effect of open-field blast injury on the rat brain using multi-echo, susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). Multi-echo SWI provided phase maps with better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), making it a sensitive technique for brain injury. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a survivable blast of 180 kPa. The visibility of blood vessels of varying sizes improved with multi-echo SWI. Reduced signal intensity from major vessels post-blast indicates increased deoxyhaemoglobin. Relative cerebral blood flow was computed from filtered phase SWI images using inferred changes in oxygen saturation from major blood vessels. Cerebral blood flow decreased significantly at day 3 and day 5 post-blast compared with that pre-blast. This was substantiated by the upregulation of ?-amyloid precursor protein (?-APP), a marker of ischaemia, in the neuronal perikaya of the cerebral cortex, as observed by immunofluorescence, and in the cortical tissue by western blot analysis. Our findings indicate the presence of brain ischaemia in post-blast acute phase of injury with possible recovery subsequently. Our results from cerebrovascular imaging, histology and staining provide an insight into the ischaemic state of the brain post-blast and may be useful for prognosis and outcome.

AB  - SUMMARY HLA-DR expression on monocytes as marker for monocytic function is severely depressed after major trauma. The membrane enzyme aminopeptidase N/CD13 can trigger help in antigen processing by MHC class II molecules of antigen-presenting cells. We determined the simultaneous expression of HLA-DR and CD13 on peripheral blood monocytes of patients with major trauma (injury severity score of ≥16). 1?: 1 conjugates of phycoerythrin (PE)-to-monoclonal antibody were used in combination with QuantiBRITETM PE beads for a standardized quantification in terms of antibodies bound per cell (ABC). The very low expression of HLA-DR antigen on monocytes of patients at day 1 after major trauma confirmed previous results in the literature. Monocytic HLA-DR expression increased slowly to reach values in the lower range of healthy volunteers at day 14. Monocytic CD13 expression at day 1 showed values in the range of healthy volunteers, and a strong rise afterwards. Fourteen days after trauma, the monocytic expression of CD13 was still much higher than in the control group. Because lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 have been shown to be involved in the depressed HLA-DR expression on monocytes in trauma patients, we studied the in vitro effects of LPS and interleukin (IL)-10 on the expression of CD13 on monocytes prepared from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers. Whereas a 3-day IL-10 treatment resulted in a down-regulation of both HLA-DR and CD13 expression on monocytes, LPS caused a down-regulation of HLA-DR but a rapid up-regulation of CD13 levels. Therefore we suggest that, with respect to monocytic CD13 expression, LPS rather than IL-10 could well be the explanation for monocytic surface molecules after severe injury, although other mediators with a CD13 regulating function have to be considered.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The effectiveness of massive transfusion protocols (MTPs) has been assumed from low quality studies with multiple biases. This review aimed to (i) evaluate the association between the institution of an MTP and mortality and (ii) determine the effect of MTPs on transfusion practice post trauma. Methods A systematic review of studies that examined patient outcomes before and after the institution of an MTP in the same centre was conducted. The design and results of each study were described. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q test and the I2 statistic. Odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes from each study were pooled. Results There were eight studies that satisfied inclusion criteria with marked heterogeneity in study populations (I2 = 72.1%, P = 0.001). Two studies showed significantly improved mortality following implementation of an MTP, and six studies showed no significant change. Pooled OR for the effect of an MTP on short-term mortality was 0.73 (95% confidence interval: 0.48?1.11). The effect of MTPs on transfusion practice was varied. Conclusion Despite the popularity of MTPs and directives mandating their use in trauma centres, in before?after studies, MTPs have not always been associated with improved mortality. Evidence-based standardization of MTPs, improved compliance and analysis of broader endpoints were identified as areas for further research.

AB  - SUMMARY Severe trauma can lead to a compromised immune response, thereby increasing susceptibility to infections. Here we will study to what extent these early changes in the immune status upon trauma affect a primary immune response to keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). Because glutamine is the preferred respiratory substrate for immune competent cells and known to be depleted after trauma, we studied the immune status and the primary sensitization in relation to the glutamine plasma concentration in a group of severe trauma patients [injury severity score (ISS) >17]. Trauma patients (n?=?31) were sensitized with KLH within 12 h after trauma; plasma glutamine concentrations and immune parameters were determined, after which KLH-specific immune responsiveness was evaluated on days 9 and 14. Low plasma glutamine concentrations were found after trauma. Significantly elevated numbers of granulocytes and CD14-positive leucocytes were found, whereas the HLA-DR expression on CD14-positive cells was significantly lower in trauma patients than in healthy controls. Trauma did not change the in vitro proliferative capacity of lymphocytes when cultured with glutamine; however, when lymphocytes were cultured without glutamine, trauma resulted in lower proliferation than healthy controls. Phytohaemagglutinin-(PHA)-induced interferon (IFN)-? and interleukin (IL)-10 production was significantly lower after trauma, whereas IL-4 production was not affected. KLH sensitization following trauma resulted in poor skin test reactivity and low in vitro KLH-induced lymphocyte proliferation compared to controls. In contrast, the development of anti-KLH IgM, IgG, IgA, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 production on days 9 and 14 following trauma was not different from that in healthy controls. Major trauma was associated with a reduced cell-mediated immune response, correlating with low plasma glutamine concentrations, while no effects of trauma were found on the development of a primary humoral immune response.

AB  - Summary Teeth have two regions where trauma can cause irreparable damage: the dental pulp and periodontium. The classification of the injury type, and signs and symptoms may not fully indicate the true extent of the injury, which may be multi-factorial. Exposure or near exposure of the pulp in the mouth and damage to the neurovascular bundle can result in one of several different outcomes for the dental pulp. The rate of pulp necrosis with a number of different injuries varies with age and the stage of tooth development. Endodontic treatment would only be commenced if there were signs and symptoms of an endodontic infection. A thorough history and examination are necessary to not only reveal the full extent of injuries to the teeth and jaws, but also to exclude more serious injuries, such as concussion and neck injuries, which may need urgent medical care.

AB  - Background: Since 1992 the Consultative Committee on Road Traffic Fatalities in Victoria has identified deficiencies and errors in the management of 559 road traffic fatalities in which the patients were alive on arrival of ambulance services. The Committee also assessed the preventability of deaths. Reproducibility of results using its methodology has been shown to be statistically significant. The Committee?s findings and recommendations, the latter made in association with the learned Colleges and specialist Societies, led to the establishment of a Ministerial Taskforce on Trauma and Emergency Services. As a consequence, in 2000, a new trauma care system will be implemented in Victoria. This paper presents a case example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology. Methods: The Committee has two 12 member multidisciplinary evaluative panels. A retrospective evaluation was made of the complete ambulance, hospital and autopsy records of eligible fatalities. The clinical and pathological findings were analysed using a comprehensive data proforma, a narrative summary and the complete records. Resulting multidisciplinary discussion problems were identified and the potential preventability of death was assessed. Results: In the present case example the Committee identified 16 management deficiencies of which 11 were assessed as having contributed to the patient?s death; the death, however, was judged to be non-preventable. Conclusion: The presentation of this example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology may be of assistance to hospital medical staff undertaking their own major trauma audit.

AB  - Abstract Background Traumatic injury can lead to dysregulation of the normal clotting system, resulting in hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications. Platelet activation is robust following traumatic injury and one process of platelet activation is to release of extracellular vesicles (PEV) that carry heterogenous cargo loads and surface ligands. Objectives We sought to investigate and characterize the release and function of PEVs generated following traumatic injury. Methods PEV content and quantity in circulation following trauma in humans and mice was measured using flow cytometry, size exclusion chromatography, and nanoparticle tracking analysis. PEVs were isolated from circulation and the effects on thrombin generation, bleeding time, hemorrhage control, and thrombus formation were determined. Finally, the effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on PEV release and thrombosis were examined. Results Human and murine trauma results in a significant release of PEVs into circulation compared with healthy controls. These PEVs result in abundant thrombin generation, increased platelet aggregation, decreased bleeding times, and decreased hemorrhage in uncontrolled bleeding. Conversely, PEVs contributed to enhanced venous thrombus formation and were recruited to the developing thrombus site. Interestingly, HCQ treatment resulted in decreased platelet aggregation, decreased PEV release, and reduced deep vein thrombosis burden in mice. Conclusions These data demonstrate that trauma results in significant release of PEVs which are both pro-hemostatic and pro-thrombotic. The effects of PEVs can be mitigated by treatment with HCQ, suggesting the potential use as a form of deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

AB  - AbstractSevere extremity trauma often results in large zones of injury comprising multiple types of tissue and presents many clinical challenges for reconstruction. Considerable investigation is ongoing in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine therapeutics to improve reconstruction outcomes; however, the vast majority of musculoskeletal trauma models employed for testing the therapeutics consist of single-tissue defects, offering limited utility for investigating strategies for multi-tissue repair. Here we present the first model of composite lower limb bone and nerve injury, characterized by comparison to well-established, single-tissue injury models, using biomaterials-based technologies previously demonstrated to show promise in those models. Quantitative functional outcome measures were incorporated to facilitate assessment of new technologies to promote structural and functional limb salvage following severe extremity trauma. Nerve injury induced significant changes in the morphology and mechanical properties of intact bones. However, BMP-mediated segmental bone regeneration was not significantly impaired by concomitant nerve injury, as evaluated via radiographs, microcomputed tomography (?CT) and biomechanical testing. Neither was nerve regeneration significantly impaired by bone injury when evaluated via histology and electrophysiology. Despite the similar tissue regeneration observed, the composite injury group experienced a marked functional deficit in the operated limb compared to either of the single-tissue injury groups, as determined by quantitative, automated CatWalk gait analysis. As a whole, this study presents a challenging, clinically relevant model of severe extremity trauma to bone and nerve tissue, and emphasizes the need to incorporate quantitative functional outcome measures to benchmark tissue engineering therapies.

AB  - ABSTRACT Maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following trauma exposure during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of affective disorders in children. To investigate the mechanisms by which prenatal trauma and/or maternal PTSD affect brain development and behavior we established a mouse model of prenatal traumatic (PT) experience based on the application of an electric foot shock to C57Bl/6N female mice on the gestational day 12 during their pregnancy. The model is based on a previously validated animal model of PTSD. We found high anxiety levels and poor maternal care along with reduced serum prolactin and increased corticosterone levels in dams following maternal trauma (MT). PT-pups were born smaller and stayed smaller throughout their life. We show increased time and frequency of ultrasonic calls in PT-pups when separated from the mothers on the postnatal day (PND) 9. Cross-fostering experiments reveal lower anxiety levels in PT pups raised by healthy mothers as compared to trauma-naive pups raised by MT-dams. Importantly, the combination of prenatal trauma and being raised by a traumatized mother leads to: (1) the highest corticosterone levels in pups, (2) longest USV-call time and (3) highest anxiety levels in comparison to other experimental groups. Our data indicates a distinct change in maternal care following MT which is possibly associated with trauma-induced decrease in prolactin levels. Furthermore, we show that maternal behavior is crucial for the development of the offspring anxiety and specific aspects in maternal care overwrite to a significant extend the effects of in utero and postnatal environment. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract:? We tested the independent utility of ?-amyloid precursor protein (?-APP) immunohistochemical staining as evidence of brain trauma in the deaths of young children. Blinded reviewers retrospectively reviewed immunostained brain tissues from homicidal deaths, age-matched control cases without evidence of trauma, as well as cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The reviewers correctly identified five of the seven cases with documented inflicted head trauma. However, one of seven age-matched control cases and one of 10 SIDS/sudden unexplained death in infancy (SUDI) cases demonstrated staining patterns similar to those seen in cases of inflicted trauma. We discuss these cases and the circumstances surrounding them with the intent to explain the difficulties associated with immunohistological interpretation of axonal injury. Although the utility of ?-APP is quite powerful if not confounded by global hypoxic-ischemic injury, ultimately, ?-APP studies should be only one piece of information in the determination of cause and manner of death.

AB  - ABSTRACT Adversity early in life can disrupt the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes and increase risk for negative health outcomes. The interplay between these axes and the environment is complex, and understanding needs to be advanced by the investigation of the multiple hormonal relationships underlying these processes. The current study examined basal hormonal associations between morning levels of cortisol, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone in a cohort of adolescents (mean age 15.56 years). The moderating influence of childhood adversity was also examined, as indexed by self-reported trauma (at mean age 14.91), and observed maternal aggressive parenting (at mean age 12.41). Between-person regressions revealed significant associations between hormones that were moderated by both measures of adversity. In females, all hormones positively covaried, but also interacted with adversity, such that positive covariation was typically only present when levels of trauma and/or aggressive parenting were low. In males, hormonal associations and interactions were less evident; however, interactions were detected for cortisol-testosterone ? positively covarying at high levels of aggressive parenting but negatively covarying at low levels ? and DHEA-cortisol ? similarly positively covarying at high levels of parental aggression. These results demonstrate associations between adrenal and gonadal hormones and the moderating role of adversity, which is likely driven by feedback mechanisms, or cross-talk, between the axes. These findings suggest that hormonal changes may be the pathway through which early life adversity alters physiology and increases health risks, but does so differentially in the sexes; however further study is necessary to establish causation. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Purpose In clinical conditions trauma is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Neutrophils play a key role in the development of multiple organ failure after trauma Experimental design To have a detailed understanding of the neutrophil activation at primary stages after trauma, neutrophils are isolated from control and surgical trauma rats in this study. Extracted proteins are analyzed using nano liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Results A total of 2924 rat neutrophil proteins are identified in our analysis, of which 393 are found differentially regulated between control and trauma groups. By using functional pathways analysis of the 190 proteins up-regulated in surgical trauma, we found proteins related to transcription initiation and protein biosynthesis. On the other hand, among the 203 proteins down-regulated in surgical trauma we found enrichment for proteins of the immune response, proteasome degradation and actin cytoskeleton. Overall, enzyme prediction analysis revealed that regulated enzymes are directly involved in neutrophil apoptosis, directional migration and chemotaxis. Our observations are then confirmed by in silico protein?protein interaction analysis. Conclusions and clinical relevance Collectively, our results reveal that neutrophils drastically regulate their biochemical pathways after the early stages of surgical trauma, showing lower activity. This implies higher susceptibility of the trauma patients to infection and bystander tissues damage.

AB  - Background Shock and severe tissue injury lead to an endogenous coagulopathy mediated by activation of Protein C and hyperfibrinolysis known as acute traumatic coagulopathy. Together, hemodilution, acidosis, inflammation, and hypothermia result in a global trauma-induced coagulopathy. Coagulopathy in trauma is associated with mortality. Early and effective hemostatic resuscitation is critical in restoring perfusion, correcting coagulopathy, and saving lives in exsanguinating trauma. Lyophilized plasma (LP) provides a logistically superior alternative to fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Study Design and Methods Plasma was lyophilized following whole blood collection from anesthetized swine. A series of studies were performed using anesthetized swine subjected to a validated model of polytrauma and hemorrhagic shock including a Grade V liver injury. Animals were randomized to resuscitation using reconstituted LP fluids. Physiologic data and blood loss were measured. Coagulation status and inflammatory mediators were evaluated. Results Full volume reconstituted LP (100%LP) retains on average 86% coagulation factor activity compared to fresh plasma and when used in 1:1 ratios with red blood cells demonstrated superior hemostatic efficacy compared to FFP. Hypertonic LP reconstituted using 50% of the original plasma volume (50%LP) had higher coagulation factor concentrations, was well tolerated in swine, and equally effective compared to 100%LP with respect to physiologic and hemostatic properties. Buffering with ascorbic acid resulted in significant reductions in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6. Conclusion By minimizing the volume of reconstituted LP and optimizing its anti-inflammatory properties, an LP resuscitation fluid may be created to provide effective hemostatic resuscitation with superior logistical properties.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare rectal (CR°), coronary band (PCB°) and ear base (PE°) temperatures with pulmonary arterial temperature (CPA°), and to investigate the relationship between core?peripheral temperature difference ([C???P]t°) and cardiac output (Qt) in an acute ovine trauma model (PIL 60/9064). Study design? Observational study. Animals? Thirteen mixed-breed male sheep, body mass (mean?±?SD) 45.50?±?4.21?kg, aged approximately 1?year. Materials and methods? Anaesthesia was induced with intravenous etomidate 0.5?mg?kg?1 and midazolam 0.5?mg?kg?1 and following endotracheal intubation maintained with halothane in a 2:1 N2O:O2 mixture. The lungs were mechanically ventilated to maintain normocapnia. Core temperature was measured using a pulmonary arterial thermistor. Rectal temperature and peripheral temperatures at the thoracic limb coronary band and ear base were recorded using themistor probes with a multi-channel recorder. Cardiac output was measured by continuous thermodilution. Recordings were taken hourly over a 24-hour period. After baseline data collection, hypovolaemia was induced by haemorrhage from bilateral femoral fractures. The development of hypovolaemic shock was confirmed by falling Qt, central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure and urine output. Resuscitation was attempted using intravenous fluids, inotropes and vasoconstrictors. Nine sheep received lumbosacral extradural bupivacaine. Results? The rectal temperature correlated closely with pulmonary arterial temperature in all sheep (rc?=?0.924). There was no consistent statistically significant relationship between Qt and [C???P]t°. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Rectal temperature accurately reflected core temperature in anaesthetized sheep but [C???P]t° was unrelated to Qt, under the conditions described in this study.
