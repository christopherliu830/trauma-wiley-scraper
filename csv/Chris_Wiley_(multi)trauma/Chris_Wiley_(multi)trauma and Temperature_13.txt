AB  - Abstract Two cases of ruptured non-traumatic aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta and a third in which rupture was imminent are discussed with regard to two simple operative techniques, both of which were employed with success. Partial aneurysmectomy was employed in one case and a temporary to permanent shunt graft in the other two. The simplicity of the techniques is such that they may be used in hospitals which are not equipped for extracorporeal perfusion.

AB  - Abstract Objective To test the efficacy of a piezoelectric instrument (PI) for bone removal during ventral slot surgery. Study Design Ex vivo feasibility study. Sample Population Cadaveric canine cervical spinal specimens (n?=?3; C1?7; C1?T1; C2?T1). Methods The spinal cord of each explanted spinal unit was replaced with a saline-filled latex condom. In 8 disc spaces, ventral slot surgery was performed using a previously reported technique. Bone removal was achieved using a motorized burr (MB). In 8 disc spaces, bone was removed via en bloc ostectomy with a PI that selectively cuts mineralized tissue. Surgical duration and operating field visibility were recorded. Rupture of the fluid filled condom was used as a measure of iatrogenic collateral trauma. Computed tomography was used to measure ventral slot morphometry. Results Mean surgical duration for PI (23.4?minutes) was significantly shorter than for MB (34.1?minutes; P?=?.049). Using a 4 point Likert scale (4?=?excellent, 3?=?good, 2?=?fair, 1?=?poor), median visibility score was significantly higher for PI (2) than for MB (1; P?=?.03). The condom burst twice (1MB, 1PI) during elevation of the dorsal longitudinal ligament; there was no significant difference between techniques for incidence of collateral trauma (P?=?.99). Regardless of surgical technique, there was a bias in slot deviation towards the right (i.e., the surgeon's left; P?=?.021). Conclusions The PI allowed completion of ventral slots in a significantly shorter time, without an increased incidence of iatrogenic trauma. The right-handed surgeon showed a left-sided aiming bias, regardless of surgical technique.

AB  - Abstract Haemorrhagic shock and resuscitation (HS/R) may cause global ischaemia-reperfusion injury, which can result in systemic inflammation, multiorgan failure (particularly liver failure) and high mortality. Hinokitiol, a bioactive tropolone-related compound, exhibits antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory activities. Targeting inflammatory responses is a potential strategy for ameliorating hepatic injury during HS/R. Whether hinokitiol prevents hepatic injury during HS/R remains unclear. In the present study, we determined the role of hinokitiol following HS/R. The in vivo assays revealed that hinokitiol markedly attenuated HS/R-induced hepatic injury. Hinokitiol could inhibited NF-?B activation and IL-6 and TNF-α upregulation in liver tissues. Moreover, hinokitiol reduced caspase-3 activation, upregulated Bax and downregulated Bcl-2. These findings suggest that hinokitiol can ameliorate liver injury following HS/R, partly through suppression of inflammation and apoptosis. Furthermore, the in vitro data revealed that hinokitiol significantly reversed hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced cell death and apoptosis in the primary hepatocytes. Hinokitiol prevented H/R-induced caspase-3 activation, PPAR cleavage, Bax overexpression and Bcl-2 downregulation. Moreover, hinokitiol attenuated H/R-stimulated NF-?B activation and reduced the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α mRNAs, suggesting that hinokitiol can protect hepatocytes from H/R injury. Collectively, our data suggest that hinokitiol attenuates liver injury following HS/R, partly through the inhibition of NF-?B activation.

AB  - Objectives To describe the prevalence, clinical findings and predictors of disease in dogs with cervical hyperaesthesia. Materials and Methods Medical records of dogs referred for neurological investigation of cervical hyperaesthesia between 2009 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Dogs were assigned to one of the following groups according to the final diagnosis: Non-Neurologic, Brain, Cervical Spine, Multifocal, and Chiari-like Malformation/Syringomyelia. Demographic data, clinical and neurological signs and laboratory findings were compared between groups using univariate analysis; predictors of disease location were assessed by multivariate analysis. Results Final diagnostic allocations of the 185 records included in the study were as follows: 2.7% Non-Neurologic, 2.2% Brain, 63.2% Cervical Spine, 22.2% Multifocal and 9.7% Chiari Malformation/Syringomyelia. Intervertebral disc extrusion and steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis were the most common diseases. Compared to Multifocal dogs, those allocated a Cervical Spine diagnosis were older, heavier, more frequently ataxic and lame on a thoracic limb; furthermore, they were less frequently depressed or hyperthermic at presentation. Leucocytosis, neutrophilia and monocytosis were more frequent in dogs allocated a Multifocal diagnosis. Dogs with cervical hyperaesthesia older than 36?months and non-hyperthermic at presentation were more likely to have a lesion of the cervical region rather than a multi-focal disease. Clinical Significance Although non-specific, these results may be useful to guide clinicians in management of dogs presenting with cervical hyperaesthesia. Animal age and body temperature may support the suspicion of either focal or multi-focal cervical spinal disease.

AB  - Objectives??? To evaluate the feasibility and safety of head-neck cooling in conscious normal volunteers (10) and patients with medically refractory epilepsy (5) without causing shivering. Patients and methods??? We used a non-invasive head-neck cooling system (CoolSystems Inc., Lincoln, CA, USA). The tympanic temperature (TT) and intestinal temperature (IT) were measured as two measurements of ?core temperature? (CT), and multi-site external temperatures, several physiologic variables and EEG were monitored. Seizure counts over 4-week precooling, treatment and follow-up phases were compared. Results??? All 15 participants completed all the cooling sessions without significant complaints. At the end of 60?min of cooling, scalp temperature fell on average by 12.2°C (P?<?0.001), TT by 1.67°C (P?<?0.001), and IT by 0.12°C (P?=?NS). Average weekly seizure frequency decreased from 2.7 to 1.7 events per patient per week (MANOVA: P?<?0.05). Conclusions??? Non-invasive head-neck cooling is safe and well-tolerated. Initial pilot data in patients suggest that additional therapeutic studies are warranted.

AB  - Background Exacerbation of cutaneous wound infections and delayed wound closure are frequent complications seen in alcohol exposed subjects who sustain injuries. We previously reported that acute alcohol exposure alters the early dermal inflammatory phase of wound healing and also several parameters of the proliferative wound healing phase in wounds from ethanol (EtOH)-treated mice for several days or weeks after EtOH exposure. Hence, it is likely that the cumulative defects arising in the early phases of the wound healing process directly contribute to the increased complications observed in intoxicated patients at the time of injury. Methods C57BL/6 mice were given intraperitoneal EtOH (2.2 g/kg body weight) or vehicle (saline) EtOH using our episodic binge EtOH exposure protocol (3 days EtOH, 4 days off, 3 days EtOH) to yield a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 300 mg/dl at the time of wounding. Mice were subjected to six 3 mm full-thickness dorsal wounds and immediately treated topically with 10 ?l of sterile saline (control) or diluted Staphylococcus aureus corresponding to 1 ? 104 CFU/wound. Wounds were harvested at 24 hours post injury to evaluate wound area, neutrophil and macrophage accumulation, and the protein levels of cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1?, and IL-10, and chemokines, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and MIP-1α, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC). The abundance and localization of cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP) and the kallikrein epidermal proteases (KLK5 and KLK7) were also determined. Results Compared to control mice, EtOH-treated mice exhibited delayed wound closure, decreased macrophage accumulation, and impaired production of MIP-1α. Furthermore, skin from EtOH-treated mice demonstrated a reduction in the abundance of epidermal CRAMP and KLK7. Conclusions These findings suggest that EtOH exposure hinders several distinct components of the innate immune response, including phagocyte recruitment and chemokine/cytokine and AMP production. Together, these effects likely contribute to delayed wound closure and enhanced infection severity observed in intoxicated patients.

AB  - Abstract Controlling mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) shape is a novel method for investigating and directing MSC behaviour in vitro. it was hypothesized that specifigc MSC shapes can be generated by using stiffness-defined biomaterial surfaces and by applying cyclic tensile forces. Biomaterials used were thin and thick silicone sheets, fibronectin coating, and compacted collagen type I sheets. The MSC morphology was quantified by shape descriptors describing dimensions and membrane protrusions. Nanoscale stiffness was measured by atomic force microscopy and the expression of smooth muscle cell (SMC) marker genes (ACTA2, TAGLN, CNN1) by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Cyclic stretch was applied with 2.5% or 5% amplitudes. Attachment to biomaterials with a higher stiffness yielded more elongated MSCs with fewer membrane protrusions compared with biomaterials with a lower stiffness. For cyclic stretch, compacted collagen sheets were selected, which were associated with the most elongated MSC shape across all investigated biomaterials. As expected, cyclic stretch elongated MSCs during stretch. One hour after cessation of stretch, however, MSC shape was rounder again, suggesting loss of stretch-induced shape. Different shape descriptor values obtained by different stretch regimes correlated significantly with the expression levels of SMC marker genes. Values of approximately 0.4 for roundness and 3.4 for aspect ratio were critical for the highest expression levels of ACTA2 and CNN1. Thus, specific shape descriptor values, which can be generated using biomaterial-associated stiffness and tensile forces, can serve as a template for the induction of specific gene expression levels in MSC.

AB  - Abstract Neurotrauma in the form of traumatic brain injury (TBI) afflicts more Americans annually than Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease combined, yet few researchers have used neuroproteomics to investigate the underlying complex molecular events that exacerbate TBI. Discussed in this review is the methodology needed to explore the neurotrauma proteome?from the types of samples used to the mass spectrometry identification and quantification techniques available. This neuroproteomics survey presents a framework for large-scale protein research in neurotrauma, as applied for immediate TBI biomarker discovery and the far-reaching systems biology understanding of how the brain responds to trauma. Ultimately, knowledge attained through neuroproteomics could lead to clinical diagnostics and therapeutics to lessen the burden of neurotrauma on society. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 25:380?408, 2006

AB  - Abstract Objectives Progesterone (P4) has the potential therapeutic effects for traumatic brain injury (TBI) whose recovery depended on the enhanced angiogenesis. Endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) plays an essential role in vascular biology. We previously demonstrated that P4 administration improved circulating EPC level and neurological recovery of rat with TBI. Here, we hypothesized that P4 augmented angiogenic potential of EPC and the angiogenesis-related neurorestoration after TBI through classical progesterone receptor (PR). Materials and methods EPC derived from rats were stimulated with graded concentrations (0, 10?10, 10?9, 5 ? 10?9, 10?8, 10?7 mol/L) of P4 or 10?6 mol/L ulipristal acetate (UPA, a PR antagonist). Male rats were subjected to cortical impact injury and treated with (i) DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), (ii) P4 and (iii) P4 and UPA. Results It showed that P4 improved the angiogenic potential of EPC, including tube formation, adhesion, migration and vascular endothelial growth factor secretion, in a dose-dependent fashion with the maximal effect achieved at 10?9 mol/L P4. High concentration (10?7 mol/L) of P4 impaired the angiogenic potential of EPC. Notably, 10?6 mol/L UPA antagonized the stimulatory effects of 10?9 mol/L P4. After administrating P4, a significant improvement of neurological function and the restoration of the leaked blood-brain barrier were observed as well as a reduction of the brain water content. Both vessel density and expression of occludin of vessels were increased. When UPA was administered with P4, the neural restoration and angiogenesis were all reversed. Western blot showed that 10?9 mol/L P4 increased the content of PRA and PRB of EPC, while 10?7 mol/L P4 reduced the content of both PR isoforms, but there was no change found in the TBI rats. Conclusions It may suggest that P4-mediated angiogenic activity of EPC and angiogenesis in TBI rats were antagonized by PR antagonist.

AB  - Liver transplantation (LT) with donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors has been associated with a high rate of ischemic-type biliary strictures (ITBSs) and inferior graft survival. To investigate the impact of an intraoperative tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) on outcomes following DCD LT, we conducted a retrospective analysis of DCD LT at the Toronto General Hospital (TGH) and the Ochsner Medical Center (OMC). Between 2009 and 2013, 85 DCD LTs were performed with an intraoperative tPA injection (n?=?30 at TGH, n?=?55 at OMC), and they were compared with 33 DCD LTs without a tPA. Donor and recipient characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. There was no significant difference in the intraoperative packed red blood cell transfusion requirement (3.2?±?3.4 versus 3.1?±?2.3 U, P?=?0.74). Overall, biliary strictures occurred less commonly in the tPA-treated group (16.5% versus 33.3%, P?=?0.07) with a much lower rate of diffuse intrahepatic strictures (3.5% versus 21.2%, P?=?0.005). After 1 and 3 years, the tPA group versus the non-tPA group had superior patient survival (97.6% versus 87.0% and 92.7% versus 79.7%, P?=?0.016) and graft survival (96.4% versus 69.7% and 90.2% versus 63.6%, P?<?0.001). In conclusion, a tPA injection into the hepatic artery during DCD LT reduces ITBSs and improves graft and patient survival without increasing the risk for bleeding.

AB  - Recent findings suggest that extracellular ubiquitin has pleiotropic effects on host defence mechanisms, but its cellular mechanism of action is not yet understood. Using fluorescence and in vivo confocal microscopy, we observed uptake of N-terminal fluorescein-labelled ubiquitin into human PBMC and MonoMac 6 cells. Immunoblotting experiments indicated that extracellular ubiquitin is then rapidly conjugated to a multitude of intracellular proteins. LPS and lipoteichoic acid significantly increased uptake and subsequent conjugation to intracellular proteins dose dependently. This mechanism showed saturation kinetics with a K d value for ubiquitin in the low nanomolar range (<10 nmol/L) and a B max value of 0.14?0.27 ?mol ubiquitin/mg protein. These results suggest that the monocytic ubiquitin system can be targeted with physiologically relevant concentrations of extracellular ubiquitin during inflammation. This concept could provide a simple explanation for a multitude of extracellular ubiquitin's actions and open up new strategies to influence ubiquitin-dependent intracellular processes.

AB  - Abstract ???Crown fractures account for the highest percentage of all traumatic injuries in the permanent dentition. This review paper will discuss the different types of crown fracture, from the uncomplicated to complicated, including crown-root fractures. It will focus on two different aspects: the pulp, with an attempt to correlate epidemiological, experimental, histopathological and clinical studies, so that the clinician can better understand the underlying processes accounting for success or failure to maintain pulp vitality. Also, we will consider the restoration: knowledge about bonding to dentin and new material is evolving extremely quickly making it difficult for the clinician to keep up with the developments. If handled properly, prognosis of the pulp, after traumatic crown fracture, is good. Prognosis of the restoration has also improved considerably over the last few years, and it appears that this trend will continue in the future.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on acute occupational trauma in agriculture resulting from a wound or immediate damage by sudden one-time application of external force. It provides a general description of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries in agriculture and discusses the unique attributes of farm and agriculturally related trauma. Furthermore, the chapter provides: injury statistics and epidemiological data, rescue and medical treatment considerations, and illustrative injury descriptions. It helps to provide an understanding of how agricultural injuries occur and assisting in anticipating medical implications and prevention opportunities. The injury scenarios given in the chapter should enhance understanding of agents, events, causes, treatment, prevention, and rehabilitation of acute traumatic injuries. These scenarios are augmented with special considerations for those who are first on the scene, first responders and rescue personnel, emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and transport personnel, emergency medical treatment providers, primary care providers, secondary/tertiary care providers, and providers of rehabilitation services.

Preoperative and postoperative complete blood count (CBC), plasma fibrinogen concentration, serum amyloid A concentration, peritoneal nucleated cell count, and total protein concentration were compared using repeated measures ANOVA. Surgical times were compared using an unpaired t-test. Mares were monitored for 2 weeks postoperatively and necropsy was performed at 3 weeks (n = 6) or 3 months (n = 6) to assess short- and medium-term effects of each procedure. Complication rate, necropsy, and bacteriology findings were compared using a Fishers exact test. Significance was set at P < .05. Results All surgical procedures were performed successfully and all but one laparoscopy mare were bright, alert, and maintained a good appetite until euthanasia. Mean ± SD surgical time was similar between groups (NOTES: 100 ± 40 minutes; laparoscopy: 107 ± 47 minutes). There were no significant temporal differences in vital parameters, CBC, plasma fibrinogen concentration, serum amyloid A concentration, peritoneal nucleated cell count, and total protein concentration between groups. Conclusions Bilateral ovariectomy by transvaginal NOTES or laparoscopy resulted in minimal inflammation and surgical trauma.

AB  - Summary Acute pain follows surgery, diagnostic procedures, or trauma. In addition, there are many medical conditions that cause acute inflammatory pain. Acute pain after surgery or a diagnostic intervention is preventable with the pre-emptive use of analgesics. Acute pain from trauma cannot be pre-empted, and its treatment may require the use of combinations of drugs and larger dosages. The drugs used to treat acute pain can be divided into five main classes: opioids, local anesthetics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), α-2 adrenoceptor agonists, and miscellaneous drugs or adjuncts. Most opioids have minimal effects on the cardiovascular system and, consequently, are often used in protocols for dogs suffering from cardiovascular disease. The most common adverse effects reported are those associated with the gastrointestinal tract. Physical therapy techniques including passive range of motion, massage, ultrasound, low-level laser, and acupuncture can be useful adjuncts to pharmaceutical treatment of acute pain in dogs.

AB  - Summary Massive haemorrhage is a life-threatening emergency affecting many patient groups. 5?30% of critically ill patients with major blood loss have an accompanying coagulopathy, and this confers a poor prognosis. Successful treatment of severe bleeding is dependent upon many factors, including early identification of any at-risk patient, recognition and treatment of any accompanying coagulopathy, and the proactive delivery of red blood cells (RBC), to maintain tissue oxygenation, and blood components (FFP, platelets), to target the coagulopathy. This chapter will summarize the general haemostatic changes that occur during major blood loss and detail how this information has helped to drive recent changes to transfusion practices. It will focus on the general management of major blood loss and discuss how this may vary according to the different clinical settings.

AB  - Abstract ?-Secretase is an aspartyl protease composed of four proteins: presenilin (PS), nicastrin (Nct), APH1, and PEN2. These proteins assemble into a membrane complex that cleaves a variety of substrates within the transmembrane domain. The ?-secretase cleavage products play an important role in various biological processes such as embryonic development and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The major role of ?-secretase in brain pathology has been linked to AD and to the production of the amyloid ?-peptide. However, little is known about the possible role of ?-secretase following acute brain insult. Here we examined by immunostaining the expression patterns of two ?-secretase components, PS1 and Nct, in three paradigms of brain insult in mice: closed head injury, intracerebroventricular injection of LPS, and brain stabbing. Our results show that in naïve and sham-injured brains expression of PS1 and Nct is restricted mainly to neurons. However, following insult, the expression of both proteins is also observed in nonneuronal cells, consisting of activated astrocytes and microglia. Furthermore, the proteins are coexpressed within the same astrocytes and microglia, implying that these cells exhibit an enhanced ?-secretase activity following brain damage. In view of the important role played by astrocytes and microglia in brain disorders, our findings suggest that ?-secretase may participate in brain damage and repair processes by regulating astrocyte and microglia activation and/or function. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
