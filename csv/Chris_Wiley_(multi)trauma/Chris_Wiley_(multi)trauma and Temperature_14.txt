AB  - We present a young man who developed fat embolism syndrome following a fractured femoral shaft. By intermittently measuring oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter and varying the inspired partial pressure of oxygen we were able to quantify the development of shunt and ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch over the course of his illness. Shunt and low V/Q gradually improved in the week following admission but deteriorated following general anaesthesia for nailing of the femur.

AB  - Abstract Craniocerebral trauma is a serious disease accompanied with mechanical damage, oxidative damage, and neuronal apoptosis. Circular RNA HIPK3 (circHIPK3), an abundant circRNA, exerts the function in promoting cell growth. Therefore, we aimed to explore the biological roles and mechanism of circHIPK3 on cell damage in craniocerebral trauma. PC-12 cells were cotransfected with PLCDH-cirHIPK3 and microRNA-455 (miR-455) inhibitor and then were treated with H2O2 for 24?hours. Cell viability, apoptosis and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) were tested through trypan blue staining, flow cytometry and reactive oxygen species assay, respectively. Expression of circHIPK3 and miR-455 were tested through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Expression of pro-PARP, cleaved-PARP, pro-caspase-3, cleaved-caspase-3, pro-caspase-9, cleaved-caspase-9, ?-actin, beclin-1, p62, light chain 3-I (LC3-I), LC3-II, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), t-extracellular-regulated kinase (t-ERK) and p-ERK were tested via Western blot experiments. The 100??M H2O2-induced cell damage presented as reducing cell viability, increasing apoptosis, autophagy, and MFI. Besides, H2O2 could downregulate circHIPK3. However, overexpression of circHIPK3 attenuated cell damage caused by H2O2 that it increased cell viability, decreased apoptosis, autophagy and MFI through upregulating miR-455. Additionally, circHIPK3 overexpression promoted the activation of Nrf2 and ERK signal pathways by upregulating miR-455. Our study demonstrated that circHIPK3 attenuated H2O2-induced cell damage and activated Nrf2 and ERK signal pathways by upregulation of miR-455.

AB  - Summary In this chapter, the author reframes the self-preservation system and moves it away from the natural vital order to show how it is a vital body set-up derived from the other who regulates the biological processes through attachment and cultural habit. She also identifies how the relation with the other, and therefore also a vital set-up, results in deregulation which is both sexual and related to trauma. A state of Unheimlich can be interpreted as a state of feeling not at home in the hearth of the home; it is used in the discussion of the somatic symptom to suggest feeling radically estranged on somatic sensory states and in one's own body, bringing otherness, which is at the heart of somatic being, to the fore. In the context of the uncanny, it means feeling uncomfortable and strange in one's own body.

AB  - Summary This chapter first briefly talks about leg ulcers, which are the most common chronic wounds in developed countries affecting 1?3% of the British population. It then discusses lower limb trauma. The annual incidence of open lower limb fractures is approximately 5 per 100,000 population. Most common mechanisms of injury include: (i) Fall from height; (ii) Motor vehicle collision; and (iii) Interpersonal violence. A brief discussion of osteomyelitis, which is inflammation of bone caused by an infecting organism, is then presented. The discussion includes classification, mechanism of infection, pathology, investigation and treatment. The chapter also describes the pathogenesis, classification, staging, clinical diagnosis, and surgical management of lymphoedema. Finally it presents a brief discussion of pressure ulcers.

AB  - Abstract Scaffolds play a key role in the field of tissue engineering. Particularly for meniscus replacement, optimal scaffold properties are critical. The aim of our study was to develop a novel scaffold for replacement of meniscal tissue by means of tissue engineering. Emphasis was put on biomechanical properties comparable to native meniscus, nonimmunogenecity, and the possibility of seeding cells into and cultivating them within the scaffold (nontoxicity). For this purpose, native ovine menisci were treated in vitro in a self-developed enzymatic process. Complete cell removal was achieved and shown both histologically and electron microscopically (n?=?15). Immunohistochemical reaction (MHC 1/MHC 2) was positive for native ovine meniscus and negative for the scaffold. Compared to native meniscus (25.8 N/mm) stiffness of the scaffold was significantly increased (30.2 N/mm, p?<?0.05, n?=?10). We determined the compression (%) of the native meniscus and the scaffold under a load of 7 N. The compression was 23% for native meniscus and 29% for the scaffold (p?<?0.05, n?=?10). Residual force of the scaffold was significantly lower (5.2 N vs. 4.9 N, p?<?0.05, n?=?10). Autologous fibrochondrocytes were needle injected and successfully cultivated within the scaffolds over a period of 4 weeks (n?=?10). To our knowledge, this study is the first to remove cells and immunogenetic proteins (MHC 1/MHC 2) completely out of native meniscus and preserve important biomechanical properties. Also, injected cells could be successfully cultivated within the scaffold. Further in vitro and in vivo animal studies are necessary to establish optimal cell sources, sterilization, and seeding techniques. Cell differentiation, matrix production, in vivo remodeling of the construct, and possible immunological reactions after implantation are subject of further studies. ? 2007 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a thermal mode Erbium:YAG laser several in-vivo morphological as well as clinical changes were monitored in a multi-center investigation. Study Design/Materials and Methods An Erbium:YAG laser was used at a thermal mode with sub-ablative fluences of 2.1 and 3.1 J/cm2 with parallel air cooling to treat either periorbital, perioral rhytides or patients with post-traumatic or acne scars. Two treatments were applied 2 months apart, with follow-up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. Photographs were taken before and at each follow-up visit and evaluated by three blinded independent reviewers. Histology and immunohistochemistry for pro-collagen expression were investigated. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed before, and at 4, 14, and 28 days after single pass treatment with Erbium:YAG thermal pulses. Results The improvement of rhytides at 1?3 months follow-up was graded as excellent in 19%, good in 19%, fair in 31%, and no improvement in 31%. At the 6- to 12-month follow-up, the improvement was excellent in 40%, good in 40%, fair in 20%, and no improvement in 0%. The improvement of scars at 3?6 months follow-up was graded as excellent in 50%, good in 25%, fair in 25%, and no improvement in 0%. Intra- and post-operative discomfort was described as mild by the patients. OCT, histological sections and immunohistochemistry demonstrated production of new collagen bundles. Conclusions Thermal Erbium:YAG pulses can induce collagen neogenesis, as proved by temperature elevation and morphological changes in the upper dermis. This leads clinically to visible and long lasting reduction of wrinkles and scars after applying multiple passes with minimal side-effects. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Objective: To describe the rates of serious bacterial illness (SBI) in children presenting to emergency departments (EDs) with first-time uncomplicated febrile seizures. Methods: The ED visits from seven Chicago metropolitan area hospitals (two tertiary pediatric EDs, five community general EDs) for all pediatric patients seen between July 1995 and December 1997 with a discharge diagnosis including the term ?seizure? were retrospectively identified. Records of patients who met criteria for simple, first-time febrile seizure were reviewed (age 6-60 months; temperature ≥38.0°C; single, generalized, tonic?clonic seizure <20 minutes; absence of known central nervous system disease). Rates of bacteremia, urinary tract infection, bacterial meningitis, and pneumonia were determined. Results: Four hundred fifty-five children were identified who had first-time simple febrile seizures. The study participants had a mean age of 21 months and a mean temperature of 39.6°C, and 64% were male. Seventy-three percent were seen in a community hospital setting. Blood cultures were obtained for 315 children (69%). Four children (1.3% [95% CI = 0.1% to 2.5%]) were bacteremic, all with Streptococcus pneumoniae; the rate of bacteremia did not differ in the subset at highest risk for bacteremia (6-36 months, temperature >39°C). No demographic or laboratory data distinguished the bacteremic children from those with negative blood cultures. One hundred seventy-one children (38%) had urine cultures obtained; 5.9% [95% CI = 2.4% to 9.4%] of the cultures grew >100,000 colony-forming units/mL of a single pathogenic organism. One hundred thirty-five children (30%) had cerebrospinal fluid cultures performed. None of these cultures grew a bacterial pathogen [95% CI = 0% to 2.2%]. Two hundred eight children (45.7%) had chest x-rays performed; 12.5% [95% CI = 10.2% to 14.8%] (n= 26) of the x-rays were read as consistent with pneumonia by the radiologist at the treating institution. None of the blood cultures performed on children with abnormal radiographs were positive (cultures drawn on 23 of 26 patients, 88%). Stool cultures were performed on 14 children (3.1%); two cultures (14.3% [95% CI = 0% to 32.6%]) grew a bacterial pathogen, both Shigella. Conclusions: Rates of SBI in this multi-institution population of children with first-time simple febrile seizures were low and are consistent with those published in the literature for febrile children without seizures.

AB  - Introduction Exercise can provide numerous benefits to haemophilia patients, including bleeding reduction in muscles and joints. Aim This systematic review (SR) aims to evaluate the effects of physical exercise on pain and the musculoskeletal function of patients with hemophilia. Methods Literature searches of Pubmed, Web of Science, PEDro, Cochrane, Clinical Trials SciELO and Lilacs were performed. The risks of bias were measured using the JADAD scale. Results Nine controlled clinical trials were included in the SR. Conclusion Physical exercise can promote a reduction in the perception of pain and can increase ROM and muscle strength in haemophilia patients. Future RCTs with greater methodological rigor that focus on the parameters used to prescribe exercises are necessary.

AB  - Abstract Neck pain and whiplash injuries are a common presentation to the ED, and a frequent cause of disability globally. This rapid review investigated best practice for the assessment and management of musculoskeletal neck pain in the ED. PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, TRIP and the grey literature, including relevant organisational websites, were searched in 2017. Primary studies, systematic reviews and guidelines were considered for inclusion. English-language articles published in the past 12 years addressing acute neck pain assessment, management or prognosis in the ED were included. Data extraction was conducted, followed by quality appraisal to rate levels of evidence where possible. The search revealed 2080 articles, of which 51 were included (n?=?22 primary articles, n?=?13 systematic reviews and n?=?16 guidelines). Consistent evidence was found to support the use of ?red flags? to screen for serious pathologies, judicious use of imaging through clinical decision rule application and promotion of functional exercise coupled with advice and reassurance. Clinicians may also consider applying risk-stratification methods, such as using a clinical prediction rule, to guide patient discharge and referral plans; however, the evidence is still emerging in this population. This rapid review provides clinicians managing neck pain in the ED a summary of the best available evidence to enhance quality of care and optimise patient outcomes.

AB  - The parenteral multivitamin preparations that are commercially available in the United States (U.S.) meet the requirements for most patients who receive parenteral nutrition (PN). However, a separate parenteral vitamin D preparation (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) should be made available for treatment of patients with vitamin D deficiency unresponsive to oral vitamin D supplementation. Carnitine is commercially available and should be routinely added to neonatal PN formulations. Choline should also be routinely added to adult and pediatric PN formulations; however, a commercially available parenteral product needs to be developed. The parenteral multi?trace element (TE) preparations that are commercially available in the U.S. require significant modifications. Single-entity trace element products can be used to meet individual patient needs when the multiple-element products are inappropriate (see Summary/A.S.P.E.N. Recommendations section for details of these proposed modifications).

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the effect of intravenous infusion of amino acids on the prevention of hypothermia during anaesthesia in dogs. Study design Randomized experimental trial. Animals Seven healthy Beagle dogs. Methods Four concentrations of amino acids were prepared with a 10% amino acid solution and an acetated Ringer's solution, and dogs were infused with each of the solutions at 1 week intervals. Dogs were infused with amino acid solution at 12 mL kg?1 hour?1 for 60 minutes before and for 60 minutes after induction of anaesthesia. Acetated Ringer's solution was infused at the same rate for the remaining 60 minutes of anaesthesia. The infusion treatments were: 1) A0, nutrient-free acetated Ringer's solution; 2) A6, 0.6 g kg?1 hour?1; 3) A9, 0.9 g kg?1 hour?1; and 4) A12, 1.2 g kg?1 hour?1. Rectal temperature (RT), heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), blood insulin, glucose, urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine concentrations, and time to extubation were measured. Results Before anaesthesia, RT was not affected by amino acid infusion. RT decreased progressively during anaesthesia and the absolute values of RT from 30 to 120 minutes were significantly higher in A12 than in A0 (p < 0.05). Reductions in HR and MAP during anaesthesia were attenuated by amino acid infusion in a dose-dependent manner. Plasma insulin concentration was significantly higher in A12 than in A0 during amino acid infusion and the increase in insulin concentration was greater during than before anaesthesia. BUN increased during amino acid infusion in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Time until extubation was shorter in A12 than in A0. Conclusions and clinical relevance Amino acids infused at 1.2 g kg?1 hour?1 in dogs attenuated the decrease in RT, HR, and MAP during anaesthesia, and induced a significant increase in plasma insulin concentration.

AB  - Abstract Chromosomal aberrations were investigated in nuclei extracted from synovial tissue and first-passage synovial fibroblasts (P-1 SFB, 98% enrichment) or macrophages (P-1 M?) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 10). The findings were compared with those in other rheumatic diseases (osteoarthritis, n = 14; reactive arthritis, n = 1), as well as with those in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 8). Controls were paired peripheral blood lymphocytes from arthritic patients, synovial tissue or SFB/M? from joint trauma/normals (n = 9), and peripheral blood monocytes from normal donors (n = 10). GTG banding of metaphase chromosomes and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization with centromere-specific probes were used. Comparable chromosomal aberrations were observed in synovial tissue and P-1 SFB of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and reactive arthritis (polysomy 7 and aneusomies of chromosomes 4, 8, 9, 12, and 18). Notably, aneusomies of chromosomes 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and/or X were also detected in P-1 synovial M? from rheumatoid arthritis (90% of the cases), osteoarthritis (93%), and reactive arthritis (1/1), as well as bronchial M? from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (25%). No aberrations were detected in paired peripheral blood lymphocytes (except for one osteoarthritis case with a karyotype 45,X[10]/46,XX[17]), or in peripheral blood monocytes and synovial tissue of normals/joint trauma. Because M? aberrations were common to chronic joint and pulmonary disease, chronic inflammatory stress may induce chromosomal aberrations with potential functional relevance in local mesenchymal cells and infiltrating leukocytes in an organ-independent fashion. ? 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - A 16-year-old male was transported to our emergency department after he was kicked in the abdomen by a horse. He was diagnosed with injury of the liver and abdominal rectus muscle, and was cured by observational treatment. An Ichushi search was undertaken to identify articles published from 1983 to 2013 using the key words ?horse? and ?trauma?. We found 13 cases that described horse-related injuries and summarized these cases, including our case. There were 10 males, three females and one patient of an undescribed sex. The patients ranged in age from 16 to 58 years old, with an average age of 33 years. The injured sites were predominantly the face (mandible) and upper abdomen, indicating that a projecting part of the body may be more likely to be injured. Cardiac rupture, aortic head injury, or lethality induced by a horse kick have not been reported in Japan, but such injuries have been reported in other countries. Ten of 15 cases (67%) required surgical treatment for severe injuries. Horse kick injuries tend to be severe, because the transfer of energy from the end of the hoof, with a small cross-sectional area, to a small field, leads to internal organic injuries that are more severe than predicted, similar to a handlebar injury. Accordingly, we advocate the close observation of patients with horse kick injuries, which may be regarded as being similar to blunt stab wounds or hidden speared injuries.

AB  - Addition of increased amounts of serum and a protein (peroxidase from horseradish) to the culture medium caused structural alterations in previously confluent cultures composed of cells from the human retinal pigment epithelium and choroid. The alterations consisted in the formation of bi- and multi-layered strands, plaques and nodular structures and in the detachment of cells with formation of nude areas. These alterations resemble the frequently observed reactive alterations at the chorio-retinal junction in eyes with inflammation, trauma, retinal detachment and certain degenerative disease processes as the senile disciform macula degeneration.

AB  - Abstract Three-dimensional (3D) printing, or additive manufacturing, is now a widely used tool in pre-operative planning, surgical teaching and simulator training. However, 3D printing technology that produces models with accurate haptic feedback, biomechanics and visuals for the training surgeon is not currently available. Challenges and opportunities in creating such surgical models will be discussed in this review paper. Surgery requires proper tissue handling as well as knowledge of relevant anatomy. To prepare doctors properly, training models need to take into account the biomechanical properties of the anatomical structures that will be manipulated in any given operation. This review summarises and evaluates the current biomechanical literature as it relates to human tissues and correlates the impact of this knowledge on developing high fidelity 3D printed surgical training models. We conclude that, currently, a printer technology has not yet been developed which can replicate many of the critical qualities of human tissue. Advances in 3D printing technology will be required to allow the printing of multi-material products to achieve the mechanical properties required.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To evaluate and compare the clinical effects of dexmedetomidine (DEX) and medetomidine (MED) in cats, and their reversal with atipamezole (ATI). Study design? Prospective blinded randomized multi-centre clinical trial. Animals? One hundred and twenty client-owned cats. Methods? Cats were randomly allocated to receive a single intramuscular (IM) injection of either DEX (0.04?mg?kg?1, n?=?62) or MED (0.08?mg?kg?1, n?=?58) for minor procedures requiring sedation and analgesia. Afterwards, ATI (0.2?mg?kg?1) was administered IM to half the cats, randomly assigned. Prior to, during and after the procedure the sedative, analgesic and cardiorespiratory effects and body temperature were assessed. Results? Dexmedetomidine and MED produced clinically and statistically comparable effects. The intended procedure(s) could be performed in over 90% of cats. Sedation and analgesia were apparent within 5?minutes, peak effects were observed at approximately 30?minutes and spontaneous recovery occurred by 180?minutes of injection. Heart and respiratory rate and body temperature decreased significantly over time and had not returned to baseline values 180?minutes after administration. ATI administration completely reversed the sedative and analgesic effects, returned the heart rate to normal and prevented any further reductions in respiratory rate and body temperature in both DEX- and MED-treated cats. The reporting of adverse events was low and the most commonly observed event was vomiting (7%). No serious adverse events or concerns regarding safety were reported. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Dexmedetomidine (0.04?mg?kg?1) produced comparable sedative and analgesic effects to MED (0.08?mg?kg?1) in cats. DEX produced adequate sedation and analgesia for radiography, grooming, dental care and lancing of abscesses. ATI fully reversed the clinical effects of DEX.

AB  - SUMMARY Massive transfusion or major haemorrhage protocols have been widely adopted in the treatment of critically bleeding patients. Following evidence that higher ratios of transfused plasma and platelets to red blood cells may offer survival benefits in military trauma patients, these ratios are now commonly incorporated into massive transfusion protocols. They more closely resemble the effects of whole blood transfusion, which in the second half of last century was largely replaced by individual blood component transfusion based on laboratory-guided indicators. However, high-quality evidence to guide transfusion support for critically bleeding patients across the range of bleeding contexts is lacking, including for both trauma and non-trauma patients. More data on major haemorrhage support and clinical outcomes are needed to inform guidelines and practice.

AB  - Abstract There is increasing evidence that titanium ions are released from orthopedic implants by biocorrosion. The aim of this study was to investigate titanium uptake by human T-lymphocytes and its effects on phenotype and proliferation. Freshly isolated human nonadherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells (NA-PBMC), were exposed to TiCl4 [Ti(IV)]. Bioavailability and distribution of Ti(IV) in T-lymphocytes was determined by energy-filtered electron microscopy (EFTEM). The effects of Ti(IV) challenge on nonactivated and PHA-activated cells were assessed by flow cytometric analysis of surface markers, RANK-L production, and proliferation assays. EFTEM colocalized Ti(IV) with phosphorus in the nucleus, ribosomes, cytoplasmic membranes, and the surface membrane of T-lymphocytes. Ti(IV) increased significantly the expression of CD69, CCR4, and RANK-L in a concentration-dependent manner. Titanium enters T-lymphocytes through a currently unknown mechanism and binds to phosphorus-rich cell structures. Titanium influences phenotype and function of T-lymphocytes, resulting in activation of a CD69+ and CCR4+ T-lymphocyte population and secretion of RANK-L. These results strongly suggest the involvement of titanium ions challenged T-lymphocytes in the complex pathophysiological mechanisms of aseptic loosening of orthopedic implants. ? 2009 Orthopaedic Research Society.
