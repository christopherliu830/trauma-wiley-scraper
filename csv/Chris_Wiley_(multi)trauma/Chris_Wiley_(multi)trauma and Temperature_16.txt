AB  - Abstract Mammalian hibernation consists of periods of depressed metabolism and reduced body temperature called ?torpor? that are interspersed by normothermic arousal periods. Numerous cellular processes are halted during torpor, including transcription, translation, and ion homeostasis. Hibernators are able to survive long periods of low blood flow and body temperature followed by rewarming and reperfusion without overt signs of organ injury, which makes these animals excellent models for application of natural protective mechanisms to human medicine. This review examines efforts to induce torpor-like states in non-hibernating species using pharmacological compounds. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms of natural and pharmacologically induced torpor will speed the development of new clinical approaches to treat a variety of trauma and stress states in humans.

AB  - The anatomical response of Norway spruce bark polyphenolic parenchyma cells (PP cells) to inoculation with the phytopathogenic fungus Ceratocystis polonica and attack by its bark-beetle vector Ips typographus was examined. Fungal inoculation on the periderm surface had no effect, while inoculation just below the periderm or halfway into the phloem (mid-phloem) generated detectable responses within 3 wk. The responses included increase in PP cell size and in periodic acid-Schiff's staining of PP cell phenolics, wound periderm initiation from PP cells, and cambial zone traumatic resin duct formation. Fungi were not seen in samples 3 wk after subperiderm or mid-phloem inoculation, but were found in some samples 6 and 9 wk after mid-phloem inoculation. In contrast, inoculations into the cambium resulted in partial (3 wk) or complete (6 and 9 wk) fungal colonization and death of tissue in the infected area. This indicates that PP cells have defenses capable of inhibiting fungal growth. Samples taken near bark-beetle galleries had similar anatomical responses as inoculated samples, validating the inoculation approach to studying defense responses in spruce. These results show that PP cells represent not only a constitutive defense system, but are also involved in local and remote inducible defenses against fungal and beetle attack.

AB  - Background and Objective Low-level light therapy (LLLT) has been revealed as a potential means to improve wound healing. So far, most studies are being performed with irradiation in the red to near-infrared spectra. Recently, we showed that blue light (470?nm) can significantly influence biological systems such as nitric oxide (NO) metabolism and is able to release NO from nitrosyl-hemoglobin or mitochondrial protein complexes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the therapeutic value of blue or red light emitting diodes (LEDs) on wound healing in an ischemia disturbed rodent flap model. Study Design/Materials and Methods An abdominal flap was rendered ischemic by ligation of one epigastric bundle and subjected to LED illumination with a wavelength of 470?nm (blue, n?=?8) or 629?nm (red, n?=?8) each at 50?mW/cm2 and compared to a non-treated control group (n?=?8). Illumination was performed for 10?minutes on five consecutive days. Results LED therapy with both wavelengths significantly increased angiogenesis in the sub-epidermal layer and intramuscularly (panniculus carnosus muscle) which was associated with significantly improved tissue perfusion 7 days after the ischemic insult. Accordingly, tissue necrosis was significantly reduced and shrinkage significantly less pronounced in the LED-treated groups of both wavelengths. Conclusions LED treatment of ischemia challenged tissue improved early wound healing by enhancing angiogenesis irrespective of the wavelength thus delineating this noninvasive means as a potential, cost effective tool in complicated wounds.

AB  - Summary The practice of war surgery has a longstanding relationship with the speciality of plastic and reconstructive surgery. The relationship has often fostered new and often ground-breaking developments in medicine and surgery. The last decade of conflict has been no different. Understanding the history and principles of war surgery is paramount to its practice. This chapter aims to distil the salient practices learnt from recent conflicts through understanding of what wounds soldiers at war and the compounding factors that make surgery more arduous in war conditions. Furthermore, the chapter will give a concise understanding of blast and penetrating injury and develop this in the methods of applying plastic and reconstructive surgery military surgical teams.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The Australian and New Zealand Haemostasis Registry (ANZHR) included patients who received off-licence recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) for critical bleeding from 2000 to 2009. Approximately 1.3% of the ANZHR patients were Jehovah's Witnesses (JWs). We compared them with the non-JW patients in the registry. Methods Patient characteristics (e.g. gender, context of bleeding), factors influencing rFVIIa use (e.g. body temperature and pH) and outcomes (e.g. bleeding response (stopped/attenuated or unchanged) to rFVIIa, mortality) were compared between JW and non-JW patients using Fisher's exact chi-square tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results A total of 42 JW and 3134 non-JW patients were included in the analysis. Approximately 99% (n = 3098) of non-JWs received blood products compared with only 30% (n = 13) of JWs (P < 0.01). The distribution of gender and contexts of critical bleeding in the two groups was significantly different. Approximately 17% of the non-JW patients were hypothermic (T < 35°C) and about 19% were acidotic (pH < 7.2) at the time of initial rFVIIa administration. Conversely, none of the JWs were hypothermic and only one was acidotic. The proportion of positive responders to rFVIIa (stopped/attenuated bleeding following rFVIIa use) was similar in both groups (75% non-JWs, 74% JWs; P = 1.0). Approximately 28% of non-JW and 17% of JW patients were deceased by day 28 following rFVIIa use (P = 0.16). Discussion Several factors were observed to be significantly different between JW and non-JW patients, yet the proportions of responders to rFVIIa were similar in both groups. The actual factors influencing response to rFVIIa are yet to be determined.

AB  - Purpose? Prospective validation of recently established independent predictors for postinjury abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) was performed. Methodology? All trauma patients who met inclusion criteria (ICU admission, ISS?>?15, Base Deficit (BD)?>?5, or resuscitation with >5?L crystalloids) were prospectively monitored. Patients with isolated head injuries were excluded. Demographics, ISS, resuscitation fluids, physiological parameters, intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and the independent predictors in two time windows ?ED discharge?[SBP, crystalloids, Time-to OR, transfusions] and ?ICU admission?[crystalloids, urine output (UO), Hb, Temperature, BD] were collected. Data are presented as mean ?±? SEM, p?<?0.05 considered significant. Results? Twenty-two blunt trauma patients were monitored (Age 39?±?5 years, 77% males, ISS 32?±?2, SBP 107?±?5 mmHg, BD 7?±?1). No patients developed ACS. Seven patients developed IAH (IAP?>?20?mmHg). IAH and non-IAH patients had the same age (41?±?7 vs 37?±?5?yrs) and admission BD (7.5?±?1.3 vs 6.3?±?1.2). IAH patients had higher ISS than non-IAH patients (39?±?3 vs 30?±?2). Outcomes (IAH vs non-IAH): ICU LOS (39?±?3 vs 30?±?2), Mortality (0% vs 7%), MOF (29% vs 0%). ?ED-discharge predictors?: The IAH and non-IAH patients had similar admission SBP, ED crystalloid volume, transfusions and ED time. ?ICU-admission predictors?: IAH and non-IAH patients had similar UO, crystalloid infusions, BD, temperature but the IAH group had lower Hb (99?±?5 vs 111?±?3?g/dl) than the non-IAH patients. Conclusions? The incidence of ACS decreased from 14% to 0% in a comparable population. The predictors for ACS did not predict IAH. After the elimination of the lethal ACS, the clinical importance of postinjury IAH has to be defined.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) play a pivotal role in modern therapeutic approaches in bone-healing disorders. Although bone marrow-derived MSCs are most frequently used, the knowledge that many other adult tissues represent promising sources for potent MSCs has gained acceptance. In the present study, the osteogenic differentiation potential of porcine skin fibroblasts (FBs), as well as bone marrow- (BMSCs), adipose tissue- (ASCs) and dental pulp-derived stromal cells (DSCs) were evaluated. However, additional application of BMP-2 significantly elevated the delayed osteogenic differentiation capacity of ASC and FB cultures, and in DSC cultures the supplementation of platelet-rich plasma increased osteogenic differentiation potential to a comparable level of the good differentiable BMSCs. Furthermore, microarray gene expression performed in an exemplary manner for ASCs and BMSCs revealed that ASCs and BMSCs use different gene expression patterns for osteogenic differentiation under standard media conditions, as diverse MSCs are imprinted dependent from their tissue niche. However, after increasing the differentiation potential of ASCs to a comparable level as shown in BMSCs, a small subset of identical key molecules was used to differentiate in the osteogenic lineage. Until now, the importance of identified genes seems to be underestimated for osteogenic differentiation. Apparently, the regulation of transmembrane protein 229A, interleukin-33 and the fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 in the early phase of osteogenic differentiation is needed for optimum results. Based on these results, bone regeneration strategies of MSCs have to be adjusted, and in vivo studies on the osteogenic capacities of the different types of MCSs are warranted.

AB  - ABSTRACT The osteocyte product sclerostin is emerging as an important paracrine regulator of bone mass. It has recently been shown that osteocyte production of receptor activator of NF-?B ligand (RANKL) is important in osteoclastic bone resorption, and we reported that exogenous treatment of osteocytes with sclerostin can increase RANKL-mediated osteoclast activity. There is good evidence that osteocytes can themselves liberate mineral from bone in a process known as osteocytic osteolysis. In the current study, we investigated sclerostin-stimulated mineral dissolution by human primary osteocyte-like cells (hOCy) and mouse MLO-Y4 cells. We found that sclerostin upregulated osteocyte expression of carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2/Car2), cathepsin K (CTSK/Ctsk), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (ACP5/Acp5). Because acidification of the extracellular matrix is a critical step in the release of mineral from bone, we further examined the regulation by sclerostin of CA2. Sclerostin stimulated CA2 mRNA and protein expression in hOCy and in MLO-Y4 cells. Sclerostin induced a decrease in intracellular pH (pHi) in both cell types as well as a decrease in extracellular pH (pHo) and the release of calcium ions from mineralized substrate. These effects were reversed in the co-presence of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetozolamide. Car2-siRNA knockdown in MLO-Y4 cells significantly inhibited the ability of sclerostin to both reduce the pHo and release calcium from a mineralized substrate. Knockdown in MLO-Y4 cells of each of the putative sclerostin receptors, Lrp4, Lrp5 and Lrp6, using siRNA, inhibited the sclerostin induction of Car2, Catk and Acp5 mRNA, as well as pHo and calcium release. Consistent with this activity of sclerostin resulting in osteocytic osteolysis, human trabecular bone samples treated ex vivo with recombinant human sclerostin for 7 days exhibited an increased osteocyte lacunar area, an effect that was reversed by the co-addition of acetozolamide. These findings suggest a new role for sclerostin in the regulation of perilacunar mineral by osteocytes. ? 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Abstract Objective The objective was to track and compare the progression of neuroplastic changes in a large animal model and humans with spinal cord injury. Methods A total of 37 individuals with acute traumatic spinal cord injury were followed over time (1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury) with repeated neurophysiological assessments. Somatosensory and motor evoked potentials were recorded in the upper extremities above the level of injury. In a reverse-translational approach, similar neurophysiological techniques were examined in a porcine model of thoracic spinal cord injury. Twelve Yucatan mini-pigs underwent a contusive spinal cord injury at T10 and tracked with somatosensory and motor evoked potentials assessments in the fore- and hind limbs pre- (baseline, post-laminectomy) and post-injury (10 min, 3 h, 12 weeks). Results In both humans and pigs, the sensory responses in the cranial coordinates of upper extremities/forelimbs progressively increased from immediately post-injury to later time points. Motor responses in the forelimbs increased immediately after experimental injury in pigs, remaining elevated at 12 weeks. In humans, motor evoked potentials were significantly higher at 1-month (and remained so at 1 year) compared to normative values. Conclusions Despite notable differences between experimental models and the human condition, the brain's response to spinal cord injury is remarkably similar between humans and pigs. Our findings further underscore the utility of this large animal model in translational spinal cord injury research.

AB  - Objectives: To review aetiology, clinical signs and outcome of cats surgically treated for septic peritonitis (2000-2007). Methods: A retrospective study. Inclusion criteria were the identification of intracellular bacteria and degenerate neutrophils and/or a positive culture from abdominal fluid and exploratory coeliotomy. Aetiology, clinical signs, haematological and biochemical parameters, surgical treatment and outcome were recorded and analysed. Results: Twenty-six cats fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Abdominal pain was reported in 10 (38 per cent) and vomiting was reported in 11 (42 per cent) of the cats. The most common aetiology was trauma (31 per cent). The principal source of contamination was the gastrointestinal tract. Hyperlactataemia, hypoproteinaemia and hyperglycaemia were reported in 9, 13 and 14 of the 26 cases, respectively. Non-survivors had significantly higher blood lactate concentrations than survivors (P=0·02). Nineteen cats were managed with primary closure, two with closed suction drains and three with open peritoneal drainage. Twelve (46 per cent) cats survived to discharge. Clinical Significance: In cats, lethargy, depression and anorexia were more common clinical signs than abdominal pain. Lactate level at the time of diagnosis may be a useful prognostic indicator in cats. The proportion of cats that survived was lower than previously reported and owners should be given a guarded prognosis.

AB  - Abstract Superficial skin erosion wounds are very common in the clinic, and conventional treatments are not always effective; thus, effective and novel therapy is needed. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) has been recognised as a promising approach to wound healing. The purpose of this study is to show the potential clinical application of CAP for the healing of different kinds of superficial skin wounds. Seven patients with different kinds of superficial skin wounds (two patients with pyoderma gangrenosum, two patients with trauma would, one patient with giant genital wart, one patient with diabetic foot, and one patient with chronic eczema) were recruited to this study. All patients accepted and received CAP treatment every other day till the wound healed. The expected results were complete wound healing after CAP treatment. All patients achieved complete wound healing after several rounds (range from two to eight) of CAP treatment, and there was no side effect observed. CAP may provide a new and effective choice to solve the problem of the healing of superficial wounds that are not only caused by trauma but also because of eczema. CAP has certain value in the treatment of superficial skin diseases in the future.

AB  - Abstract This manuscript constitutes a review of several innovative biomedical technologies fabricated using the precision and accuracy of silicon micro- and nanofabrication. The technologies to be reviewed are subcutaneous nanochannel drug delivery implants for the continuous tunable zero-order release of therapeutics, multi-stage logic embedded vectors for the targeted systemic distribution of both therapeutic and imaging contrast agents, silicon and porous silicon nanowires for investigating cellular interactions and processes as well as for molecular and drug delivery applications, porous silicon (pSi) as inclusions into biocomposites for tissue engineering, especially as it applies to bone repair and regrowth, and porous silica chips for proteomic profiling. In the case of the biocomposites, the specifically designed pSi inclusions not only add to the structural robustness, but can also promote tissue and bone regrowth, fight infection, and reduce pain by releasing stimulating factors and other therapeutic agents stored within their porous network. The common material thread throughout all of these constructs, silicon and its associated dielectrics (silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, etc.), can be precisely and accurately machined using the same scalable micro- and nanofabrication protocols that are ubiquitous within the semiconductor industry. These techniques lend themselves to the high throughput production of exquisitely defined and monodispersed nanoscale features that should eliminate architectural randomness as a source of experimental variation thereby potentially leading to more rapid clinical translation.

AB  - Summary Hordenine is an alkaloid occurring naturally in grains, sprouting barley, and certain grasses. It is occasionally found in post race urine samples, and therefore we investigated its pharmacological actions in the horse. Hordenine (2.0 mg/kg bodyweight [bwt]) was administered by rapid intravenous (iv) injection to 10 horses. Typically, dosed horses showed a flehmen response and defecated within 60 secs. All horses showed substantial respiratory distress. Respiratory rates increased about 250 per cent and heart rates were approximately double that of resting values. All animals broke out in a sweat shortly after iv injection, but basal body temperature was not affected. These effects were transient, and the animals appeared normal within 30 mins of dosing. Treated horses were tested in a variable interval responding apparatus 30 mins after dosing and no residual stimulation or depressant effects of hordenine were apparent. Animals dosed orally with 2.0 mg/kg bwt of hordenine showed no changes in heart rate, respiratory rate, basal body temperature or behaviour. After iv injection of hordenine, (2.0 mg/kg bwt) plasma reached a maximum value of about 1.0 ?g/ml, and declined thereafter in a biexponential fashion. Kinetics of plasma concentration satisfied the concept of a two compartment open system, with an α-phase half-life of about 3 mins, and a ß-phase half-life of about 35 mins. Total urinary concentrations of hordenine (free and conjugated) peaked at about 400 ?g/ml, and then declined exponentially to background levels by 24 h after dosing. Oral administration of hordenine (2.0 mg/kg bwt) showed peak plasma levels of about 0.15 ?g/ml 1 h after dosing, followed by a slow multi-exponential decline in blood levels of the drug. Total urinary concentrations of hordenine (free and conjugated) peaked at about 200 ?g/ml, remained at this level for about 8 h, and then declined to background levels. Plasma levels of hordenine were reflected by a kinetic model which assumed very slow absorption of hordenine from the gastrointestinal tract and no effect on behaviour, heart rate or respiratory rate were noted after oral administration. Because of the low plasma levels, it would appear to be particularly difficult to obtain a pharmacological effect of hordenine after oral administration.

AB  - summary? This study investigated the shear bond strengths of sectioned human mandibular incisor edge fragments reattached using luting cements, bonding agents or restored with composite resins. Seventy teeth were randomly distributed among six experimental groups and a control group. Leaving half of the anatomic crowns exposed, the teeth were embedded in self-cure acrylic resins with the exposed part then sectioned. The fragments in groups 1?4 were bonded to their respective teeth using Clearfil Liner Bond 2V, Scotch Bond Multi Purpose Plus, Panavia-F and 3M Opal Luting cement. The 5th and 6th groups were restored with composite resins (Silux 3M and Clearfil AP-X) using their bonding agents (Single Bond and Clearfil SE Bond). The results indicated that reattachment of fractured incisal fragments by using new generation bonding agents was effective against shear stresses, comparable with the intact teeth. Instead of restoration with composite resins therefore reattachment of a fractured fragment might be more preferable in cases of dental trauma.

AB  - Abstract Osteomyelitis often causes functional impairment due to tissue destruction. This report demonstrates a novel previously unappreciated role of osteoblasts. Samples of osteomyelitic bone and bacterially challenged osteoblasts produce increased amounts of antimicrobial peptides in order to combat bacterial bone infection. An osteomyelitis mouse model confirmed the osseous induction of the murine homologue of human ?-defensin-2, suggesting a central role in the prevention of bacterial bone infection. Antimicrobial peptides are effectors of the innate defence system and play a key role in host protection at cellular surfaces. Some of them are produced constitutively, whereas others are induced during infection. Human ?-defensins represent a major subclass of antimicrobial peptides and act as a first line of defence through their broad spectrum of potent antimicrobial activity. The aim of the present in-vitro and in-vivo investigations was to study the expression and regulation of human ?-defensin-2 in the case of bacterial bone infection and to analyse the effects of immunosuppressive drugs on bone-derived antimicrobial peptide expression. Samples of healthy human bone, osteomyelitic bone and cultured osteoblasts (hFOB cells) were assessed for the expression of human ?-defensin-2. Regulation of human ?-defensin-2 was studied in hFOB cells after exposure to bacterial supernatants, proinflammatory cytokines and immunosuppressive drugs (glucocorticoids and methotrexate) and was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. An osteomyelitis mouse model was performed to demonstrate the regulation of the murine homologue of human ?-defensin-2, named murine ?-defensin-3, by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Healthy human bone and cultured osteoblasts are able to produce human ?-defensin-2 under standard conditions. Samples of infected bone produce higher levels of endogenous antibiotics, such as human ?-defensin-2, when compared with samples of healthy bone. A clear induction of human ?-defensin-2 was observed after exposure of cultured osteoblasts to Gram-positive bacteria or proinflammatory cytokines. Additional treatment with glucocorticoids or methotrexate prevented bacteria-mediated antimicrobial peptide induction in cultured osteoblasts. The osteomyelitis mouse model demonstrated transcriptional upregulation of the murine homologue of human ?-defensin-2, namely murine ?-defensin-3, in bone after intraosseous contamination of the tibia. Human and murine bone have the ability to produce broad-spectrum endogenous antibiotics when challenged by micro-organisms in vitro and in vivo. Immunosuppressive drugs, such as glucocorticoids or methotrexate, may increase the susceptibility to bone infection by decreasing antimicrobial peptide expression levels in case of microbial challenge. The induction of human ?-defensin-2 following bacterial contact suggests a central role of antimicrobial peptides in the prevention of bacterial bone infection.

AB  - Abstract L1 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules that is associated with axonal growth, including formation of the corticospinal tract (CST). The present study describes the effects of L1 deletion on hindlimb function in locomotion, and examines the role of L1 in recovery and remodeling after contusive spinal cord injury (SCI) in mice. Uninjured adult L1 knockout (Y/?) mice had impaired performance on locomotor tests compared with their wild-type littermates (Y/+). Anterograde tracing demonstrated that CST axons project to thoracic, but not lumbar, levels of the spinal cord of Y/? mice, and revealed a diversion of these fibers from their position in the base of the dorsal columns. Retrograde tracing also revealed reduced numbers of descending projections from paraventricular hypothalamus and red nuclei to the lumbar spinal cord in Y/? mice. SCI at the mid-thoracic level produced a lesion encompassing the center of the spinal cord, including the site of the dorsal CST and surrounding gray matter (GM). The injury caused lasting deficits in fine aspects of locomotion. There was no effect of genotype on final lesion size or the growth of axons into the lesion area. However, injured Y/? mice demonstrated a robust expansion of CST projections throughout the GM of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord rostral to the lesion compared with Y/+ littermates. Thus, L1 is important for the development of multiple spinal projections and also contributes to the restriction of CST sprouting rostral to the site of a SCI in adults.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent an ideal source of autologous cell-based therapy for chronic wounds. Functional characteristics of MSCs may benefit wound healing by exerting their multi-regenerative potential. However, cell ageing resulting from chronic degenerative diseases or donor age could cause inevitable effects on the regenerative abilities of MSCs. A variety of studies have shown the relationship between MSC ageing and age-related dysfunction, but few associate these age-related impacts on MSCs with their ability of repairing chronic wounds, which are common in the elderly population. Here, we discuss the age-associated changes of MSCs and describe the potential impacts on MSC-based therapy for chronic wounds. Furthermore, critical evaluation of the current literatures is necessary for understanding the underlying mechanisms of MSC ageing and raising the corresponding concerns on considering their possible use for chronic wound repair.

AB  - Abstract The success of implantation of materials into bone is governed by effective osseointegration, requiring biocompatibility of the material and the attachment and differentiation of osteoblastic cells. To enhance cellular function in response to the implant surface, micro- and nano-scale topography have been suggested as essential. In this study, we present bone implants based on 3D?printed titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V), with a unique dual topography composed of micron-sized spherical particles and vertically aligned titania nanotubes. The implants were prepared by combination of 3D?printing and anodization processes, which are scalable, simple and cost-effective. The osseointegration properties of fabricated implants, examined using human osteoblasts, showed enhanced adhesion of osteoblasts compared with titanium materials commonly used as orthopaedic implants. Gene expression studies at early (day 7) and late (day 21) stages of culture were consistent with the Ti substrates inducing an osteoblast phenotype conducive to effective osseointegration. These implants with the unique combination of micro- and nano-scale topography are proposed as the new generation of multi-functional bone implants, suitable for addressing many orthopaedic challenges, including implant rejection, poor osseointegration, inflammation, drug delivery and bone healing.

AB  - Abstract Alterations of blood rheology (hemorheology) are important for the early diagnosis, prognosis, and prevention of many diseases, including myocardial infarction, stroke, sickle cell anemia, thromboembolism, trauma, inflammation, and malignancy. However, real-time in vivo assessment of multiple hemorheological parameters over long periods of time has not been reported. Here, we review the capabilities of label-free photoacoustic (PA) and photothermal (PT) flow cytometry for dynamic monitoring of hemorhelogical parameters in vivo which we refer to as photoacoustic and photothermal blood rheology. Using phenomenological models, we analyze correlations between both PT and PA signal characteristics in the dynamic modes and following determinants of blood rheology: red blood cell (RBC) aggregation, deformability, shape (e.g., as in sickle cells), intracellular hemoglobin distribution, individual cell velocity, hematocrit, and likely shear rate. We present ex vivo and in vivo experimental verifications involving high-speed PT imaging of RBCs, identification of sickle cells in a mouse model of human sickle cell disease and in vivo monitoring of complex hemorheological changes (e.g., RBC deformability, hematocrit and RBC aggregation). The multi-parameter platform that integrates PT, PA, and conventional optical techniques has potential for translation to clinical applications using safe, portable, laser-based medical devices for point-of-care screening of disease progression and therapy efficiency. ? 2011 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry
