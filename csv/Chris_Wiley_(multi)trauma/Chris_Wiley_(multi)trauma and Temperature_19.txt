AB  - Abstract High mortality rates have been reported for methadone in both adults and children. We aimed to determine the pattern of toxicity, possible underlying diseases and treatment challenges in patients referred to our centre with early diagnosis of methadone toxicity and who later died. Medical files of all methadone-poisoned patients who had been admitted to a referral centre of toxicology between March 2011 and March 2016, died during the hospital stay and sent for autopsy to Legal Medicine Organization were retrospectively evaluated. In a total of 94 patients, autopsy findings and laboratory evaluations showed that cause of death was pure methadone toxicity in 57 (60.6%). Other causes of death were ischaemic heart disease in ten, co-ingestions (toxicities including methadone) in eight, brain haemorrhage, multi-organ failure and pneumosepsis (each in four), meningitis/encephalitis in three and head trauma and other toxicities (other than methadone but including an opioid, each in two) patients. Time of cardiopulmonary arrest was significantly different between those with pure methadone toxicity and those who died due to other causes (p = 0.01). Patients who had died due to co-ingestions and other toxicities were younger (p = 0.029) and took more bolus doses of naloxone (p = 0.042). In methadone users, especially in older ages and those with trivial response to naloxone administration, loss of consciousness should not be strictly attributed to methadone toxicity. In such patients, thorough evaluation for other possible causes of loss of consciousness is mandatory.

AB  - This report describes a case of severe spontaneous tension pneumopericardium with concurrent pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax and retropneumoperitoneum in a cat presenting with dyspnoea and signs of cardiac tamponade secondary to metastatic pulmonary carcinoma. Spontaneous pneumopericardium is an extremely uncommon condition consisting of pericardial gas in the absence of iatrogenic/traumatic causes. In humans, it has been described secondary to pneumonia or lung abscess and very rarely secondary to pulmonary neoplasia.

AB  - Application of 100 mmol/L methyl jasmonate (MJ) to the intact bark of 30-yr-old Norway spruce induced anatomical reactions related to defense. Within 30 d, a single MJ treatment induced swelling of existing polyphenolic parenchyma cells (PP cells) and an increase in their phenolic contents and formation of additional PP cells and of traumatic resin ducts (TDs) at the cambial zone. These changes occurred up to 7 cm away from the application zone. Treatment enhanced resin flow and increased resistance to the blue-stain fungus, Ceratocystis polonica. Methyl jasmonate application to the oldest internode of 2-yr-old saplings also induced TD formation, and, more surprisingly, TDs were formed in the untreated internode. Traumatic ducts were not formed in branches, ruling out an effect of volatile MJ on the upper internode. Methyl jasmonate application never gave rise to a hypersensitive response, cell death, tissue necrosis, or wound periderm, indicating the amount of MJ transported across the periderm was very low relative to the application concentration. This is the first report of a single compound giving rise to major cellular features related to acquired resistance and previously shown to be induced by wounding, fungal infection, and bark beetles in Norway spruce.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report intraoperative and major postoperative complications in dogs treated surgically for epiglottic retroversion (ER), compare the incidence of major postoperative complications between procedures, and report survival of surgically treated dogs. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study. Sample population Fifty dogs treated with 78 procedures. Methods Medical records of dogs diagnosed and surgically treated for ER from 2003 to 2017 at 11 institutions were reviewed. Complications were divided into intraoperative and major postoperative complications. Results Intraoperative complications occurred during 2 of 78 (2.6%) procedures. Thirty-six major postoperative complications were documented in 22 dogs after 36 of 74 (48.7%) procedures. Postoperative complications occurred after 7 of 12 (58.3%) nonincisional epiglottopexy, 23 of 43 (53.5%) incisional epiglottopexy, 2 of 4 (50%) partial epiglottectomy, 2 of 12 (16.7%) subtotal epiglottectomy, and 2 of 3 (66.7%) other surgical procedures. Epiglottopexy failure was the most common major postoperative complication. The incidence of major postoperative complications did not differ between procedures (P = .1239), although, when combined, epiglottopexy procedures (30/55) had a higher incidence of complications than epiglottectomy procedures (4/16; P = .048). Thirty (60%) dogs were alive at a median of 928 days (range, 114-2805), 8 (16%) were lost to follow-up after 411 days (range, 43-1158), and 12 (24%) were dead/euthanized after 301.5 days (range, 3-1212). Median survival time was not reached after a median of 716 days. Conclusion Although intraoperative complications were uncommon, major postoperative complications were common, especially after epiglottopexy procedures. Clinical significance Although surgical treatment of ER is associated with a high rate of major postoperative complications, especially epiglottopexy procedures, long-term survival can be achieved.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Guidelines for the rational use of antimicrobials enable practitioners to improve antimicrobial stewardship and slow the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) [1]; these must be regionally relevant [2]. New Zealand (NZ) is geographically isolated and the importance of AMR on equine studs is unknown. Objectives To identify AMR patterns of bacteria isolated from NZ foals so as to provide regionally specific information for the development of antimicrobial stewardship guidelines. Study design Retrospective study of clinical pathology records. Methods A database search of bacterial culture submissions from foals <3 weeks of age from April 2004 to December 2013 was completed. Culture results, antimicrobial sensitivities, and demographic factors were tabulated. The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion susceptibility test was used to define sensitivity. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) was defined as non-sensitivity to 3 or more core antimicrobials in a panel (ceftiofur, enrofloxaxin, gentamicin, penicillin [not included for Gram-negative bacteria], tetracycline, trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole). Results Bacterial isolates (n?=?127) were cultured from 64/102 (62.7%) of foal submissions. Four bacterial groups (Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli) accounted for 100 (79%) of bacterial isolates cultured. At least one or 2 MDR isolates were cultured from 24 (38%) and 8 (12%) foals, respectively. Culture positive and negative foals were demographically similar. Conclusions A significant number of bacterial isolates from foals have reduced antimicrobial susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial drugs. The results are of concern from treatment and stewardship perspectives. Multi-drug resistance was found, indicating a need for regionally relevant antimicrobial use recommendations.

AB  - Abstract Burn injuries and associated complications present a major public health challenge. Many burn patients develop clinically intractable complications, including pain and other sensory disorders. Recent evidence has shown that dendritic spine neuropathology in spinal cord sensory and motor neurons accompanies central nervous system (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS) trauma and disease. However, no research has investigated similar dendritic spine neuropathologies following a cutaneous thermal burn injury. In this retrospective investigation, we analyzed dendritic spine morphology and localization in alpha-motor neurons innervating a burn-injured area of the body (hind paw). To identify a molecular regulator of these dendritic spine changes, we further profiled motor neuron dendritic spines in adult mice treated with romidepsin, a clinically approved Pak1-inhibitor, or vehicle control at two postburn time points: Day 6 immediately after treatment, or Day 10 following drug withdrawal. In control treated mice, we observed an overall increase in dendritic spine density, including structurally mature spines with mushroom-shaped morphology. Pak1-inhibitor treatment reduced injury-induced changes to similar levels observed in animals without burn injury. The effectiveness of the Pak1-inhibitor was durable, since normalized dendritic spine profiles remained as long as 4 days despite drug withdrawal. This study is the first report of evidence demonstrating that a second-degree burn injury significantly affects motor neuron structure within the spinal cord. Furthermore, our results support the opportunity to study dendritic spine dysgenesis as a novel avenue to clarify the complexities of neurological disease following traumatic injury.

AB  - Abstract Background: Ultrastructural findings of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) include myocyte atrophy and myofilament loss, yet little is known about the vascular abnormalities present in IDCM. Methods and results: Patients with IDCM and controls underwent multi-slice CT to examine length and diameter of epicardial vasculature. The levels of mobilizing cytokines and circulating EPCs were assessed by endothelial colony formation assay and flow cytometry. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to examine microvessel density and expression of HIF-1α and ?-catenin. Main epicardial coronary arteries were shorter and smaller, and microvascular density was reduced in the epicardium in IDCM. Epicardial vessel paucity was associated with increased numbers of HIF-1α+ cells (46.8±13.1% vs. 19.4±9.4%, p=0.006) indicating local epicardial hypoxia and elevation of circulating VEGF-A (394pg/mL vs. 22pg/mL, p=0.001). The number of mobilized progenitors CD133+/VEGF-R2+ was 21-fold higher in IDCM compared with controls (6.5±3.3% vs. 0.3±0.2%; p<0.001). Moreover, this defective vascularization was associated with reduced myocardial expression of vascular ?-catenin, an important angiogenic regulator. Conclusions: This study shows defective vascularization and impaired vasculogenesis (the de novo vascular organization of mobilized endothelial progenitors) and angiogenesis (by which new blood vessels are formed from pre-existing mature endothelial cells) in human IDCM.

AB  - Objective Evaluate the effect of a perioperative intravenous continuous rate infusion (CRI) of metoclopramide on the incidence of aspiration pneumonia in the short term postoperative period in dogs undergoing unilateral arytenoid lateralization. Study Design Prospective, randomized, multi-center clinical trial. Animals 61 client-owned dogs with idiopathic laryngeal paralysis and normal preoperative thoracic radiographs. Methods All dogs underwent unilateral arytenoid lateralization with a uniform anesthetic, analgesic, and management protocol. Dogs in the treatment group received an intravenous CRI of metoclopramide for 24 hours perioperative. All dogs were assessed for clinical signs of aspiration pneumonia based on the results of physical examination and owner interview up to the point of suture removal (10?14 days postoperative). Any dog with suspected aspiration pneumonia had thoracic radiographs performed. Results Six dogs developed aspiration pneumonia in the short term postoperative period (2/28 control dogs and 4/33 treated dogs), accounting for an overall frequency of 10% with no significant difference between control and treated dogs. No variables measured in the study were significantly different between control and treated dogs. Conclusions Perioperative metoclopramide, at the doses used in this study, did not affect the incidence of aspiration pneumonia in the short term postoperative period in dogs with idiopathic laryngeal paralysis undergoing unilateral arytenoid lateralization.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the outcome and owner satisfaction after planectomy for nasal planum neoplasia with cosmetic reconstruction with bilateral labial mucocutaneous rotation flaps in dogs. Study design Multi-institutional, retrospective case series. Animals Twenty-six client-owned dogs. Methods Medical records were searched for dogs that had undergone the procedure. Signalment, diagnosis, surgery, complications, requirement for revision surgery, recurrence, and survival information were recorded. Owners were contacted by telephone about their dog's quality of life after the procedure and their satisfaction with their dog's outcome. Results Twenty-five dogs underwent radical planectomy, and 1 dog underwent resection of the nasal planum. Twenty-four dogs had a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, 1 had a diagnosis of atypical adenocarcinoma, and 1 had a diagnosis of a mast cell tumor. Complications occurred in 19 (73%) dogs, with 9 dogs requiring revision surgery; 1 dog not surviving to discharge. Median survival time was 1542 days (range, 3-2010). Recurrence of the primary tumor was suspected in 2 (7.7%) dogs, both with narrow or incomplete excision. Among 11 owners interviewed, 10 were satisfied with their dog's appearance, and 8 reported they would consent to the procedure again. Conclusion Dehiscence was common after this procedure, but local tumor control and survival times were excellent. Owner satisfaction was high, although preoperative client education is vital. Clinical significance This technique should be considered as a viable option for dogs with nasal planum neoplasia given the high rate of recurrence with less aggressive treatment. Complications common following surgery, but do not persist long term and survival times were excellent.

AB  - Thermal trauma causes tissue damage by membrane destabilization and energy depletion at the cellular level, resulting in tissue necrosis and inflammation leading to delayed cell death. One therapeutic approach is to block the immediate triggering of the inflammatory cascade that results in prolonged hypermetabolic responses and immune dysfunction while promoting the expression of growth factors. In the present study, we determined hepatic gene expression responses to insulin-like growth factors-i (IGF-I) gene transfer to burned rats using high-density DNA microarray assays. The expression of 123 out of ~8,800 genes assyed (1.4% of total) were significantly altered. Of these, 42 genes were altered irrespective of treatment by burn trauma (p < 0.05). Changes in gene expression were confirmed by measuring mRNA levels using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein levels by Western blot assays. DNA microarray analyses showed two major mechanisms that mediated beneficial outcomes after IGF-I gene transfer in the burned rat livers. These mechanisms were the stimulation of IGF binding protein potentiation of peripheral IGF-I and the inhibition of the burn-augmented pro-apoptotic and oxidative mitochondrial metabolites stimulated by thermal trauma.

AB  - SUMMARY When IAT is used, the patient's shed blood is collected continuously from the wound site during surgery. The salvaged red cells are stored in a dedicated reservoir and subsequently processed by cell separation (continuous centrifugation), washed with saline, concentrated and retransfused to the patient. In the context of perioperative blood saving strategies, IAT has gained standard-of-care status in many surgical procedures as it is especially cost-effective when the anticipated intraoperative blood loss is likely to exceed 1000 mL (major orthopedic, cardiac, vascular and emergency trauma surgery). IAT is not primarily recommended for cancer surgery or whenever the operative field is contaminated. Intraoperative plasmapheresis (IP) is used in cardiac surgery to minimize coagulation deficiencies caused by the traumatizing effects of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on platelets. A substantial amount of the patient's circulating platelets is withdrawn prior to heparinization and initiation of CPB. The collected autologous platelet-rich plasma is then stored at room temperature, preserving platelet function and plasmatic coagulation factors, and retransfused to the patient after heparin reversal. There is controversy about the actual blood saving benefit of IP, but this method may be effective in complicated procedures precipitating high blood loss and long CPB times. In addition, IP may be used when other autologous whole blood harvesting techniques are not an option.

AB  - Background: Repeated hypoxia and surgical trauma trigger a potent neuroendocrine response and their association is thought to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of multi-organ dysfunction. We investigated the cardiovascular and metabolic responses to repeated acute hypoxia in anaesthetised and surgically instrumented pigs. Methods: Under ketamine-midazolam anaesthesia, 15 pigs were surgically instrumented for measurements of cardiac output, vascular pressures and organ blood flows. Lactate production and O2 uptake were determined in the brain, liver, kidney and intestine. Ten animals were subjected to two 12-min periods of ventilatory hypoxia (FIO2=7%) followed by re-oxygenation and 5 animals underwent 120?min normoxic ventilation (Control group). Results: Both hypoxic challenges produced a comparable release of catecholamines that was associated with increased cardiac output and redistribution of blood flow away from the intestinal and renal areas towards the brain and the liver; O2 uptake was markedly reduced in the intestine (? 56 ± 10%, P < 0.05) and least affected in the brain and the kidney (? 19±12% and ? 23±21%, respectively). During the second hypoxic test, lethal cardiovascular depression occurred in 5 animals; these non-survivors demonstrated impaired hyperdynamic response and incomplete recovery of intestinal O2 uptake during the first hypoxia/reoxygenation test. In the Control group, normoxic ventilation was not associated with significant haemodynamic and metabolic changes. Conclusion: Intraoperative hypoxia causes marked heterogeneity in organ blood flow and metabolism. The inability to develop a hyperdynamic cardiovascular response during a first hypoxic event, as well as a persistent intestinal O2 debt following re-oxygenation, predict the occurrence of death during the second hypoxic insult.

AB  - Polymicrobial sepsis is associated with immunosuppression caused by the predominance of anti-inflammatory mediators and profound loss of lymphocytes through apoptosis. Dendritic cells (DC) are potent antigen-presenting cells and play a key role in T cell activation. We tested the hypothesis that DC are involved in sepsis-mediated immunosuppression in a mouse cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model, which resembles human polymicrobial sepsis. At different time-points after CLP, DC from the spleen and peripheral lymph nodes were characterized in terms of expression of costimulatory molecules, cytokine synthesis, and subset composition. Splenic DC strongly up-regulated CD86 and CD40 but not CD80 as soon as 8 h after CLP. In contrast, lymph node DC equally increased the expression of CD86, CD40, and CD80. However, this process of maturation occurred later in the lymph nodes than in the spleen. Splenic DC from septic mice were unable to secrete interleukin (IL)-12, even upon stimulation with CpG or lipopolysaccharide + CD40 ligand, but released high levels of IL-10 in comparison to DC from control mice. Neutralization of endogenous IL-10 could not restore IL-12 secretion by DC of septic mice. In addition, the splenic CD4+CD8? and CD4?CD8+ subpopulations were lost during sepsis, and the remaining DC showed a reduced capacity for allogeneic T cell activation associated with decreased IL-2 synthesis. Thus, during sepsis, splenic DC acquire a state of aberrant responsiveness to bacterial stimuli, and two DC subtypes are selectively lost. These changes in DC behavior might contribute to impaired host response against bacteria during sepsis.

AB  - Abstract Accumulated evidences indicate intestinal lesions play an important role in the pathogenesis of heatstroke. However, the underlying mechanisms by which heat stress causes intestinal barrier dysfunction and bacterial translocation remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) in heat stress-induced intestinal hyper-permeability and bacterial translocation. Intestinal permeability in heat stressed mouse was evaluated by determining plasma endotoxin concentration and urinal lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio with gastric administration of L/M solution. Venous blood, liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph node tissues were collected for bacterial load test. Real time PCR was used to determine ileum PAR1 mRNA expression. In vitro study, permeability was assessed by determining trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in human intestinal Caco-2 cell line. RWJ-58259, a selective antagonist of PAR1, was used both in vivo and in vitro studies. The results showed that heat stress could increase ileum PAR1 mRNA level, urinal L/M ratio, plasma endotoxin concentration and bacterial load in the blood, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. Blocking PAR1 with RWJ-58259 (10?mg/kg) pretreatment could significantly reduce heat stress-induced above changes, but have no role to PAR1 mRNA level. In Caco-2 cells, heat stress-induced high permeability could also be reduced by RWJ-58259 (5?20?µmol/L). In summary, our results demonstrated that PAR1 signaling pathway may play an important role in the heat stress-induced elevation of intestinal permeability, bacterial translocation and the occurrence of endotoxemia.

AB  - Abstract The main function of the intervertebral disc is to transmit and attenuate compressive and torsional forces, and stabilize the intervertebral joint. Unfortunately, the disc may be displaced or damaged due to trauma or disease causing the nucleus to herniate and protrude into the vertebral canal or intervertebral foramen. Pressure on the spinal nerve may cause pain or paralysis in the area of its distribution. At present, the surgical procedures used to alleviate this condition include disc excision, and/or spinal fusion. A more desirable situation would involve removing the nucleus pulposus and part or all of the annulus fibrosis and implanting a suitable biofunctional equivalent. Such a prostheis should attenuate stresses and prevent abnormal stress at adjacent intervertebral joints. Maintenance of normal disc height would prevent impingement of the posterior facet joints and facet joint syndrome. In a previous companion paper (J. Applied Biomat. 5:125?132; 1994), the mechanical behavior of disc prostheses manufactured from fiber reinforced, elastomeric thermoset resins were examined. In order to develop devices which were more practical from a manufacturing standpoint and extremely reproducible, the fiber reinforced thermoset resins were replaced by multi-durometer thermoplastic elastomeric materials. In the present paper, the mechanical properties of thermoplastic multicomponent desings have been investigated. ? 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objective Although laser angioplasty has been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of long, complex coronary arterial atherosclerotic stenoses, there is an associated risk of acute arterial spasm, dissection, and perforation as well as a significant restenosis rate. It has been postulated that the use of lasers emitting at wavelengths designed for radiation absorption by water would decrease local tissue trauma. Study Design/Materials and Methods We have examined the use of a Nd:YAG laser designed to emit at 1.44 ?m, an absorption peak for water, and compared the results of laser ablation at 1.06 ?m, 1.32 ?m, and 1.44 ?m wavelengths. Nd:YAG laser angioplasty was performed in the abdominal aorta of White Leghorn roosters. Acute and chronic vascular trauma was assessed by contrast angiography and histological analysis. Results There was a significant decrease in early mortality with 1.44 ?m laser ablation. This decreased mortality after 1.44 ?m ablation was associated with a decrease in vascular spasm, perforation, and thermal damage. Atherosclerotic plaque development at follow up was decreased with 1.44 ?m ablation but this was not significant. Conclusion 1.44 ?m laser ablation decreases early vascular trauma and mortality and may decrease subsequent atherosclerotic plaque development. ? 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Preparation of thin serial sections for comparative macromorphologic investigations has always represented a grave technical problem, especially in the case of regions in which bone as well as soft tissue are to be documented within their natural relations to each other in any desired sectional plane. Non-decalcified specimens up to the size of a whole cadaver are embedded in physiologic medium, precisely positioned, and deep-frozen to a specimen-ice block. A newly developed device, working on the basis of blades rotating at high speed, allows quick, successive removal of sections from the surface of the specimen block, with a thickness of each section infinitely variable between 0.1 and 5 mm. Following each cut, the new surface of the block can be documented photographically or on videotape for macromorphologic evaluation. So far more than 1,000 human, animal, and botanical specimens have been sectioned and evaluated with this method. In none of the cases were specimens damaged. Furthermore, any desired sectional plane could be adjusted; consequently a definite correlation between these sections and previous sonography, magnetic resonance (MR), or computed tomography (CT) images could be established. As serial cryosectioning becomes available to a far wider circle of medical and natural scientists, high-quality results should be obtained at lower costs. ? 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane for inhalant anesthesia in red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) in terms of the speed and characteristics of induction; cardiovascular and respiratory parameters while anesthetized; and speed and quality of recovery. Study design? Prospective, cross over, randomized experimental study. Animals? 12 healthy adult red-tailed hawks. Methods? Anesthesia was induced with isoflurane, sevoflurane or desflurane in oxygen via face mask in a crossover, randomized design with a 1?week washout period between each treatment. Hawks were tracheally intubated, allowed to breathe spontaneously, and instrumented for cardiopulmonary monitoring. Data collected included heart rate, respiratory rate, end-tidal CO2, inspired and expired agent, SpO2, temperature, systolic blood pressure, time to intubation and time to recovery (tracking). Recovery was subjectively scored on a 4 point scale as well as a summary evaluation, by a single blinded observer. Results? No significant difference in time to induction and time to extubation was noted with the administration of isoflurane, sevoflurane or desflurane. Time to the ability of the bird to follow a moving object with its eyes (tracking) was significantly faster with the administration of sevoflurane and desflurane. All recoveries were scored 1 or 2 and were assessed as good to excellent. No significant difference was noted in heart rate, blood pressure and temperature among the three inhalants. Administration of isoflurane resulted in lower respiratory rates. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Overall, although isoflurane remains the most common inhaled anesthetic in avian practice, sevoflurane and desflurane both offer faster time to tracking, while similar changes in cardiopulmonary function were observed with each agent during anesthesia of healthy red-tailed hawks.

AB  - Summary To consider the hypothesis that autoimmune mechanisms may contribute to the pathology of equine joint diseases, 3 autoimmune responses were assayed in sera and synovial fluids. IgM-rheumatoid factor and antibodies to heat shock protein 65 kDa were determined by ELISA; anti-nuclear antibodies were assayed by indirect immunofluorescence to whole cell nuclear components. All parameters showed only modest increases, if any and not in a pattern related to disease, although some statistically significant increases were detected. Group analysis showed significantly elevated synovial fluid IgM-rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF) in horses with OA (P<0.01), traumatised joints (P<0.01) and articular fractured bones (P<0.001). There was no significantly increased IgM-RF in the sera of horses with joint disorders compared to control horses. Significantly raised anti-heat shock protein molecular weight 65 kDa (HSP65) antibodies were only found in the synovial fluids of the horses with traumatised joints (P<0.001). No correlations were found between the synovial fluid and sera levels of IgM-RF or anti-HSP65 antibodies. Synovial fluid anti-HSP65 antibody and IgM-RF levels positively correlated in the OCD (P<0.001), fracture (P<0.01) and synovitis (P<0.05) groups. As antibodies to HSP65 correlated with IgG concentrations in synovial fluids, it is not possible to draw conclusions on HSP roles in joint disease pathogenesis. No serum anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) were detected by immunofluorescence using rat liver and a human epithelial cell line (HEp-2) as substrates. Compared with autoimmune responses in human and canine arthropathies, the low levels of autoimmune reactivity detected in this study can only suggest a minor contributory role to joint disease pathology in the horse. These results have 2 important implications. Firstly, other pathogenetic mechanisms should be considered and secondly, autoimmune mechanisms cannot be used to monitor disease progress and therefore should not be targetted for treatment.

AB  - Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of cimicoxib (Cimalgex?; Vétoquinol SA) for the control of perioperative pain in dogs. Methods A double-blind, randomized, controlled multi-centre field study was conducted in 237 dogs undergoing orthopaedic or soft tissue surgery. Pain was monitored by the attending veterinarian over the 7 days following the surgical procedure using two pain-scoring systems and a visual analogue scale. An enhanced monitoring protocol for postoperative pain was utilized during the first 24 hours after surgery. The dog owner's assessment of perceived analgesia during this time period was also recorded. Results Cimicoxib demonstrated statistically significant non-inferiority compared to carprofen. These findings were confirmed by owners? assessments and by the evolution of the pain scores. Both drugs were well tolerated throughout the study. Clinical Significance Cimicoxib had non-inferior efficacy and tolerability when compared to carprofen for the control of perioperative pain in dogs undergoing orthopaedic or soft tissue surgery.
