AB  - About 50% of the trauma victims die at the scene mostly because of exsanguinating haemorrhage. Most trials of resuscitation fail in face of the ongoing bleeding. Ongoing research/studies to save these victims by inducing rapid hypothermia using cardiopulmonary bypass as an emergency initial measure along with delayed resuscitation show improved outcomes. A comprehensive review of this research and analysis of studies showed that rapid induction of hypothermia within 5 min of cardiac arrest is associated with better survival and improved neurological outcome. This led us to conclude that suspended animation is a lifesaving modality for the treatment of trauma victims, otherwise hurtling towards certain death. This should be integrated into regular clinical practice. The US Food and Drug Administration has given its approval for clinical trials on such an intervention.

AB  - Aim:? To analyse medical and witness evidence collected during investigations of infant abusive head trauma with a view to (i) isolating cases where a functional time limit could be established and (ii) examining those cases for evidence of the onset of neurological symptoms. Methods:? A retrospective study was undertaken of severe infant abusive head trauma cases investigated by the Queensland Police Service over a 10-year period. In cases where sufficient reliable (non-perpetrator) evidence was available, a functional time limit was documented. Those files were then examined for further medical, witness or perpetrator evidence of the infant victim?s response to the assault. Results:? A functional time limit was established in 16 of 52 cases (31%). In 11 of the 16 cases there was evidence of an immediate neurological response on the part of the victim. Conclusion:? The study suggests that the period between assault and onset of symptoms in infant abusive head trauma is brief, particularly in cases of an acute deterioration where proximate medical intervention is required. In those cases with sufficient evidence of the victim?s condition post-injury, the symptoms presented without delay.

AB  - Abstract A severe microarterial trauma (arteriotomy/intimectomy) was introduced to the central arteries of rabbit ears. Twenty-one patent vessels, 3 at each interval of 2 hours, 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, and 90 days after reperfusion were taken for light and scanning electron microscopy studies. These vessels remained patent at all time intervals. A physiological ?in vivo? perfusion technique with fixation fluid of normal temperature (37°C), pressure (120 mm Hg) and osmolarity (300 mOsm) was used to ensure fixed relaxed vessels. The endothelial, internal elastic, and part of the medial layers of vessel walls were removed following intimectomy. The inner surface of the intimectomy region was irregular and partly covered with thrombotic materials between 2 hours and 3 days postreperfusion. Endothelialization of the traumatized region was first observed at 3 days and was completed between 7 and 14 days. Intimal hyperplasia developed during this period and had not diminished in thickness by 30 or 90 days. The trauma and healing process of the arteriotomy/intimectomy are similar to the healing of vascular anastomoses and virtually identical to the clinical trauma of vessel avulsion, but neointima formation is more pronounced and engages vessel walls far outside the intimectomy site. ? 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The mechanism of secondary damage spread after brain trauma remains unsolved. In this work, we redirected the attention to astrocytic communication pathways. Using an in vitro trauma model that consists of a scratch injury applied to an astrocyte monolayer, we found a significant and transient induction of connexin43 (Cx43) hemichannel activity in regions distal from the injury, which was maximal ?1 h after scratch. Two connexin hemichannel blockers, La3+ and the peptide Gap26, abolished the increased activity, which was also absent in Cx43 KO astrocytes. In addition, the scratch-induced increase of hemichannel activity was prevented by inhibition of P2 purinergic receptors. Changes in hemichannel activity took place with a particular spatial distribution, with cells located at ?17 mm away from the scratch presenting the highest activity (dye uptake). In contrast, the functional state of gap junction channels (dye coupling) was not significantly affected. Cx43 hemichannel activity was also enhanced by the acute extracellular application of 60 mM K+. The increase in hemichannel activity was associated with an increment in apoptotic cells at 24 h after scratch that was totally prevented by Gap26 peptide. These findings suggest that Cx43 hemichannels could be a new approach to prevent or reduce the secondary cell damage of brain trauma. GLIA 2015;63:1185?1199

AB  - Background Prehospital management of the traumatically injured patient has evolved significantly since the organization of emergency medical services across the United States in the 1970s. Initially focusing on the utilization of crystalloid solutions to restore shed blood volume, robust military and civilian trauma experiences led to a modern day shift towards balanced blood component and ultimately whole blood use for immediate volume replacement. In addition, prehospital transfusion or remote damage control resuscitation (RDRC) has been widely adopted. This has led to point of injury resuscitation using blood products both in the United States and abroad. Objectives This article will review the evolution of civilian and military prehospital resuscitation as well as the current practice of prehospital whole blood transfusion in the civilian trauma population in the United States. Additionally, we will provide an overview of our regional trauma system's use of whole blood with focus on the programme infrastructure, donor programme, product rotation schedule and logistical challenges. Finally, we provide three case report examples of the effective use of whole blood in our civilian emergency medical services (EMS) programs.

AB  - Abstract Tidal energy converters (turbines) are being developed in many countries as part of attempts to reduce reliance on hydrocarbon fuels. However, the moving blades of tidal turbines pose potential collision risks for marine animals. Accurate assessment of mortality risk as a result of collisions is essential for risk management during planning and consenting processes for marine energy developments. In the absence of information on the physical consequences of such collisions, predicting likely risks relies on theoretical collision risk models. The application of these at a population level usually assumes that all collisions result in mortality. This is unlikely and the approach therefore produces upwardly biased estimates of population consequences. In this study, we estimate the pathological consequences of direct collisions with tidal turbines using seal carcasses and physical models of tidal turbine blades. We quantify severe trauma at a range of impact speeds and to different areas of seal carcasses. A dose?response model was developed with associated uncertainty to determine an impact speed threshold of severe trauma to use in future collision risk models. Results showed that severe trauma was restricted to the thoracic region, with no evidence of injury to the lumbar or cervical spine. Pathological indicators of mortality were only predicted to occur in collision speeds in excess of 5.1 m/s (95% C.I. 3.2?6.6) and was affected by body condition; increasing blubber depth reduced the likelihood of severe trauma. Synthesis and applications. This study provides important information for policy makers and regulators looking to predict the potential impacts of tidal turbines on marine mammals. We demonstrate that the probability of severe trauma in seals due to collisions with turbine blades is highly dependent upon collision speed, and that the majority of predicted collisions are unlikely to cause fatal skeletal trauma. We recommend that collision risk models incorporate appropriate mortality assumptions to ensure accurate estimates of the population consequences are produced in risk assessments for tidal turbine deployments.

AB  - Abstract Sensorineural hearing loss is often accompanied by difficulties with understanding speech in fluctuating backgrounds, suggesting that neural coding of complex sound features, such as the sound envelope, is impaired. Here, we studied how temporal and rate coding of the envelope is affected in the inferior colliculus immediately after acoustic trauma. Neural activity in response to amplitude-modulated noise was recorded from the inferior colliculus of the guinea pig, before and immediately after a 1-hr 11-kHz acoustic trauma. Units with a characteristic frequency (CF) below the trauma frequency (<11 kHz) showed increased response gains, a measure for temporal coding of the sound envelope, especially at low modulation frequencies (≤128 Hz). Units with a CF > 11 kHz, which had large acoustic trauma-induced threshold shifts, had decreased response gains to amplitude-modulated noise. Shapes of temporal modulation transfer functions shifted toward a higher proportion of low-pass shapes in low-CF units, and to less band-pass shapes in high-CF units. Furthermore, driven firing rates decreased, especially at high modulation frequencies for high-CF units. The observed changes occurred immediately following trauma and were thus a result of the immediate trauma-induced damage to the auditory system. If also present in human subjects, reduced response gains in high-frequency units could disrupt coding of consonants and consequently impair speech understanding in noisy environments. Moreover, the enhanced temporal coding by low-CF units of the low modulation frequencies could overly amplify responses to low-frequency noise, further deteriorating listening in noise.

AB  - SUMMARY Objectives To describe the ?Resuscitation with Pre-HospItaL bLood products? trial (RePHILL) ? a multi-centre randomised controlled trial of pre-hospital blood product (PHBP) administration vs standard care for traumatic haemorrhage. Background PHBP are increasingly used for pre-hospital trauma resuscitation despite a lack of robust evidence demonstrating superiority over crystalloids. Provision of PHBP carries additional logistical and regulatory implications, and requires a sustainable supply of universal blood components. Methods RePHILL is a multi-centre, two-arm, parallel group, open-label, phase III randomised controlled trial currently underway in the UK. Patients attended by a pre-hospital emergency medical team, with traumatic injury and hypotension (systolic blood pressure?<90?mmHg or absent radial pulse) believed to be due to traumatic haemorrhage are eligible. Exclusion criteria include age?<16?years, blood product receipt on scene prior to randomisation, Advanced Medical Directive forbidding blood product administration, pregnancy, isolated head injury and prisoners. A total of 490 patients will be recruited in a 1?: 1 ratio to receive either the intervention (up to two units of red blood cells and two units of lyophilised plasma) or the control (up to four boluses of 250?mL 0.9% saline). The primary outcome measure is a composite of failure to achieve lactate clearance of ≥20%/h over the first 2?hours after randomisation and all-cause mortality between recruitment and discharge from the primary receiving facility to non-acute care. Secondary outcomes include pre-hospital time, coagulation indices, in-hospital transfusion requirements and morbidity. Results Pilot study recruitment began in December 2016. Approval to proceed to the main trial was received in June 2017. Recruitment is expected to continue until 2020. Conclusions RePHILL will provide high-quality evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of PHBP resuscitation for trauma.

AB  - ABSTRACT TRAUMA IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH for people younger than age 45 in the United States. To help prevent death or disability, critically in jured trauma patients must reach definitive care within the ?golden hour.? OFTEN, THE PERIOPERATIVE TEAM has no more than 10 minutes to prepare the room before a patient who has suffered multiple, critical, traumatic injuries is rushed into the OR. FOR THE TRAUMA PATIENT'S SAFETY, the perioperative team must be diligent and use creative measures to efficiently ensure that all surgical counts are completed. Foregoing surgical counts places the trauma patient at an increased risk for unintentionally retained foreign objects.

AB  - Background: Data on the incidence and significance of catheter-induced trauma to fast and slow pathways are scarce. Objectives: To evaluate the incidence, predictors, and clinical implications of inadvertent catheter-induced mechanical trauma to fast and slow pathways during radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT). Methods: A total of 901 consecutive patients (aged 9?92 years old) with inducible sustained AVNRT underwent RFA of the slow pathway. All procedures were closely monitored for appearance of catheter-induced mechanical block of fast or slow pathways. Results: Catheter-induced mechanical trauma to fast and/or slow pathways was observed in 121 (13.4%) patients: 86 (71%) patients had trauma of the fast pathway, three (2.4%) had trauma of the slow pathway, and 32 (26.4%) had trauma of both pathways. Mechanical trauma lasted <1 minute in 87 (72%) patients, 1?30 minutes in 23 (19%) and >30 minutes in 11 (9%). A significantly increased procedure discontinuation rate was observed in patients with mechanical trauma as compared to those with no trauma (P < 0.0001). Young patient age (<35) was a strong predictor for the occurrence of mechanical trauma to AV nodal pathways. No significant difference between the trauma and non-trauma groups was found in respect to the number of catheters used during the procedure, the incidence of AV block, and the need for permanent pacemaker implantation. Conclusions: Mechanical trauma to fast and slow pathways during ablation of AVNRT is more common than previously recognized, occurring especially in patients aged <35 years.

AB  - ABSTRACT Current designs of leg-lengthening implants have faced serious failures due to inadequacies in the mechanical design. The failure typically is the result of fatigue induced by a combined loading condition with axial and shear components acting in the tubular body of the implant. One of the reasons leading to the failure is improper verification testing for the design of the fatigue limit. The current test standards for pre-clinical design phases of nail implants are relatively straightforward and widely accepted yet cannot produce the three-dimensional stress state representative of the anticipated operation in a patient during the consolidation phase. This work introduces a major improvement toward a method for verifying fatigue life of tubular as well as solid implants under combined torque, axial load, and bending. The report describes a new loading fixture, a calibration method, and compares the qualification results of finite element simulation analyses and experimental measurements during cyclic loading tests. The findings state that the fixture produces controlled multi-axial loadings to study varied osteotomy locations, quasi-static strength and fatigue of intramedullary implants at an intermediate, 2?Hz, cycle rate. ? 2019 The Authors.

PY  - 1992
AB  - Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare but well recognized clinical entity which most often occurs on the trunk, perineum or legs following surgery or trauma. The condition is much less common in the head and neck and it is particularly uncommon in the midface/periorbital region. In almost all the cases occurring in the neck the condition follows obvious dental or oropharyngeal sepsis and in all the cases of the scalp there is a history of previous surgery or trauma. However, necrotizing fasciitis of the midface/periorbital region may lack any obvious traumatic aetiology or may follow relatively minor trauma. The diagnosis in these cases may not be suspected and treatment may be delayed with fatal consequences. Treatment by wide excision of all affected skin can lead to disastrous cosmetic consequences in facial disease and it is suggested that disease control can be achieved by raising wide based skin flaps with excision of the underlying necrotic tissue. The flaps are then returned onto normal muscle with much improved cosmetic results. This paper discusses the diagnosis and treatment of patients with necrotizing fasciitis of the face which has arisen without significant trauma.

AB  - Summary Adhesion molecules appear to play a pivotal role in tissue damage secondary to the inflammatory process. Besides neutrophiland endothelial-bound adhesion molecules, soluble forms have been detected in the circulating blood. They seem to be good markers of endothelial damage, but they may also have other biological functions. Plasma concentrations of soluble adhesion molecules (endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecules (sELAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), and granule membrane protein 140 (sGMP-140) were serially measured over 5 days by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in 45 consecutive trauma patients. These received, by random allocation, only either hydroxyethylstarch solution 10% (mean molecular weight 200 000 daltons) (n = 15) or human albumin 20% (n = 15) for volume therapy. Another 15 patients without defined volume therapy received pentoxifylline continuously (1.2mg.kg-1.h-1). Measurements were carried out on the day of admission to the intensive care unit (baseline) and during the next 5 days. At baseline, plasma concentrations of all adhesion molecules were similar in all groups. In the hydroxyethyl starch group, sELAM-1 and sICAM-1 concentrations decreased significantly (p < 0.05) reaching normal values during the study period whereas the mean (SD) values increased in the pentoxifylline group (sELAM-1: 71.1 (16.7) to 91.6 (17.8) ng.ml-1) and the albumin group (sICAM-1: 400 (81) to 749 (101) ng.ml-1) (p < 0.05). sVCAM-1 increased outside the normal range only in the human albumin group (to 760 ± 69 ng.ml-1) (p < 0.05). sGMP-140 plasma concentration increased only in those receiving albumin (432 (85) to 550 (93) ng.ml-1) and this was significantly different to the other groups (p < 0.05). None of the other haemodynamic or laboratory factors could be correlated with plasma concentrations of the adhesion molecules. We conclude that colume therapy with hydroxyethyl starch resulted in a decrease in circulating adhesion molecules in our trauma patients. In contrast, volume therapy with albumin did not exert this effect. Continuous infusion of pentoxifylline did not have a beneficial modulating action on circulating adhesion molecules.

AB  - Summary? In this selective study, 59% of the patients had a renal injury (laceration, rupture or pedicle injury). A normal IVU excluded significant renal injury after blunt trauma. Renal angiography was more accurate than ultrasonography or computed tomography in determining the extent of the injury. A retroperitoneal haematoma found during laparotomy should be explored if significant renal trauma cannot be excluded. Renal salvage after rupture or pedicle injury should be attempted in stable patients.

AB  - Abstract Objective Limited attention has been given to ocular injuries associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The retina is an extension of the central nervous system and evaluation of ocular damage may offer a less-invasive approach to gauge TBI severity and response to treatment. We aim to characterize acute changes in the mouse eye after exposure to two different models of TBI to assess the utility of eye damage as a surrogate to brain injury. Methods A model of blast TBI (bTBI) using a shock tube was compared to a lateral fluid percussion injury model (LFPI) using fluid pressure applied directly to the brain. Whole eyes were collected from mice 3 days post LFPI and 24 days post bTBI and were evaluated histologically using a hematoxylin and eosin stain. Results bTBI mice showed evidence of vitreous detachment in the posterior chamber in addition to vitreous hemorrhage with inflammatory cells. Subretinal hemorrhage, photoreceptor degeneration, and decreased cellularity in the retinal ganglion cell layer was also seen in bTBI mice. In contrast, eyes of LFPI mice showed evidence of anterior uveitis and subcapsular cataracts. Interpretation We demonstrated that variations in the type of TBI can result in drastically different phenotypic changes within the eye. As such, molecular and phenotypic changes in the eye following TBI may provide valuable information regarding the mechanism, severity, and ongoing pathophysiology of brain injury. Because vitreous samples are easily obtained, molecular changes within the eye could be utilized as biomarkers of TBI in human patients.

AB  - ABSTRACT Orthopedic trauma, such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) disruption, is a common source of osteoarthritis in the knee. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive multi-planar imaging modality commonly used to evaluate hard and soft tissues of diarthrodial joints following traumatic injury. The contrast provided by generated images enables the evaluation of bone marrow lesions as well as delamination and degeneration of articular cartilage. We will provide background information about MRI signal generation and decay (T1 and T2 values), the utility of morphologic MRI, and the quantitative MRI techniques of T1?, T2, and T2* mapping, to evaluate subjects with traumatic knee injuries, such as ACL rupture. Additionally, we will provide information regarding the dGEMRIC, sodium, and gagCEST imaging techniques. Finally, the description and utility of newer post hoc analysis techniques, such as texture analysis, will be given. Continued development and refinement of these advanced MRI techniques will facilitate their clinical translation. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract: A pure electroporation injury leads to cell membrane disruption and subsequent osmotic swelling of the tissue. The state of water in the injured area of a tissue is changed and differs from a healthy tissue. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is very sensitive to the quality of the interaction between mobile (water) protons and a restricted (protein) proton pool, is therefore a useful tool to characterize this injury. Here, we present a protocol designed to measure the difference between the values of the transverse magnetic relaxation time (T2) in MRIs of healthy and electrically injured tissue. In addition, we present a method to evaluate the two main contributions to the MRI contrast, the degree of structural alteration of the cellular components (including a major contribution from membrane pores), and edema. The approach is useful in assessing the level of damage that electric shocks produce in muscle tissues, in that edema will resolve in time whereas structural changes require active repair mechanisms.

AB  - Purpose? The incidence of abdominal stab wounds treated at the Royal Melbourne Hospital has noticeably increased over the 12 month period to March 2006, mirroring an increase in penetrating abdominal trauma throughout many Australian trauma centers. Management protocols for abdominal stab wounds are still contentious. The current study quantifies the increase in stab wounds at the Royal Melbourne Hospital over a 24 month period and analyzes the management and investigative modalities utilized. Methodology? A review of the Trauma Unit of the Royal Melbourne Hospital was performed for the period of March 20th 2004 until March 20th 2006. All anterior abdominal stab wounds were collated for the site of injury, investigations performed on admission, results of investigations, operations performed, and findings at operation. Results? There were 4244 emergency trauma presentations over the 24 months period between March 20th 2004 and March 20th 2006. The second 12 month period showed a 21.5% increase in overall trauma admissions and a 91.3% increase in anterior abdominal stabbings. The percentage of stab wounds treated conservatively fell by 21.8%, with the percentage of laparotomies increasing by 14.2%. Almost 30% of all patients undergoing surgery had no visceral injury at operation. Twenty CT scans were performed preoperatively, with a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 100%. Conclusion? Abdominal stab wounds treated at Royal Melbourne Hospital have substantially increased over the past 12 months. Whilst management is still contentious, a management protocol for anterior abdominal stab wounds is proposed, outlining the role of CT scanning, conservative management, laparoscopy and laparotomy

AB  - Background Under predicted climate change scenarios, koala distribution in Australia is expected to be adversely affected. Recent studies have attempted to identify suitable habitat, based on models of bioclimatic regions, but to more accurately reflect the thermal tolerance and behavioural adaptations of the various regional populations, the koala's response to periods of heat stress will need to be investigated at the individual animal level. Objective To explore the safety and suitability of temperature-sensitive intra-abdominal implants for monitoring core body temperature in the koala. Methods A temperature-sensitive radio transmitter and thermal iButton data-logger, waxed together as a package, were surgically implanted into the abdominal cavity of four captive koalas. In one animal the implant was tethered and in the other three, it was left free-floating. Results After 3 months, the implants were removed and all four koalas recovered without complications. The tethering of the package in the one koala resulted in minor inflammation and adhesion, so this practice was subsequently abandoned. The free-floating deployments were complication-free and revealed a diurnal body temperature rhythm, with daily ranges of 0.4?2.8°C. The minimum recorded body temperature was 34.2°C and the maximum was 37.7°C. The difference in the readings obtained from the transmitters and iButtons never exceeded 0.3°C. Conclusions The suitability of the surgical approach was confirmed, from both the animal welfare and data collection points of view.
