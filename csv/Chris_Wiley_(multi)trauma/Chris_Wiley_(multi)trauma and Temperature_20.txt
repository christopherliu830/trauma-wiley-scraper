AB  - Objective? To compare the effects of postoperative pain after ovariohysterectomy by harmonic scalpel-assisted laparoscopy (HALO) and traditional ovariohysterectomy (OVH) in dogs. Study Design? A randomized, blinded, prospective study. Sample Population? Sixteen, purpose-bred, intact female, Beagle dogs. Methods? Dogs were divided into 2 groups: Group 1 (8 dogs), which had OVH by HALO, and Group 2 (8 dogs), which had traditional OVH. Physiologic data, abdominal nociceptive threshold scores, and University of Melbourne pain scores (UMPS) were recorded at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery. Blood samples for measurement of plasma cortisol, glucose, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) concentrations were collected at the time of the incision, and 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery. Results? No significant surgical complications occurred. The HALO mean surgical time was significantly longer (55.7 minutes) than traditional OVH (31.7 minutes). No significant differences were observed between groups for the pain measures of heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, CPK, and glucose concentrations. The OVH group had significantly higher mean plasma cortisol levels at hour 2 after surgery than the HALO group (P=.0001). The mean UMPS were significantly higher in OVH than the HALO group at all postoperative times (P=.0001). The mean nociceptive threshold measurements revealed significantly higher tolerated palpation pressures in HALO than OVH at all postoperative times, except hour 72 (P=.0002). Conclusions? Dogs appeared to be in less pain with HALO than OVH. The harmonic scalpel coagulated ovarian and uterine vessels completely with minimal collateral damage to surrounding tissues. Clinical Relevance? HALO is a safe alternative to OVH and offers a minimally invasive and less painful method of surgery.

AB  - As the number of persons with diabetes increases, there is an increased incidence of foot skin breakdown and lower extremity amputations. Approximately 44%?85% of those amputations can be prevented. Prevention requires an understanding of the causes of diabetic foot skin breakdown and the measures necessary for prevention. As rehabilitation nurses, we care for patients with strokes, hip fractures, spinal cord injuries, or joint replacements, who are diabetic and are at risk for foot skin breakdown. We also care for patients with amputations who are at risk for skin breakdown of the remaining foot. This article identifies the causes of foot skin breakdown, such as neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, trauma, and infection. Discussion includes patients who are at risk, the foot areas at risk, preventive measures, and patient and family education for the prevention of foot skin breakdown in the diabetic patient.

AB  - Abstract Aim To evaluate Save-A-Tooth (SAT), EMT Toothsaver (EMT) and Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) for their influence on the viability and proliferative capacity of human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (HPDLFs). Methodology Primary HPDLFs were seeded into 96-well cell culture plates and exposed to SAT, EMT, HBSS and water (negative control) for 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h at room temperature (22 °C). After each exposure time, cell viability was measured through quantifying adenosine triphosphate (ATP) using a luminescent dye. The proliferative capacity was also quantified using the PrestoBlue assay after 12 or 24 h storage in each medium. The data were analysed statistically by two-way anova and post hoc Least Significant Difference (LSD) test (P < 0.05). The morphology of the cells after 12 h storage was also investigated through live/dead viability/cytotoxicity kit together with fluorescence microscopy. Results There was no significant difference in cell viability amongst HBSS, SAT and EMT groups up to 6 h. SAT was effective in maintaining cell viability only up to 12 h and then became detrimental to HPDLF; after 24 h, the effectiveness of SAT in maintaining cell viability was similar to that of water (P > 0.05). Amongst all the media, only EMT could maintain the proliferative capacity of HPDLFs significantly higher than the negative control, that is water (P < 0.05) after 24 h storage. Conclusion EMT maintained the proliferative capacity of HPDLFs after 24 h storage.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Trauma, emergent tracheostomy, and prolonged intubation are common causes of severe deformation and narrowing of the trachea. Laser technology may be used to reshape tracheal cartilage using minimally invasive methods. The objectives of this study were to determine: (1) the dependence of tracheal cartilage shape change on temperature and laser dosimetry using heated saline bath immersion and laser irradiation, respectively, (2) the effect of temperature on the mechanical behavior of cartilage, and (3) tissue viability as a function of laser dosimetry. Materials and Methods Ex vivo rabbit trachea cartilage specimens were bent and secured around a cylinder (6 mm), and then immersed in a saline bath (45 and 72°C) for 5?100 seconds. In separate experiments, tracheal specimens were irradiated with a diode laser (??=?1.45 µm, 220?400 J/cm2). Mechanical analysis was then used to determine the elastic modulus in tension after irradiation. Fluorescent viability assays combined with laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) were employed to image and identify thermal injury regions. Results Shape change transition zones, between 62 and 66°C in the saline heating bath and above power densities of 350 J/cm2 (peak temperatures 65±10°C) for laser irradiation were identified. Above these zones, the elastic moduli were higher (8.2±4 MPa) than at lower temperatures (4.5±3 MPa). LSCM identified significant loss of viable chondrocytes within the laser-irradiation zones. Conclusion Our results indicate a change in mechanical properties occurs with laser irradiation and further demonstrates that significant thermal damage is concurrent with clinically relevant shape change in the elastic cartilage tissues of the rabbit trachea using the present laser and dosimetry parameters.

AB  - Summary Pulse oximetry as part of the monitoring protocol for anesthetized patients has become the standard of care for veterinary medicine in recent years. Both AAHA and ACVAA have published recommendations for the monitoring of cats and dogs under sedation and/or general anesthesia, to increase patient safety. Oxygenation is a vital parameter to monitor these patients, since sedatives, opioids and inhalant use may compromise ventilation and circulation. Pulse oximeters provide pulse rate and SpO2, a non-invasive, real-time value that correlates to the partial pressure of arterial oxygen via the Oxyhemoglobin Dissociation Curve. Species differences in P50 and pulse rate provide challenges with the use of these monitors across the wide range of animals encountered in veterinary medicine. Numerous models of pulse oximeter are available on the current market, either as standalone units or as part of a combination or multi-parameter monitoring unit. Plethysmography uses waveform analysis that adds valuable information about monitor accuracy and also may detect changes in volume status with the potential to affect patient management with respect to blood volume and fluid resuscitation.

AB  - Abstract The Wildlife Conservation Society's Bronx Zoo has been housing and breeding slender-tailed cloud rats (Phleomys pallidus) since 1985. Records of 82 animals from 1985 to 2013 were reviewed for this study. The animals were kept successfully in small family groups with a single adult male, multiple adult females, and their offspring. Sexual maturity was noted at approximately 2 years of age and gestation length ranged from 52 to 55 days. Animals were fed a diet including a complete commercial pelleted feed, mixed greens, carrot or yam, mixed hard nuts, and locally sourced browse. Medical conditions requiring treatment in neonates were often fatal whereas most medical conditions in adults were survivable. The most common cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates was maternal neglect or trauma (42%, 5/12 antemortem problems; cause of death in 32%, 8/25). The most significant problems in adults were cryptococcal pneumonia and trauma. Cryptococcus sp. was the cause of death in 11 cases (34%, 11/32) and significant comorbidity in an additional three cases. Treatment with antifungal medications was attempted but was unsuccessful in four cases. Many cases of trauma were treated successfully with conservative management or limited intervention. In four cases, treatment was complicated by extensive self-mutilation after surgical repair of traumatic lesions, which resulted in death or euthanasia. Lymphoplasmacytic thyroiditis was a common postmortem finding in adults (95%, 21/22 for which the thyroid gland was examined histologically). It is unclear if thyroiditis resulted in functional hypothyroidism so the significance of this finding is undetermined.

AB  - Objective To determine the risk of bacterial growth in single use 50% dextrose vials punctured multiple times and stored in various hospital environments. Materials and Methods Three groups of three 50% dextrose vials were stored in our hospital intensive care unit at either ambient light or in a darkened drawer at room temperature or refrigerated at 4°C. One vial in each group was punctured either once, once weekly or once daily for 28?days and samples taken for bacterial culture every 7 days until completion of the project. A fourth group of three vials were inoculated with several species of bacteria and stored in our microbiology laboratory under the environmental conditions described above with cultures performed every 7 days for 28?days. In addition, the water activity of 50% dextrose was determined using commercial laboratory equipment. Results Scant growth of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter agglomerans was detected in cultures performed on day 7, but not subsequent time points, from the inoculated refrigerated vials. The vial punctured once daily for 28?days and stored under refrigerated conditions showed growth of Bacillus subtilis on day 28. All remaining bottles had no bacterial growth at any time point or environmental condition. The water activity of 50% dextrose was 093 at 24°C and 092 at 4°C. Clinical Significance Bacterial growth in 50% dextrose vials was uncommon even when inoculated with pathogens. Bacterial growth only occurred in refrigerated storage conditions. The water activity of 50% dextrose is not low enough to inhibit all bacterial and fungal growth.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this study was to compare the sperm morphology and nuclear sperm quality (sperm aneuploidy and DNA fragmentation) in two groups of globozoospermic patients: DPY19L2-mutated patients (n = 6) and SPATA16-mutated patients (n = 2). Results for these two groups were also compared to a group of fertile men (n = 25). Fluorescence in situ hybridisation was performed for chromosomes X, Y and 18. Sperm DNA fragmentation was evaluated by TUNEL assay. Sanger sequencing was performed for mutations screening of DPY19L2 and SPATA16 genes. Sperm analysis revealed a classic phenotype of total globozoospermia in DPY19L2-mutated group and a particular phenotype characterised by a predominance of double/multiple round-headed (39.00 ± 4.2%) and multi-tailed spermatozoa (26.00 ± 16.97%) in SPATA16-mutated group. FISH analysis showed a significantly higher aneuploidy rate in globozoospermic patients compared to controls (p < 0.05), and a higher rate was observed in SPATA16-mutated group compared to DPY19L2-mutated group (p < 0.05). DNA fragmentation index was significantly higher in globozoospermic men compared to controls (p < 0.001), and there is no statistically significant difference between the two globozoospermic groups. We showed that SPATA16 defects could be associated with an abnormal meiosis leading to a particular morphological sperm defect of double/multiple round-headed and multi-flagella and a higher sperm aneuploidy rate than in case of DPY19L2-defects in classic globozoospermia.

AB  - A previous donor intervention trial found that therapeutic hypothermia reduced delayed graft function (DGF) after kidney transplantation. This retrospective cohort study nested in the randomized dopamine trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT000115115) investigates the effects of spontaneous donor hypothermia (core body temperature <36°C) on initial kidney graft function, and evaluates 5-year graft survival. Hypothermia assessed by a singular measurement in the intensive care unit 4-20 hours before procurement was associated with less DGF after kidney transplantation (odds ratio [OR] 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34-0.91). The benefit was greater when need for more than a single posttransplant dialysis session was analyzed (OR 0.48, 95%CI 0.28-0.82). Donor dopamine ameliorated dialysis requirement independently from hypothermia in a temporal relationship with exposure (OR 0.93, 95%CI 0.87-0.98, per hour). A lower core body temperature in the donor was associated with lower serum creatinine levels before procurement, which may reflect lower systemic inflammation and attenuated renal injury from brain death. Despite a considerable effect on DGF, our study failed to demonstrate a graft survival advantage (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95%CI 0.54-1.27), whereas dopamine treatment was associated with improved long-term outcome (HR 0.95, 95%CI 0.91-0.99 per hour).

AB  - Abstract In recent years, autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) derivatives have been used widely in the regeneration and repair of tissue, but a standard definition and preparation method for PRP are lacking. We developed a standardized method using platelet indices as quality-control indicators for PRP preparation. Twenty-one elderly patients (9 males, 12 females) with complex wounds were treated with standardized platelet-rich plasma (S-PRP). The platelet count in PRP after the second centrifugation was 1,069?1,436???109/L. We adjusted the platelet concentration in PRP after a second centrifugation to 1,000???109/L according to a formula using platelet-poor plasma (PPP). The standardized preparation method that we developed gave S-PRP with a relatively uniform platelet concentration. The wounds of 21 patients showed accelerated healing after S-PRP treatment, and there were no obvious side effects during treatment. These data suggest that our preparation method of S-PRP, using platelet indices as quality-control indicators with platelet count of 1,000???109/L could be used for the treatment of complex wounds in the elderly. The preparation method of S-PRP proposed in the present study may be a simple and effective method of PRP quality control.

AB  - Background Admission lactate and lactate clearance are implemented for risk stratification in sepsis and trauma. In out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, results regarding outcome and lactate are conflicting. Methods This is a post-hoc analysis of the Target Temperature Management trial in which 950 unconscious patents after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were randomized to a temperature intervention of 33°C or 36°C. Serial lactate samples during the first 36 hours were collected. Admission lactate, 12-hour lactate, and the clearance of lactate within 12 hours after admission were analyzed and the association with 30-day mortality assessed. Results Samples from 877 patients were analyzed. In univariate logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio for death by day 30 for each mmol/L was 1.12 (1.08-1.16) for admission lactate, P < .01, 1.21 (1.12-1.31) for 12-hour lactate, P < .01, and 1.003 (1.00-1.01) for each percentage point increase in 12-hour lactate clearance, P = .03. Only admission lactate and 12-hour lactate levels remained significant after adjusting for known predictors of outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.65 (0.61-0.69), P < .001, 0.61 (0.57-0.65), P < .001, and 0.53 (0.49-0.57), P = .15 for admission lactate, 12-hour lactate, and 12-hour lactate clearance, respectively. Conclusions Admission lactate and 12-hour lactate values were independently associated with 30-day mortality after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest while 12-hour lactate clearance was not. The clinical value of lactate as the sole predictor of outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is, however, limited.

AB  - Background? The epidemiology of post-injury multiple organ failure (MOF) is reported to go through changes during the last 15 years. The purpose of this study is to describe the epidemiology of post-injury MOF in Australia. Methods? A 12-month prospective epidemiological study was performed in a Major Trauma Service. Demographics, injury severity (ISS), physiological, MOF status and outcome data was prospectively collected on all trauma patients who met inclusion criteria (ICU admission; ISS?>?15; age?>?18, AIS head <3 and survival >48?hrs). MOF was defined by the Denver MOF score. Data are presented as % or Mean+/?SEM. Univariate statistical comparison was performed (Student t- and X-square tests), p?<?0.05 was considered significant. Results? Twenty-five patients met inclusion criteria (Age 39+/?5, ISS 27+/?3, Male 60%), three patients (12%) developed MOF. The maximum MOF score was 5.7 +/?1, with duration of 2.3+/?0.7 days. Two patients had respiratory and cardiac failure, while one patient had failure of respiratory, cardiac, hepatic and renal systems. All MOF patients survived. MOF patients tend to have longer ICU stays (18+/?5.5 vs 7+/?0.8 p?=?0.17), were older (54+/?17 vs 38+/?5 p?=?0.4). None of the previously described independent predictors (ISS, base deficit, lactate, transfusions) were different when the MOF patients were compared with the non-MOF patients. Conclusion? MOF is not as significant a cause of late trauma death as previously reported internationally. Our preliminary data challenges the timeliness of the 10-year-old independent predictors of post-injury MOF. The epidemiology, the clinical presentation and the independent predictors of post-injury MOF requires reassessment for the Australian context.

AB  - 1 Experiments were performed on anaesthetized cats to investigate the receptive properties of regenerated cutaneous tibial nerve nociceptors, and to obtain evidence for coupling between them and other afferent fibres as being possible peripheral mechanisms involved in neuropathic pain. These properties were studied 6-7 months after nerve section and repair. 2 Recordings were made from 25 regenerated nociceptors; 14 were A fibres and the remainder were C fibres. Their receptive field sizes and conduction velocities were similar to controls. There was no significant difference between their mechanical thresholds and those of a control population of nociceptors. 3 Regenerated nociceptors were significantly more responsive to suprathreshold mechanical stimuli than were uninjured control fibres. This increase in mechanical sensitivity occurred in both A and C fibres, although A fibres showed a greater increase in mechano-sensitivity than C fibres. Over half of the regenerated nociceptors (13/25) showed after-discharge to mechanical stimuli which was never seen in controls; the mean firing rate during this period of after-discharge was significantly related to both stimulus intensity and stimulus area. 4 There was no significant difference between the heat encoding properties of regenerated nociceptors and control nociceptors. Cold sensitivity was similarly unchanged. Thus, abnormal peripheral sprouting was unlikely to account for the increased mechanical sensitivity of the regenerated fibres. None of the regenerated nociceptors were found to be coupled to other fibres. 5 These results suggest that the clinical observation of mechanical hyperalgesia in patients after nerve injury may have a peripheral basis. Based on this model, other signs of neuropathic pain (i.e. tactile or thermal allodynia) are more likely to be due to altered central processing.

AB  - Abstract Colloids have been used for many years in resuscitation yet few studies have thoroughly examined their usefulness. Colloids and a combination of crystalloids and colloids continue to be used without any real scientific basis. Scrutiny of review articles, experimental studies, and clinical investigations reveals conflicting and confusing data. There are too many variables to accurately interpret findings, cross species problems with animal studies, different fluids used making comparisons difficult if not impossible, and confounding variables that include: 1 Health status of the patients 2 Severity/type of injury 3 Complications (especially sepsis) 4 Varying grades of shock 5 Variable time scale of administration of fluids 6 Variable volumes administered 7 Differing methods of determining fluid volume depletion 8 Inconsistent monitoring 9 Differing endpoints 10 Different techniques to measure endpoints 11 Comparison of delayed treatment of traumatic shock with blood loss occurring during surgery of questionable validity. One of the areas that has been studied reasonably well is the allergic effects associated with colloid use and more recently the adverse effects associated with the use of dextrose solutions in patients with head injuries. The continued effort to develop satisfactory resuscitation solutions including the recent development of hypertonic saline solutions (usually in combination with a colloid) highlights the uncertainty that exists in relation to the true role of the colloid and crystalloid agents available. Recent studies question the use of fluids to resuscitate patients with penetrating torso injuries. The aim of this paper is to review what is known about the use of colloids and crystalloids in resuscitation and to recommend guidelines as to which fluid should be used in differing clinical situations.

AB  - Abstract Intra-uterine injection of the lectin Concanavalin A (ConA) on day 5 of PSP induced a rapid and persistent infiltration of leucocytes into the rat uterine stroma. Although the infiltration of leucocytes was witnessed along the entire length of the uterine horn, areas of stromal oedema, indicative of decidualisation (as indicated by the positive Pontamine Sky Blue reaction), were only associated with regions in which the movement of leucocytes across the uterine epithelium was evident. Epithelial disruption and trauma was frequently noted within these regions. We believe that ConA may initiate decidualisation through indirectly causing epithelial trauma.

AB  - Objectives To compare thawing times of fresh frozen canine plasma between a 37?°C warm water bath, running water bath and dry plasma thawer and compare haemostatic protein stability after thawing in a warm water bath or dry plasma thawer. Materials and Methods To measure thawing times, a 240-mL bag of frozen plasma was thawed in warm water bath, running water bath or dry plasma thawer-10 times for each method. To evaluate stability of haemostatic proteins, fresh canine donor plasma samples were split into 120-mL bags and 3-mL control aliquots before freezing. Bags were thawed by warm water bath or dry plasma thawer and aliquots equilibrated to room temperature. Concentrations of haemostatic proteins, albumin, D-dimers, prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were obtained. Results The running water bath had the shortest thaw time: median thaw time of 15?minutes versus 18?minutes for both the dry plasma thawer and warm water bath. Statistically significant differences in partial thromboplastin time, factor VII, factor X, von Willebrand factor, and von Willebrand factor collagen binding assay were detected among groups but were unlikely to be clinically relevant. Clinical Significance A traditional running water bath provided the fastest thawing time but the dry plasma thawer resulted in the most stable haemostatic proteins.

AB  - Summary Background The wireless motility capsule concurrently measures temperature, pH and pressure as it traverses the gastrointestinal tract. Aims To describe normative values for motility/contractility parameters across age, gender and testing centres. Methods Healthy participants underwent a standardised wireless motility capsule assessment following an overnight fast and consumption of a meal of known nutritional content. Traces were divided into regions of interest and analysed using 2 software packages (MotiliGI and GIMS Data Viewer). Inter-observer agreement was independently assessed by 2 investigators. Results Normative data for motility/contractility parameters (maximum amplitude, mean peak amplitude, contraction frequency and motility index) are presented for 107 individuals (62 male, median age 40 years, range 18-78). MotiliGI-Gastric, small bowel and colonic maximal contraction amplitude correlated with age (r = .24, P = .01; r = .22, P = .02; and r = .2, P = .04 respectively). Small bowel motility index was higher in females than males (150.4 ± 12 vs 122 ± 7.6, P = .04). Inter-observer agreement was excellent for transit times, pH and contractility/motility parameters. GIMS Data viewer-Gastric, small bowel and colonic loge motility index correlated with the respective area under the contraction curve, total contractions, sum of amplitudes and contraction frequency (all r>.35, P < .0003) but not with transit times. Conclusions Our analysis provides normative data for motility/contractility parameters. Log motility index summarises a number of measures. In future, the measurement of contractile activity with the wireless motility capsule may potentially aid in the diagnosis of disease states such as visceral myopathic disorders.

AB  - Abstract Keypoints The diabetic foot remains an enormous public health problem despite modern advances in foot care. There is a lack of evidence for many diabetic foot interventions: however, there is consensus between experts that a multi-disciplinary spproach helps reduce amputations.
