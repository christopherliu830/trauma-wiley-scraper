AB  - Abstract Isolated pig hearts, subsequently perfused with pig or human blood, were prepared for the cytochemical demonstration of sites of hydrogen peroxide generation and increased vascular permeability. Oxidant stress was associated with ultrastructural changes commonly seen following myocardial reperfusion. In addition, the precipitation of cerium perhydroxide following perfusion with physiological saline containing cerium chloride suggested the vascular endothelium and leukocytes as sources of oxidants. This was associated with rapid penetration of horseradish peroxidase through the intercellular clefts of the vascular endothelium into the interstitial space, suggesting increased vascular leakiness at these sites. The rapid penetration of horseradish peroxidase was observed at all monitored periods of reperfusion with pig or human blood. This indicates that the increased permeability occurred during the ischaemic period and continued during reperfusion. Morphological damage was greatest in pig hearts reperfused with whole human blood and this was attenuated if the blood was preabsorbed to remove antibodies prior to reperfusion. We conclude that oxidant stress was initiated during ischaemia and continued during reperfusion in this model. Microsc. Res. Tech. 42:369?385, 1998. ? 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Several articles have discussed the weaning process for venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; however, there is no published report to outline a standardized approach for weaning a patient from venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This complex process requires an organized approach and a thorough understanding of ventilator management and ECMO physiology. The purpose of this article is to describe the venovenous ECMO weaning protocol used at our institution as well as provide a review of the literature.

AB  - Summary Background The wireless motility capsule concurrently measures temperature, pH and pressure as it traverses the gastrointestinal tract. Aims To describe normative values for motility/contractility parameters across age, gender and testing centres. Methods Healthy participants underwent a standardised wireless motility capsule assessment following an overnight fast and consumption of a meal of known nutritional content. Traces were divided into regions of interest and analysed using 2 software packages (MotiliGI and GIMS Data Viewer). Inter-observer agreement was independently assessed by 2 investigators. Results Normative data for motility/contractility parameters (maximum amplitude, mean peak amplitude, contraction frequency and motility index) are presented for 107 individuals (62 male, median age 40 years, range 18-78). MotiliGI-Gastric, small bowel and colonic maximal contraction amplitude correlated with age (r = .24, P = .01; r = .22, P = .02; and r = .2, P = .04 respectively). Small bowel motility index was higher in females than males (150.4 ± 12 vs 122 ± 7.6, P = .04). Inter-observer agreement was excellent for transit times, pH and contractility/motility parameters. GIMS Data viewer-Gastric, small bowel and colonic loge motility index correlated with the respective area under the contraction curve, total contractions, sum of amplitudes and contraction frequency (all r>.35, P < .0003) but not with transit times. Conclusions Our analysis provides normative data for motility/contractility parameters. Log motility index summarises a number of measures. In future, the measurement of contractile activity with the wireless motility capsule may potentially aid in the diagnosis of disease states such as visceral myopathic disorders.

AB  - Jeanine Yip Menck, Susan Mais Requejo, Kornelia Kulig: Thoracic spine dysfunction in upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type 1. (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA) J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2000;30:401?409. The objective of this case study was to demonstrate the importance of assessment and treatment of the thoracic spine in the management of a patient with signs and symptoms of upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I. The patient was a 38-year-old woman who suffered a traumatic injury to her left hand. Five months after the injury, she presented with severe pain, immobility of the left arm, and associated dystrophic changes. She was unable to work and needed help in some activities of daily living. The patient was treated for 3 months in 36 visits. Initial treatment consisted of cutaneous desensitization, edema management, and gentle therapeutic exercises. However, further examination indicated hypomobility and hypersensitivity of the upper thoracic spine. Joint manipulation of the T3 and T4 segments was implemented. The patient's status was monitored. Immediately after the vertebral manipulation, there was significant increase in the left hand's skin temperature and a decrease in hyperhydrosis as measured by palpation. Shoulder range of motion increased from 135º to 175° and the patient reported reduced pain. The decrease in the patient's dystrophic and allodynic symptoms permitted further progress in functional reeducation. The patient was discharged with full return to independence and initiation of a vocational training program. Conclude that the assessment and treatment of the thoracic spine should be considered in patients with upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I. Comment by Karen Crawford, RPT. This is a study demonstrating the importance of assessment of the thoracic spine to manage patients with signs and symptoms of upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I). The patient was a 38-year-old female with traumatic injury to the left hand. The purpose of this study is to determine the relation between distal symptoms of CRPS-I and the thoracic spine and to describe the use of thoracic spine manipulation in the management of patients with CRPS-I in the upper extremity. CRPS-I in the upper extremity often exhibits postural deviations associated with protective positioning of the arm. It emanates as trunk motion during upper activities and may present with decreased thoracic intervertebral mobility. This study believes that the evaluation and treatment in areas proximal to a patient's symptoms in CRPS-I may be necessary. Hypomobility secondary to abnormal posturing and anatomical proximity of the sympathetic ganglions to the thoracic spine may contribute to the link between upper quadrant CRPS-I and thoracic joint dysfunction. In the study, a 38-year-old, left-hand dominant, female who sustained trauma to her left wrist and hand while at work was seen in physical therapy for a total of 36 visits. Initial treatment consisted of desensitization, edema management, and general therapeutic exercises. Further examination indicated hypomobility and hypersensitivity of the upper thoracic spine. At that time, joint manipulation of T3 and T4 segments was implemented. The patient's status was monitored and range of motion, strength, temperature, and skin moisture were measured. The patient reported minimal changes in her status, and 1 month into treatments, she hit her left hand on a door and consequently discontinued therapy because of increased pain. Five months after the initial injury, patient was reevaluated. She then received physical therapy 3 times per week for 12 weeks and was discharged with significant improved functional status. At the initial examination, the diagnosis of CRPS-I was based on the IASP Committee on Taxonomy. The initial treatment objective was pain management and edema control. The long-term goal was return to a functional status. Initial treatment consisted of gentle active and passive wrist and finger range of motion and tubagrip for edema management. A home program desensitization was implemented. The patient's active participation in therapy was limited secondary to her willingness to move her left arm. Treatment 2 included evaluation and manipulation of the upper thoracic spine. Her clinician used her manipulating hand as a fulcrum by placing it under the supine patient at the level of thoracic joint dysfunction. A thrust was delivered through the patient's folded arms as she exhaled and there as an audible click. There was an immediate normalization of skin temperature, color, as well as significantly decreased allodynic response to light touch along the left arm and the left upper thoracic vertebral column. Segmental thoracic mobility was immediately improved and there was immediate increase in shoulder flexion after this treatment. This reduction of signs and symptoms of CRPS-I made it possible to proceed with functional rehabilitation. Manipulation of the thoracic spine may have resulted in improvements in distal upper extremity pain, skin color, and temperature in a patient with CRPS-I. One explanation is that disuse of the arm and abnormal posturing may contribute to thoracic hypomobility. The anatomic proximity of the sympathetic chain to the dysfunctional thoracic joints may predispose the ganglions to mechanical pressure. Therefore, it is concluded that the evaluation and treatment of areas proximal to the patient's symptoms are necessary. It is difficult to identify the mechanism responsible for changing distal symptoms after thoracic manipulation. The immediate increase in shoulder flexion after manipulation is likely due to mechanical change in the tissue. In conclusion, this study describes a link between the thoracic spine and distal symptoms in patients with CRPS-I. Thoracic joint manipulation appeared to improve spinal mobility, and also appeared to relieve distal and autonomic symptoms. These improvements allowed for functional rehabilitation of the effected arm. Therefore, it is the opinion of the study that the mobility of the thoracic spine should be evaluated for patients with autonomic dysfunction diagnosed with CRPS-I. The research also indicates a need for further research to define the relationship between neurogenic symptoms and musculoskeletal pathology.

AB  - Abstract The incidence of chronic wounds is increased among older adults, and the impact of chronic wounds on quality of life is particularly profound in this population. It is well established that wound healing slows with age. However, the basic biology underlying chronic wounds and the influence of age-associated changes on wound healing are poorly understood. Most studies have used in vitro approaches and various animal models, but observed changes translate poorly to human healing conditions. The impact of age and accompanying multi-morbidity on the effectiveness of existing and emerging treatment approaches for chronic wounds is also unknown, and older adults tend to be excluded from randomized clinical trials. Poorly defined outcomes and variables, lack of standardization in data collection, and variations in the definition, measurement, and treatment of wounds also hamper clinical studies. The Association of Specialty Professors, in conjunction with the National Institute on Aging and the Wound Healing Society, held a workshop, summarized in this paper, to explore the current state of knowledge and research challenges, engage investigators across disciplines, and identify key research questions to guide future study of age-associated changes in chronic wound healing.

AB  - The popularity of recreational activities in the mountains worldwide has led to an increase in the total number of persons exposed to cold and extreme environments through recreation. There is little conclusive evidence about the risk of hypothermia for specific activities or populations, nor is it clear which activities are represented in the literature. This is a non-systematic review of accidental hypothermia in different recreational activities in the mountains, with a specific focus on outdoor or winter activities that potentially involve cold exposure. Cases of hypothermia have been reported in the literature in mountaineering, trekking, hiking, skiing, activities performed in the backcountry, ultra-endurance events, and databases from search and rescue services that include various types of recreation. Of these activities, hypothermia as a primary illness occurs most commonly during mountaineering in the highest elevation areas in the world and during recreation practiced in more northern or remote areas. Hypothermia in skiers, snowboarders, and glacier-based activities is most often associated with accidents occurring off-piste or in the backcountry (crevasse, avalanche). Organizers of outdoor events also have a role in reducing the incidence of hypothermia through medical screening and other preparedness measures. More complete collection and reporting of data on mild hypothermia and temperature measurement would improve our understanding of the incidence of hypothermia in outdoor recreation in future.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report perioperative characteristics, complications, histopathologic diagnosis and outcome in cats undergoing surgical treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Study design Multi-institutional, retrospective case series. Animals Thirty-two client-owned cats. Methods Medical records of cats treated with surgical removal of 1 or more parathyroid gland(s) with confirmed histopathologic evaluation were reviewed. Cats were divided into preoperative ionized calcium (iCa) groups corresponding to the 33rd, 67th, and 100th percentiles of the preoperative iCa results of the study population. Follow-up consisted of phone conversation with owners or primary veterinarian. Results Ionized calcium was above reference range in all cats (median 1.8?mmol/L [interquartile range, 1.5?1.9]). Abnormal tissue was excised after cervical exploration in all cats. The most common histopathologic diagnoses were parathyroid adenoma in 20 of 32 (62.5%) cats and parathyroid carcinoma in 7 of 32 (21.9%) cats. At discharge, 6 of 32 (18.8%) cats had hypercalcemia, 5 of 32 (15.6%) had hypocalcemia, and 21 of 32 (65.6%) were normocalcemic. Preoperative iCa did not correlate with postoperative iCa. The median follow-up time was 332?days (range, 7?3156). Overall median survival time was 1109?days (95% CI, 856?1332). Survival time was not associated with preoperative iCa group, hypocalcemia at discharge, hypercalcemia at discharge, or diagnosis of carcinoma. Conclusion In this cohort of cats, parathyroid adenoma was the most common cause of PHPT, and surgical treatment resulted in very good median survival time. Preoperative iCa was not predictive of postoperative hypocalcemia. Clinical significance Surgical parathyroidectomy for treatment of PHPT in cats provides a favorable prognosis.

AB  - Abstract Patients with chest discomfort or other symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome are one of the most common categories seen in many Emergency Departments (EDs). Although the recognition of patients at high risk of acute coronary syndrome has improved steadily, identifying the majority of chest pain presentations who fall into the low-risk group remains a challenge. Research in this area needs to be transparent, robust, applicable to all hospitals from large tertiary centres to rural and remote sites, and to allow direct comparison between different studies with minimum patient spectrum bias. A standardized approach to the research framework using a common language for data definitions must be adopted to achieve this. The aim was to create a common framework for a standardized data definitions set that would allow maximum value when extrapolating research findings both within Australasian ED practice, and across similar populations worldwide. Therefore a comprehensive data definitions set for the investigation of non-traumatic chest pain patients with possible acute coronary syndrome was developed, specifically for use in the ED setting. This standardized data definitions set will facilitate?knowledge translation? by allowing extrapolation of useful findings into the real-life practice of emergency medicine.

AB  - Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is a powerful tool for medical screening and diagnosis, where a small capsule is swallowed and moved by means of natural peristalsis and gravity through the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The camera-integrated capsule allows for visualization of the small intestine, a region which was previously inaccessible to classical flexible endoscopy. As a diagnostic tool, it allows to localize the sources of bleedings in the middle part of the gastrointestinal tract and to identify diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease), polyposis syndrome, and tumors. The screening and diagnostic efficacy of the WCE, especially in the stomach region, is hampered by a variety of technical challenges like the lack of active capsular position and orientation control. Therapeutic functionality is absent in most commercial capsules, due to constraints in capsular volume and energy storage. The possibility of using body-exogenous magnetic fields to guide, orient, power, and operate the capsule and its mechanisms has led to increasing research in Magnetically Guided Capsule Endoscopy (MGCE). This work shortly reviews the history and state-of-art in WCE technology. It highlights the magnetic technologies for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities of WCE. Not restricting itself to the GI tract, the review further investigates the technological developments in magnetically guided microrobots that can navigate through the various air- and fluid-filled lumina and cavities in the body for minimally invasive medicine.

AB  - Objective? To compare shear stability of simulated humeral lateral condylar fractures reduced with either a self-compressing pin or cortical bone screw. Study Design? In vitro biomechanical tests. Sample Population? Bilateral cadaveric canine humeri (n=18) without evidence of elbow disease. Methods? Lateral condylar fracture was simulated by standardized osteotomy. Bone fragments were stabilized with a self-compressing pin or a cortical bone screw (2.7 or 3.5?mm) inserted in lag fashion. Specimens were mounted in a materials testing system and the condylar fragment displaced in a proximal direction until failure. Mechanical testing variables derived from load?deformation curves were compared between stabilization methods using a Student's paired t-test. Results? There were no statistically significant differences for mechanical testing variables between pin and screw stabilized specimens at expected walk and trot loads. Three yield points subjectively coincided with yield of the interfragmentary interface (Y1), bone at the implant interface (Y2), and implant deformation (Y3). Displacements at Y1 were 48?156% greater for pin than screw stabilized specimens. Y2 and Y3 loads were higher for screw than pin stabilized specimens, but likely supraphysiologic for dogs convalescing after surgical repair. Conclusions? A self-compressing pin or a cortical bone screw inserted in lag fashion both provided adequate strength in applied shear to sustain expected physiologic loads through the repaired canine elbow during postoperative convalescence. Clinical Relevance? Because self-compressing pins were easy to implant and mechanical properties were not significantly different than cortical screws at expected physiologic loads, pins should be considered for the repair of traumatic humeral condylar fractures.

Design and setting:? Retrospective case series chart audit of patients who were managed by St John Ambulance during the M2006. Participants:? Patients who presented requiring first-aid review or treatment at any of the 21 designated event venues or 16 live sites during their prescribed operating hours between 15 March 2006 and 26 March 2006. Main outcome measures:? Provisional diagnosis and ambulance transport to hospital. Results:? A total of 3514 presentations occurred during the study period, of which 2279 (64.9%, 95% CI, 63.3%?66.4%) occurred at event venues. Headaches, soft tissue injuries, blisters and other wounds accounted for 64.1% (95% CI, 62.5%?65.73%) of presentations. A total of 303 patients were referred for further medical care, including 69 patients (1.96%, 95% CI, 1.54%?2.49%) who required transport to hospital via ambulance. Traumatic injuries accounted for 42.0% (95% CI, 30.5%?54.5%) of patients transported by ambulance to hospital. The patient presentation rate across all venues was 0.857 per 1000 patrons. The transport to hospital rate was 0.0186 per 1000 patrons. Conclusions:? The majority of first-aid presentations during the M2006 were of low acuity and treatment resulted in return of patrons to the event, with only a small number requiring ambulance transport to hospital.

AB  - Abstract The influence of temperature on the stability of human serum albumin (HSA) pharmaceutical preparations has been studied by size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography with multi-angle laser-light-scattering detection and by particle-size analysis. The behaviour of HSA in two pharmaceutical preparations stored at different temperatures (40, 55 and 70°C) followed the same pattern?an increase in the relative percentage of dimer (MW 132 000 Da) and aggregate (MW > 200 000 Da), and then a decrease in the concentration of all species and, finally, sudden protein coagulation. These results suggest a time- and temperature-dependent process. At 70°C, monomer only was detected for both preparations; the amount remaining was 83 and 72% for formulations A and B, respectively. Analysis of size-distribution curves also seems to confirm these results. Initially, three distributions were observed with length-volume mean diameters (dl,v)of 1.67, 10.6 and 57 ?m. After 80 days at 55°C, only two distributions were observed, with dl,v of 3.07 and 76 ?m. An additional study using pure HSA at different concentrations (0.3, 2.5, 5 and 10% w/v) and storage at 75°C was performed to determine the influence of the concentration of auxiliary substances and of the HSA. Only when the HSA concentration was 0.3% w/v did the remaining fraction of HSA fit a Prout-Thompkins nucleation model. Initially three distributions with mean sizes of 2, 20 and 40 ?m were observed whereas at the end of the assay only one distribution, mean size 129 ?m, was seen. The methodology used enabled us to separate the HSA degradation products and to determine the absolute molecular weight of albumin monomer and dimer. It is possible to conclude that the degradation mechanism for the formulations studied is complex, and that it is possible to fit the degradation data to Prout-Thompkins kinetics only when the concentration of HSA is low enough (0.3% w/v).

AB  - Summary Human factors in anaesthesia were first highlighted by the publication of the Anaesthetists Non-Technical Skills Framework, and since then an awareness of their importance has gradually resulted in changes in routine clinical practice. This review examines recent literature around human factors in anaesthesia, and highlights recent national reports and guidelines with a focus on team working, communication, situation awareness and human error. We highlight the importance of human factors in modern anaesthetic practice, using the example of complex trauma.

AB  - Author: Alan R Kahn, University of Minnesota A superficial cutaneous dressing, when applied to intact skin over a traumatized area, is effective in preventing the development of pain, bruising, swelling, and inflammation in the deep tissues beneath the skin. When the dressing is applied over an area of skin that has sustained mechanical trauma, the tissues beneath the dressing do not develop pain or bruising, while the tissues outside the boundaries of the dressing become swollen, discolored and painful. A case study describes the experience of a 65-year-old man undergoing arthroscopic surgery for the removal of a torn meniscus and moderate arthritic degeneration in his right knee. A similar operation on his left knee 10 years previously resulted in a prolonged recovery. Immediately after the current surgery, his right knee was wrapped with the cutaneous dressing. Subsequently he experienced no pain or limitation of motion and was fully ambulatory and back to normal activities 2 days after the surgical procedure. A controlled animal study was performed to investigate the effects of the cutaneous dressing on the response of deep tissues subjected to mechanical trauma. Fourteen rabbits were subjected to impact trauma to the gastrocnemius areas of both hind legs, after which one leg was wrapped with the cutaneous dressing and the other leg was wrapped with a control bandage. Observations of the legs over several days revealed little or no abnormality in the treated legs while the control legs developed moderate to severe inflammation and swelling. Preliminary experimental evidence suggests that this cutaneous dressing inhibits the activity of the nociceptive neurons in the epithelium which, in turn, blocks the response of the spinal dorsal root mechanism that is responsible for generating swelling, inflammation, and pain.

AB  - Low back pain is often associated with tensional changes in the paraspinal muscles detected by palpatory procedures. Shear wave elastography (SWE), recently introduced, allows the stiffness of muscles to be assessed noninvasively. The aim of this work was to study the feasibility of using SWE on the three main lumbar back muscles (multifidus, longissimus, and iliocostalis) in vivo after analyzing their muscular architecture ex vivo. We determined the orientation of fibers in the multifidus, longissimus, and iliocotalis muscles in seven fresh cadavers using gross anatomy and B-Mode ultrasound imaging. We then quantified the stiffness of these three muscles at the L3 level ex vivo and in 16 healthy young adults. Little pennation was observed in the longissimus and iliocostalis, in which the direction of fibers was almost parallel to the line of spinous processes. The multifidus appeared as a multiceps and multipennate muscle. Given the random layering of millimetric fascicles, tendons, and fatty spaces, the multifidus had multiple fiber orientations. Muscular fascicles and fibers were oriented from 9° to 22° to the line of spinous processes. The shear moduli related to stiffness were 6.9?±?2.7 kPa for the longissimus, 4.9?±?1.4 kPa for the iliocostalis, and 5.4?±?1.6 kPa for the multifidus. SWE is a feasible method for quantifying the stiffness of the lumbar back muscles. Clin. Anat. 30:774?780, 2017. ? 2017Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objectively Tendinopathy is a common problem in sports medicine which can lead to severe morbidity. Aspirin, as the classical representative of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions, has been commonly used in treating tendinopathy. While its treatment effects on injury tendon healing are lacking, illuminating the underlying mechanism may provide scientific basis for clinical treatment. Materials and methods Firstly, we used immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR to detect changes in CD14, CD206, iNOS, IL-6, IL-10, MMP-3, TIMP-3, Col-1a1, biglycan, Comp, Fibronectin, TGF-?1?ACAN?EGR-1 and FMOD. Next, Western blot was used to measure the protein levels (IL-6, IL-10, TGF-?1, COMP, TIMP-3, STAT-3/P-STAT-3 and JNK/P-JNK) in TSCs. Then, migration and proliferation of TSCs were measured through wound healing test and BrdU staining. Finally, the mechanical properties of injury tendon were detected. Results After aspirin treatment, the inflammation and scar formation in injury tendon were significantly inhibited by aspirin. Still, tendon's ECM was positively balanced. Increasing migration and proliferation ability of TSCs induced by IL-1? were significantly reversed. JNK/STAT-3 signalling pathway participated in the process above. In addition, biomechanical properties of injury tendon were significantly improved. Conclusions Taken together, the findings suggested that aspirin inhibited inflammation and scar formation via regulation of JNK/STAT-3 signalling and decreased rerupture risk of injury tendon. Aspirin could be an ideal therapeutic strategy in tendon injury healing.

AB  - Summary Major burn injury remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. With advances in burn care and with the development of experienced multi-disciplinary teams at regionalized burn centers, many children are surviving severe burn injury. As members of the multi-disciplinary care team, anesthesia providers are called upon to care for these critically ill children. These children provide several anesthetic challenges, such as difficult airways, difficult vascular access, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, altered temperature regulation, sepsis, cardiovascular instability, and increased requirements of muscle relaxants and opioids. The anesthesia provider must understand the physiologic derangements that occur with severe burn injury as well as the subsequent anesthetic implications.

AB  - We aimed to identify statistical predictor variables of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced physical sickness symptoms during the acute and late inflammatory phases using multivariate regression analyses. Data from N?=?128 healthy volunteers who received i.v. LPS injection (0.4 or 0.8?ng/kg) or placebo were pooled for analyses. Physical sickness symptoms experienced during the acute (0?6h postinjection) and late (6?24h postinjection) phases were assessed with the validated General-Assessment-of-Side-Effects (GASE) questionnaire. LPS-treated subjects reported significantly more physical sickness symptoms. Physical symptoms during the acute phase were associated with LPS-induced mood impairments and interleukin (IL)-6 increases, explaining 28.5% of variance in GASE scores. During late phase, LPS-induced increases in cortisol and IL-6 plasma concentrations and baseline depression were significant predictor variables, explaining 38.5% of variance. In patients with recurrent or chronic inflammatory states, these factors may act as risk factors ultimately contributing to an exacerbation of sickness symptoms, and should be considered as potential targets for therapeutic strategies.
