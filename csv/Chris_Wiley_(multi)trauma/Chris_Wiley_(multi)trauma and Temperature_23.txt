AB  - Abstract. Objectives: Advances in the field of cardiopulmonary resuscitation have led to an increasing number of patients initially surviving sudden cardiac arrest. Unfortunately, most of these patients do not recover from the resultant anoxic brain insult. Several animal and human trials have suggested that post-resuscitative brain hypothermia may improve neurologic recovery after cardiopulmonary arrest. Present cooling methods are slow, induce only brain surface cooling, or result in systemic hypothermia. The authors tested the hypothesis that unilateral hypothermic carotid bypass would induce bilateral brain cooling without evoking systemic hypothermia or hemodynamic instability. Methods: Anesthetized, ventilated common swine (n= 6, 24-37 kg) underwent right femoral and carotid artery bypass cannulation. Central and peripheral hemodynamic parameters were recorded every 2 minutes throughout the procedure. Thermodynamic parameters included bilateral frontal lobe, bilateral nasopharyngeal, pulmonary artery, and rectal temperatures. Hypothermic femoral?carotid bypass was accomplished by drawing blood from the right femoral artery, cooling it to 24°C, and returning it to the right carotid artery at a flow rate of 5 mL/kg/min for 30 minutes. Results: With initiation of cooling, brain temperatures dropped rapidly from baseline of 37.2°C to 30.6°C (right frontal lobe) and 33.1°C (left frontal lobe) at 30 minutes. Pulmonary artery and rectal temperatures also decreased, but never reached mild hypothermic levels (34°C). There was no significant change in any hemodynamic parameters during brain cooling. Conclusions: Femoral?carotid hypothermic bypass rapidly induced a state of selective brain hypothermia without causing systemic hypothermia or hemodynamic instability.

AB  - Summary Musculoskeletal pain in dogs and cats may be of traumatic origin or associated with a medical illness. Patients with deep wounds and fractures will require analgesia, frequently multi-modal; however, initially, the drug and dose chosen will be determined by the overall stability of the patient in addition to the severity and location of the orthopedic and soft tissue injury. Sedated and or depressed patients may allow placement of monitoring equipment, which will be beneficial during the induction phase and transfer to inhalant anesthesia. Panosteitis, hypertrophic osteodystrophy (HOD), immune-mediated polyarthritis, osteomyelitis and cancer of muscle and bone are very painful. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs), previously called schwannomas or neurofibromas, are a primary cause of chronic neurogenic lameness in dogs and cats. Local techniques to consider for musculoskeletal pain or fractures of the thoracic limb are: cervical paravertebral nerve block, brachial plexus nerve block and IV regional anesthesia.

AB  - Summary Available sap flow methods are still far from being simple, cheap and reliable enough to be used beyond very specific research purposes. This study presents and tests a new single-probe heat pulse (SPHP) method for monitoring sap velocity in trees using a single-probe sensor, rather than the multi-probe arrangements used up to now. Based on the fundamental conduction?convection principles of heat transport in sapwood, convective velocity (Vh) is estimated from the temperature increase in the heater after the application of a heat pulse (?T). The method was validated against measurements performed with the compensation heat pulse (CHP) technique in field trees of six different species. To do so, a dedicated three-probe sensor capable of simultaneously applying both methods was produced and used. Experimental measurements in the six species showed an excellent agreement between SPHP and CHP outputs for moderate to high flow rates, confirming the applicability of the method. In relation to other sap flow methods, SPHP presents several significant advantages: it requires low power inputs, it uses technically simpler and potentially cheaper instrumentation, the physical damage to the tree is minimal and artefacts caused by incorrect probe spacing and alignment are removed.

AB  - 1 Tallie Z. Baram, 1 Kristen L. Brunson, 1 Celine Dube, 1 Sarit Avishai-Eliner, and 1 Kristina A. Fenoglio ( 1 Pediatrics, Anatomy/ Neurobiology, UCI, Irvine, CA ) Seizures often arise in the setting of an acute injury or insult. In addition, many of the epilepsies are ?symptomatic?, i.e., they occur in individuals who had sustained injury or insult such as infection, trauma, or stroke. The mechanisms by which diverse factors such as infection or trauma provoke both acute seizures and recurrent, chronic seizures (epilepsy) are not fully understood. To some extent, each of these insults may initiate a unique chain of events that promotes epilepsy. However, these insults also share commonalities that set in motion cellular and molecular changes that promote neuronal hyperexcitability: All these epilepsy- provoking insults are stressful, in that they trigger the release and actions of ?stress-mediating molecules?, including glucocorticoids and the intrinsic central nervous system (CNS) stress-activated neuro-peptide, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). Stress induces release of CRH from hippocampal interneurons, and CRH acts on selective receptors (CRF-R1) to enhance glutamate-mediated neurotransmission. In immature hippocampus, CRH and the CRH receptors are particularly abundant, so that the peptide may excite neurons sufficiently to evoke seizures, followed by dendritic atrophy or death of vulnerable neurons. In animal models, chronic enhancement of CRH levels within the developing hippocampus, may result in enduring reduction of hippocampus- governed learning and memory function. Such levels might be found in infants with chronic CNS stressors including congenital infection, dysplasia, trauma or recurrent seizures. Indeed, drugs that downregulate CRH levels in limbic structures (e.g., ACTH) are potent antiepileptics in the developing CNS. In summary, acute and chronic stress elicits the release of pro-excitatory molecules (CRH), promoting seizures. These further activate the ?stress response?, leading to a vicious cycle culminating in loss of neuronal function and integrity.

AB  - Alpha2 agonists have a significant role in epidural anaesthetic techniques. However, there are few reports regarding epidural administration of these drugs especially in small animals (Greene et al. 1995; Keegan et al. 1995; Vesal et al. 1996). This study compared the haemodynamic effects of xylazine and medetomidine after epidural injection in dogs. Six dogs (four females and two males) weighing 27.5?±?3.39?kg, aged 5.6?±?1.42?years were studied on two separate occasions one month apart. Dogs were sedated with 0.5?mg?kg?1 diazepam IM and 0.1?mg?kg?1 acepromazine IM. After 20?minutes, a lumbosacral epidural injection of 0.25?mg?kg?1 xylazine was administered (group X). One month later, following the same sedation, 15?µg?kg?1 medetomidine was administered epidurally (group M). Haemodynamic variables (ECG and indirect blood pressure (Doppler)), respiratory rate and rectal temperature were recorded before (baseline) and then every 5?minutes after the epidural injection, up to 60?minutes. Differences between groups were compared by a paired t-test. Within group changes were compared to basal values by anova. A p-value of?<?0.05 was considered statistically significant. Both groups showed significant reductions in heart rate (106.3?±?7.7 beats?minute?1 baseline versus 67.7?±?7.6 (group M); 91?±?3.8 baseline versus 52.3?±?9 (group X)) and mean arterial blood pressure (113.1?±?12.3?mm?Hg baseline versus 87?±?11 (group M); 118?±?7 baseline versus 91?±?14 (group X)). There were no differences between groups in these variables. After epidural injection, first degree atrioventricular block was recorded significantly more often in group X (50% against 33%) but second degree block was significantly more frequent in group M (66% against 33%). Also 50% of dogs in group X and 66% in group M showed sinus arrest. Respiratory rate decreased significantly in both groups following the epidural injection (20.66?±?0.66?minute?1 baseline versus 16.33?±?4.77 (group M); 37.66?±?0.56 baseline versus 16.33?±?1.81 group X), but no differences between groups were observed. Rectal temperature decreased significantly in group X (38.16?±?0.21) with respect to the basal measurement (39.30?±?0.14?°C). In group M, there was no significant reduction in temperature, however, no statistical difference in rectal temperature was found between groups. This study shows that 0.25?mg?kg?1 xylazine and 15?µg?kg?1 medetomidine produce similar, significant cardiovascular and respiratory changes following lumbosacral epidural administration in dogs.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare the postoperative analgesic effects of intravenous (IV) lidocaine, meloxicam, and their combination in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Study design Prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. Animals Twenty-seven dogs aged (mean ± SD) 16.1 ± 7.5 months and weighing 22.4 ± 17.9 kg scheduled for ovariohysterectomy. Methods Anaesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with isoflurane. Dogs (n = 9 in each group) were allocated to receive just prior to and during surgery one of the following regimens: M group, 0.2 mg kg?1 IV meloxicam then a continuous rate infusion (CRI) of lactated Ringer's at 10 mL kg?1 hour?1; L group, a bolus of lidocaine (1 mg kg?1 IV) then a CRI of lidocaine at 0.025 mg kg?1 minute?1; and M + L group, both the above meloxicam and lidocaine treatments. Pain and sedation were scored, and venous samples taken for serum cortisol and glucose measurement before and at intervals for 12 hours after anaesthesia. Pain scores were assessed using a multi-parameter subjective scoring scale (cumulative scale 0?21) by three observers. The protocol stated that dogs with a total score exceeding 9 or a sub-score above 3 in any one category would receive rescue analgesia. Sedation was scored on a scale of 0?4. Results There were no significant differences in subjective pain scores, serum cortisol, and glucose concentrations between the three groups. The highest pain score at any time was 5, and no dog required rescue analgesia. None of the three regimens caused any observable side effects during or after anaesthesia. At 1 and 2 hours after extubation dogs in group L were significantly more sedated than in the other two groups. Conclusions and Clinical relevance This study suggests that, with the scoring system used, IV lidocaine and meloxicam provide similar and adequate post-operative analgesia in healthy dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the use of a gastrointestinal anastomosis (GIA) stapling device to perform small intestinal anastomosis in the dog. Methods: A retrospective study to evaluate the use of a GIA stapling device to perform small intestinal anastomosis in 15 dogs. Results: Reasons for intervention included dehiscence of a previous enterotomy (four of 15), intestinal neoplasia (five of 15), vascular compromise (three of 15), intussusception (two of 15) and foreign body (one of 15). The mean time taken to perform the anastomosis was 7·7 minutes (range five to 12 minutes). No operative complications were recorded and all dogs recovered from the surgery. Major (two dogs) and minor (six dogs) short-term complications of pyrexia and anorexia were recorded in six dogs. In five of these, the cause was considered to be related to a pre-existing peritonitis. One dog was euthanased five months postoperatively for a multi-centric recurrence of intestinal lymphoma. Six month follow-up confirmed an unremarkable and complete recovery in all remaining dogs. No major or minor long-term complications were recorded in any individual. Clinical Significance: A modified stapled functional end-to-end intestinal anastomosis holds merit and should be considered a viable alternative to other stapled and sutured anastomosis techniques.

AB  - Purpose:? The aim was to evaluate the disinfection properties of six multi-purpose contact lens disinfection solutions (MPDS) available in Iran against Fusarium solani and Candida albicans, based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14729 guidelines. Methods:? Three lots each of six multi-purpose solutions, namely, Renu MultiPlus, Solo Care Aqua, All-Clean soft, Contact All In One Advanced, Hippia, Ginza Multi-Purpose Solution and 0.9% normal saline solution were inoculated with standard strains of Fusarium solani (ATCC 36031) and Candida albicans (ATCC 10231). Surviving fungi were determined by counting colony-forming units on recovery plates at specified times. The mean log reduction in fungal numbers at the manufacturer's minimum recommended disinfection time was determined and compared with the criteria for stand-alone disinfection products for each MPDS against each fungal strain. Results:? Renu MultiPlus, Contact All In One Advanced and All-Clean Soft were effective in achieving the mean 1.0 log reduction in fungal numbers, based on ISO 14729 stand-alone primary acceptance criteria. Solo Care Aqua failed to achieve the ISO 14729 stand-alone primary acceptance criteria for Candida albicans. The other solutions were not effective against test microorganisms after the specified times. Conclusions:? There were differences in the rates of disinfection efficacy. Generally, Renu MultiPlus, Contact All In One Advanced and All-Clean Soft exceeded the primary acceptance criteria of the ISO 14729 guidelines for stand-alone contact lens solutions.

AB  - Abstract Lipid distribution in the brain is important for many biological functions and has been associated with some brain diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate lipid distribution in different regions of brain tissue in mice. To this end, substantia nigra (SN), caudate putamen (CPu), hippocampus (Hip), hypothalamus (Hyp), and cortex (Cx) tissues of mice were analyzed using direct infusion nanoelectrospray-ion trap mass spectrometry and multivariate analyses. The SN, CPu, Hip, Hyp, and Cx groups showed clear differences in lipid distribution using principal component analysis and a partial least-squares discriminant analysis score plot, and lipid levels were significantly different in different brain regions. In particular, sulfatides were mainly distributed in the SN region. Our results could be used to help understand the functions and mechanisms of lipids in various brain diseases.

AB  - Haemorrhage remains a major cause of potentially preventable deaths. Trauma and massive transfusion are associated with coagulopathy secondary to tissue injury, hypoperfusion, dilution and consumption of clotting factors and platelets. Concepts of damage control surgery have evolved, prioritizing the early control of the cause of bleeding by non-definitive means, while haemostatic control resuscitation seeks early control of coagulopathy. Haemostatic resuscitation provides transfusions with plasma and platelets in addition to red blood cells (RBCs) in an immediate and sustained manner as part of the transfusion protocol for massively bleeding patients. Transfusion of RBCs, plasma and platelets in a similar proportion as in whole blood prevents both hypovolaemia and coagulopathy. Although an early and effective reversal of coagulopathy is documented, the most effective means of preventing coagulopathy of massive transfusion remains debated and randomized controlled studies are lacking. Results from recent before-and-after studies in massively bleeding patients indicate that trauma exsanguination protocols involving the early administration of plasma and platelets are associated with improved survival. Furthermore, viscoelastic whole blood assays, such as thrombelastography (TEG)/rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM), appear advantageous for identifying coagulopathy in patients with severe haemorrhage, as opposed to conventional coagulation assays. In our view, patients with uncontrolled bleeding, regardless of its cause, should be treated with goal-directed haemostatic control resuscitation involving the early administration of plasma and platelets and based on the results of the TEG/ROTEM analysis. The aim of the goal-directed therapy should be to maintain a normal haemostatic competence until surgical haemostasis is achieved, as this appears to be associated with reduced mortality.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare isoflurane and propofol for maintenance of anesthesia and quality of recovery in client-owned dogs with intracranial disease undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Study design Prospective, randomized, clinical trial. Animals Twenty-five client-owned dogs with intracranial pathology, 13 females and 12 males, ages 11 months to 13 years, weighing between 3.0 and 48.0 kg. Methods Each dog was randomly assigned to receive propofol or isoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia. All dogs were not premedicated, were administered propofol intravenously to effect for induction, intubated and mechanically ventilated to maintain an end-tidal carbon dioxide tension 30?35 mmHg (4.0?4.7 kPa). Temperature and cardiac output were measured pre- and post-MRI. Scores for mentation, neurological status, ease of maintenance, and recovery were obtained pre- and post-anesthesia. Pulse oximetry, end-tidal gases, arterial blood pressure, heart rate (HR) and requirements for dopamine administration to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg were recorded throughout anesthesia. Results End-tidal isoflurane concentration was 0.73 ± 0.35% and propofol infusion rate was 292 ± 119 ?g kg?1 minute?1. Cardiac index was higher, while HR was lower, with propofol than isoflurane in dogs younger than 5 years, but not in older dogs. Dogs maintained with isoflurane were 14.7 times more likely to require dopamine than propofol dogs. Mentation and maintenance scores and temperature were not different. MAP and diastolic arterial pressure were higher in the propofol group. Recovery scores were better with propofol, although times to extubation were similar. Change in neurological score from pre- to post-anesthesia was not different between treatments. Conclusions Dogs maintained with propofol during MRI had higher arterial pressures, decreased requirements for dopamine, and better recovery scores, compared to dogs maintained with isoflurane. Clinical relevance Propofol anesthesia offered cardiovascular and recovery advantages over isoflurane during MRI in dogs with intracranial disease in this study.

AB  - Abstract The indoor environment of a mechanically ventilated hospital building controls infection rates as well as influences patients? healing processes and overall medical outcomes. This review covers the scientific research that has assessed patients? medical outcomes concerning at least one indoor environmental parameter related to building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, such as indoor air temperature, relative humidity, and indoor air ventilation parameters. Research related to the naturally ventilated hospital buildings was outside the scope of this review article. After 1998, a total of 899 papers were identified that fit the inclusion criteria of this study. Of these, 176 papers have been included in this review to understand the relationship between the health outcomes of a patient and the indoor environment of a mechanically ventilated hospital building. The purpose of this literature review was to summarize how indoor environmental parameters related to mechanical ventilation systems of a hospital building are impacting patients. This review suggests that there is a need for future interdisciplinary collaborative research to quantify the optimum range for HVAC parameters considering airborne exposures and patients? positive medical outcomes.

AB  - Abstract In vitro models of traumatic injury are useful adjuncts to animal models for studying mechanisms of post-traumatic cell death. Here we describe a new in vitro model in which reproducible levels of injury are delivered by a punch device that produces 28 parallel cuts in individual wells of 96-well microplates. Cell loss is measured by LDH assay or quantitative fluorometric assay for ethidium homodimer staining. Glial cultures show cell death restricted to the initial injury site, whereas neuronal/glial cultures demonstrate substantial spread of cell loss over time. We used this model to examine the role of pH and NMDA receptors in delayed post-traumatic injury. NMDA receptor blockade by dizocilpine (MK-801) or treatment with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directed against NMDAR1 was neuroprotective. Decreased cell death was observed under acidic conditions whereas increased extracellular pH was associated with increased, MK-801 sensitive cell loss. Advantages of our model include: reproducible trauma induction; rapid measurements of cell injury; and use of 96-well microplates which reduce time and cost. This model appears to be well-suited for the study of selected mechanisms of post-traumatic neuronal injury as well as for screening potential neuroprotective agents. J. Neurosci.

AB  - Abstract Mospd1 codes for a small protein with unknown physiological function, which is part of a family of genes, including Mospd2 and Mospd3, defined by the presence of the major sperm protein domain and two transmembrane domains. This work characterizes the Mospd1 gene, the intracellular location of the protein and its expression in different mouse tissues and mesenchymal cell lines during differentiation. The role of Mospd1 in mesenchymal cellular differentiation was studied by siRNA knockdown experiments in mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Transfection experiments of the targeted cDNA show MOSPD1 located in the endoplasmatic reticulum and in the Golgi apparatus. Removal of the last exon of the gene resulted in localization of the protein in the nucleus, which was attributed to a nuclear export sequence in the N-terminal part. In mouse tissues the gene was generally strongly expressed while mesenchymal tissues showed the highest expression. In mesenchymal cell lines Mospd1 mRNA was higher expressed in cells with advanced differentiation status. In osteoblastic, myoblastic, and adipocytic cell lines Mospd1 was up-regulated during differentiation. Genome-wide gene expression analysis after knockdown of Mospd1 by siRNA in MC3T3-E1 cells revealed a shift in the gene expression pattern from mesenchymal to epithelial genes featuring up-regulation of the epithelial cadherin Cdh1 and down-regulation of its inhibitors Snail1 and 2 and the mesenchymal cadherin Cdh11, suggesting a mesenchymal to epithelial transition. From these data we conclude that Mospd1 plays a pivotal role in the developmental regulation at the switch between mesenchymal and epithelial cells. J. Cell.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the physiological variables, arterial blood gas values, induction of anesthesia quality, and recovery quality using the combination of butorphanol, midazolam and alfaxalone in dogs. Animals Ten healthy adult Beagle dogs weighing 8.3 ± 3.1 kg. Methods Rectal temperature (T), pulse rate (PR), respiratory rate (fR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and arterial blood gases were measured and recorded prior to intravenous (IV) administration of butorphanol, prior to administration of both midazolam and alfaxalone IV 10 minutes later, then every 5 minutes for 20 minutes. M-mode echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) indices were measured before and 5 minutes after administration of alfaxalone. Qualitative scores for induction of anesthesia and recovery were allocated, duration of anesthesia and recovery were calculated, and adverse events were recorded. Results Scores for induction and recovery quality were excellent. No significant adverse events were observed. Mean ± SD time from induction to extubation and to standing (full recovery) was 29 ± 6 and 36 ± 8 minutes, respectively. There were statistically significant changes in PR, fR and MAP after drug administration. Transient hypercarbia developed after alfaxalone injection. The echocardiographic LV indices were reduced after alfaxalone injection, although those changes were not statistically significant. Conclusions and clinical relevance The combination of butorphanol, midazolam and alfaxalone provided excellent quality of induction of anesthesia and exerted minimal cardiopulmonary effects in healthy dogs.

AB  - Abstract The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1), contributes to neuronal inflammation and cell death induced by ischemia, excitotoxicity, or trauma, while administration of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) reduces neuronal injury. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that endogenous IL-1ra is neuroprotective in vivo and in vitro, and to identify its mechanism of actions. Mice lacking IL-1ra (IL-1ra knock-out (KO]) exhibited a dramatic increase in neuronal injury (3.6-fold increase in infarct size) induced by transient cerebral ischemia compared to wild-type (WT) animals. Basal cell death of cultured cortical neurons from WT and IL-1ra KO was identical, and treatment with NMDA or AMPA (20 ?M) increased cell death to the same extent in WT and IL-1ra KO neurons. However, basal and NMDA- or AMPA-induced cells death was significantly higher in glial?neuronal co-cultures from IL-1ra KO than from WT mice. We further showed that pure microglial cultures, but not pure astrocytes cultures, released IL-1ra in response to treatment with conditioned medium from NMDA- or AMPA-treated primary neurons. These results demonstrate that endogenous IL-1ra produced by microglia is neuroprotective in cerebral ischemia or excitotoxicity. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background: More than 100,000 people each year are admitted to U.S. hospitals for severe burn injury. Strikingly, ethanol use prior to injury is apparent in nearly 50% of burn patients, rendering them six times more likely to die from infection than patients not exposed to ethanol. We previously reported that the kinetics and magnitude of neutrophil chemokine production and subsequent accumulation of neutrophils in the lung was dramatically altered when ethanol exposure preceded injury. Here, we tested whether burn injury and ethanol exposure combined, altered susceptibility to infection, neutrophil chemoattractant production, and neutrophil accumulation at the site of the burn wound. Methods: Male B6D2F 1 mice were administered a dose of ethanol designed to achieve 90?100 mg/dl circulating levels and 30 min later subjected to a 15% total body surface area dorsal scald injury. Susceptibility to topically applied Pseudomonas aeruginosa was examined. At various times after injury, burn wound and normal tissues were collected for assessments of neutrophil counts, myeloperoxidase quantitation, and neutrophil chemoattractant (KC and MIP-2) production. Results: Ethanol exposure prior to burn injury enhanced susceptibility to infection after burn and was associated with significantly elevated production of KC, but not MIP-2, at the wound site. Despite the enhanced elevation of KC, neutrophil accumulation in the wounds of ethanol exposed, burn injured mice did not differ from those that received burn injury alone. TNFα (a potent activator of neutrophils), however, was found to be significantly elevated in the wounds of mice that received only burn injury, but not in those that received injury in combination with prior ethanol exposure. Conclusion: In the presence of ethanol, neutrophils are adequately recruited to the site of burn injury, but their host defense functions are impaired, perhaps due to the lack of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα.

AB  - Summary Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) has been described in foals for over 80 years. This condition has a diversity of names including ?dummy foals', ?wanderers', ?barkers', neonatal encephalopathy, neonatal maladjustment syndrome (NMS) and perinatal asphyxia syndrome (PAS). The latter descriptive terms are all encompassing for a syndrome that has varying degrees of multi-systemic effects rather than just neurological disease. While foals with PAS are commonly reported in the literature, the aetiology and underlying pathophysiology are still very poorly understood, with a majority of the information extrapolated from human and animal models. Currently, no antemortem test exists and diagnosis is made based on the history of the mare and foal as well as reliance on clinical signs. Recent studies have shown that neuroactive pregnanes may play a key role in the syndrome; however, further research is needed to clarify these findings. Another investigation compared neurobiomarkers for brain injury in both sick and normal neonatal foals. The mainstay of therapy for PAS is supportive treatment. Specific therapies such as antioxidants and neuroprotectants are used by some clinicians but little scientific evidence exists that proves the therapeutic protocols implemented improve overall outcome. Prevention of PAS in foals revolves around the health of the mare including, but not limited to, the prevention of placentitis or other illnesses and observation and/or intervention during parturition when necessary. More research is necessary to fully comprehend this syndrome, its diagnosis and treatment options.

AB  - Abstract Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a widely used clinical anesthetic with proven anti-inflammatory effects. Both high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and pyroptosis play an important role in the inflammatory response to infection and trauma. Thus far, there have been no studies published addressing the effect of DEX on HMGB1 and pyroptosis. In order to fill this gap in the literature, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were exposed to HMGB1 (4?µg/mL) with or without DEX (50??M) pretreatment. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 1? (IL-1?), and IL-18], phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and P38, and the activation of caspase-1 were measured by enzyme immunosorbent assay, western blot analysis, confocal microscope, and flow cytometry, respectively. We found that DEX protected against HMGB1-induced cell death of BMDMs. In addition, DEX suppressed the generation of TNF-α, IL-1?, and IL-18 as well as the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and P38. Moreover, DEX inhibited caspase-1 activation and decreased pyroptosis. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the protective effect of DEX in mediating HMGB1-induced cellular injury, thus indicating that DEX may be a potential therapeutic candidate for the management of infection and trauma-derived inflammation.

AB  - Abstract Microcirculatory properties of tumors play a pivotal role in tumor progression and inefficacy of therapies. It has been hypothesized that surgical interventions result in an accelerated tumor growth by increasing the level of pro-angiogenic cytokines with subsequent amplification of tumor angiogenesis. To characterize the microvascular properties of secondary bone tumors in vivo and determine the impact of minor surgery on the microcirculation, we performed intravital microscopy over 25 days using a xenograft model of breast cancer tumor growth (MCF-7) in bone. After engraftment of tumors the mice were treated with a mastectomy versus no surgery. Tumor growth was accompanied by angiogenic sprouting and decreased vascular diameters while blood flow rate and tumor perfusion remained constant. Mastectomy initially led to a significant reduction of functional vascular density, increased vascular diameter, and decreased blood flow velocities. However, neither tumor growth nor tissue perfusion was different between the groups. The presented study corroborates the assumption that tumor microcirculation in bone exhibits similar time-dependent alterations compared to soft tissue tumors. A minor surgical intervention did not change tumor growth kinetics however microcirculatory properties were altered. Whether major surgery has an impact on tumor growth in bone should be clarified in further studies. ? 2010 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
