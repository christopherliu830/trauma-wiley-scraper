AB  - A five-year-old male German shepherd dog presented with traumatic craniodorsal luxation of the right coxofemoral joint with pre-existing moderate hip dysplasia. A femoral head and neck ostectomy was performed. The patient was sedated with acepromazine and morphine administered intramuscularly. A?lumbosacral epidural was performed using a combination of morphine and ropivacaine. Intraoperatively, an infusion of medetomidine, morphine, lidocaine, and ketamine was administered intravenously, and oxygen was administered via facemask. Heart rate, respiratory rate and oscillometric arterial blood pressures were monitored. Postoperatively, carprofen was administered once subcutaneously. On the day of hospital discharge, carprofen and tramadol were administered orally every 12?hours. Twenty-one days later, the dog was doing well and the surgical staples were removed. Sedation with acepromazine and morphine, administration of an epidural containing morphine and ropivacaine, and intraoperative sedation with medetomidine, morphine, lidocaine and ketamine were suitable for femoral head and neck ostectomy.

AB  - Purpose? This study aimed to evaluate the pattern of solid intra-abdominal organ injuries in Central Australia, with focus on the mechanism of injury, Injury Severity Score (ISS), distribution of injury, role of surgical intervention and their outcome. It aimed to assess if difference exists in the above perimeters between the indigenous and non-indigenous population. Methodology? This is a retrospective analysis of a selected group of patients as identified by ICD Codes. Database has been created for patients admitted with renal, pancreatic, hepatic and splenic trauma over a five-year period (2001?2005). Data on demographics, mechanism of injury, distribution of injury, length of stay and ISS has been collected. Results? Seventy-one patients has been identified, with 51 (72%) indigenous and 20 (28%) non-indigenous. 29 patients (41%) were involved in a Motor Vehicle Accident and 33 (46%) were assaulted. There is no statistical difference with the distribution of injury and ISS amongst indigenous and non-indigenous populations. However there appears to have a higher incidence of surgical intervention associated with the indigenous group (28.8% versus 12.5%). This may be explained by the compliance rate as 29.4% of indigenous patients left against medical advice as compared with 0% with the non-indigenous group. Conclusion? The mechanism, pattern and severity of injury appear to be comparable amongst the indigenous and non-indigenous population in Central Australia. However there is a difference in their incidence of surgical intervention. ISS may not be as useful in prediction for need for intervention in this group and a different approach to trauma management may need to be tailored to this population.

AB  - Abstract Conservation breeding for reintroduction is becoming a popular option for restoring threatened populations. Whereas post-release results are widely reported in the conservation literature, little empirical information is presented on the captive populations that often make such releases possible, even though fecundity, fertility and survival rates can have an impact on the outcome and cost of wild population re-establishment. We present results of survival analyses carried out on a captive population of houbara bustards to determine peak periods of mortality, and by identifying sources of variations in mortality to recognize the potential impact of management practices on productivity. There were two main mortality peaks: during incubation (53% survival of fertile eggs), and by 6 months post-hatching (75% survival of hatchlings). Management-related variables influencing survival of eggs and chicks included the year when laid, the cohort of females laying them, and possibly sex. Most post-hatching deaths were due to trauma and infectious diseases. Trauma-related deaths usually follow collisions with cages, and imply selection for the captive environment, an undesirable trend in populations maintained for reintroductions. Reducing losses during incubation would have the largest impact on production of birds for reintroduction, enabling the release of more birds, and reducing the overall costs of the project.

AB  - Abstract Objective To quantify stability in cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) deficient canine stifles with hamstring grafts affixed at 3 femoral locations. Study Design Canine stifle motion study using a multi-cohort, repeated measures design. Sample Population 27 canine cadaver stifles. Methods Hamstring grafts (HG) were affixed at the gracilis-semitendinosus insertion and on the lateral femur (1) proximal trochlear ridge (TR), (2) craniodistal to fabella (F), or (3) condyle center (CC). Total, cranial, and caudal tibial translation and total, medial, and lateral angular displacement, with and without translational load, were quantified with the CrCL intact, transected, and reconstructed. Angular displacement was quantified from points on the distal femur and proximal tibia. Graft strain was calculated from tissue displacement measured at joint angles of 30°, 60°, 90°, and 120°. Results Tibial translation was lowest in F constructs, which also achieved the least difference in tibial translation from intact stifles. Tibial translation was lower in intact stifles than in CrCL transected or reconstructed stifles. Less angular displacement of the proximal tibia was detected in the medial than in the lateral direction, and tibial displacement was lower in the cranial than the caudal direction. Angular displacement was lowest in the F treatment group. F constructs had the lowest graft strain at joint angles greater than 30°. Conclusions Femoral fixation of a canine hamstring graft craniodistal to the lateral fabella conferred the best joint stability and lowest graft strain in vitro. No fixation method restored joint stability of the intact CrCL.

AB  - Summary Whole blood re-calcification times were evaluated as a measure of endotoxin-associated coagulopathy in horses. First, the effects of endotoxin concentration and duration of in vitro incubation of citrated whole blood with endotoxin on the whole blood re-calcification time of blood collected from healthy horses were determined. Increasing concentrations or incubation times of endotoxin accelerated the whole blood re-calcification time. This effect was attributed mainly to increased monocyte thromboplastin activity. Second, whole blood re-calcification time, a clotting profile, plasma factor VII activity and plasma endotoxin concentration on blood samples obtained from 35 equine colic patients and 10 healthy horses were determined. Compared with healthy horses, colic patients had a longer mean whole blood re-calcification and prothrombin time, lower per cent factor VII activity and higher mean fibrin degradation products concentration. Within the colic patient group, horses that did not survive had detectable endotoxin in plasma, longer whole blood re-calcification and prothrombin times, and lower plasma factor VII activity, compared with colic patients that survived. These data indicate that colic patients with endotoxaemia experience hypercoagulable states, followed by consumptive coagulopathy. Although the cause of endotoxin-associated coagulopathy is likely multi-factorial, increased expression of monocyte thromboplastin activity may be involved in the pathogenesis of coagulopathy. The whole blood re-calcification time is a simple, fast and inexpensive way to detect coagulopathy during endotoxaemia and determine the prognosis for survival.

AB  - Background and Objective Bile duct stricture is an uncommon disease in gastroenterology resulting from postoperative trauma. In spite of non-surgical treatments, clinical outcomes for the biliary strictures still encounter high restenosis and stent migration. The objective of the current study was to investigate the feasible application of a balloon catheter-integrated diffing applicator to thermally treat the bile duct stricture. Materials and Methods 400-?m optical fibers were micro-machined and then integrated with an inflatable balloon catheter. The fabricated applicator was tested on porcine bile ducts with 20-W 980 nm laser light for 60 s, and a thermal camera was used to measure thermal response of the tissue. Due to mechanical pressure, the inflated balloon was able to expand the tissue lumen up to 6 mm in diameter. Results Compared to control, the inner area of the treated tissue was increased by four fold (i.e., 2.74±0.05 mm2 for treated vs. 0.73±0.14 mm2 for control) during the balloon catheter-assisted laser irradiation. The laser-induced tissue temperature reached up to 80.1±6.4 °C (thermal gradient = 1.2 °C/s). A thin layer of coagulation necrosis (0.5±0.1 mm) consistently formed around the lumen. Conclusion The proposed balloon catheter-integrated diffusing applicator can be a feasible minimally invasive device to photothermally treat the obstructive bile ducts. Lasers Surg.

AB  - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2012 and 2013, the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) Vaccination Guidelines Group (VGG) undertook fact-finding visits to several Asian countries, with a view to developing advice for small companion animal practitioners in Asia related to the administration of vaccines to dogs and cats. The VGG met with numerous first opinion practitioners, small animal association leaders, academic veterinarians, government regulators and industry representatives and gathered further information from a survey of almost 700 veterinarians in India, China, Japan and Thailand. Although there were substantial differences in the nature and magnitude of the challenges faced by veterinarians in each country, and also differences in the resources available to meet those challenges, overall, the VGG identified insufficient undergraduate and postgraduate training in small companion animal microbiology, immunology and vaccinology. In most of the countries, there has been little academic research into small animal infectious diseases. This, coupled with insufficient laboratory diagnostic support, has limited the growth of knowledge concerning the prevalence and circulating strains of key infectious agents in most of the countries visited. Asian practitioners continue to recognise clinical infections that are now considered uncommon or rare in western countries. In particular, canine rabies virus infection poses a continuing threat to animal and human health in this region. Both nationally manufactured and international dog and cat vaccines are variably available in the Asian countries, but the product ranges are small and dominated by multi-component vaccines with a licensed duration of immunity (DOI) of only 1 year, or no description of DOI. Asian practitioners are largely unaware of current global trends in small animal vaccinology or of the WSAVA vaccination guidelines. Consequently, most practitioners continue to deliver annual revaccination with both core and non-core vaccines to adult animals, with little understanding that ?herd immunity? is more important than frequent revaccination of individual animals within the population. In this paper, the VGG presents the findings of this project and makes key recommendations for the Asian countries. The VGG recommends that (1) Asian veterinary schools review and increase as needed the amount of instruction in small animal vaccinology within their undergraduate curriculum and increase the availability of pertinent postgraduate education for practitioners; (2) national small animal veterinary associations, industry veterinarians and academic experts work together to improve the scientific evidence base concerning small animal infectious diseases and vaccination in their countries; (3) national small animal veterinary associations take leadership in providing advice to practitioners based on improved local knowledge and global vaccination guidelines; (4) licensing authorities use this enhanced evidence base to inform and support the registration of improved vaccine product ranges for use in their countries, ideally with DOI for core vaccines similar or equal to those of equivalent products available in western countries (i.e. 3 or 4 years). The VGG also endorses the efforts made by Asian governments, non-governmental organisations and veterinary practitioners in working towards the goal of global elimination of canine rabies virus infection. In this paper, the VGG offers both a current pragmatic and future aspirational approach to small animal vaccination in Asia. As part of this project, the VGG delivered continuing education to over 800 Asian practitioners at seven events in four countries. Accompanying this document is a list of 80 frequently asked questions (with answers) that arose during these discussions. The VGG believes that this information will be of particular value to Asian veterinarians as they move towards implementing global trends in small companion animal vaccinology.

AB  - Aim The increased prevalence of non-operative management of splenic injuries contributes to the infrequent use of salvage procedures. Nevertheless, salvage procedures are sometimes required. The study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of our salvage procedure protocol for selected patients. Methods This retrospective study included 27 splenic injury patients divided into two groups: those treated by salvage procedures (splenorrhaphy or partial resection) and those who underwent splenectomy. Our salvage procedure protocol was applied in the following situations: if hemodynamics were stable during laparotomy or bleeding was fully controlled by manual or incisional mobilization of the organ, when no more than two other organs required repair, and if no clinical coagulopathy existed. Results The splenic abbreviated injury scale, intraoperative bleeding, and transfusion requirements of packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma requirements in 24?h were significantly lower in the salvage procedure group. There was no difference in the injury severity score, initial amount of bleeding, length of intensive care unit stay, or morbidity and mortality rates between the groups. Patients who underwent salvage procedures were managed without major complication, except one pseudoaneurysm case. Conclusion We confirmed the feasibility of our salvage procedure protocol for selected patients, particularly for those with simple or lower grade injuries.

AB  - Abstract Recently, it was reported that a plasma-jet could be efficiently applied for the antisepsis of wounds. In this case, the discharge in an argon gas stream was used to produce a so-called ?cold plasma? on the skin surface. The thermal action of the plasma on the skin was investigated in the present study by means of laser scanning microscopy (LSM) and by histological analy-sis. Consequently, the plasma beam was moved with a definite velocity at an optimal distance over the skin surface. The structural changes of the tissue were analyzed. It was found by LSM that a thermal damage could be detected only in the upper cell layers of the stratum corneum (SC) at moving velocities of the plasma beam, usually applied in clinical practice. Deeper parts of the SC were not damaged. The structural changes were so superficial that they could be detected only by LSM but not by analysis of the histological sections.

AB  - Abstract Seventy-five percent of all traumatic brain injuries are mild and do not cause readily visible abnormalities on routine medical imaging making it difficult to predict which individuals will develop unwanted clinical sequelae. Microglia are brain-resident macrophages and early responders to brain insults. Their activation is associated with changes in morphology or expression of phenotypic markers including P2Y12 and major histocompatibility complex class II. Using a murine model of unrestrained mild closed head injury (mCHI), we used microglia as reporters of acute brain injury at sites of impact versus sites experiencing rotational stress 24 h post-mCHI. Consistent with mild injury, a modest 20% reduction in P2Y12 expression was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis but only in the impacted region of the cortex. Furthermore, neither an influx of blood-derived immune cells nor changes in microglial expression of CD45, TREM1, TREM2, major histocompatibility complex class II or CD40 were detected. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), small reductions in T2 weighted values were observed but only near the area of impact and without overt tissue damage (blood deposition, edema). Microglial morphology was quantified without cryosectioning artifacts using ScaleA2 clarified brains from CX3CR1-green fluorescence protein (GFP) mice. The cortex rostral to the mCHI impact site receives greater rotational stress but neither MRI nor molecular markers of microglial activation showed significant changes from shams in this region. However, microglia in this rostral region did display signs of morphologic activation equivalent to that observed in severe CHI. Thus, mCHI-triggered rotational stress is sufficient to cause injuries undetectable by routine MRI that could result in altered microglial surveillance of brain homeostasis. Acute changes in microglial morphology reveal brain responses to unrestrained mild traumatic brain injury In areas subjected to rotational stress distant from impact site In the absence of detectable changes in standard molecular indicators of brain damage, inflammation or microglial activation. That might result in decreased surveillance of brain function and increased susceptibility to subsequent brain insults.

AB  - Tacrolimus (TAC), the mainstay of maintenance immunosuppressive agents, plays a crucial role in new-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT). Previous studies investigating the diabetogenic effects of TAC have focused on the ? cells of islets. In this study, we found that TAC contributed to NODAT through directly affecting hepatic metabolic homeostasis. In mice, TAC-induced hypoglycemia rather than hyperglycemia during starvation via suppressing gluconeogenetic genes, suggesting the limitation of fasting blood glucose in the diagnosis of NODAT. In addition, TAC caused hepatic insulin resistance and triglyceride accumulation through insulin receptor substrate (IRS)2/AKT and sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP1) signaling, respectively. Furthermore, we found a pivotal role of CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2) in TAC-induced metabolic disorders. The restoration of hepatic CRTC2 alleviated the metabolic disorders through its downstream molecules (eg, PCK1, IRS2, and SREBP1). Consistent with the findings from bench, low CRTC2 expression in graft hepatocytes was an independent risk factor for NODAT (odds ratio = 2.692, P = .023, n = 135). Integrating grafts? CRTC2 score into the clinical model could significantly increase the predictive capacity (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.71 vs 0.79, P = .048). Taken together, in addition to its impact on pancreatic cells, TAC induces ?hematogenous diabetes? via CRTC2 signaling. Liver-targeted management may be of help to prevent or heal TAC-associated diabetes.

AB  - Objective The bilateral absence of cortical Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEPs), after cardiac arrest (CA), is a high reliable predictor of poor outcome but it is present in no more than 40% of patients. An amplitude reduction of cortical SEPs was found in about 30% of subjects, but few papers analysed its prognostic significance. The aim of our study is to identify a value of SEP amplitude reduction below which all the CA patients had poor outcome and the relationship between SEP and Electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns. Material and methods We analysed comatose patients in whom SEPs and EEG were recorded at 6-12 hours after CA. We evaluated the sensitivity at specificity of 100% of SEP amplitude in predicting the non-recovery of consciousness by plotting Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. We also analysed the relationship between SEP amplitude and EEG patterns. Outcome was evaluated at 6 months by Glasgow Outcome Scale. Results We analysed 119 subjects. According to the ROC analysis (area under the curve = 0.95/CI 0.91-0.99), all patients with a cortical SEP amplitude <0.65 ?V did not recover consciousness (GOS 1-2), with a sensitivity of 71.8%. Severe EEG abnormalities (suppression and burst-suppression patterns) were also observed in all these patients. Conclusion Not only the absence but also a bilateral amplitude reduction of cortical SEPs (<0.65 ?V) is associated with ominous prognosis (death or non-recovery of consciousness) with a very high predictive value. However, we emphasize that great caution should be applied before adopting amplitude reduction as a criterion for the poor prognosis of CA patients.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI)-induced neurodegeneration leads to irreversible and devastating motor and sensory dysfunction. Post-traumatic outcomes are determined by events occurring during the first 24 hours after SCI. An increase in extracellular glutamate concentration to neurotoxic levels is one of the earliest events after SCI. We used Affymetrix DNA oligonucleotide microarrays (with 1,322 DNA probes) analysis to measure gene expression in order to test the hypothesis that SCI-induced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation triggers significant postinjury transcriptional changes. Here we report that SCI, 1 hour after trauma, induced change in mRNA levels of 165 genes and expression sequence tags (ESTs). SCI affected mRNA levels of those genes that regulate predominantly transcription factors, inflammation, cell survival, and membrane excitability. We also report that NMDA receptor inhibition (with -(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]-cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate [MK-801]) reversed the effect of SCI on about 50% of the SCI-affected mRNAs. Especially interesting is the finding that NMDA receptor activation participates in the up-regulation of inflammatory factors. Therefore, SCI-induced NMDA receptor activation is one of the dominant, early signals after trauma that leads to changes in mRNA levels of a number of genes relevant to recovery processes. The majority of MK-801 effects on the SCI-induced mRNA changes reported here are novel. Additionally, we found that the MK-801 treatment also changed the mRNA levels of 168 genes and ESTs that had not been affected by SCI alone, and that some of their gene products could have harmful effects on SCI outcome. ? 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Porous calcium polyphosphate (CPP) structures proposed as bone-substitute implants and made by sintering CPP powders to form bending test samples of approximately 35 vol % porosity were machined from preformed blocks made either by additive manufacturing (AM) or conventional gravity sintering (CS) methods and the structure and mechanical characteristics of samples so made were compared. AM-made samples displayed higher bending strengths (≈1.2?1.4 times greater than CS-made samples), whereas elastic constant (i.e., effective elastic modulus of the porous structures) that is determined by material elastic modulus and structural geometry of the samples was ≈1.9?2.3 times greater for AM-made samples. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that samples made by either method displayed the same crystal structure forming ?-CPP after sinter annealing. The material elastic modulus, E, determined using nanoindentation tests also showed the same value for both sample types (i.e., E ≈ 64 GPa). Examination of the porous structures indicated that significantly larger sinter necks resulted in the AM-made samples which presumably resulted in the higher mechanical properties. The development of mechanical properties was attributed to the different sinter anneal procedures required to make 35 vol % porous samples by the two methods. A primary objective of the present study, in addition to reporting on bending strength and sample stiffness (elastic constant) characteristics, was to determine why the two processes resulted in the observed mechanical property differences for samples of equivalent volume percentage of porosity. An understanding of the fundamental reason(s) for the observed effect is considered important for developing improved processes for preparation of porous CPP implants as bone substitutes for use in high load-bearing skeletal sites. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Introduction Serum immunoglobulin fractions were evaluated in horses participating in multi-day endurance exercise. Methods Serum IgGa, IgGb, IgG(T), IgA, and IgM were measured using horse-specific ELISA kits in 44 trained horses prior to racing, after each day of racing 50 miles per day and in 15 untrained matched control horses. Data were analyzed via repeated measures ANOVA (P<0.05). Results 44, 18 and 9 horses completed one, two and three days of racing, respectively. Serum IgA before racing (1.97?±?0.14?mg/dL) was similar to controls (1.48?±?0.19) and after one, two or three days of racing (1.98?±?0.13, 1.80?±?0.15 and 1.76?±?0.26). Serum IgM before racing (1.02?±?0.05?mg/dL) was similar to controls (1.08?±?0.12) and after one, two or three days of racing (1.03?±?0.06, 0.91?±?0.08 and 0.89?±?0.11). Serum IgG(T) before racing (6.10?±?0.41?mg/dL) was similar to controls (6.29?±?0.58) and after racing one, two or three days (6.23?±?0.45, 6.62?±?0.63, and 6.65?±?1.34). Serum IgGa was 2.41?±?0.10?mg/dL before racing, and was similar to controls (2.45?±?0.22) and each day of racing (2.58?±?0.14, 2.39?±?0.20, and 2.61?±?0.22, on days one, two and three of racing). Resting serum IgGb concentration was significantly lower in control (5.71?±?0.54?mg/dL) than trained horses (7.65?±?0.41). Conclusions Serum IgGb is higher in trained endurance horses, perhaps reflecting immune stimulation related to disease exposure or more frequent vaccination. Ethical Animal Research All procedures were approved by the Oregon State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Owner informed consent was obtained for all horses in the study.

AB  - Summary A 34-year-old female farmer suffered from localized cutaneous mucormycosis for 17 years. At the first admission, the lesion was a dull red plaque, about 7 x 9 cm in size with ulcerations, surrounded by some nodules on the dorsum of her right hand. General examination did not reveal abnormal findings except the skin lesion. Direct examination of skin scrapings in 10 % KOH revealed broad, sparsely septate, branching hyphae. Histopathology showed many intradermal granulomata and microabscesses as well as mycelial elements comprising broad, distorted, ribbon-like strands. Some of them were phagocytized by multi-nucleated giant cells. Cultures revealed rapidly growing yellow colonies on Sabouraud dextrose agar medium at 25°C. Sporangiophores branched in sympodia and the sporangia were globose, 35?60 ?m in diameter. Their walls were deliquescent, but some of them were rather persistent. Columellae were mostly globose, 12?17 ?m in diameter, up to 35 ?m with collars. Sporangiospores were mainly ellipsoidal, 1.5?2.5 x 3?5 ?m in size, but sometimes highly variable in size and shape. The maximum growth temperature of the isolate was 37°C. The pathogenic organism isolated was tentatively identified as Mucor lusitanicus, which, as far as we know, has not been reported as a causative agent of cutaneous mucormycosis.

AB  - Abstract The date, 7 February 2009, will be known forever in Victoria, Australia as ?Black Saturday?. In the worst bushfires in Australian history, 173 lives were lost. Townships were razed. Over 1800 homes were destroyed, resulting in >?7000 people being made homeless. The provision of health care to the injured, and then to the displaced communities, was provided by a range of health professionals, including paramedics, nurses, and doctors. This is a personal recollection of the related events.

AB  - Abstract Objective The tissue response and biosafety of poly-vinyl-alcohol (PVA) has been investigated to explore its potential use as an agent to straighten pre-curved cochlear implant electrode arrays for surgical insertion. Methods Test arrays were implanted either subcutaneously or into the cochlea of guinea pigs for 3 months. The arrays were uncoated (Treatment 1) or coated with low molecular weight (MW) PVA (Treatment 2), high MW PVA (Treatment 3) or a 50:50 mixture of low and high MW PVA (Treatment 4). After explantation the tissues were examined histologically. Results In both study groups, Treatment 2 dissolved completely and induced the least tissue reaction, while Treatments 3 and 4 not only dissolved incompletely, but also induced more fibrous tissue growth. Treatment 4 coated arrays induced severe insertion trauma in all the cochleas, most likely due to the thickness of the coat and the resulting rigidity of the array. Spiral ganglion cell density (SGCD) in the basal turn of the scala tympani was reduced for both Treatments 2 and 4. While the reduction in SGCD in the Treatment 4 group is likely to be a result of the insertion trauma caused and the subsequent loss of peripheral dendrites, it is unknown what caused the reduction of SGCD in the Treatment 2 group. Conclusion Prior to the specific use of PVA as electrode array coating material, the ideal composition and its biosafety needs to be reassessed. Copyright ? 2005 Whurr Publishers Ltd.
