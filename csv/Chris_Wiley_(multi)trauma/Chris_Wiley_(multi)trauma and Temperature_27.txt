AB  - This study examined the performance of two subjective pain scoring systems for evaluating equine postoperative pain, and investigated differences in pain scoring tendencies of veterinarians and grooms. Fifteen horses were included in the study. Group 1 (n?=?8) had chronic lameness and was admitted for elective arthroscopy under general anaesthesia, on one or two femoropatellar, femorotibial or tibiotarsal joint or digital flexor tendons. The anaesthetic protocol for each horse was similar but not standardized. Multi-modal peri-operative analgesia comprised: romifidine (100?µg?kg?1 IV); flunixin (1.1?mg?kg?1 IV); ketamine (2.2?mg?kg?1 IV); morphine (0.12?mg?kg?1 IV); phenylbutazone (4?mg?kg?1 IV/PO). Group 2 (n?=?7) included pain free controls. At 6?hours post-recovery from anaesthesia (PR) (group 1) or at 20.00?hours (group 2 with one limb bandaged), horses were filmed undisturbed in their stables for 90?seconds (dynamic behaviour, DB); thereafter, the surgery site and pharynx of each horse were palpated (and filmed) in a standardized manner (interactive behaviour, IB). Two observer groups, seven veterinarians and eight grooms, watched video footage of each horse and assigned pain scores using a visual analog scale (VAS) and a numerical rating scale (NRS). Observers assigned a pain score (VAS and NRS) for DB and IB separately and overall. Statistical analysis (Minitab 13.0, Wilcoxon signed rank and Mann?Whitney U-tests) investigated differences in pain scores attributed to groups 1 and 2 horses, compared pain scores assigned by veterinarians and grooms, and examined differences in the performance of VAS and NRS techniques. There were significant differences in the pain scores assigned by veterinarians and grooms to groups 1 and 2 horses. When using DB or IB separately (but not combined) to score perceived pain, grooms assigned higher scores to group 1 than group 2 (U?=?81.5, p?<?0.05; U?=?82.0, p?<?0.05) using the VAS. There was no difference in NRS scores attributed by grooms to groups 1 and 2. Using DB and IB separately or combined, there was no difference in pain scores attributed to groups 1 and 2 by veterinarians using either VAS or NRS scoring systems. Using separate VAS scores for DB (W?=?32.5, p?<?0.05) and IB (W?=?26.5, p?<?0.05) and using combined (DB?+?IB) VAS scores, grooms awarded higher pain scores (W?=?27.0, p?<?0.05) than veterinarians to group 1. Using the NRS, vets and grooms did not score pain differently for group 1. For group 2, grooms scored pain significantly higher than vets when using the VAS to score IB separately (W?=?21.0, p?<?0.05); no other differences between grooms and veterinarians in pain scoring of group 2 (NRS or VAS, DB and IB separately or combined) were identified. The performance of subjective pain scoring systems for assessment of equine postoperative pain varies according to the scale used, the behaviour evaluated (dynamic or interactive) and the observer group. While data suggest that grooms distinguished post-surgery horses from controls more successfully than vets and assigned higher pain scores to these horses, the specific behavioral criteria on which scores were assigned requires future investigation and identification.

AB  - Summary A prospective survey of 528 colic horses, referred to the Large Animal Hospital at the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University of Copenhagen, Denmark, during the period August 1994 to December 1998, was undertaken to develop a predictive model for application in the clinical assessment of prognosis. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, 357 colic cases were used in the elaboration of a simple clinical-practical model consisting of degree of pain, packed cell volume, capillary refill time and rectal temperature. The relationship between rectal temperature and outcome (survival/death) has been regarded as linear. It has also been reported to be nonsignificant. The present study suggests a strong U-shaped relation, which is easily transformed into a linear association and readily interpretable in the clinical situation if treated as a deviation from 38°C. Several other clinical and laboratory variables were strongly related to outcome in the bivariate analysis. The changes in sensitivity and specificity of the multivariate model, when applied as a prognostic test, were presented with changing cut-off values. The cut-off value is the level, of predicted probability of death, at which the clinical decision to treat or subject to euthanasia is taken. The predictive performance of the model was further illustrated using a mortality of 19%. The optimal accurate classification for both survival and death was 87%, which was attained when a cut-off value of 86% was selected. To minimise the number of horses unnecessarily subjected to euthanasia, the cut-off value was increased. However, this simultaneously increased the number of misclassified survivors, i.e. the number of horses that would die despite treatment. Outcome was especially poorly predicted in 4 horses, as was indicated by extreme deviance residuals. In 2 of these horses the large residuals were attributable to sudden and severe changes in the course of disease. All 4 horses had changes in variable values towards abnormality prior to death. Repeated measurements are therefore suggested in order to increase the test performance in general. The prerequisites of clinical application of prognostic models are critically discussed. The main findings of the present study indicate that degree of pain, packed cell volume, capillary refill time and temperature deviation from 38°C, used in a logistic regression model, offer a strong model for clinical assessment of prognosis.

AB  - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a well-known entrapment disease. Recently, many study allowed us to improve our knowledge on CTS. Nevertheless many other topics on this common entrapment are not thoroughly assessed. The Italian CTS Study Group performed a multicenter (11 centers) survey study on more than 500 CTS hands with a large, multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment. We used validated clinical, neurophysiological, and patient-oriented measurements of CTS. In this study we assessed the following issues: 1) It is well known that menopause is related with CTS but no studies evaluated the clinical relationship between the entrapment and the clinical condition. 2) It is still matter of debate if alcohol may be related with CTS. 3) Someone hypothesized that computer pointing devices (mouse and keyboards) may cause CTS. 4) It is well known that patients with CTS complain of partial disability of the hand with frequent falling objects, but no study evaluated this important aspect in daily activity and related with the severity of the disease. Further issues, acquired through the database were assessed. Multi-perspective and multi-measurement assessment, even by using validated patient-oriented tool, provided interesting information confirming and clarifying some poorly studied aspects often observed in CTS patients.

AB  - Summary Two durable, inexpensive and non-invasive sensors for detecting airflow direction and footfall in exercising horses were developed. The airflow sensor measured temperature of the gas at the nostrils using a copper/constantan thermocouple. The response time of the thermocouple unit, the time for the signal to change from 10% to 90% of its final value, was 260 ms in forced air. The tip of the thermocouple was held just inside the false nostril by a small wire frame. The sensor did not interfere with placement of face masks and the addition of the mounting frame slightly decreased response time of the sensor to 208 ms. The footfall sensor was a simple accelerometer, using the contact arm of an electrical relay as a spring/mass unit. Bending of the metal strip was recorded using a strain gauge. The response of the accelerometer was highly under-damped when attached to a rigid surface (resonant frequency 117 Hz, quality factor (Q) 171) but attaching it to the hoof with adhesive foam increased the damping considerably. Both sensors were used in a study of Standardbred horses exercising maximally on a treadmill. Air temperature at the nostril changed from ambient on inspiration to about 35°C on expiration and each leading hoof strike produced a burst of signal from the accelerometer. The sensors may be useful in studies that examine respiration, stride rate and respiratory-locomotor coupling in exercising horses.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with metabolic alterations in various disease states, including major trauma (e.g., burn injury). Metabolic derangements, including muscle insulin resistance and hyperlactatemia, are a clinically significant complication of major trauma. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an essential cofactor for mitochondrial electron transport, and its reduced form acts as a lipophilic antioxidant. Here, we report that burn injury induces impaired muscle insulin signaling, hyperlactatemia, mitochondrial dysfunction (as indicated by suppressed mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates), morphological alterations of the mitochondria (e. g., enlargement, and loss of cristae structure), mitochondrial oxidative stress, and disruption of mitochondrial integrity (as reflected by increased mitochondrial DNA levels in the cytosol and circulation). All of these alterations were significantly alleviated by CoQ10 treatment compared with vehicle alone. These findings indicate that CoQ10 treatment is efficacious in protecting against mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle of burned mice. Our data highlight CoQ10 as a potential new strategy to prevent mitochondrial damage and metabolic dysfunction in burn patients.

We analyzed the conduction values in these hand nerves in healthy volunteers to find any physiological differences between them. Methods: We performed standard conduction studies and conduction velocity distribution (CVD) tests with estimation of 3 quartiles in 31 healthy right-handed volunteers (17 women, 14 men) with a mean age of 44.8?±?15.5?years. Results: The conduction velocities in all quartiles of CVD tests were statistically faster in the ulnar nerve (P?<?0.00001), with no differences in the spread of conduction values and no differences between sides. In the ulnar nerve, CVD velocities in all quartiles were faster in the female group (P?<?0.05). Discussion: The ulnar nerve has more fibers conducting with high velocities than does the median nerve. Electrophysiological comparisons between hand nerves must be performed carefully. Muscle Nerve 59:470?474, 2019

AB  - Summary Background Continuous digital hypothermia can prevent the development and progression of laminitis associated with sepsis but its effects on laminitis due to hyperinsulinaemia are unknown. Objectives To determine the effects of continuous digital hypothermia on laminitis development in the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp model. Study design Randomised, controlled (within subject), blinded, experiment. Methods Eight clinically normal Standardbred horses underwent laminitis induction using the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp model (EHC). At initiation of the EHC, one forelimb was continuously cooled (ICE), with the other maintained at ambient temperature (AMB). Dorsal lamellar sections (proximal, middle, distal) were harvested 48 h after initiation of the EHC and were analysed using histological scoring (0?3) and histomorphometry. Cellular proliferation was quantified by counting epidermal cell nuclei staining positive with an immunohistochemical proliferation marker (TPX2). Results Severe elongation and disruption of SEL with dermo-epidermal separation (score of 3) was observed in all AMB feet at one or more section locations, but was not observed in any ICE sections. Overall 92% of the AMB sections received the most severe histological score (grade 3) and 8% were grade 2, whereas ICE sections were classified as either grade 1 (50%) or grade 2 (50%). Relative to AMB feet, ICE sections were 98% less likely to exhibit grades 2 or 3 (OR: 0.02, 95% CI 0.001, 0.365; P<0.01). Histomorphometry measurements of total and nonkeratinised primary epidermal lamellar length were significantly increased (P<0.01) in AMB limbs compared with ICE. TPX2 positive cell counts were significantly increased (P<0.01) in AMB limbs compared with ICE. Main limitations Continuous digital hypothermia was initiated before recognition of laminitis and therefore the clinical applicability requires further investigation. Conclusions Continuous digital hypothermia reduced the severity of laminitis in the EHC model and prevented histological lesions compatible with lamellar structural failure.

AB  - Introduction Alkalinizing agents have been given to horses before exercise to provide exogenous buffering effects. The objective of this experiment was to determine the intra- and inter-day variability of resting plasma tCO2. The hypothesis was that tCO2 would vary measurably during a multi-day quarantine. Methods Eight acclimated sedentary horses had jugular venous samples collected into 10-ml heparinized evacuated glass tubes 3 times daily (7 AM, 11 AM, and 3 PM) for 5 consecutive days. Horses ate 5.3?kg alfalfa hay at both 7 AM and 3 PM after blood sampling. Plasma tCO2 was determined within 1?3 hours of sampling using an automated chemistry analyzer. Mean tCO2 for all 8 horses was calculated for each of the 15 sampling intervals. Results were compared by Repeated Measures ANOVA. When there was no apparent day-to-day effect, data for all horses were pooled by time-of-day (n?=?40 samples for each of 3 times-of-day) and compared by the Student's t test to determine time-of-day effect. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results Mean tCO2 over the 15 sampling intervals ranged from 28.9-to-31.6?mmol/L and was lower at 11 AM (Day 1) and 3 PM (Days 1, 3, and 4) compared to 7 AM on Day 1 (P<0.05). Individual plasma tCO2 ranged over 4-to-7 units (low 26, high 34, widest range 26?32, narrowest 28?31). Mean pooled tCO2 differed by time-of-day, with 11 AM (30.1?±?0.2, P?=?0.011) and 3 PM (29.8?±?0.2, P<0.001) values lower than 7 AM values (31.0?±?0.2). Conclusions Plasma tCO2 differed significantly by time-of-day with considerable intra- and inter-individual variability.

AB  - Introduction The objective of this study was to provide more information regarding the relationship between heart rate (HR) and performance in show-jumpers. Methods Ten mixed breed horses (9.1?±?1.9?yrs) were assessed at a British Equestrian Federation (BEF) World Class Performance three-day training session. Riders received coaching during warm-up (WU) and after jumping a 15 fence (1.35?1.45?m) course once on day-1, twice on days 2  on day-3 the second round was an 8-fence jump-off. Clinical assessments were performed, and plasma lactate concentrations determined, pre- and post-exercise. Take-off distance (TDF) was determined using high-speed motion capture. The coach graded horse jumping technique (validated methodology). HR was recorded telemetrically from WU until 10?mins post-exercise. Variables were compared using regression procedures/Spearman correlation and paired Students t-test (P<0.05). Results HR was not significantly different between days or consecutive jumping rounds. Mean HR was lower in WU than during the course (127?±?11 vs 136?±?16: P?=?0.027), likely related to increased speed during the course, although HRpeak tended to be higher during WU day- 1 possibly reflecting excitement. Mean HR increased for each quarter during the course. Higher mean course and third-quarter HR were associated with higher blood lactate concentrations (P?=?0.047), greater gluteal and longissimus dorsi muscle spasm on palpation (P<0.01), more faults (P?=?0.044) and lower technique scores (P?=?0.019). TDF was negatively correlated with mean course and third-quarter HR, indicating that closer take-off may be harder work (P<0.01). Conclusions HR increases throughout a jumping course. Higher HRs may be associated with jumping inefficiency and muscle spasm, with potential performance implications for multi-day competitions.

AB  - Abstract Because of their close interaction with neuronal physiology, astrocytes can modulate brain function in multiple ways. Here, we demonstrate a yet unknown astrocytic phenomenon: Astrocytes cultured on microelectrode arrays (MEAs) exhibited extracellular voltage fluctuations in a broad frequency spectrum (100?600 Hz) after electrical stimulation. These aperiodic high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) could last several seconds and did not spread across the MEA. The voltage-gated calcium channel antagonist cilnidipine dose-dependently decreased the power of the oscillations. While intracellular calcium was pivotal, incubation with bafilomycin A1 showed that vesicular release of transmitters played only a minor role in the emergence of HFOs. Gap junctions and volume-regulated anionic channels had just as little functional impact, which was demonstrated by the addition of carbenoxolone (100 ?mol/L) and NPPB (100 ?mol/L). Hyperpolarization with low potassium in the extracellular solution (2 mmol/L) dramatically raised oscillation power. A similar effect was seen when we added extra sodium (+50 mmol/L) or if we replaced it with NMDG+ (50 mmol/L). The purinergic receptor antagonist PPADS suppressed the oscillation power, while the agonist ATP (100 ?mol/L) had only an increasing effect when the bath solution pH was slightly lowered to pH 7.2. From these observations, we conclude that astrocytic voltage oscillations are triggered by activation of voltage-gated calcium channels and driven by a downstream influx of cations through channels that are permeable for large ions such as NMDG+. Most likely candidates are subtypes of pore-forming P2X channels with a low affinity for ATP.

AB  - Objective To test the clinical and sonographic predictors of testicular torsion (TT) with the aim of reducing negative exploration rates. Patients and Methods We performed a prospective study of all boys treated for ?acute scrotum? at our institute between January 2001 and April 2012 and clinical findings were documented. If available, ultrasonography (US) was added to the diagnostic evaluation. A prediction of the diagnosis was based on clinical and sonographic features, and was followed by surgical exploration in all patients. Results A total of 104 patients were included in the 16-month period of the study. No single finding excluded TT. The clinical features (pain <24?h, nausea/vomiting, abnormal cremasteric reflex, high position of the testis) appeared predictive (100% sensitivity) and the clinical scoring system was proven to be reliable, reducing the negative exploration rate by >55%. Ultrasound predictors alone were not able to identify all boys with TT. Conclusions It is safe to refrain from routine surgical exploration in every child with acute scrotum if the clinical score is applied, which results in a marked reduction of negative explorations. A reliable diagnosis could not be obtained based on US alone. As scrotal US is unpleasant for the child, we propose to refrain from this if the clinical score is positive. Patients with a negative clinical score are suitable candidates for US to establish and secure diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract Antimicrobial properties of a long-chain, synthetic, cationic, and hydrophobic amino acid block copolymer are reported. In 5 and 60 min time-kill assays, solutions of K100L40 block copolymers (poly(l-lysine·hydrochloride)100-b-poly(l-leucine)40) at concentrations of 10?100 µg mL?1 show multi-log reductions in colony forming units of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as yeast, including multidrug-resistant strains. Driven by association of hydrophobic segments, K100L40 copolymers form viscous solutions and self-supporting hydrogels in water at concentrations of 1 and 2 wt%, respectively. These K100L40 preparations provide an effective barrier to microbial contamination of wounds, as measured by multi-log decreases of tissue-associated bacteria with deliberate inoculation of porcine skin explants, porcine open wounds, and rodent closed wounds with foreign body. Based on these findings, amino acid copolymers with the features of K100L40 can combine potent, direct antimicrobial activity and barrier properties in one biopolymer for a new approach to prevention of wound infections.

AB  - Although cases of retroperitoneal effusion associated with adrenal gland neoplasia have been reported in the veterinary literature, these clinical reports have been largely anecdotal. To our knowledge, no comprehensive evaluation of the causes or clinical indications of effusion (RPE) in the retroperitoneal space exists. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the causes, presenting signs, clinical findings and outcomes associated with RPE. The records of 23 cats and 44 dogs presenting to the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine between 1996 and 2003 and having been identified with RPE were reviewed. The presence of RPE was identified using abdominal ultrasonography. All of the cats and 84% (n=38) of dogs in this study presented through the Emergency Service. Diagnoses for RPE were categorized as follows: (Group 1) 14 dogs and 3 cats with acute renal failure associated with infection; (Group 2) 5 dogs and 6 cats with acute renal failure of unknown etiology; (Group 3) 3 cats with acute renal failure due to urinary tract obstruction; (Group 4) 8 dogs with adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 5) 7 dogs and 1 cat with non-adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 6) 5 dogs and 4 cats with other renal disease, and (Group 7) 5 dogs and 6 cats with RPF due to other causes. The most frequent presenting complaints in all categories except for those in Group 4 included anorexia, lethargy and vomiting. Physical examination findings were very similar for all categories except for those in Group 4 and included abdominal pain, dehydration, mental depression, lethargy and weakness. For those in Group 4, the most common complaints were collapse or marked weakness, anorexia, lethargy, and discomfort. The physical examination findings for dogs in Group 4 also included collapse or marked weakness, and abdominal distension. Percent mortality for dogs was 39% and, for cats, 43%. In each category, the percent mortalities are as follows (euthanized=e, died=d): Group 1: dogs: 14% (e n=1, d n=1), and cats: 33% (e n=1); Group 2: dogs: 100% (e n=4, d n=1) and cats 67% (e n=4).; Group 3: cats: 100% (e n=2, d n=1); Group 4: dogs: 32% (e n=3); Group 5: dogs: 71% (e n=5) and cats: 0%;. Group 6: dogs: 0% and cats: 25% (e n=1), and Group 7: dogs: 40% (e n=2) and cats: 17% (e n=1). Retroperitoneal effusion, regardless of cause, is associated with significant disease. In people, another category of disease associated with RPE is trauma. Although this category is not included in this study, abdominal ultrasonography of trauma victims may identify a veterinary population with RPE.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study Skin trauma in horses often leads to the development of chronic nonhealing wounds that lack a keratinocyte cover, vital for healing. Reports in mouse and man confirm the possibility of generating functional keratinocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), thus presenting myriad potential applications for wound management or treatment of skin disease. Similarly, differentiation of equine iPSC (eiPSC) into a keratinocyte lineage should provide opportunities for the advancement of veterinary regenerative medicine. Objectives The purpose of this study was to develop an efficient method for the differentiation of eiPSC into a keratinocyte lineage. It was hypothesised that eiPSC can form differentiated keratinocytes (eiPSC-KC) comparable with primary equine keratinocytes (PEK) in their morphological and functional characteristics. Study design Experimental in vitro study. Methods Equine iPSC established using a nonviral system were treated for 30 days with retinoic acid and bone morphogenetic protein-4 to induce directed differentiation into iPSC-KC. Temporospatial gene and protein expression by eiPSC-KC was measured at weekly intervals of differentiation and in response to calcium switch. Proliferative and migratory capacities of eiPSC-KC were compared with those of PEK. Results Equine iPSC, upon directed differentiation, showed loss of pluripotency genes and progressive increase in pancytokeratin expression indicating ectodermal specification into keratinocytes. High differentiation efficiency was achieved, with 82.5% of eiPSC expressing keratin 14, a marker of epidermal-specific basal stem cells, after 30 days of directed differentiation. Moreover, the proliferative capacity of eiPSC-KC was superior, while the migratory capacity (measured as the ability to epithelise in vitro wounds) was comparable with that of PEK. Conclusions This proof of concept study suggests that eiPSC can successfully be differentiated into equine keratinocytes (eiPSC-KC) with features that are promising to the development of a stem cell-based skin construct, with the potential to regenerate lost or damaged skin.

AB  - Abstract Using a spleen autotransplantation model, we conducted hematological, hemorheological, immunological, and morphological studies in mice 6 weeks after splenectomy. Sixty male and female A/J inbred mice were equally divided into 3 groups: 1) SE group, splenectomy was performed; 2) AU group, spleen chips were autotransplanted into the omentum without vascular anastomosis following splenectomy; and 3) C group (controls), no intervention in these mice. At postoperative week 6, the following studies were performed: 1) measurement of hematological parameters; 2) hemorheological studies, including relative cell transit time (RCTT) and fibrinogen levels; and 3) activity of peripheral phagocytes, measured by zymozan-induced chemiluminescence, which was calculated in stimulation index values (SI). In addition, histological investigations of autotransplants were conducted. Erythrocyte mean cell volume and platelet counts, RCTT, fibrinogen levels, and activity of phagocytes were significantly higher in the SE group, compared to those in the C group. In the AU group, these parameters were similar to those in the C group. Morphologically, the transplanted spleen showed normal histology. These data indicate that the transplanted spleens restored their function. We conclude that spleen autotransplantation reserves the normal morphology of spleen and restores most of the spleen's hematological, hemorheological, and immunological functions. Both SI index and erythrocyte deformability can be an informative detection of decreasing splenic function. These data suggest that spleen autotransplantation may provide a useful tool to prevent complications following splenectomy in a clinical setting. Lép autotransplantatios egér modellen a 6. posztoperatív héten haematologiai, haemorheologiai, immunologiai és morphologiai vizsgálatokat végeztünk splenectomiát követ?en. Hatvan A/J inbred egeret 3 egyenl? csoportba osztottunk: 1) SE csoport: splenectomia, 2) AU csoport: splenectomiát követ?en lép-chip autotransplantatio a cseplesz kett?zetébe éranastomosis nélkül, 3) C csoport?control: sebészi beavatkozás nem történt. A 6. posztoperatív héten 1) haematologiai paraméterek meghatározása, 2) a haemorheologiai vizsgálatként a vörösvérsejt deformabilitás mérése (relatív sejttranzit-id?, RCTT), a fibrinogén szint meghatározása történt, 3) immunologiai mérömódszerként a perifériás phagocyták aktivitását zymosan függ? chemiluminescentiával mértük, a stimulációs index (SI) számításával. Párhuzamosan az autotransplantált lép-chipek szövettani értékelését is elvégeztük. Az erythrocyták átlagos térfogata és a thrombocyták száma, az RCTT és a fibrinogén szint, valamint a phagocyták aktivitása szignifikánsan nagyobb volt az SE, mint a C csoportban. Ezek a paraméterek az AU csoportban hasonlóak voltak a C csoport értékeihez. Az autotransplantált lépek normális histologiájú képet mutattak. Eredményeink azt sugallják, hogy a transplantalt lép-chipek funkciója helyreállt. Kísérleteink alapján úgy t?nik, hogy a lép autotransplantatio meg?rzi a lépszövet normál morphologiáját, nagyrészt helyreállítja a haematologiai, haemorheologiai és immunologiai funkciókat. A lépfunkció csökkenésének érzékeny jelz?je lehet az SI és a vörösvérsejt deformabilitás értékeinek változása. Adataink szerint a lépautotransplantatio hatékony eszköz lehet a splenctomiákat követ? komplikációk megel?zésében a klinikai gyakorlatban is. ? 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc. MICROSURGERY 23:483?488 2003

AB  - An 11-month-old Border collie presented collapsed and continued to deteriorate rapidly despite supportive treatment. The dog had a history of failure to thrive and recurring respiratory infection. Laboratory abnormalities included neutrophilic leucocytosis, Heinz body anaemia, hyperammonaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia, proteinuria and hypocobalaminaemia. Post-mortem examination revealed multi-focal necrosis within the heart, kidneys, pancreas, liver, meninges and cerebral cortex. Fungal hyphae in lesions were identified as Scedosporium prolificans following culture. Subsequent genotyping confirmed that the dog carried the CUBN:c.8392delC mutation in a homozygous state, verifying hereditary cobalamin deficiency (a.k.a. Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome). Cobalamin deficiency may have been a predisposing factor for the development of systemic fungal infection in this dog.

AB  - Objectives: To analyse the demographic information of dogs referred for investigation of fever, to determine the usefulness of various diagnostic investigations and to assess the effect of treatment before referral on the presence of fever at referral, the duration of the investigation and the ability to reach a final diagnosis. Methods: The clinical records of 66 dogs, in which fever was part of the clinical signs documented by the referring veterinary surgeon, were reviewed. The effects of treatment 24 hours before referral on temperature at initial consultation and on time to diagnosis were evaluated. The effect of body temperature at initial consultation on cost and on time to diagnosis was also determined. The effect of insurance on costs incurred was assessed. The utility of different diagnostic investigations was recorded, and cases were classified according to the final diagnosis. Results: Only 34·8 per cent of dogs were diagnosed with immune-mediated disease, with most frequent diagnoses being steroid-responsive meningitis and polyarthritis. Treatment 24 hours before referral significantly increased the time to diagnosis (P=0·004) and affected the presence of fever at referral (P=0·006). Insurance status did not significantly affect cost incurred by the owner. Clinical Significance: This study documents a high incidence of immune-mediated disease in dogs referred for investigation of fever. It also documents a higher incidence of inflammatory central nervous system disease in febrile dogs than that reported previously. Of the diagnostic modalities employed in the majority of cases, radiography, cytology and bacteriological and fungal cultures (fluids/tissues) were the most useful. It is suggested that treatment is withdrawn or withheld before commencing diagnostic investigation of fever.

AB  - Abstract Background. Peritoneal adhesion is a common complication following abdominal surgery. Despite recent advances in diagnosis and treatment, it still presents a problem for the patients and surgeons. In the present study, we investigated the effects of octenidindihydro-chloride ? phenoxyethanol (OCP) on peritoneal adhesions. Method. Rats were divided into four groups: Group 1 (saline), Group 2 (peritonitis plus saline), Group 3 (OCP), and Group 4 (peritonitis plus OCP). Peritonitis was induced in the rats of Groups 2 and 4. The abdominal cavities of the rats in Groups 1 and 2 were washed with saline, while those of the rats in Groups 3 and 4 were irrigated with 1:10 OCP solution. Adhesion and fibrotic scores were determined by re-laparotomy after 21 days. Results. The adhesion scores in Groups 1 (saline), 2 (peritonitis plus saline), 3 (OCP) and 4 (peritonitis plus OCP) were 3.30±0.94, 5.25±1.03, 1.12±0.83 and 0.28±0.48, respectively. Statistical analysis of adhesion scores revealed significant differences between groups, except between Groups 3 and 4 (p = 0.265). Statistical analyses of grades of histopathological signs showed that Group 1 differed from Groups 2 and 4 (p = 0.004, p = 0.003, respectively); Group 2 differed from Groups 3 and 4 (p = 0.001, p = 0.001, respectively). On the other hand, differences between Group 3 and Groups 1 and 4 were not significant (p = 0.06, p = 0.08, respectively). Conclusion. OCP decreased the peritoneal adhesion formation macroscopically and microscopically in the presence or absence of peritonitis. Peritoneal defects due to trauma are to be left open and OCP diluted 1:1 should not be used intraperitoneally.

AB  - Abstract Background information Continued advances in stem cell biology and stem cell transplantation rely on non-invasive biomarkers to characterise cells and stem cell aggregates. The non-invasive quality of such biomarkers is essential because exogenous labels, probes or reporters can unintentionally and dramatically alter stem cell state as can disruption of cell?cell and cell?matrix interactions. Here, we investigate the utility of the autofluorescent metabolite, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), as a non-invasive, intrinsic biomarker of cell death when detected with multi-photon optical-based approaches. To test this possibility, cell death was induced in murine embryoid bodies (EBs) at an early stage (day 3) of differentiation using staurosporine, an ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor of electron transport. Several hours after staurosporine treatment, EBs were stained with a single-colour, live/dead probe. A single-cross-sectional plane of each EB was imaged to detect the fluorescence intensity of the live/dead probe (extrinsic fluorescence) as well as the fluorescence intensity of NADH (intrinsic fluorescence). EBs were assessed at subsequent time points (days 6?12) for the formation of beating areas as an indicator of functional differentiation. Results Statistical comparison indicated a strong positive correlation between extrinsic fluorescence intensity of the live/dead stain and intrinsic fluorescence of NADH, suggesting that the intensity of NADH fluorescence could be used to reliably and non-invasively assess death of cells of EBs. Furthermore, EBs that had high levels of cell death soon after aggregate formation had limited ability to give rise to functional cardiomyocytes at later time points. Conclusions We demonstrate the utility of NADH fluorescence intensity as a non-invasive indicator of cell death in stem cell aggregates when measured using multi-photon excitation. In addition, we show that the degree of stem cell death at early stages of differentiation is predictive for the formation of functional cardiomyocytes.
