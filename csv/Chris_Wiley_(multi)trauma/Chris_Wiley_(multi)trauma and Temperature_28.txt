AB  - Key points We have developed a novel porcine model of high-thoracic midline contusion spinal cord injury (SCI) at the T2 spinal level. We describe this model and the ensuing cardiovascular and neurohormonal responses, and demonstrate the model is efficacious for studying clinically relevant cardiovascular dysfunction post-SCI. We demonstrate that the high-thoracic SCI model, but not a low-thoracic SCI model, induces persistent hypotension along with a gradual reduction in plasma noradrenaline and increases in plasma aldosterone and angiotensin II. We additionally conducted a proof-of-concept long-term (12 weeks) survival study in animals with T2 contusion SCI demonstrating the potential utility of this model for not only acute experimentation but also long-term drug studies prior to translation to the clinic. Abstract Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the spinal cord injury (SCI) population, especially in those with high-thoracic or cervical SCI. With this in mind, we aimed to develop a large animal (porcine) model of high-thoracic (T2 level) contusion SCI and compare the haemodynamic and neurohormonal responses of this injury against a low-thoracic (T10 level) model. Ten Yorkshire pigs were randomly subjected to 20 cm weight drop contusion SCI at either the T2 or the T10 spinal level. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were continuously monitored until 4 h post-SCI. Plasma noradrenaline (NA), aldosterone and angiotensin II (ANGII) were measured pre-SCI and at 30, 60, 120 and 240 min post-SCI. Additionally, two Yucatan pigs were subjected to T2-SCI and survived up to 12 weeks post-injury to demonstrate the efficacy of this model for long-term survival studies. Immediately after T2-SCI, SBP, MAP and HR increased (P < 0.0001). Between decompression (5 min post-SCI) and 30 min post-decompression in T2-SCI, SBP and MAP were lower than pre-SCI (P < 0.038). At 3 and 4 h after T2-SCI, SBP remained lower than pre-SCI (P = 0.048). After T10-SCI, haemodynamic indices remained largely unaffected. Plasma NA was lower in T2- vs. T10-SCI post-SCI, whilst aldosterone and ANGII were higher. Both chronically injured pigs demonstrated a vast reduction in SBP at 12 weeks post-SCI. Our model of T2-SCI causes a rapid and sustained alteration in neurohormonal control and cardiovascular function, which does not occur in the T10 model.

AB  - Abstract Background. Peritoneal adhesion is a common complication following abdominal surgery. Despite recent advances in diagnosis and treatment, it still presents a problem for the patients and surgeons. In the present study, we investigated the effects of octenidindihydro-chloride ? phenoxyethanol (OCP) on peritoneal adhesions. Method. Rats were divided into four groups: Group 1 (saline), Group 2 (peritonitis plus saline), Group 3 (OCP), and Group 4 (peritonitis plus OCP). Peritonitis was induced in the rats of Groups 2 and 4. The abdominal cavities of the rats in Groups 1 and 2 were washed with saline, while those of the rats in Groups 3 and 4 were irrigated with 1:10 OCP solution. Adhesion and fibrotic scores were determined by re-laparotomy after 21 days. Results. The adhesion scores in Groups 1 (saline), 2 (peritonitis plus saline), 3 (OCP) and 4 (peritonitis plus OCP) were 3.30±0.94, 5.25±1.03, 1.12±0.83 and 0.28±0.48, respectively. Statistical analysis of adhesion scores revealed significant differences between groups, except between Groups 3 and 4 (p = 0.265). Statistical analyses of grades of histopathological signs showed that Group 1 differed from Groups 2 and 4 (p = 0.004, p = 0.003, respectively); Group 2 differed from Groups 3 and 4 (p = 0.001, p = 0.001, respectively). On the other hand, differences between Group 3 and Groups 1 and 4 were not significant (p = 0.06, p = 0.08, respectively). Conclusion. OCP decreased the peritoneal adhesion formation macroscopically and microscopically in the presence or absence of peritonitis. Peritoneal defects due to trauma are to be left open and OCP diluted 1:1 should not be used intraperitoneally.

AB  - Abstract Tissue approximation and repair are conventionally performed with sutures and staples, but these means are inherently traumatic. Tissue approximation using laser-responsive nanomaterials can lead to rapid tissue sealing and repair, and is an attractive alternative to existing clinical methods. Here, the use of laser-activated nanosealants (LANS) with gold nanorods (GNRs) embedded in silk fibroin polypeptide matrices is demonstrated. The adaptability of LANS for sealing soft tissues is demonstrated using two different modalities: insoluble thin films for internal, intestinal tissue repair, and semisoluble pastes for external repair, shown by skin repair in live mice. Laser repaired intestinal tissue held over seven times more fluid pressure than sutured intestine and also prevented bacterial leakage. Skin incisions in mice closed using LANS' showed indication of increased mechanical strength and faster repair compared to suturing. Laser-activated silk-GNR nanosealants rapidly seal soft-tissue tears and show high promise for tissue approximation and repair in trauma and routine surgery.

AB  - Abstract The reproductive ecology of Mohave rattlesnakes Crotalus scutulatus was investigated in the western Mohave Desert using radiotelemetry from August 2001 to November 2004. This paper documents reproductive behavior across successive seasons in the context of seasonal timing, mean daily movement, home range, body temperature and relationship with abiotic factors such as time of day, temperature, precipitation, photoperiod and microhabitat. This population of C. scutulatus used a bimodal mating system, with reproductive behavior occurring in late summer/fall (21 August to 7 October), interrupted by 4?months of cold weather, and concluding in the spring (16 March to 16 May). Drought apparently curtailed courtship and copulation during the 2002 activity season, but the pregnancy rates in 2002 and 2003 were not significantly affected. Communal denning was not detected and there was no indication of seasonal migration. Autumnal and vernal movements appeared to be driven by reproductive effort, predominantly males engaged in prolonged mate searching. Sexual maturity was achieved at 2.0?years/600?mm snout?vent length (SVL) for females, and 1.5?years/400?mm SVL for males.

AB  - Abstract Background Adult primary mesenchymal cells of different origin which can be obtained with minor donor site morbidity are considered for articular cartilage repair. This study aims at a comparison of their chondrogenic potential. Methods Mesenchymal cells were isolated from perichondrium/periosteum, bone marrow or fat of adult rats and found to be positive for the stem-cell-related antigens Sca-1, c-Kit, CD10, CD13 and CD90 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Chondrogenic differentiation was induced by applying recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) or adenoviral vectors carrying BMP-2 cDNA, followed by micromass culture. The stimulated cells were characterized by RT-PCR, cell proliferation and apoptosis assays. Expression of aggrecan, collagen type I, II, IX and X and alkaline phosphatase genes was analyzed by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry in comparison with unstimulated control cells. Adenovirally stimulated cells were transplanted into mechanically generated partial-thickness cartilage lesions in the patellar groove of the rat femur. Quality and integration of the repair tissues were assessed by histochemical and immunohistochemical methods. Results Stimulation with BMP-2 or AdBMP-2 led to an up-regulation of cartilage-specific gene expression in all three cell populations studied, most rapidly and prominently in the perichondrial/periosteal cells, which showed a 3200-fold increase of type II collagen mRNA and reached the highest absolute levels of type II and IX collagen transcripts after stimulation. Similar results were obtained for the bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC), while the respective transcript levels in fat stromal cells declined after an initial more than 30-fold elevation. Following transplantation in vivo, AdBMP-2-infected perichondrial/periosteal cells produced a proteoglycan-rich, type II collagen-positive matrix with only faint staining for type I collagen. The repair tissue originating from AdBMP-2-infected BMSC showed less intense type II collagen staining, but a relatively proteoglycan-rich matrix, weakly positive for type I collagen. Transgene-activated fat stromal cells formed rather fibrous tissue mainly composed of type I collagen. Unstimulated cells of the three different populations gave only rise to fibrous tissue. Conclusions Perichondrium/periosteum-derived cells and BMSC seem superior to cells isolated from fat with respect to forming hyaline cartilaginous tissue. A chondrogenic stimulus, e.g. by transfer of BMP-2 cDNA, appears to be required for initiation and support of chondrogenic differentiation. Copyright ? 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Chemical analyses of brain interstitial fluid can reveal important information about local brain metabolism and neurochemistry, and can enhance our understanding of how neuronal networks respond to physiological or pathological stimuli. Among brain monitoring methods currently available, microelectrode biosensors provide real-time analyses with high temporal resolution and minimal perturbation to living tissue by using oxidase enzymes for biological recognition. Two types of microelectrodes are used: cylindrically shaped wire electrodes provide the smallest implantable devices to date, and microfabricated multi-electrode needles can monitor several molecules simultaneously. They have already contributed significantly to our understanding of brain energy metabolism with glucose and lactate detection, and to neurotransmitter systems with glutamate, D-serine, acetylcholine, and purine detection. They have the potential to undergo further technological developments in future studies.

AB  - Synopsis Bacillus cereus is ubiquitous in nature and thus occurs naturally in a wide range of raw materials and foodstuffs. B. cereus spores are resistant to desiccation and heat and able to survive dry storage and cooking. Vegetative cells produce several toxins which on ingestion in sufficient numbers can cause vomiting and/or diarrhoea depending on the toxins produced. Gastrointestinal disease is commonly associated with reheated or inadequately cooked foods. In addition to being a rare cause of several acute infections (e.g. pneumonia and septicaemia), B. cereus can also cause localized infection of post-surgical or trauma wounds and is a rare but significant pathogen of the eye where it may result in severe endophthalmitis often leading to loss of vision. Key risk factors in such cases are trauma to the eye and retained contaminated intraocular foreign bodies. In addition, rare cases of B. cereus-associated keratitis (inflammation of the cornea) have been linked to contact lens use. Bacillus cereus is therefore a microbial contaminant that could adversely affect product safety of cosmetic and facial toiletries and pose a threat to the user if other key risk factors are also present. The infective dose in the human eye is unknown, but as few as 100 cfu has been reported to initiate infection in a susceptible animal model. However, we are not aware of any reports in the literature of B. cereus infections in any body site linked with use of personal care products. Low levels of B. cereus spores may on occasion be present in near-eye cosmetics, and these products have been used by consumers for many years. In addition, exposure to B. cereus is more likely to occur through other routes (e.g. dustborne contamination) due to its ubiquity and resistance properties of spores. The organism has been recovered from the eyes of healthy individuals. Therefore, although there may be a perceived hazard, the risk of severe eye infections as a consequence of exposure through contaminated near-eye cosmetics is judged to be vanishingly small. It is unlikely that more stringent microbiological standards for near-eye cosmetics will have any impact on the risk of severe eye infections caused by B. cereus, as these are not linked to use of personal care products.

AB  - Abstract Although calpain (EC 3.4.22) protease activation was suggested to contribute to excitotoxic delayed calcium deregulation (DCD) via proteolysis of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger 3 (NCX3), cytoplasmic calpain activation in relation to DCD has never been visualized in real-time. We employed a calpain fluorescence resonance energy transfer substrate to simultaneously image calpain activation and calcium deregulation in live cortical neurons. A calpain inhibitor-sensitive decline in fluorescence resonance energy transfer was observed at 39?± 5?min after the occurrence of DCD in neurons exposed to continuous glutamate (100??M). Inhibition of calpain by calpeptin did not delay the onset of DCD, recovery from DCD-like reversible calcium elevations, or cell death despite inhibiting α-spectrin processing by >?90%. NCXs reversed during glutamate exposure, the NCX antagonist KB-R7943 prolonged the time to DCD, and significant NCX3 cleavage following 90?min of glutamate exposure was not observed. Our findings suggest that robust calpain activation associated with acute glutamate toxicity occurs only after a sustained loss in calcium homeostasis. Processing of NCX3 or other calpain substrates is unlikely to be the primary cause of acute excitotoxicity in cortical neurons. However, a role for calpain as a contributing factor or in response to milder glutamate insults is not excluded.

AB  - Abstract Periprosthetic joint infection is among the most common and severe complications in total joint arthroplasty. Today, a combination of different methods is used for diagnosis because no single method with sufficient sensitivity and specificity is available. In this study, we explored the usability of single-molecule microscopy to characterize synovial fluid samples from periprosthetic joint infections. Patients (n?=?27) that needed revision arthroplasty underwent the routine diagnostic procedures for periprosthetic joint infection of the University Hospital in Bonn. Additionally, the diffusion rate of two probes, dextran and hyaluronan, was measured in small volumes of periprosthetic synovial fluid samples using single-molecule microscopy. To evaluate the suitability of single-molecule microscopy to detect PJI the AUC for both markers was calculated. The diffusion rate of hyaluronan in periprosthetic synovial fluid from patients with septic loosening was faster than in samples from patients with aseptic loosening. Single-molecule microscopy showed excellent diagnostic performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93, and allowed the detection of periprosthetic joint infection in patients that would be challenging to diagnose with current methods. For the first time, single-molecule microscopy was used to detect periprosthetic joint infection. Our results are encouraging to study the value of single-molecule microscopy in a larger patient cohort. The speed and accuracy of single-molecule microscopy can be used to further characterize synovial fluid, potentially allowing intraoperative diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infections in the future.

AB  - Summary Prehospital ultrasound is an increasingly pertinent area of focus for EMS providers worldwide. Bedside ultrasound application in the hospital has foreseeable benefits when transferred to an out-of-hospital environment, in a multitude of scenarios. Non-physicians have successfully demonstrated the ability to perform focused ultrasound exams. However, educational criteria for non-physician users, standardized competency evaluations, standardized ultrasound-in-the-field algorithms, and outcomes data for prehospital use need to be established. There is a large potential for research and future development of ultrasound within EMS on a global scale.

AB  - Summary Post-traumatic splenectomy is associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality and long-term impairment of humoral and cellular immunity. Alternatives to surgery have been developed to minimize or avoid the immediate and/or long-term complications of splenectomy. Herein we investigated the long-term effect of non-operative management (NOM) of the traumatic rupture of the spleen on the distribution of peripheral blood (PB) lymphocyte populations and cytokine production by T cells. PB samples were drawn from six NOM patients, 13 age-matched adults who had undergone splenectomy after trauma (SP patients) and 31 age-matched controls. Cellular phenotypes and the intracellular production of interferon (IFN)-?, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4 and IL-10 cytokines in T cells were determined in whole blood?±?mitogens by flow cytometry. NOM patients did not show any changes in the absolute numbers of lymphocytes or the distribution of their subsets, compared to the controls. In contrast, SP patients showed a sustained increase in the percentage and/or absolute numbers of lymphocytes, CD8 T cells, activated CD8 T cells, natural killer (NK)?T cells, NK cells and ?δ T cells, and a reduction in naive CD4 T cells. The constitutive or induced cytokine production by T cells of the NOM group was similar to the control group, whereas SP patients had increased percentages of constitutive IL-2- and IFN-?-producing CD8 T cells and IFN-?-producing CD4 T cells. Our findings indicate collectively that the healing process in NOM does not affect the architecture of the spleen to such an extent that it would lead to long-term alterations of the proportions of PB lymphocytes or the T cell cytokine profiles.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aim? A major problem in assessing the true public health impact of drug-use on driving and overall traffic safety is that the variables being measured across studies vary significantly. In studies reported in a growing global literature, basic parameters assessed, analytical techniques and drugs tested are simply not comparable due to lack of standardization in the field. These shortcomings severely limit the value of this research to add knowledge to the field. A set of standards to harmonize research findings is sorely needed. This project was initiated by several international organizations to develop guidelines for research on drugged driving. Methods? A September 2006 meeting of international experts discussed the harmonization of protocols for future research on drugged driving. The principal objective of the meeting was to develop a consensus report setting guidelines, standards, core data variables and other controls that would form the basis for future international research. A modified Delphi method was utilized to develop draft guidelines. Subsequently, these draft guidelines were posted on the internet for global review, and comments received were integrated into the final document. Results? The Guidelines Document is divided into three major sections, each focusing upon different aspects of drugged driving research (e.g. roadside surveys, prevalence studies, hospital studies, fatality and crash investigations, etc.) within the critical issue areas of ?behavior?, ?epidemiology? and ?toxicology?. The behavioral section contains 32 specific recommendations; (2) epidemiology 40 recommendations; and (3) toxicology 64 recommendations. Conclusions? It is anticipated that these guidelines will improve significantly the overall quality of drugged driving research and facilitate future cross-study comparisons nationally and globally.

AB  - Introduction Swedish Standardbred trotters are usually not clipped during the cold season but routinely showered and blanketed after exercise. Yet, the effects on heat dissipation have not been thoroughly studied. Methods Six Standardbred geldings were tested during three consecutive days, acting as their own control when: 1) showered, 2) showered and blanketed, 3) neither showered nor blanketed. The exercise consisted of 20?min trot (maximum heart rate 172?bpm), preceded and followed by 5?min walk. Rectal- (RT) and skin temperature (ST), respiration rate (RR) and heart rate (HR) were recorded: before exercise in the horses? boxes, after harnessing, after 5?min walk, at stops during four sequences of low and high intensity trotting, after 5?min walk (stable aisle), after showering and blanketing and at intervals of 15?30?min during recovery in boxes until one hour after exercise. Blankets remained on horses until test completion. Results Data were analyzed with Proc Mixed Model in SAS. Ambient temperature was 7.2?±?0.2°C (relative humidity 63.5?±?1.0%) in the stable and 1.0?±?1.0°C (54.3?±?1.2%) outdoors. Showering decreased ST of the neck (mean?±?SE, 32.0?±?0.4°C) compared to when horses were not showered (35.1?±?0.4, P<0.05). Showering also decreased ST of the hind leg (31.4?±?0.5, P<0.05). RT, RR and HR did not differ between treatments (P>0.05). Conclusions In conclusion, showering is efficient for cooling down whereas blanketing compromised heat dissipation.

AB  - Summary Vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) is a developing field for the reconstruction of multi-tissue defects unable to be ameliorated with autologous tissue. Thus far, over 90 patients have received a VCA worldwide. Although individual immunosuppression regimens vary, most patients are maintained on multi-drug regimens. As anticipated, metabolic, infectious, oncologic, and psychosocial complications have been reported in VCA recipients. The relatively few number of cases performed to date and the absence of uniformity in the reporting of results hinder the establishment of the long-term outcomes of VCAs. This chapter aims to review the reported outcomes and highlight the ongoing challenges and opportunities available in this emerging field of transplantation.

AB  - Abstract Global temperatures are rising; extreme environmental heat can result in adverse health effects including heatstroke. Acute effects of heat are well recognised, but there is less understanding of potential long-term adverse outcomes. Our aim was to review recent medical literature for clinical cases of environmental heatstroke with a focus on neurological outcome. Structured search strategies were designed to retrieve publications of heatstroke case reports using Ovid Medline and Embase (2000?2016). One thousand and forty-nine abstracts were identified, and after application of exclusion criteria 71 articles deemed relevant. Ninety cases were identified from 71 articles. 100% presented with acute neurological symptoms; 87.8% presented with non-neurological symptoms. 44.4% patients recovered fully, 23.3% died, 23.3% suffered convalescent or long-term neurological sequelae, and in 8.9% no long-term follow up was available. 57.1% of the patients who died or had a neurological deficit had no documented co-morbidity. Patterns of neurological deficits included 66.7% patients with motor dysfunction, 9.5% cognitive impairment, 19% both motor and cognitive impairment and 4.7% other. In total 71.4% of the impaired patients had long-term cerebellar dysfunction. Adverse long-term neurological outcomes were common in surviving patients presenting with environmental heatstroke. Permanent neurological deficits were present in 34.4% of survivors where outcome was known; many were young, healthy individuals. Cerebellar injury was common suggesting cerebellar structures are vulnerable to heat. These findings highlight that people of all ages and pre-morbid states are at risk of severe heat-related illness. In the face of climate change, effective interventions for heat-related illness, including both treatment and prevention are necessary.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the cardiovascular and thoracic surgery. Cardiopulmonary bypass may be indicated for extreme cases in patients with massive anterior mediastinal masses, but resection of this mass without prior tissue diagnosis would not be an appropriate therapeutic strategy. Cardiopulmonary bypass is rarely necessary for management of lung injury. The requirement for high-dose anticoagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass would present prohibitive risk and would likely be associated with a dismal neurological outcome. All patients undergoing intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) treatment must be assessed with frequent neurovascular examinations. Benign etiologies include superior vena cava (SVC) thrombosis, mediastinal fibrosis, and complications of intravascular devices and catheters. Several operative techniques have been described for damage control of thoracotomy to control hemorrhage and decrease operative time and transfusion requirements, as well as improving survival.
