AB  - Abstract Global temperatures are rising; extreme environmental heat can result in adverse health effects including heatstroke. Acute effects of heat are well recognised, but there is less understanding of potential long-term adverse outcomes. Our aim was to review recent medical literature for clinical cases of environmental heatstroke with a focus on neurological outcome. Structured search strategies were designed to retrieve publications of heatstroke case reports using Ovid Medline and Embase (2000?2016). One thousand and forty-nine abstracts were identified, and after application of exclusion criteria 71 articles deemed relevant. Ninety cases were identified from 71 articles. 100% presented with acute neurological symptoms; 87.8% presented with non-neurological symptoms. 44.4% patients recovered fully, 23.3% died, 23.3% suffered convalescent or long-term neurological sequelae, and in 8.9% no long-term follow up was available. 57.1% of the patients who died or had a neurological deficit had no documented co-morbidity. Patterns of neurological deficits included 66.7% patients with motor dysfunction, 9.5% cognitive impairment, 19% both motor and cognitive impairment and 4.7% other. In total 71.4% of the impaired patients had long-term cerebellar dysfunction. Adverse long-term neurological outcomes were common in surviving patients presenting with environmental heatstroke. Permanent neurological deficits were present in 34.4% of survivors where outcome was known; many were young, healthy individuals. Cerebellar injury was common suggesting cerebellar structures are vulnerable to heat. These findings highlight that people of all ages and pre-morbid states are at risk of severe heat-related illness. In the face of climate change, effective interventions for heat-related illness, including both treatment and prevention are necessary.

AB  - A 43-year-old female with progressive systemic sclerosis developed painful subcutaneous nodules proximally on her extremities which spread distally to her shins. Initially tender, they became red and evolved to painless, red-brown nodules. She had been taking penicillamine for 19 months and was on no other medication or supplements. History and physical exam revealed no evidence of infection, trauma, injection, or significant travel. Incisional biopsy of an acute nodule demonstrated septal panniculitis, with extensive lipomembranous change, and an associated brisk granulomatous infiltrate with multinucleated foreign-body like giant cells. Deeper adipose tissue demonstrated fibrosed thickened septae with an inflammatory cell infiltrate, consistent with scleroderma profundus. Further studies revealed no infectious organisms, or refractile material. The lesions cleared 3 weeks after stopping penicillamine. She declined a re-challenge and has been disease free for a year. Lipomembranous fat changes are identified in about 5% of subcutaneous inflammatory disorders; most frequently in venous insufficiency, and also with morphea, lupus pannicultis, erythema nodosum, necrobiosis lipoidica and trauma. Panniculitis with lipomembranous fat changes similar to this case has been reported in a patient with systemic sclerosis on norethisterone acetate. This is a rare and interesting case of penicillamine-induced panniculitis.

AB  - Abstract Elevated intraocular pressure may lead to retinal ganglion cell injury and consequent visual deficits. Chronic intraocular pressure increase is a major risk factor for glaucoma, a leading blinding disease, and permanent visual deficits can also occur following acute pressure increments due to trauma, acute glaucoma or refractive surgery. How pressure affects retinal neurons is not firmly established. Mechanical damage at the optic nerve head, reduced blood supply, inflammation and cytotoxic factors have all been called into play. Reasoning that the analysis of retinal neurons soon after pressure elevation would provide useful cues, we imaged individual ganglion cells in isolated rat retinas before and after short hydrostatic pressure increments. We found that slowly rising pressure to peaks observed in trauma, acute glaucoma or refractive surgery (50?90?mmHg) did not damage ganglion cells, whereas a rapid 1?min pulse to 50?mmHg injured 30% of these cells within 1?h. The severity of damage and the number of affected cells increased with stronger or repeated insults. Degrading extracellular ATP or blocking the P2X receptors for ATP prevented acute pressure-induced damage in ganglion cells. Similar effects were observed in?vivo. A short intraocular pressure transient increased extracellular ATP levels in the eye fluids and damaged ganglion cells within 1?h. Reducing extracellular ATP in the eye prevented damage to ganglion cells and accelerated recovery of their response to light. These data show that rapid pressure transients induce acute ganglion cell injury and unveil the causal role of extracellular ATP elevation in such injury.

AB  - Abstract A comprehensive survey is provided on the application of a random positioning machine (RPM) for studies on gravitational effects on mammalian cells. The RPM is suitable to simulate microgravity conditions and allows performing a high number of on-ground experiments wherein mammalian cells are exposed to reduced gravity. Most of these experiments have been performed either to prove or extend observations made during spaceflights or to develop and prepare new spaceflight experiments. They did not only bring a tremendous number of observations, but they helped to elucidate three dominant cellular pathways that are affected by weightlessness. The apoptotic, the immune-activating and the bone differentiation pathways are discussed.

AB  - We describe a case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma with features overlapping between the myofibromatosis and the myopericytoma type. The patient is a 58-year-old female with a painless plaque-like and multinodular lesion in the pretibial dermis. She reported repeated trauma to this site, first in her early youth that left an area of hyperpigmentation, and then again at age 40. She had noticed the appearance of nodules in this area 5 years prior to presentation, which had increased in size and number over the last six months. The biopsy showed a biphasic pattern with a myofibromatosis type component composed of spindle cell myoid nodules and more cellular round cell areas. The myopericytoma-like areas appeared to be infiltrating along vessels. These areas contained aggregates of immature cells arranged concentrically around vascular lumina reminiscent of pericytes. Immunohistochemical stains showed focal positivity for smooth muscle actin. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies have shown these pericyte-like cells to be of a myoid origin. The reason for the neoplastic proliferation of perivascular myoid cells is presently unknown. The association of trauma and neoplastic transformation of the skin is rare. We report the first case of a cutaneous perivascular myoma arising in a chronic scar.

AB  - Summary This chapter addresses the nature of disability, how it can best be ameliorated, which training techniques and medical treatments are most effective, particularly after single incident brain injury, and the organisational structures required for their optimal delivery. A holistic biopsychosocial individualised multi-dimensional rehabilitation programme includes: reiterative multi-disciplinary assessment, problem definition and measurement, goal-setting and treatment planning, treatment delivery, evaluation of effectiveness, and reassessment with a view to further treatment. Non-invasive therapy interventions and task-related training in the context of neural damage are an integral part of the rehabilitation process after a neurological event, and aim to optimise a person's functional ability. Cardio-respiratory training and exercise classes may reverse the detraining effects of immobility and reduced activity seen in many chronic conditions. Symptoms related to neurological impairments caused by either single incident or chronic progressive conditions can cause distress and impact on function.

AB  - Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that enhances image contrast by using the susceptibility differences between tissues. It is created by combining both magnitude and phase in the gradient echo data. SWI is sensitive to both paramagnetic and diamagnetic substances which generate different phase shift in MRI data. SWI images can be displayed as a minimum intensity projection that provides high resolution delineation of the cerebral venous architecture, a feature that is not available in other MRI techniques. As such, SWI has been widely applied to diagnose various venous abnormalities. SWI is especially sensitive to deoxygenated blood and intracranial mineral deposition and, for that reason, has been applied to image various pathologies including intracranial hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, stroke, neoplasm, and multiple sclerosis. SWI, however, does not provide quantitative measures of magnetic susceptibility. This limitation is currently being addressed with the development of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and susceptibility tensor imaging (STI). While QSM treats susceptibility as isotropic, STI treats susceptibility as generally anisotropic characterized by a tensor quantity. This article reviews the basic principles of SWI, its clinical and research applications, the mechanisms governing brain susceptibility properties, and its practical implementation, with a focus on brain imaging.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the feasibility and the safety of applying chitosan membrane (ChiMe) on the neurovascular bundles (NVBs) after nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (NS-RARP). The secondary aim of the study was to report preliminary data and in particular potency recovery data. Patients and Methods This was a single-centre, single-arm prospective study, enrolling all patients with localised prostate cancer scheduled for RARP with five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function scores of >17, from July 2015 to September 2016. All patients underwent NS-RARP with ChiMe applied on the NVBs. The demographics, perioperative, postoperative and complications data were evaluated. Potency recovery data were evaluated in particular and any sign/symptom of local allergy/intolerance to the ChiMe was recorded and evaluated. Results In all, 140 patients underwent NS-RARP with ChiMe applied on the NVBs. Applying the ChiMe was easy in almost all the cases, and did not compromise the safety of the procedure. None of the patients reported signs of intolerance/allergy attributable to the ChiMe and potency recovery data were encouraging. Conclusion In our experience, ChiMe applied on the NVBs after NS-RARP was feasible and safe, without compromising the duration, difficulty or complication rate of the ?standard? procedure. No patients had signs of intolerance/allergy attributable to the ChiMe and potency recovery data were encouraging. A comparative cohort would have added value to the study. The present paper was performed before ConformitÃ© EuropÃ©ene (CE)-mark achievement.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this study is to establish a new experimental model of hematogenous implant-related infection (IRI) by a community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) strain. Cylindrical porous tantalum intramedullary implants were inserted in the proximal right tibia of 30 male white rabbits after administration of antibiotic prophylaxis. Four weeks later and without antibiotic prophylaxis, 20 animals received 1 ml of inoculum of two different concentrations (study groups A and B) of CA-MRSA strain through an ipsilatelar femoral artery catheter. The remaining 10 received normal saline instead (control group C). Surviving animals were sacrificed 4 weeks later. Sterile bone, bone marrow biopsies, and implants were harvested for culture and histological evaluation. Ten animals receiving 5???108cfu/ml (group A) died within 48?72 h due to septic shock. Blood cultures were positive; histology demonstrated acute infection. Ten animals received bacterial load of 3???108cfu/ml (group B) and all survived; two had negative Gram-stain and cultures but PCR and RT-PCR results demonstrated the viability of the microorganisms, while periprosthetic osteolysis and histological evaluation indicated subacute osteomyelitis; eight animals established periprosthetic infection, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis documented by positive Gram-stain, cultures, subperiosteal reaction, and chronic infection on histology. Control group specimens demonstrated no signs of infection. Histopathological semiquantitative scoring was used to compare the three groups. Comparison of groups A and B with control group and between group A and B showed statistically significant difference (p?<?0.05) in all parameters except for periosteal reaction between groups B and C (p?=?0.354). This novel, reproducible experimental model will facilitate the study of hematogenous CA-MRSA IRIs. ? 2008 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Developing wound dressings that have strong adhesion strength without causing any conglutination to the wound site is still challenging. Herein, is proposed that zwitterionic shape memory polymers can be applied as promising candidates for wound dressing. Sulfobetaine methacrylate (SBMA) is copolymerized with 2,3-dihydroxypropyl methacrylate (DHMA) in the presence of boric acid as a cross-linking agent. The prepared material exhibits multi-stimuli responsive shape memory behaviors: it can rapidly return to its initial shape upon heating to 90 Â°C, and a gradual recovery is also observed by absorbing moisture in humid environments. The shape memory effect can be well adjusted via incorporation of sodium chloride to induce the dissociation of electrostatic interactions between PSBMA chains, leading to reduced transition temperature and faster shape recovery rate. Moreover, the dynamic nature of boron ester bonds and electrostatic interaction endows the material with effective and rapid self-healing ability. It is also demonstrated that the deployment process of the dressing that a sample with an initially circular shape can perfectly fit and tightly bind to the wound site after moisture-induced shape recovery. The proposed zwitterionic polymer can possibly extend the application scope of shape memory polymers and pave a new way for the design of wound dressings.

AB  - Abstract Major haemorrhage is a leading cause of death in critically ill or injured patients requiring medical retrieval and presents significant clinical and logistic challenges irrespective of patient location, primary pathophysiology or mode of transport. It is essential that all care providers involved in the retrieval patient pathway, including referring hospitals, ambulance services, retrieval teams and tertiary receiving centres, adopt a common approach to the management of this complex patient group through the use of retrieval-specific, integrated protocols. These should incorporate the latest clinical evidence base, recognise the differences between primary and inter-facility missions and clearly define the roles and responsibilities of the retrieval clinical coordinator. By unifying the response across services, the aim is to facilitate seamless transition of care with ongoing damage control resuscitation from point of referral, during transfer and on arrival at the receiving centre.

AB  - Abstract The genome of the yeast Candida albicans harbours many genomic short sequence repeats (SSRs). These are stable upon transition of colonization to infection in immune-compromised patients. We show here that in non-neutropenic patients this transition may coincide with variation in several of the SSRs. This may have implications for stage-specific expression of C. albicans pathogenicity factors. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To report an interim clinical evaluation of combined external beam irradiation (EBRT) and interstitial or regional hyperthermia in the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS From 1997 to 2001, 26 patients with T3-4/NX/0M0 prostate carcinoma were treated with a combination of conformal EBRT and hyperthermia. Fourteen patients received five weekly regional hyperthermia treatments within an optimization (phase II) study, using the coaxial transverse electrical magnetic system. Twelve patients received one interstitial hyperthermia treatment within a feasibility study (phase I), using the multi-electrode current source system. Irradiation was delivered using a conformal three-field technique, administering 70?Gy in 2-Gy fractions in 7?weeks. RESULTS The mean initial prostate-specific antigen level was 26?ng/mL. Three patients had a T4 and 23 a T3 tumour; the tumours were classified as well (four), moderately (16) and poorly (six) differentiated. The mean follow-up was 36?months. In the combined treatments there was no toxicity of more than grade 2. In regional hyperthermia the mean index temperature (T90 and T50, i.e. exceeded by 90% and 50% of the measurements) was 40.2?Â°C and 40.8?Â°C, and for interstitial hyperthermia 39.4?Â°C and 41.8?Â°C, respectively. All patients survived; seven patients had a biochemical relapse (27%), three in the regional and four in the interstitial group. The actuarial probability of freedom from biochemical relapse was 70% at 36?months for all patients together, 79% for regional and 57% for interstitial. No factors were found that could be used to predict relapse. CONCLUSIONS The clinical outcome in these patients with advanced localized prostate cancer seems to compare favourably with most series using irradiation alone, and the treatment caused no severe complications.

AB  - Orbital cysts include the common epidermoid and dermoid cysts, cysts of conjunctival origin and cysts lined by respiratory-type epithelium. Respiratory epithelial cysts are exceedingly rare and have been reported in common locations for dermoid cysts (superotemporal and superonasal anterior orbit) and in sites atypical for dermoid cysts. Most represent maxillary sinus mucoceles extending into the orbital floor. In some patients, a history of orbital trauma or previous sinus surgery has been implicated in the implantation of the respiratory epithelium in the orbit. Rarely, the respiratory epithelial cyst has been considered to be a choristoma. We report the case of a 72-year-old woman who presented with a cyst in the anterior superotemporal orbit. There was no history of recent or remote trauma. The clinical impression was of a dermoid cyst. Histopathologic examination revealed a cyst lined by non-keratinizing squamous epithelium. A few goblet cells were present and focally, short strips of ciliated mucin secreting columnar cells were identified. The histopathologic findings were those of a respiratory epithelial cyst of the orbit. Given the rarity of this entity, valuable information can be gleaned from critical evaluation and reporting of new cases, in the context of existing data in the literature.

AB  - Gulf War illness (GWI) is a currently untreatable multi-symptom disorder experienced by 1990?1991 Persian Gulf War (GW) veterans. The characteristic hallmarks of GWI include cognitive dysfunction, tremors, migraine, and psychological disturbances such as depression and anxiety. Meta-analyses of epidemiological studies have consistently linked these symptomatic profiles to the combined exposure of GW agents such as organophosphate-based and pyrethroid-based pesticides (e.g. chlorpyrifos (CPF) and permethrin (PER) respectively) and the prophylactic use of pyridostigmine bromide (PB) as a treatment against neurotoxins. Due to the multi-symptomatic presentation of this illness and the lack of available autopsy tissue from GWI patients, very little is currently known about the distinct early pathological profile implicated in GWI (including its influence on synaptic function and aspects of neurogenesis). In this study, we used preclinical models of GW agent exposure to investigate whether 6-month-old mice exposed to CPF alone, or a combined dose of CPF, PB and PER daily for 10 days, demonstrate any notable pathological changes in hippocampal, cortical (motor, piriform) or amygdalar morphometry. We report that at an acute post-exposure time point (after 3 days), both exposures resulted in the impairment of synaptic integrity (reducing synaptophysin levels) in the CA3 hippocampal region and altered neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus (DG), demonstrated by a significant reduction in doublecortin positive cells. Both exposures also significantly increased astrocytic GFAP immunoreactivity in the piriform cortex, motor cortex and the basolateral amygdala and this was accompanied by an increase in (basal) brain acetylcholine (ACh) levels. There was no evidence of microglial activation or structural deterioration of principal neurons in these regions following exposure to CPF alone or in combination with PB and PER. Evidence of subtle microvascular injury was demonstrated by the reduction of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1 levels in CPF+PB+PER exposed group compared to control. These data support early (subtle) neurotoxic effects on the brain following exposure to GW agents.
