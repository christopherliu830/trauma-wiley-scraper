AB  - Abstract Older people experience skeletal muscle wasting, in part due to impaired proliferative capacity of quiescent skeletal muscle satellite cells which can be reversed by exposure to young blood. To investigate the role of immune cells in muscle regeneration, we isolated lymphocytes from whole blood of young and older healthy volunteers and cultured them with, or without, anti-CD3/CD28 activators to induce release of cytokines, interleukins, and growth factors into the media. The secreted proteins were collected to prepare a conditioned media, which was subsequently used to culture C2C12 myoblasts. The conditioned media from the activated young lymphocytes increased the rate of proliferation of myoblasts by around threefold (P < 0.005) and caused an approximate fourfold (P < 0.005) increase in migration compared with nonactivated lymphocyte control media. These responses were characterized by minimal myotube formation (2%), low fusion index (5%), low myosin heavy chain content, and substantial migration. In contrast, myoblasts treated with conditioned media from activated old lymphocytes exhibited a high degree of differentiation, and multi-nucleated myotube formation that was comparable to control conditions, thus showing no effect on proliferation or migration of myoblasts. These results indicate that secreted proteins from lymphocytes of young people enhance the muscle cell proliferation and migration, whereas secreted proteins from lymphocytes of older people may contribute to the attenuated skeletal muscle satellite cell proliferation and migration.

AB  - Background: Electrical isolation of pulmonary veins (PV) by radiofrequency (RF) ablation is often performed in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Current catheter technology usually requires the use of a multielectrode catheter for mapping in addition to the ablation catheter. Purpose: We evaluated the feasibility and safety of using a single, expandable electrode catheter (MESH) to map and to electrically isolate the PV. Methods and Results: Nineteen closed-chest mongrel dogs, weighing 23?35 kg, were studied under general anesthesia. Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) was used to guide transseptal puncture and to assess PV dimensions and contact of the MESH with PV ostia. ICE and angiography of RSPV were obtained before and after ablation, and prior to sacrifice at 7?99 days. An 11.5 Fr steerable MESH was advanced and deployed at the ostium of the RSPV. Recordings were obtained via the 36 electrodes comprising the MESH. For circumferential ablation, RF current was delivered at a target temperature of 62?65°C (4 thermocouples) and maximum power of 70?100 W for 180 to 300 seconds. Each animal received 1?4 RF applications. Entrance conduction block was obtained in 13/19 treated RSPVs. Pathological examination confirmed circumferential and transmural lesions in 13 of 19 RSPV. LA mural thrombus was present in 3 animals. There was no significant PV stenosis. Conclusion: Based on this canine model, a new expandable MESH catheter may safely be used for mapping and for PV antrum isolation. This approach may decrease procedure time without compromising success rate in patients undergoing AF ablation.

AB  - Total disc replacement using tissue-engineered intervertebral discs (TE-IVDs) may offer a biological alternative to treat radiculopathy caused by disc degeneration. A composite TE-IVD was previously developed and evaluated in rat tail and beagle cervical spine models in vivo. Although cell viability and tissue integration into host tissue were promising, significant implant displacement occurred at multiple spinal levels. The goal of the present study was to assess the effects of a resorbable plating system on the stiffness of motion segments and stability of tissue-engineered implants subjected to axial compression. Canine motion segments from levels C2/C3 to C5/C6 were assessed as intact (CTRL), after discectomy (Dx), with an implanted TE-IVD only (PLATE?), and with a TE-IVD combined with an attached resorbable plate (PLATE+). Segments under PLATE+ conditions fully restored separation between endplates and showed significantly higher compressive stiffness than segments under PLATE? conditions. Plated segments partially restored more than 25% of the CTRL motion segment stiffness. Plate attachment also prevented implant extrusion from the disc space at 50% compressive strain, and this effect was more significant in segments from levels C3/C4 when compared to segments from level C5/C6. These results suggest that stabilization of motion segments via resorbable plating assists TE-IVD retention in the disc space while allowing the opportunity for implants to fully integrate into the host tissue and achieve optimal restoration of spine biomechanics.

AB  - Introduction: The transforming growth factor beta (TGF?)/activin signaling pathway has a number of documented roles during wound healing and is increasingly appreciated as an essential component of multi-tissue regeneration that occurs in amphibians and fish. Among amniotes (reptiles and mammals), less is known due in part to the lack of an appropriate model organism capable of multi-tissue regeneration. The leopard gecko Eublepharis macularius is able to spontaneously, and repeatedly, regenerate its tail following tail loss. We examined the expression and localization of several key components of the TGF?/activin signaling pathway during tail regeneration of the leopard gecko. Results: We observed a marked increase in phosphorylated Smad2 expression within the regenerate blastema indicating active TGF?/activin signaling. Interestingly, during early regeneration, TGF?1 expression is limited whereas activin-?A is strongly upregulated. We also observe the expression of EMT transcription factors Snail1 and Snail2 in the blastema. Conclusions: Combined, these observations provide strong support for the importance of different TGF? ligands during multi-tissue regeneration and the potential role of TGF?/activin-induced EMT programs during this process.

AB  - The voltage-gated ?glial? sodium channel NaG belongs to a distinct molecular class within the multi-gene family of mammalian sodium channels. Originally found in central and peripheral glia, NaG has since been detected in neurons in rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and may play a role in Schwann cell-axon interactions. We have studied the presence of NaG-like immunoreactivity in the intact and injured human peripheral nervous system using a specific affinity-purified antibody. Nerve fibres in normal and injured peripheral nerves and normal skin exhibited intense NaG-immunoreactivity. Numerous NaG-immunoreactive nerve fibres surrounded neuronal cell bodies within postmortem control DRG, and in DRG avulsed from the spinal cord (i.e. after traumatic central axotomy). There were no significant differences in the pattern of NaG immunostaining between control and avulsed DRG, or with delay after injury. Generally, the neuronal cell bodies were only very weakly immunoreactive to NaG, indicating that the NaG immunoreactivity was predominantly in Schwann cells/myelin. In accord, we demonstrated NaG immunostaining in cultured human and rat Schwann cells, and in distal nerve after wallerian degeneration. NaG thus appears to be a useful new marker for Schwann cells in the human PNS, and a role in neuropathy deserves investigation.

AB  - Nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, a cutaneous hamartoma, results from disordered development of epidermal, follicular, sebaceous and apocrine differentiation that typically appears as a yellow verrucous plaque on the scalp or face. We present a 36-year-old white male with a congenital, nodular lesion along the hairline of his forehead, which had been traumatized repeatedly during hair grooming. Clinically, it was a well-demarcated, curvilinear, erythematous, non-tender plaque with no umbilication, ulceration or discharge. The periphery had a circumferential tan-yellow, raised, waxy serpiginous border. Microscopically, the specimen had epidermal papillomatous hyperplasia with dilated infundibula of irregular mature sebaceous lobules, and mid-dermal apocrine gland lobules. Within the hamartoma, was a well-circumscribed, multi-lobulated dermal tumor with epidermal and follicular attachments, focal ductal differentiation and cystic changes. Two distinct cell types were present; in the center were large polyhedral cells with focal clear cytoplasm, and at the periphery were spindle-shaped cells with basophilic cytoplasm. These findings were typical of nodular hidradenoma arising within a nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, a rare event with only seven cases previously documented in the literature.

AB  - Summary Background The role of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) in abdominal sepsis remains elusive. Objectives To study the influence of inhibition and over-expression of PAI-1 upon survival in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis. Methods (i) Mice underwent moderate CLP and received 10 mg kg?1 of either monoclonal anti-PAI-1 (MA-MP6H6) or control (MA-Control) antibody intravenously at 0, 18 or 30 h post-CLP. The 30-h treatment group was additionally stratified into mice predicted to survive (P-SUR) or die (P-DIE) based on IL 6 measured at 24 h post-CLP. (ii) PAI-1 expression was induced with pLIVE.PAI-1 plasmid administered 72 h pre-CLP. Blood was sampled for 5 days and survival was monitored for 28 days. Results MA-MP6H6 effectively neutralized active PAI-1 and fully restored fibrinolysis while PAI-1 over-expression was liver-specific and correlated with PAI-1 increase in the blood. Without stratification, MA-MP6H6 co-/post-treatment conferred no survival benefit. Prospective stratification (IL-6 cut-off: 14 ng mL?1) suggested increased mortality by MA-MP6H6 treatment in P-SUR that reached 30% difference (vs. MA-Control; P < 0.05) after a retrospective cut-off readjustment to 3.3 ng mL?1 for better P-SUR homogeneity. Subsequent prospective anti-PAI-1 treatment in P-SUR mice with 3.3 ng mL?1 cut-off demonstrated a negative but statistically insignificant effect: mortality was higher by 17% after MA-MP6H6 vs. MA-Control. Over-expression of PAI 1 did not alter post-CLP survival. Neither PAI-1 inhibition nor over-expression meaningfully modified inflammatory response and/or organ function. Conclusions Restoration of fibrinolysis in early abdominal sepsis was not beneficial and it may prove detrimental in subjects with the lowest risk of death, while preemptive PAI-1 up-regulation at the current magnitude was not protective.

AB  - To investigate the hypothesized relationship between various daily atmospheric pollutant concentrations and hospital epistaxis presentation. A retrospective analysis of all presentations of non-traumatic epistaxis to our institution was performed, and the results were cross-referenced with London air quality data supplied by the National Air Quality Data Archive at the National Environmental Technology Centre (NETCEN) at the multi-centre tertiary referral ENT Department. An analysis of epistaxis presentation to St George's Hospital during the 5-year period January 1997?2002 was made from the patient administration system and accident and emergency records. The study includes 1373 emergency patients after traumatic and iatrogenic epistaxis were excluded. Factors measured were atmospheric ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter less than 10??m in diameter (PM10). Hospital epistaxis presentation and atmospheric pollutant concentration were documented for each day of the 5-year period, weekly change in both parameters was recorded and statistical analysis was performed. The statistical methods used are linear correlation using Pearson's coefficient. Increased hospital epistaxis presentation was strongly associated with increased concentration of airborne particulate matter (r?=?0.289, P?<?0.001; significant if P?<?0.05) and less strongly associated with increased concentrations of atmospheric O3 (r?=?0.150, P?=?0.019; significant if P?<?0.05). There was no association between epistaxis attendance and atmospheric concentrations of CO, NO2 and SO2 in this study. The concentrations of local airborne particulate matter and atmospheric O3 in the days preceding hospital attendance for epistaxis are relevant when considering the associations of the episode. This further increases understanding of the pathophysiology of spontaneous epistaxis.

AB  - Abstract Hepatocytes can be generated from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) using inducers such as chemical compounds and cytokines, but issues related to low differentiation efficiencies remain to be resolved. Recent work has shown that overexpression of lineage-specific transcription factors can directly cause cells phenotypic changes, including differentiation, trans-differentiation, and de-differentiation. We hypothesized that lentivirus-mediated constitutive expression of forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (Hnf4a) could promote inducing mouse ESCs to hepatocyte-likes cells. First, ESC lines that stably expressed Foxa2, Hnf4a, or Foxa2/Hnf4a were constructed via lentiviral expression vectors. Second, observations of cell morphology changes were made during the cell culture process, followed by experiments examining teratoma formation. Then, the effects of constitutive expression of Foxa2 and Hnf4a on hepatic differentiation and maturation were determined by measuring the marker gene expression levels of Albumin, α-fetoprotein, Cytokeratin18, and α1-antitrypsin. The results indicate that constitutive expression of Foxa2 and Hnf4a does not affect ESCs culture, teratoma formation, or the expression levels of the specific hepatocyte genes under autonomous differentiation. However, with some assistance from inducing factors, Foxa2 significantly increased the hepatic differentiation of ESCs, whereas the expression of Hnf4a alone or Foxa2/Hnf4a could not. Differentiated CCE-Foxa2 cells were more superior in expressing several liver-specific markers and protein, storing glycogen than differentiated CCE cells. Therefore, our method employing the transduction of Foxa2 would be a valuable tool for the efficient generation of functional hepatocytes derived from ESCs. J. Cell.

AB  - Abstract Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal cord remain challenging due to the small cross-sectional size of the cord and susceptibility-related distortions. Although partially addressable through parallel imaging, few highly parallel array coils have been implemented for the cervical cord. Here, we developed a 32-channel coil that fully covers the brain and c-spine and characterized its performance in comparison with a commercially available head/neck/spine array. Image and temporal signal-to-noise ratio were, respectively, increased by 2? and 1.8? in the cervical cord. Averaged g-factors at 4? acceleration were lowered by 22% in the brain and by 39% in the spinal cord, enabling 1-mm isotropic R = 4 multi-echo magnetization prepared gradient echo of the full brain and c-spine in 3:20 min. Diffusion imaging of the cord at 0.6 ? 0.6 ? 5 mm3 resolution and tractography of the full brain and c-spine at 1.7-mm isotropic resolution were feasible without noticeable distortion. Improvements of this nature potentially enhance numerous basic and clinical research studies focused on spinal and supraspinal regions. Magn Reson Med, 2011. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
