AB  - Exercise-induced changes of transverse proton relaxation time (T2), tissue perfusion and metabolic turnover were investigated in the lower back muscles of volunteers by applying muscle functional MRI (mfMRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) before and after as well as dynamic 31P-MRS during the exercise. Inner (M. multifidus, MF) and outer lower back muscles (M. erector spinae, ES) were examined in 14 healthy young men performing a sustained isometric trunk-extension. Significant phosphocreatine (PCr) depletions ranging from 30% (ES) to 34% (MF) and Pi accumulations between 95% (left ES) and 120%?140% (MF muscles and right ES) were observed during the exercise, which were accompanied by significantly decreased pH values in all muscles (?pH?≈??0.05). Baseline T2 values were similar across all investigated muscles (approximately 27?ms at 3?T), but revealed right?left asymmetric increases (T2,inc) after the exercise (right ES/MF: T2,inc?=?11.8/9.7%; left ES/MF: T2,inc?=?4.6/8.9%). Analyzed muscles also showed load-induced increases in molecular diffusion D (p?=?.007) and perfusion fraction f (p?=?.002). The latter parameter was significantly higher in the MF than in the ES muscles both at rest and post exercise. Changes in PCr (p?=?.03), diffusion (p?<?.01) and perfusion (p?=?.03) were strongly associated with T2,inc, and linear mixed model analysis revealed that changes in PCr and perfusion both affect T2,inc (p?<?.001). These findings support previous assumptions that T2 changes are not only an intra-cellular phenomenon resulting from metabolic stress but are also affected by increased perfusion in loaded muscles.

AB  - Summary This chapter helps the readers to identify the structured approach to the clinical assessment and initial care of a patient requiring transfer, using the ABCDEF (Airway assessment and control; Breathing; Circulation; Disability and Dextrose; Exposure and Everything else; Family) approach to structure primary and secondary surveys. The primary survey (for infants this is called the initial approach assessment and stabilisation of any potentially life-threatening problems) followed by the secondary survey (for infants called the reassessment and planning of definitive care) are outlined. When becoming involved with the care of a patient for potential transfer it is important to follow exactly the same rules that are applied as the initial responder to an emergency. This is delivered through the use of the ABCDEF structure using a primary survey to seek out and treat any potentially life-threatening problems followed by secondary survey ABCDEF reassessment and planning of definitive care.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Ocular diseases in horses often require long-lasting and costly therapies. Without proper treatment they may lead to partial or full blindness, excluding horses from intended use, and thus pose a serious veterinary and economic problem. Objectives No epidemiological data on equine ocular pathologies in Poland was available. The aim of this study was to evaluate their type and prevalence in pure-bred Arabian horses. Study design The study involved 615 horses (15% of Arabian population) bred and owned by 3 Arabian state stud farms in Poland. All horses underwent standard clinical and ophthalmic examination and medical history from the previous 5 years was analysed. Methods The medical history was based on the data from farms? veterinary archives in the stables and epidemiological interview given by the resident veterinarian. Every horse underwent general clinical and ophthalmic examination. Results The prevalence of ocular diseases was 9.8% (95% CI: 7.7?12.4%). The following pathologies were diagnosed: equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) ? prevalence of 5.5% (95% CI: 4.0?7.6%), non-ERU related cataract ? 3.3% (95% CI: 1.9?4.7%), post traumatic lesions ? 0.8% (95% CI: 0.4?1.9%), glaucoma ? one case. Seven horses had one nonvisual eye, one was bilaterally blind. Conclusions Equine recurrent uveitis was the most common ocular disease in this Polish population of Arabian horses. Its prevalence is lower than usually reported in Europe (8?10%) and in the United States (8?25%). However, severe ocular pathologies were observed confirming that they remain an important clinical problem. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study was not stated. Sources of funding:?The research was supported by a grant from National Science Centre on the basis of the decision No DEC-2011/03/B/NZ6/04682. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the sepsis and the inflammatory response to injury. Higher doses of corticosteroids have been shown to be harmful in severe sepsis. Early administration of antibiotics has been shown to have a significant impact on outcomes with sepsis. The coagulation system plays an important role in the sepsis-induced inflammatory cascade. Coagulation is activated by the inflammatory reaction to tissue injury and is activated independent of the type of microbe (e.g., gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites). Coagulation induced by inflammation can in turn contribute to further inflammation. Depletion of anticoagulant and fibrinolytic factors contributes to the microvascular deposition of fibrin that is associated with organ dysfunction. Coagulation abnormalities in sepsis contribute significantly to organ dysfunction and death.

AB  - Abstract Background Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as nausea and bloating, are common in people with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Autonomic dysfunction can lead to changes in the GI secreto-motor function which can be associated with GI symptom development. We hypothesized that regional pH profiles in T1DM differs from health and would be associated with objective physiological/clinical markers. Methods Forty-seven T1DM with confirmed diabetic sensory peripheral neuropathy and 41 healthy age-matched subjects underwent standardized wireless motility capsule testing. T1DM completed the gastroparesis cardinal symptom index (GCSI) and the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale. Disease duration, glycemic control, insulin usage, and 24-hour heart rate variability testing were evaluated. Key Results In comparison to healthy subjects, gastric, and large bowel median pH were lower in T1DM (1.8 ± 1.6 vs 2.9 ± 1.5, P = 0.001 and 6.7 ± 0.6 vs 7.0 ± 0.5, P = 0.003, respectively). Additionally, change in pH across the pylorus was lower while change in pH across the ileocecal junction was higher in T1DM (5.2 ± 1.5 vs 5.8 ± 0.5, P = 0.003 and 1.8 ± 0.4 vs 1.3 ± 0.4, P < 0.0001, respectively). No difference was found in small bowel median pH. Gastric median pH was associated with small bowel transit time (r = 0.30, P = 0.049). Change in pH across the pylorus was negatively associated with fasting glycose (r = ?0.35, P = 0.027). Small bowel median pH was associated with nausea (r = 0.42, P = 0.005) and small bowel transit time (r = 0.48, P = 0.0007). Large bowel median pH was associated with nausea (r = 0.35, P = 0.018) and the total GCSI score (r = 0.34, P = 0.023). Conclusions and Inferences The GI pH profile in T1DM with DSPN is different from healthy subjects. Changes in pH profile may have important therapeutic implications and influence pharmacotherapeutic bioavailability.

AB  - Summary Background Infectious respiratory disease is common in young horses and can impact athletic performance and long-term health. Significant variation in the duration of clinical disease has been observed, even in the absence of secondary complications. The determination of factors associated with disease chronicity may facilitate clinical decision-making and the development of improved biosecurity protocols. Objective To investigate contact network characteristics, and demographic variables associated with time to clinical recovery from Equine Rhinitis A virus respiratory disease. Study design Prospective cohort study. Methods Yearling Standardbred racehorses (n = 58) housed in a multi-barn training facility in Southern Ontario were included. Horses were monitored daily for clinical signs of acute respiratory disease over a 41-day period in Autumn 2017. Contact patterns between horses, including older racehorses, were determined through use of proximity loggers attached to halters during the initial 7-day of the study. Associations between duration of disease, demographic factors (birth month, gait, sex and yearling sale), serologic titres and network metrics (degree, betweenness and Eigenvector centrality) were investigated using a Cox proportional hazard model. Results Yearling attack rate for infectious respiratory disease was 87.9% (n = 51). Median time to recovery was 6 days (IQR = 1?32) and 17 horses were censored due to early withdrawal or failure to recover during the study period. In those yearlings born February?May, birth month was significant in the Cox proportional hazard model (Hazard Ratio 0.7, 95% CI 0.49?1, P = 0.05). Main limitation Probability of censoring was not independent of outcome which necessitated use of sensitivity analysis. Conclusions These findings suggest late born foals are less likely to recover quickly from infectious respiratory disease.

AB  - Abstract One of the most important requirements for calcium phosphate bone cements (CPBC) is remodelling in vivo. Degradation of the artificial material and the formation of native new bone matrix have to interdigitate to avoid instability. The remodelling process should not last longer than one year. In this study a CPBC was modified with O-phospho-L-serine (phosphoserine) to improve the material properties in order to speed up remodelling in vivo. The results showed that the modified cements exhibit a nano-crystalline microstructure with a high specific surface area and increased compressive strength (about 50?%). Metabolic activity of osteoblasts was improved on the modified material. Monocytes were found to be highly activated on the cements containing phosphoserine. In addition the formation of multinucleated giant cells (osteoclast-like cells) was not impaired on phosphoserine modified cement composites. In vivo experiments in Wistar rats and mini pigs clearly revealed that phosphoserine modified cements showed a higher capability of remodelling compared to the cements without phosphoserine.

AB  - Summary Chemical immobilization of wild animals is a form of veterinary anesthesia conducted under difficult circumstances. The ideal capture site should allow good visualization of the animal during the induction period. Hyperthermia is a serious complication that can be difficult to treat in field situations. Equipment for airway support, including appropriately sized endotracheal tubes and a bag valve mask to enable mechanical ventilation should be included in an emergency kit. Physical capture, such as net gunning, rocket nets, drive nets, traps, and snares, can induce greater stress than chemical immobilization. Remote drug delivery systems have the potential to produce serious injury and death, if used inappropriately. The major sources of injury arise from dart impact trauma, high velocity injection of dart contents, and inaccurate dart placement. Careful planning, close monitoring, and early intervention are essential for preventing morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Abstract Though most virtual reality (VR) enthusiasts of the 1980s and 1990s now concede that the technology was overhyped, a new group of advocates believes it has found a practical use for it: as a tool for conducting psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health problems. Marisa Brandt argues that the use of VR as a therapeutic tool is premised on a way of thinking about how to intervene in disordered subjectivity using media - what she calls cybertherapeutic reason. In this chapter, Brandt gives a brief history of how early innovators discovered the therapeutic potential of VR and implemented cybertherapeutic reason by designing controllable virtual experiences. She then compares three proposed systems for treating combat-related PTSD to show how the design of VR therapy systems can reflect diverse understandings of how the technology could intervene in subjectivity. Finally, she suggests some of the ways that widespread adoption of VR may affect the practice of psychotherapy.

AB  - Summary Injury or illness involving the thorax frequently interferes with ventilation. The initial management must be directed to ensuring adequate oxygenation by administering oxygen prior to physical examination and considering other procedures. Secondly, injured patients may be hypovolemic due to blood loss, and ill patients may be hypovolemic due to the primary problem. Thirdly, administration of analgesia appropriate for the degree of pain, and to confer sedation to facilitate physical examination and pursue further procedures. Where ventilation is compromised requiring anesthesia and mechanical ventilation, selecting the appropriate regimen based on patient stability. Contraindications for local and epidural blocks are a significant wound or evidence of infection, over the anatomical area where the local block is to be performed with needle insertion. The veterinarian technician/nurse (VT/N) should always have intubation supplies ready for rapid sequence intubation in the thoracic trauma/respiratory distress patient, as sedation does not always have the desired effect.

AB  - Abstract M-type (KCNQ2/3) K+ channels play dominant roles in regulation of active and passive neuronal discharge properties such as resting membrane potential, spike-frequency adaptation, and hyper-excitatory states. However, plasticity of M-channel expression and function in nongenetic forms of epileptogenesis are still not well understood. Using transgenic mice with an EGFP reporter to detect expression maps of KCNQ2 mRNA, we assayed hyperexcitability-induced alterations in KCNQ2 transcription across subregions of the hippocampus. Pilocarpine and pentylenetetrazol chemoconvulsant models of seizure induction were used, and brain tissue examined 48?hr later. We observed increases in KCNQ2 mRNA in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons after chemoconvulsant-induced hyperexcitability at 48?hr, but no significant change was observed in dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells. Using chromogenic in situ hybridization assays, changes to KCNQ3 transcription were not detected after hyper-excitation challenge, but the results for KCNQ2 paralleled those using the KCNQ2-mRNA reporter mice. In mice 7?days after pilocarpine challenge, levels of KCNQ2 mRNA were similar in all regions to those from control mice. In brain-slice electrophysiology recordings, CA1 pyramidal neurons demonstrated increased M-current amplitudes 48?hr after hyperexcitability; however, there were no significant changes to DG granule cell M-current amplitude. Traumatic brain injury induced significantly greater KCNQ2 expression in the hippocampal hemisphere that was ipsilateral to the trauma. In vivo, after a secondary challenge with subconvulsant dose of pentylenetetrazole, control mice were susceptible to tonic?clonic seizures, whereas mice administered the M-channel opener retigabine were protected from such seizures. This study demonstrates that increased excitatory activity promotes KCNQ2 upregulation in the hippocampus in a cell-type specific manner. Such novel ion channel expressional plasticity may serve as a compensatory mechanism after a hyperexcitable event, at least in the short term. The upregulation described could be potentially leveraged in anticonvulsant enhancement of KCNQ2 channels as therapeutic target for preventing onset of epileptogenic seizures.

AB  - Summary Abdominal emergencies in the older patient frequently present atypically, and there is a high rate of misdiagnosis. Abdominal pain may be absent or minimal despite the present of serious intra-abdominal pathology. Abdominal pain may also be the presenting complaint in pulmonary or cardiac conditions. The commonest causes of abdominal symptoms in the older patient include biliary disease, bowel obstruction, diverticulitis, appendicitis, and peptic ulcer disease. Caution should be taken attributing abdominal pain to more benign conditions such as urinary tract infection or constipation, for fear of missing more serious pathology.

AB  - ABSTRACT Orthogonal plate osteosynthesis enhances fixation stability in periprosthetic femur fractures. Another option are locking attachment plates (LAP) allowing bicortical locking screw placement lateral to the prosthesis stem. Stability of lateral plate osteosynthesis with two LAP (2LAP) was compared to anterolateral orthogonal plate osteosynthesis (OP) with one LAP in a periprosthetic femur fracture model. In six pairs of fresh frozen human femora with cemented Charnley hip prosthesis, a transverse osteotomy was set distal to the tip of the prosthesis simulating a Vancouver type B1 fracture. Each pair was instrumented using a plate tensioner with either one lateral plate and two LAP, or two orthogonal anterolateral plates and one LAP. Stiffness was determined in a four-point-bending test prior to cyclic testing (2Hz) with physiologic profile and progressively increasing load up to catastrophic construct failure. Paired t-test and Wilcoxon-signed-rank test were used for statistical evaluation at a level of significance p?=?0.05. The OP construct exhibited a significantly higher number of cycles and load to failure (39,627 cycles?±?4,056; 4,463?N?±?906) compared to the 2LAP construct (32,927 cycles?±?3,487; 3,793?N?±?849), p?<?0.01. Mediolateral bending and torsional stiffness of the OP (1610?N/mm?±?249; 16.9?Nm/mm?±?6.3) were significantly higher compared to 2?LAP (1077?N/mm?±?189; 12.1?Nm/mm?±?3.9), p?=?0.03 for both comparisons. Orthogonal plate osteosynthesis is a valuable option in periprosthetic fracture surgery, offering increased stability compared to a single lateral plate fixed with two LAP. ? 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.
