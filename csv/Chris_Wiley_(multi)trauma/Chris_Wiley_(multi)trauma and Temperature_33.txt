AB  - Abstract Heat-delivery devices have been associated with relatively high temperatures. Previous basic research studies suggest that the risk for periodontal tissues is negligible, as the presence of the root filling materials, amongst other factors, reduce the risk of overheating. This report describes the case of a 45 year old male, who was undergoing restorative treatment in a multi-specialty dental practice. As part of his overall treatment planning, orthograde root canal retreatment for his maxillary left incisor teeth was deemed necessary, due to chronic apical periodontitis. Following cold lateral compaction, the coronal portion of the core material was severed using a System B Heat Source (Kerr Dental, Orange, CA, USA), with the patient reporting pain as well as a burning sensation. The following day the patient was seen by a periodontist and gingival necrosis in relation to the central incisor was found. The most likely cause of the complication was considered to be excessive heat during the operative procedure. The patient was followed up for a 2-year period and the soft tissues returned to their original condition without the need for periodontal treatment.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the hemodynamic and respiratory monitoring. It is essential for a practitioner to understand oxygen delivery and how it can be optimized when providing adequate hemodynamic support in the critically ill patient. The rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) is the ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume. Patients who cannot tolerate independent breathing tend to breathe rapidly and shallow. Multiple factors can affect the accuracy of pulse oximetry monitors. CO-oximetry is a four wavelength non-invasive monitoring system that allows additional measurements of blood constituents. It not only measures oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, as pulse oximetry does, but also dyshemoglobins. End-tidal CO2 monitoring can help identify problems immediately after intubation and before critical hypoxemia becomes manifest. Adding lactate determinations to oxygen transport monitoring provides a more complete assessment of tissue oxygenation.

AB  - Summary Endocrine causes of hypertensive emergencies are easily overlooked when patients present with uncontrolled hypertension in association with evidence of end-organ damage. Emergencies arising from hypertensive crises due to pheochromocytoma can be particularly dangerous. To ensure appropriate therapeutic counter-measures and a favorable outcome, the presence of a catecholamine-producing tumor should be distinguished from more common etiologies as well as other uncommon endocrine causes, such as primary hyperaldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, and thyrotoxicosis. However, diagnosis at the time of the emergency can be made difficult by activation of the sympathoadrenal system resulting from the physiological stress of the clinical condition. Tests of catecholamine excess are therefore rendered problematic to interpret, with reliable diagnosis often only possible once and if the patient recovers. Because of this and time delays in obtaining test results, recognition of a possible endocrine cause in the emergency setting requires careful attention to patient history, presentation, and precipitating causes that may provide clues to underlying etiologies to guide therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Abstract Objective To investigate the efficacy of maxillary and infraorbital nerve blocks for prevention of cardiovascular and qualitative responses to rhinoscopy, as well as response to skin clamping after assigned nerve block placement. Study design Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over experimental study. Animals Eight random-source mixed breed dogs > 1 year old and weighing between 13 and 22 kg. Methods Within three anesthetic episodes, separated by at least 3 days, dogs were assigned to receive either 1 mL lidocaine 2% maxillary nerve block (ML); 0.5 mL lidocaine 2% infraorbital nerve block (IOL); or equal amounts of saline for maxillary or infraorbital nerve block combined as control treatment (S). Monitoring included temperature, respiratory rate, end-tidal CO2, ECG, heart rate (HR), systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure (SAP, DAP, MAP). Posterior (pR) and anterior rhinoscopies (aR) were performed and scored. Differences from baseline for outcome parameters HR, SAP, DAP, MAP were analyzed using repeated-measures anova, and results reported as mean ± SD. Binary scores for rhinoscopy were analyzed using logistic regression, and odds ratio was reported. Results Changes from baseline for HR and SAP were significant for all treatments, besides ML for pR. Difference in changes from baseline among treatments was statistically significant for HR during pR with ML < S, and for SAP, DAP and MAP in right and left aR with ML < S and IOL > ML, except for DAP in left aR with only IOL > ML. Analysis of the binary score showed that the probability of a response for S and IOL treatments was nearly triple that of the ML treatment. None of the dogs, regardless of the treatments applied, responded to skin clamping. Conclusion and clinical relevance Cardiovascular parameters do not seem to reflect the occurrence of adverse reactions during rhinoscopy. The maxillary nerve block is superior to the infraorbital nerve block, as applied in this study, in preventing adverse reactions during posterior rhinoscopy.

AB  - Abstract Stem cell-based gene therapy has been considered in the treatment of many degenerative diseases. Gene-modified stem cells should maintain its reproductive activity without losing stem cell properties, including genetic phenotype and differentiation potential. In the study, a novel poly (amidoamine) with pendant aminobutyl group (PAA-BA) designed by our group was used in the transfection of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) and the cellular properties post-transfection were evaluated, including DNA content, colony forming capacity, genetic phenotype, and multi-directional differentiation. Two classical non-viral gene delivery vectors, polyethylenimine (PEI) and Lipofectamine 2000 (LP2000) were also used. Compared to non-transfected group, PAA-BA showed minor decreased DNA content but maintained BMSCs? phenotype, reproductive activity and multi-differentiation potential (osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic, and neurogenic differentiation). Both PAA-BA and PEI transfected BMSCs demonstrated improved osteogenic differentiation ability at late stage but suppressed adipogenic as well as mature neural differentiation in vitro. LP2000 and PEI transfected BMSCs displayed significantly lower DNA content and reproductive activity. These findings suggest that PAA-BA is one of safe gene delivery vectors in BMSCs transfection and plays a role in stem cell's osteogenic and neurogenic differentiation. This study proposes the potential application of PAA-BA in BMSCs based gene therapy, in particular bone and nerve relative diseases. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Damage to the central nervous system triggers rapid activation and specific migration of glial cells towards the lesion site. There, glial cells contribute heavily to secondary neuronal changes that take place after lesion. In an attempt to identify the molecular cues of glial activation following brain trauma we performed differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction screenings from lesioned and control hippocampus. Here we report on the identification of the macrophage/microglia activation factor (MAF), a new membrane protein with seven putative transmembrane domains. Expression analysis revealed that MAF is predominantly expressed in microglial cells in the brain, and is upregulated following brain lesion. Overexpression of MAF in non-glial cells shows an intracellular codistribution with the lysosomal marker endosome/lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (lamp-1). Furthermore, MAF-transfected cells show that MAF is primarily associated with late endosomes/lysosomes, and that this association can be disrupted by activation of protein kinase C-dependent pathways. In conclusion, these results imply that MAF is involved in the dynamics of lysosomal membranes associated with microglial activation following brain lesion.

AB  - ABSTRACT Mast cells, important sensor and effector cells of the immune system, may influence bone metabolism as their number is increased in osteoporotic patients. They are also present during bone fracture healing with currently unknown functions. Using a novel c-Kit-independent mouse model of mast cell deficiency, we demonstrated that mast cells did not affect physiological bone turnover. However, they triggered local and systemic inflammation after fracture by inducing release of inflammatory mediators and the recruitment of innate immune cells. In later healing stages, mast cells accumulated and regulated osteoclast activity to remodel the bony fracture callus. Furthermore, they were essential to induce osteoclast formation after ovariectomy. Additional in vitro studies revealed that they promote osteoclastogenesis via granular mediators, mainly histamine. In conclusion, mast cells are redundant in physiologic bone turnover but exert crucial functions after challenging the system, implicating mast cells as a potential target for treating inflammatory bone disorders. ? 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Summary Background Information is needed to guide sport administrators in formulating rules for equipment use in competitions. Objectives To seek associations between spurs, bits, nosebands and whips with injuries in horses during competitions in four equestrian sports. Study design Cross sectional study. Methods Post competition evaluations were performed in 3143 horse/rider combinations competing in Danish Equestrian Federation competitions in dressage, showjumping, eventing and endurance by trained evaluators who recorded the presence and type of spurs, bits, nosebands, and whips. Further evaluations recorded noseband tightness, (in three categories <2 cm, 2?3 cm, >3 cm), the presence of hair or blood on spurs; hair loss, lesions or blood on the ribcage behind the girth; abrasions and/or blood at the commissures of the lips; and swelling, lesions or blood on the forequarters or hindquarters. Statistical analysis was performed to determine relationships between discipline (dressage, showjumping, eventing, endurance), level of competition (level 0?7), type/tightness of equipment, and prevalence of injuries. Results The presence of hair (3.2% of horse/rider combinations) and blood (0.4% of horse/rider combinations) on spurs were highly associated. Longer spurs and lower competition levels were significantly associated with hair on the spurs and worn hair on the horse's ribcage. Oral lesions or blood were visible at the commissures of the lips in 9.2% of horses and increased with level of competition but did not differ between bit types or bitless bridles. Looser upper noseband category was associated with decreased risk of oral lesions (odds ratio [OR] 0.66, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.51?0.86, P = 0.002). However, the absence of a cavesson increased the risk of lesions at the commissures of the lips 2.39 times compared with the loosest noseband (95% CI 1.4?4.11, P = 0.002). Main limitations The rules of the equestrian federation did not permit a full intraoral examination. Selection of rider/horse combination was not random. Conclusions Lesions of the skin or mucosa at the commissures of the lips may be decreased by limiting noseband tightness and lesions on the chest wall may be decreased by limiting the length of spurs.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To evaluate the isoflurane-sparing effects of lidocaine administered by constant rate infusion (CRI) during umbilical surgery in calves. Study design? Randomized ?blinded? prospective clinical study. Animals? Thirty calves (mean 4.7?±?SD 2.5?weeks old) undergoing umbilical surgery. Methods? After premedication with xylazine (0.1?mg?kg?1, IM), anaesthesia was induced with ketamine (4?mg?kg?1, IV) and maintained with isoflurane in O2 administered through a circle breathing system. The calves were assigned randomly to receive a bolus of 2?mg?kg?1 lidocaine IV after induction of anaesthesia, followed by CRI of 50??g?kg?1?minute?1 (group L, n?=?15) or a bolus and CRI of 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl, group S, n?=?15). End-tidal isoflurane was adjusted to achieve adequate depth of anaesthesia. Heart rate, direct arterial blood pressure and body temperature were measured intraoperatively. Groups were compared by t- tests, anova or Mann?Whitney rank sum test as appropriate. Results? The end-tidal concentration of isoflurane (median, IQR) was significantly lower in group L [1.0% (0.94?1.1)] compared to group S [1.2% (1.1?1.5)], indicating a 16.7% reduction in anaesthetic requirement during lidocaine CRI. Cardiopulmonary parameters and recovery times did not differ significantly between groups. Conclusion and clinical relevance? Lidocaine CRI may be used as a supplement to inhalation anaesthesia during umbilical surgery in calves in countries where such a protocol would be within the legal requirements for veterinary use in food animals. This study did not show any measurable benefit to the calves other than a reduction in isoflurane requirement.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare anaesthesia and recovery parameters of racemic ketamine or S(+)-ketamine in combination with medetomidine for intramuscular (IM) field anaesthesia in the European brown hare (EBH) (Lepus europaeus). Study design? Randomized, prospective, blinded clinical trial. Animals? 20 adult EBH (eight male, 12 female), mean ±?SD weight 3360?341). Methods? Medetomidine (0.2?mg?kg?1) and ketamine (30?mg?kg?1) (K-M group) or S(+)-ketamine (15?mg?kg?1) (S-M group) were administered by IM injection. Time until first effect and loss of righting reflex were recorded. During sedation and anaesthesia heart rate, saturation of arterial haemoglobin, respiratory rate, side stream end tidal CO2 (Pe?CO2), non invasive blood pressure, body temperature, cardiorespiratory parameters, palpebral reflex, jaw tone and nociception were recorded every 5?minutes. Medetomidine was antagonized with IM atipamezole (1?mg?kg?1) 45?minutes after treatment injection. Time until first head lift, standing and total recovery time (T-Recov) were recorded. Incidences of falling and involuntary movements during recovery were counted. Recovery quality was scored by visual analogue scale. Descriptive statistics were used to visualize maintenance data. All other data were included in multiple linear regression models. Results? Surgical anesthesia was not produced reliably with either protocol. Hypoxaemia occurred in both groups (SpO2?<?90%). During recovery, falling was noted significantly less often (p?<?0.001) in the S-M group (13?±?7) versus the K-M group (27?±?13). T-Recov was long, lasting for more than 3 hours in individuals with no significant differences between groups. Conclusion and clinical relevance? S(+)-ketamine showed only minor advantages over racemic ketamine. Surgical anaesthesia was not achieved reliably with either protocol. Oxygen supplementation should be considered to prevent hypoxaemia. Further research is needed to develop an injectable field protocol adequate for surgical procedures, but with a rapid smooth recovery.

AB  - Abstract Although certain drugs of abuse are known to disrupt brain glucose metabolism (BGluM), the effects of opiates on BGluM are not well characterized. Moreover, preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) studies anesthetize animals during the scan, which limits clinical applications. We investigated the effects of (i) isoflurane anesthesia and (ii) intravenous morphine self-administration (MSA) on BGluM in rats. Jugular vein cannulated adult male Sprague-Dawley rats self-administered either saline (SSA) or morphine (0.5 mg/kg/infusion, 4 h/day for 12 days). All animals were scanned twice with [18F]-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG)-PET/CT at a baseline and at 2-day withdrawal from self-administration. After the IV injection of FDG, one batch of animals (n = 14) was anesthetized with isoflurane and the other batch (n = 16) was kept awake during the FDG uptake (45 min). After FDG uptake, all animals were anesthetized in order to perform a PET/CT scan (30 min). Isoflurane anesthesia, as compared to the awake condition, reduced BGluM in the olfactory, cortex, thalamus, and basal ganglia, while increasing BGluM in the midbrain, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Morphine self-administered animals exhibited withdrawal signs (piloerection and increased defecation), drug seeking, and locomotor stimulation to morphine (0.5 mg/kg) during the 2 day withdrawal. The BGluM in the striatum was increased in the MSA group as compared to the SSA group; this effect was observed only in the isoflurane anesthesia, not the awake condition. These findings suggest that the choice of the FDG uptake condition may be important in preclinical PET studies and increased BGluM in the striatum may be associated with opiate seeking in withdrawal.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a progressive disease process underlain by dynamic and interactive biochemical mechanisms; thus, large-scale and unbiased assessments are needed to fully understand its highly complex pathobiology. Here, we report on a new high-capacity label-free proteomic platform to evaluate the post-TBI neuroproteome. Six orthogonal separation stages and data-independent MS were employed, affording reproducible quantitative assessment on 18 651 peptides across biological replicates. From these data 3587 peptides were statistically responsive to TBI of which 18% were post-translationally modified. Results revealed as many as 484 proteins in the post-TBI neuroproteome, which was fully nine times the number determined from our prior study of focal cortical injury. Yet, these data were generated using 25 times less brain tissue per animal relative to former methodology, permitting greater anatomical specificity and proper biological replication for increased statistical power. Exemplified by these data, we discuss benefits of peptide-centric differential analysis to more accurately infer novel biological findings testable in future hypothesis-driven research. The high-capacity label-free proteomic platform is designed for multi-factor studies aimed at expanding our knowledge on the molecular underpinnings of TBI and to develop better diagnostics and therapeutics.
