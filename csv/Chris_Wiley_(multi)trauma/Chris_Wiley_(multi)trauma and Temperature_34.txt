AB  - ABSTRACT A thorough understanding of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) function and the effects of surgical interventions on knee biomechanics requires robust technologies and simulation paradigms that align with clinical insight. In vitro orthopedic biomechanical testing for the elucidation of ACL integrity doesn't have an established testing paradigm to simulate the clinical pivot shift exam on cadaveric specimens. The study aim was to develop a robotically simulated pivot shift that represents the clinical exam. An orthopedic surgeon performed a pivot shift on an instrumented ACL-deficient cadaver leg to capture 6 degree-of-freedom motion/loads. The same knee was mounted to the robot and the sensitivity of the motion/loading profiles quantified. Three loading profile candidates that generated positive pivot shifts on the instrumented knee were selected and applied to 7 ACL-intact/deficient specimens and resulted in the identification of a profile that was able to induce a positive pivot shift in all ACL-deficient specimens ( p?<?0.001). The simulated shifts began at 22?±?8° and ended at 33?±?6° of flexion with the average magnitude of the shifts being 12.8?±?3.2?mm in anterior tibial translation and 17.6?±?4.3° in external tibial rotation. The establishment and replication of a robotically simulated clinical pivot shift across multiple specimens show the robustness of the loading profile to accommodate anatomical and experimental variability. Further evaluation and refinement should be undertaken to create a useful tool in evaluating ACL function and reconstruction techniques. Statement of clinical significance: Creation and successful demonstration of the simulated clinical pivot shift validates a profile for robotic musculoskeletal simulators to analyze ACL related clinical questions. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a progressive disease process underlain by dynamic and interactive biochemical mechanisms; thus, large-scale and unbiased assessments are needed to fully understand its highly complex pathobiology. Here, we report on a new high-capacity label-free proteomic platform to evaluate the post-TBI neuroproteome. Six orthogonal separation stages and data-independent MS were employed, affording reproducible quantitative assessment on 18 651 peptides across biological replicates. From these data 3587 peptides were statistically responsive to TBI of which 18% were post-translationally modified. Results revealed as many as 484 proteins in the post-TBI neuroproteome, which was fully nine times the number determined from our prior study of focal cortical injury. Yet, these data were generated using 25 times less brain tissue per animal relative to former methodology, permitting greater anatomical specificity and proper biological replication for increased statistical power. Exemplified by these data, we discuss benefits of peptide-centric differential analysis to more accurately infer novel biological findings testable in future hypothesis-driven research. The high-capacity label-free proteomic platform is designed for multi-factor studies aimed at expanding our knowledge on the molecular underpinnings of TBI and to develop better diagnostics and therapeutics.

AB  - The moisture contents of foods, fluids, and parenteral solutions taken in and of all samples excreted, the water of oxidation of fuel mixtures burned, and the evaporative water loss must be determined in order to obtain a quantitative picture of water balance. Because there is a tendency to retain water after trauma, surgery, or an acute illness, changes in the water compartment of the body may lead to changes in body weight that may be considered erroneously as changes in energy or protein stores. Measurement of water balance, in addition to calorie and nitrogen balance is one of the most accurate means of accounting for these changes in body composition. Fluid and electrolyte therapy and nutritional supplementation can be tailored to meet the patient's specific needs by utilizing this information. Application of these principles to the care of hospitalized patients outside of the research setting will be discussed.

AB  - Abstract Vulvodynia in young women is a significant clinical challenge. This overview focuses on localized provoked vulvodynia (LPV) with regard to medical and physical predictors of the condition. Several causative factors have been proposed and one major conceptual issue is the role of inflammation. Trauma to the vestibular mucosa causes an initial inflammatory response which may result in peripheral and central pain sensitization. In women with LPV, evidence of mucosal nerve fiber proliferation and enhanced systemic pain perception has been found. A dysfunction of the pelvic floor muscles is common and many patients also suffer from other bodily pain. In general, the level of scientific quality in published studies on vulvodynia is low. Further research on epidemiology, etiology and conduction of clinical trials with high evidence grade is desired.

AB  - Abstract Aim:? Therapeutic hypothermia after perinatal asphyxia decreases brain injury in newborns, whereas hyperthermia worsens the brain injury. We examined how different clinical practices influence regional brain temperatures during hypothermia. Methods:? Six newborn pigs, which have comparable physiology and brain maturation to human term infants, were maintained at hypothermia (33.5°C) or normothermia with a servo-controlled whole-body cooling device that is in clinical use. Pigs were anesthetized and fully instrumented for cardiovascular and temperature (rectal and regional brain) monitoring. Changes in brain temperatures were measured during four different paradigms to mimic different clinical practices. Results:? Inserting an insulating pillow between the head and the heated surface reduced cortex temperature by 1 or 2°C during normothermia (core temperature Tcore 37°C) or hypothermia, Tcore 33.5°C. Reducing ambient temperature from 28°C to 23°C reduced cortex temperature by 3.9?±?1.9°C. Without a hat and overhead heater at normothermia, cortex and deep brain temperatures were reduced by 1.2?±?0.8 and 0.7?±?0.7°C, respectively. Direct overhead heating abolished the normal cortex to deep brain temperature gradient that was maintained if using a head shield. Conclusion:? Brain temperature may differ from core temperature during therapeutic hypothermia influenced by different clinical practices.

AB  - Abstract Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonotic infectious disease in Malaysia. The symptoms of leptospirosis vary from mild nonspecific flu-like illness to a severe condition which is usually associated with serious complication and fatality. To study the protein expression profile of mild and severe leptospirosis, 15 paired sera were collected from the patients who were mildly infected and following that progressed to severe stage. The proteome profiles of mild and severe cases were studied using 2DE analysis in combination with LC-MS/MS. The expression of proteins that were significantly different and had a fold difference of at least 2 had been identified and then validated using Western blot. Our study demonstrated apolipoprotein A-I (APOA-I), serum amyloid A (SAA), transferrin (TF), haptoglobin (HP) and transthyretin (TTR) have significantly different expression between mild and severe leptospirosis. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software suggested the expression of these five proteins were modulated by acute phase response signaling pathway. Besides that, a functional network of lipid metabolism, molecular transport and small molecule biochemistry that interconnects these five proteins with interactomes also had been predicted by this software. In conclusion, this finding supports the potential of these five proteins to be the biomarkers for mild and severe human leptospirosis.

AB  - Abstract Nanomedicine is a rapidly emerging technology and represents an innovative field for therapy. Nanomaterials have intrinsically defined features for biomedical applications due to the high specific surface area, the amazing diversity, versatility in structure and function and the possibility of surface charge. In particular, the functionalization of targeting or stimuli-responsive unit on the surface of these materials gives them specific targeted therapeutic properties. There are many pediatric lung diseases that could potentially benefit from nanomedicine. Herein, we aim to review various drug carrier systems and release systems specifically targeting pediatric lung diseases. The injection of nanomedicine into in vivo models and their elimination will also be discussed. Finally, the potential toxicity of nanomaterials will be addressed.

AB  - Summary The management of dental emergencies in the hospital environment has evolved dramatically over the past few decades. General and pediatric dentists, as well as oral and maxillofacial surgeons are now often the primary providers of care and might manage everything from a simple toothache to the most severe maxillofacial maladies and craniofacial injuries. A thorough knowledge of the organizational, triage, and treatment protocols in the emergency department greatly enhances the dentist's ability to provide rapid, appropriate, and broadly scoped emergency care. This chapter discusses, inter alia, medicolegal aspects of emergency care, intra-oral urgencies, postoperative emergencies, odontogenic infections, salivary gland emergencies, maxillofacial trauma, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) emergencies, in detail.

AB  - Pelvic exsanguination is usually fatal unless the patient is injured in a city or region that has a sophisticated trauma care system. Simple rules need to be considered when defining the care strategy for these patients. Simple rules: ?? Establish at pre-hospital care and delivery system ?? Recognize the ?at risk? patient or injury pattern ?? Rule out and/or account for other major sources of bleeding ?? Control other sources of bleeding, if possible ?? Resuscitate to a ?tolerable? blood pressure ?? Blood product replacement: RBCs, platelets and FFP ?? Provisionally stabilize the pelvis ?? pelvic binder or sheet ?? ipsilateral femoral traction, in some cases ?? Emergent external fixation? ?? Stop arterial bleeding ?? Angiography and selective embolization ?? Exploration and direct pelvic gutter packing ?? Don?t be fooled by a positive FAST from an extra-peritoneal bladder rupture ?? an ex-lap for a retroperitoneal bleed can be fatal ?? To the TICU for continued resuscitation ?? Delayed definitive reconstruction when physiologically stable

AB  - Abstract Hypovolemia and hypotension in traumatized patients as well as those undergoing long-lasting surgical procedures lead to hypoperfusion of tissues. Combined with the trauma of flap elevation and the warm ischemia during performance of the anastomoses, hypoperfusion of flap tissues may lead to flap failure. The influence of hypovolemia, ischemia and reperfusion on flap macro- and microcirculation was studied in an acute experiment on a new musculocutaneous pectoralis flap developed in minipigs. Using a multichannel laser Doppler system we studied, simultaneously and continuously, microcirculatory flow (MBF) in both the skin and muscle of the flap as well as in the contralateral control skin and muscle in anesthetized minipigs (n = 7). Measurements were done before and after raising the flap, after 90 min of flap ischemia, during mild to moderate hypovolemia (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% blood loss) and during and after restoration of blood volume. Electromagnetic flowmetry was used to measure total blood flow (TBF) to the flap. All animals remained hemodynamically stable during the experiment. The flap MBF decreased by 20% in the skin and 25% in the muscle after flap elevation with no changes in the control skin and muscle. After flap ischemia and reperfusion, MBF returned to post-elevation values while TBF showed a significant increase as compared to MBF (P<0.05). Hypovolemia caused a gradual drop in cardiac output (25%) and mean arterial pressure (40%), but both recovered above the baseline after reinfusion of shed blood. Hypovolemia also caused a 60% reduction in MBF in both flap skin and muscle, and only 20?23% in control skin and muscle (P<0.01). After reinfusion of shed blood the MBF in the flap remained 30?40% below and the TBF increased 20% over the baseline. The MBF in control skin and muscle increased more than 20% over baseline (P<0.01). It was concluded that MBF in flap skin and muscle decreased by approximately 20?25% as a consequence of flap elevation, while central parameters remained normal. It was shown that even during moderate hypovolemia, MBF in the flap might decrease to critical levels. We suggest that intensive monitoring of central hemodynamics and continuous LDF monitoring of the flap during and after surgery should be performed in order to restore the blood volume expeditiously and prevent irreversible damage to flap tissues. ? 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary As an acute intervertebral disc (IVD) herniation/embolus injures the spinal cord to some degree, and may present as a traumatic incident, approach to diagnosis and management will be presented as an injury. Patients with spinal cord and vertebral injury or disease can exhibit myriad pain levels, in addition to frustration and anxiety. This anxiety and frustration can compound the pain level and pain scoring of a patient and should be taken into consideration. Before offering anti-anxiolytic medications, consider pain level and provide appropriate analgesia. Anesthesia-induced relaxation of the muscles that may be tensed to protect the injured area and inattentive handling of the patient during positioning for intubation, movement on/off gurneys, positioning for imaging/procedures can worsen the patient's pain and may even exacerbate the injury. Pathology may be due to ischemia, inflammation, infection, hemorrhage, tumours or extradural compression resulting in persistent or intermittent somatic or visceral neuropathic pain.
