AB  - The late endosomal adaptor protein LAMTOR2/p14 is essential for tissue homeostasis by controlling MAPK and mTOR signaling, which in turn regulate cell growth and proliferation, migration and spreading. Moreover, LAMTOR2 critically controls architecture and function of the endocytic system, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation in lysosomes, positioning of late endosomes and defense against intracellular pathogens. Here we describe the multifaceted ultrastructural phenotype of the endo/lysosomal system of LAMTOR2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Quantitative (immuno-)electron microscopy of cryo-fixed samples revealed significantly reduced numbers of recycling tubules emanating from maturing multivesicular bodies (MVB). Instead, a distinct halo of vesicles surrounded MVB, tentatively interpreted as detached, jammed recycling tubules. These morphological changes in LAMTOR2-deficient cells correlated with the presence of growth factors (e.g. EGF), but were similarly induced in control cells by inactivating mTOR. Furthermore, proper transferrin receptor trafficking and recycling were apparently dependent on an intact LAMTOR complex. Finally, a severe imbalance in the relative proportions of endo/lysosomes was found in LAMTOR2-deficient cells, resulting from increased amounts of mature MVB and (autophago)lysosomes. These observations suggest that the LAMTOR/Ragulator complex is required not only for maintaining the homeostasis of endo/lysosomal subpopulations but also contributes to the proper formation of MVB-recycling tubules, and regulation of membrane/cargo recycling from MVB.

AB  - Summary Critical illness, an extreme form of severe physical stress, is characterized by important endocrine and metabolic changes. Due to critical care medicine, survival from previously lethal conditions has become possible but many patients now enter a chronic phase of critical illness. The role of the endocrine and metabolic responses to acute and prolonged critical illness in mediating or hampering recovery remains highly debated. In recent years, important novel insights into the pathophysiology and the consequences of these endocrine responses to acute and chronic critical illness have been generated. This chapter summarizes these insights with a specific focus on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and on the impact of the hyperglycemic response, on recovery from critical illness. The therapeutic implications of these novel insights are critically analyzed.

High-affinity glutamate uptake was studied in platelets from 35 Alzheimer's disease patients, 10 multi-infarct dementia patients, and 35 age-matched normal controls; it was decreased by 40% in platelets from Alzheimer's disease patients compared with controls and with multi-infarct dementia patients. Platelet glutamate uptake could be used as peripheral marker of glutamatergic involvement and as adjunctive diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease patients. Ann Neurol 2000;47:641?643

AB  - The inhibition of microbial growth is the first step toward avoiding the formation of biofilms. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the microbiostatic activity of cold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAP) with three commonly used antiseptic agents to find an alternative to or supplementary concept for antiseptic treatment. The efficacy of two CAP generating devices ? the plasma jet kINPen09? and a hollow dielectric barrier electrode (HDBD) ? both working with argon with or without admixture of 1% oxygen, was compared with chlorhexidine digluconate (CHG 0.0001 and 0.00000625%), polyhexanide (PHMB 0.0001 and 0.000025%) and octenidine dihydrochloride (OCT 0.0002 and 0.00005%). The antiseptics were added to the planktonic stage of the biofilm-forming strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa SG 81, Staphylococcus epidermidis RP 62A, Streptococcus mutans DSM 20523 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 resp. SC 5314. The antiseptics were present during the subsequent cultivation period (32.5?h), whereas CAP was applied for only 60?s with the same cultivation period after the exposition. During the cultivation period, growth was measured every hour by optical density and analyzed with the calculated area under the curve (AUC) to determine the delay of exponential growth. Except for the higher resistance of C. albicans against PHMB and S. mutans against CHG, P. aeruginosa was the most resistant test organism against the other antiseptic treatments. OCT 0.0002% was the most effective among the tested antiseptic agents. The plasma jet did not differ from OCT in its efficacy against C. albicans and S. mutans. Against P. aeruginosa and both Candida strains, the plasma jet was more effective than against both Gram-positive test strains. In terms of efficacy against Candida spp., the HDBD (dielectric barrier discharge plasma) did not differ significantly from the plasma jet with argon plasma; in contrast, the bacteriostatic efficacy was significantly higher. While the addition of 1% O2 did not change the efficacy of the plasma jet, the efficacy of the HDBD against S. epidermidis increased significantly. The antimicrobial efficacy of CAP as demonstrated in earlier studies was confirmed with planktonic microorganisms showing delayed growth during cultivation for 32.5?h after a single application of CAP for 60?s. Short treatment with CAP could be an effective alternative or supplement to conventional antiseptics, for example, to inhibit the growth of microorganisms in an infected wound. OCT in the concentration used here showed the best microbial growth inhibitory results among the antiseptics.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the airway and perioperative management. Beta Blockers have potential beneficial effects when taken perioperatively. In addition to helping prevent/control arrhythmias, beta blockade also helps reduce myocardial oxygen demand that is produced by catecholamine release during stress periods. The most widely accepted theory of the continuation of statin therapy in the perioperative period is due to plaque stabilization. This is thought to occur secondary to the reduction of thrombin-induced expression and lipopolysaccharide induced expression of tissue factor. Assessment for difficult cricothyrotomy can be performed by patient history and physical examination. The mnemonic ?SMART? is a tool that can used to assess for difficulties that may occur: S: Surgery; M: Mass; A: Access or Anatomy; R: Radiation; and T: Tumor. Clinicians should be aware of identifiable factors in patients with difficult airways as these can dictate outcomes.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the acid-base, fluid, and electrolytes. Central diabetes insipidus (DI) is a failure of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) released from the posterior pituitary gland. Central DI manifests as polyuria with dilute urine in setting of hypertonic plasma. Failure of the urine osmolarity to increase after fluid restriction is diagnostic confirmation. Treatment is aimed at replacing free water deficits and vasopressin, an ADH analogue. Acidosis is from the loss of bicarbonate and not the addition of an acid, a normal anion gap is expected. A widened anion gap would be expected from an etiology that caused the addition of an acid. The loss of bicarbonate causes a gain of chloride ions to maintain electrical neutrality. Because of this, normal gap metabolic acidosis has also been referenced as ?hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis?. The treatment in this setting would be to replace fluids and electrolytes.

AB  - Abstract The versatile electrospinning technique is recognized as an efficient strategy to deliver active pharmaceutical ingredients and has gained tremendous progress in drug delivery, tissue engineering, cancer therapy, and disease diagnosis. Numerous drug delivery systems fabricated through electrospinning regarding the carrier compositions, drug incorporation techniques, release kinetics, and the subsequent therapeutic efficacy are presented herein. Targeting for distinct applications, the composition of drug carriers vary from natural/synthetic polymers/blends, inorganic materials, and even hybrids. Various drug incorporation approaches through electrospinning are thoroughly discussed with respect to the principles, benefits, and limitations. To meet the various requirements in actual sophisticated in vivo environments and to overcome the limitations of a single carrier system, feasible combinations of multiple drug-inclusion processes via electrospinning could be employed to achieve programmed, multi-staged, or stimuli-triggered release of multiple drugs. The therapeutic efficacy of the designed electrospun drug-eluting systems is further verified in multiple biomedical applications and is comprehensively overviewed, demonstrating promising potential to address a variety of clinical challenges.

AB  - Abstract In group-living species, individuals often have preferred affiliative social partners, with whom ties or bonds can confer advantages that correspond with greater fitness. For example, in adult female baboons and juvenile horses, individuals with stronger or more social ties experience greater survival. We used detailed behavioral and life history records to explore the relationship between tie quality and survival in a gregarious monkey (Cercopithecus mitis stuhlmanni), while controlling for dominance rank, group size, and life history strategy. We used Cox proportional hazards regressions to model the cumulative (multi-year) and current (single-year) relationships of social ties and the hazard of mortality in 83 wild adult females of known age, observed 2?8Â years each (437 subject-years) in eight social groups. The strength of bonds with close partners was associated with increased mortality risk under certain conditions: Females that had strong bonds with close partners that were inconsistent over multiple years had a higher risk of mortality than females adopting any other social strategy. Within a given year, females had a higher risk of death if they were strongly bonded with partners that changed from the previous year versus with partners that remained consistent. Dominance rank, number of adult female groupmates, and age at first reproduction did not predict the risk of death. This study demonstrates that costs and benefits of strong social bonds can be context-dependent, relating to the consistency of social partners over time.

AB  - Background and Objectives We have developed a light-activated technology for rapidly sealing skin surgical wounds called photochemical tissue bonding (PTB). The goals of this study were to evaluate parameters influencing PTB in order to optimize its clinical efficacy and to determine whether PTB can be used to seal wounds in moderately to highly pigmented skin. Study Design/Materials and Methods Application of Rose Bengal (RB) followed by exposure to 532?nm was used to seal linear incisions (1.5?mm deep, 2?cm long) in lightly pigmented (Yorkshire) and darkly pigmented (Yucatan) swine skin. The force required to open the seal (the bonding strength) was measured by in situ tensiometry. Reflectance spectra, epidermal transmission spectra, and histology were used to characterize the skin. The relationships of RB concentration and fluence to bonding strength were established in Yorkshire skin. Surface temperature was measured during irradiations and cooling was used while sealing incisions in Yucatan skin. Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to estimate the effect of epidermal melanin on the power absorbed in the dermis at the incision interface. Results The lowest fluence, 25?J/cm2, delivered at an irradiance of 0.5?W/cm2 substantially increased the bonding strength (?10-fold) compared to controls in Yorkshire swine skin. Increasing the fluence to 100?J/cm2 enhanced bonding strength by a further 1.5-fold. Application of 0.1% RB for 2?minutes produced the greatest bonding strength using 100?J/cm2 and limited the penetration of RB to an ?50??m band on the dermal incision wall. Reflectance spectra indicated that Yorkshire skin had minimal melanin and that Yucatan skin was a good model for highly pigmented human skin. In Yucatan skin, the bonding strength increased 1.7-fold using 0.1% RB and 200?J/cm2 at 1.5?W/cm2 with cooling and epinephrine. Monte Carlo simulation indicated that absorption of 532?nm light by epidermal melanin in dark skin decreased the power absorbed along the incision in the dermis by a factor of 2.7. Conclusions These results suggest that in lightly pigmented skin the PTB treatment time can be shortened without compromising the bonding strength. Sealing incisions using PTB in moderately and highly pigmented skin will require a careful balance of irradiance and cooling. Lasers Surg. Med. 47:17?29, 2015. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Arthrofibrosis is a common complication following total knee arthroplasty caused by pathologic fibroblast activation and excessive collagen deposition around a synovial joint leading to debilitating loss of motion. Treatment options are limited because the pathologic mechanisms remain to be characterized. Dysregulation of the inflammatory cascade may lead to communication between myofibroblasts and immune cells triggering tissue metaplasia, and excessive collagen deposition described clinically as arthrofibrosis. We explored the novel use of celecoxib (selective cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2] inhibitor) to disrupt the downstream effects of the post-traumatic inflammatory cascade and inhibit scar tissue formation in a validated rabbit model of arthrofibrosis combined with new parameters for quantifying the stiffness of the posterior capsule. Biomechanical and molecular analyses, of contracted rabbit knee posterior capsule tissue after COX-2 inhibition revealed increased maximal passive extension and down-regulation of collagen messenger RNA compared with controls. Histopathologic examination suggested a trend of decreased quantities of dense fibrous connective tissue with COX-2 inhibition. These data may suggest that inhibiting the inflammatory cascade could potentially reduce pathologic myofibroblast activation, thereby reducing scar tissue formation and increasing the range of motion in arthrofibrotic joints. Implementing a multi-modal pharmacologic approach may simultaneously target numerous cellular components contributing to the complex process of arthrofibrogenesis. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.

AB  - What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Urethral strictures, bladder neck and posterior urethral contractures, and urorectal fistulation are three well-recognised complications of the treatment of prostate cancer, whether by surgery or non-surgical treatment. Because these are relatively rare problems the treatment is uncertain. There is a heavy reliance on endoscopic or instrumental management of urethral strictures and of bladder neck and posterior urethral contractures, and there is little discrimination in any of these conditions between those that are the result of surgery and those that are the result of radiotherapy and other treatment methods using external energy sources. This review aims to clarify out current understanding of these three clinical problems and draws attention to the role of reconstructive surgery, particularly when dealing with bladder neck contractures, prostatic urethral stenoses and urorectal fistula. This also shows that the nature of the problem, the recovery time after treatment and the degree of functional recovery is radically different in the surgical as against the non-surgical group, to a degree that the authors believe is not sufficiently stressed when patients are counselled and consented before their primary treatment. ?? To review the less common and not widely discussed, but much more serious complications of prostate cancer treatment of: urethral stricture, bladder neck contracture and urorectal fistula. ?? The treatment options for patients with organ-confirmed prostate cancer include: radical prostatectomy (RP), brachytherapy (BT), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), high-intensity focussed ultrasound (HIFU) and cryotherapy; with each method or combination of methods having associated complications. ?? Complications resulting from RP are relatively easy to manage, with rapid recovery and return to normal activities, and usually a return to normal bodily functions. ?? However, after non-surgical treatments, i.e. BT, EBRT, HIFU and cryotherapy, these same problems are more difficult to treat with a much slower return to a much lower level of function. ?? When counselling patients about the primary treatment of prostate cancer they should be advised that although the same type of complication may occur after surgical or non-surgical treatment, the scope and scale of that complication, the ease with which it is treated and the degree of restoration of normality after treatment, is altogether in favour of surgery in those for whom surgery is appropriate and who are fit for surgery.
