AB  - Abstract In contrast with a thermal plasma surgical instrument based on coagulative and ablative properties, low-temperature (non-thermal) non-equilibrium plasmas are known for novel medicinal effects on exposed tissue while minimizing undesirable tissue damage. In this study we demonstrated that arrays of non-thermal microplasma jet devices fabricated from a transparent polymer can efficiently inactivate fungi (Candida albicans) as well as bacteria (Escherichia coli), both in vitro and in vivo, and that this leads to a significant wound-healing effect. Microplasma jet arrays offer several advantages over conventional single-jet devices, including superior packing density, inherent scalability for larger treatment areas, unprecedented material flexibility in a plasma jet device, and the selective generation of medically relevant reactive species at higher plasma densities. The therapeutic effects of our multi-jet device were verified on second-degree burns in animal rat models. Reduction of the wound area and the histology of the wound after treatment have been investigated, and expression of interleukin (IL)-1α, -6 and -10 was verified to evaluate the healing effects. The consistent effectiveness of non-thermal plasma treatment has been observed especially in decreasing wound size and promoting re-epithelialization through collagen arrangement and the regulation of expression of inflammatory genes.

AB  - The pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis) is an IUCN Red List Endangered species (CITES Appendix II) that has been housed in zoological collections since 1912. As wild populations continue to decline throughout the species? range, successful ex situ breeding and management, including an understanding of morbidity and mortality, are of utmost importance. This study is the first comprehensive review of mortality data from the captive population since 1982 and significantly expands on previous analyses. We solicited necropsy reports from 129/187 zoological institutions worldwide that currently or previously held pygmy hippos and received data for 404 animals (177 ?, 220 ?, 7 undermined sex), representing 43% of pygmy hippos that have died in captivity. Mortality in neonates was primarily due to perinatal causes (51.8%?stillbirth, failure to thrive, weakness, poor suckling reflex, maternal neglect) or parent-inflicted trauma (28%). Common causes of mortality in adult and geriatric animals included cardiovascular disease (16%), degenerative musculoskeletal conditions (10%), obstructive gastrointestinal disease (9%), and renal insufficiency (13%), sometimes associated with advanced polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Although not the direct cause of mortality, a number of adult and geriatric pygmy hippos were also overweight to obese. Infectious causes of mortality in included leptospirosis and encephalomyocarditis virus, the latter usually presenting as acute death due to cardiovascular demise. This comprehensive overview presents a useful guide for recommendations in preventative veterinary care and for improved husbandry and management of pygmy hippos in captivity.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Pleural effusion (PE) is reported to occur most commonly secondary to bacterial pneumonia or lung abscesses, with neoplastic effusions contributing the minority of cases. The majority of these reports originate from America and Australia, where long distance transport of horses, a recognised risk factor, appears to occur more frequently. Anecdotally, neoplastic PE is more commonly diagnosed in the UK. Objectives To describe the causes of PE in horses resident in the UK, and to identify potential markers that can help differentiate between infectious and neoplastic causes of PE. Study design Retrospective clinical study. Methods Medical records from 4 referral hospitals in southern England were searched for horses diagnosed with PE. Information gathered from medical records included signalment, diagnosis (infectious vs. neoplastic), admission physical examination and biochemical findings, and characteristics of the effusion (volume, cell count, total protein [TP] concentration). Statistical comparisons were made between the neoplastic and infectious group using appropriate testing. Results Seventy horses were identified, of which 28 (40%) were neoplastic and 42 were infectious. Horses with infectious effusions were significantly younger (median 7 vs. 13 years; P?=?0.002) and had significantly smaller volumes of pleural fluid drained at admission (9.8 vs. 32.3?l; P<0.001). Horses with infectious PE had a significantly higher rectal temperature (38.6 vs. 38.2°C; P?=?0.03), fibrinogen concentration (7.8 vs. 5.7?g/l; P?=?0.02) and serum amyloid A concentration (223 vs. 104?mg/l; P?=?0.02). Pleural fluid characteristics identified a significantly greater cell count and TP concentration in horses with infectious PE (47?x?109/l vs. 3.4?x?109/l; P<0.001; 54 vs. 31?g/l; P?=?0.001). Conclusions These results suggest that in the UK neoplastic effusions account for a greater proportion of PE than previously reported. A large volume of PE in an older horse with a low cell count and TP concentration should increase the index of suspicion of neoplasia. Ethical animal research:?This was a retrospective study of clinical cases. Explicit owner informed consent for inclusion of animals in this study was not stated. Source of funding:?None.

AB  - Summary Lymphoma, although rare, is the most common haematopoietic neoplasm encountered in horses and can occur at any age, with horses 4?10 years more commonly affected. Lymphoma can be classified into multicentric, alimentary, mediastinal, cutaneous and solitary. Clinical signs are typically nonspecific until the disease has progressed to end-stage at which time clinical signs reflect function of organ(s) involved. Horses with the cutaneous form of lymphoma typically present with multifocal skin lesions and no other clinical signs. Like the nonspecific clinical signs of lymphoma, results of complete blood count (CBC) and serum biochemistries are not often helpful with diagnosis, but lymphoma should be considered if anaemia, hyperfibrinogenaemia, hyperproteinaemia and hypoalbuminaemia are observed without a clear indication of infectious disease. Identification of neoplastic lymphocytes during cytological examination of a body cavity effusion can confirm the presence of lymphoma. Typically, ante mortem confirmation of lymphoma is made through histopathological examination of a biopsy or cytological examination of a fine needle aspirate of a suspected lesion. Observation of compression or destruction of normal tissue architecture by invading neoplastic cells during histological examination is indicative of lymphoma. Additional diagnostics that may improve our knowledge of equine lymphoma include detection of hormone receptors, immunophenotyping, and immunohistochemical analysis for tumour proliferation rates. Prognosis of horses with lymphoma depends on the form of lymphoma and stage at which the horse is presented but death is the common outcome of this disease. Current treatment options are surgical excision, radiation or administration of chemotherapeutic drugs. Treatment of horses with lymphoma can result in palliation and occasional resolution of this disease. Equine oncology is in its infancy, but through further documentation of horses with lymphoma and their response to therapy, a clearer understanding of the disease process and effective treatment of this neoplasm can be developed.

Improper application, however, may impede healing and be detrimental to the well-being or athletic future of the horse. Many different types of bandage materials exist and are reviewed in Chapter 6. This chapter is devoted to the principles and techniques of bandaging and casting. Splinting is discussed along with casting because either approach may be used when immobilization is required to support wound healing. Various techniques to improve the application and maintenance of bandages, splints, and casts, as well as to manage complications arising from their use, are discussed.

AB  - Summary Dyspnoea is a common presenting symptom in the older patient and is often multifactorial, with a wide differential of contributing pathologies. Dyspnoea is a distressing symptom and significantly impacts on quality of life. Older adults with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease may present with a disturbance in daily function and mental status rather more typical symptoms experienced in younger patients. Cardiac failure in older patients has a high mortality and management strategies may be complicated by other comorbidities, especially renal failure. Increasing numbers of patients are dying of end stage lung disease and may present to the Emergency Department requiring palliation of their symptoms. This chapter includes: A focus on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiac failure: including presentation, investigations and potential therapies in the older patient A discussion on the role of non-invasive and invasive ventilation in the older adult with respiratory failure A guideline to the management of end-stage lung disease in the acute setting

AB  - Summary This chapter provides a brief summary of natural history of ursids and practical information on medical management, including the most prevalent concerns for each species and the epidemiology of infectious and parasitic diseases. It focuses entirely on black bears and practitioners are encouraged to consult with brown bear and polar bears experts if working with these species. Bears may require veterinary and rehabilitation assistance for a variety of reasons. The most common causes of admission include orphaning, regulated and nonregulated hunting, weather events, vehicular collisions, dog interactions, and nuisance events. Trauma is a frequent finding on physical exam and surgical intervention is often required. Skin abrasions and lacerations, fractured bones, broken teeth, and damage to internal organs are common injuries in bears. As for any wild animal undergoing medical care or rehabilitation, established criteria should be met before contemplating release.

AB  - Summary Correct pulpal diagnosis is the key to all endodontic treatments. It is paramount to have established a clinical diagnosis of the pulp and the periapical tissue prior cutting access into the pulp chamber or to do any other treatment to a tooth. Clinical signs and symptoms, diagnostic tests in addition to a comprehensive knowledge of the reaction of the pulp to caries, operative manipulations, trauma, and periodontal disease, enable us to establish an empirical pulp diagnosis only. The history of symptoms for the diagnosis of reversible pulpitis will mainly reveal provoked pain or sensation, and the tooth will only bother the patient when the tooth is exposed to a hot and/or cold or other excitatory stimuli. Like pulpal inflammation, the periapical inflammation can be symptom-free and only diagnosed in a chronic phase on a periapical radiograph. Determining the endodontic diagnosis prior to any invasive endodontic, or even any dental, procedure is paramount.

AB  - Single- and multi-unit recordings were obtained from the medial articular nerve (m.a.n.) of knee joints in the anaesthetized dog. The single-unit recordings were confined to low threshold (group I and II) articular mechanoreceptors. Multi-unit recordings revealed that the m.a.n. discharge was maximal in extension, submaximal in flexion, and minimal at intermediate angles, i.e. a U-shaped profile. Subatmospheric intra-articular pressures do not appear to influence the m.a.n. discharge. Intra-articular infusion of even small quantities of fluid, although not affecting the U-shaped profile, reversed the m.a.n. discharge pattern with maximum neural activity occurring in flexion and being submaximal in extension. Recordings from single units indicated that the enhanced discharge after fluid infusion was a result of increased discharge frequency and 'recruitment' of individual afferents.

AB  - Summary Inter-hospital transportation takes place in three distinct phases. Firstly, the patient is moved from the referring unit to the transferring vehicle. Secondly, the vehicle, team and patient move from the referring unit to the receiving unit. Finally, the patient is moved from the transferring vehicle to the receiving unit trolley or bed. There are many potential problems during any transfer, some are specific to the clinical condition of the individual patient, the equipment being used or the mode of transport. For each of the systems (physiological, technological and logistic) undertake a pre-transfer check before leaving. Most transport ventilators display airway pressure on an aneroid dial or digital display. It is important for the transfer team to have access to a range of monitoring parameters in order to evaluate the effects of the transfer environment on organ perfusion and the cardiovascular system.

AB  - Abstract New quantum theory completed the fall of the 19th century edifice of science and seemed to bar any new edifice based on Baconian scientific method and the deterministic systematics of scientific knowledge. The trauma of relativism, indeterminacy, and operational probabilism that inspired the growth of the Vienna Circle occurred as the academic citadel of science was destroyed by political and economic upheaval. Operational reunification of the sciences by quantum theory has proceeded for decades, but new normative thinking is needed to survive backlash from an age of Big Science. Quantum biology and some potentials of other research are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Transgenic plants offer many advantages, including low cost of production (by elimination of fermenters), storage and transportation; heat stability; and absence of human pathogens. When therapeutic proteins are orally delivered, plant cells protect antigens in the stomach through bioencapsulation and eliminate the need for expensive purification and sterile injections, in addition to development of both systemic and mucosal immunity. Chloroplast genetic engineering offers several advantages, including high levels of transgene expression, transgene containment via maternal inheritance and multi-gene expression in a single transformation event. Hyper-expression of vaccine antigens against cholera, tetanus, anthrax, plague or canine parvovirus (4?31% of total soluble protein, tsp) in transgenic chloroplasts (leaves) or non-green plastids (carrots, tomato), as well as the availability of antibiotic-free selectable markers or the ability to excise selectable marker genes, facilitate oral delivery. Hyper-expression of several therapeutic proteins, including human serum albumin (11.1% tsp), somatotropin (7% tsp), interferon-gamma (6% tsp), anti-microbial peptide (21.5% tsp), facilitates efficient and economic purification. Also, the presence of chaperones and enzymes in chloroplasts facilitate assembly of complex multi-subunit proteins and correct folding of human blood proteins with proper disulfide bonds. Functionality of chloroplast-derived vaccine antigens and therapeutic proteins has been demonstrated by several assays, including the macrophage lysis assay, GM1-ganglioside binding assay, protection of HeLa cells or human lung carcinoma cells against encephalomyocarditis virus, systemic immune response, protection against pathogen challenge, and growth or inhibition of cell cultures. Thus, transgenic chloroplasts are ideal bioreactors for production of functional human and animal therapeutic proteins in an environmentally friendly manner.

AB  - Radio-activated gene therapy has been developed as a novel therapeutic strategy against cancer; however, expression of therapeutic gene in peritumoral tissues will result in unacceptable toxicity to normal cells. To restrict gene expression in targeted tumor mass, we used hypoxia and radiation tolerance features of tumor cells to develop a synthetic AND gate genetic circuit through connecting radiation sensitivity promoter cArG6, heat shock response elements SNF1, HSF1 and HSE4 with retroviral vector plxsn. Their construction and dynamic activity process were identified through downstream enhanced green fluorescent protein and wtp53 expression in non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells and in a nude mice model. The result showed that AND gate genetic circuit could be activated by lower required radiation dose (6 Gy) and after activated, AND gate could induce significant apoptosis effects and growth inhibition of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The radiation- and hypoxia-activated AND gate genetic circuit, which could lead to more powerful target tumoricidal activity represented a promising strategy for both targeted and effective gene therapy of human lung adenocarcinoma and low dose activation character of the AND gate genetic circuit implied that this model could be further exploited to decrease side-effects of clinical radiation therapy.
