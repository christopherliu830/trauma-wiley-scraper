AB  - Summary This chapter reviews the most common and representative neurological disorders that dentists are likely to see in dental practice. The disorders include Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), traumatic brain injury, and epilepsy. For each disorder/disease, first a detailed background is given before focusing on medical and dental management and treatment. Under medical management section, a set of key questions that have to be asked to the physician and a set of questions that need to be asked to the patient, are listed. Under dental management, risks of dental care, susceptibility to infection, drug actions/interactions, and the patient's ability to tolerate dental care, are described.

AB  - There is an orderly topographic arrangement of neurones within auditory brainstem nuclei based on sound frequency. Previous immunolabelling studies in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) have suggested that there may be gradients of voltage-gated currents underlying this tonotopic arrangement. Here, our electrophysiological and immunolabelling results demonstrate that underlying the tonotopic organization of the MNTB is a combination of medio-lateral gradients of low-and high-threshold potassium currents and hyperpolarization-activated cation currents. Our results also show that the intrinsic membrane properties of MNTB neurones produce a topographic gradient of time delays, which may be relevant to sound localization, following previous demonstrations of the importance of the timing of inhibitory input from the MNTB to the medial superior olive (MSO). Most importantly, we demonstrate that, in the MNTB of congenitally deaf mice, which exhibit no spontaneous auditory nerve activity, the normal tonotopic gradients of neuronal properties are absent. Our results suggest an underlying mechanism for the observed topographic gradient of neuronal firing properties in the MNTB, show that an intrinsic neuronal mechanism is responsible for generating a topographic gradient of time-delays, and provide direct evidence that these gradients rely on spontaneous auditory nerve activity during development.

AB  - Summary Background Nutraceuticals are often used in the management of equine osteoarthritis, but scientific evidence of their efficacy is lacking. Objectives To study the preventive effects of two new nutraceuticals after the experimental induction of synovitis in comparison with positive and negative control treatments. Study design Blinded, controlled, randomised experiment. Methods Twenty-four healthy Standardbred horses were randomly allocated to supplement AT (multi-ingredient, 28 days), supplement HP (collagen hydrolysate, 60 days), meloxicam (4 days) or placebo (60 days). Synovitis was induced in the right intercarpal joint by intra-articular injection of 0.5 ng lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Escherichia coli while treatments were continued. Blood and synovial fluid were sampled before treatment, immediately prior to LPS injection, and at 8, 24 and 48 h post-injection. Synovial fluid samples were analysed for total nucleated cell count (TNCC), total protein (TP) and selected biomarkers (prostaglandin E2 [PGE2], interleukin-6 [IL-6], glycosaminoglycans [GAGs], type II collagen synthesis [CPII], matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]). Lameness was scored by visual examination and pressure plate analysis immediately prior to LPS injection, and at 8, 24 and 48 h post-injection. Clinical examinations were performed before treatment, immediately prior to LPS injection, at 2, 4 and 6 h post-injection, and then twice per day during the test period. Results Before treatment and intra-articular challenge, there were no statistically significant differences among the treatment groups for any of the parameters. After intra-articular challenge, the placebo group showed significantly higher synovial fluid TP, TNCC and PGE2 compared with the meloxicam group, although the model did not induce a relevant amount of lameness. Both nutraceuticals resulted in significantly lower synovial fluid TP, TNCC and PGE2 compared with placebo. No statistical differences in IL-6, GAGs, CPII or MMPs were observed among treatment groups. No adverse effects were observed. Main limitations Despite evidence of synovitis, lameness was too mild to detect. Conclusions The preventive administration of these nutraceuticals showed anti-inflammatory effects in this validated synovitis model. Therefore, further studies of their clinical applicability are warranted.

AB  - Summary The main purpose of this study was to describe the effect of glucose infusion on selected physiological variables and on the duration of treadmill exercise to fatigue. Six, 3?4 year old, clinically normal, Standardbred fillies were used in a randomised and balanced crossover design. The treatments were either an infusion of glucose (an initial bolus followed by an infusion rate adjusted during exercise to maintain glucose at approximately 9.0 mmol/l) or an infusion of a similar volume of normal saline. Saline was also infused during the first 30 min of recovery in both treatments. Treadmill speed and grade were 6.0 m/s and 2°. All horses underwent an exercise and dietary control period for 3 days prior to each treatment. A period of 7?10 days separated the treatments. Treadmill exercise duration was prolonged with glucose (89.8 min ± 15.4 s.e.m.) compared to saline (78.7 ± 12.4 min) (P<0.05). Plasma glucose concentrations were similar at rest and increased (P<0.05) above resting concentrations throughout exercise beginning at 15 min and 35 min for the glucose and saline trials, respectively. By 15 min of exercise, glucose concentrations were 8.72 ± 0.22 and 5.78 ± 0.28 mmol/l (P<0.05) for the glucose and the saline trials, respectively. Changes in haematocrit, plasma lactate, plasma total solids, plasma electrolytes, heart rate, core temperature, body weight and body water loss were similar for both treatments. An explanation for the glucose-induced prolongation of exercise could be the availability of additional substrate during exercise.

AB  - The emerging field of soft robotics makes use of many classes of materials including metals, low glass transition temperature (Tg) plastics, and high Tg elastomers. Dependent on the specific design, all of these materials may result in extrinsically soft robots. Organic elastomers, however, have elastic moduli ranging from tens of megapascals down to kilopascals; robots composed of such materials are intrinsically soft ? they are always compliant independent of their shape. This class of soft machines has been used to reduce control complexity and manufacturing cost of robots, while enabling sophisticated and novel functionalities often in direct contact with humans. This review focuses on a particular type of intrinsically soft, elastomeric robot ? those powered via fluidic pressurization.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Colic is the most common equine emergency problem, and one of the main causes of equid deaths. The horse owners' ability to recognise colic is a critical first step in determining case outcome. Objectives To assess equine owners' knowledge and recognition of colic. Study design Online questionnaire of horse owners. Methods An online survey was designed to evaluate owners' approach to colic in the horse. The survey included questions on owner demographics, their recognition of colic (including owner's opinions of their ability to recognise colic, their approach, and their recognition of colic using case vignettes), and their knowledge of normal ranges for clinical parameters. Descriptive and chi squared statistical analysis was performed. Results The survey was completed by 1061 UK respondents. Six per cent of owners thought they could recognise all types of colic, 61% said they could recognise most cases and 30% said they could recognise some but not all cases. Owners said they would assess faecal output (73% of respondents), gastrointestinal sounds (69%), respiratory rate (62%) and heart rate (50%) in horses with suspected colic. One fifth (22%) of owners would call a vet immediately without assessing any parameters. Many respondents either did not know, or provided incorrect estimates of normal values for clinical parameters: 30.4% were ?unsure? of the normal heart rate and 35.5% gave heart rate values which were outside reference ranges; only 24.5% gave appropriate values for normal respiratory rates and only 31% gave normal temperature values. There was no statistical significance between participants' age, educational qualifications, or their experience with horses and their knowledge of normal clinical parameters. Conclusions Owners varied in their approach and ability to recognise colic, and many had significant gaps in their knowledge of normal parameters. Educational materials and/or training to assist owners could help address these issues. Ethical animal research:?The study did not involve animal research. The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee, School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. The questionnaire was conducted in accordance with the 1998 Data Protection Act, and the British Educational Research Association's Revised Ethical Guidelines for Educational Research (2004). Source of funding:?Adelle Bowden's studentship is funded by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Purpose Since Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) data acquisition and processing are not standardized, substantial differences in DWI derived measures such as Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) may arise which are related to the acquisition or MRI processing method, but not to the sample under study. Quality assurance using a standardized test object, or phantom, is a key factor in standardizing DWI across scanners. Methods Current diffusion phantoms are either complex to use, not available in larger quantities, contain substances unwanted in a clinical environment, or are expensive. A diffusion phantom based on a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) solution, together with a phantom holder, is presented and compared to existing diffusion phantoms for use in clinical DWI scans. An ADC vs. temperature calibration curve was obtained. Results ADC of the phantom (808 to 857 ± 0.2 mm2/s) is in the same range as ADC values found in brain tissue. ADC measurements are highly reproducible across time with an intra-class correlation coefficient of > 0.8. ADC as function of temperature (in Kelvin) can be estimated as with a total uncertainty (95% confidence limit) of ± 1.7%. Conclusion We present an isotropic diffusion MRI phantom, together with its temperature calibration curve, that is easy-to-use in a clinical environment, cost-effective, reproducible to produce, and that contains no harmful substances.

AB  - Summary An abdominal wall defect created by intentionally leaving an abdominal incision open at the completion of surgery, or by opening or re-opening the abdomen for abdominal compartment syndrome. Abdominal wall tissue loss following trauma or tumour also produces significant defects. This chapter first presents some key notes on management of the open abdomen. It then discusses perineal reconstruction and hypospadias. Perineal reconstruction is indicated in these circumstances: extensive skin loss; vaginal resection; pelvic or perineal dead space; excision of the pelvic floor; and excision after radiotherapy. The chapter also presents brief discussions of bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex, ambiguous genitalia, vaginal agenesis and penile reconstruction.
