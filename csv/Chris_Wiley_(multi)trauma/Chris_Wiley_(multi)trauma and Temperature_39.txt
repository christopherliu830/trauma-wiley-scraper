AB  - Summary An abdominal wall defect created by intentionally leaving an abdominal incision open at the completion of surgery, or by opening or re-opening the abdomen for abdominal compartment syndrome. Abdominal wall tissue loss following trauma or tumour also produces significant defects. This chapter first presents some key notes on management of the open abdomen. It then discusses perineal reconstruction and hypospadias. Perineal reconstruction is indicated in these circumstances: extensive skin loss; vaginal resection; pelvic or perineal dead space; excision of the pelvic floor; and excision after radiotherapy. The chapter also presents brief discussions of bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex, ambiguous genitalia, vaginal agenesis and penile reconstruction.

AB  - Abstract Minimally invasive techniques enable diagnostics and surgery to be performed through a small incision. This greatly reduces the damage to healthy tissue leading to faster recovery times for the patient. However, the surgeon is deprived of the sensory feedback available with normal surgical techniques. Miniaturised sensors can provide this information about location, diagnostics and the treatment. This application severely limits the size of the device, with some catheters being less than 1 mm in diameter. Catheters are usually defined in multiples of 1/3 mm or 1 french. Further important issues are bio-compatibility, safety and the ability of the sensor to withstand the working environment. Sensors able to meet these demands are improving the efficiency of operations and are opening new opportunities for minimally invasive techniques.

AB  - Summary Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the fingernails and/or toenails caused by dermatophytes, yeasts and non-dermatophyte moulds. The epidemiology of onychomycosis in Serbia is yet to be fully established. This epidemiological study was aimed at evaluating the epidemiology of onychomycosis in a sample of the Serbian patients at risk of onychomycosis, to determine the fungal aetiological agents and to identify the possible risk factors. The study population included 374 patients from six centres in Serbia with suspected onychomycosis. Demographic data, data about comorbidities, lifestyle, clinical aspects of onychomycosis, trauma, excessive perspiration and personal and family history of previous onychomycosis were studied. Laboratory confirmation of diagnosis was done by direct microscopy, fungal culture and PCR. Diagnosis of onychomycosis was confirmed in 50.8% of patients, who tested positive to at least one laboratory test (direct microscopy, fungal culture or PCR). Trichophyton rubrum was predominant both on toenails (85.98%) and on fingernails (38.46%). Independent risk factors for onychomycosis were: old age (OR = 2.285; P < 0.001), family history of previous onychomycosis and/or tinea pedis (OR = 2.452; P = 0.005), excessive perspiration (OR = 2.165; P = 0.002) and higher degree of hyperkeratosis (OR = 1.755; P = 0.020). This is a first epidemiological study of onychomycosis from Serbia.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the analgesia and anesthesia. Dexmedetomidine is a sedative, analgesic, and anxiolytic that is an agonist on the central alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. It does not cause respiratory depression, and can be used in patients who are not intubated. Dexmedetomidine provides anesthesia without decreasing respiratory drive. It works through the central nervous system (CNS), as an alpha-2 receptor agonist. The manifestations of local analgesia toxicity start with tachycardia and hypertension. As blood levels continue to rise, symptoms can continue to progress to myocardial depression, hypertension, and decreased cardiac output. Ketamine is classified as a dissociative anesthetic. It produces amnesia and analgesia. Propofol can be used in patients with neurologic injury. It can decrease intracranial pressure, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral metabolism.

AB  - Summary Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in around10-20%of patients admitted to hospital, and is most often due to hypovolaemia/hypotension, sepsis and nephrotoxins. This chapter summarizes stage-based management of AKI. It also summarizes monitoring and supportive care in AKI. Three common scenarios are encountered: corrected hypovolaemia/hypotension, with improving renal function; persisting/worsening AKI despite correction of hypovolaemia/hypotension and removal of nephrotoxins; and suspected urinary tract obstruction. Prompt and vigorous correction of hypovolaemia and hypotension will often reverse AKI. If there is clinically obvious hypovolaemia, IV fluid is given. Treatment of the trigger of deterioration and avoidance of hypovolaemia (preferably by albumin administration) can help to decrease the incidence of AKI. A CVP line may be helpful (to avoid over-replacement of fluid), but the patient should be resuscitated first before this is placed. Ultrasonography of the inferior vena cava is one of the methods to assess the CVP.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the methodology for and utilization of tissue oxygen monitoring by near infrared spectroscopy, and to review the current literature on the use of this monitoring modality in human and veterinary settings. Data Sources Scientific reviews and original research found using the PubMed and CAB Abstract search engines with the following keywords: ?tissue oxygen monitoring,? ?near-infrared tissue spectroscopy,? and ?tissue oxygen saturation (StO2).? Human Data Synthesis Tissue oxygen monitors have been evaluated in a wide variety of human clinical applications including trauma and triage, surgery, sepsis, and septic shock, and early goal-directed therapy. StO2 more rapidly identifies occult shock in human patients compared to traditional methods, which can lead to earlier intervention in these patients. Veterinary Data Synthesis Veterinary studies involving tissue oxygen monitoring are limited, but the technology may have utility for identification of hemorrhagic shock earlier than changes in base excess, blood lactate concentration, or other traditional perfusion parameters. Conclusion Tissue oxygen monitoring is most commonly performed utilizing a noninvasive, portable monitor, which provides real-time, continuous, repeatable StO2 measurements. A decline in StO2 is an early indicator of shock in both human and veterinary patients. Low StO2 values in human patients are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and length of hospitalization, as well as the development of multiple organ system dysfunction and surgical site infections.

Study Design Prospective cohort study. Animals Client-owned cats (n?=?17) with MHE. Methods Cats diagnosed with MHE, based on clinical signs, radiographs and computed tomography (CT), were prospectively recruited. Cats were treated conservatively for an initial 4 weeks, followed by either surgery or continued conservative treatment. Followup examinations were performed at 6 and 12 weeks and at 6?49 months. Results Cats had a mean age of 10.3 years and presented for chronic lameness. Examination revealed pain on palpation caudodistal to the medial epicondyle and by exerting antebrachial supination/pronation with elbow and carpal flexion. Lameness was restricted to 1 limb although CT revealed bilateral disease in 11/17 cats. Free mineralized joint bodies were identified in 9/17 cats. Nine cats were treated surgically and 8 cats were treated conservatively. Intraoperative findings included new bone formation at the origin of the humeral head of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle with displacement and adhesions of the ulnar nerve. Microscopic examination revealed neurogenic myopathy in 4/9 cats treated surgically. Seven of 9 cats treated surgically were free from lameness by 12 weeks. Seven of 8 cats treated conservatively were chronically lame throughout the study. Conclusions Cats with forelimb lameness should be evaluated for MHE. This condition is associated with free joint bodies and neurogenic myopathy. Surgical treatment is associated with excellent outcome in the majority of cats.

AB  - Background Friction blister research has focused on prevention and treatment approaches rather than exploring the pathophysiology of the friction blister. Increased skin hydration has been purported to be a key risk factor in friction blister development. This study aimed to test the effect of increased skin surface hydration on the risk of friction blister creation. Methods The skin on one foot was hydrated by soaking the foot in water. Intermittent loading was carried out until an observable change of 3°C was evident using infrared thermography. The contra lateral foot acted as a control. Skin hydration and elasticity was measured using electrical capacitance and negative pressure respectively. Results The rate of temperature change of the hydrated group was significantly greater than that of the non-hydrated foot group (P = 0.001) and showed a strong positive correlation (r = 0.520) with skin surface hydration. Weak negative correlations were seen between skin elasticity and rate of temperature change in response to load application (r = ?0.166) and skin surface hydration and elasticity at baseline (r = ?0.195). Conclusion In controlled experimental conditions increased skin surface hydration increases the rate of temperature change of the skin in response to load application and consequently increases the risk of blister creation.

AB  - Case Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) caused by Clostridium butyricum is common in neonates; however, a case of NEC in adults has not been previously reported. An 84-year-old Japanese man developed C. butyricum-related NEC during hospitalization for treatment of stab wounds to the left side of the neck and lower abdomen, without organ damage, and concomitant pneumonia. Outcome The patient developed acute onset of emesis accompanied by shock during his admission; partial resection of the small intestine was carried out due to necrosis. Pathologic findings showed mucosal necrosis and extensive vacuolation with gram-positive rods in the necrotic small intestine. Blood culture tests revealed C. butyricum infection. The patient's condition improved after the surgery. He was moved to a rehabilitation hospital on day 66. Conclusion This study suggests that hospitalized adult patients who receive antibiotic treatment are at risk for NEC.

Study Design Case report. Animals A 10-week-old composite bull calf. Methods Using Paley's principles of angular limb deformity correction, a cylindrical osteotomy was performed to concurrently correct varus deformity and external torsion of the metatarsus. The limb was aligned and stabilized using two 3.5?mm broad LCP with locking head screws. Results The calf was immediately weight bearing after surgery and did not experience any postoperative complications. Follow-up radiographs 5 months postoperatively revealed complete osteotomy healing and remodeling. The limb was in good alignment, the calf was fully weight bearing, and client satisfaction was very high. Telephone follow-up with the owner 16 months after surgery revealed continued full use of the operated limb and the bull was being used in a pasture breeding program. Conclusions Cylindrical osteotomy with LCP stabilization can provide a favorable outcome in angular and torsional metatarsal deformity correction in cattle.

AB  - Inhibition of cAMP-dependent stimulation of vectorial fluid transport across the alveolar epithelium following haemorrhagic shock is mediated by reactive nitrogen species released within the airspaces of the lung. We tested here the hypothesis that the prior activation of the cellular heat shock or stress response, via exposure to either heat or geldanamycin, would attenuate the release of airspace nitric oxide (NO) responsible for the shock-mediated failure of the alveolar epithelium to respond to catecholamines in rats. Rats were haemorrhaged to a mean arterial pressure of 30?35 mmHg for 60 min, and then resuscitated with a 4 % albumin solution. Alveolar fluid clearance was measured by change in concentration of a protein solution instilled into the airspaces 5 h after the onset of haemorrhage. Stress preconditioning restored the cAMP-mediated upregulation of alveolar liquid clearance after haemorrhage. The protective effect of stress preconditioning was mediated in part by a decrease in the expression of iNOS in the lung. Specifically, stress preconditioning decreased the production of nitrite by endotoxin-stimulated alveolar macrophages removed from haemorrhaged rats or by A549 and rat alveolar epithelial type II cell monolayers stimulated with cytomix (a mixture of TNF-α, IL-1? and IFN-?) for 24 h. In summary, these results provide the first in vivo evidence that stress preconditioning restores a normal fluid transport capacity of the alveolar epithelium in the early phase following haemorrhagic shock by attenuating NO-mediated oxidative stress to the lung epithelium.
