AB  - Summary Purpose Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children, and early posttraumatic seizures (EPTS) are a contributing factor to ongoing acute damage. Continuous video-EEG monitoring (cEEG) was utilized to assess the burden of clinical and electrographic EPTS. Methods Eighty-seven consecutive, unselected (mild ? severe), acute TBI patients requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission at two academic centers were monitored prospectively with cEEG per established clinical TBI protocols. Clinical and subclinical seizures and status epilepticus (SE, clinical and subclinical) were assessed for their relation to clinical risk factors and short-term outcome measures. Key Findings Of all patients, 42.5% (37/87) had seizures. Younger age (p = 0.002) and injury mechanism (abusive head trauma ? AHT, p < 0.001) were significant risk factors. Subclinical seizures occurred in 16.1% (14/87), while 6.9% (6/87) had only subclinical seizures. Risk factors for subclinical seizures included younger age (p < 0.001), AHT (p < 0.001), and intraaxial bleed (p < 0.001). SE occurred in 18.4% (16/87) with risk factors including younger age (p < 0.001), AHT (p < 0.001), and intraaxial bleed (p = 0.002). Subclinical SE was detected in 13.8% (12/87) with significant risk factors including younger age (p < 0.001), AHT (p = 0.001), and intraaxial bleed (p = 0.004). Subclinical seizures were associated with lower discharge King's Outcome Scale for Childhood Head Injury (KOSCHI) score (p = 0.002). SE and subclinical SE were associated with increased hospital length of stay (p = 0.017 and p = 0.041, respectively) and lower hospital discharge KOSCHI (p = 0.007 and p = 0.040, respectively). Significance cEEG monitoring significantly improves detection of seizures/SE and is the only way to detect subclinical seizures/SE. cEEG may be indicated after pediatric TBI, particularly in younger children, AHT cases, and those with intraaxial blood on computerized tomography (CT).

AB  - This paper reviews the management of head injuries arising in the rural and remote areas of Queensland. Methodology? Data was obtained from the Queensland Trauma Registry from January 2003 to December 2004, a total of 3,088 patients, 1667 classified as major injury. Queensland is the second largest state in Australia with most of the 4 million population living along the eastern seaboard, mainly in the southeast corner and a widely dispersed rural population in small towns. There are neurosurgical services in Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Townsville. Results? Forty percent of patients are referred from another hospital for definitive care with transfer times of up to 10 hours between the referring and definitive care hospital. Of those requiring craniotomy 60% of patients are referred from a another hospital again with lengthy transfer times well beyond the 2 hour transfer time for the deteriorating head injury with intracranial haemorrhage as recommended in the NSA/RACS set of guidelines for the ?Management of Acute Neurotrauma in Rural and Remote Locations?. This paper reviews the problems which include deficient retrieval resources, a reluctance by non-neurosurgeons to perform emergency neurosurgery, a lack of training amongst younger surgeons, and perceived medicolegal issues. The paper also compares the situation in other states and territories. Conclusions? Recommendations are made to improve the delivery of neurotrama care.

AB  - Abstract Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare and often fatal soft-tissue infection involving the superficial fascial layers of the extremities, abdomen or perineum. Progression to septic shock can occur very rapidly with its associated high morbidity and mortality. NF is usually caused by beta haemolytic streptococci; less often a poly-microbial isolate is the cause. It typically occurs in patients with some degree of immune dysfunction. We present a case of severe pneumococcal necrotizing fasciitis in an obese patient with Type 2 diabetes. There was no history of trauma or evidence of diabetes-related complications. The initial presentation was with features of septic arthritis of the left knee, which subsequently progressed to NF. Differentiation from cellulitis is often difficult in the early stages. Invasive pneumococcal infections are extremely rare, with only a few reported in the literature. Moreover, our case highlights the need to consider other differential diagnoses (and to look out for complications) in patients with diabetes, especially if there is little clinical response to the initial treatment.

AB  - Abstract The cochlear implant (CI) is the first effective treatment for deafness and severe losses in hearing. As such, the CI is now widely regarded as one of the great advances in modern medicine. This article reviews the key events and discoveries that led up to the current CI systems, and we review and present some among the many possibilities for further improvements in device design and performance. The past achievements include: (1) development of reliable devices that can be used over the lifetime of a patient; (2) development of arrays of implanted electrodes that can stimulate more than one site in the cochlea; and (3) progressive and large improvements in sound processing strategies for CIs. In addition, cooperation between research organizations and companies greatly accelerated the widespread availability and use of safe and effective devices. Possibilities for the future include: (1) use of otoprotective drugs; (2) further improvements in electrode designs and placements; (3) further improvements in sound processing strategies; (4) use of stem cells to replace lost sensory hair cells and neural structures in the cochlea; (5) gene therapy; (6) further reductions in the trauma caused by insertions of electrodes and other manipulations during implant surgeries; and (7) optical rather electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. Each of these possibilities is the subject of active research. Although great progress has been made to date in the development of the CI, including the first substantial restoration of a human sense, much more progress seems likely and certainly would not be a surprise.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents a case of 83-year-old woman who brought to the emergency department (ED) via emergency medical services (EMSs) after being found wandering the streets in her nightgown. With the aging of world's population, the prevalence of elder abuse and neglect will increase. Increased educational efforts for healthcare providers, leading to increased awareness of this societal problem, are needed to protect our elderly patients. Treat the presenting condition and then mobilize the support services to ensure that the elderly person will be cared for appropriately when discharged. The difficult part is recognizing that the elderly patient's condition is due to abuse or neglect. One of the important points in the recognition of elder abuse is that there is no stereotypical victim. There are several screening tools to facilitate the detection of elder abuse. One that is easy to complete in the ED is the Elder Abuse Suspicion Index (EASI).

AB  - Objective To investigate the physiologic reactions after removal of 1st ovary and whether this is repeated during removal of the 2nd ovary in elective ovariohysterectomy. Study Design Prospective study. Animals Dogs (n?=?10). Methods Dogs were premedicated with acepromazine, carprofen, and methadone and anesthetized with propofol and isoflurane. Blood pressure, heart rate, and end-tidal isoflurane concentration were measured every minute. The effects of various events during surgery on physiologic variables were analyzed using mixed linear models. Blood and urine samples were collected before anesthesia, before incision, before and after removal of ovaries with a 15?minute pause between ovary removal, and after abdominal closure. Plasma vasopressin and urinary noradrenalin and creatinine concentrations were analyzed. Results The magnitude of blood pressure increase at removal of the 1st ovary was greater than for the 2nd ovary because of an elevation in baseline. Similarly, the heart rate increased at the removal of the 1st ovary but not at removal of the 2nd ovary. Plasma vasopressin concentration increased at removal of both ovaries. Urinary noradrenalin/creatinine ratio increased at anesthesia, removal of both ovaries, and was elevated at closure of the abdomen. End-tidal isoflurane concentration did not change. Blood pressure and vasopressin concentrations changed in parallel using z-scores for comparison. Conclusions Peak values for blood pressure, heart rate, plasma vasopressin concentration, and urinary noradrenalin/creatinine ratio did not differ between removals of the ovaries. Relative changes differed between repeated noxious stimuli, which should be considered in evaluation of methods at ovary removal.

AB  - Summary Veterinary technicians play an important role in preoperative planning by performing tests and providing the veterinary surgeon and anesthesia staff with the results. They also follow the veterinarian's orders by calculating medication dosage, filling prescriptions, and administering medications. Preoperative tests include complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry panel, and urinalysis. A database of a packed cell volume (PCV), total protein and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and blood glucose via a glucometer provides the minimal information required prior to surgery. In addition to the common blood and urine tests, a variety of conditions benefit from preoperative sampling. These include fine needle aspirates (FNA) of joints, abdomen, pulmonary spaces, masses, cysts, and abscesses for cytologic exam. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative imaging - radiographs, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast studies, and ultrasound - aid in diagnosis, surgical planning, and evaluation. Individual and combined modalities provide the surgeon and veterinary technician with specific information.

AB  - Abstract:? Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) is a psychoactive amphetamine derivative widely used for recreational purposes. Deaths caused by acute drug intoxication with MDMA are rare but can often involve a severe hyperthermic episode. The factors underlying the increased risk of some ecstasy users to a fatal drug reaction are not known. We present a case report of a 24-year-old woman who developed fatal hyperthermia with multi-organ complications following MDMA use and was found at autopsy to have diffuse thyroid hyperplasia (Graves? disease). An antemortem blood MDMA concentration of 0.68?mg/L was measured in a sample obtained on admission to hospital. Although a cause and effect cannot be established, as the thyroid hormone is a major regulator of thermogenesis, we suggest that hyperthyroidism predisposed the subject to ecstasy-induced hyperthermia and that a pre-existing defect affecting temperature status could be one factor in explaining some ecstasy intoxication deaths.

AB  - Summary There are many, and an assortment of, environmental injuries that cats and dogs may incur. Analgesic requirements must be based on the patient at hand, the level of consciousness, core temperature, associated injuries and pain behaviours exhibited. Opioids are the analgesic of choice and must be titrated to affect to avoid a ?relative? overdose. While pain is not associated with hyperthermia, associated injuries, either traumatic or subsequent to organ involvement, will cause pain. Cardiovascular support is critical since hyperthermia causes decreased cardiac output, hypotension and tachyarrhythmia. ?Near-drowning? will result in a degree of respiratory distress where intubation and oxygenation may be indicated and general anesthesia required. Pain associated with envenomation results mostly from local and systemic myolysis. While the majority of quills may be easily visualized, there is always one or more that is detected by palpation/stroking in a retrograde direction.

AB  - Abstract A class of bioactive, stimuli-responsive co-joined interpenetrating networks of inherently conductive polymers and highly hydrated hydrogels are being developed for implantable biodevice interfaces and for electric field induced release of elutable drugs. A novel microfabricated multidisc electrode array biotransducer intended for trauma management has been coated with poly(HEMA)-polypyrrole and characterized by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry using ferrocene monocarboxylic acid (FcCOOH) as a probe molecule. Electrodeposition of polypyrrole (700?mV vs. Ag/AgCl) to 100 mC/cm2 onto the hydrogel coated microdisc electrode array resulted in large and unstable background currents relative to uncoated electrodes. Overoxidation of polypyrrole (0?1.2?V vs. Ag/AgCl, 20 cylces, 100?mV/s) eliminates background current. Dose-response curves with FcCOOH showed that the transducer has good reproducibility with molecules of facile electrochemical properties. Polypyrrole provides interference screening of endogenous interferents in biosensor applications with a 12:1 rejection ratio. GOx was immobilized via electropolymerization of polypyrrole into hydrogel coated MDEA 5037s to yield biotransducers with sensitivity of 0.045?µA?mM?1 cm?2. Changes to improve biotransducer sensitivity are proposed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To determine the prevalence of nine canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) pathogens in asymptomatic dogs presented at animal shelters across the United States. METHODS Ocular and oronasal swabs from asymptomatic dogs (n = 503) were tested using qPCR assay for Bordetella bronchiseptica, canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine herpesvirus type 1 (CHV), canine influenza virus (CIV), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), Mycoplasma cynos and Streptococcus equi subsp zooepidemicus. RESULTS A total of 240 (47 · 7%) asymptomatic dogs were PCR-positive for at least one CIRD pathogen. Prevalence of two-, three-, four-, and five-pathogen cases was 12 · 7, 3 · 8, 1 · 8, and 0 · 4%, respectively. Mycoplasma cynos (29 · 2%), B. bronchiseptica (19 · 5%), CAV-2 (12 · 5%), CDV (7 · 4%) and CPIV (3 · 2%) were the most commonly detected pathogens. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The prevalence of traditional and newly emerging pathogens associated with CIRD is poorly defined in clinically healthy dogs. This study determined that a high percentage of asymptomatic shelter dogs harbor CIRD pathogens, including the newly emerging pathogen M. cynos and the historically prevalent pathogen B. bronchiseptica.

AB  - Background Reye's syndrome (RS) is a rare but severe acute life-threating disease characterized by encephalopathy and fatty liver damage. Reye's syndrome is most common in children and rarely occurs in adults. Case presentation A 56-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with disturbance of consciousness and respiratory failure. She had taken ibuprofen for headache. Her Glasgow Coma Scale score was E3V3M5 on admission. The laboratory findings revealed acute liver failure with prothrombin time ? international normalized ratio of 3.16, aspartate aminotransferase 12,548 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 5,725 IU/L, and blood ammonia 102 ?g/dL. Head magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintense signals on diffusion-weighed images of globus pallidus. We diagnosed the patient with RS induced by influenza A and use of ibuprofen. The patient received supportive care in the intensive care unit and her clinical outcome was favorable. Conclusion Ibuprofen might be a risk factor for RS.

AB  - This chapter details instruction on the basics of effective bovine female urinogenital surgery, including proper instrumentation, asepsis, effective anaesthesia and essential techniques. This surgery includes techiques for the following: caesarean section; vaginal and cervical prolapse; uterine prolapse; perineal laceration; episiotomy; ovariectomy; and bladder eversion. Historically, hydroallantois and hydroamnion were further indications for a two-stage caesarean section (day one: slow drainage of uterine fluids; day two: caesarean section). Such cases have a better prognosis if early calving is induced before a full-term pregnancy with corticosteroids and prostaglandins, possibly followed several days later by an i.v. oxytocin drip in non-responsive cases. Vaginal and cervical prolapse is typically seen in late gestation or the early post-partum period in fat beef and dairy breeds. Salvage after parturition is the best solution, as it will recur in the succeeding gestation.

AB  - Abstract. Objectives: Resuscitation studies of hypertonic saline using controlled and uncontrolled hemorrhage models yield conflicting results with regard to efficacy. These disparate results reflect the use of models and resuscitation regimens that are not comparable between studies. This study evaluated the effects of comparable and clinically relevant resuscitation regimens of 7.5% sodium chloride/6% dextran 70 (HSD) and 0.9% sodium chloride (NS) in a near-fatal uncontrolled hemorrhage model. Methods: Thirty-six swine (14.2 to 21.4 kg) with 4-mm aortic tears were bled to a pulse pressure of 5 mm Hg (40-45 mL/kg). The animals were resuscitated with either NS or HSD administered in volumes that provided equivalent sodium loads at similar rates. Group II (n = 12) was resuscitated with 80 mL/kg of NS at a rate of 4 mL/kg/min. Group III (n = 12) received 9.6 mL/kg of HSD at a rate of 0.48 mL/kg/min. In both groups, crystalloid resuscitation was followed by shed blood infusion (30 mL/kg) at a rate of 2 mL/kg/min. Group I (controls; n = 12) were not resuscitated. Results: One-hour mortality was significantly greater in group I (92%) as compared with group II (33%) and group III (33%) (Fisher's exact test; p = 0.004). Intraperitoneal hemorrhage was significantly greater in group II (34 ± 20 mL/kg) and group III (31 ± 13 mL/kg) as compared with group I (5 ± 2 mL/kg) (ANOVA; p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in hemodynamic parameters between groups II and III. Conclusion: In this model of severe uncontrolled hemorrhage, resuscitation with HSD or NS, administered in volumes that provided equivalent sodium loads at similar rates, had similar effects on mortality, hemodynamic parameters, and hemorrhage from the injury site.
