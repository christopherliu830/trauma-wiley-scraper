AB  - Summary In the United Kingdom, when a patient complains that he/she has impaired vision, the first port of call is frequently an optometrist and if spectacles are not the answer a further referral is made to a hospital through the general practitioner. Unilateral visual field defects that present in this way are commonly caused by focal retinal pathology, congenital optic nerve defects, glaucoma, optic disc drusen, previous trauma, compressive lesions and as chronic sequelae of subclinical branch retinal artery and vein occlusions or demyelinating optic neuritis. The diagnostic problem of progressive bilateral visual loss is usually solvable with a clear understanding of the knowledge of the visual pathways, patterns of visual symptoms and careful examination. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) permits non-cross-sectional imaging of internal structures in biological tissues using near infra-red light. Optic nerve lesions generally lead to monocular visual loss and pain is a frequent accompanying features.

AB  - Alcohol abuse causes impairment of cognitive function ranging from mild forms to end-stage dementia. Alcohol-related dementia accounts for nearly 20% of all admissions to state mental hospitals and may result from head trauma, thiamine deficiency, Alzheimer's, and other brain diseases that can be diagnosed conclusively only at autopsy. However, we postulate that after all these conditions have been excluded, an ?alcohol encephalopathy? remains. This is characterized by impaired synaptic function, which underlies the continuum of impaired intellectual function. We found in 79 histologically normal brains of a nondemented general hospital population a 40% decrease in the density of cholinergic muscarinic receptors in the frontal cortex of alcoholics when compared with matched controls of the same age. Only alcohol abuse and not aging, postmortem changes, medications, clinical (including liver) diseases, or differences in causes of death could account for this loss.

AB  - Abstract Cognitive impairment as it relates to making sense of information, or to communicating information needs, can range from mild disorientation and aphasia, to a complete loss of short-term memory and use of language. While studies on semantic dementia (SD), for example, are evident in a range of health science disciplines, and social work, little research ? particularly within the information science discipline ? on categorization or classification strategies for sense-making and recall among those with SD or related cognitive impairments, has been identified. This poster reports on a pilot study exploring ?sorting? strategies for recalling everyday life experiences, and the effectiveness of multi-modal tokens as context for association and reconstruction of participant scenarios. Preliminary to a larger study, participants diagnosed with early stage Alzheimer/Dementia (AD) responded to questions concerning personal everyday life events. After a delay of several weeks, they were asked to describe what they associated with representative non-verbal tokens or cues. Recollections were compared with original scenarios to determine (1) whether and how the multi-modal cues provided access to the initial recall of the everyday life event, (2) what additional scenarios, if any, were evoked, and (3) what associative links revealed, subsequently, about sense-making and sorting strategies around memory recall. Understanding how these strategies assist with reconstructing episodic and semantic memories could inform the design of life history retrieval systems for reinforcing or recovering intact memory.

AB  - Summary The quality of donor organs will determine the quality of life for the recipient and the importance of optimal management of the multi-organ donor is that the organs may benefit up to five, critically ill, patients. The basic principle is to maintain sufficient preload to minimise the need for inotropic support and it is recommended that all multiple organ donors should have central venous and arterial pressure monitoring in addition to adequate venous access. The importance of the choice of fluid for volume expansion and the management of the hormonal disturbances which follow brain death are considered.

AB  - Abstract Background Peeling procedures in retinal surgery require micron-scale manipulation and control of sub-tactile forces. Methods Hybrid position/force control of an actuated handheld microsurgical instrument is presented as a means for simultaneously improving positioning accuracy and reducing forces to prevent avoidable trauma to tissue. The system response was evaluated, and membrane-peeling trials were performed by four test subjects in both artificial and animal models. Results Maximum force was reduced by 56% in both models compared with position control. No statistically significant effect on procedure duration was observed. Conclusions A hybrid position/force control system has been implemented that successfully attenuates forces and minimizes unwanted excursions during microsurgical procedures such as membrane peeling. Results also suggest that improvements in safety using this technique may be attained without increasing the duration of the procedure. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Splenic ectopic pregnancy refers to the implantation of the oosperm in the spleen. If not diagnosed early, the results of this phenomenon would almost certainly be splenic rupture, which is equivalent to the spontaneous rupture of the spleen. If the patient has no history of trauma, it is difficult to diagnose this condition early and an explicit diagnosis is often obtained by exploratory laparotomy. We report the case of a 27-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital due to abdominal pain and hemorrhagic shock. Under emergency general anesthesia, gynecologist and hepatobiliary surgeons worked together to conduct an exploratory laparotomy. It was confirmed during surgery that this was ectopic pregnancy in the spleen, which caused rupture of the spleen. Hence, splenectomy was conducted. Postoperative recovery was good.

AB  - Key points Absence epilepsy is characterized by the occurrence of spike-and-wave discharges concomitant with an alteration of consciousness and is associated with cognitive comorbidities. In a genetic model of absence epilepsy in the rat, the genetic absence epilepsy rat from Strasbourg (GAERS), spike-and-wave discharges are shown to be initiated in the barrel field primary somatosensory cortex that codes whisker-related information, therefore playing an essential role in the interactions of rodents with their environment. Sensory-information processing is impaired in the epileptic barrel field primary somatosensory cortex of GAERS, with a delayed sensory-evoked potential and a duplicated neuronal response to whisker stimulation in in vivo extracellular recordings. Yet, GAERS present no defaults of performance in a texture discrimination task, suggesting the existence of a compensatory mechanism within the epileptic neuronal network. The results of the present study indicate that physiological primary functions are processed differently in an epileptic cortical network. Abstract Several neurodevelopmental pathologies are associated with disorganized cortical circuits that may alter primary functions such as sensory processes. In the present study, we investigated whether the function of a cortical area is altered in the seizure onset zone of absence epilepsy, a prototypical form of childhood genetic epilepsy associated with cognitive impairments. We first combined in vivo multichannel electrophysiological recordings and histology to precisely localize the seizure onset zone in the genetic absence epilepsy rat from Strasbourg (GAERS). We then investigated the functionality of this epileptic zone using extracellular silicon probe recordings of sensory-evoked local field potentials and multi-unit activity, as well as a behavioural test of texture discrimination. We show that seizures in this model are initiated in the barrel field part of the primary somatosensory cortex and are associated with high-frequency oscillations. In this cortex, we found an increased density of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in layer 5 in GAERS compared to non-epileptic Wistar rats. Its functional investigation revealed that sensory abilities of GAERS are not affected in a texture-discrimination task, whereas the intracortical processing of sensory-evoked information is delayed and duplicated. Altogether, these results suggest that absence seizures are associated with an increase of parvalbumin-inhibitory neurons, which may promote the functional relationship between epileptic oscillations and high-frequency activities. Our findings suggest that cortical circuits operate differently in the epileptic onset zone and may adapt to maintain their ability to process highly specialized information.

AB  - Abstract Objective To provide a current review of the clinical characteristics, predictors and outcomes in critically ill patients presenting to the ED with acute pancreatitis and subsequently admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary referral centre in Australia. Methods A retrospective single-centre study of adult patients admitted with pancreatitis. Severe acute pancreatitis defined by Bedside Index of Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) score ≥2. Results Eighty-seven patients fulfilled criteria for inclusion during the study period, representing 0.9% of all ICU admissions. The median age of patients was 54. Survival was independent of patients? age, sex, aetiology and comorbidities. Mortality was 30.8% for both inpatient referrals to the ICU and for direct referrals via the ED. Higher mortality was identified among patients requiring mechanical ventilation (74.2 vs 24.6% in survivors; P?<?0.0001), vasopressor support (85.7 vs 33.8% in survivors; P?<?0.0001) or renal replacement therapy (60 vs 16.9% in survivors; P?<?0.002). BISAP score surpasses Ranson's and Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Examination (APACHE) II scores in discriminating between survivors and non-survivors among unselected patients with acute pancreatitis admitted to ICU, whereas APACHE II discriminates better in the cohort admitted from ED. Conclusion Severe acute pancreatitis is associated with high mortality. Aetiology and comorbidity did not predict adverse outcomes in this population. BISAP score is non-inferior to APACHE II score as a prognostic tool in critically ill patients with acute pancreatitis and could be used to triage admission. Evidence of persistent organ dysfunction and requirements for organ support reliably identify patients at high-risk of death.

AB  - Objectives: Immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) is a severe disease for which evidence is lacking to make informed choices regarding immunosuppressive regimen. The aims of the current study were to determine the effect of different treatment regimens on outcome in affected animals and to identify parameters that may be used as prognostic factors for the disease. Methods: The records of dogs presenting to a veterinary hospital in the period 2002 to 2010 for treatment of IMHA were examined and follow-up data were obtained. Statistical tests were performed to establish whether treatment regimen affected outcome and to identify prognostic factors for outcome. Results: Treatment regimen had a significant effect on the outcome (measured as survival of hospitalisation) but there were insufficient subjects to determine the cause of the difference. Serum bilirubin and urea concentrations were found to be significant negative prognostic factors for the outcome of IMHA cases and the concentrations of these parameters were significantly different between animals that survived or died while hospitalised. Clinical Significance: This study presents the first report of a significant difference in outcome comparing animals treated with immunosuppressive drugs which are in widespread clinical usage. Although possible confounding factors should be considered, these findings could have major consequences for the treatment of IMHA.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the principles and physics of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and its current use in human and veterinary medicine. Data sources: Research for this manuscript included current human and veterinary literature. Human-based studies: Human studies of BIA and multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (MFBIA) have resulted in a considerable amount of controversy about the capability of BIA and MFBIA to accurately assess exact fluid volume and distribution. The recent emphasis on point-of-care monitoring has resulted in the use of BIA and MFBIA to evaluate the rapid changes in fluid distribution that can occur with trauma and various disease states. Veterinary-based studies: The use of BIA and MFBIA has been limited in veterinary medicine. However, studies in domestic and laboratory animals have shown good correlation with the isotope dilution method. The effectiveness of BIA/MFBIA in monitoring the critically ill veterinary patient has not yet been evaluated. Conclusion: BIA and MFBIA have been used to evaluate a variety of biological parameters such as nutritional status, cardiac output, and intracellular and extracellular fluid volumes. Recent studies using BIA and MFBIA to evaluate fluid compartmentalization and shifts in critically ill human patients have shown promising results. BIA and MFBIA provide immediate results that may aid in the assessment of a patient's clinical progress and response to therapy.

AB  - Objective To compare tensile strength, failure location, and histologic features after acute repeat celiotomy through a ventral median (RVM) or a right ventral paramedian (RVP) celiotomy in horses. Study Design Ex vivo experimental study. Animals Adult horses (N?=?18). Methods Twelve adult horses had original ventral median (OVM) celiotomy. Repeat celiotomy was performed 72?hours postoperatively through the original ventral median (RVM, N?=?6) or a RVP (N?=?6) celiotomy. Celiotomies were scored daily for edema, drainage, and dehiscence. Fourteen days after repeat celiotomy, horses were euthanatized and abdominal wall containing celiotomy(ies) were collected for biomechanical and histological evaluation. The abdominal wall of control horses (N?=?6; no celiotomy) was collected for biomechanical testing. Vital sign variables, incisional edema, and histologic scores were compared using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Incisional fibrotic depth and tensile strength per unit length (N/cm) was compared using repeated measures ANOVA. Results RVM and RVP horses had significantly less tensile strength compared to control horses, but no differences were observed between RVM and RVP horses. No differences in healing, inflammation, infection, or necrosis of repeat celiotomies was observed, but RVP horses accumulated more fibrin and hemorrhage within the incision. RVP horses had significantly greater incisional edema scores, but incisional drainage was more frequent in RVM horses. Conclusions Acute repeat celiotomy through a RVM incision results in similar incisional healing and tensile strength compared with repeat celiotomy through a RVP incision.

AB  - In 32 patients subjected to total hip replacement, postoperative pain relief was achieved by random treatment with either 5 mg of morphine in 10 ml of saline (n = 15) or 6?8 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine (n = 17), both drugs administered by the lumbar epidural route. In an additional group of 10 patients, post-traumatic thoracic or post-operative abdominal pain was relieved first by 4?6 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine and subsequently by 5 mg of morphine in 10 ml of saline, both drugs being administered by the thoracic epidural route. The duration of analgesia was significantly longer, on average, with morphine (28 h) than with bupivacaine (4.3 h) when the drugs were given by the lumbar route. Thoracic administration of morphine also resulted in a significantly longer duration of pain relief (on average 9.8 h) than that of bupivacaine (3.8 h). Morphine gave satisfactory pain relief in all cases. It was not associated with motor block, loss of sensitivity to temperature, touch, or pin-prick, or any signs of sympathetic block, as was the case with epidural bupivacaine. Plasma concentrations of morphine were not detectable 8 h after injection, though the patients still had pain relief. One case of delayed severe respiratory depression occurred 6 h after morphine injection via the thoracic route. Epidural morphine analgesia should therefore be reserved for patients in whom continual surveillance is possible, at least until more is known about the pharmacokinetics of narcotics in the epidural and subarachnoid space.

AB  - abstract? This edited interview explores the clinical applications of recent critiques of oedipal theories of ?femininity?. We discuss new thinking about language, sexuality and how we symbolize gender through our bodies, illustrating the influence of neuro-psychoanalysis (Solms  Grosz 1994). Radical challenges to the use of ?binary? categories, including masculinity/femininity, are considered, and we note that dispensing with such terminology impedes discussion of gender inequality. We explore intersubjective (Benjamin 2000) and philosophical (Butler 2000) perspectives on gender as the site for enactments of trauma (Harris 2000), along with the role of unmourned loss in the creation of heterosexual femininity. Clinical examples are counterposed: contemporary theory on male ?femininity? and hysteria, with recent thinking about female ?masculinity?. We conclude that we may be reaching an impasse ? the end of a golden age of theorizing about sexual identity ? because of the current limitations and contradictions of psychoanalytic language and theory.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the prevalence of canine chronic pancreatitis in first-opinion practice and identify breed associations or other risk factors. Methods: Three sections of pancreas were taken from 200 unselected canine post-mortem examinations from first-opinion practices. Sections were graded for inflammation, fibrosis and other lesions. Prevalence and relative risks of chronic pancreatitis and other pancreatic diseases were calculated. Results: The prevalence of chronic pancreatitis was 34 per cent omitting the autolysed cases. Cavalier King Charles spaniels, collies and boxers had increased relative risks of chronic pancreatitis; cocker spaniels had an increased relative risks of acute and chronic pancreatitis combined. Fifty-seven per cent of cases of chronic pancreatitis were classified histologically as moderate or marked. Forty-one per cent of cases involved all three sections. Dogs with chronic pancreatitis were more commonly female and overweight, but neither factor increased the relative risk of chronic pancreatitis. There were breed differences in histological appearances and 24·5 per cent of cases were too autolysed to interpret with an increased relative risk of autolysis in a number of large breeds. Clinical Significance: Chronic pancreatitis is a common, under-estimated disease in the first-opinion dog population with distinctive breed risks and histological appearances.

After examining film-radiography and conventional fluoroscopy, in which images arise from differential attenuation of an X-ray beam by various tissues, it moves on to their twenty-first century computer-based descendants: computed radiography (CR), digital radiography (DR), digital subtraction angiography (DSA), culminating in three-dimensional mapping of tissues with spiral, multi-slice CT. It then addresses nuclear medicine (NM), including single photon emission CT (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), where contrast comes from the differential uptake of a radiopharmaceutical by tissues. With diagnostic ultrasound (US), echoes are created at tissue interfaces where differences in tissue elasticity and density occur. The chapter concludes with an appendix on the selection of optimal imaging modalities for representative clinical problems.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to review the history, clinical course, treatment, and outcome of movement disorders in children and young people with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Case notes were reviewed retrospectively of children and young people who presented with movement disorders in CRPS to our tertiary paediatric pain service over a period of 13 years. Ten children with CRPS presented with movement disorders (eight females, two males). The age at first presentation with symptoms of CRPS ranged from 8 to 15 years (mean 11y 2mo, median 13y). The most common movement disorder was dystonia (n=8), followed by tremors (n=3) and myoclonus (n=3); two patients had all three movement disorders. The movement disorder affected mainly the lower limb (n=9) with a predilection for the foot (n=7) and was frequently initiated by minor trauma (n=7). Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 14 years. The outcome was variable, with good prognosis in nearly half of the cases: four children experienced complete resolution of symptoms. Two children showed a slight improvement. Four children showed no improvement. Movement disorders in CRPS are under-recognized in children. The management has to be multidisciplinary with an expertize in paediatric pain.

AB  - Open heart surgery was performed during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to surgically correct subvalvular aortic stenosis in seven dogs. After initiation of total CPB, cardiac arrest was induced by antegrade and retrograde administration of blood cardioplegia. The subvalvular fibrous stenosis was resected through a transverse aortotomy. Intraoperatively and postop-eratively, dobutamine, nitroprusside, lidocaine, blood(-products), and crystalloid solutions were used to manage hypotension and optimize cardiac index. Aortic cross-clamp time varied from 73 to 166 minutes, and duration of CPB varied from 130 to 210 minutes, latrogenic incision into the mitral valve in two dogs was the most significant introperative complication. Postoperative complications included: hypoproteinemia (n = 7), premature ventricular depolarization (n = 6), increased systemic vascular resistance index (n = 5), increased O2 extraction (n = 3), pulmonary edema (n = 2), and decreased cardiac index (n = 1). All seven dogs were discharged alive and in stable condition. Six dogs are alive and in stable condition after a mean follow up of 15.8 months. This is the first detailed report of CPB in a series of clinical veterinary patients. Using the techniques described in this paper, open heart surgery of considerable duration can be performed successfully in dogs with significant myocardial hypertrophy and endomyocardial fibrosis secondary to subvalvular aortic stenosis.
