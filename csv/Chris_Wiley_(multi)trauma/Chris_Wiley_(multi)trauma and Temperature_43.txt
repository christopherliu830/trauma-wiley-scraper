AB  - Objective To describe a surgical technique for, and outcome after, laparoscopic vasectomy of free-ranging elephants. Study Design Case series. Animals African elephants (Loxodonta africana; n?=?14). Methods Male elephants (12?35 years old) were anesthetized with etorphine and supported in a sling in a modified standing position, and positive pressure ventilated with oxygen. Anesthesia was maintained with IV etorphine. Vasectomy was performed under field conditions by bilateral, open-approach, flank laparoscopy with the abdomen insufflated with filtered ambient air. A 4-cm segment of each ductus deferens was excised. Behavior and incision healing were recorded for 8 months postoperatively. Results Successful bilateral vasectomy (surgical time, 57?125?minutes) was confirmed by histologic examination of excised tissue. Recovery was uneventful without signs of abnormal behavior. Large intestine lacerations (3 elephants; 1 full and 2 partial thickness) were sutured extracorporeally. One elephant found dead at 6 weeks, had no prior abnormal signs. Skin incisions healed without complication. Conclusions Laparoscopic vasectomy can be performed in African elephants in their natural environment.

AB  - Open heart surgery was performed during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to surgically correct subvalvular aortic stenosis in seven dogs. After initiation of total CPB, cardiac arrest was induced by antegrade and retrograde administration of blood cardioplegia. The subvalvular fibrous stenosis was resected through a transverse aortotomy. Intraoperatively and postop-eratively, dobutamine, nitroprusside, lidocaine, blood(-products), and crystalloid solutions were used to manage hypotension and optimize cardiac index. Aortic cross-clamp time varied from 73 to 166 minutes, and duration of CPB varied from 130 to 210 minutes, latrogenic incision into the mitral valve in two dogs was the most significant introperative complication. Postoperative complications included: hypoproteinemia (n = 7), premature ventricular depolarization (n = 6), increased systemic vascular resistance index (n = 5), increased O2 extraction (n = 3), pulmonary edema (n = 2), and decreased cardiac index (n = 1). All seven dogs were discharged alive and in stable condition. Six dogs are alive and in stable condition after a mean follow up of 15.8 months. This is the first detailed report of CPB in a series of clinical veterinary patients. Using the techniques described in this paper, open heart surgery of considerable duration can be performed successfully in dogs with significant myocardial hypertrophy and endomyocardial fibrosis secondary to subvalvular aortic stenosis.

AB  - Summary Injuries to the head are common and can result in a significant loss of function if a vital structure is involved. The head is highly prominent, so cosmetic repair of a wound to the head is often important esthetically and may help retain the horse's resale value. Injuries to the head generally heal well, but the repair of such injuries requires skilled treatment to obtain optimal results. Meticulous attention to repair is necessary when repairing a laceration of a lip, eyelid, or nostril because proper function of these highly mobile structures is important. Although injuries to ears are not common, restoring the cosmetic appearance and function of an injured ear is challenging. Facial and orbital fractures are usually depressed, creating a conspicuous deformity, but they generally can be reconstructed successfully. Nasocutaneous and sinocutaneous fistulas have significant functional and cosmetic implications and can be very challenging to repair, especially if large.

AB  - Summary Sketches provides, in more technical language, outlines of the various imaging modalities, and illustrates their roles in medical care with many clinical examples. After examining film-radiography and conventional fluoroscopy, in which images arise from differential attenuation of an X-ray beam by various tissues, it moves on to their twenty-first century computer-based descendants: computed radiography (CR), digital radiography (DR), digital subtraction angiography (DSA), culminating in three-dimensional mapping of tissues with spiral, multi-slice CT. It then addresses nuclear medicine (NM), including single photon emission CT (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), where contrast comes from the differential uptake of a radiopharmaceutical by tissues. With diagnostic ultrasound (US), echoes are created at tissue interfaces where differences in tissue elasticity and density occur. The chapter concludes with an appendix on the selection of optimal imaging modalities for representative clinical problems.

AB  - Summary Diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for most other geriatric emergencies. Deranged glycaemic control may be the first indication of an infection or other acute illness. The risk of severe hypoglycaemia increases with age, and symptoms may be atypical. Long-acting insulin or oral sulphonylureas can cause persistent hypoglycaemia. Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar syndrome is associated with potentially lethal dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. Complications include infection and thrombosis. Older patients are prone to disorders of thermoregulation due to extreme environmental conditions, medical conditions or medication. Hypothermia can be classified into mild, moderate and severe. Heat illness is less common in temperate climates but older patients are particularly vulnerable during heatwaves and as a result of sun-exposure. In this chapter: A practical guide to treating hypoglycaemia in the older patient: glucagon, sandwich or IV dextrose? Strategies for re-warming in hypothermia Steps to managing heat-related illness

AB  - In civilian trauma concerns about tourniquet-related problems has rendered tourniquets virtually obselete. The use of tourniquets in a battlefield setting however remains surrounded by controversy. Whilst many accept that if properly used, tourniquets can be life saving devices, opinion is divided regarding its role. Some surgeons have recommended abolition of the tourniquet, whist others advocate that every combat solder should be issued with a tourniquet as part of their personal equipment. The recent introduction of the self applied C-A-T tourniquet into the Australian Defence Force has re-ignited controversy as to the appropriate role of tourniquets in an operational setting. During Vietnam, Desert Storm and Somalia haemorrhage from extremity wounds was a leading cause of preventable combat deaths. Improvements in body armour and increased exposure to blast injury has resulted in a relative increase in limb injuries in recent operations. Experience in Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan particularly by Special Operations communities has led to a re-assessment of the efficacy of battlefield tourniquet systems. The C-A-T tourniquet has been widely used in Iraq and Afghanistan. No iatrogenic injury has been reported, even with tourniquet times up to 8 hours. This paper will discuss the history of tourniquet use in the military from its first introduction in 1674 to the most recent ADF doctrine (ADFP XXX). It will also present trial results from the UK and US and recommendations from the 2006 Advanced Technologies Applied to Combat Casualty Care Conference (ATACC). This paper will address the basis of current doctrine and provide a case for and against the use of tourniquets in an operational setting.

AB  - A simple technique for autotransfusion has been developed and used in the successful resuscitation of dogs suffering severe trauma and /or hemorrhage. The purpose of this abstract is three-fold: 1) Describe the criteria used in case selection; 2) Describe the method used; and 3) Describe the results of its use in a limited number of cases. Case Selection: The criteria used were the following: 1. Ongoing significant hemorrhage or severe hemorrhage noted in a body cavity where the blood could be collected; 2. Acute hemorrhage amounts deemed to be life-threatening (>40% calculated blood volume [88?ml/kg]); 3. Where other choices (fresh or stored homologus blood, Oxyglobin) in amounts needed were not possible. Method: Blood was aspirated into a suction canister using a Pool or Yankauer suction tip, with the tip placed under the pool (s) of blood to eliminate as many bubbles in the collection process as possible. If the canister was not sterilized it was scrubbed with a surgical prep solution and then rinsed with tap water prior to blood collection. The blood in the canister was poured into a wide opening in a hanging empty plastic intravenous fluid bag with a blood administration set inserted. The blood was intravenously administered by gravity drip as needed. No attempt was made to use any anticoagulant. Amounts of blood given, clinical responses, and complications were recorded. Results: The procedure was used in 12 dogs: 5 abdominal hemorrhage, 3 thoracic hemorrhage, 2 hemorrhage from both abdomen and chest, 2 vertebral vein hemorrhage. All blood administered was given during the operation or within 2 hours. Amounts transfused ranged from 30 to 120?ml/kg (body weight [mean 48?ml/kg]). No animals died acutely from signs thought to be associated with the transfusion of this blood. Those cases surviving to discharge were 4 abdominal, 2 thoracic, 1 combined, and 1 vertebral vein. There were no infections attributed to the autotransfusion. It is concluded that this technique can be recommended and may be considered life-saving in selected cases.

AB  - Background: How tissue patterns form in development and regeneration is a fundamental issue remaining to be fully understood. The integument often forms repetitive units in space (periodic patterning) and time (cyclic renewal), such as feathers and hairs. Integument patterns are visible and experimentally manipulatable, helping us reveal pattern formative processes. Variability is seen in regional phenotypic specificities and temporal cycling at different physiological stages. Results: Here we show some cellular/molecular bases revealed by analyzing integument patterns. (1) Localized cellular activity (proliferation, rearrangement, apoptosis, differentiation) transforms prototypic organ primordia into specific shapes. Combinatorial positioning of different localized activity zones generates diverse and complex organ forms. (2) Competitive equilibrium between activators and inhibitors regulates stem cells through cyclic quiescence and activation. Conclusions: Dynamic interactions between stem cells and their adjacent niche regulate regenerative behavior, modulated by multi-layers of macro-environmental factors (dermis, body hormone status, and external environment). Genomics studies may reveal how positional information of localized cellular activity is stored. In vivo skin imaging and lineage tracing unveils new insights into stem cell plasticity. Principles of self-assembly obtained from the integumentary organ model can be applied to help restore damaged patterns during regenerative wound healing and for tissue engineering to rebuild tissues.

AB  - Summary Many of the topical products noted can be considered ?natural?, such as chitosan, collagen, and alginates. This chapter focuses on a few of the basic natural products used in wound care, including, honey, sugar, yeast extract, and aloe vera. Large areas of necrotic tissue are best surgically debrided prior to application of honey and sugar. Leeches have been used in an attempt to manage hemodynamic imbalance or venous insufficiency in compromised skin. In an attempt to reduce venous stasis, leeches were applied to the tail wound daily over a 4-day period. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been described for medical uses. The medical uses include orthopedics, sports medicine, dentistry, otolaryngology, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, urogenital surgery, burns and wound healing, cardiothoracic surgery, and maxillofacial surgery. The primary clinical application of PRP is to promote wound healing by increasing the local concentration of growth factors involved in the migration, proliferation, and maturation at the site of injury.

This condition was associated with anaemia and elevation of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Abnormal radiological findings included hepatomegaly, gas-filled intestinal loops consistent with gastrointestinal ileus and ascites. Ultrasonographic findings included heterogeneous liver parenchyma, free abdominal fluid and reduced bowel motility. Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of the liver in all three cases.

AB  - Abstract These guidelines are a consensus work of a considerable number of members of the immunology and flow cytometry community. They provide the theory and key practical aspects of flow cytometry enabling immunologists to avoid the common errors that often undermine immunological data. Notably, there are comprehensive sections of all major immune cell types with helpful Tables detailing phenotypes in murine and human cells. The latest flow cytometry techniques and applications are also described, featuring examples of the data that can be generated and, importantly, how the data can be analysed. Furthermore, there are sections detailing tips, tricks and pitfalls to avoid, all written and peer-reviewed by leading experts in the field, making this an essential research companion.

AB  - Abstract Bleeding complications arising from trauma, surgery, and as congenital, disease-associated, or drug-induced blood disorders can cause significant morbidities and mortalities in civilian and military populations. Therefore, stoppage of bleeding (hemostasis) is of paramount clinical significance in prophylactic, surgical, and emergency scenarios. For externally accessible injuries, a variety of natural and synthetic biomaterials have undergone robust research, leading to hemostatic technologies including glues, bandages, tamponades, tourniquets, dressings, and procoagulant powders. In contrast, treatment of internal noncompressible hemorrhage still heavily depends on transfusion of whole blood or blood's hemostatic components (platelets, fibrinogen, and coagulation factors). Transfusion of platelets poses significant challenges of limited availability, high cost, contamination risks, short shelf-life, low portability, performance variability, and immunological side effects, while use of fibrinogen or coagulation factors provides only partial mechanisms for hemostasis. With such considerations, significant interdisciplinary research endeavors have been focused on developing materials and technologies that can be manufactured conveniently, sterilized to minimize contamination and enhance shelf-life, and administered intravenously to mimic, leverage, and amplify physiological hemostatic mechanisms. Here, a comprehensive review regarding the various topical, intracavitary, and intravenous hemostatic technologies in terms of materials, mechanisms, and state-of-art is provided, and challenges and opportunities to help advancement of the field are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Background? Most reported sporotrichosis cases came from South American countries, the USA, India and Japan. This mycosis is also endemic in Northeast China. However, the situation is not clear for international researchers due to lack of large series reported in English. Objectives? To report and analyse 457 sporotrichosis cases. Methods? Retrospective study of 457 cases of sporotrichosis diagnosed by fungal culture at the First Hospital of Jilin University from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2009. Results? In this series, the male: female ratio was 1:1.42. Mean age was 41.2?years. Cases from age group 51?60?years accounted for most of the cases (22.54%). A total of 434 patients lived in rural areas (94.97%). The onset of symptoms in 67.61% cases happened in cold seasons (winter and spring). History of trauma presented in 133 cases (29.1%). The mean duration of the symptoms before the presentation was 6.41?months. A total of 190 (41.58%) showed lymphocutaneous form, 252 patients (55.14%) showed fixed form, 8 patients (1.75%) showed disseminated cutaneous sporotrichosis and the clinical form of 7 patients (1.53%) could not be defined. Extremities and nodules were the most frequently involved sites and founded manifestation. Main histopathology findings were suppurative granuloma, tuberculoid granuloma and mixed inflammatory granuloma. A total of 75 cases (19.74%) had fungal elements revealed by Periodic Acid-Schiff staining. Patients responded well to potassium iodide (KI), itraconazole, terbinafine and combinations of these agents with a mean course of 2.17?months to resolve. Conclusion? As the first report of a large series of sporotrichosis cases from China to be published in English literature, our study indicated a serious sporotrichosis endemic situation in Jilin province, Northeast China, with epidemiological and clinical characteristics similar to those of previous Chinese reports, but different from those in other countries. KI, itraconazole and terbinafine are effective for the treatment.

AB  - Abstract Multifunctional nanomaterials for cancer therapy has attracted researchers? attention for decades. In this study, a unique oxidative method using KMnO4 or K2MnO4 as oxidizing agents to oxidize dopamine (DA) to polydopamine (PDA) was reported. The oxidizing agent was reduced to MnOx to form MnOx/PDA composite NPs. Afterwards, the MnOx/PDA composite NPs were surface-modified with bovine serum albumin (BSA) to form a multifunctional theranostic agent, named MnOx/PDA@BSA NPs, with improved colloidal stability and biocompatibility. Such a material would become a photothermal nanoagent, since the PDA renders the composite NPs an admirable photothermal transforming ability with the photothermal conversion efficiency of 27.06%. Meanwhile, as a commonly used T1 contrast agent, manganese (Mn2+) endowed the MnOx/PDA@BSA NPs with MRI ability, rendering the as-synthesized MnOx/PDA composite NPs a capability of imaging guided multi-modal tumor therapy. Moreover, the formed MnOx/PDA@BSA NPs were used for drug loading, which was found to own the tunable drug loading and controlled drug releasing capacity. The as-prepared composite NPs were successfully used for the combined tumor chemotherapy and photothermal therapy in?vitro and in?vivo. This research provides insights into the development of conjugated polymer-based nanomaterial for various biomedical applications, especially in imaging guided cancer therapy.
