AB  - Abstract Multifunctional nanomaterials for cancer therapy has attracted researchers? attention for decades. In this study, a unique oxidative method using KMnO4 or K2MnO4 as oxidizing agents to oxidize dopamine (DA) to polydopamine (PDA) was reported. The oxidizing agent was reduced to MnOx to form MnOx/PDA composite NPs. Afterwards, the MnOx/PDA composite NPs were surface-modified with bovine serum albumin (BSA) to form a multifunctional theranostic agent, named MnOx/PDA@BSA NPs, with improved colloidal stability and biocompatibility. Such a material would become a photothermal nanoagent, since the PDA renders the composite NPs an admirable photothermal transforming ability with the photothermal conversion efficiency of 27.06%. Meanwhile, as a commonly used T1 contrast agent, manganese (Mn2+) endowed the MnOx/PDA@BSA NPs with MRI ability, rendering the as-synthesized MnOx/PDA composite NPs a capability of imaging guided multi-modal tumor therapy. Moreover, the formed MnOx/PDA@BSA NPs were used for drug loading, which was found to own the tunable drug loading and controlled drug releasing capacity. The as-prepared composite NPs were successfully used for the combined tumor chemotherapy and photothermal therapy in?vitro and in?vivo. This research provides insights into the development of conjugated polymer-based nanomaterial for various biomedical applications, especially in imaging guided cancer therapy.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Vibrational spectroscopy is a valuable tool for the study of burned skeletal remains. Nonetheless, most investigations have been focused on a limited number of samples as well as on faunal bones rather than human bones. Conclusions based on those investigations may lack representativeness, namely about the intrabone, intra- and interskeleton variability of several chemometric indices. We aimed to investigate this issue on a large sample of human bones. Material and Methods Powder samples were collected from 168 bones from four human skeletons. The sampling targeted 47 long bones, 72 short bones, and 49 tarsal bones as well as different bone regions in a total of 638 powder samples. Bones were experimentally burned in an electric muffle furnace for two hours to maximum temperatures ranging from 400°C to 1000°C. Another 623 burned samples were then collected totaling 1261 samples subjected to FTIR-ATR analysis. The CI, BPI, C/C, and OH/P indices were calculated. Results An important intrabone, intra- and interskeleton variation was observed, especially for the BPI. The CI, C/C, and OH/P indices revealed much less variation so site-specific sampling may not be as critical in these cases. Clear differences between our results and those from previous investigations were observed, namely on the temperature increment evolution of the CI and C/C indices. Discussion The relatively large heterogeneity, especially at the intrabone level, is possibly the consequence of microstructural bone differences. The dissimilarities observed between our investigation and other published studies are probably due to the fact that the samples used here came from human rather than faunal bones. Also, our samples were buried previously to the experimental burning so this may also partly explain our contrasting results, since previous research was mostly performed on fresh bone. Future inferences based on vibrational spectroscopy analyses should take into account the possible effect of all these sources.

AB  - Subcutaneous (SC) insulin injection has been demonstrated to be the most effective method for treatment of diabetes mellitus but is conventionally performed by hypodermic needles, leading to poor management of diabetes because of the pain, needle phobia, and tissue trauma. Identification of a viable, safe, and pain-free alternative method has been a longstanding challenge in modern health care. Here, the thermoplastic droplet stretching technique is developed to create an ultrahigh-aspect-ratio needle mold with simple microstructure control. The optimized ultrafine needle (UN) with 4 mm length, minimized 120 µm outer diameter, and 15° sharp bevel angle is formed via electroplating of a metallic layer on the surface of a needle mold with forcing sharp tip. This novel UN enables minimally invasive 4 mm skin insertion to deliver insulin in the targeted SC layer. The similar relative areas under the curves of insulin concentration within UN and 31G needle in vivo insulin administration indicate that UN can ensure stable insulin absorption for secure blood glucose management. Additionally, the proposed fabrication method may facilitate industrialization and commercialization of the UN, holding great promise for replacement of hypodermic needles and for improvement of quality of life among patients with diabetes.

AB  - Abstract: The blood-contacting surface, mainly composed of polycarbonate, of the Gyro C1E3 pump was modified using plasma glow discharge to introduce a carboxyl functional group, coated with a base layer of polyethyleneimine as a linker, and coupled with heparin by multi-ionic binding to enhance blood compatibility. A relative surface content of 3.7% sulfur, which demonstrated heparin immobilization on the polycarbonate substrate, was observed on x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and a initial bioactivity of approximately 88.5 ± 7.3 mIU/cm2 was obtained by the chromogenic method for antifactor Xa assay. Furthermore, in vitro observation of platelet and fibrin adherence using bovine blood under dynamic flow conditions for 6 h revealed that the multi-ionically heparinized Gyro C1E3 had significantly stronger antithrombogenecity than the noncoated original type which was evaluated as a good hemocompatible blood pump for clinical use. Not only the Gyro C1E3 but also the ionically heparin-coated Gyro pump are expected to be thromboresistant in clinical use.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses asepsis and infection controls in surgical practice. Proper preparation of the surgical patient is a critical step in the surgical case and is related to the outcome and subsequent potential infection of the surgical site. Improper patient preparation can have catastrophic consequences for the surgical procedure and incision integrity. Surgical prep of veterinary patients consists of two steps: clipping (removal) of the hair/fur and skin cleansing with an antiseptic. Once the patient has received the initial prep, they are ready to be transported to the operating room. Proper positioning of the patient is a critical step in the patient prep process. Surgeons require the patient be positioned in a straight and anatomically correct fashion. Efficient use of specialize veterinary surgical instrumentation requires those using it to understand proper application, handling, care, and troubleshooting. Surgical grade instruments are generally made from stainless steel and other metal alloys such as carbon and chromium.

AB  - ABSTRACT Targeted bacterial delivery of anticancer proteins has the ability to overcome therapeutic resistance in tumors that limits the efficacy of chemotherapeutics. The ability of bacteria to specifically target tumors allows for delivery of aggressive proteins that directly kill cancer cells and cannot be administered systemically. However, few proteins have been tested for this purpose. To identify effective molecules, we systematically sorted proteins that have been shown to cause mammalian cell death. The genes for five proteins were selected and cloned into Escherichia coli and Salmonella. Supernatant from cultures of the transformed bacteria was applied to flasks of MCF-7 mammary carcinoma cells to identify proteins that (1) were expressed, (2) secreted, and (3) rapidly killed cancer cells. Time-lapse images were taken to visualize mammalian cell morphology. Of the investigated proteins, α-hemolysin from Staphylococcus aureus (SAH) was the most promising because it was secreted, caused trauma to cellular membranes, and induced oncosis in 18?min. After exposure for 6?h, SAH decreased cell viability by 90%. In comparison, the positive control, Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (PEA), required 11 days to achieve a similar effect, when administered at 3,000 times its LC50. The maximum death rate induced by SAH was calculated to be a reduction in cell viability of 7.1% per min, which was 200-fold faster than the PEA control. Two proteins, Dermonecrotic Toxin and Phospholipase C were active when extracted from the bacterial cytoplasm but were not secreted. This investigation revealed for the first time SAH as a potent anticancer drug for delivery by bacteria because of its ability to be secreted in a fully functional form and aggressively kill cancer cells.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2011) 119, 1052?1063. Abstract Mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs) improve functional outcome in a number of disease models through suppression of inflammation. However, their effects on neuroinflammation are unknown. In this study, we show that MSCs suppress endotoxin-induced glial activation in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs). Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated OHSCs activated MSCs to increase the expression of cyclo-oxygenase-2 and produce prostaglandin E2. MSC-derived prostaglandin E2, then suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine production by the OHSCs. Together, the results suggest the potential anti-inflammatory mechanism of MSCs in models of disease and support earlier observations that MSCs may offer a therapy for neuroinflammation produced by trauma or disease.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To investigate the safety, sedative and analgesic properties of methadone in combination with acepromazine prior to neutering in cats. Study design? Controlled clinical, block randomized, prospective, blinded study designed for regulatory purposes. Animals? 24 female and 21 male healthy cats. Methods? Cats received one of three opioids combined with acepromazine (0.05?mg?kg?1) intramuscularly (IM) for premedication: Group 1: buprenorphine (0.02?mg?kg?1), group 2: methadone (0.5?mg?kg?1), group 3 butorphanol (0.4?mg?kg?1). Sedation was assessed 30?minutes after premedication using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and simple descriptive scale. Anaesthesia was induced with alfaxalone and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. Surgical ovariohysterectomy or castration was performed. Pain was assessed using an interactive VAS (IVAS) and mechanical nociceptive threshold (MNT) with a pressure rate onset device. Methadone (0.5?mg?kg?1 IM) and meloxicam (0.2?mg?kg?1 subcutaneously) were provided 6 and 8?hours after premedication respectively, or together as rescue analgesia (IVAS above 50). Results? Sedation scores, induction agent dose, pain scores at all time points and rescue analgesia were not statistically different between groups. In methadone treated cats there was no significant variation in MNT over time, suggesting a possible anti-hyperalgesic action, whereas in the other two groups lower thresholds were recorded at various time points after surgery compared to baseline. No cats required rescue analgesia after the second dose of methadone. No perioperative adverse effects occurred. Conclusion and clinical relevance? Methadone provided comparable sedation and analgesia to both buprenorphine and butorphanol when combined with acepromazine. Differences in analgesic efficacy between opioids might have been undetectable because of the surgical model and surgeon competency. Nevertheless, methadone is an effective analgesic in cats and its administration prior to feline neutering may be advantageous.

AB  - Differential DNA methylation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis related gene FKBP5 has recently been shown to be associated with varying response to environmental influences and may play a role in how well people respond to psychological treatments. Participants (n?=?111) received exposure-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for agoraphobia with or without panic disorder, or specific phobias. Percentage DNA methylation levels were measured for the promoter region and intron 7 of FKBP5. The association between percentage reduction in clinical severity and change in DNA methylation was tested using linear mixed models. The effect of genotype (rs1360780) was tested by the inclusion of an interaction term. The association between change in DNA methylation and FKBP5 expression was examined. Change in percentage DNA methylation at one CpG site of intron 7 was associated with percentage reduction in severity (??=??4.26, p?=?3.90 ? 10?4), where a decrease in DNA methylation was associated with greater response to therapy. An interaction was detected between rs1360780 and changes in DNA methylation in the promoter region of FKBP5 on treatment outcome (p?=?.045) but did not survive correction for multiple testing. Changes in DNA methylation were not associated with FKBP5 expression. Decreasing DNA methylation at one CpG site of intron 7 of FKBP5 was strongly associated with decreasing anxiety severity following exposure-based CBT. In addition, there was suggestive evidence that allele-specific methylation at the promoter region may also be associated with treatment response. The results of this study add to the growing literature demonstrating the role of biological processes such as DNA methylation in response to environmental influences.

AB  - A nationwide survey of patients in Japan with spinocerebellar degenerations (SCD), including SDS and SND, was conducted from 1988 to 1989. The survey consisted of two parts. The first revealed that the estimated total number of patients with SCD in Japan was 5,050 (range: 4,100?6,000) with an estimated prevalence of 4.53 per 100,000 in 1987. The second part investigated the neurological and functional status of patients with SCD. The percentages of those belonging to each subtype of SCD were: OPCA; 34.4%, LCCA; 15.2%, MHCA; 12.6%, HHCA; 7.5%, SDS; 7.0%, HSP; 3.9%, DRPLA; 2.5%, FA; 2.4%, MJD; 2.0% and SND; 1.5%. Compared with European epidemiological studies Japan had a higher proportion of non-hereditary types of SCD. Various clinical features of SCD subtypes were compared grouped by pathological lesion and heredity. HHCA and LCCA: cerebellar ataxia predominated in all stages, and neurological signs other than cerebellar ataxia were rare. MHCA, DRPLA and MJD: inthe early phase ataxia was the most common symptom in MHCA, the AC form of DRPLA and MJD, but ataxia was less common and chorea or epilepsy were often observed in ME and PH forms of DRPLA. Other frequently observed clinical features were parkinsonian rigidty in MHCA, abnormal movements and posture in DRPLA and MJD, and disturbances of eye movements in MHCA, the AC form of DRPLA and MJD. OPCA, SDS and SND: dominant clinical features were cerebellar ataxia in OPCA, autonomic disturbance in SDS, and parkinsonian rigidity in SND. FA and HSP: both were rare in Japan. Clinical features related to supra-supinal lesions were frequently observed in FA. Functional status of SCD: the severity of illness was significantly associated with the level of independence in each item of ADL. Activities not requiring dynamic balance were performed independently for a longer period than those requiring dynamic balance. Among SCD subtypes, functional prognosis was poorest in non-hereditary, multi-systemic types (OPCA, SDS and SND) followed by hereditary multi-systemic types (MHCA, DRPLA and MJD), and better in spinal types (FA and HSP) and cerebellar types (HHCA and LCCA).

AB  - Background Free-tissue transfer flaps are an effective reconstructive option for complex wounds; however, flap failure is a dreaded complication requiring timely re-exploration and salvage. The aim of this study was to determine whether salvage rates were higher in skin flaps, as opposed to muscle flaps, due to the durability of the overlying skin paddle allowing for better visual post-operative monitoring and more timely recognition of the threatened flap. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent a free flap at an Australian tertiary centre between 2004 and 2014. Data were collected on patient demographics, indication, flap type, time of recognition of the threatened flap and re-exploration outcome. Data were analysed using Stata version 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Student's t-test, analysis of variance and Pearson's chi-squared test were used to compare groups. Results There were 560 patients who underwent 573 free flaps. The most common indication was trauma. There were 58 re-explorations with a successful salvage rate of 79.3% (46/58). Overall complete flap loss rate was 2.1% (12/573). In flaps requiring re-exploration, there was a higher complete flap loss rate for muscle only flaps versus those with a skin paddle (P-value?=?0.041). Conclusion While timely recognition and re-exploration of the compromised free flap in the early postoperative setting is important in determining the flap salvage success, it is demonstrated that salvage rates are poorer for muscle only flaps compared with flaps with a skin paddle.

AB  - Abstract Significant progress has been made toward improving both the acquisition of clinical diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data and its analysis in the uninjured brain, through various techniques including a large number of model-based solutions that have been proposed to fit for multiple tissue compartments, and multiple fibers per voxel. While some of these techniques have been applied to clinical traumatic brain injury (TBI) research, the majority of these technological enhancements have yet to be fully implemented in the preclinical arena of TBI animal model-based research. In this review, we describe the requirement for preclinical, MRI-based efforts to provide systematic confirmation of the applicability of some of these models as indicators of tissue pathology within the injured brain. We review how current DWI techniques are currently being used in animal TBI models, and describe how both acquisition and analytic techniques could be extended to leverage the progress made in clinical work. Finally, we highlight remaining gaps in the preclinical pipeline from data acquisition to final analysis that currently have no real, preclinical-based correlate.

AB  - SUMMARY Background Trauma is the leading cause of death in children >1 year of age, with haemorrhage as the most common cause of medically preventable deaths. While massive transfusion protocols (MTPs) have been investigated and used in adults to reduce death from haemorrhage, there are a paucity of published data on MTP practices and outcomes in children. This study aimed to survey current MTP policies and the frequency of activation at paediatric care centres. Study design and methods We conducted a survey of MTPs at hospitals in the United States and Canada, including children's general hospitals, children's specialty hospitals and children's units in general hospitals. We collected information on how the MTP is activated, what therapeutics are given, frequency of its use, and how it is audited for compliance. Results Forty-six survey responses were analysed. Physician discretion was the most common activation criteria (89%). A majority of sites (78%) targeted a ?high? (≥1 : 2) ratio of plasma to red blood cells (RBC). Fifteen percent of sites use antifibrinolytics in their MTPs. Eighty nine percent of sites have type-O RBC units and 48% of sites had thawed plasma units stored in an immediately available location. Conclusion There is a wide variation in MTPs among paediatric hospitals with regard to both activation criteria and products administered. This underscores the need for future prospective studies to determine the most effective resuscitation methods for paediatric populations to improve outcomes and therapeutic safety for massive bleeding.

AB  - Summary Topical treatments have been used in wound care for centuries. Many of the treatments, however, have not ? or only to a very limited degree ? undergone scientific scrutiny. This is especially true for many of the products that are available over the counter. Determining the contents of many of these products can be difficult, and as a rule of thumb, products without a list of ingredients should not be used on wounds. In contrast, effects of wound cleansers and solutions used for irrigation have been investigated in several studies. Although cleansers and antiseptics had, for some years, fallen out of favor due to their detrimental effects on cells cultured in vitro, current best evidence suggests that they may be of benefit if used judiciously. The negative impact on cell cultures has, in many studies, not been replicated when the products were used in vivo. Use of antiseptics on heavily contaminated or infected wounds seems to enhance healing through a reduction of the wound's bioburden.
