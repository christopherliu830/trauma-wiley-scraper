AB  - Summary Topical treatments have been used in wound care for centuries. Many of the treatments, however, have not ? or only to a very limited degree ? undergone scientific scrutiny. This is especially true for many of the products that are available over the counter. Determining the contents of many of these products can be difficult, and as a rule of thumb, products without a list of ingredients should not be used on wounds. In contrast, effects of wound cleansers and solutions used for irrigation have been investigated in several studies. Although cleansers and antiseptics had, for some years, fallen out of favor due to their detrimental effects on cells cultured in vitro, current best evidence suggests that they may be of benefit if used judiciously. The negative impact on cell cultures has, in many studies, not been replicated when the products were used in vivo. Use of antiseptics on heavily contaminated or infected wounds seems to enhance healing through a reduction of the wound's bioburden.

AB  - Objective To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the drawer test (DT) alone and in combination with the tibial compression test (TCT) to detect stifle subluxation after transection of the cranial cruciate (CrCL), caudal cruciate (CdCL) or both cruciate ligaments (total cruciate ligament or TCL). Study Design Experimental study. Sample Population Cadaveric, skeletally mature canine pelvic limb pairs (n = 8). Methods Pelvic limbs disarticulated at the coxofemoral joint were randomly assigned to the following 1 of 4 groups: (1) limbs had complete transection of the CrCL; (2) limbs had complete transection of the CdCL; (3) limbs had complete transection of both ligaments; and (4) both ligaments were left intact. Participants performed the DT and the TCT and a diagnosis was given based on the DT and on the combination of these tests. Results DT had a poor sensitivity for correctly identifying CrCL (69%), CdCL (45%), and TCL (26%) rupture, but had a high sensitivity when identifying intact limbs (97%). Specificity for DT was greatest when identifying limbs with CdCL (97%) and TCL (92%) rupture, and the lowest when palpating limbs with CrCL rupture (75%). Combining DT and TCT did not increase sensitivity or specificity values, nor did an increased level of evaluator training. Conclusions Independent of evaluator training, the DT alone or combined with the TCT poorly differentiates the cause of stifle instability associated with CrCL, CdCL, and TCL rupture.

AB  - Abstract Surgical sutures are used to facilitate closure and healing of surgical- or trauma-induced wounds by upholding tissues together to facilitate healing process. There is a wide range of suture materials for medical purpose and the main types include absorbable and nonabsorbable. Recently, there is a growth in the development of classes of suture materials based on their properties and capabilities to improve tissue approximation and wound closure. This review outlines and discusses the current and emerging trends in suture technology including knotless barbed sutures, antimicrobial sutures, bio-active sutures such as drug-eluting and stem cells seeded sutures, and smart sutures including elastic, and electronic sutures. These newer strategies expand the versatility of sutures from being used as just a physical entity approximating opposing tissues to a more biologically active component enabling delivery of drugs and cells to the desired site with immense application potential in both therapeutics and diagnostics. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background Delirium is highly prevalent within critical care and is linked to adverse clinical outcomes, increased mortality and impaired quality of life. Development of delirium is thought to be caused by multiple risk factors, including disruption of the circadian rhythm. Chronotherapeutic interventions, such as light therapy, music and use of eye shades, have been suggested as an option to improve circadian rhythm within intensive care units. Aim This review aims to answer the question: Can chronotherapy reduce the prevalence of delirium in adult patients in critical care? Design This study is a systematic review of quantitative studies. Research Method Six major electronic databases were searched, and a hand search was undertaken using selected key search terms. Research quality was assessed using the critical appraisal skills programme tools. The studies were critically appraised by both authors independently, and data were extracted. Four themes addressing the research question were identified and critically evaluated. Findings Six primary research articles that investigated different methods of chronotherapy were identified, and the results suggest that multi-component non-pharmacological interventions are the most effective for reducing the prevalence of delirium in critical care. The melatonergic agonist Ramelteon demonstrated statistically significant reductions in delirium; however, the reliability of the results in answering the review question was limited by the research design. The use of bright light therapy (BLT) and dynamic light application had mixed results, with issues with the research design and outcomes measured limiting the validity of the findings. Conclusion Multi-component non-pharmacological interventions, such as noise and light control, can reduce delirium in critical care, whereas other interventions, such as BLT, have mixed outcomes. Melatonin, as a drug, may be a useful alternative to sedative-hypnotics. Relevance to Clinical Practice Chronotherapy can reduce the incidence of delirium within critical care, although further research is warranted. Staff education is essential in the implementation of chronotherapy.

AB  - Aim.? This paper presents the findings of a staff survey conducted at a 350-bed acute care facility located on the periphery of Toronto, Canada. Background.? Toronto's severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis resulted in trauma-like effects at hospitals hardest hit by the disease. A systematic examination of the impact on staff working in hospitals that saw relatively few cases, while maintaining the precautions associated with elevated alert levels, has not been undertaken. Methods.? A questionnaire was distributed for 1?month commencing 17 April 2003 and 300 completed responses were obtained (approximately one in six staff members). The data collected included demographic and occupational information, in addition to perceptions of SARS? impact on patient care, factors contributing to adverse impacts on patient care, working conditions, decision-making, communication and relations, sources of support, and the impact on workers? lives outside work. Items for these sections were developed by a multi-disciplinary team of health care workers and hospital administrators. Results.? In the absence of pre-SARS normative data for the survey, demographic and occupational variables were used to look for patterns of differences between relevant subgroups of respondents. Statistically significant differences were found for gender (73·9% women), nurses (24·7%) vs. others, doctors (20·3%) vs. others, older (40?years or older, 60·0%) vs. younger persons, emergency or intensive care unit workers (8·0%) vs. others, and those employed fewer years at the hospital (less than 5?years: 46·2%) vs. five or more years. These differences varied across the following domains: factors adversely affecting patients, communications, support, working conditions, decision-making and, to a lesser extent, impact on life outside work. While all groups found SARS stressful, nurses reported a greater impact on morale and job satisfaction. Nurses relied more on peer support than doctors, felt less informed and less involved in decision-making than doctors felt, and were more likely to report that infection control procedures were not strict enough. Conclusions.? The between-group differences and the pattern of these differences clearly illustrate the polarizing and stressful impact SARS had at a hospital with only a small number of probable or suspect cases. The clear differences between groups defined by demographics, professions and clinical roles suggest a subtle and pervasive secondary impact of the SARS outbreak, with repercussions health care facilities must contend with while maintaining increased levels of vigilance in the wake of SARS.

AB  - Abstract Cell death occurs by one of two mechanisms: apoptosis (programmed cell death) or necrosis due to cellular injury or trauma. Each method has distinct morphological and biochemical characteristics. Distinguishing between apoptosis and necrosis depends selection of appropriate assays and proper timing. This unit provides an extensive series of assays that measure membrane integrity, cell size and DNA content, state of chromatin, DNA fragmentation, and caspase activation. The results of these assays allow one to distinguish between apoptosis and necrosis.

AB  - Summary Minimally invasive endoscopic intracardiac surgery including one lung ventilation has been proposed to decrease surgical trauma but its impact on oxygenation and resource consumption has not been reported. We compared effects on gas exchange, induction, total anaesthesia time, staffing costs, and complications in 42 consecutive patients to a matched group undergoing similar surgery conventionally. Use of endoscopic compared to conventional surgery evoked a decrease in the Pao2/FIo2 ratio (mean (SD) 24.1 (14.9) vs 48.9 (14) kPa, p?<?0.05) following termination of bypass with one lung ventilation (10 patients showed a Pao2/Fio2 below 13.3 kPa (100?mmHg)). There was also an increase of anaesthesia induction time (47 (13) vs 31 (9) min, p?<?0.05), and an increase by 156?min of total anaesthesia time (474 (89) vs 321 (69) min, p?<?0.05). Anaesthetist staffing costs increased by 300%. Thus, minimally invasive endoscopic intracardiac surgery consumes many more anaesthesia resources than conventional surgery and can result in hypoxaemia, but overall can be considered feasible provided that extensive continuous monitoring is employed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Of the various virulence mechanisms of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the type III secretion system (TTSS) has been characterized as a major factor associated with acute lung injury, bacteremia and mortality. In addition, PcrV, a component protein of the TTSS, has been characterized as a protective antigen against infection with P. aeruginosa. This study comprised an epidemiological analysis of serum anti-PcrV titers in a cohort of Japanese adults. From April 2012 to March 2013, serum anti-PcrV titers of 198 volunteer participants undergoing anesthesia for scheduled surgeries were measured. The median, minimum and maximum serum anti-PcrV titers among the 198 participants were 4.09?nM, 1.01?nM and 113.81?nM, respectively. The maximum peaks in the histogram were within the anti-PcrV 2.00?4.99?nM titer range; values for 115 participants (58.1%) were within this range. Anti-PcrV titers were more than approximately three-fold greater (>12?nM) than the median value in 21 participants (10.6%). Ten-year interval age increases, history of treatment for traffic trauma, and a history of past surgery each showed statistically significant associations with higher anti-PcrV titers (i.e., >10?nM) than did the other factors assessed by binomial analysis. This study revealed a considerable variation in anti-PcrV titers in adult subjects without any obvious histories of infection with P. aeruginosa.

AB  - Summary The toxicities of cocaine are far-ranging. They include sudden death, acute medical and psychiatric illness, infectious complications, reproductive disturbances, trauma, criminal activities and societal disruption, including child neglect and abuse and lost job productivity. This chapter focuses on the medical complications. Medical complications in general reflect the intense sympathomimetic activities of cocaine (?sympathetic neural storm?). Psychiatric complications include acute anxiety or panic and paranoid psychosis. Cardiovascular complications include arrhythmias and sudden death, acute myocardial infarction, myocarditis, dissecting aneurysm and bowel infarction. Neurological complications include seizure, intracerebral haemorrhage and brain injury due to hyperthermia and/or seizures, and headache. The incidence of medical complications has been estimated using two databases collected prospectively in the United States. In 1989 and 1990 cocaine ranked first in total encounters, major medical complications and drug-related deaths. An attempt was made to assess the intrinsic toxicity of cocaine by computing the incidence of adverse health outcomes per population of drug abusers. Rates of emergency department visits and deaths were 15.1 and 0.5 respectively, per 1000 persons using drugs in the past year. The magnitude of the cocaine problem, while considerable, is relatively small compared with that of cigarette smoking or alcohol abuse.

International Journal of Older People Nursing?5, 63?70?doi: 10.1111/j.1748-3743.2008.00205.x Older people sit at the centre of a unique constellation of factors that combine to increase their vulnerability to the negative effects of catastrophic events. The aim of this paper is to explore some of the factors that underlie this vulnerability. Attention will be directed at three broad factors that will be discussed in some depth, namely poverty, long standing health conditions and psychological trauma. The aim is not, however, to provide a comprehensive systematic review of existing research evidence regarding the older person and disasters. This is due in part to the paucity of studies that take as their primary focus the older population and disasters. Whilst poverty, chronic illness and psychological issues are discussed in this paper as separate issues, they are interconnected. A map of the synergies between factors is presented that places the older person at the centre of a network of vulnerabilities. Recommendations for strategic planning and clinical practice are made that address this complex problem. The hope is that with insightful preparation the older population can be spared then worse consequences of a disaster when it strikes.

AB  - Abstract. The dab, Limanda limanda (L.), is a common species of flatfish found in the shallow waters of the North Sea, particularly in inshore regions. Because of its distribution and habits, it is a useful species for investigations into the biological effects of marine pollution; it is also susceptible to certain, easily-detectable, gross diseases, including a variety of hepatic lesions, some of which are putative neoplasias. Investigations over the past 10 years on the histopathology of dab livers, have revealed that many lesions are associated with parasitic infections or trauma, and others include the presence of basophilic foci and putative adenoma as well as cell storage changes. The significance of these lesions is discussed in relation to other biological and physical data, and the necessity for histological evaluation is emphasized.

International Journal of Older People Nursing6, 110?122 doi: 10.1111/j.1748-3743.2010.00226.x Aims and objectives.? This paper presents a critical review of the literature related to the violence staff in care homes experience from people with dementia. It attempts to identify the psychological consequences abuse has on care workers and the implications this has for practice. Background.? Abuse in the form of violence or aggression against healthcare professionals is not new. However, when this is from residents with dementia in care homes it is considered to be part of the job. Consequently it is largely underreported and ignored which masks its true extent. Conclusion.? The magnitude of violence in care homes crosses cultural boundaries. Fear of being blamed, job insecurity and resignation that abuse should be accepted as part of the job is unique to this care setting. The cumulative effect of psychological abuse leads to emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation which results in care workers emotionally and physically withdrawing from residents. Being subjected to abuse, feeling undervalued, unsupported and lacking essential skills may compromise a workforces? ability to provide person-centred care. A rising ageing population and prevalence of dementia will place demands on commissioners and providers to deliver high quality care. Consistent recording and reporting procedures, dementia specific training and infrastructures to support staff is therefore crucial.

AB  - Summary The journey from emerging technology to therapeutic paradigm change follows a rocky road. The development of monoclonal antibodies as a commercially viable industry exemplifies this. Several technological S-curves have been navigated to make mAbs the conventional pharmaceuticals that they have become today: from discovery and engineering to clinical translation and industrial scale manufacturing. The transformational nature of these new molecules has generated a multi-billion dollar global industry. A historic recollection of the defining events that shaped the mAb technology is particularly relevant to regenerative medicine in general and therapeutic stem cells in particular. A point of inflexion in the value of mAb transactions occurred with the commercial success of the first mAb blockbuster (rituximab), triggering multi-billion USD licensing transactions and very large M (3) enhancement of biological attributes, (4) combination with conventional drugs, (5) delivery devices and formulation, and (6) solid organ transplantation. Each co-evolutionary advance contributes to the clinical, economic and access to care value proposition that makes or breaks a technology, as it transitions from bench to bedside.

AB  - Abstract Background The Australasian Resuscitation In Sepsis Evaluation (ARISE) study is an international, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of early goal-directed therapy compared with standard care for patients presenting to the ED with severe sepsis. Objective In keeping with current practice, and taking into considerations aspects of trial design and reporting specific to non-pharmacologic interventions, this document outlines the principles and methods for analysing and reporting the trial results. The document is prepared prior to completion of recruitment into the ARISE study, without knowledge of the results of the interim analysis conducted by the data safety and monitoring committee and prior to completion of the two related international studies. Methods The statistical analysis plan was designed by the ARISE chief investigators, and reviewed and approved by the ARISE steering committee. The data collected by the research team as specified in the study protocol, and detailed in the study case report form were reviewed. Information related to baseline characteristics, characteristics of delivery of the trial interventions, details of resuscitation and other related therapies, and other relevant data are described with appropriate comparisons between groups. The primary, secondary and tertiary outcomes for the study are defined, with description of the planned statistical analyses. Results A statistical analysis plan was developed, along with a trial profile, mock-up tables and figures. A plan for presenting baseline characteristics, microbiological and antibiotic therapy, details of the interventions, processes of care and concomitant therapies, along with adverse events are described. The primary, secondary and tertiary outcomes are described along with identification of subgroups to be analysed. Conclusion A statistical analysis plan for the ARISE study has been developed, and is available in the public domain, prior to the completion of recruitment into the study. This will minimise analytic bias and conforms to current best practice in conducting clinical trials.

AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative disease that commonly affects the elderly. Current drug therapies for treating OA may cause adverse side effects, and so there remains a need to develop alternative treatments. Bergapten (BG) is a coumarin phytohormone that is widely found in fruits and has antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. Here, we tested the hypothesis that BG may restrict the progression of OA by examining its effect on OA chondrocytes. We observed that BG significantly ameliorated interleukin (IL)-1?-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines and mediators, including interleukin 1 (Il-1), interleukin 6 (Il-6), tumor necrosis factor α (Tnf-α), cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2) and matrix metalloproteinase 13 (Mmp-13), maintained chondrocyte phenotype, and promoted the secretion of cartilage-specific extracellular matrix. We provide evidence that BG exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by activating the ANP32A/ATM signaling pathway, which was recently verified to be associated with OA. In conclusion, these findings indicate that BG may be a potential candidate for treatment of OA.

AB  - Ammonia was necessary for the origin of life. However, NH3 would not have been a significant component of the neutral or mildly reducing (N2, CO2, H2O) atmosphere which characterized the Hadean earth (>3·8 Gyr ago), especially in view of the u.v. lability of NH3, the greater u.v. output of the young sun than pertains today, and the absence of an atmospheric u.v. screen. Heterogeneous phase reactions, following atmospheric chemistry, have been proposed as a prebiotic NH3 source. Lightning, or bolides (meteorites and comets), generated NOx., and Fe2+ in the sea could have reduced NO2? resulting from the NOx. to NH4+; this disequilibrium NH4+ level could have supported the production of the nitrogenous organic building blocks of life. NOx. and NHy thus could both have had important roles in the origin and evolution of life. Burgeoning biota could soon have depleted abiotically generated NH4+, and biological N2 fixation could have evolved in its present Fe-demanding, O2-sensitive forms in the Archaean O2-free, Fe2+-rich environment. Organic matter could have driven biological denitrification reactions based on NO2? and NO3? generated abiologically using some redox components which evolved in earlier chemolithotrophs and photolithotrophs, regenerating atmospheric NOx. and producing N2O. Any atmospheric NH3 leaking from oceanic biology would have been subject to u.v. breakdown and rain-out. Although O2-evolving photosynthesis probably began in the Archean some 3·5 Gyr ago, any O2 accumulation was local until 2·0 Gyr ago (Proterozoic) due to consumption by oxidation of Fe2+ and S2?. However, localized O2 accumulation before 2·0 Gyr ago could account for the observed early evolution of cytochrome oxidase and the possibility of O2-consuming chemolithotrophic and chemoorganotrophic nitrification, with further possibilities of NOx. production. Oxygen accumulation globally from 2·0 Gyr onwards coincided approximately with the evolution of eukaryotes, which contributed phagotrophy to the reactions of the N cycle as well as the nutrification-like aerobic production of NO. by nitric oxide synthetase, while lightning and bolides could now generate NO. from N2 and O2. Evidence for terrestrial ecosystems is found from 1·0 Gyr onwards; NOx. and NH3 generated by terrestrial biota stands a greater chance of escaping to the atmosphere than do these compounds generated in the sea where recycling within the water body is likely. As CO2 levels fell and O2 levels rose, NH3 cycling in the photorespiratory carbon oxidation cycle might have been evident as early as 1 Gyr ago, although this does not seem to be a major contributor to atmospheric NH3 today. Embryophyte evolution on land 450 Myr ago, together with symbionts and biophages, increased primary productivity and N cycling on land, with greater quantitative possibilities for NOx. and NH3 escape to the atmosphere. The evolution of lignin (and related phenylpropanoids) at least 400 Myr ago, with associated NH3 recycling in vascular land plant, does not seem (on present evidence) to increase NH3 loss to the atmosphere significantly. Biomass burning occurred at least 350 Myr ago with lightning as the likely ignition source; such burning yielded NO., NH3, N2O and N2 from organic N. As in earlier times, the existence of terrestrial embryophyte vegetation has been punctuated by major bolide impacts, with the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary impact generating perhaps 104 as much NO. as a year's thunderstorms do today, although the toxicity of NOx.per se to vegetation might not have been the major effect of the NOx. on biota. Terrestrial plants suffered fewer extinctions at this time than did many other major taxa. Despite such very significant generators of atmospheric combined N as major bolide impacts, the mean levels of NHy, NOx. and N2O (and O3) in the atmosphere during the 450 Myr existence of embryophyte vegetation was lower than the current, globally averaged, anthropogenically influenced values. Current globally averaged levels of atmospheric combined N are thus not without precedent in the history of life, globally for NOx., and locally for NHy, so vegetation has had evolutionary experience of high atmospheric combined N. However, this should not make us complacent about the impact of current wide-spread and continuing anthropogenic inputs of combined N, in view of the rate and extent of the inputs, and their combination with other aspects of local anthropogenic influence (e.g. SO2 from burning of high-S coal), stratospheric O3 depletion, and global environmental change (increasing CO2, temperature and sea-level).

AB  - Mucinous metaplasia occurs uncommonly in cutaneous pathology, usually at specialized anatomic locations (genitalia, palms, soles) and within restricted pathologic contexts (inflammation, trauma). Here we report a unique case of eccrine mucinous metaplasia associated with an apocrine cystadenoma. A 13-year-old girl had an asymptomatic, 4-mm nodule on the chest. Histopathology demonstrated a typical apocrine cystadenoma in the upper and middle dermis. Adjacent to this neoplasm was a cluster of coiled eccrine secretory ducts, of which the inner layer was almost entirely replaced by benign-appearing cells containing abundant, non-sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides. At eight months? follow-up, there was no recurrence. Our case demonstrates that, very uncommonly, mucinous metaplasia may be associated with a pathogenetically separate, adjacent neoplasm, in this instance an apocrine cystadenoma.

AB  - ABSTRACT Focal ischemic chondronecrosis of epiphyseal growth cartilage (EGC) during endochondral ossification is believed to be a key early event on the pathway to osteochondrosis (OC) in both animals and humans. The lateral ridge of the equine trochlea is a site where severe osteochondritis dissecans lesions frequently arise and is a model for the study of naturally occurring disease. Non-invasive imaging to investigate EGC vascularity may help elucidate why focal ischemia occurs. 3T MRI susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) of femoral trochlea of OC predisposed (n?=?10) and control (n?=?6) day-old foals, with minimal joint loading after birth, was performed. SWI and 3D images revealed the EGC vascular architecture without a contrast agent, and matched histologic observations. No vascular lesions were identified. There was no difference in the vascular density and architecture between control and OC specimens, but a striking difference in vascular pattern was seen at the OC-predilected site in the lateral ridge of the trochlea in all specimens, when compared to the medial ridge of the trochlea, where OC lesions are rarely observed. This site was less ossified with more perichondrial vessels not yet bridging with the subchondral bone. Furthermore, the mean vascular density of all specimens was significantly higher at this site. We speculate that joint morphology and focal internal trauma on this site with a unique vascular architecture may trigger ischemic events at this site. SWI permitted visualization of EGC in young foals with a clinical 3T MRI and paves the way for non-destructive longitudinal studies to improve understanding of OC in all species. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.
