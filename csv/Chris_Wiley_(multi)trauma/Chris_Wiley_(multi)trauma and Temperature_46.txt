AB  - ABSTRACT Focal ischemic chondronecrosis of epiphyseal growth cartilage (EGC) during endochondral ossification is believed to be a key early event on the pathway to osteochondrosis (OC) in both animals and humans. The lateral ridge of the equine trochlea is a site where severe osteochondritis dissecans lesions frequently arise and is a model for the study of naturally occurring disease. Non-invasive imaging to investigate EGC vascularity may help elucidate why focal ischemia occurs. 3T MRI susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) of femoral trochlea of OC predisposed (n?=?10) and control (n?=?6) day-old foals, with minimal joint loading after birth, was performed. SWI and 3D images revealed the EGC vascular architecture without a contrast agent, and matched histologic observations. No vascular lesions were identified. There was no difference in the vascular density and architecture between control and OC specimens, but a striking difference in vascular pattern was seen at the OC-predilected site in the lateral ridge of the trochlea in all specimens, when compared to the medial ridge of the trochlea, where OC lesions are rarely observed. This site was less ossified with more perichondrial vessels not yet bridging with the subchondral bone. Furthermore, the mean vascular density of all specimens was significantly higher at this site. We speculate that joint morphology and focal internal trauma on this site with a unique vascular architecture may trigger ischemic events at this site. SWI permitted visualization of EGC in young foals with a clinical 3T MRI and paves the way for non-destructive longitudinal studies to improve understanding of OC in all species. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Objectives: 1) Describe the clinical course and diagnostic findings of cats with histopathologic evidence of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 2) Identify risk factors for ALI/ARDS in cats. Animals: Sixty-five client-owned cats with moderate to severe interstitial pneumonia, pneumonitis or alveolitis consistent with ALI/ARDS on post-mortem examination and clinical evidence of respiratory compromise. Procedure: Retrospective evaluation of medical records, postmortem examination and radiographs. Results: Cats in this study tended to be middle aged (mean 6.5±4.9 years). They had a short duration of illness (median 4 days; range 0?120 days) and of dyspnea (median 1 day; range 1?7 days). On presentation, the cats were tachypneic (mean respiratory rate 53±23?bpm) and relatively bradycardic (mean heart rate 166±43?bpm). The majority of cats were dyspneic (n=39) at presentation; all others developed respiratory difficulties during hospitalization. The mean white blood cell count was within normal limits (14.6±14.0?k/?L); 8 cats had a leukocytosis and 7 were leucopenic. Clinical findings consistent with SIRS (n=39) and sepsis (n=10) were common. Thoracic radiographs were reviewed in 31 cats and alveolar disease was the most frequent pattern (105 lung lobes) followed by interstitial disease (86 lung lobes). No cat had normal thoracic radiographs throughout hospitalization. Underlying disease was not identified on post-mortem examination in 15 cats (23%), but in the remaining cats underlying diseases included infectious systemic disease (n=11), neoplasia (n=8), respiratory (n=8) and urinary (n=7) system disorders, acute pancreatitis (n=7), hepatic diseases (n=5), major trauma (n=4), sepsis (n=3), CNS (n=2) and other systems (n=5). Nine cats had more then one underlying process. Conclusions: This study describes a naturally-occurring syndrome of ALI/ARDS in cats analogous to that which occurs in dogs and humans. In cats, ALI/ARDS occurs as a sequela of a variety of underlying systemic diseases, but in approximately one-quarter of patients an underlying cause is not identified at necropsy. It is important to consider ALI/ARDS in systemically ill cats who become dyspneic; in cats with pulmonary disease with acute worsening of respiratory status and in cats with pulmonary infiltrates for which no other cause can be identified.

AB  - ABSTRACT The murine dorsum dermal excisional wound model has been widely utilized with or without splint application. However, variations in experimental methods create challenges for direct comparison of results provided in the literature and for design of new wound healing studies. Here, we investigated the effects of wound location and size, number of wounds, type of adhesive used for splint fixation on wound healing using splinted or unsplinted dorsum excisional full thickness wound models. One or two 6- or 8-mm full thickness wounds were made with or without splinting in genetically diabetic but heterozygous mice (Dock7m?+?/?+?Leprdb). Two different adhesives: tissue adhesive and an over the counter cyanoacrylate adhesive (OTCA) ?Krazy glue? were used to fix splints. Wound contraction, wound closure, and histopathological parameters including reepithelialization, collagen deposition and inflammation were compared between groups. No significant effect of wound number (1 vs. 2), side (left vs. right and cranial vs. caudal) or size on wound healing was observed. The OTCA group had a significantly higher splint success compared to the tissue adhesive group that resulted in significantly higher reepithelialization and collagen deposition in the OTCA group. Understanding the outcomes and effects of the variables will help investigators choose appropriate experimental conditions for the study purpose and interpret data.

AB  - Abstract Acrolein, a major lipid peroxidation product, has been associated with both CNS trauma and neurodegenerative diseases. Because of its long half-life, acrolein is a potent endogenous toxin capable of killing healthy cells during the secondary injury process. Traditionally, attempts to intervene in the process of progressive cell death after the primary injury have included scavenging reactive oxygen species (so-called free radicals). The animal data supporting such an approach have generally been positive, but all human clinical trials attempting a similar outcome in human CNS injury have failed. New drugs that might reduce toxicity by scavenging the products of lipid peroxidation present a promising, and little investigated, therapeutic approach. Hydralazine, a well-known treatment for hypertension, has been reported to react with acrolein, forming hydrazone in cell-free systems. In the companion paper, we have established an acrolein-mediated cell injury model using PC12 cells in vitro. Here we test the hypothesis that the formation of hydrazone adducts with acrolein is able to reduce acrolein toxicity and spare a significant percentage of the population of PC12 cells from death. Concentrations of approximately 1 mM of this aldehyde scavenger can rescue over 80% of the population of PC12 cells. This study provides a basis for a new pharmacological treatment to reduce the effects of secondary injury in the damaged and/or diseased nervous system. In particular, we describe the need for new drugs that possess aldehyde scavenging properties but do not interfere with the regulation of blood pressure. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract? The superficial regions of the dog splanchnic nerve were selectively stimulated with 33-electrode spiral cuffs in 11 circumferential groups of three electrodes to modulate the function of the innervated internal organs and glands. In two adult Beagle dogs under general anaesthesia, the cuffs were chronically implanted on the nerve trunks before the celiac ganglion. Superficial regions of the nerves were selectively stimulated for 15?s with biphasic, rectangular, current pulses (2?mA intensity, 200?µs duration, and 20?Hz frequency) which were delivered sequentially to the corresponding group of three electrodes. The results showed that Group no. 8 of three electrodes elicited the highest influence on pressure within the bladder. Namely, a decrease in pressure starting from 34.97?mmHg at the beginning of stimulation to 34.92?mmHg at the end of stimulation was observed. It was also shown that only Group no. 4 of three electrodes significantly modified the endocrine function of the pancreas. A considerable increase in glucagon secretion with a peak value of 47?pg/ml and an insignificant change in insulin secretion were also observed. The results of histological observations demonstrated that the use of the cuff was associated with a buildup of connective tissue encapsulation around the cuff as well as within it. However, functional deficits were not observed in the animal, and most of the fibers appeared to be histologically normal after stimulation. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that internal organs and glands can be selectively stimulated through the selective stimulation of innervating superficial regions of the autonomous peripheral nerve.

AB  - Objective? To report complications observed using a hydro-pool recovery system after general anesthesia in horses. Study design? Retrospective study. Animals? Sixty horses. Methods? Retrospective review of the medical records and quality of recovery from anesthesia of 60 horses that had surgical or diagnostic procedures under general anesthesia. Results? Mean total anesthesia time was 182 minutes (range, 25 to 390 minutes). Mean time in the hydro-pool was 108 minutes (range, 20 to 270 minutes). One horse that had bilateral rear limb extensor weakness while recovering in a padded recovery stall was moved to the hydro-pool and maintained for 12 hours. Ten horses developed some pulmonary edema; in 3 horses, the signs of pulmonary edema were severe; and 1 horse died from related complications. One horse developed septic arthritis of an operated stifle joint, and 2 horses developed incisional infections. Two horses incurred multiple skin abrasions on the distal aspect of their limbs during violent attempts to leave the pool. Conclusions? A hydro-pool system was useful for recovering horses from general anesthesia when difficult recoveries were anticipated because of the horse's injury, size, demeanor, duration of anesthesia, or risk of further injury. Recovery using the hydro-pool was more time and labor intensive than a standard stall recovery. Pulmonary edema that required treatment was a serious complication that occurred in 17% of the horses. Careful closure of the skin with cyanoacrylate glue and pressure from bandages were used to prevent postoperative incisional infections. Clinical relevance? A hydro-pool system is a useful method for recovering horses from general anesthesia when difficult recoveries are anticipated.

AB  - Objective? To compare the biomechanical properties of cervical arthroplasty to a ventral slot procedure and pin-polymethylmethacrylate (pin-PMMA) fixation. Sample Population? Fresh cadaveric cervical (C2?T1) spines from 6 large dogs. Methods? Four spinal conditions were studied in each spinal specimen: intact, disk arthroplasty, ventral slot, and fixation with smooth pin-PMMA at C5?C6 intervertebral space. Axial compression, torsion, flexion?extension, and lateral bending moments were sequentially tested on each specimen for the 4 spinal conditions. Data from the C3?C4, C4?C5, C5?C6, and C6?C7 vertebral motion units (VMUs) were compared among treatments. Results? In axial compression and torsion, the ventral slot procedure allowed significantly less motion than intact, pin-PMMA, and arthroplasty groups at C5?C6. In lateral bending and flexion?extension, pin-PMMA had the least motion of C5?C6, followed by the arthroplasty group, intact spine, and ventral slot, all of which were significantly different from each other. Overall, the artificial disk was better able to mimic the behavior of the intact specimens compared with the ventral slot and pin-PMMA, producing similar displacements in axial compression and rotation in torsion, but more limited motion than intact in flexion?extension and in lateral bending. Conclusion? Cervical spine specimens with an implanted prosthesis have biomechanical behaviors more similar to an intact spine compared with spinal specimens with ventral slot and pin-PMMA procedures. Cervical arthroplasty may then preserve some of the motion in the affected area after neural decompression while providing distraction. Clinical Relevance? Cervical arthroplasty should be further investigated in vivo to determine if it is a viable alternative to the ventral slot or pin-PMMA procedures for surgical treatment of cervical diseases in dogs and in particular for treatment of disk-associated caudal cervical spondylomyelopathy.

AB  - Ginkgolide B (GB) is a selective and strong antagonist of platelet-activating factor with great benefits in CNS diseases treatment. The renal excretion constitutes the predominant secretory pathway of GB. Here, we investigated the potential role of renal drug transporters in GB urinary excretion. The intravenous administration of GB was conducted at 10?min post-administration of probenecid (potential inhibitor of organic anion transporters/organic anion transporting polypeptides) or bromosulfophthalein (traditional inhibitor of multi-drug resistance proteins) in rats. Pretreated with probenecid, the systemic exposure of GB was significantly elevated from 8.319?±?1.646 to 14.75?±?1.328 µg?·?mL?1∙h but with reduced total clearance from 1.17?±?0.331 to 0.596?±?0.0573 L?·?h?1∙kg?1 accompanying no changes in plasma elimination half-lives compared with control group. With no pronounced effect on metabolic elimination, the decreased total clearance was closely pertained to the reduced renal excretion, indicating the potential effect of organic anion transporters and/or organic anion transporting polypeptides in renal secretory of GB from blood to urine. However, the possible effect of bromosulfophthalein was restricted within a minor extent, suggesting the mild role of multi-drug resistance protein in GB renal excretion.

AB  - Objectives: To prospectively investigate the incidence of mechanical and infectious complications associated with the use of jugular catheters and risk factors for these complications. Methods: Data was collected over a 6-month period and risk factors associated with the occurrence of mechanical or inflammatory complications were investigated. Results: One hundred catheters were placed over a 6-month period, totalling 393 catheter days. Complications were seen in 39% of catheters with a total of 51 complications. Forty-one of these complications were mechanical. A total of 10 inflammatory or infectious complications were identified in eight catheters (a total of 0·03 infectious complications per catheter day). Complications were more likely to occur in patients requiring more than one attempt for placement and patients that were ASA status 3 to 5. Infectious complications were more likely in patients not having general anaesthesia for placement, those having medical rather than surgical disease and those placed out of theatre. No association was found between the skill of the person placing the catheter and risk of complication. Clinical Significance: Mechanical complications are frequently associated with jugular catheter placement. Identification of risk factors for complications is important and warrants further study.

AB  - Feline obstructive ureteral disease will likely remain a common and frustrating cause of critical illness in cats for the foreseeable future. Since many cats are uraemic and cardiovascularly unstable secondary to obstructive nephropathy, prompt recognition using clinical intuition, blood work and diagnostic imaging is essential to make a timely diagnosis and decision about timing for intervention, if indicated. Multiple surgical and interventional procedures exist for the management of feline ureteral obstructions but there is no ideal technique and all currently available procedures carry risk of infection, re-obstruction, urine leakage and the need for additional procedures in the future. Therefore, until clear, evidence-based guideline exist, the decision about which ureteral procedure to perform in cats should be guided by nature of the obstruction, location, concurrent urolithiasis, infection and surgeon preference. In all likelihood, ureteral surgery, stents and ureteral bypass devices will continue to remain viable options and the decision about which procedure to use will be made on a case-by-case basis.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare short-term postoperative mortality in dogs after splenectomy performed with or without a bipolar vessel sealing device (BVSD) and to identify variables associated with mortality. Study design Retrospective study. Sample population Client-owned dogs (n = 203). Methods Medical records of dogs that underwent splenectomy from 2005-2018 were reviewed. Mortality rates were compared between dogs that underwent splenectomy with or without BVSD. Causes of death and variables associated with short-term mortality were assessed. Results Fifteen of 203 (7.4%) dogs died prior to discharge, and seven (3.4%) dogs died prior to suture removal for a total short-term mortality rate of 22 of 203 (10.8%). The estimated difference in proportion of deaths prior to discharge between the BVSD and non-BVSD groups was ?0.01 (95% confidence interval = ?0.08 to 0.06). Duration of anesthesia was longer when splenectomy was performed without BVSD (median 168 vs 152?minutes; P = .03). Multivariate analysis identified intraoperative (odds ratio [OR] 5.7) or postoperative (OR 13.6) administration of blood products, increasing duration of anesthesia (OR 1.15 per additional 16?minutes), and intraoperative ventricular arrhythmias (OR 6.8) as significantly associated with death prior to discharge. Intraoperative (OR 3.2) or postoperative (OR 7.7) administration of blood products was associated with death prior to suture removal. Conclusion Use of a BVSD did not appear to increase short-term mortality after splenectomy. Clinical significance Dogs undergoing splenectomy that require intraoperative or postoperative transfusions, experience intraoperative ventricular arrhythmias, or have prolonged anesthesia may be at risk for death in the short-term postoperative period.

AB  - Abstract Stem cell-based therapy may be the most promising method to cure skeletal muscle degenerative diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and trauma in the future. Human amniotic fluid is enriched with early-stage stem cells from developing fetuses and these cells have cardiomyogenic potential both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we investigated the characteristics of human amniotic fluid-derived AF-type stem (HAF-AFS) cells by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation analysis. After confirming the stemness of HAF-AFS cells, we tested whether HAF-AFS cells could differentiate into skeletal myogenic cells in vitro and incorporate into regenerating skeletal muscle in vivo. By temporary exposure to the DNA demethylation agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza dC) or co-cultured with C2C12 myoblasts, HAF-AFS cells differentiated into skeletal myogenic cells, expressing skeletal myogenic cell-specific markers such as Desmin, Troponin I (Tn I) and α-Actinin. Four weeks after transplantation into cardiotoxin-injured and X-ray-irradiated tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of NOD/SCID mice, HAF-AFS cells survived, differentiated into myogenic precursor cells and fused with host myofibres. The findings that HAF-AFS cells differentiate into myogenic cells in vitro and incorporate in skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo hold the promise of HAF-AFS cell-based therapy for skeletal muscle degenerative diseases.

AB  - Summary The overall success rate for aphakic contact lens wear is related to motivation. It is highest in bilateral cases. Most successful results occur in physically and mentally active individuals, and poorest results in the unilateral alphakic, especially in infancy. Prolonged, or extended wear gives hope to many patients at the extremes of age. The criteria for extended wear is high gas flow materials, perfection in optical finish, and best fitting lens form. When considering the different materials available and their physio-chemical properties, attention must be paid to the lens form. Thus high plasticity and low elasticity means a large lens, and high elasticity a small thin lens. The problems of constant wear are still sufficiently serious to make such lenses experimental in use. Thus infect/on can occur secondary to chronic oedema and trauma of the surface epithelium. Infection may be introduced at the time of insertion, but also arises by the abnormal environment produced by contact lens wear resulting in gram negative pathogenic organisms invading the cornea. Whilst the aphakic eye may be an easy eye to fit and tolerate the lens, this may mask the onset of chronic oedema and neovascularisation. Studies in the Contact Lens Department at Moorfields using 85% Sauflon and 75% Duragel indicate over 50% of aphakics in the adult group wear soft lenses constantly for several months, but new lenses are often required every six months and in children more often. Better surfaced lenses are necessary before a safer system will result to encourage prolonged wear.

AB  - This paper describes the evaluation, initial psychotherapy and subsequent psychoanalysis of an adolescent who presented with a severe psychosomatic process involving total body pain and profound fatigue. The author details the complex and multifaceted nature of the psychosomatic process as it unfolded in the treatment. The psychosomatic problem was not a single entity, but rather was comprised of diverse interwoven elements such as somatization, conversion on pre-oedipal and oedipal levels, conflicts over aggression, sexuality, identity, masochism, secondary gain, anaclitic depression, internalized self-other interactions with a depressed mother and transgenerational transmission of trauma. The author uses the case material to discuss technical approaches to problems that often arise in the analytic treatment of patients with complicated chronic pain and fatigue as the primary complaints. Such approaches include respecting the mind-body split as a primary defense, speaking the language of the body along with the language of the mind and developing the verbal sphere around the non-verbal symptoms. The author emphasizes that complicated chronic pain problems are common and can be helped by psychoanalysis as long as the unique and complex features are understood and reflected in the technical approach.
