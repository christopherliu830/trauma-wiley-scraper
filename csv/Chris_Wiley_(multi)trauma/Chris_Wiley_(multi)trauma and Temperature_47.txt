AB  - Abstract Cytokines are a group of molecules with an extremely broad range of activities on a variety of target cells. This review summarizes the known cytokine and cytokine receptor expression in primary brain tumors and derived cell lines. These expression patterns are compared with those occurring in other CNS diseases, such as virus or bacterial infections, experimental allergic encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, and trauma. A variety of cytokines are expressed during CNS neoplasia; their potential involvement in tumor growth through a variety of mechanisms, such as autocrine or paracrine growth stimulation, angiogenesis, and immune surveillance evasion, are discussed. Finally, results of preliminary therapeutic approaches with cytokines are critically evaluated. ? 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Symptomatic acute adrenal insufficiency (adrenal crisis) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and should be managed as a medical emergency. Adrenal crisis is brought about by lack of production of the adrenal hormone cortisol and/or mineralocorticoids. It presents with marked symptoms and signs, characteristic laboratory abnormalities, and requires immediate treatment. The severity of this condition is related to the central role of these hormones in energy, salt, and fluid homeostasis. There are two forms of adrenal insufficiency: primary and secondary. Primary adrenal insufficiency (also termed Addison's disease), is caused by the inability of the adrenal cortex to produce sufficient amounts of glucocorticoids and/or mineralocorticoids (e.g., due to autoimmune-mediated destruction of adrenocortical tissue). Secondary adrenal insufficiency (also termed central hypoadrenalism) results when adrenal glucocorticoid production is deficient or absent because of corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]) deficiency. Chronic care of primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency is also briefly described; as this is an important opportunity to reduce future admissions, improve quality of life, and decrease morbidity.

AB  - Abstract Ardisiae Japonicae Herba is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of bronchitis conjunctivitis, pneumonia, and trauma. In this work, a high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry method was first established for the separation and structural identification of the chemical constituents in Ardisiae Japonicae Herba. A total of 15 compounds including coumarins, flavonoid glycosides, and catechins were identified or tentatively characterized based on their chromatographic behaviors and mass spectral fragmentation and by comparisons with the reference standards. Furthermore, a simple high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection method was developed for the simultaneous determination of five major constituents. Results obtained from method validation, including linearity, precision, repeatability, stability, and recovery, showed that the established method was reliable and accurate. Bergenin and quercitrin were found to be the most abundant constituents and could be served as chemical markers for quality control of Ardisiae Japonicae Herba.

AB  - Abstract In diabetes, the number of bone mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) decreases and their differentiation is impaired. However, the exact mechanism is unclear. Patients with diabetes often experience sympathetic nerve injury. Norepinephrine (NE), a major mediator of the sympathetic nervous system, influences rat MSC migration in culture and in vivo. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of NE on MSCs under high glucose conditions; therefore MSCs were treated with high glucose and NE. High glucose-induced MSCs apoptosis, which was reversed by NE. To verify the effect of NE, mice underwent sympathectomy and were used to establish a diabetic model. Diabetic mice with sympathectomy had a higher apoptosis rate and higher levels of reactive oxygen species in their bone marrow-derived cells than diabetic mice without sympathectomy. High glucose inhibited p-AKT production and B-Cell CLL/Lymphoma 2 expression, and promoted BAX and caspase-3 expression. NE reversed these effects of high glucose. An AKT inhibitor enhanced the effects of high glucose. Thus, NE had a protective effect on MSC apoptosis induced by high glucose, possibly via the AKT/BCL-2 pathway.

AB  - Abstract Man has used hallucinogenic plants and mushrooms for centuries. The characteristics of these plants that led to their incorporation into important ritualistic and spiritual traditions, however, have also resulted in their widespread propagation and abuse. Hallucinogenic plants have long been depicted as innocuous substances, yet their unpredictable nature makes intoxication potentially dangerous. In present-day society, there is greater access to these drugs and a growing trend among the younger generations to experiment with these plants in a recreational fashion. Emergency physicians need to be aware of the potential sources of plant hallucinogens and the spectrum of toxic effects. A review of the more common hallucinogenic plants and fungi is discussed with reference to historical, pharmacological and clinical aspects of these intoxications.

AB  - ABSTRACT The dental cementum covering the tooth root is similar to bone in several respects but remains poorly understood in terms of development and differentiation of cementoblasts, as well as the potential function(s) of cementocytes residing in the cellular cementum. It is not known if the cementocyte is a dynamic actor in cementum metabolism, comparable to the osteocyte in the bone. Cementocytes exhibit irregular spacing and lacunar shape, with fewer canalicular connections compared with osteocytes. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR (qPCR) revealed that the in vivo expression profile of cementocytes paralleled that of osteocytes, including expression of dentin matrix protein 1 (Dmp1/DMP1), Sost/sclerostin, E11/gp38/podoplanin, Tnfrsf11b (osteoprotegerin [OPG]), and Tnfsf11 (receptor activator of NF-?B ligand [RANKL]). We used the Immortomouse+/?; Dmp1-GFP+/? mice to isolate cementocytes as Dmp1-expressing cells followed by immortalization using the interferon (IFN)-?-inducible promoter driving expression of a thermolabile large T antigen to create the first immortalized line of cementocytes, IDG-CM6. This cell line reproduced the expression profile of cementocytes observed in vivo, including alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization. IDG-CM6 cells expressed higher levels of Tnfrsf11b and lower levels of Tnfsf11 compared with IDG-SW3 osteocytes, and under fluid flow shear stress, IDG-CM6 cells significantly increased OPG while decreasing RANKL, leading to a significantly increased OPG/RANKL ratio, which would inhibit osteoclast activation. These studies indicate similarities yet potentially important differences in the function of cementocytes compared with osteocytes and support cementocytes as mechanically responsive cells. ? 2015 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Abstract Background. Increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is detrimental for the recovery of organ function in trauma and emergency patients. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between the dynamics of IAP and organ dysfunction in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). Materials and methods. Management of SAP between 2000 and 2004 was analysed. SAP was classified according to Atlanta 1992. Organ dysfunction, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and outcomes in relation to the IAP were assessed. IAP was measured indirectly. Results. A total of 65 patients, with an average APACHE II score of 6.44, complied with the Atlanta criteria. In all, 34 patients received conservative treatment and 31 were operated. SIRS was observed in 59 cases and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in 61 cases. IAP was significantly higher in the 25 most complicated patients requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), compared with 40 patients without RRT, 31.72 vs 21.4 cm/H2O (p=0.037). IAP interrelated positively with SOFA score (r =+ 0.371, p<0.01) and organs involved (r =+ 0.356, p<0.01), and negatively with platelet count and enterally provided volume (r =? 0.284, p<0.01; r =? 0.5, p<0.01, respectively). Overall mortality (9.2%) was associated with surgery and sustained increase of the IAP over 25 cm/H2O. Our data support the pathophysiological interrelation of elevated IAP and development of organ dysfunction. Conclusion. Development of organ dysfunction in SAP could be associated with increased IAP. Grade III increase of IAP should be considered as an indicator for revision of treatment modalities.

AB  - Microglia are rapidly activated in the central nervous system (CNS) in response to a variety of injuries, including inflammation, trauma, and stroke. In addition to modulation of the innate immune response, a key function of microglia is the phagocytosis of dying cells and cellular debris, which can facilitate recovery. Despite emerging evidence that axonal debris can pose a barrier to regeneration of new axons in the CNS, little is known of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie clearance of degenerating CNS axons. We utilize a custom micropatterned microfluidic system that enables robust microglial-axon co-culture to explore the role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in microglial phagocytosis of degenerating axons. We find that pharmacologic and genetic disruption of TLR4 blocks induction of the Type-1 interferon response and inhibits phagocytosis of axon debris in vitro. Moreover, TLR4-dependent microglial clearance of unmyelinated axon debris facilitates axon outgrowth. In vivo, microglial phagocytosis of CNS axons undergoing Wallerian degeneration in a dorsal root axotomy model is impaired in adult mice in which TLR4 has been deleted. Since purinergic receptors can influence TLR4-mediated signaling, we also explored a role for the microglia P2 receptors and found that the P2X7R contributes to microglial clearance of degenerating axons. Overall, we identify TLR4 as a key player in axonal debris clearance by microglia, thus creating a more permissive environment for axonal outgrowth. Our findings have significant implications for the development of protective and regenerative strategies for the many inflammatory, traumatic, and neurodegenerative conditions characterized by CNS axon degeneration.

AB  - Hypoalbuminemia and decreased colloid osmotic pressure (COP) are common in critically ill dogs. Hypoalbuminemia has been shown to negatively impact outcome. Treatment strategies to raise COP include the use of both natural and synthetic colloids. To date there is no comprehensive evaluation of human albumin (HA) use in dogs. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the use of 25% HA in critically ill dogs. The medical records of all dogs receiving HA between January 2003 and March 2004 were reviewed using a standardized data sheet for signalment, diagnoses, Survival Prediction Index (SPI), dose of HA administered, amount of crystalloid fluid administered prior to HA administration, length of hospitalization (LOH), complications, and outcome. Additionally pre- and post-HA administration values for serum albumin (SA), blood COP, and total solids (TS) were evaluated. Thirty-seven dogs received HA. Thirty of the 37 dogs (81%) underwent surgery and 13 of 37 (39%) dogs were diagnosed with septic peritonitis. Other diagnoses included trauma, wounds, neoplasia, gastric ulcer, and pancreatitis. The median SPI of all dogs was 0.53 (range 0.06?0.82). Median dose of HA used was 1.5?g/kg (range 0.38?3.64?g/kg). Median dose of crystalloid fluids administered prior to HA administration was 6.23?ml/kg/hr (range 1.2?45.4?ml/kg/hr). Median LOH was 5 days (range 1?16 days). Mild complications were encountered in 9 of 37 (24%) dogs and included prolonged clotting times (n=3), increased breathing effort (n=3), vomiting (n=2), and fever (n=1). Of the 37 dogs in the study, 21 (57%) survived, 10 (27%) died, and 6 (16%) were euthanized. After HA administration, median SA increased from 1.5?g/dl (range 1.0?2.1?g/dl) to 2.8?g/dl (range 1.5?4.4?g/dl) (p<0.001), median COP increased from 11?mmHg (range 6.8?13.8?mmHg) to 14.4?mmHg (range 11?26.9?mmHg) (p<0.001), and median TS increased from 2.9?g/dl (range 0.9?4.6?g/dl) to 4.0 (range 2.8?6.2) (p<0.001). When compared to non-survivors, survivors had higher post-HA administration SA (p=0.008), higher net COP increase (p=0.032), and received higher dosages of HA (p=0.046). Pre-treatment SA, COP, or the development of complications during administration did not impact LOH or outcome. In this retrospective study, HA administration effectively increased SA, TS and COP in critically ill dogs and was associated with relatively few complications. Future studies are warranted to further evaluate the potential benefits of HA administration.

AB  - Comparison of the University of California (Los Angeles) shoulder scale and the simple shulder test with shoulder pain and disability index: Single-administration reliability and validity. (Texas Woman's University, Houston, TX) Phys Ther. 2000;80:759?768. This study compared 2 shoulder measures?the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) Shoulder Scale and the Simple Shoulder Test (SST)?with the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). One hundred ninety-two patients with shoulder disorders were recruited from one physician's office to complete the self-report sections of the 3 scales. Cronbach alpha values and standard errors of measurements (SEM) were calculated for each of the multi-item subscales. Validity was examined through calculation of correlation coefficients among the 3 scales. Factor analysis was completed to assess the underlying constructs of the SPADI and SST. Cronbach alpha values ranged from 0.85 to 0.95. The SEM values for the multi-item scales ranged from 4.75 to 11.65. Evidence for validity to reflect function was indicated by the correlation between the SST and the SPADI disability subscale. The factor analysis of the SPADI revealed loading on 1 factor, whereas the SST loaded on 2 factors. Conclude that all scales demonstrated good internal consistency, suggesting that all items for each scale measure the same constract. However, SEMS for all scales were high. Factor loading was consistent, suggesting that patients may not distinguish between pain and function. Comment by Philip S. Sizer Jr., MED, PT. Clinical practitioners are leaning toward evaluating functional status versus a pure-impairment-based approach to appraising shoulder limitations. Several scales have been developed for the evaluation of shoulder function, including the University of California Los Angeles Shoulder Scale (UCLA), the Simple Shoulder Test (SST), and the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). Investigations demonstrating the psychometric properties of these scales are limited in number. These investigators attempted to assess those properties, including internal consistency, reliability, and validity for all 3 scales. The analyses demonstrated internal consistency and construct homogeneity for the SPADI. However, all 3 scales demonstrated rather large standard errors of measure, which questions the reliability of the scales for measurement of an individual's progress. Regarding construct validity, the SPADI does not appear to distinguish between pain and dysfunction, disqualifying its use as a gold standard for comparison with other scales. While the SST purports to measure a single construct, the data suggests that it appears to measure 2 different constructs namely function and comfort. Additionally, the analyses appear to demonstrate that, while the scales may attempt to measure the same constructs, they apparently do not. Finally, the authors suggest that the precision of the UCLA scale is inferior to the other 2 scales and insufficient for following the progress of individual patients in the clinical setting.

AB  - Objective To evaluate C-reactive protein at presentation and during hospitalisation in dogs with acute kidney injury resulting from leptospirosis to compare C-reactive protein at presentation in dogs with acute kidney injury of different aetiology and to study its correlation with markers of inflammation, azotaemia and survival. Materials and Methods Prospective observational study of 41 dogs with acute kidney injury secondary to leptospirosis and 15 control dogs with acute kidney injury of different aetiology. C-reactive protein was measured at presentation in both groups and daily for 7 days in a subgroup of 28 dogs with leptospirosis. The associations of C-reactive protein with neutrophil count, albumin, urea, creatinine and survival were analysed. Results C-reactive protein was increased at presentation in all dogs with leptospirosis but was not significantly different from dogs with acute kidney injury of different cause. It was associated with markers of inflammation (neutrophil count, albumin) but not with azotaemia (creatinine, urea). It decreased gradually from presentation to day 4, with significantly lower concentrations in survivors than non-survivors. Initial C-reactive protein was only weakly associated with outcome, but its average concentration from presentation to day 2 was more strongly associated. Absolute and relative changes in C-reactive protein during hospitalisation and creatinine at presentation were not associated with survival. Clinical Significance Serial assessment of C-reactive protein may improve outcome prediction in dogs with leptospirosis compared with a single measurement at presentation or with markers of renal function.

AB  - Key points Partial sensory deprivation (deafferentation) by removing whiskers from the rat snout resulted in a reduced responsiveness of related cortical representations. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (three blocks of intermittent theta-burst) applied for 5 days in combination with sensory exploration restored the normal responsiveness level of the deafferented barrel cortex. However, intracortical inhibition (lateral and recurrent) appeared to be reduced after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, probably as the cause of improved responsiveness. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation also reduced the asymmetry of the lateral spread of sensory activity. Abstract Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) modulates human cortical excitability. It has the potential to support recovery to normal cortical function when the excitation?inhibition balance is altered (e.g. after a stroke or loss of sensory input). We tested cortical map plasticity on the basis of sensory responses (local field potentials, LFPs) and expression of neuronal activity marker proteins within the barrel cortex of rats receiving either active or sham rTMS after selective unilateral deafferentation by whiskers plucking. Rats received daily rTMS [intermittent theta-burst (iTBS), active or sham] for 5 days before exploring an enriched environment. Our previous studies indicated a disinhibitory effect of iTBS on cortical activity. Therefore, we also expected disinhibitory effects if deafferentation causes depression of sensory responses. Deafferentation resulted in an acute general reduction of sensory responsiveness and enhanced expression of inhibitory activity markers (GAD67, parvalbumin) in the deafferented hemisphere. Active but not sham-iTBS-rTMS normalized these measures. The stronger caudal-to-frontal horizontal spread of activity across barrels was reduced after deafferentation but not restored after active iTBS, despite generally increased responses. Fitting the LFP data with a computational model of different strengths and types of excitatory and inhibitory connections further revealed an iTBS-induced reduction of lateral and recurrent inhibition as the most probable scenario. Whether the disinhibitory effect of iTBS for the restoration of normal cortical function in the acute phase of depression after deafferentiation is also beneficial in humans remains to be demonstrated. As recently discussed, disinhibition appears to be required to open a window for neuronal plasticity.

AB  - The emergency department (ED) is at the front line of hospital pressure injury (PI) prevention, yet ED clinicians must balance many competing clinical priorities in the care of seriously ill patients. This paper presents the current biomechanical and clinical evidence and management considerations to assist EDs to continue to develop and implement evidence-based PI prevention protocols for the high-risk emergency/trauma patient. The prevention of hospital-acquired pressure injuries has received significant focus internationally over many years because of the additional burden that these injuries place on the patient, the additional costs and impact to the efficiency of the hospital, and the potential for litigation. The development of a PI is the result of a complex number of biomechanical, physiological, and environmental interactions. Our understanding of the interaction of these factors has improved significantly over the past 10 years. We have demonstrated that large reductions in PI incidence rates can be achieved in critical care and general hospital wards through the application of advanced evidence-based prevention protocols and believe that further improvement can be achieved through the application of these approaches in the ED.
