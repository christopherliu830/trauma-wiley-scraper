AB  - BACKGROUND: The characterization of microchimerism (MC) by gene amplification has been limited by few allogeneic markers, ascertainment bias, and assay analytic performance. To address this, a panel of 12 MC assays based on insertion-deletion (InDel) polymorphisms had been optimized. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The InDel assays were validated with comprehensive in vitro spiking studies at the stochastic limit of detection. Their ability was also determined to ascertain MC of unknown source genotype with both theoretical and actual donor-recipient pairs, and the assays were applied to a clinical population of 73 trauma patients who received transfusions where MC was previously characterized by HLA-based assays alone. RESULTS: In the stochastic spiking experiments, all assays were sensitive to a single copy of target DNA, and no false-positive amplification occurred among 1128 samples studied. Among 219 theoretical donor-recipient pairs, informative alleles existed for 99.5?percent with both InDel and HLA compared to 91.3?percent with HLA alone. In the clinical population, 33 cases of MC were detected (9 more cases than by HLA-DR alone) in the nonleukoreduced (non-LR) group and 8 cases (1 more case than by HLA-DR) in the LR group for the short-term follow-up. Among 27 long-term follow-up samples, 8 cases were detected overall (3 more cases than by HLA-DR alone). CONCLUSION: It is concluded that an InDel-based assay panel has excellent technical performance characteristics while also allowing for ascertainment of some MC cases not detectable with HLA alone. The tandem use of both the InDel and the HLA provides a powerful tool for the enhanced ascertainment of MC.

AB  - ? Premise of the study: The Olmos Formation was part of a system of deltas that existed in the southern portion of the Western Interior of North America during the Campanian-Maastrichtian. The paleofloristic composition from the northern portions of the Epicontinental Sea is relatively well known, but less intensive exploration in the south has precluded more detailed floristic comparison across the entire latitudinal span of the Sea. The Olmos Formation flora, with more than 100 different leaf morphotypes so far recognized and several wood types, has the most diverse Cretaceous fossil plant assemblage in Mexico and represents a valuable opportunity for comparative studies. ? Methods: The fossil woods here described were collected in the Coahuila State, Mexico. The samples were studied using standard thin section technique and identified by comparison with fossil and extant material. ? Key results: We described four new genera (Olmosoxylon, cf. Lauraceae; Coahuiloxylon, ?Anacardiaceae, ?Burseraceae; Muzquizoxylon, Cornaceae; and Wheeleroxylon, Malvaceae s.l.) and three xylotypes of angiosperms. ? Conclusions: Some of the genera present in the Olmos Formation such as Javelinoxylon and Metcalfeoxylon have been described from geologic units in the USA (San Juan Basin, New Mexico and Big Bend National Park, Texas), suggesting similarity in the taxonomic composition of the floras that inhabited southern portions of the western margin of the Campanian-Maastrichtian Epicontinental Sea. Other species, however, have only been reported for the Olmos Formation, indicating some degree of local floristic differentiation among the assemblages that inhabited the southern portion of the Western Interior.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the purpose, principle, specifications, and applications of electroencephalograph (EEG). EEG machines are used for diagnosing a variety of neurologic diseases, such as epilepsy, convulsive disorders, brain death, cerebrovascular lesions, ischaemia, and problems associated with trauma. The brain generates rhythmical potentials, which originate in the individual neurons of the brain. The EEG signals are of great diagnostic value both in terms of their amplitude and frequency. EEG signals picked up by the surface electrodes are usually small as compared with the electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Modern EEG monitors use computers to analyse and generate large amounts of electroencephalographic data, which are processed and displayed in various formats. EEG electrodes give high skin contact impedance as compared with ECG electrodes. EEG preamplifiers are generally designed to have a very high value of input impedance to take care of high electrode impedance.

AB  - Abstract Australia has a long and chequered history regarding relations between different cultural groups. Indigenous, Asian, Yugoslav, Italian and Arabic Australians have all suffered from negativity directed toward them by ?mainstream? Australia. At the beginning of the 21st century there has been much publicity about two groups: Indigenous Australians and asylum seekers. In this paper, we examine community attitudes toward these two groups, in particular the role of false beliefs in such attitudes. We then set out both the similarities and differences in these two highly related sets of attitudes, and conclude that Australia would appear not to be as accepting of a multi-cultural society as we sometimes believe, and on which we often pride ourselves. There are many social-psychological and structural issues related to negative attitudes toward Indigenous Australians and asylum seekers; much work needs to be carried out to address these.

AB  - Ticks are ectoparasites that cause dermatologic disease both directly through physical trauma to the skin, salivary secretions, or remnant body parts, and indirectly through transmission of disease. Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, and babesiosis are known tick-transmitted diseases. The histopathology related to a primary tick bite, similar to other arthropod bites, classically consists of a perivascular infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, neutrophils, histiocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils in varying amounts. We describe five patients with a novel histologic reaction to embedded tick parts., Each case demonstrates a thrombotic vasculopathy consisting of intraluminal eosinophilic deposits that stain strongly with Periodic acid Schiff stain. The adjacent tissue shows dermal necrosis with surrounding interstitial to diffuse dermal neutrophilic inflammation. We postulate that diffuse dermal nutrophilic infiltrates in association with thrombogenic vasculopathy is an unusual histologic picture of tick bite reactions that may be attributable to remnant tick parts.

AB  - Abstract We report a case of a profoundly hypothermic newborn with a core temperature of 25°C with a successful recovery and normal neurological outcome at 3 and 6 months. This term male infant had been exposed to a temperature of ?3°C for approximately 30 min. Slow re-warming, using external modalities was used in addition to volume expansion, heparinization, antibiotics and sedation. There is limited information available concerning the safest and most effective method of re-warming hypothermic newborns. Slow re-warming has been advocated as it replicates the normal physiological process in a neonate, which minimizes a negative therapy impact. Conclusion: The most significant decision regarding treatment is the identification of the most appropriate method and speed of re-warming. This report supports recommendations for gradual re-warming of a severely hypothermic newborn. Physiological cardiovascular mechanisms seemed to be intact during slow re-warming; this might be applicable to the treatment of profound hypothermia of the newborn.

PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract Complex regional pain syndrome I (CRPS I) is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) criteria to include pain that is disproportionate to the inciting event, sensory disturbances such as allodynia/ hyperalgesia, autonomic dysfunction, and motor dysfunction that usually occurs after trauma that is frequently trivial and generally expressed in an extremity. These symptoms are well described in the adult population, but there are relatively few data or reports of its prevalence in the pediatric population. Recent studies have demonstrated that unlike the adult population, about 90% of the cases reported are females in a range of 8 to 16 years, the youngest being 3 years old. There tends to be delay in recognizing the diagnosis, which may be as long as 4 months. In contrast to adults, the response to treatment, particularly exercise therapy with behavioral management will achieve almost 97% remission. While the pathophysiology is poorly understood, many features, particularly the neurologic abnormalities, suggest both peripheral and central nervous system involvement. Peripheral small fiber neuropathy as an etiology and inflammation involving small nerve fibers (neurogenic inflammatory pain) has been suggested. A tissue inflammatory etiology has been investigated over the past 25 years. However, these inflammatory aspects differ from those seen in other conditions involving tissue inflammation. The suggestion that CRPS in children is a different clinical entity than that seen in the adult, is probably incorrect, as recent evidence would suggest that the pathophysiology is most likely identical involving endocrine, behavioral, developmental, and environmental factors that distinguish clinical presentation in children from the adult. Behavioral management is a mandatory accompaniment of any program of exercise therapy and the sometimes extreme sensory disturbances and parental enmeshment do distinguish the clinical presentation from that in the adult. Interventional procedures may be required in the face of extreme allodynia preventing exercise therapy, and in occasional cases interruption of the sympathetic nerves may reverse this symptom in a few children. Occasionally, continuous analgesia techniques such as that which can be delivered by tunneled epidural catheter or an externalized neurostimulator (spinal cord stimulation) for short periods of time are effective.

AB  - Vessel strikes are the primary source of known mortality for the endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). Multi-institutional efforts to reduce mortality associated with vessel strikes include vessel-routing amendments such as the International Maritime Organization voluntary ?area to be avoided? (ATBA) in the Roseway Basin right whale feeding habitat on the southwestern Scotian Shelf. Though relative probabilities of lethal vessel strikes have been estimated and published, absolute probabilities remain unknown. We used a modeling approach to determine the regional effect of the ATBA, by estimating reductions in the expected number of lethal vessel strikes. This analysis differs from others in that it explicitly includes a spatiotemporal analysis of real-time transits of vessels through a population of simulated, swimming right whales. Combining automatic identification system (AIS) vessel navigation data and an observationally based whale movement model allowed us to determine the spatial and temporal intersection of vessels and whales, from which various probability estimates of lethal vessel strikes are derived. We estimate one lethal vessel strike every 0.775?2.07 years prior to ATBA implementation, consistent with and more constrained than previous estimates of every 2?16 years. Following implementation, a lethal vessel strike is expected every 41 years. When whale abundance is held constant across years, we estimate that voluntary vessel compliance with the ATBA results in an 82% reduction in the per capita rate of lethal strikes; very similar to a previously published estimate of 82% reduction in the relative risk of a lethal vessel strike. The models we developed can inform decision-making and policy design, based on their ability to provide absolute, population-corrected, time-varying estimates of lethal vessel strikes, and they are easily transported to other regions and situations.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Dermatophytosis is a contagious and zoonotic skin disease that spreads easily between individuals of the same species and across species. This paper describes its pathogenesis, with specific reference to the host and environmental factors, which predispose cats to infections. The clinical signs in cats can mimic almost any dermatological disease and include alopecia, scaling, comedones, erythema, hyperpigmentation, follicular casts, lichenification, miliary dermatitis and eosinophilic granuloma complex. Sample taking and the range of diagnostic tests available to confirm the diagnosis are described. The paper also highlights the need for the treatment of the in-contact pets and the environment, as well as the affected animal.

AB  - Objective Asian dust is a natural phenomenon in which dust particles are transported from desert areas in China and Mongolia to East Asia. Short-term exposure to Asian dust has been associated with cardiovascular disease through mechanisms such as systemic inflammation. Because inflammation is a potential trigger of placental abruption, exposure may also lead to abruption. We examined whether exposure to Asian dust was associated with abruption. Design A bi-directional, time-stratified case-crossover design. Setting and population From the Japan Perinatal Registry Network database, we identified 3014 patients who delivered singleton births in hospitals in nine Japanese prefectures from 2009 to 2014 with a diagnosis of placental abruption. Methods Asian dust levels were measured at Light Detection and Ranging monitoring stations, and these measurements were used to define the Asian dust days. As there was no information on the onset day of abruption, we assumed this day was the day before delivery (lag1). Main outcome measures Placental abruption. Results During the study period, the Asian dust days ranged from 15 to 71 days, depending on the prefecture. The adjusted odds ratio of placental abruption associated with exposure to Asian dust was 1.4 (95% confidence interval = 1.0, 2.0) for cumulative lags of 1?2 days. Even after adjustment for co-pollutant exposures, this association did not change substantially. Conclusions In this Japanese multi-area study, exposure to Asian dust was associated with an increased risk of placental abruption. Tweetable abstract Exposure to environmental factors such as Asian dust may be a trigger of placental abruption.

AB  - The autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays an important role in the human response to various internal and external stimuli, which can modify homeostasis, and exerts a tight control on essential functions such as circulation, respiration, thermoregulation and hormonal secretion. ANS dysfunction may complicate the perioperative course in the surgical patient undergoing anesthesia, increasing morbidity and mortality, and, therefore, it should be considered as an additional risk factor during pre-operative evaluation. Furthermore, ANS dysfunction may complicate the clinical course of critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units, in the case of trauma, sepsis, neurologic disorders and cardiovascular diseases, and its occurrence adversely affects the outcome. In the care of these patients, the assessment of autonomic function may provide useful information concerning pathophysiology, risk stratification, early prognosis prediction and treatment strategies. Given the role of ANS in the maintenance of systemic homeostasis, anesthesiologists and intensivists should recognize as critical the evaluation of ANS function. Measurement of heart rate variability (HRV) is an easily accessible window into autonomic activity. It is a low-cost, non-invasive and simple to perform method reflecting the balance of the ANS regulation of the heart rate and offers the opportunity to detect the presence of autonomic neuropathy complicating several illnesses. The present review provides anesthesiologists and intensivists with a comprehensive summary of the possible clinical implications of HRV measurements, suggesting that autonomic dysfunction testing could potentially represent a diagnostic and prognostic tool in the care of patients both in the perioperative setting as well as in the critical care arena.

AB  - Summary Ruminants and swine offer a unique set of challenges when undergoing general anesthesia. Pigs specifically have the propensity to be particularly challenging due to their reaction to handling and restraint, thick skin with limited venous access, and unique upper airway anatomy that can lead to potential difficult intubation. With proper planning and the right equipment, ruminants and swine can be safely and successfully anesthetized. This chapter focuses on the equipment essential to anesthetize these species and details species-specific recommendations.

AB  - Abstract Three adults with developmental disabilities and severe, chronic self-injurious behavior (SIB) were exposed in separate studies to multi-element functional analog experimental and control conditions. Participants' physiological status, primarily cardiac function, was recorded with a sophisticated computerized ambulatory monitoring garment (VivoMetrics? LifeShirt system). Results revealed a reliable and consistent heart rate (HR) pattern in all conditions, consisting of an escalating HR immediately before SIB occurrence, and quickly followed by a temporary drop in HR level occasioned by SIB action. This waveform was not an artifact of movement, HR level, respiration, posture, or SIB topography. This discovery suggests that the fundamental function of SIB is an escape from autonomic arousal. This function is consistent with other physiological and clinical findings. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
