AB  - Summary Background Synovial sepsis of unknown origin is a rare cause of lameness in the adult horse, and a haematogenous pathogenesis has been proposed in previous cases. Objectives To describe the features and outcome of synovial sepsis of unknown origin in adult Thoroughbred racehorses. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Hospital records for admissions between 2005 and 2015 were reviewed to identify adult horses diagnosed with synovial sepsis of unknown origin. Presentation, clinicopathological, microbiological and diagnostic imaging findings were recorded. Treatment methods, surgical findings, complications and long-term outcome were evaluated. Results Eleven cases were identified over the study period. Diagnosis was established from clinical examination and clinicopathologic findings, which were comparable to other aetiologies of synovial sepsis. Affected structures included synovial joints, tendon sheaths and bursae. Concurrent osteochondritis dissecans or articular cartilage lesions were evident during arthroscopic surgery in three cases. Significant intrasynovial haemorrhage was not identified. Microbial culture of synovial fluid or synovial biopsy was positive in 6/11 of cases, with all isolates being Gram-positive cocci. Of the 6 positive microbial cultures, all isolates demonstrated in vitro sensitivity to a cephalosporin antimicrobial agent. A concurrent remote wound was present in a single case. No other potential origins of bacteraemia were identified. Treatment methods included endoscopic surgery, standing multineedle lavage, intravenous regional limb perfusion, intrasynovial medication and/or systemic antimicrobial administration. All horses survived to hospital discharge. For the 6/11 cases that raced following synovial sepsis, the median period for return to racing was 221 days. Main limitations A small study population, which was retrospectively reviewed. Conclusions Synovial sepsis of unknown origin is rare in the adult Thoroughbred racehorse and can affect a range of synovial structures. A concurrent potential source of bacteraemia is rarely identified. With appropriate management, the prognosis to return to racing is fair.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe and compare characteristics and outcomes of patient presentations brought in by police (BIBP) with those not BIBP (NBIBP) to one Australian ED. Methods A retrospective observational study. All patient presentations to a tertiary hospital ED made during the period 8 October 2012 to 7 April 2013 were included. Routinely collected ED information data and medical record review data were used. ED care delivery for people BIBP from the watch house (WH) or other location was compared. Univariate comparison and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the different characteristics and ED outcomes between BIBP and NBIBP groups. Results A total of 35?127 ED presentations occurred within the 6 month period; 392 (1.1%) were BIBP. Compared with those NBIBP, those BIBP were diagnosed with ?psychiatric? and ?toxicology-related? illnesses in higher proportions. Overlap in health conditions (primarily for physical health reasons) between those BIBP and NBIBP existed. Presentations BIBP from the WH reflected ?physical health emergencies? whereas presentations BIBP from other locations reflected ?behavioural emergencies?. Compared to those NBIBP, those BIBP had a longer wait to be seen (by about 5 min), longer ED length of stay (LOS) if not admitted (by about 20?min) but shorter ED LOS if admitted (by about 59?min). When adjusted for sex, age group and diagnosis, ED LOS (if admitted) and admission rate were statistically significant. For those BIBP, mental health related orders and alcohol breath tests were common. Conclusions Patients BIBP were different to those NBIBP. Despite comprising a small proportion of overall ED attendances, they are a group where mental health and drug and alcohol issues are over-represented. Differences in ED care delivery for those BIBP highlights potential opportunities for pre-hospital healthcare interventions.

AB  - Objective Asian dust is a natural phenomenon in which dust particles are transported from desert areas in China and Mongolia to East Asia. Short-term exposure to Asian dust has been associated with cardiovascular disease through mechanisms such as systemic inflammation. Because inflammation is a potential trigger of placental abruption, exposure may also lead to abruption. We examined whether exposure to Asian dust was associated with abruption. Design A bi-directional, time-stratified case-crossover design. Setting and population From the Japan Perinatal Registry Network database, we identified 3014 patients who delivered singleton births in hospitals in nine Japanese prefectures from 2009 to 2014 with a diagnosis of placental abruption. Methods Asian dust levels were measured at Light Detection and Ranging monitoring stations, and these measurements were used to define the Asian dust days. As there was no information on the onset day of abruption, we assumed this day was the day before delivery (lag1). Main outcome measures Placental abruption. Results During the study period, the Asian dust days ranged from 15 to 71 days, depending on the prefecture. The adjusted odds ratio of placental abruption associated with exposure to Asian dust was 1.4 (95% confidence interval = 1.0, 2.0) for cumulative lags of 1?2 days. Even after adjustment for co-pollutant exposures, this association did not change substantially. Conclusions In this Japanese multi-area study, exposure to Asian dust was associated with an increased risk of placental abruption. Tweetable abstract Exposure to environmental factors such as Asian dust may be a trigger of placental abruption.

AB  - As baby boomers age, diabetes mellitus, cancer, osteoarthritis, cardiovascular diseases, and orthopedic disorders are more widespread and the demand for better biomedical devices and functional biomaterials is increasing rapidly. Owing to the good biocompatibility, chemical stability, catalytic efficiency, plasticity, mechanical properties, as well as strength-to-weight ratio, titanium dioxide (TiO2) based nanostructured materials are playing important roles in tissue reconstruction and diagnosis of these diseases. Here, recent advance in the research of nanostructured TiO2 based biomaterials pertaining to bone tissue engineering, intravascular stents, drug delivery systems, and biosensors is described.

Burn injury is a complex traumatic event with various local and systemic effects, affecting several organ systems beyond the skin. The pathophysiology of the burn patient shows the full spectrum of the complexity of inflammatory response reactions. In the acute phase, inflammation mechanism may have negative effects because of capillary leak, the propagation of inhalation injury and the development of multiple organ failure. Attempts to mediate these processes remain a central subject of burn care research. Conversely, inflammation is a necessary prologue and component in the later-stage processes of wound healing. In this review, we are attempting to present the current science of burn wound pathophysiology and wound healing. We also describe the evolution of innovative strategies for burn management.

AB  - Summary Dehydration and increased risk of respiratory problems are common outcomes of transport, and both appear to be related to journey duration, emotional effects, such as fear, and challenging environmental conditions. Welfare may be improved by familiarising equines with transport vehicles and loading procedures before travel starts, and by providing thermally comfortable and well ventilated conditions during the journey. For long road journeys, rest breaks with drinking water should be given. Both trained and unhandled animals should have sufficient space and freedom to adjust their posture and to lower their heads, but maximum safe space allowances are unknown. Mares and foals should be transported together. Injury during transport is relatively common, particularly in groups of horses travelling to slaughter, and is usually associated with driver error, internal fittings and vehicle type or design, but also with mixing of animals of different sex and weight leading to fighting. There needs to be better training and monitoring to prevent such avoidable risks to horse welfare. There is also a need for more research into appropriate prophylaxis and post transport therapy as knowledge of accumulated stress and depressed immune function following prolonged and repeated transport is poorly understood.

AB  - Abstract Advances in biomanufacturing techniques have opened the doors to recapitulate human sensory organs such as the nose and ear in vitro with adequate levels of functionality. Such advancements have enabled simultaneous targeting of two challenges in engineered sensory organs, especially the nose: i) mechanically robust reconstruction of the nasal cartilage with high precision and ii) replication of the nose functionality: odor perception. Hybrid nasal organs can be equipped with remarkable capabilities such as augmented olfactory perception. Herein, a proof-of-concept for an odor-perceptive nose-like hybrid, which is composed of a mechanically robust cartilage-like construct and a biocompatible biosensing platform, is proposed. Specifically, 3D cartilage-like tissue constructs are created by multi-material 3D bioprinting using mechanically tunable chondrocyte-laden bioinks. In addition, by optimizing the composition of stiff and soft bioinks in macro-scale printed constructs, the competence of this system in providing improved viability and recapitulation of chondrocyte cell behavior in mechanically robust 3D constructs is demonstrated. Furthermore, the engineered cartilage-like tissue construct is integrated with an electrochemical biosensing system to bring functional olfactory sensations toward multiple specific airway disease biomarkers, explosives, and toxins under biocompatible conditions. Proposed hybrid constructs can lay the groundwork for functional bionic interfaces and humanoid cyborgs.

AB  - Abstract ?Decoy? oligonucleotides can be used as gene-specific nuclear factor (NF-?B) inhibitors to regulate gene expression. We applied two different decoy oligonucleotides that contained the NF-?B binding consensus sequences present in the immunoglobulin G (IgG)-?B and Bcl-x promoter into 7-day-old (P7) rat lateral ventricles before hypoxia/ischemia (HI) and compared their effects on gene expression in hippocampi to saline-treated, scrambled decoy-treated, or untreated hippocampi exposed to HI. Left hippocampi were collected at 12 hr after HI. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) showed that the two decoy treatments had different effects on NF-?B binding to the IgG-?B and Bcl-x promoter-specific consensus sequences, respectively. We assessed the decoys' effects on gene expression 12 hr after HI using ribonuclease protection assays (RPAs) and Affymetrix DNA microarrays. RPAs showed that both decoys significantly decreased interleukin (IL)-1α mRNA levels but had no impact on IL-1?, IL-6, and IL-10 mRNA levels. IgG-?B decoys significantly decreased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and TNF-? mRNA levels compared to minimal changes after treatment with Bcl-x decoys. DNA microarray analyses showed that Bcl-x decoy treatment significantly decreased Bcl-xL mRNA levels. The decreased Bcl-xL mRNA levels after Bcl-x decoy treatment was confirmed by RPA analysis. DNA microarray data also indicated that several other genes were affected by both decoys. Our results suggest that different NF-?B decoy treatments could differentially regulate transcriptional responses to central nervous system trauma. Careful design of decoy sequences, however, is essential to acquire selective effects on cell death outcome. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Purpose To investigate the heating induced by (pseudo)-continuous arterial spin labeling ((p)CASL) sequences in vivo at 9.4T and to evaluate the benefit of a dedicated labeling coil. Methods Temperature was measured continuously in the brain, neck, and rectum of 9 rats with fiber-optic temperature probes while running pCASL-EPI and CASL-EPI sequences, with labeling B1 amplitudes (B1ave) of 3, 5, and 7 ?T and using a dedicated labeling RF coil or a volume coil. From the temperature time courses, the corresponding specific absorption rate (SAR) was computed. A trade-off between SAR and labeling quality was determined based on measured inversion efficiencies. Results ASL experiments with standard parameters (B1ave = 5 µT, Tacq = 4 min, labeling with volume coil) lead to a brain temperature increase due to RF of 0.72 ± 0.46 K for pCASL and 0.25 ± 0.17 K for CASL. Using a dedicated labeling coil reduced the RF-induced SAR by a factor of 10 in the brain and a factor of 2 in the neck. Besides SAR due to RF, heat from the coil decoupling circuits produced significant temperature increases. When labeling with a dedicated coil, this mechanism was the dominant source of brain heating. At equivalent RF-SAR, CASL provided slightly superior label efficiency to pCASL and is therefore the preferred sequence when an ASL coil is available. Conclusion B1ave = 4?5 µT provided a good compromise between label efficiency and SAR, both for pCASL and CASL. The sensitivity of animals to heating should be taken into account when optimizing preclinical ASL protocols and may require reducing scan duration or lowering B1ave.

Materials and Methods Prospective study of 30 dogs with recent generalised seizures and 30 healthy controls. Serum cardiac troponin I concentration was measured using two commercially available assays, and the correlation of clinical factors with concentration was examined. Results Serum concentrations of cardiac troponin I were higher in dogs that had recent seizures compared to controls when measured by both assays. The predictors most clearly associated with cardiac troponin I concentration were number of seizures and age. Both predictors were positively associated with increasing concentrations of troponin I. Clinical Significance Serum cardiac troponin I concentration was significantly elevated in dogs that had recent generalised seizures when compared to controls, and concentrations were higher in dogs that experienced more seizures. This association may indicate that generalised seizures are associated with damage to the myocardium.

This review will focus on the pathophysiology, management, and etiology of hypoglycemia in persons with and without diabetes. Hypoglycemia in persons with diabetes will focus on multiple factors including hypoglycemic unawareness, glucose monitoring, medication management, and comorbidities. Hypoglycemia in the non-diabetic individual can have multiple etiologies and poses a diagnostic challenge. It is important to respond quickly and appropriately to acute hypoglycemia in any individual. Although broad, the etiology of hypoglycemia must include a comprehensive and individualized review of medical, family, social, and pharmacologic patient histories.

AB  - Abstract Urinary bladder malfunction and disorders are caused by congenital diseases, trauma, inflammation, radiation, and nerve injuries. Loss of normal bladder function results in urinary tract infection, incontinence, renal failure, and end-stage renal dysfunction. In severe cases, bladder augmentation is required using segments of the gastrointestinal tract. However, use of gastrointestinal mucosa can result in complications such as electrolyte imbalance, stone formation, urinary tract infection, mucous production, and malignancy. Recent tissue engineering techniques use acellular grafts, cultured cells combined with biodegradable scaffolds, and cell sheets. These techniques are not all currently applicable for human bladder reconstruction. However, new avenues for bladder reconstruction maybe facilitated by a better understanding of urogenital development, the cellular and molecular biology of urothelium, and cell?cell interactions, which modulate tissue repair, homeostasis, and disease progression.

AB  - Summary At least 1 in 10 deaths in the older population are caused by infectious disease. The commonest infections are urinary tract infection, pneumonia and cellulitis. Susceptibility to infection increases due to changes in the immune system, exposure to pathogens in hospitals and care institutions, frailty and decreased physiological reserve. Infection often presents with a change in mental and functional status rather than typical signs of localised infection. Antibiotic stewardship is important in the older adult due to the risks of drug side effects and interactions, antibiotic resistance and Clostridium difficile infection. Particular features of this chapter include: Recognising atypical presentations of infection and sepsis in older people Investigations in the older person with a suspected urinary tract infection Differential diagnoses of cellulitis Indications to consider escalation of care

AB  - Abstract Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a widely used animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). EAE pathogenesis involves various cell types, cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Given the complexity of the inflammatory response in EAE, it is likely that many immune mediators still remain to be discovered. To identify novel immune mediators of EAE pathogenesis, we performed an Affymetrix gene array screen on the spinal cords of mice at the onset stage of disease. This screening identified the gene encoding lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) as being significantly upregulated. Lcn2 is a multi-functional protein that plays a role in glial activation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) stabilization, and cellular iron flux. As many of these processes have been implicated in EAE, we characterized the expression and role of Lcn2 in this disease in C57BL/6 mice. We show that Lcn2 is significantly upregulated in the spinal cord throughout EAE and is expressed predominantly by monocytes and reactive astrocytes. The Lcn2 receptor, 24p3R, is also expressed on monocytes, macrophages/microglia, and astrocytes in EAE. In addition, we show that EAE severity is increased in Lcn2?/? mice as compared with wild-type controls. Finally, we demonstrate that elevated levels of Lcn2 are detected in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in MS and in immune cells in CNS lesions in MS tissue sections. These data indicate that Lcn2 is a modulator of EAE pathogenesis and suggest that it may also play a role in MS. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background Childhood risk factors are associated with elevated inflammatory biomarkers in adulthood, but it is unknown whether these risk factors are associated with increased adult levels of the chronic inflammation marker soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR). We aimed to test the hypothesis that childhood exposure to risk factors for adult disease is associated with elevated suPAR in adulthood and to compare suPAR with the oft-reported inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP). Methods Prospective study of a population-representative 1972?1973 birth cohort; the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study observed participants to age 38 years. Main childhood predictors were poor health, socioeconomic disadvantage, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), low IQ, and poor self-control. Main adult outcomes were adulthood inflammation measured as suPAR and high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP). Results Participants with available plasma samples at age 38 were included (N = 837, 50.5% male). suPAR (mean 2.40 ng/ml; SD 0.91) was positively correlated with hsCRP (r 0.15, p < .001). After controlling for sex, body mass index (BMI), and smoking, children who experienced more ACEs, lower IQ, or had poorer self-control showed elevated adult suPAR. When the five childhood risks were aggregated into a Cumulative Childhood Risk index, and controlling for sex, BMI, and smoking, Cumulative Childhood Risk was associated with higher suPAR (b 0.10; SE 0.03; p = .002). Cumulative Childhood Risk predicted elevated suPAR, after controlling for hsCRP (b 0.18; SE 0.03; p < .001). Conclusions Exposure to more childhood risk factors was associated with higher suPAR levels, independent of CRP. suPAR is a useful addition to studies connecting childhood risk to adult inflammatory burden.

AB  - Abstract Impaired neutrophil functions, and in particular their antibacterial activity, are known to reflect the immunocompromised condition of the host. To investigate the potential for prompt on-site measurement of this condition, we analysed the antibacterial activity of murine neutrophils by measuring the change in oxygen consumption in a 10 ?l sample solution in which bacteria and neutrophils were co-incubated. A critical point was the use of freeze-dried Escherichia coli (E. coli), which remarkably facilitated handling because of its ability to be stored at room temperature for extended periods and the ease in which its respiratory activity could be re-established. This therefore allowed the antibacterial activity of murine neutrophils to be measured following their co-incubation with E. coli. Indeed, we successfully detected a reduction in the antibacterial activity of murine neutrophils in mice subjected to water-immersion restraint stress.

AB  - Objectives To describe the biochemical changes ? also known as the storage lesion ? that occur in canine packed red blood cells during ex vivo storage. Materials and Methods Ten 125-mL units of non-leuco-reduced packed red blood cells in citrate phosphate dextrose adenine were obtained from a commercial blood bank within 24 hours of donation. Samples were aseptically collected on days 1, 4, 7, 14, 28, 35 and 42 for measurement of sodium, potassium, chloride, lactate, glucose, pH and ammonia concentrations. All units were cultured on day 42. Friedman's repeated measures test with Dunn's multiple comparison test was used for non-parametric data. A repeated-measures analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparison test was used for parametric data. Alpha was set to 0·05. Results All analytes changed significantly during storage. The mean ammonia on day 1 (58·14 g/dL) was significantly lower (P<0·05) than those on days 28 (1266 g/dL), 35 (1668 g/dL) and 42 (1860 g/dL). A significant increase in median lactate concentration over time was also observed, with day 1 (4·385 mmol/L) being significantly less (P<0·05) than days 14 (19·82 mmol/L), 21 (22·81 mmol/L), 35 (20·31 mmol/L) and 42 (20·81 mmol/L). Median pH was significantly decreased after day 7. All bacterial cultures were negative. Clinical Significance Many biochemical alterations occur in stored canine packed red blood cells, although further studies are required to determine their clinical importance.
