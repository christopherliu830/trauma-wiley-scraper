AB  - Summary This chapter reviews evidence-based guidelines supporting specific injury identification and management. Trauma is the leading cause of death for persons less than 44 years of age and the fifth leading cause for all ages. Injury results from a transfer of energy to the body tissues. Standardized, sequential evaluations of the trauma patient are the best methods to identify injuries. Caring for trauma patients is not just about knowing how to deal with the injuries, but being able to anticipate and prevent complications. Patients are at risk for some complications simply due to pain and immobility. In trauma patients, pain control is extremely important to avoid complications associated with immobility and hypoventilation. All trauma patients are at risk for bowel complications. All patients can benefit from a bowel protocol and timely nutrition.

AB  - Identifying and characterizing top predators? use of trophic resources provides important information about animal ecology and their response to changing conditions. Information from sources such as stable isotopes can be used to infer changes in resource use as direct observations in the wild are difficult to obtain, particularly in the marine environment. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values were recovered from the canine teeth of grey seals collected from haul outs in the central North Sea in the 1970/1980s (n = 44) and 2000s (n = 25), spanning a period of marked ecosystem changes in the region. Extracting material deposited during juvenile and adult life-stages, we reconstructed a multi-decadal record of δ15N and δ13C variation. Using established correlations between stable isotope ratios and sea bottom temperature we created a proxy for baseline isotopic variability to account for this source of temporal change. We found 1) a significant long-term decline in juvenile grey seal δ15N values, suggesting trophic position has decreased over time; 2) a decline in adult δ15N values and contraction in stable isotopic niche space after the North Sea regime shift, signifying both a decline in trophic position and change in foraging habits over the 20th century; and 3) evidence for dietary segregation between juvenile and adult animals, showing juvenile individuals feeding at a lower trophic position and in more nearshore areas than adults. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of mining archived biological samples to address ecological questions and imply important ontogenetic and long-term shifts in the feeding ecology of a top predator. Long-term changes in grey seal trophic dynamics may be partly in response to well documented ecosystem changes in the North Sea. Such indirect monitoring of marine predators may have utility when set in the context of ecosystem assessments where paucity of long-term monitoring data is prevalent.

AB  - Abstract:? Anthropological examination of defleshed bones is the gold standard for osteological measurement in forensic practice. However, multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) offers the opportunity of three-dimensional imaging of skeletal elements, allowing measurement of bones in any plane without defleshing. We present our experiences of the examination of 15 human lower limbs in different states of decomposition using MDCT. We present our method of imaging and radiological measurement of the bones including sex assessment. The radiological measurements were undertaken by three professional groups?anthropology, radiology, and forensic pathology?both at the site of scanning and at a remote site. The results were compared to anthropological oestological assessment of the defleshed bones. We discuss the limitations of this technique and the potential applications of our observations. We introduce the concept of remote radiological anthropological measurement of bones, so-called tele-anthro-radiology and the role that this could play in providing the facility for standardization of protocols, international peer review and quality assurance schemes.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To determine the population of patients where patient transfer may be prevented by assessment of a senior ED registrar at the referring hospital. Methods Patients transferred from Caulfield Hospital, specialising in community services, rehabilitation, aged care and aged mental health to The Alfred Emergency and Trauma Centre, an adult major referral centre within the same clinical network were identified from 1 July 2016 to 31 December 2016. Medical records were reviewed independently by two clinicians to determine preventability of transfer and whether attendance by a senior ED registrar could have prevented the transfer. Results There were 221 patients included with a mean age of 73.6(15.1) years. The median time spent in the ED was 4 h (interquartile range 2?8) and 197 (89.1%) were admitted. There were 107 (48.6%) transfers deemed preventable or potentially preventable, with 104 preventable by attendance of a senior ED registrar. The most common indication for transfer was acute trauma (n =?55; 24.9%), and the odds of a case being preventable or potentially preventable if transferred for the primary indication of trauma was 3.9 (95% confidence interval 2.1?7.1; P < 0.001). Among the preventable cases, the total cost of transfer was AU$105?984 over 6 months, not accounting for the costs of duplication of care. Conclusions This proof-of-concept study suggests that strategies to expand the provision of acute care to outreach within specialist networks and reduce patient transfers should be further explored. An outreach programme for improved acute assessment of patients at the referring hospital particularly after acute trauma may prevent transfers, improving care pathways.

AB  - Abstract Objective Blood pressure (BP) cuffs are potential vectors for transmission of multi-resistant organisms (MROs). The present study aims to determine MRO colonisation rates in BP cuffs from areas of high patient flow as an assessment of the quality of disinfection and infection control practices. Methods BP cuffs in the ED, high dependency unit (HDU) and operating theatres (OT) were prospectively examined after routine disinfection procedures. Swabs collected from the inner and outer surfaces of BP cuffs during inter-patient intervals were plated onto replicate organism detection and counting, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) chromogenic agar plates to detect rates of bacterial, MRSA and VRE colonisation, respectively. Results High bacterial colonisation rates were detected in BP cuffs from all three areas. BP cuffs from OT were significantly less colonised compared with cuffs from HDU and ED; 76% versus 96% and 100% (P < 0.0001) for inner surfaces and 86% versus 98% and 100% (P < 0.0001) for outer surfaces, respectively. Equivalent or higher bacterial growth was observed on the inner surface compared with outer surface in 54%, 84% and 86% of BP cuffs from OT, HDU and ED, respectively. MRSA was detected in 3 of 150 (2%) swabs collected, but no VRE was detected. Conclusion Although MRSA and VRE were infrequently isolated, current disinfection and infection control protocols need to be improved given the greater recovery of organisms from the inner compared with outer surfaces of BP cuffs.

AB  - Abstract Objective To review the relevant human and veterinary literature regarding the timing of surgical intervention for trauma patients and the impact on outcome. Data Sources Original research, clinical studies, and review articles with no date restrictions from both human and veterinary literature. Human Data Synthesis Despite extensive research into the ideal timing of surgical intervention for human trauma victims, debate is ongoing and views are still evolving. Prior to the 1970s, the standard of care consisted of delayed surgical treatment, as these patients were considered too ill to undergo surgery. Beginning in the 1970s, and continuing for nearly 2 decades, early definitive surgical treatment was recommended. The most recent evolution of human trauma management incorporates the concept of damage control surgery, which acknowledges the importance of early skeletal stabilization or laparotomy for reducing morbidity while attempting to avoid complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Veterinary Data Synthesis Despite a relatively large amount of literature available regarding veterinary trauma, no evidence exists to provide the clinician guidance as to the ideal timing of surgery for trauma patients. With the exception of diaphragmatic hernia, no studies were identified that attempted to evaluate this variable. Conclusions Veterinary-specific studies are needed to evaluate the impact of surgical timing on outcome following trauma. The information that can be obtained from studies in this area can improve veterinary trauma care and may be used as models for human trauma care through translational applications.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There is no current evidence on how mild and critical cases of colic can be differentiated at primary examination. Previous research has focused on clinical variables assessed post referral. Objectives To identify features of the primary clinical presentation which differentiate between a critical and mild-medical colic. Study design Prospective multi-centre cross-sectional study. Methods Paper-based and online questionnaires were distributed to 850 practices which treat horses, to collect data on the primary presentation of colic cases over 13 months. Critical cases were defined as horses which died, were subjected to euthanasia, had surgery, or required intensive care. Mild-medical cases were defined as those resolving with medical treatment on a single visit. Descriptive analysis was used to evaluate the data. Univariable analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U tests and Chi-squared tests to assess the degree of association between clinical variables and the dependant variables ?critical? and ?mild-medical?. Results 161 veterinarians submitted 1048 colic case forms; 240 critical cases and 535 mild-medical cases were identified. There was evidence of difference (P<0.000) for cardiovascular variables (heart and respiratory rates, capillary refill time, and mucous membrane colour), signs of pain and abdominal borborygmi between mild-medical and critical cases. Critical cases had a higher mean heart rate (60 beats/min [range 21?125]) than mild-medical cases (42 beats/min [range 18?120]). The median total abdominal borborygmi score was lower at 3 (range 0?12) for critical, compared with 7 (range 0?12) for mild-medical cases. The use of diagnostic tests were significantly different (P<0.0001), with more tests performed in critical cases. Rectal examination and nasogastric intubation were not performed in 17.5% and 52.6% of critical cases, respectively. Conclusions There were significant differences in the primary presentation of critical and mild-medical colic cases. Veterinary surgeons? diagnostic approach varied between cases.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Digital ulcers (DUs) are a major cause of disease-related morbidity and difficult to treat vascular complication of systemic sclerosis (SSc). Demonstrating treatment efficacy has traditionally focussed upon clinician assessment of DUs alone. No existing patient reported outcome (PRO) instrument captures the multi-faceted impact of SSc-DU. We report the findings of a multi-centre qualitative research study exploring the patient experience of SSc-DU. Methods Patient focus groups (FGs) were conducted across 3 scleroderma units, following a topic guide devised by SSc patients, experts and experienced qualitative researchers. A purposive sampling framework ensured the experiences of a diverse group of patients were captured. FGs were audio recorded, transcribed, anonymised, and analysed using inductive thematic analysis. We continued FGs until thematic saturation was achieved. Results Twenty-nine SSc patients with a history of DU disease participated in 4 FGs across the UK (Bath, Manchester and London). Five major inter-related themes (and sub-themes) were identified which encompass the patient experience of SSc-DUs: ?Disabling pain and hypersensitivity?, ?Deep and broad-ranging emotional impact?, ?Impairment of physical and social activity?, ?Factors aggravating occurrence, duration and impact? and ?Mitigating, managing and adapting?. Conclusion The patient experience of SSc-DU is multi-faceted and comprises a complex interplay of experiences associated with significant pain and morbidity. Patient experiences of SSc-DU are not captured using existing SSc-DU outcomes. Our findings shall inform the development of a novel PRO instrument to assess the severity and impact of SSc-DUs for use in future SSc-DU clinical trials.

AB  - Abstract Silver-containing wound dressings are an integral part of wound therapy in adult and pediatric burn patients. The antimicrobial effect of silver is well known and has been described in numerous studies. Side effects are rarely reported from silver-containing wound care products, even though systemic absorption of silver has been shown by elevated levels of silver in the blood of patients after silver exposure during wound therapy. This animal study investigated the silver levels of blood and in which organs and tissues silver is detectable after long-term application of silver-containing wound dressings after a burn trauma. In male rats, a major full-thickness scald was created on their backs according to a standardized burn model. Two different silver-containing wound dressings (nanocrystalline silver [NCS] and silver sulphate foam [SSF]) were applied initially and changed every 7 days. Weekly blood drawings revealed an increase of blood silver in week three with significant higher values in the SSF compared with NCS group (Ag ?g/kg 135.8 vs. 61.7; means; p?≤?0.05). Thereafter, the NCS group showed significantly higher blood silver levels than the SSF group at week five (Ag ?g/kg 192.3 vs. 81.3; means; p?≤?0.01) and six (Ag ?g/kg 168.2 vs. 32.9; means; p?≤?0.01). After 6 weeks, the animals were sacrificed, and the organs and tissues were analyzed for their silver content by inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry. Silver was detectable in all analyzed organs and tissue samples, with higher silver values in parenchymatous organs in the NCS than SSF group (Ag ?g/kg; spleen: 3,469 vs. 260; kidney: 3,186 vs. 289; liver: 2,022 vs. 313; means; p?≤?0.05). Silver was also detectable in brain, testis, lung, heart, and muscle tissue.

AB  - Summary Background Salmonella enterica is an important cause of healthcare-associated infections in veterinary hospitals ? with outbreaks of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Salmonella among equine cases resulting in high case fatality rates and substantial financial cost. Objectives Study objectives were to 1) investigate factors associated with shedding of MDR-Salmonella enterica and 2) evaluate the effect shedding may have on health outcomes of previously hospitalised horses and their stablemates. Study design Retrospective case?control study with prospective cohort study. Methods Analysis of medical records (N = 373; 94 culture positive, 279 culture negative) was undertaken to determine factors associated with shedding of MDR-Salmonella. Additionally, a follow-up study was conducted to assess long-term outcomes associated with shedding among previously hospitalised horses and their stablemates. Data regarding exposures of interest were collected retrospectively from medical records. Information on long-term outcomes was obtained by phone interview of owners. Multivariable regression techniques were used to investigate factors associated with shedding and subsequent health outcomes. Results Horses experiencing diarrhoea during hospitalisation were more likely to shed Salmonella (OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.02, 3.45) compared with horses without diarrhoea, but isolates tended to be susceptible strains. Antimicrobial therapy during hospitalisation was not associated with shedding or recovery of MDR strains. Shedding did not increase long-term risk for non-survival, colic or abnormal faeces after hospital discharge; nor increase risk for hospitalisation or occurrence of abnormal faeces in stablemates. Main limitations Data collection was reliant upon the quality of medical records and owner recall, which may have led to information bias. The study population was derived from central Kentucky and may differ from horse populations in other regions. Conclusions and clinical importance In general, Salmonella shedding was not associated with decreased average survival times or impacts to health of stablemates, perhaps due to owner implemented biosecurity precautions. Regardless, recently hospitalised horses should be segregated after discharge, in addition to employing rigorous hygiene practices. The Summary is available in Spanish ? see Supporting Information.

AB  - Abstract We have previously shown that treatment with a mGluR5 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) is neuroprotective after experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI), limiting post-traumatic neuroinflammation by reducing pro-inflammatory microglial activation and promoting anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective responses. However, the specific molecular mechanisms governing this anti-inflammatory shift in microglia remain unknown. Here we show that the mGluR5 PAM, VU0360172 (VuPAM), regulates microglial inflammatory responses through activation of Akt, resulting in the inhibition of GSK-3?. GSK-3? regulates the phosphorylation of CREB, thereby controlling the expression of inflammation-related genes and microglial plasticity. The anti-inflammatory action of VuPAM in microglia is reversed by inhibiting Akt/GSK-3?/CREB signaling. Using a well-characterized TBI model and CX3CR1gfp/+ mice to visualize microglia in vivo, we demonstrate that VuPAM enhances Akt/GSK-3?/CREB signaling in the injured cortex, as well as anti-inflammatory microglial markers. Furthermore, in situ analysis revealed that GFP + microglia in the cortex of VuPAM-treated TBI mice co-express pCREB and the anti-inflammatory microglial phenotype marker YM1. Taken together, our data show that VuPAM decreases pro-inflammatory microglial activation by modulating Akt/GSK-3?/CREB signaling. These findings serve to clarify the potential neuroprotective mechanisms of mGluR5 PAM treatment after TBI, and suggest novel therapeutic targets for post-traumatic neuroinflammation.

AB  - Abstract The existence of interactions between sequential enzymes of metabolic pathways has been explored extensively throughout the field of biochemistry. These closely coupled pathways, termed metabolons, have been demonstrated to induce substrate channeling that results in increased efficiency by enhancing local substrate concentrations, protecting liable intermediates, and limiting distance between enzyme active sites. This phenomenon may have direct implication in the advancement of multi-enzyme enzymatic biofuel cells through the use of super-complex formations as bioanode catalysts. This will result in an efficient means of a more complete oxidation of a fuel, while optimizing the flux of the system through the recreation of a phenomenon that is conserved throughout biology.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background The efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia in adult patients with traumatic brain injury is not fully understood. The historical use of therapeutic hypothermia at extreme temperatures was associated with severe complications and led to it being discredited. Positive results from animal studies using milder temperatures led to renewed interest. However, recent studies have not convincingly demonstrated the beneficial effects of therapeutic hypothermia in practice. Aim This review aims to answer the question: in adults with a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), does the use of therapeutic hypothermia compared with normothermia affect neurological outcome? Design Systematic review. Method Four major electronic databases were searched, and a hand search was undertaken using selected key search terms. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. The studies were appraised using a systematic approach, and four themes addressing the research question were identified and critically evaluated. Results A total of eight peer-reviewed studies were found, and the results show there is some evidence that therapeutic hypothermia may be effective in improving neurological outcome in adult patients with traumatic brain injury. However, the majority of the trials report conflicting results. Therapeutic hypothermia is reported to be effective at lowering intracranial pressure; however, its efficacy in improving neurological outcome is not fully demonstrated. This review suggests that therapeutic hypothermia had increased benefits in patients with haematoma-type injuries as opposed to those with diffuse injury and contusions. It also suggests that cooling should recommence if rebound intracranial hypertension is observed. Conclusion Although the data indicates a trend towards better neurological outcome and reduced mortality rates, higher quality multi-centred randomized controlled trials are required before therapeutic hypothermia is implemented as a standard adjuvant therapy for treating traumatic brain injury. Relevance to clinical practice Therapeutic hypothermia can have a positive impact on patient outcome, but more research is required.

AB  - Background Members of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex cause severe outbreaks in humans, and are increasingly reported in animals. Objective and Methods A retrospective study, describing a severe outbreak in dogs and cats caused by a multidrug resistant member of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex in a veterinary hospital, between July 2010 and November 2012. Results The study included 19 dogs and 4 cats. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex bacteria were isolated from urine (9 animals), respiratory tract (11), tissues (3) and blood (1). The most common infection-associated findings included fever, purulent discharge from endotracheal tubes, hypotension, and neutropaenia. Infections led to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis and sepsis. Infection was transmitted in the intensive care unit, where 22 of 23 animals were initially hospitalised. The mortality rate was 70% (16 of 23 animals), and was higher in cases of respiratory infection compared to other infections. Aggressive environmental cleaning and disinfection, with staff education for personal hygiene and antisepsis, sharply decreased the infection incidence. Clinical Significance Health care-associated outbreaks with multidrug resistant Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex in dogs and cats are potentially highly fatal and difficult to eradicate, warranting monitoring, antiseptic techniques and judicious antibiotic use.

AB  - Abstract Background: Hypothermia is commonly used for organ and tissue preservation in multiple clinical settings, but its role in the management of injured patients remains controversial. There is no doubt that temperature modulation is a powerful tool, and hypothermia has been shown to protect cells during ischaemia and reperfusion, decrease organ damage and improve survival. Yet hypothermia is a double-edged sword: unless carefully managed, its induction can be associated with a number of complications. Methods: A literature review was performed to include important papers that address the impact of hypothermia on key biological processes, and explore the potential therapeutic role of hypothermia in trauma/haemorrhage models. Results: No clinical studies have been conducted to test the therapeutic benefits of hypothermia in injured patients. However, numerous well designed animal studies support this concept. Despite excellent preclinical data, there are several potential barriers to translating hypothermia into clinical practice. Conclusion: Therapeutic hypothermia is a promising life-saving strategy. Appropriate patient selection requires a thorough understanding of how temperature modulation affects various biological mechanisms. Copyright ? 2011 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd.

AB  - Summary Neurological insults are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, both in adults and especially in children. Among possible therapeutic strategies to limit clinical cerebral damage and improve outcomes, hypothermia remains a promising and beneficial approach. However, its advantages are still debated after decades of use. Studies in adults have generated conflicting results, whereas in children recent data even suggest that hypothermia may be detrimental. Is it because brain temperature physiology is not well understood and/or not applied properly, that hypothermia fails to convince clinicians of its potential benefits? Or is it because hypothermia is not, as believed, the optimal strategy to improve outcome in patients affected with an acute neurological insult? This review article should help to explain the fundamental physiological principles of brain heat production, distribution and elimination under normal conditions and discuss why hypothermia cannot yet be recommended routinely in the management of children affected with various neurological insults.

AB  - Abstract Background Purulent pericarditis is an acute and fulminant disease characterized by pus accumulation in the pericardial space. Its incidence has declined substantially and the common pathogen has changed since the beginning of the antibiotic era; however, it is still found in some patients with immunocompromised conditions. Case report We report a rare case in which the onset of diabetes mellitus presented as extremely high HbA1c concentration, ketoacidosis, multi-site abscesses and purulent pericarditis. After antibiotic therapy and pericardiocentesis, the purulent pericarditis still did not resolve and further intrapericardial thrombolytic therapy also failed. Finally, this patient was treated successfully by surgical debridement and pericardiectomy. Conclusion In the immunocompromised state of severe hyperglycaemia, purulent pericarditis is a possible complication of uncontrolled infection. If purulent pericarditis cannot be cured using non-surgical treatments, such as antibiotic therapy, pericardiocentesis and intrapericardial thrombolytic therapy, a surgical pericardiectomy should be considered to avoid morbidity and mortality.

AB  - After major trauma, the human immune system initiates a series of inflammatory events at the injury site that is later followed by suppression of local inflammation favoring the repair and remodeling of the damaged tissues. This local immune response involves complex interactions between resident cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, soluble mediators such as cytokines and chemokines, and recruited cells such as neutrophils, monocytes and mesenchymal stromal cells. If of sufficient magnitude, these initial immune responses nevertheless have systemic consequences resulting in a state called post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI). However, controversy exists regarding the exact immunological changes occurring in systemic compartments triggered by these local immune responses. PTI is one of the leading causes of post-surgical mortality and makes patients vulnerable to hospital-acquired infections, multiple organ failure and many other complications. In addition, hemorrhage, blood transfusion, immunesenescence and immunosuppressant drugs aggravate PTI. PTI has been intensively studied, but published results are frequently cloudy. The purpose of this review is to focus on the contributions made by different responsive modalities to immunosuppression following sterile trauma and to try to integrate these into an overall scheme of PTI.
