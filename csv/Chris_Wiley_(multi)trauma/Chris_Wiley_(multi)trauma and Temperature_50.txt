AB  - ABSTRACT Usage of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in the management of acute and chronic wounds has grown exponentially in the past decade. Hundreds of studies have been published regarding outcomes and methods of therapy used for adult wounds. This treatment is increasingly being used to manage difficult-to-treat paediatric wounds arising from congenital defects, trauma, infection, tumour, burns, pressure ulceration and postsurgical complications in children, although relatively few studies have been aimed at this population. Given the anatomical and physiological differences between adults and children, a multidisciplinary expert advisory panel was convened to determine appropriate use of NPWT with reticulated open cell foam (NPWT/ROCF) as delivered by Vacuum Assisted Closure? (V.A.C.? Therapy, KCI Licensing, Inc., San Antonio, TX) for the treatment of paediatric wounds. The primary objectives of the expert advisory panel were to exchange state-of-practice information on paediatric wound care, review the published data regarding the use of NPWT/ROCF in paediatric wounds, evaluate the strength of the existing data and establish guidelines on best practices with NPWT/ROCF for the paediatric population. The proposed paediatrics-specific clinical practice guidelines are meant to provide practitioners an evidence base from which decisions could be made regarding the safe and efficacious selection of pressure settings, foam type, dressing change frequency and use of interposing contact layer selections. The guidelines reflect the state of knowledge on effective and appropriate wound care at the time of publication. They are the result of consensus reached by expert advisory panel members based on their individual clinical and published experiences related to the use of NPWT/ROCF in treating paediatric wounds. Best practices are described herein for novice and advanced users of NPWT/ROCF. Recommendations by the expert panel may not be appropriate for use in all circumstances. Decisions to adopt any particular recommendation must be made by the collaborating medical team, including the surgeon and wound care specialist based on available resources, individual patient circumstances and experience with the V.A.C.? Therapy System.

AB  - Abstract Mycotic keratitis (an infection of the cornea) is an important ocular infection, especially in young male outdoor workers. There are two frequent presentations: keratitis due to filamentous fungi (Fusarium, Aspergillus, phaeohyphomycetes and Scedosporium apiospermum are frequent causes) and keratitis due to yeast-like fungi (Candida albicans and other Candida species). In the former, trauma is usually the sole predisposing factor, although previous use of corticosteroids and contact lens wear are gaining importance as risk factors; in the latter, there is usually some systemic or local (ocular) defect. The clinical presentation and clinical features may suggest a diagnosis of mycotic keratitis; increasingly, in vivo (non-invasive) imaging techniques (confocal microscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography) are also being used for diagnosis. However, microbiological investigations, particularly direct microscopic examination and culture of corneal scrape or biopsy material, still form the cornerstone of diagnosis. In recent years, the PCR has gained prominence as a diagnostic aid for mycotic keratitis, being used to complement microbiological methods; more importantly, this molecular method permits rapid specific identification of the aetiological agent. Although various antifungal compounds have been used for therapy, management of this condition (particularly if deep lesions occur) continues to be problematic; topical natamycin and, increasingly, voriconazole (given by various routes) are key therapeutic agents. Therapeutic surgery, such as therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty, is needed when medical therapy fails. Increased awareness of the importance of this condition is likely to spur future research initiatives.

AB  - Abstract Several focal skeletal muscle diseases, including tumours and trauma lead to a limited loss of functional muscle tissue. There is still no suitable clinical approach for treating such defects. A promising approach could be the tissue engineering of skeletal muscle. However, a clinically reliable differentiation stimulus for three-dimensional (3-D) cultures is necessary for this process, and this condition has not yet been established. In order to qunantify and analyze the differentiation potential of electrical cell stimulation, primary myoblasts were stimulated within a 3-D fibrin-matrix. Gene expression of MyoD, myogenin and AChR were measured by real-time RT-PCR over a time period of eight days, showing immediate down-regulation of all marker genes. For tissue engineering approaches, cell multiplication is crucial for acquisition of sufficient tissue volumes for reconstruction. Therefore, all experiments were performed with high and low passaged myoblasts, demonstrating higher transcript rates of marker genes in lowpassage cells. Our findings strongly suggest a reconsideration of electrical stimulation in muscle tissue engineering.

AB  - Aims Urethral stricture (US) formation is caused by fibrosis after excessive collagen formation following an injury or trauma to the urethra. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on a urethral injury (UI) model of male rats. Methods A UI model was used by applying a coagulation current to the urethras of male rats. There were four groups with six rats in each: control group, PRP applied to naive urethra, UI group, and UI with PRP application. PRP was applied to the urethra after a coagulation current-induced injury as soon as possible. On the 14th day, all rats were sacrificed and urethral tissues were investigated for collagen type I, collagen type III, platelet-derived growth factor-α, platelet-derived growth factor-?, and transforming growth factor-? using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. The effect of urethral damage and healing was evaluated for collagen type I-to-collagen type III ratio. Results The collagen type I-to-collagen type III ratio was significantly higher in UI group (P?<?0.05) than in the others, while UI with PRP application group had comparable results with the control group (P?>?0.05). Conclusions The results of this study show that PRP has a preventive effect on stricture formation in a UI model of rats, as shown by its effect on collagen synthesis. Further studies that eventually show the effects of PRP on human tissues are necessary and promising.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis Gene therapy offers the possibility of delivering corrective genetic materials to the cochlea, potentially improving hearing. In animals, the most commonly used surgical methods for viral gene therapy delivery to the cochlea are the round window and the cochleostomy approaches. However, the patterns of viral infection and the effects on hearing have not been directly compared between these two approaches. In this study, we compare the patterns of cochlear infection and effects on hearing between these two surgical approaches using adeno-associated virus serotype 2/8 (AAV8) as the gene delivery vehicle. Study Design Animal study and basic science research. Methods One- to two-month-old CBA/J mice were used in this study. AAV8-green fluorescent protein (GFP) was delivered to the cochlea by either the round window or the cochleostomy approach (described below). Auditory brainstem response was used to examine hearing thresholds before and after surgery. Animals were examined at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after surgery for the patterns of cochlear infection and hearing loss. Results Cochlear gene transfer was successful through both surgical approaches. In both approaches, AAV8-GFP mostly infected the inner hair cells. There was occasional low-level infection of the outer hair cells and supporting cells. The two surgical approaches resulted in comparable viral infection efficiencies. The round window approach resulted in less surgical trauma, as indicated by hearing loss, than the cochleostomy approach. Conclusions Adeno-associated virus-mediated gene transfer to the cochlea can be accomplished using either the round window or the cochleostomy surgical approach. The round window approach resulted in less hearing loss compared to the cochleostomy approach. Level of Evidence NA Laryngoscope, 125:2557?2564, 2015

AB  - Arctic environments, where surface temperatures increase and sea ice cover and permafrost depth decrease, are very sensitive to even slight climatic variations. Placing recent environmental change of the high-northern latitudes in a long-term context is, however, complicated by too short meteorological observations and too few proxy records. Driftwood may represent a unique cross-disciplinary archive at the interface of marine and terrestrial processes. Here, we introduce 1445 driftwood remains from coastal East Greenland and Svalbard. Macroscopy and microscopy were applied for wood anatomical classification; a multi-species subset was used for detecting fungi; and information on boreal vegetation patterns, circumpolar river systems, and ocean current dynamics was reviewed and evaluated. Four conifer (Pinus, Larix, Picea, and Abies) and three deciduous (Populus, Salix, and Betula) genera were differentiated. Species-specific identification also separated Pinus sylvestris and Pinus sibirica, which account for ~40% of all driftwood and predominantly originate from western and central Siberia. Larch and spruce from Siberia or North America represents ~26% and ~18% of all materials, respectively. Fungal colonization caused different levels of driftwood staining and/or decay. Our results demonstrate the importance of combining wood anatomical knowledge with insight on boreal forest composition for successfully tracing the origin of Arctic driftwood. To ultimately reconstruct spatiotemporal variations in ocean currents, and to better quantify postglacial uplift rates, we recommend consideration of dendrochronologically dated material from many more circumpolar sites.

AB  - Abstract? Sphincter of Oddi manometry (SOM) is the gold standard for assessing sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD), but is considered a diagnostic sensitivity of 30?80% and associated with significant complications of pancreatitis. Electromyography (EMG) of sphincter of Oddi (SO) using a circular electrode (CE) may be useful in improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing complications. To evaluate the feasibility and reliability of the CE, we record myoelectric activity of SO in rabbits using the CE to compare with the traditional needle electrode (NE). The CE was prepared using a double-channel biogel catheter with two silver rings at the head of the catheter. The CE was then inserted into the lumen of the SO through the duodenal papilla, and myoelectric activity was recorded in the SO in 30 rabbits. An EMG recorded using an NE was performed at the same time, when the SO was in basal state, after injection of cholecystokinin and N-butylscopolamine bromide. Electromyographs recorded by the two methods were then evaluated. Satisfactory SO EMGs were acquired using the CE without any injury. Simultaneous recording revealed a very similar traces and one-to-one correspondence of SO spike bursts (SOSB). Linear regression analysis showed a significant direct correlation between the two methods for SOSB duration and amplitude. The results suggested that CE was comparable with NE in terms of recording efficacy. The CE also has advantages of easy fixation, accurate localisation, broad applicability and ease of achieving satisfactory outcomes without trauma, compared with the NE.

AB  - A three-year-old male neutered domestic shorthair cat was presented for loss of vision associated with hyperthermia, lethargy and anorexia. Ophthalmic examination revealed a bilateral panuveitis. Cytological examination of aqueous and vitreous humours was performed and revealed a suppurative inflammation associated with numerous cocci. Enterococcus faecalis was identified by bacterial culture from aqueous and vitreous humour. No primary infection site was identified. Active uveitis resolved after systemic antibiotic therapy, but the vision loss was permanent. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first reported case of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis secondary to E. faecalis infection in a cat.

AB  - Reflex sympathetic dystrophy. (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY) Int J Dermatol 2000;39:481?486. This review aimed to familiarize the dermatologist with the essential features of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. It highlights areas that are most likely to be of interest to the dermatologist. Information regarding diagnosis, pathogenesis theories, and treatment are included. Comment by Enrique Reig, MD. This paper analyses RSD from the point of view of a specialist in dermatology. It addresses in depth the definition of RSD (or the new name, CRPS type I), the symptoms required for adequate diagnosis, some theories to explain this syndrome, and some of the treatments available. It highlights the clinical pictures, which can cause RSD (trauma, ischemia, tumors, infection, neurological and iatrogenic causes), and particularly dermatological syndromes (minor surgery, postherpetic neuralgia, Dupuytren, vasculitis ?). The treatment has a bipolar objective: to relieve pain in order to be able to apply appropriate physical therapy, which will allow recovery of the involved limb. There are more than 60 treatments reported in the literature, suggesting that there is no universal protocol. However, prevention of RSD, and particularly the early onset of treatment are essential for achieving functional and pain relief. To suppress sympathetic hyperactivity, nerve blocks (somatic and sympathetic), intravenous regional blockade with guanethidine or reserpine, alpha blockers (phentolamine), beta blockers (propranolol), and calcitonine can be used. No reference is made to anticonvulsants (gabapentine, topiramate), antidepressants (ie, amitriptyline), intravenous lidocaine, or spinal cord stimulation.

AB  - Abstract Throughout much of the African continent, healthcare systems are already strained in their efforts to meet the needs of a growing population using limited resources. Climate change threatens to undermine many of the public health gains that have been made in this region in the last several decades via multiple mechanisms, including malnutrition secondary to drought-induced food insecurity, mass human displacement from newly uninhabitable areas, exacerbation of environmentally sensitive chronic diseases, and enhanced viability of pathogenic microbes and their vectors. We reviewed the literature describing the various direct and indirect effects of climate change on diseases with cutaneous manifestations in Africa. We included non-communicable diseases such as malignancies (non-melanoma skin cancers), inflammatory dermatoses (i.e. photosensitive dermatoses, atopic dermatitis), and trauma (skin injury), as well as communicable diseases and neglected tropical diseases. Physicians should be aware of the ways in which climate change threatens human health in low- and middle-income countries in general, and particularly in countries throughout Africa, the world's lowest-income and second most populous continent.

AB  - To effectively prevent sport traumatic brain injury (TBI), means of protection need to be designed and tested in relation to the reality of head impact. This study quantifies head impacts during a typical snowboarding accident to evaluate helmet standards. A snowboarder numerical model was proposed, validated against experimental data, and used to quantify the influence of accident conditions (speed, snow stiffness, morphology, and position) on head impacts (locations, velocities, and accelerations) and injury risk during snowboarding backward falls. Three hundred twenty-four scenarios were simulated: 70% presented a high risk of mild TBI (head peak acceleration >80 g) and 15% presented a high risk of severe TBI (head injury criterion >1000). Snow stiffness, speed, and snowboarder morphology were the main factors influencing head impact metrics. Mean normal head impact speed (28 ± 6 km/h) was higher than equivalent impact speed used in American standard helmet test (ASTM F2040), and mean tangential impact speed, not included in standard tests, was 13.8 (±7 km/h). In 97% of simulated impacts, the peak head acceleration was below 300 g, which is the pass/fail criteria used in standard tests. Results suggest that initial speed, impacted surface, and pass/fail criteria used in helmet standard performance tests do not fully reflect magnitude and variability of snowboarding backward-fall impacts.
