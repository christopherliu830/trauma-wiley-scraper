AB  - Growing clinical evidence suggests critical involvement of spreading depolarizations (SDs) in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders such as migraine and stroke. MRI provides powerful tools to detect and assess co-occurring cerebral hemodynamic and cellular changes during SDs. This study reports the feasibility and advantages of two MRI scans, based on balanced steady-state free precession (b-SSFP) and diffusion-weighted multi-spin-echo (DT2), heretofore unexplored for monitoring SDs. These were compared with gradient-echo MRI. SDs were induced by KCl application in rat brain. Known for high SNR, the T2- and T1-based b-SSFP contrast was hypothesized to provide higher spatiotemporal specificity than -based gradient-echo scanning. DT2 scanning was designed to provide simultaneous T2 and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements, thus enabling combined quantitative assessment of hemodynamic and cellular changes during SDs. Procedures were developed to automate identification of SD-induced responses in all the scans. These responses were analyzed to determine detection sensitivity and temporal characteristics of signals from each scanning method. Cluster analysis was performed to elucidate unique temporal patterns for each contrast. All scans allowed detection of SD-induced responses. b-SSFP scans showed significantly larger relative intensity changes, narrower peak widths and greater spatial specificity compared with gradient-echo MRI. SD-induced effects on ADC, calculated from DT2 scans, showed the most pronounced signal changes, displaying about 20% decrease, as against 10?15% signal increases observed with b-SSFP and gradient-echo scanning. Cluster analysis revealed additional temporal sub-patterns, such as an initial dip on gradient-echo scans and temporally shifted T2 and proton density changes in DT2 data. To summarize, b-SSFP and DT2 scanning provide distinct information on SDs compared with gradient-echo MRI. DT2 scanning, with its potential to simultaneously provide cellular and hemodynamic information, can offer unique information on the inter-relationship between these processes in pathologic brain, which may improve monitoring of spreading depolarizations in (pre)clinical settings.

AB  - Abstract Throughout much of the African continent, healthcare systems are already strained in their efforts to meet the needs of a growing population using limited resources. Climate change threatens to undermine many of the public health gains that have been made in this region in the last several decades via multiple mechanisms, including malnutrition secondary to drought-induced food insecurity, mass human displacement from newly uninhabitable areas, exacerbation of environmentally sensitive chronic diseases, and enhanced viability of pathogenic microbes and their vectors. We reviewed the literature describing the various direct and indirect effects of climate change on diseases with cutaneous manifestations in Africa. We included non-communicable diseases such as malignancies (non-melanoma skin cancers), inflammatory dermatoses (i.e. photosensitive dermatoses, atopic dermatitis), and trauma (skin injury), as well as communicable diseases and neglected tropical diseases. Physicians should be aware of the ways in which climate change threatens human health in low- and middle-income countries in general, and particularly in countries throughout Africa, the world's lowest-income and second most populous continent.

AB  - Abstract Objectives? To quantify the change in the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of isoflurane (ISO) associated with oxymorphone (OXY) or hydromorphone (HYDRO) in dogs. Design? Randomized crossover study with at least 1?week between assessments. Animals? Six young, healthy, mixed-breed dogs (1?3?years old), weighing 24.7?±?4.70?kg. Methods? Following mask induction, anesthesia was maintained with ISO in 100% O2 using mechanical ventilation. The dogs received 0.05?mg?kg?1 OXY, 0.1?mg?kg?1 HYDRO, or 1?mL saline (control) IV. Following equilibration (15?minutes) at each percentage ISO tested, a supramaximal electrical stimulus was applied to the toe web and the response was assessed. Two separate MAC determinations were carried out during 4.5?hours of anesthesia, with completion of the evaluations at 1.5?2 and 4?4.5?hours after drug administration. A two-factor anova was used to determine whether there was a time or treatment effect on MAC and a Tukey test compared the drug effects at each time. Significance is reported at p?<?0.05. Results? The mean MAC values (±SD) were 1.2?±?0.18 and 1.2?±?0.16% for control, 0.7?±0.15 and 1.0?±?0.15% for OXY, and 0.6?±?0.14 and 0.8?±?0.17% for HYDRO. The initial MAC with OXY and the MAC determined at both times with HYDRO were significantly different from the control MAC values. Conclusions? Both OXY and HYDRO significantly reduced the MAC of ISO in dogs at 2?hours. At approximately 4.5?hours, HYDRO had a significant MAC-sparing effect, whereas OXY did not. Clinical relevance? Although both OXY and HYDRO resulted in a significant reduction in the MAC of ISO at approximately 2?hours, HYDRO may be preferred for procedures of long duration and rarely needs repeated dosing before 4.5?hours.

AB  - Abstract Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is correlated with angiogenesis and early relapse of colorectal cancer (CRC). This study investigated the role of miR-148a in the regulation of VEGF/angiogenesis and early relapse of CRC. We established a stable clone with miR-148a expression in HCT116 and HT29 cell lines and created a hypoxic condition by using CoCl2 to determine the underlying mechanism of miR-148a. The effects of miR-148a on the phosphoryl-ERK (pERK)/hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)/VEGF pathway were evaluated through Western blotting and the inhibitory effect of miR-148a on angiogenesis was demonstrated through a tube formation assay. Sixty-three CRC tissues (28 early relapse and 35 non-early relapse) were analysed to assess the relationship between miR-148a and HIF-1α/VEGF. The protein expression of pERK/HIF-1α/VEGF in HCT116 and HT29 cells was significantly decreased by miR-148a (all P < 0.05). The protein expression of VEGF/HIF-1α was strongly inversely associated with the expression of miR-148a in the 63 CRC tissue samples (all P < 0.05). Tube formation assay demonstrated that miR-148a significantly obliterated angiogenesis. miR-148a suppresses VEGF through down-regulation of the pERK/HIF-1α/VEGF pathway and might lead to the inhibition of angiogenesis; miR-148a down-regulation increased the early relapse rate of CRC. This demonstrates that miR-148a is a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target.

AB  - Abstract Background The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a multi-ligand receptor in the immunoglobulin superfamily. RAGE is localized throughout ascending sensory pathways (skin, peripheral nerve, dorsal root ganglion, spinal cord), and in cell types interacting with sensory neurons (endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, monocytes and macrophages). Neuronal RAGE expression increases in pathological pain states in humans and rodents, and soluble RAGE attenuates thermal hypoalgesia in diabetic mice. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether pharmacological modulation of RAGE could attenuate mechanical allodynia in rodent pain models. Methods We developed an anti-RAGE monoclonal antibody (11E6) that binds to the C2 immunoglobulin domain of human RAGE, binds to mouse RAGE, and presumably to the same domain in mouse RAGE. The antinociceptive activity of 11E6 was investigated in mouse models of inflammatory (complete Freund's adjuvant) and neuropathic (chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve) pain. Mice were dosed intraperitoneally with 11E6 or IgG (negative control). Results Increased mechanical thresholds were observed following a single dose of 11E6 in both inflammatory and neuropathic pain models. Similar treatment with IgG did not alter nociceptive sensitivity. Repeated dosing with 11E6 significantly attenuated established mechanical hypersensitivity in a neuropathic pain model in a dose-related fashion. Conclusions These data demonstrate that specific modulation of RAGE effectively attenuates nociceptive sensitivity associated with chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain states.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective: To determine the potential utility of cytokine and arachidonic acid metabolite levels in ED patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) as a predictor of progression to severe sepsis. Methods: A prospective, observational study of test performance was performed using convenience samples of adult control subjects and admitted patients. The latter patients were identified in the ED as having signs of SIRS. Levels of cytokines and arachidonic acid metabolites measured from specimens obtained in the ED were compared between groups and associated with the progression of sepsis within 24 hours in the SIRS patients. Results: There were 30 control patients and 29 SIRS patients. There were 8 SIRS subjects who progressed to severe sepsis within 24 hours using the following criteria (hypotension, n = 5; hypoperfusion, n = 1; and organ dysfunction, n = 2). Of the 21 SIRS subjects who did not progress to severe sepsis, 11 had resolution of SIRS criteria at 24 hours. There were no significant differences in mean mediator levels between the SIRS patients who progressed to severe sepsis and those who did not. Of the 11 patients with resolution of SIRS criteria at 24 hours, the mean interleukin-6 (IL-6) level was significantly lower than that for the patients who did not recover or who progressed at 24 hours (n = 18); 65.4 ± 49.1 vs 230 ±112 pg/mL, p = 0.001). Six of 15 subjects with IL-6 >150 pg/mL progressed to severe sepsis (p = NS). Using threshold values based on the range of levels for normals, the sensitivity of an abnormal marker for the development of severe sepsis within 24 hours varied from 50% to 87%, while the specificity varied from 11% to 84%. Conclusion: While mean levels were significantly elevated when compared with those of normal control subjects, they had limited ability to predict the subset of patients likely to progress to severe sepsis. However, initial low levels of cytokines may have exclusionary prognostic value. Prospective validation of the latter finding is warranted.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective: To identify clinical findings and predisposing conditions associated with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in ambulatory patients being evaluated for PE. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted. A standardized multicomponent data collection form was administered to ambulatory subjects being evaluated for PE. The diagnosis of PE was confirmed or excluded using a combination of scintillation lung scanning, lower-extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography, and selective use of pulmonary angiography. Results: Data collection was completed for 170 subjects, with 26 (15%) cases of PE. Subjects with PE were significantly older (56 vs 41 years, 99% CI for difference of 15 years [6 to 25 years]), were more likely to report unexplained dyspnea (92% vs 69%. 99% CI for difference of 23% [7% to 40%]), and waited longer after symptom onset to seek medical evaluation (73 vs 36 hours, 99% CI for difference of 37 hours [I1 to 63 hours]). No difference was found for multiple variables commonly associated with PE. Assignment to risk categories was of limited diagnostic utility. For example, low-risk assignment yielded 85% sensitivity, 20% specificity; high-risk assignment: 31% sensitivity, 85% specificity, with diagnostic accuracy below 80% in both categories. Conclusions: Among outpatients selected for evaluation for PE, further risk stratification demonstrated poor diagnostic utility. Clinical features alone cannot be used to differentiate presence or absence of PE in at-risk ambulatory patients. Key words: pulmonary embolism; diagnosis; outpatient; risk; clinical features.

AB  - Abstract. Objective: To compare the effects of octylcyanoacrylate (OCA), silver sulfadiazine (SSD), polyurethane film (PU), and dry gauze (G) on scarring three months after partial-thickness burns. Methods: This was a prospective, blinded, controlled experimental trial using isoflurane-anesthetized swine. Standardized partial-thickness burns were inflicted by applying an aluminum bar preheated to 80°C to the backs and flanks of a young pig for 20 seconds. Four equal sets of ten burns each were randomly treated with OCA spray, SSD, PU, or G. Dressing changes were performed on days 1, 2, 3, and 4 after injury. Digital images of the burns were obtained immediately and three months later for masked computerized determination of scar surface area. Full-thickness biopsies were taken at three months for masked histopathological evaluation. The primary outcome was the percent reduction in residual wound area (RWA) calculated by subtracting the area of each individual burn from the area of the largest burn and dividing this value by the area of the largest burn (intraobserver correlation, r = 0.99). Secondary outcomes were the proportion of burns with the presence of scar tissue (abnormal collagen under polarized light; intraobserver agreement, ?= 0.93) and the cosmetic appearance on a 100-mm visual analog scale marked ?best scar? at the high end (inter-observer correlation, r = 0.82). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and ?2 tests were used for group comparisons as appropriate. This study had 80% power to detect a 33-percentage-point difference in RWA among groups (α= 0.05). Results: A total of 40 burns were inflicted on the pig. There was no difference in percent RWA across the groups (OCA = 25%, SSD = 40%, PU = 25%, G = 32%; p = 0.13). There was no difference in the proportion of wounds with scarring among the groups (OCA = 10%, SSD = 22%, PU = 2%, G = 30%; p = 0.89). There was also no difference in the cosmetic scores among the groups (OCA = 78 mm, SSD = 75 mm, PU = 74 mm, G = 74 mm; p = 0.96). Conclusions: The effects of OCA spray, SSD, PU, and dry gauze on scarring three months after burns in pigs are similar.

AB  - Summary Growing evidence suggests that mitochondrial inhibition plays a major role in the development of multiple organ failure during sepsis. Early correction of tissue hypoxia, strict control of glycaemia and modulation of oxidative and nitrosative stress may protect mitochondria during the acute inflammatory response. Once mitochondrial dysfunction has developed, the regulated induction of a hypometabolic state, analogous to hibernation, may protect the cells from severe bioenergetic failure and a critical fall in ATP. Though this is clinically manifest as organ dysfunction, it may actually represent an adaptive response to a prolonged, severe inflammatory stress. Repair of damaged organelles, stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and re-activation of cellular metabolism may accelerate the recovery phase and thus improve clinical outcomes. The aim of this review is to discuss putative interventions aimed at preventing or reversing mitochondrial dysfunction that may have possible clinical relevance, and to stress the importance of the correct timing of intervention.

AB  - Abstract: The replacement of teeth by implants is usually restricted to patients with completed craniofacial growth. Implant insertions in children or adolescents are circumvented due to several unfavorable potential effects including trauma to tooth germs, tooth eruption disorders and multidimensional restrictions of skeletal craniofacial growth. Moreover, the functional and esthetic results of the oral rehabilitation are only temporary acceptable. However, to a small number of pediatric patients suffering congenitally from severe hypodontia caused by syndromes such as ectodermal dysplasia, conventional prosthodontic rehabilitations are insufficient. We report the case of a boy with ectodermal dysplasia who exhibited a severe hypodontia and who was treated with implants inserted into the anterior mandible at the age of 8 years. The implants were functionally loaded and resulted in a high patient satisfaction. We recommend the early insertion of dental implants in children with severe hypodontia. Reviewing the current literature, several aspects of syndromic hypodontia, patient selection and implant planning are discussed.

AB  - Background The increasing use of fresh blood group O whole blood in acute trauma medicine makes it important to reevaluate the issue of hemolytic reactions related to the transfusion of ABO-incompatible plasma. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS This review summarizes and evaluates published articles and case reports concerning hemolytic reactions in connection with the transfusion of group O whole blood or blood products to nongroup O recipients. Results In 1945-1986, 15 nonmilitary publications reported hemolytic transfusion reactions with group O blood/blood products. All patients recovered except for two fatalities. Late in World War II and during the Korean and Vietnam wars and onward in Iraq and Afghanistan only ?low anti-A, anti-B titer? group O whole blood has been used as universal blood. In spite of a large number of units transfused, there are no reports of hemolytic reactions. Twenty-five publications report hemolytic reactions after transfusion of group O platelets to nongroup O recipients. In all patients but one, the titer of the implicated A- or B-antibody was >100 (saline) or >400 (antiglobulin) and all cases with an infused volume of incompatible plasma <200?mL were related to anti-A or anti-B antiglobulin titers >1000. Conclusion In emergency lifesaving resuscitation, the risk of hemolytic transfusion reactions from transfusion of group O blood to nongroup O recipients constitutes risk that is outweighed by the benefits. A low titer of anti-A/B will minimize the risk for a hemolytic reaction, particularly if the screening is repeated after an immunization episode, e.g., blood transfusion, vaccination, or pregnancy.

AB  - Abstract The mechanism by which trauma initiates healing remains unclear. Precise understanding of these events may define interventions for accelerating healing that could be translated to the clinical arena. We previously reported that addition of low-dose recombinant human TNF (rhTNF) at the fracture site augmented fracture repair in a murine tibial fracture model. Here, we show that local rhTNF treatment is only effective when administered within 24 h of injury, when neutrophils are the major inflammatory cell infiltrate. Systemic administration of anti-TNF impaired fracture healing. Addition of rhTNF enhanced neutrophil recruitment and promoted recruitment of monocytes through CCL2 production. Conversely, depletion of neutrophils or inhibition of the chemokine receptor CCR2 resulted in significantly impaired fracture healing. Fragility, or osteoporotic, fractures represent a major medical problem as they are associated with permanent disability and premature death. Using a murine model of fragility fractures, we found that local rhTNF treatment improved fracture healing during the early phase of repair. If translated clinically, this promotion of fracture healing would reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with delayed patient mobilization.

AB  - Aims Type 1 diabetes can be complicated with neuropathy that involves immune-mediated and inflammatory pathways. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists such as liraglutide, have shown anti-inflammatory properties, and thus we hypothesized that long-term treatment with liraglutide induced diminished inflammation and thus improved neuronal function. Methods The study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of adults with type 1 diabetes and confirmed symmetrical polyneuropathy. They were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either liraglutide or placebo. Titration was 6 weeks to 1.2?1.8 mg/d, continuing for 26 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in latency of early brain evoked potentials. Secondary endpoints were changes in proinflammatory cytokines, cortical evoked potential, autonomic function and peripheral neurophysiological testing. Results Thirty-nine patients completed the study, of whom 19 received liraglutide. In comparison to placebo, liraglutide reduced interleukin-6 (?22.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: ?38.1, ?3.2; P = .025) with concomitant numerical reductions in other proinflammatory cytokines. However neuronal function was unaltered at the central, autonomic or peripheral level. Treatment was associated with ?3.38 kg (95% CI: ?5.29, ?1.48; P < .001] weight loss and a decrease in urine albumin/creatinine ratio (?40.2%; 95% CI: ?60.6, ?9.5; P = .02). Conclusion Hitherto, diabetic neuropathy has no cure. Speculations can be raised whether mechanism targeted treatment, e.g. lowering the systemic level of proinflammatory cytokines may lead to prevention or treatment of the neuroinflammatory component in early stages of diabetic neuropathy. If ever successful, this would serve as an example of how fundamental mechanistic principles are translated into clinical practice similar to those applied in the cardiovascular and nephrological clinic.

AB  - Abstract Objective To investigate the effect of hemicerclage suture on the occurrence of fractures during advancement of an elongated bi-directional hinged osteotomy (EBHO) for tibial tuberosity advancement (TTA) in dogs. Study design Experimental ex vivo study. Animals Canine cadavers (n?=?14) Methods A uniform EBHO was performed in 28 cadaveric hind limbs (n?=?28) from 14 skeletally mature, medium-sized, mixed breed dogs. Paired limbs were randomly assigned with or without hemicerclage suture. The osteotomy was slowly spread (TTA) at a rate 1.5 mm every 15 seconds to a maximum distance of 24 mm or until a fracture was detected as an audible crack, visible propagation of the distal osteotomy or transverse fracture of the cortical bridge. The occurrence of fractures was compared between limbs with hemicerclage and without hemicerclage (control) suture using a chi-square analysis. The advancement distance at the time of fracture was compared using a paired t test. A P value <.05 was considered significant. Results The cumulative occurrence of intraoperative fracture was significantly greater without hemicerclage than with hemicerclage at advancements of 12, 15, 18, and 24 mm. The mean (SD) spreading distance at the time of fracture was significantly less without hemicerclage at 16.85 (4.10) mm with a range of 12-24 mm, than with hemicerclage at 20.62 (2.39) mm with a range of 18-24 mm (P?=?.029). Conclusion The occurrence of immediate intraoperative fracture during advancement of an EBHO of the tibial tuberosity is less when a hemicerclage suture is placed.

AB  - As society ages, aging medical problems such as organ damage or failure among senior citizens increases, raising the demand for organ repair technologies. Synthetic materials have been developed and applied in various parts of human body to meet the biomedical needs. Hydrogels, in particular, have found extensive applications as wound healing, drug delivery and controlled release, and scaffold materials in the human body. The development of the next generation of soft hydrogel biomaterials focuses on facile synthetic methods, efficacy of treatment, and tunable multi-functionalities for applications. Supramolecular 3D entities are highly attractive materials for biomedical application. They are assembled by modules via various non-covalent bonds (hydrogen bonds, p?p stacking and/or van der Waals interactions). Biodegradable thermogels are a class of such supramolecular assembled materials. Their use as soft biomaterials and their related applications are described in this Review.

AB  - Summary This chapter includes a collection of miscellaneous organisms that have caused disease in poultry or are a public health concern. The less common pathogens implicated in poultry loss included are Staphylococcosis, Streptococcus and Enterococcus, Erysipelas, avian intestinal spirochetosis, tuberculosis. Disease syndromes included in the chapter include beak necrosis, venereal disease of geese, and liver granulomas, but are not identified to a specific organism responsible because of the multifactorial nature of the disease. Staphylococcosis is diagnosed by culturing suspected clinical material including exudate from joints, yolk material, and stab swabs of internal organs. Staphylococcosis can resemble infection with Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella gallinarum, Mycoplasma synoviae, reoviruses, or any other infection of bones or joints that is hatchery-related, associated with mechanical trauma, or causes septicemia. Prevention and control of Enterococcus infections require reducing stress and preventing immunosuppressive diseases and conditions. Proper cleaning and disinfection can reduce environmental enterococcal resident flora to minimize external exposure.

AB  - Regression in melanoma can be complete or partial. Melanocytic nevi may show focal regression-like changes (RLC). We studied the incidence of RLC in a total of 777 melanocytic back nevi. These included 17 cases of blue nevi, 28 cases of compound nevi, 385 cases of compound dysplastic nevi, 34 cases of congenital compound nevi, 26 cases of congenital intradermal nevi, 58 cases of intradermal nevi, and 229 cases of junctional dysplastic nevi. The dysplastic nevi were categorised according to the associated cytologic atypia (mild, moderate, and severe). 21 malignant melanomas of the back were also reviewed for regression. RLC were seen with a striking correlation with the degree of cytologic atypia in dysplastic nevi. RLC were seen in 4.5% of mildly, 9.6% of moderately, and 17.2% of severely dysplastic compound nevi. RLC were seen in 10.3% of mildly, 18.8% of moderately, and 39.3% of severely dysplastic junctional nevi. The incidence of regression in non-dysplastic nevi was much less, ranging from 2.9% to 3.6%. We believe this phenomenon is probably related to trauma/irritation. Caution should be taken before rendering the diagnosis of regressed malignant melanoma on the back since dysplastic nevi may show focal similar changes.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Hypothermia has a well-established neuroprotective effect and offers a foundation for combination therapy for brain ischemia. The authors evaluated the effect of combination therapy with insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and hypothermia on brain structure and function in the setting of global brain ischemia and reperfusion in rats. Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to groups by a registrar. Animals were subjected to 8 minutes of global brain ischemia using bilateral carotid occlusion and systemic hypotension, followed by 7 days (Stage I dose studies) or 28 days (Stage II outcome studies) of reperfusion. Sham controls were subjected to surgery, but not ischemia. Stage II animals were randomized to no treatment, IGF-1 at the dose determined in Stage I, hypothermia (32°C for 4 hours), or a combination of IGF-1 and hypothermia. Stage II animals underwent 21 days of spatial memory testing. At 7 days (Stage I) or 28 days (Stage II), brains were harvested for counting of CA1 neurons. The primary Stage II outcome was a neurologic outcome index computed as the ratio of viable CA1 neurons per 300-?m field to the number of days to reach success criteria on the memory task. Results Stage I experiments confirmed the neuroprotective effect of the hypothermia protocol and IGF-1 at a dose of 0.6 U/kg. Stage II studies suggested that early neuroprotection with hypothermia and IGF-1 was not well maintained to 28 days and that combination therapy was more beneficial than either IGF-1 or hypothermia alone. Median and interquartile ranges (IQRs) of viable neurons per 300-?m field were 114 (IQR = 99.5 to 136) for sham, three (IQR = 2 to 4.8) for untreated ischemia, four (IQR = 3 to 70.25) for ischemia treated with IGF-1 alone, 25 (IQR = 3 to 70) for ischemia treated with hypothermia alone, and 78 (IQR 47.3 to 97.5) for ischemia treated with combination therapy. Days to memory success criteria were 13.6 (IQR = 11.5 to 15.5 days) for sham, 23.5 (IQR = 20 to 25.5 days) for untreated ischemia, 17.5 (IQR = 15.5 to 25.5 days) for ischemia treated with IGF-1, 15 (IQR = 14.5 to 21 days) for ischemia treated with hypothermia, and 13.5 (IQR = 12.25 to 18.5 days) for ischemia treated with combination therapy. Neurologic outcome indices were 8.5 (IQR = 7.4 to 9.5) for sham, 0.14 (IQR = 0.08 to 0.2) for untreated ischemia, 0.18 (IQR = 0.17 to 4.6) for ischemia treated with IGF-1, 0.7 (IQR = 0.2 to 4.8) for ischemia treated with hypothermia, and 5.7 (IQR = 3.3 to 6.2) for ischemia treated with combination therapy. Statistically significant differences in neuron counts, days to memory test criteria, and outcome index were found between sham and untreated ischemic animals. Of the three treatment regimens, only combination therapy showed a statistically significant difference from the untreated ischemic group for neuronal salvage (p = 0.02), days to criteria (p = 0.043), and outcome index (p = 0.014). Conclusions Combination therapy with IGF-1 (0.6 U/kg) and therapeutic hypothermia (32°C for 4 hours) at the onset of reperfusion synergistically preserves CA1 structure and function at 28 days after 8 minutes of global brain ischemia in healthy male rats.
