AB  - Abstract Hybridization of nanoscale metals and carbon nanotubes into composite nanomaterials has produced some of the best-performing sensors to date. The challenge remains to develop scalable nanofabrication methods that are amenable to the development of sensors with broad sensing ranges. A scalable nanostructured biosensor based on multilayered graphene petal nanosheets (MGPNs), Pt nanoparticles, and a biorecognition element (glucose oxidase) is presented. The combination of zero-dimensional nanoparticles on a two-dimensional support that is arrayed in the third dimension creates a sensor platform with exceptional characteristics. The versatility of the biosensor platform is demonstrated by altering biosensor performance (i.e., sensitivity, detection limit, and linear sensing range) through changing the size, density, and morphology of electrodeposited Pt nanoparticles on the MGPNs. This work enables a robust sensor design that demonstrates exceptional performance with enhanced glucose sensitivity (0.3 ÂµM detection limit, 0.01?50 mM linear sensing range), a long stable shelf-life (>1 month), and a high selectivity over electroactive, interfering species commonly found in human serum samples.

AB  - Abstract The phenolic composition, antioxidant capacity, and the dsDNA oxidative damage protecting properties, of ten honey and two pollen samples, from different countries, Portugal, Algeria, Romania, and Greece, using differential pulse voltammetry, DPPH. spectrophotometric assay, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, and agarose gel electrophoresis, were investigated. The honey samples highest antioxidant capacity was from Multi floral from Greece and the lowest for Mono floral black locust from Romania. The pollen from Romania presented higher antioxidant capacity compared with the pollen from Portugal but both pollen samples have a greater antioxidant capacity compared with the honey samples. In the presence of honey and pollen the DNA oxidative damage, induced by hydroxyl radicals generated through the Fenton reaction, was decreased.

AB  - Localized chronic fibrosing vasculitis is a rare dermatosis that histologically resembles late-stage erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) but has a different clinical presentation. A 62-year-old male presented with bilateral nodules on his heels that first appeared two years ago and over the past six months had become extremely painful. He denied any recent trauma to the sites, and his medical history was significant only for diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and osteoarthritis. Physical exam demonstrated focally ulcerated violet-red three-centimeter nodules on the medial aspects of both heels. Biopsy revealed dense concentric and lamellar fibrosis with foci of leukocytoclastic debris and a sparse infiltrate of histiocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. No granulomas were present, and histochemical stains and tissue cultures for microorganisms were negative. Imaging studies showed no evidence of underlying osteomyelitis, cellulitis, or abscess formation. Laboratory studies demonstrated a markedly elevated IgA level that was shown to be polyclonal on serum immunofixation studies. All peripheral blood cell counts were normal. Thorough evaluations for systemic vasculitides and connective tissue disorders were negative. A diagnosis of localized chronic fibrosing vasculitis was made. This case illustrates the clinicopathologic overlap between this disorder and EED.

AB  - Abstract Aim? To measure and compare the responses of pulp tissue to cavity preparation and restoration variables using a novel tooth slice culture model. Methodology? Experimental cavities (265) were continuously cut, under carefully controlled conditions, into the dentine of the labial aspect of 28-day-old Wistar rat incisors, and slices of these teeth maintained in organ culture for up to 2?weeks. The experimental variables examined were: the preparation method, remaining dentine thickness, coolant, drill speed, conditioning with EDTA and filling materials. The reactions of the dentine?pulp complex to the experimental variables were measured using pathohistometric analysis and the correlations between variables were determined using analysis of variance statistical tests. Results? In rank order of surgically induced restorative pulpal injury, from the most to the least injurious were: remaining dentine thickness, absence of coolant during cavity preparation, bur speed, cavity conditioning treatments and the filling material. Conclusions? To reduce pulp injury and to promote pulpal repair activity, the correct use of appropriate materials are important. However, of relatively greater importance is the operative technique adopted, the need to avoid the excess removal of dentine and to minimize trauma during preparation.

AB  - Cochlear implants restore the inner ear hearing using electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. However, there is potential to improve the implant's function in terms of stimulation selectivity by increasing the number of electrode contacts. Meanwhile, the electrode stiffness shall not be elevated, because this would enhance insertion trauma and fibrous tissue encapsulation of the implant. Since the increase in the number of electrode contacts results in an increase of electrode stiffness, novel materials are needed for manufacturing electrode shafts. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as electrode contacts offer new perspectives concerning mechanical properties and electrode-nerve interfacing. However, by using CNTs immersed in liquid silicone rubber (LSR) as electrode material, the electrical conductivity of the bulk needs to be improved. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of using CNT?LSR as electrode material by increasing the conductivity of such materials and confirming their biocompatibility. First results show, that the electrode material can be printed in isolated layers, while the conductivity of the bulk can be improved. Fibroblasts growth tests indicated biocompatible properties of CNT?LSR samples. In conclusion CNT?LSR materials can be considered as promising candidates for use in neural implants possessing proper mechanical, electrical as well as biocompatible properties.

AB  - Abstract Chronic diabetic complications ? both microvascular and macrovascular ? have become serious health issues with their increasing prevalence paralleling the dramatic rise of the diabetic population worldwide. Of these complications, foot disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, consuming more health care resource than all other complications combined. Diabetic polyneuropathy and peripheral vascular disease constitute the two main risk factors, with trauma and foot infection being the most important initiating factors and contributors to delayed healing. Intracellular oxidative stress mediated by hyperglycaemia along with hypertension, dyslipidaemia and smoking constitute the main pathological processes in the aetiology of both macrovascular and microvascular disease. Whilst the former remains the major cause of overall mortality in diabetes, the role of microangiopathy in the pathogenesis of diabetes foot disease and its contribution to delayed wound healing in diabetes has yet to be fully understood and indeed continues to be debated. This article will review the key findings to date on structural and functional microvascular abnormalities in the diabetic foot skin and consider their contribution to impaired would healing.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Human dental pulp cells (HDPCs) with multi-potential differentiational capacity can undergo odontoblastic differentiation when stimulated with proinflammatory cytokines. However, factors linking proinflammatory stimuli and their odontoblastic differentiation have, as yet, not been completely understood. As an apoptotic transcription factor, DDIT3 plays a crucial role in the inflammatory reaction and in osteogenic differentiation. Thus, we hypothesized that DDIT3 may participate in odontoblastic differentiation of HDPCs. Materials and methods Immunofluorescent staining was used to detect expression of DDIT3 in HDPCs and effects of TNFÎ±, on its nuclear accumulation. HDPCs that overexpressed DDIT3 were developed and their proliferation and odontoblastic differentiation abilities were examined. qRT-PCR was employed to detect mineralization-related genes, including ALP, runt-related transcription factor-2 (Runx2), osterix (OSX), dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1 (DMP1) and osteocalcin (OCN). Western blot analysis was performed to detect expression of DSPP protein. Results DDIT3 was expressed in HDPCs. TNFÎ± treatment enhanced mRNA expression as well as nuclear accumulation of DDIT3 (slightly). DDIT3 overexpression reduced HDPC proliferation, however, it increased their calcium nodule formation and expression of OSX, DSPP, DMP1 and OCN. Conclusions DDIT3 may be a factor that links proinflammatory stimuli and differentiation of HDPCs.

AB  - Root canal treatment techniques probably develop and change more frequently than any other area of dental practice and it can be hard for the busy general dental practitioner to keep up to date. The aim of this series of five papers is to give a thorough review of current teaching and practice. This will encompass the rationale of root canal treatment, guidance on the latest technical procedures for preparation and obturation of the entire root canal system, and consideration of how these principles may contribute to successful treatment. The series will address the following issues: diagnosis and treatment planning; root canal morphology and access; control of infection by effective isolation and anti-microbial agents; the philosophy of modern canal preparation techniques; single- or multi-visit treatment with relevant canal medication; obturation; diagnosis of failure and considerations in re-treatment. It is hoped that readers will be encouraged by the series to question their own techniques, audit their outcomes, and adopt new techniques only after careful reflection of the underlying principles involved.

AB  - We report the diagnosis and follow-up of a septal myocardial abscess in a seven-year-old Anglo-French hound suffering from both renal failure and urinary infection. Serial echocardiography showed the abscess enlarging and progressing into a fistula between the left ventricular outflow tract and the right ventricle. The dog died despite early wide-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy. Post-mortem examination confirmed the diagnosis. Bacterial and fungal myocardial abscesses have been described in immunodeficient human beings. To our knowledge, fistulae have rarely been described in dog hearts and only as a consequence of previous valvular endocarditis. In our case, the sigmoid cusps were not involved, so this is the first description of a septal myocardial abscess in a dog.

Forensic odontology is a key element in DVI operations. Over the past forty years forensic odontology DVI protocols and procedures have been refined and formalised, forensic odontology networks established and information and lessons-learned shared. As a result, the relative contribution of forensic odontology in DVI operations has increased significantly. The key to a timely and effective DVI response is robust preparatory planning based on international best practice standards.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Occupations characterized by a static low load and by repetitive actions show a high prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) in the neck?shoulder region. Moreover, muscle fatigue and discomfort are reported to play a relevant initiating role in WMSD. Aims: To investigate relationships between altered sensory information, i.e. localized muscle fatigue, discomfort and pain and their associations to changes in motor control patterns. Materials & Methods:? In total 101 subjects participated. Questionnaires, subjective assessments of perceived exertion and pain intensity as well as surface electromyography (SEMG), mechanomyography (MMG), force and kinematics recordings were performed. Results:? Multi-channel SEMG and MMG revealed that the degree of heterogeneity of the trapezius muscle activation increased with fatigue. Further, the spatial organization of trapezius muscle activity changed in a dynamic manner during sustained contraction with acute experimental pain. A graduation of the motor changes in relation to the pain stage (acute, subchronic and chronic) and work experience were also found. The duration of the work task was shorter in presence of acute and chronic pain. Acute pain resulted in decreased activity of the painful muscle while in subchronic and chronic pain, a more static muscle activation was found. Posture and movement changed in the presence of neck?shoulder pain. Larger and smaller sizes of arm and trunk movement variability were respectively found in acute pain and subchronic/chronic pain. The size and structure of kinematics variability decreased also in the region of discomfort. Motor variability was higher in workers with high experience. Moreover, the pattern of activation of the upper trapezius muscle changed when receiving SEMG/MMG biofeedback during computer work. Discussion:? SEMG and MMG changes underlie functional mechanisms for the maintenance of force during fatiguing contraction and acute pain that may lead to the widespread pain seen in WMSD. A lack of harmonious muscle recruitment/derecruitment may play a role in pain transition. Motor behavior changed in shoulder pain conditions underlining that motor variability may play a role in the WMSD development as corroborated by the changes in kinematics variability seen with discomfort. This prognostic hypothesis was further, supported by the increased motor variability among workers with high experience. Conclusion:? Quantitative assessments of the functional motor adaptations can be a way to benchmark the pain status and help to indentify signs indicating WMSD development. Motor variability is an important characteristic in ergonomic situations. Future studies will investigate the potential benefit of inducing motor variability in occupational settings.

AB  - Abstract In this ?Summary Guidance for Daily Practice?, we describe the basic principles of prevention and management of foot problems in persons with diabetes. This summary is based on the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) Guidance 2015. There are five key elements that underpin prevention of foot problems: (1) identification of the at-risk foot; (2) regular inspection and examination of the at-risk foot; (3) education of patient, family and healthcare providers; (4) routine wearing of appropriate footwear; and (5) treatment of pre-ulcerative signs. Healthcare providers should follow a standardized and consistent strategy for evaluating a foot wound, as this will guide further evaluation and therapy. The following items must be addressed: type, cause, site and depth, and signs of infection. There are seven key elements that underpin ulcer treatment: (1) relief of pressure and protection of the ulcer; (2) restoration of skin perfusion; (3) treatment of infection; (4) metabolic control and treatment of co-morbidity; (5) local wound care; (6) education for patient and relatives; and (7) prevention of recurrence. Finally, successful efforts to prevent and manage foot problems in diabetes depend upon a well-organized team, using a holistic approach in which the ulcer is seen as a sign of multi-organ disease, and integrating the various disciplines involved.

AB  - ABSTRACT The spatiotemporal analysis of the proteomic profile during human wound healing is a critical investigative step that can establish the complex interplay of molecular events that comprise the local response to burn injury. Partial-thickness wound samples with adjacent ?normal? skin were collected from twenty-one patients with burn wounds and examined across a time spectrum ranging from the acute injury period at 3, 6, 11 days to the later hypertrophic scar period at 7 and 15 months. The techniques used for histology-directed tissue analyses highlighted inflammatory protein markers at the early time points after injury with diminished expression as burn wounds progressed into the proliferative phase. The datasets show the usefulness of MALDI MS and imaging mass spectrometry as discovery approaches to identify and map the cutaneous molecular sequence that is activated in response to the unique systemic inflammatory response following burn trauma. This information has the potential to define the unique factors that predispose human burn victims to disfiguring hypertrophic scar formation.

AB  - Abstract The loss of cartilage tissue due to trauma, tumour surgery or congenital defects, such as microtia and anotia, is one of the major concerns in head and neck surgery. Recently tissue-engineering approaches, including gene delivery, have been proposed for the regeneration of cartilage tissue. In this study, primary chondrocytes were genetically modified with plasmid-encoding bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) via the commercially available non-viral Turbofect vector, with the aim of bringing ex vivo transfected chondrocytes to resynthesize BMP-7 in vitro as they would in vivo. Genetically modified cells were implanted into gelatin?oxidized dextran scaffolds and cartilage tissue formation was investigated in 15???15?mm auricular cartilage defects in vivo in 48 New Zealand (NZ) white rabbits for 4?months. The results were evaluated via histology and early gene expression. Early gene expression results indicated a strong effect of exogenous BMP-7 on matrix synthesis and chondrocyte growth. In addition, histological analysis results exhibited significantly better cartilage healing with BMP-7-modified (transfected) cells than in the non-modified (non-transfected) group and as well as the control.

AB  - Summary Orthodontic forces, the prescription for correcting malocclusions, are considered to have a multi-potential nature. Research has also shed light on the elevated levels of signaling molecules in the gingival crevicular fluid of moving teeth, both useful and harmful to the human body. The main effects, which are categorized as periodontal destruction following orthodontic mechanics, are loss of attachment and bone loss. External apical root resorption (EARR) entails a permanent shortening of dental roots, and formation of large lacunae that erode the roots laterally. Lacerations or irritations to oral mucosal tissues are a common clinical observation in the orthodontic office. Allergy or sensitivity reactions may occur with alloying components such as nickel, chromium and cobalt, which are often incorporated in orthodontic attachments and archwires.
