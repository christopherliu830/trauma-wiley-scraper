AB  - Summary Orthodontic forces, the prescription for correcting malocclusions, are considered to have a multi-potential nature. Research has also shed light on the elevated levels of signaling molecules in the gingival crevicular fluid of moving teeth, both useful and harmful to the human body. The main effects, which are categorized as periodontal destruction following orthodontic mechanics, are loss of attachment and bone loss. External apical root resorption (EARR) entails a permanent shortening of dental roots, and formation of large lacunae that erode the roots laterally. Lacerations or irritations to oral mucosal tissues are a common clinical observation in the orthodontic office. Allergy or sensitivity reactions may occur with alloying components such as nickel, chromium and cobalt, which are often incorporated in orthodontic attachments and archwires.

AB  - Abstract Employees in EDs report increasing role overload because of critical staff shortages, budgetary cuts and increased patient numbers and acuity. Such overload could compromise staff satisfaction with their working environment. This integrative review identifies, synthesises and evaluates current research around staff perceptions of the working conditions in EDs. A systematic search of relevant databases, using MeSH descriptors ED/EDs, Emergency room/s, ER/s, or A&E coupled with (and) working environment, working condition/s, staff perception/s, as well as reference chaining was conducted. We identified 31 key studies that were evaluated using the mixed methods assessment tool (MMAT). These comprised 24 quantitative-descriptive studies, four mixed descriptive/comparative (non-randomised controlled trial) studies and three qualitative studies. Studies included varied widely in quality with MMAT scores ranging from 0% to 100%. A key finding was that perceptions of working environment varied across clinical staff and study location, but that high levels of autonomy and teamwork offset stress around high pressure and high volume workloads. The large range of tools used to assess staff perception of working environment limits the comparability of the studies. A dearth of intervention studies around enhancing working environments in EDs limits the capacity to recommend evidence-based interventions to improve staff morale. ? 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing the study: Lateral condylar (LC) fractures of the third metacarpus (McIII) are a common reason for euthanasia in racehorses, and may be the result of repetitive overloading or cumulative pathological change. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows monitoring of bone and cartilage to detect pathological and adaptive changes that may be precursors of fracture. Objectives: To describe bone and cartilage MRI features in the distal condyles of McIII of Thoroughbred racehorses, with and without condylar fracture. Hypotheses: 1) A greater degree of bone and cartilage adaptation or pathology will be seen in fractured McIIIs compared with their respective contralateral McIIIs. 2) Contralateral McIIIs will have a greater degree of bone and cartilage adaptation or pathology than McIIIs from control horses that did not sustain a LC fracture. Methods: The McIIIs from 96 horses subjected to euthanasia at racecourses were divided into 3 groups: Group 1: nonfractured bones from horses without LC fracture; Group 2: nonfractured bones from horses with unilateral LC fracture; and Group 3: fractured bones from horses with unilateral LC fracture. The MR images were examined and graded for bone and cartilage changes. Results: Nine percent of Group 1 (n = 9) and 11% of Group 2 bones (n = 5) had incomplete LC fractures. Focal palmar necrosis was most frequently detected in bones from Group 1 (12%) compared with Groups 2 (9%) and 3 (4%). The prevalence of bone and/or cartilage abnormalities tended to increase from Group 1 to Group 2 to Group 3. Conclusions: Magnetic resonance imaging is able to detect cartilage and bone changes that may be associated with LC fracture. There was no significant difference in bone/cartilage changes between bones from Groups 1 and 2, despite increased pathology in Group 2 bones. Potential relevance: Periodic monitoring of bone and/or cartilage changes in distal McIII of Thoroughbred racehorses may help to prevent catastrophic LC fractures.

AB  - Summary Infants of birth weight ≤2500?g are termed low birth weight (LBW). These children often have considerable morbidity from prematurity and intra-uterine growth restriction. Additionally, LBW infants have increased risk for cardiac and noncardiac congenital anomalies and may require surgery. Primary rather than palliative surgical repair of cardiac lesions has been preferred in recent years. However, LBW remains a risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity after open-heart surgery (OHS). There is a paucity of information about the anesthetic challenges presented by LBW infants undergoing OHS. This review summarizes the perioperative issues of relevance to anesthesiologists who manage these high-risk patients. Emphasis is placed on management concerns that are unique to LBW infants. Retrospective data from the authors? institution are provided for those aspects of anesthetic care that lack published studies. Successful outcome often requires substantial hospital resources and collaborative multi-disciplinary effort.

AB  - Abstract Manganese (Mn) is an essential micronutrient required for the activity of metalloenzymes. It is an essential component of parenteral nutrition (PN), but requirements are low. Mn status is difficult to assess, with the commonest method being measurement of its concentration in whole blood. This method has limitations, including artifactually high concentrations resulting from contamination of specimen tubes. Mn toxicity is a well-recognized complication of PN, the risk of which increases if there is cholestasis or if the patient has received high doses. It usually presents with parkinsonian-like symptoms but may be detected presymptomatically as hypermanganesemia or as increased signal intensity of the basal ganglia upon T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Caution is necessary when providing Mn for patients on long-term PN (>1 month). It is advisable to withhold supplementation if hypermanganesemia or cholestasis develops. Deficiency of Mn is rare in patients treated with PN. PN regimens are contaminated with Mn in amounts likely to meet requirements. Consequently, it is debated whether PN should be routinely supplemented with Mn. The currently recommended dose of Mn in adults treated with PN is 55 ?g/d, but the doses provided by most currently available multi?trace element products exceed this. In response to calls for new products to be developed, 2 new multi?trace element products are currently available in Europe that provide Mn doses of 55 ?g/d. Once these products are in general use, it is likely that the incidence of Mn toxicity will decrease.

AB  - Summary Myriads of wound-care products are on the market, and making the right choice for a specific wound can be complex, especially because the scientific literature on wound-care products in horses is sparse. To select the best possible dressing, the veterinarian must decide which material is needed to enhance healing. The clinician must then determine if antimicrobial therapy is required. Several antibacterial compounds are available for topical use and are often more effective than systemically administered antibiotics in the management of severe contamination, critical colonization, or infection. To serve the requirements of specific wounds, several combinations of antimicrobial drugs and dressings are available. The wound milieu changes as healing progresses and so do the requirements for dressings. Continued assessment, based on a thorough clinical examination and sound knowledge of the healing process, is indicated, therefore, to maintain an optimal environment for healing.

AB  - Abstract Therapeutic approaches to cerebral edema require an understanding of both the magnitude and location of changes in brain water content. It is desirable to have a sensitive, accurate means of measuring brain water noninvasively so that effective therapies for cerebral edema in stroke, head trauma, and other conditions can be investigated. In this work, a three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging technique that is able to provide both spin density and T1 simultaneously is described. This method was used to quantitate regional changes in brain water content in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia. Brain water contents estimated from both relative spin density and relative T1 measurements made in vivo were compared with ex vivo measurements of relative tissue water content based on the wet-dry technique. Correlation coefficients of 0.95 and 0.98 were obtained between the wet-dry measurements and magnetic resonance measurements of T1 and spin density, respectively. Notably, the slope of the relationship between T1 and tissue water content changed dramatically after the injection of a paramagnetic contrast agent while precontrast and postcontrast spin density measurements remained essentially invariant. In addition, a plot of absolute spin density (obtained by normalizing spin density from agar gelatin phantoms of different water contents to the spin density of a sample of 100% water) was linearly related to wet-dry measurements with a slope of 0.99 (R2 = 0.99).

AB  - Uterine disease is a common cause of infertility and thus economic loss in dairy herds, yet in many herds the true incidence of disease is unknown. Accurate monitoring, identification and recording are essential to highlight when the incidence of uterine disease is too high and intervention is required. While prevention is always preferable to cure, when cases of uterine disease do occur it is important that they are treated and managed correctly to reduce any further impact on subsequent performance. This clinical forum will review the different presentations of uterine disease and seek the opinions of an expert panel on their approach to its management, monitoring and investigation.

AB  - A 24 year-old man with a 3-year history of hyperhidrosis presented with intermittent bilateral, burning, whitish translucent patches with excessive wrinkling of the palms. These symptoms occurred within minutes of exposure to water or sweat. He complained of pain with hand flexion during flares. Symptoms usually resolved within an hour of drying. Soles were spared. No relationship to pressure or trauma existed. He had no history of atopy, other skin disease, or family history of a similar disorder. Physical examination revealed several macerated patches in the center of the palms. After immersion in water for several minutes, the palms and lateral fingers became whitish, translucent, edematous, thickened, intensely wrinkled, and painful. There was no response to topical emollients and aluminum chloride. Biopsy revealed hyperkeratosis; the epidermis was otherwise unremarkable. Eccrine ostia were unremarkable. No significant inflammation was present. The eccrine epithelium was distinctively hyperplastic and papillated, with focal stratification. Glandular cells were enlarged with abundant, granular cytoplasm. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma in a male patient. All other reported cases have been in women from 9 to 33 years old. The histologic features of the present case are also unique.

AB  - Abstract A triphasic model (solid, interstices filled with water containing nutrients) is proposed for the phenomenological description of transversely isotropic saturated biological tissues including the phenomena of growth. This is done within the framework of a macro-mechanical description based on the Theory of Porous Media (TPM). Thereby, the constitutive equation of growth is determined by the state of stress and the local proportion of nutrients responsible for the mass exchange. The transversely isotropic behavior of the solid influences both the stress response and the internal fluid permeability, which is considered using an invariant formulation of the Helmholtz free energy and transversely isotropic permeability functions. After presenting the developed framework of the calculation concept including the representation of the governing weak formulations of the equations for large deformations, some representative numerical examples are examined.

AB  - SUMMARY Based on experience of 16 horses showing spontaneous epistaxis, a description is given of a previously unrecognised disease. An encapsulated haematoma originates in or near the ethmoid labyrinth and gradually expands, first into the nasal cavity and then into the nasopharynx. The principal clinical sign is a slight, persistent, unilateral nasal discharge of blood or bloodstained mucus. Other signs can include respiratory obstruction, coughing, choking and facial swelling. Diagnosis may be confirmed by rhinoscopy, radiography and trephining the paranasal sinuses. Surgical resection of the haematoma and the affected ethmoid labyrinth has been carried out in 13 horses but the lesion has recurred in five. Histologically, the capsule of the haematoma is composed of respiratory epithelium and fibrous tissue, and the stroma contains blood, macrophages, multinucleate giant cells and some fibrous tissue. The cause of this disease is not yet understood. RÉSUMÉ L'étude de seize cas de chevaux montrant un épistaxis spontané, donne l'occasion de décrire une affection jusqu'alors inconnue. Un hématome encapsulé prend naissance soit dans, soit près du labyrinthe ethmoidien. Progressivement cet hématome se développe, d'abord dans la cavité nasale puis dans le naso pharynx. Le signe clinique principal est un léger écoulement nasal unilatéral et persistant composé de sang ou de mucus mêlé de sang. Parmi les autres signes de cette affection, on peut rencontrer ceux d'une obstruction respiratoire, ceux d'une pseudo-obstruction oesophagienne, parfois de l'oedème facial, et parfois de la toux. Le diagnostic peut être confirmé par rhinoscopie, par radiographie, et en trépanant les sinus paranaseaux. La résection chirurgicale de l'hématome et du labyrinthe ethmoidien atteint a été effectuée, mais, dans deux cas sur cinq, on a observé une récidive. D'un point de vue histologique, on a constaté que la capsule de l'hématome est formée d'épithelium respiratoire et de tissu fibreux, le stroma renferme du sang, des macrophages, des cellules géantes multinucléées et du tissu fibreux. La cause de cette maladie n'est pas encore connue. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Aufgrund von Erfahrungen bei 16 Pferden mit spontaner Epistaxis wird eine bisher nicht erkannte Krankheit beschrieben. Ein abgekapseltes Haematom entsteht im oder nahe am Ethmoid und breitet sich zuerst in die Nasenhöhle später dann in den Nasopharynx aus. Das hervorstechende klinische Zeichen ist ein leichter, persistierender, unilateraler, blutiger oder blutig-mucöser Nasenausfluss. Daneben können etwa Zeichen einer respiratorischen Obstruktion, Husten, Erstickungsanfälle und Gesichtsanschwellungen beobachtet werden. Die Diagnose kann bestätigt werden durch Rhinoskopie, Röntgen und Trepanation der paranasalen Höhlen. Die Resektion des Haematoms und des affizierten ethmoidalen Labyrinths wurde durchgeführt, aber bei zwei Fünftel der Patienten stellte sich ein Recidiv ein. Histologisch besteht die Haematomkapsel aus respiratorischem Epithel und fibrösem Gewebe und das Stroma enthält Blut, Makrophagen, multinukleäre Riesenzellen und etwas fibröses Gewebe. Die Ursache der Krankheit ist noch unbekannt.

AB  - Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with a worldwide distribution affecting most mammalian species. Clinical leptospirosis is common in dogs but appears to be rare in cats. Both dogs and cats, however, can shed leptospires in the urine. This is problematic as it can lead to exposure of humans. The control of leptospirosis, therefore, is important not only from an animal but also from a public health perspective. The aim of this consensus statement is to raise awareness of leptospirosis and to outline the current knowledge on the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic tools, prevention and treatment measures relevant to canine and feline leptospirosis in Europe.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To evaluate the combined effects of enoximone and dobutamine on the cardiovascular system and respiratory gas exchange in isoflurane-anaesthetized ponies. Study design? Prospective, randomized, experimental study. Animals? Six ponies (286?±?52?kg), aged 5.0?± 1.6?years. Methods? After sedation (romifidine 80??g?kg?1), anaesthesia was induced with midazolam (0.06?mg?kg?1) and ketamine (2.2?mg?kg?1) and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. The ponies were ventilated to maintain eucapnia. After 90?minutes (=T0), enoximone alone (0.5?mg?kg?1) (E) or enoximone, followed by a constant rate infusion of dobutamine (0.5??g?kg?1?minute?1) (ED) for 120?minutes, was administered. Each pony received both treatments in a crossover trial, with at least 2?weeks between treatments. Heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), right atrial (RAP), systolic (SAP), diastolic (DAP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP), blood gases, systemic vascular resistance (SVR), oxygen delivery (D?O2) and several respiratory gas exchange variables were measured before treatment and until T120. Statistical analysis was based on a mixed model with treatment, time and their interaction as fixed categorical effects, pony as random effect, comparing treatments globally (α?=?0.05) and at specific timepoints (Bonferroni-adjusted α?=?0.00625). Results? Compared to enoximone alone, ED treatment produced an increase in HR, CO, SV, RAP, SAP, DAP, MAP, packed cell volume (PCV) and D?O2. The difference was significant from T60 to T120 (except at T80) for HR, throughout the observational period for CO, SAP, MAP, PCV and D?O2, from T40 to T120 for DAP, at T10,T60,T80 and T120 for SV and at T10 and T20 for RAP. Overall decreases occurred in SVR and dead space ventilation (VD/VT). VD/VT was lower at T20 and from T80 to T120. Venous oxygen saturation was increased from T60 onwards. Conclusions and clinical relevance? The results suggest that enoximone and dobutamine have additive cardiovascular effects and reduce VD/VT in isoflurane-anaesthetized ponies.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this investigation was to quantify the discolouration of tooth roots caused by various medicaments and sealers. The roots of extracted teeth were chemo-mechanically prepared and the smear layer removed. The roots were filled with either Multi-Cal (Pulpdent Corporation, Watertown, MA, USA), Ledermix (Lederle Laboratories, Wolfratshausen, Germany), 2% chlorhexadine acetate in polyethylene glycol (PEG), 5% clindamycin in PEG, PEG alone (as a vehicle control), sealers AH26 (De Trey Dentsply, Zurich, Switzerland), AH Plus (De Trey Dentsply), an experimental epoxy resin with zirconium dioxide (Millenium Chemicals, Rockingham, Western Australia) or Araldite (Selleys Pty Ltd, Sydney, Australia). The roots were maintained at 37°C in dark humid conditions and standardised images of the coronal surfaces recorded over 12?months. Ledermix caused the most darkening of the introduced medicaments, while calcium hydroxide and the materials in PEG did not cause darkening. AH26 caused more darkening than did the other sealers. It was concluded that the use of alternatives to Ledermix and AH26 should be considered when aesthetics are important.
