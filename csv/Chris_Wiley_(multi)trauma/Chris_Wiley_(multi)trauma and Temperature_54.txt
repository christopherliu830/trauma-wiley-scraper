AB  - Abstract Objective To assess the advantages and disadvantages of implementation of published practice guidelines? advocating administration of antibiotics to children aged 3?36 months having high fever without apparent focus of infection. Method Studies were identified by Medline search, index search of major paediatric journals, The Cochrane Library, Emergency Medicine Abstracts and from citations in review articles. All relevant studies were included. Results The Practice Guidelines1 are based on consensus of expert opinion and not based solely on evidence. The conclusions of meta-analyses supporting the Guidelines were not confirmed by subsequent large randomised controlled clinical trials. Original studies and reviews interpreted data in a manner that exaggerated the proposed benefit of giving ceftriaxone. Areas not adequately addressed in the Guidelines are the importance and value of clinical evaluation, adverse effects of intervention, antibiotic resistance, applicability to children vaccinated against H. influenzae type b, applicability to racial groups at lower risk of S. pneumoniae infection and meningitis than the study population, cost, patient acceptance of interventions and treatment advocated, and outcome rather than incidence of focal infection and meningitis. Conclusions Available evidence does not indicate a convincing benefit from giving parenteral or oral antibiotics empirically compared to no antibiotic for children aged 3?36 months presenting with high fever without apparent source. Novel approaches to better quantify risk of adverse outcome in a heterogeneous population at risk of serious infection are discussed.

AB  - SUMMARY Based on experience of 16 horses showing spontaneous epistaxis, a description is given of a previously unrecognised disease. An encapsulated haematoma originates in or near the ethmoid labyrinth and gradually expands, first into the nasal cavity and then into the nasopharynx. The principal clinical sign is a slight, persistent, unilateral nasal discharge of blood or bloodstained mucus. Other signs can include respiratory obstruction, coughing, choking and facial swelling. Diagnosis may be confirmed by rhinoscopy, radiography and trephining the paranasal sinuses. Surgical resection of the haematoma and the affected ethmoid labyrinth has been carried out in 13 horses but the lesion has recurred in five. Histologically, the capsule of the haematoma is composed of respiratory epithelium and fibrous tissue, and the stroma contains blood, macrophages, multinucleate giant cells and some fibrous tissue. The cause of this disease is not yet understood. RÉSUMÉ L'étude de seize cas de chevaux montrant un épistaxis spontané, donne l'occasion de décrire une affection jusqu'alors inconnue. Un hématome encapsulé prend naissance soit dans, soit près du labyrinthe ethmoidien. Progressivement cet hématome se développe, d'abord dans la cavité nasale puis dans le naso pharynx. Le signe clinique principal est un léger écoulement nasal unilatéral et persistant composé de sang ou de mucus mêlé de sang. Parmi les autres signes de cette affection, on peut rencontrer ceux d'une obstruction respiratoire, ceux d'une pseudo-obstruction oesophagienne, parfois de l'oedème facial, et parfois de la toux. Le diagnostic peut être confirmé par rhinoscopie, par radiographie, et en trépanant les sinus paranaseaux. La résection chirurgicale de l'hématome et du labyrinthe ethmoidien atteint a été effectuée, mais, dans deux cas sur cinq, on a observé une récidive. D'un point de vue histologique, on a constaté que la capsule de l'hématome est formée d'épithelium respiratoire et de tissu fibreux, le stroma renferme du sang, des macrophages, des cellules géantes multinucléées et du tissu fibreux. La cause de cette maladie n'est pas encore connue. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Aufgrund von Erfahrungen bei 16 Pferden mit spontaner Epistaxis wird eine bisher nicht erkannte Krankheit beschrieben. Ein abgekapseltes Haematom entsteht im oder nahe am Ethmoid und breitet sich zuerst in die Nasenhöhle später dann in den Nasopharynx aus. Das hervorstechende klinische Zeichen ist ein leichter, persistierender, unilateraler, blutiger oder blutig-mucöser Nasenausfluss. Daneben können etwa Zeichen einer respiratorischen Obstruktion, Husten, Erstickungsanfälle und Gesichtsanschwellungen beobachtet werden. Die Diagnose kann bestätigt werden durch Rhinoskopie, Röntgen und Trepanation der paranasalen Höhlen. Die Resektion des Haematoms und des affizierten ethmoidalen Labyrinths wurde durchgeführt, aber bei zwei Fünftel der Patienten stellte sich ein Recidiv ein. Histologisch besteht die Haematomkapsel aus respiratorischem Epithel und fibrösem Gewebe und das Stroma enthält Blut, Makrophagen, multinukleäre Riesenzellen und etwas fibröses Gewebe. Die Ursache der Krankheit ist noch unbekannt.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the pathophysiology, diagnosis, current treatment, and prognosis of heatstroke. Etiology: Heatstroke can be a life-threatening condition occurring because of an imbalance of heat dissipation and production. Certain factors may predispose some animals to heatstroke. The pathophysiology and sequelae of heatstroke share similarities with that of sepsis; thus, multiple organ dysfunction often ensues. The pathophysiological derangements that occur with heatstroke result from a complex series of events associated with direct cytotoxicity of heat and initiation of the acute-phase response by endotoxin, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines. Activation of endothelial cells, coagulation factors, and fibrinolysis (with ensuing microvascular thrombosis) leads to hypoxia and organ dysfunction. Heat shock proteins produced secondary to sudden heating act as protein chaperones or molecular guardians to provide protection against future heatstroke and may be implicated as a possible genetic component of heatstroke. Diagnosis: A history of recent exercise or being confined in a hot and/or humid environment, combined with clinical signs such as body temperature above 40°C (104°F), panting, tachycardia, hyperemia, dry mucous membranes, and depression to prostration is consistent with a diagnosis of heatstroke. A complete blood count performed during the initial examination of dogs with suspected heatstroke often includes nucleated red blood cells. Therapy: The mainstays for treating heatstroke include rapid evaporative cooling, volume replacement to provide cardiovascular support, and management of secondary complications. Prognosis: The prognosis is multifactorial. There is a significant negative correlation between comatose mental status, decreased temperature, and hypoglycemia with mortality.

AB  - Sinonasal aspergillosis is an uncommon, yet debilitating and often frustrating condition to treat in dogs despite years of research evaluating pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment. The disease is most commonly caused by non-invasive fungal infection, thought to be secondary to altered innate and/or adaptive immune responses. Attempts to confirm this have however failed. A variety of conflicting opinions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of sinonasal aspergillosis exist. Often the use of a particular treatment protocol is based upon personal or regional preference. Evaluation of the veterinary literature demonstrates that the evidence base in support of individual treatment recommendations is weak. A number of recent publications have helped to expand the current knowledge base and therefore our understanding of important practicalities for both diagnostic options and treatment protocols. The following review examines the current evidence for the pathogenesis of sinonasal aspergillosis in dogs, as well as the various diagnostic options. The available evidence for frequently utilised -therapeutic options and their likely outcomes is also explored.

AB  - The radiotracer, [18F]-THK-5351, is a highly selective and high-binding affinity PET imaging agent for aggregates of hyper-phosphorylated tau protein. Our report is a simplified 1-pot, 2-step radiosynthesis of [18F]-THK-5351. This report is broadly applicable for routine clinical production and multi-center trials on account of favorable half-life of flourine-18 and the use of a commercially available radiosynthesis module, the GE TRACERlab? FXFN. First, the O-THP protected tosyl precursor underwent nucleophilic fluorinating reaction with potassium cryptand fluoride ([18F] fluoride (K[18F]/K222)) in Dimethyl sulfoxide at 110°C for 10 minutes followed by O-THP removal by using diluted hydrochloric acid (HCl) at same temperature. [18F]-THK-5351 was purified via semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography and formulated by using 10% EtOH, United States Pharmacopeia (USP) in 0.9% sodium chloride for injection, USP and an uncorrected radiochemical yield of 21 ± 3.5%, with a specific activity of 153.11 ± 25.9 GBq/?mol (4138 ± 700 mCi/?mol) at the end of synthesis (63 minutes; n = 3).

AB  - Abstract Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rapidly progressive soft tissue infection with high morbidity and mortality rates. Its occurrence in the head and neck region is uncommon, the majority of reported cases being limited to involvement of the neck, usually from infections of dental or pharyngeal origin. Involvement of the face from NF is rare; only 35 such cases have been reported in the literature since 1960. It is not only associated with a high mortality but can also result in severe disfigurement of the face, posing challenging reconstructive problems. Successful management of facial NF requires early diagnosis, prompt institution of broad spectrum antibiotics, aggressive surgical debridement to control the infection, and reconstruction of the resultant soft tissue defects. This report describes four additional cases of facial necrotizing fasciitis. One of the four patients died as a result of sepsis and multi-organ system failure. Two of the three surviving patients had significant facial disfigurement. A comprehensive review of the facial NF cases reported in the literature is also provided. Based on our experience with facial NF and the results of all previous case reports, the clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, and management of this disease are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Objective? Enoximone is a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor frequently used to improve cardiac output (CO) in man. As the use of enoximone has not been reported in horses, the effects of this inodilator were examined in isoflurane anaesthetized ponies. Study design? Prospective, randomised, experimental study. Animals? Six healthy ponies, weighing 286 (212?367)?±?52?kg, aged 5.0?±?1.6?years (4?6.5). Methods? After sedation with romifidine [80??g?kg?1 intravenously (IV)], general anaesthesia was induced with midazolam (0.06?mg?kg?1 IV) and ketamine (2.2?mg?kg?1 IV) and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen (Et Iso 1.7%). The ponies were ventilated to maintain eucapnia (PaCO2 4.66?6.00?kPa). Each pony was anaesthetized twice with an interval of 3?weeks; receiving enoximone 0.5?mg?kg?1 IV (E) or saline (S) 90?minutes post-induction. Heart rate (HR), arterial (AP) and right atrial pressure (RAP) were measured before treatment, every 5?minutes between T0 (treatment) and T30 and then every 10?minutes until T120. Cardiac output measurements (lithium dilution technique) and blood gas analysis (arterial and central venous samples) were performed before T0 and at T5, T10, T20, T40, T60, T80, T100 and T120. Stroke volume (SV), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), venous admixture (Q?s/Q?t) and oxygen delivery (?O2) were calculated. Results? Enoximone induced significant increases in HR, CO, SV, Q?s/Q?t and ?O2 and a significant decrease in RAP. No significant differences were detected for AP, SVR and blood gases. No cardiac arrhythmias or other side effects were observed. Conclusions and clinical relevance? The present results suggest that in isoflurane anaesthetized ponies, enoximone has beneficial effects on CO and SV without producing significant changes in blood pressure. Despite an increase in Q?s/Q?t, ?O2 to the tissues was improved.

Method In our review, 21 studies from 1986 to 2011 (12 retrospective studies, eight prospective studies, and a multi-institutional study) including 44,693 pediatric cardiac patients were analyzed. Results and Conclusion Younger age, malnutrition, preoperative respiratory tract infection, high American anesthesiology score, longer duration of surgery, prolonged ventilation, and ICU stay were definite risk factors for mediastinitis. Early primary closure over drains, vacuum-assisted closure, muscle flap, and omental flap remain the most frequently performed treatments for post-sternotomy mediastinitis. Vacuum-assisted closure has emerged as the technique of choice in recent years. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12243 (J Card Surg 2014;29:74-82)

AB  - Abstract Skeletal tissue regeneration is often required following trauma, where substantial bone or cartilage loss may be encountered and is a significant driver for the development of biomaterials with a defined 3D structural network. Solvent blending is a process that avoids complications associated with conventional thermal or mechanical polymer blending or synthesis, opening up large areas of chemical and physical space, while potentially simplifying regulatory pathways towards in vivo application. Here ternary mixtures of natural and synthetic polymers were solvent blended and evaluated as potential bone tissue engineering matrices for osteoregeneration by the assessment of growth and differentiation of STRO-1+ skeletal stem cells. Several of the blend materials were found to be excellent supports for human bone marrow-derived STRO-1+ skeletal cells and fetal skeletal cells, with the optimized blend exhibiting in vivo osteogenic potential, suggesting that these polymer blends could act as suitable matrices for bioengineering of hard tissues.

AB  - Introduction: Antibiotic resistance develops in human patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with increased duration of stay. The major selection factor is the use of antimicrobial agents. The hypothesis tested in this study was that antimicrobial resistance in fecal E. coli isolated from dogs increased with increased length of stay in the ICU. Methods: E. coli were isolated from rectal swabs collected on days 0 (D0, day of admission to the ICU), 3 (D3), 6 (D6), and 9 (D9) from all dogs housed in the ICU for 3 or more days. The E. coli were tested for resistance to nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Thirty-two patients were included in the study, 17 with D0-D3 and 15 with D0-D6 E. coli isolates. Five E. coli strains were isolated each sampling day and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, resulting in a total of 60 outcomes per day per dog. The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) was calculated for each day up to D6. Univariate ANOVA analysis was used to analyze the data. Results: The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) increased from 9.3% on D0 to 14.7% on D3 to 27.9% on D6. Resistance to the frequently used ampicillin increased in a linear manner with increased duration of stay. The proportion of ampicillin-resistant colonies increased from 19.6% on D0 to 39.1% on D3 to 68.7% on D6 (p=0.001). Resistance to the infrequently used amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, also increased significantly (p=0.026) and linearly. The increase in resistance to enrofloxacin was significant (p=0.046); but the increase in resistance to the precursor, nalidixic acid, was highly significant (p=0.020). No change in resistance to gentamicin was found. The remaining antibiotics tested showed an insignificant increase in resistance. Conclusions: Resistance to antibiotics increased in dogs with duration of stay in the ICU for 3 or more days. This linear trend was most significant with penicillin-based beta-lactams, which are frequently used in the ICU. Consequently, critically ill dogs may be at increased risk for developing opportunistic infections, caused by multi-drug resistant organisms.

AB  - SUMMARY Over a 5-year period (1988?92), von Willebrand factor antigen (vWf:Ag) concentrations were determined on plasma samples from 614 Dobermanns. The vWf:Ag concentration was < 50 canine units (CU)/dL in 373 dogs (61%); these dogs were classified as carriers of the von Willebrand's disease (vWD) gene. In order to identify which dogs were at risk of haemorrhage due to vWD, we determined a cut-off vWf:Ag concentration below which dogs could be considered at risk. This cut-off was chosen in order to minimise the number of dogs genuinely at risk of haemorrhage, being wrongly classified as not at risk. This was done without sacrificing the specificity of the cut-off to any great extent. A vWf:Ag concentration of < 36 CU/dL was empirically chosen as the optimum cut-off concentration. In 282 dogs (76% of the carriers), the vWf:Ag concentration was below this cut-off and these dogs were, thus, classified as being at risk of haemorrhage due to vWD. Haemorrhage attributable to vWD was seen in 107 dogs (29% of the carriers, or 17% of all the dogs). Haemorrhage mostly followed trauma or surgery, but spontaneous genitourinary and gastrointestinal haemorrhages were also frequent. Of these dogs, 92 were of known age, with a median of 3 years, and 102 were of known sex, with 61% being female. In 89 dogs in which the severity of haemorrhage was subjectively assessed, mild and moderate bleeding occurred with similar frequency (48% and 43%, respectively). There were 8 cases of severe haemorrhage, with two deaths. The likelihood of haemorrhage was related to the vWf:Ag concentration: only 8% of 91 dogs with concentrations between 36 and 49 CU/dL had haemorrhage attributable to vWD, but 36% with concentrations < 36 CU/dL did so. Furthermore, dogs with haemorrhage attributable to vWD had significantly (P < 0.001) lower vWf:Ag concentrations (median 12 CU/dL, n = 107) than dogs with no such history (median 30 CU/dL, n = 132). The data indicate that vWD is a significant problem in the Dobermann breed in Australia and we accordingly recommend that steps be taken to reduce its prevalence, such as the establishment of a national testing scheme to determine the vWD status of all dogs used for breeding.

AB  - This is the author's fifth revision of a geriatrics bibliography. Approximately one-third of the previous references have been replaced by more current or more delimited articles. Because the literature pertinent to geriatrics has continued to grow ever more rapidly, it has been necessary to omit many informative articles from the bibliography. Preference is given to recent publications; almost all of the references date from the past four years. Some articles were selected to highlight current controversies or changes in viewpoint. Most of the references deal specifically with an elderly patient population, though few use a multidisciplinary approach. Studies of the elderly are confounded by concomitants of aging frequent but not universal in our society: inactivity, obesity, malnutrition, and psychosocial trauma. The articles cited are primarily concerned with medical ailments of the elderly; legal, ethical, and sociological topics receive more limited coverage. The references are divided into categories. The first set (I) deals with some possible causes of aging; the second (II) with physiologic decline accompanying aging; the third (III) with the atypical and nonspecific characteristics of illness among geriatric patients; the fourth (IV) with the elderly and society; and the fifth (V) with care options. The remainder of the references are cited by pertinent medical specialty. Within each category, references are divided by disease process. Articles are further subgrouped by aspects of those diseases such as evaluation or therapy.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aim Avoiding abdominal incisions is one of the unique features of natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE) surgery. There has been no consensus on whether the avoidance of abdominal incisions can reduce the systemic inflammatory response after NOSE surgery. This study was designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of transanal NOSE, especially the inflammatory response after transanal NOSE versus mini-laparotomy (LAP). Methods A total of 172 colorectal cancer patients who underwent transanal NOSE were matched with 172 patients who underwent LAP for colorectal cancer. Clinical characteristics, pathological features, perioperative parameters, and indicators of the inflammatory response were collected and compared. The inflammatory response was assessed by measuring body temperature, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein levels, and procalcitonin levels. Results Patients in the NOSE group had better short-term outcomes, such as lower incidence of wound infection, less postoperative pain, less need for anesthetic drugs, and faster recovery of intestinal function. Regarding the inflammatory response, the average body temperature of patients in the NOSE group was higher on postoperative day (POD) 2 than that in the LAP group. A higher median neutrophil count and C-reactive protein levels were observed in the NOSE group on POD3 and POD5 than was observed in the LAP group. Conclusions Transanal NOSE is safe and feasible for colorectal cancer, with better short-term outcomes. Although transanal NOSE produced a larger systemic inflammatory response than LAP in the early postoperative stages, this response did not appear to translate into infectious morbidity.

AB  - Abstract Despite a number of clinically available hemostats, uncontrolled bleeding is the primary cause of trauma-related death. Shape-memory polymer (SMP) foams have a number of desirable properties for use as hemostats, including shape recovery to enable delivery into bleed sites, biocompatibility, and rapid blood clotting. To expand upon this material system, the current work aims to incorporate phenolic acids, which are honey-based antimicrobial agents, into SMP foams. We showed that cinnamic acid (CA) can be utilized as a monomer in SMP synthesis to provide foams with comparable pore structure and retained cytocompatibility. The addition of CA enabled tuning of thermal and shape-memory properties within clinically relevant ranges. Furthermore, the modified foams demonstrated initial and sustained antimicrobial effects against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. These multifunctional scaffolds demonstrate potential for use as hemostats to improve upon current hemorrhage treatments and provide a new tool in tuning the biological and material properties of SMP foams.

AB  - Abstract Objective To assess the cardiopulmonary effects of ephedrine and phenylephrine for management of isoflurane-induced hypotension in horses. Study design Prospective randomized clinical study. Animals Fourteen isoflurane-anesthetized horses undergoing digital palmar neurectomy. Methods Ephedrine (EPH group; 0.02 mg kg?1 minute?1; n = 7) or phenylephrine (PHE group; 0.002 mg kg?1 minute?1; n = 7) was administered to all horses when mean arterial pressure (MAP) was <60 mmHg. The infusions were ended when the target MAP was achieved, corresponding to a 50% increase over the pre-infusion MAP (baseline). The horses were instrumented with an arterial catheter to measure blood pressure and allow the collection of blood for pH and blood-gas analysis and a Swan-Ganz catheter for measurement of cardiac output using thermodilution. Cardiopulmonary parameters were recorded at baseline and at 5, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after achieving the target MAP. Results In both groups, the MAP and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) increased significantly at 5, 30, 60 and 90 minutes post infusion compared to baseline (p < 0.05). The EPH group had a significant increase in cardiac index (CI) and systemic oxygen delivery index at 5, 30, 60 and 90 minutes post infusion compared to baseline (p < 0.05) and compared to the PHE group (p < 0.05). The PHE group had significantly higher SVR and no decrease in oxygen extraction compared with the EPH group at 30, 60 and 90 minutes post infusion (p < 0.05). No significant differences in ventilatory parameters were observed between groups after the infusion. Conclusions Ephedrine increased the MAP by increasing CI and SVR. Phenylephrine increased MAP by increasing SVR but cardiac index decreased. Ephedrine resulted in better tissue oxygenation than phenylephrine. Clinical relevance Ephedrine would be preferable to phenylephrine to treat isoflurane-induced hypotension in horses since it increases blood flow and pressure.

AB  - Aim: To compare intrapleural streptokinase and placebo in paediatric empyema. Methods: Children with empyema greater than stage 5 received intrapleural streptokinase (n= 19) or normal saline (n= 21) along with intercostal drainage. Clinical and serial sonographic outcomes were compared. Results: Although there was no difference in clinical and sonographic outcome, none of the children with stage 7 empyema (multi-loculated empyema) who received streptokinase developed pleural thickening 30 d later. Conclusion: There is no short-term clinical benefit of intrapleural streptokinase in paediatric empyema; this therapy may be reserved for those with stage 7 empyema to prevent pleural thickening in the long term.

AB  - Summary New developments in therapy for foals in respiratory distress are discussed. Therapy is based on preservation of the foal's life by maintenance of a patent airway, resuscitation with fluids and warmth, provision of humidified oxygen to raise the fractional concentration of inspired oxygen sufficient to avoid hypoxia and provision of ventilatory support when hypercapnia becomes critical. Ventilatory support described includes assisted and controlled ventilation, positive end expiratory pressure, continuous positive airway pressure and intermittent mandatory ventilation. The aims of these techniques are discussed together with their associated indications, disadvantages and complications. Secondary therapy includes coupage, airway hygiene, drug therapy and stress management. Knowledge of equine neonatology is limited in comparison with human neonatology. More information in basic physiology and pharmacology relating to equine neonatology is needed and the efficacy of various modes of therapy must be evaluated.

AB  - Cardiac surgery continues to be associated with excessive perioperative bleeding due to poorly characterised haemostatic changes associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and the trauma of major surgery. Blood component support varies between institutions and the recent introduction of recombinant VIIa promises to improve perioperative haemostasis, albeit at significant expense. Prothrombin complex concentrates (ProthrombinexTM-HT(PTX), CSL Australia) are utilised increasingly to correct excessive oral anticoagulation and have a number of advantages over FFP including greater coagulation factor concentration (particularly IX), reduced product volume and viral inactivation. There is no data on the use of PCCs in cardiac surgery. During a 6?month period (February ? August 2003), 203 patients underwent cardiac surgery at Barwon Health of whom 60 received PTX during the intra-operative or post-operative period (45 M, 15 F; Mean age 68.7?years). 28 (47%) patients underwent simple procedures (either valvular or graft surgery alone) while the remaining 32 (53%) patients had complex surgery (emergency cases, graft/valves, double valves, Bentall?s or redos). PTX was employed following the use of standard blood component support when there was evidence of persistent bleeding and abnormal laboratory coagulation studies. 20 patients intra-operatively and 34 patients post-op required no PTX. The mean dose of PTX administered intra-operatively was 595?U (range 500?2000?U) and 240?U post-operatively (range 500?1000). PTX use was associated with documented improvements in bleeding and coagulation studies; mean INRs and APTTs pre- & post- PTX 1.7?>?1.3 and 65?s?>?52s respectively. 33 (55%) patients were evaluated at 3?months through their physicians for evidence of prothrombotic sequelae. 8 patients were noted to have had potential prothrombotic complications (4 myocardial ischaemia, 1 pulmonary embolus, 1 CVA and 2 thrombophlebitis). Conclusion? On the basis of this small study, PTX is a useful adjunct to standard blood component support in cardiac surgery and may defer the use of rVIIa in this setting.
