AB  - Abstract Background and Aim Avoiding abdominal incisions is one of the unique features of natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE) surgery. There has been no consensus on whether the avoidance of abdominal incisions can reduce the systemic inflammatory response after NOSE surgery. This study was designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of transanal NOSE, especially the inflammatory response after transanal NOSE versus mini-laparotomy (LAP). Methods A total of 172 colorectal cancer patients who underwent transanal NOSE were matched with 172 patients who underwent LAP for colorectal cancer. Clinical characteristics, pathological features, perioperative parameters, and indicators of the inflammatory response were collected and compared. The inflammatory response was assessed by measuring body temperature, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein levels, and procalcitonin levels. Results Patients in the NOSE group had better short-term outcomes, such as lower incidence of wound infection, less postoperative pain, less need for anesthetic drugs, and faster recovery of intestinal function. Regarding the inflammatory response, the average body temperature of patients in the NOSE group was higher on postoperative day (POD) 2 than that in the LAP group. A higher median neutrophil count and C-reactive protein levels were observed in the NOSE group on POD3 and POD5 than was observed in the LAP group. Conclusions Transanal NOSE is safe and feasible for colorectal cancer, with better short-term outcomes. Although transanal NOSE produced a larger systemic inflammatory response than LAP in the early postoperative stages, this response did not appear to translate into infectious morbidity.

AB  - Summary New developments in therapy for foals in respiratory distress are discussed. Therapy is based on preservation of the foal's life by maintenance of a patent airway, resuscitation with fluids and warmth, provision of humidified oxygen to raise the fractional concentration of inspired oxygen sufficient to avoid hypoxia and provision of ventilatory support when hypercapnia becomes critical. Ventilatory support described includes assisted and controlled ventilation, positive end expiratory pressure, continuous positive airway pressure and intermittent mandatory ventilation. The aims of these techniques are discussed together with their associated indications, disadvantages and complications. Secondary therapy includes coupage, airway hygiene, drug therapy and stress management. Knowledge of equine neonatology is limited in comparison with human neonatology. More information in basic physiology and pharmacology relating to equine neonatology is needed and the efficacy of various modes of therapy must be evaluated.

AB  - Abstract Objectives? To evaluate the effectiveness of parenting interventions in preventing unintentional injury and increasing parental safety practices. Data sources? A range of medical and social science electronic databases were searched. Abstracts from the first to seventh World conferences on injury prevention and control and the journal Injury Prevention were hand searched. Review methods? Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized controlled trials (non-RCTs) and controlled before and after studies, providing parenting interventions to parents of children aged 0?18?years and reporting injuries, safety equipment or safety practices were included. Studies were selected, data extracted and quality appraised independently by two reviewers. Pooled relative risks were estimated using random effect models. Results? Fifteen studies (11 RCTs) were included, 11 of which were home visiting programmes and two of which were paediatric practice-based interventions. Thirteen studies recruited families at risk of adverse child health outcomes. Intervention arm families had a significantly lower risk of injury (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71?0.95), as measured by self-report of medically or non-medically attended injury. Several studies found fewer home hazards, a home environment more conducive to child safety, or a greater number of safety practices in intervention arm families. Conclusions? Parenting interventions, most commonly provided within the home, using multi-faceted interventions appear to be effective in reducing unintentional child injury. Further research is required to explore the mechanisms by which parenting interventions reduce injury, the features of interventions that are necessary to reduce injury, and their generalizability to different population groups.

AB  - Summary Systematic reviews are an important component of knowledge synthesis, knowledge translation and evidence-based emergency medicine. They are also important designs for clinicians to understand, apply and perhaps use to generate early research results. Systematic reviews, however, are not all created equally and major flaws in the production of a systematic review may create misleading results. Even worse, applying evidence from poorly performed systematic reviews may delay more appropriate care, increase costs, and/or harm patients. Outlined in this chapter are the important steps in the conduct of a high quality systematic review that protect against publication and selection bias, employ novel quality assessment strategies, and address the issue of data synthesis and heterogeneity. The goal of this work is to alert clinicians to red flags or fatal flaws when evaluating systematic reviews as well as encourage your researchers to consider this design in early research endeavors.

AB  - ABSTRACT The California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) population in the United States has increased steadily since the early 1970s. The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA) established criteria for management of marine mammals based on the concept of managing populations within the optimal sustainable population (OSP), defined as a range of abundance from the maximum net productivity level (MNPL) to carrying capacity (K). Recent declines in California sea lion pup production and survival suggest that the population may have stopped growing, but the status of the population relative to OSP and MNPL is unknown. We used a time series of pup counts from 1975 to 2014 and a time series of mark-release-resight-recovery data from 1987 to 2015 for survival estimates to numerically reconstruct the population and evaluate the current population status relative to OSP using a generalized logistic model. We demonstrated that the population size in 2014 was above MNPL and within its OSP range. However, we also showed that population growth can be dramatically decreased by increasing sea surface temperature associated with El Ni√±o events or similar regional ocean temperature anomalies. In this analysis we developed a critical tool for management of California sea lions that provides a better understanding of the population dynamics and a scientific foundation upon which to base management decisions related to complex resource issues involving this species. Published 2018. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.

AB  - Objective To investigate whether preoperative methadone provides superior perioperative analgesia compared to buprenorphine in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Methods Eighty female dogs were recruited to an assessor-blinded, randomised, clinical trial. Dogs received a premedication dose of 0¬∑05?mg/kg acepromazine or 10¬†?g/kg medetomidine combined with either 0¬∑3¬†mg/kg methadone or 20??g/kg buprenorphine intramuscularly. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with isoflurane. Pain was assessed using two scoring schemes (a dynamic interactive visual analogue scale and the short form of the Glasgow Composite Pain Scale) before premedication, 30?minutes later and every hour for 8¬†hours after premedication. If indicated, rescue analgesia was provided with methadone. Meloxicam was administered after the final assessment. The area under the curve for change in pain scores over time and the requirement for rescue analgesia were compared between groups. Results Groups premedicated with buprenorphine had significantly higher pain scores than those premedicated with methadone. There was no interaction between opioid and sedative for any outcome measure. Rescue analgesia was required by significantly more dogs premedicated with buprenorphine (45%) than that of methadone (20%). Clinical Significance At the doses investigated, methadone produced superior postoperative analgesia compared to buprenorphine in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy.

AB  - Wearable or attachable health monitoring smart systems are considered to be the next generation of personal portable devices for remote medicine practices. Smart flexible sensing electronics are components crucial in endowing health monitoring systems with the capability of real-time tracking of physiological signals. These signals are closely associated with body conditions, such as heart rate, wrist pulse, body temperature, blood/intraocular pressure and blood/sweat bio-information. Monitoring such physiological signals provides a convenient and non-invasive way for disease diagnoses and health assessments. This Review summarizes the recent progress of flexible sensing electronics for their use in wearable/attachable health monitoring systems. Meanwhile, we present an overview of different materials and configurations for flexible sensors, including piezo-resistive, piezo-electrical, capacitive, and field effect transistor based devices, and analyze the working principles in monitoring physiological signals. In addition, the future perspectives of wearable healthcare systems and the technical demands on their commercialization are briefly discussed.

AB  - Introduction:? Electric fields of the magnitude likely to occur in electrical injury can result in skeletal muscle electroporation. It has been reported that Poloxamer 188 (P188) is able to seal damaged cell membranes. Using a previously described rat hind limb model of electrical injury, in this study we employ MRI to demonstrate that intravenously administered P188 arrests muscle tissue edema caused by electrical shock. Methods:? Anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rat hindlimbs were subjected to 12 electrical shock pulses of 2?kV and ?2A amplitude with duration of 4?ms. There was a 10-second separation period between shocks to allow thermal relaxation. Animals received either P188 or Lactated Ringer?s Injection (control) intravenously at 60 minutes after shock. Proton MRI were recorded using a 4.7-Tesla Bruker scanner (200?MHz). A Multi-Slice Multi-Echo (MSME) spin echo sequence was used to obtain T2-weighted images. Ten slices over the entire midthigh region were taken. For each slice, images from 10 echos in the TE range of 10?ms?100?ms and TR?=?2000?ms were collected. Imaging began at 60 minutes and continued until 3 hours postshock. The signal intensities at different TE times were used to fit an exponential decay and measure the T2 value in each voxel. Voxels with T2 values?>?80?ms were considered injured. Results:? There were noticeable increases of injured area with time for electrically injured limbs due to development of edema. Control-treated rats averaged a 58.0%(¬±6.59% SD) increase in total area of injury. The total area of injury for P188-treated rats increased by 46.6%(¬±2.96% SD) In nonelectroporation limbs, no change in T2 occurred. Discussion:? Disruption of the plasma membrane due to electrical current leads to edema. We treated the injured muscles with P188 and observed that it helped to arrest edema. MRI proved effective not only in characterizing the degree of injury resulting from electrical shock but also in monitoring therapeutic efficacy.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?Circulating endothelial cells (CECs) have been identified as markers of vascular damage in a variety of disorders, such as myocardial infarction, vasculitis, and transplantation. CD146-driven immunomagnetic isolation has gained widespread use, but the technique is hampered by the lack of a definition of CECs and the absence of a consensus for their enumeration. Aim:?To evaluate several variables influencing immunomagnetic isolation of CECs, formulate a definition for CECs and propose a consensus protocol for their enumeration. Methods:?We devised a protocol based on CD146-driven immunomagnetic isolation and a subsequent confirmatory step with Ulex-Europaeus-Lectin-1 staining. In a multi-center effort, we evaluated the preanalytical and analytical phases of this protocol. We evaluated the effects of storage, anticoagulation and density centrifugation, and compiled previous experience with this technique. Results:?Our protocol permitted unequivocal identification of CECs with acceptable reproducibility. There was an effect of storage time in that median cell numbers declined to only 87.5% of their baseline values during 24?h of storage at 4?¬∞C. Recovery was lower with citrate than with ethylene-diamine tetra-acetic acid after 4?h of storage; density centrifugation was also associated with lower recovery. We provide a comprehensive list of technical recommendations and potential pitfalls. Finally, based on our experience with this protocol and a recent consensus workshop, we formulated a working definition for CECs. Conclusion:?Our work represents an important step toward consensus regarding the CECs. Our recommendations represent the experience of three major centers and should now be scrutinized by others in the field.

AB  - Summary The use of contrast media in computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasing in horses. These contrast-enhanced imaging techniques provide improved tissue delineation and evaluation, thereby expanding diagnostic capabilities. While generally considered safe, not all contrast media exhibit the same safety profiles. The safety of contrast media use and descriptions of adverse events occurring in horses are sparsely reported. This review summarises the reported evidence of contrast media use and adverse events that occur in horses, with added contribution from other veterinary species and studies in man for comparison. This comprehensive data set empowers equine clinicians to develop use and monitoring strategies when working with contrast media. Finally, it summarises the current state-of-the-art and highlights the potential applications of contrast-enhanced CT and MRI for assessment of diseased or injured equine tissues, as well as (patho)physiological processes.

AB  - Summary Safely transporting a critically ill patient requires a coordinated approach. The transport environment is hazardous. Travelling in the rear compartment of a road ambulance or aircraft is fraught with potential danger. Health and safety at work regulations have several specific provisions which are pertinent to the field of transfer medicine. This chapter focuses on safety in the transport environment in terms of: the team, the patient, the carers, the vehicle and equipment, and the organisation. If carers accompany the transport team it is important that they have appropriate clothing and footwear for all eventualities as described above for the staff. When travelling in the ambulance, family must always wear the seatbelt provided. It must be made clear that they must not release it unless the ambulance has come to a halt and the transport team and/or driver instruct them that it is safe to do so.

AB  - Hospital acquired infections (HAI) are a major source of morbidity and mortality in human and veterinary hospitals. Research in human hospitals has shown that well focused staff education is an important step in limiting the development of HAI. Our hospital currently has no training program with respect to HAI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the general knowledge of hospital staff concerning HAI as the first step in developing a hospital wide education program. Ninety doctors and technicians were given a questionnaire containing 15 questions about HAI. The questionnaires were hand distributed and immediately completed. Ten of the questions tested knowledge of HAI, while five questions concerned the individual's perception of HAI in our hospital. Answers were given as a range from strongly agree to strongly disagree or in the form of multiple choice. With respect to their perception of HAI, 66% of technicians and 50% of doctors believed that they possess a good working knowledge of HAI. Several areas for improvement in hospital staff knowledge were identified. Technicians were more likely than doctors to incorrectly believe that 1) routine environmental cultures are effective at preventing HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 30%, doctors 52%), 2) that all animals that aspirated gastric contents under anesthesia develop clinical evidence of pneumonia (percent correct answer: technicians 55%, doctors 84%), and 3) that animals with an indwelling urinary catheter should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics (percent correct answer: technicians 51%, doctors 90%). In addition, doctors were more likely to identify Amikacin as the antibiotic of choice for patients with HAI in our hospital (percent correct answer: technicians 27%, doctors 79%). Neither group was able to adequately identify the patients in the ICU as the primary reservoir for the multi-drug resistant pathogens that cause HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 20%, doctors 15%). The discrepancy in knowledge between the two groups is likely explained by attendance of faculty, residents, and interns at one or more continuing education rounds sessions where HAI were discussed. This finding is contrary to what is frequently found in human hospitals where the nursing staff typically demonstrates superior knowledge of HAI when compared to doctors. The results of this study demonstrate that knowledge of HAI is not optimal in both the doctors and technicians in our hospital. Further better focused efforts are warranted to address the educational shortcomings evidenced by this study.

AB  - Abstract Hypoxic?ischemia injury occurs after trauma causes consequential bone necrosis. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently used in orthopedic clinics for pain relief. However, the underlying mechanism and outcome for usage of NSAIDs is poorly understood. To investigate the damage and loss of osteoblast function in hypoxia, two hypoxia mimetics, cobalt chloride (CoCl2) and desferrioxamine (DFO), were used to create an in vitro hypoxic microenvironment. The cell damage was observed by decreases of cell viability and increases in cyclooxygenase-2 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Cell apoptosis was confirmed by WST-1 cytotoxic assays and flow cytometry. The functional expression of osteoblast in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was significantly decreased by CoCl2 and inhibited when treated with DFO. To simulate the use of NSAID after hypoxic injury, four types of anti-inflammatory drugs, sulindac sulfide (SUL), indomethacin (IND), aspirin (Asp), and sodium salicylate (NaS), were applied to osteoblasts after 1?h of hypoxia mimetic treatment. SUL and IND further enhanced cell death after hypoxia. ALP activity was totally abolished in hypoxic osteoblasts under IND treatment. Facilitation of osteoblast apoptosis occurred regardless of IND dosage under hypoxic conditions. To investigate osteoblast in vivo, local hypoxia was created by fracture of tibia and then treated the injured mice with IND by oral feeding. IND-induced osteoblast apoptosis was confirmed by positive staining of TUNEL assay in fractured mice. Significant delay of fracture healing in bone tissue was also observed with the treatment of IND. These results provide information pertaining to choosing appropriate anti-inflammatory drugs for orthopedic patients. J. Cell. Biochem. 113: 148?155, 2012. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Background Decline in high speed treadmill (HSTM) exercise testing may be attributed to the rise of over-ground endoscopy and telemetric electrocardiography, in addition to concerns of adverse events during treadmill exercise resulting in injury or inadequate testing. Objectives To describe adverse events occurring during HSTM exercise tests at a single institution and determine their effect on likelihood of completing diagnostic HSTM exercise testing. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods Pearson?s chi-square test was used to determine if a significant difference in frequencies of adverse events existed between complete and incomplete HSTM exercise tests. Two Firth logistic regression models were used to determine likelihood of exercise test completion given the presence of any adverse event, and the likelihood of exercise test completion for each type of adverse event. Results The majority of horses presenting for HSTM evaluation underwent exercise testing (900/1003; 90%). Eight-hundred and seven (90%) exercise tests were completed. Adverse events occurred in 136 (15%) HSTM exercise tests of which 97 (71%) did not impact ability to complete HSTM testing. Adverse events significantly but variably decreased the likelihood of HSTM exercise test completion. Sixty-six percent of incomplete exercise tests were prematurely terminated due to poor performance abnormalities during which diagnosis of poor performance cause(s) was still achieved. Main limitations Variable personnel recorded data over the study period. Per-test rather than per-horse evaluation does not account for the effect of multiple training and testing episodes performed in the same horse. Conclusions This study supports the continued usage of HSTM exercise testing for examination of horses with poor performance, with adverse events occurring infrequently. Adverse events reduced the likelihood of completing HSTM exercise testing although not all adverse events affected likelihood of completion similarly. In many cases, a performance limiting problem was identified for horses in which an exercise test was considered incomplete. The Summary is available in Spanish ? see Supporting information
