AB  - Abstract Even mildly hypothermic body or limb temperatures can retard healing processes in mammals. Despite this, we observed that hibernating American black bears (Ursus americanus Pallas, 1780) elicit profound abilities in mounting inflammatory responses to infection and/or foreign bodies. In addition, they resolve injuries during hibernation while maintaining mildly hypothermic states (30?35 °C) and without eating, drinking, urinating or defecating. We describe experimental studies on free-ranging bears that document their abilities to completely resolve cutaneous cuts and punctures incurred during or prior to hibernation. We induced small, full-thickness cutaneous wounds (biopsies or incisions) during early denning, and re-biopsied sites 2?3 months later (near the end of denning). Routine histological methods were used to characterize these skin samples. All biopsied sites with respect to secondary intention (open circular biopsies) and primary intention (sutured sites) healed, with evidence of initial eschar (scab) formation, completeness of healed epidermis and dermal layers, dyskeratosis (inclusion cysts), and abilities to produce hair follicles. These healing abilities of hibernating black bears are a clear survival advantage to animals injured before or during denning. Bears are known to have elevated levels of hibernation induction trigger (delta-opioid receptor agonist) and ursodeoxycholic acid (major bile acid within plasma, mostly conjugated with taurine) during hibernation, which may relate to these wound-healing abilities. Further research as to the underlying mechanisms of wound healing during hibernation could have applications in human medicine. Unique approaches may be found to improve healing for malnourished, hypothermic, diabetic and elderly patients or to reduce scarring associated with burns and traumatic injuries.

AB  - Objective To investigate the ability of shape memory Dacron polymer vascular coils to induce the complete, gradual occlusion of the canine jugular vein. Study Design Observational pilot study. Animals Nine purpose-bred dogs. Methods Eighteen coils were deployed in nine dogs using fluoroscopic-guided percutaneous transvenous coil implantation. Individual coil formulations varied around a Dacron polymer base. Jugular vein diameter, percent vessel occlusion, and thrombus echogenicity were monitored at weekly intervals using ultrasonography. Affected jugular veins were harvested at 6 weeks post-implantation and histopathological analysis was performed to assess adventitial fibrosis, intimal layer thickening, and inflammation. Results Ten coils migrated from the jugular veins to the pulmonary vasculature within 0?2 weeks following implantation. Three jugular veins achieved at least 90% occlusion at six weeks. Histopathology of these jugular veins revealed marked perivascular thickening and fibrovascular proliferation, increased infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes, and abundant fibroplasia. Conclusions Complete, gradual occlusion of a jugular vein was achieved in three dogs. Significant vessel wall reaction and inflammation can induce gradual vessel occlusion when a Dacron coil remains implanted within the jugular vein. Dacron polymer coils could be a feasible treatment option for the gradual occlusion of congenital portosystemic shunts in dogs using minimally invasive, percutaneous transvenous implantation.

AB  - With the improved accessibility to ultrasound, fine needle aspiration of abdominal organs is now performed frequently in many veterinary practices. Despite this, there are many ?unknowns? as to the best method to produce a high-quality sample. This report begins by highlighting recent literature on the risks and benefits of abdominal fine needle aspiration. It follows with recommendations about the equipment and method best suited to the procedure, including needle and syringe size and aspiration versus non-aspiration techniques. Various smear preparations and laboratory submission requirements are also discussed. The final aspect of the review more specifically discusses fine needle aspiration of specific abdominal organs: the liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas, urinary bladder, prostate and abdominal lymph nodes.

AB  - SUMMARY Parenteral magnesium sulfate has been used to control acute convulsions of diverse etiologies and is currently a mainstay in controlling eclamptic convulsions. However, the site of this anticonvulsant action has remained controversial and not well studied in experimental epileptic models. Therefore we determined the effects of intravenously infused magnesium sulfate on the epileptic neural activity induced by topical application of penicillin G to motor cortex in anesthetized cats and dogs and in awake, undrugged primates. Magnesium sulfate was able to directly suppress neuronal burst firing and interictal EEG spike generation at serum levels below those producing paralysis. The degree of suppression corresponded to the serum magnesium concentration and was reversible. These results corroborate the clinical observations in patients that magnesium can produce an anticonvulsant effect apart from neuromuscular blockade and suggest it may have clinical applicability in treating a wider range of acute convulsions. RÉSUMÉ Les injections parentérales de sulfate de magnésium ont de utilisées pour le traitement d'états convulsifs d'étiologies diverses et sont encore couramment utilisées pour le traitement des convulsions éclamptiques. Cependant le lieu de Taction anticonvulsivante de ce produit est encore L'objet de discussions et n'a pas de bien étudié du point de vue expérimental. Les auteurs ont done déterminé les effets d'une perfusion intra-veineuse de sulfate de magnesium sur L'activitéépileptique provoquée par L'application de pénicilline G sur le cortex moteur de chats et de chiens anesthesies et de primates eveilles. Le sulfate de magnesium s'est revele capable de supprimer directement les decharges neuroniques et les pointes intercritiques sur L'EEG pour des taux seriques inferieurs a ceux entrainant la paralysie. Le degré de suppression correspond àa la concentration sérique du magnésium et la suppression est réversible. de tels résultats corroborent les observations cliniques suivant lesquelles le magnesium petit avoir un effet antiepileptique en dehors d'un blocage neuromusculaire et ils suggàerent que ce produit pour-rait être utilisé pour le traitement d'un large éventail d'états convulsifs aigus. RESUMEN El sulfato de magnesio por via parenteral se ha usado para control de las convulsiones agudas de diversas etiologías y todavía constituye una medicación de elección en el control de las convulsiones eclampsicas. A pesar de todo, el lugar de su acción anticonvulsiva permanece bajo controversia y no se ha estudiado bien en modelos epilépticos experimen-tales. Por esta raz6n hemos determinado los efectos de la inyección endovenosa de sulfato magnésico sobre la actividad epileptica neuronal inducida mediante la aplicación táopica de penicilina G en la corteza motora de perros y gatos anestesiados y de primates despiertos y sin medicar. El sulfato magnesico suprimió los brotes de descargas neuronales y la generación de puntas en el electroencefalograma interictal con nive-les sericos inferiores a los que produce paralisis. El grado de supresi6n correspondi6 a la concentración s6rica de magnesio y fue reversible. Estos resultados corroboran las observaciones clinicas en pacientes, de los que se deduce que el magnesio puede producir un efecto anticonvulsivo ajeno al bloqueo neuromuscular y sugieren que puede tener una aplicación clinica en el tratamiento de un amplio espectro de convulsiones agudas. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Parenterale Gaben von Magnesiumsulfat werden genutzt, akut aufgetretene Anfalle unterschiedlicher Atiologie zu kupieren. Gegenwartig ist Magnesiumsulfat eine Hauptstiitze in der Behandlung eklamp-tischer Anfalle. Die Lokalisation seiner antikonvul-siven Wirkung jedoch blieb kontrovers und nicht ausreichend an experimentellen Epilepsiemodellen untersucht. Wir haben daher die Wirkungen intravenos applizierten Magnesiumsulfats auf die epileptische Neuronenaktivitat untersucht, wobei die épilepsie hervorgerufen worden war durch lokale Gabe von Penicillin G an die motorische Rindenregion von anaesthesierten Katzen und Hunden und von wachen, nicht medikamentos vorbehandelten Primaten. Magnesiumsulfat war in der Lage, unmittelbar neuronale Paroxysmen und interictale encephalographische spikes zu unterdriicken bei Serumspiegeln, die unter dem paralysierenden Bereich lagen. Der Grad der Unterdriickung korrespondierte zu der Konzentration von Magnesiumsulfat im Serum und war reversibel. Diese Ergebnisse bestarken die klinischen Beobach-tungen an Patienten, daß Mg einen antikonvulsiven Effekt haben kann abgesehen von neuromuskularer Blockade, und sie lassen annehmen, daß es klinisch anwendbar ist für einen groBeren Teil akuter cerebraler Anfalle.

AB  - Summary The anaesthetic considerations of patients presenting for extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy are described. Regional anaesthesia with sedation may be preferable to general anaesthesia for patients undergoing this form of therapy. If regional anaesthesia is contra-indicated, general anaesthesia using controlled ventilation with muscle relaxation, supplemented with a narcotic and a low concentration of volatile anaesthetic has been found to be a suitable alternative. The additional epidural preparation time has to be balanced against the benefits of easier patient transfer. especially during multi-stage procedures, and better postoperative analgesia. The epidural catheter can be left in situ in patients who require multiple treatments or who may experience severe ureteric pain as the resulting ?sand mass? is passed. Epidural space localisation using a ?loss of resistance to saline? technique is recommended, in order to avoid the possible risk of damage to the spinal cord and emerging nerves (due to the presence of an air-water interface). Patients with cardiac insufficiency need special consideration, in view of the effects of immersion on right and left heart filling pressures.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To describe the ultrasonographic anatomy of the caudal lumbar spine in cats and to detect ultrasound (US) signs associated with epidural or intrathecal injection. Study design Prospective, clinical study. Animals Twenty-six client-owned cats. Methods Transverse (position 1) and parasagittal (position 2) two-dimensional US scanning was performed over the caudal lumbar spine in all cats. Midline distances between the identified structures were measured. Cats assigned to epidural injection (group E, n = 16) were administered a bupivacaine?morphine combination confirmed by electrical stimulation. Cats assigned to intrathecal injection (group I, n = 10) were administered a morphine?iohexol combination injected at the lumbosacral level and confirmed by lateral radiography. The total volume injected (0.3 mL kg?1) was divided into two equal aliquots that were injected without needle repositioning, with the US probe in positions 1 and 2, respectively. The presence or absence of a burst of color [color flow Doppler test (CFDT)], dural sac collapse and epidural space enlargement were registered during and after both injections. Results US scanning allowed measurement of the distances between the highly visible structures inside the spinal canal. CFDT was positive for all animals in group E. In group I, intrathecal injection was confirmed in only two animals, for which the CFDT was negative; seven cats inadvertently and simultaneously were administered an epidural injection and showed a positive CFDT during the second aliquot injection, and the remaining animal was administered epidural anesthesia and was excluded from the CFDT data analysis. Dural sac collapse and epidural space enlargement were present in all animals in which an epidural injection was confirmed. Conclusions and clinical relevance US examination allowed an anatomical description of the caudal lumbar spine and real-time confirmation of epidural injection by observation of a positive CFDT, dural sac collapse and epidural space enlargement.

AB  - Abstract Objective: The aim of the present study was to determine if the quantification of bacterial 16S rDNA could be clinically useful in predicting patients at increased risk of developing septic shock. Methods: A retrospective study of patients with positive blood cultures taken on arrival to the ED. An EDTA sample was collected simultaneously with blood cultures and assayed by polymerase chain reaction to quantitate the bacterial 16S rDNA load. Descriptive and clinical data were collected from the medical record and this was blinded to the 16S rDNA result. Subsequently, the 16S rDNA result was compared with illness severity markers including septic shock and death to determine the relationship between the 16S rDNA load and illness severity. Results: 98 patients (mean age 61 ± 20?years, range 18?92) with positive blood cultures were studied, most commonly growing Escherichia coli (n= 25) and Staphylococcus aureus (n= 23). 16 (16%) died. There were 42 (43%) 16S rDNA positive patients. A high 16S rDNA load was associated with an increased risk of developing delayed septic shock (OR 21.9, 95% CI 2.5?192.6) in comparison with either a low or negative 16S rDNA load; with a mortality OR 4.6 (95% CI 0.9?23.5). Conclusions: The quantitative assay for 16S rDNA might be a useful screening tool to detect severe sepsis in those whom it might not be clinically suspected. However, prospective studies are required to further assess the clinical usefulness of this assay.

AB  - Abstract Background Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes continuous neurological deficits and major sensory-motor impairments. There is no effective treatment to enhance sensory-motor function following SCI. Thus, it is crucial to develop novel therapeutics for this particular patient population. Astaxanthin (AST) is a strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic agent. In the present study, it was tested in a severe compression SCI model with emphasis on sensory-motor outcomes, signalling pathway, along with other complications. Methods A severe SCI was induced by compression of the rat thoracic spinal cord with an aneurysm clip and treatment with AST or the vehicle was carried out, 30 min after injury. Behavioural tests including open field, von Frey, hot plate and BBB were performed weekly to 28 days post-injury. Rats were assigned to measure blood glucose, weight and auricle temperature. Western blot and histological analysis also were performed at the same time points. Results AST decreased mechanical and thermal pain and also improved motor function performance, reduced blood glucose and auricle temperature increases and attenuated weight loss in SCI rats. Western blot analysis showed decreased activation of ERK1/2 and increased activation of AKT following AST treatment. The histology results revealed that AST considerably preserved myelinated white matter and the number of motor neurons following SCI. Conclusion Taken together, the beneficial effects of AST to improve sensory-motor outcomes, attenuate pathological tissue damage and modulate ERK and AKT signalling pathways following SCI, suggest it as a strong therapeutic agent towards clinical applications. Significance Spinal cord injury (SCI) impairs sensory-motor function and causes complications, which astaxanthin (AST) has the potential to be used as a treatment for. The present study investigates the effects of AST in a compression model of SCI with emphasis on sensory-motor outcomes alongside other complications, histopathological damage and also related signalling pathways.

AB  - Brachial amyotrophic diplegia (BAD) is defined the isolated upper limb weakness attributed to neurogenic atrophy, sparing lower extremity, respiratory and bulbar muscles. Although such phenotypes may be seen in number of conditions, previous reports pointed out that the label of BAD should refer to any patient with slowly and nonprogressive neurogenic atrophy of upper limbs remaining stable at least 18 months after initial presentation 50 year old man with unremarkable past history noticed after minor cervical spine trauma progressive weakness and wasting of left shoulder and arm which was followed within few months by gradual involvement of contralateral in relatively symmetric pattern. There were no symptoms in lower limbs, neck, bulbar muscles nor sphincter disturbances. On examination, patient exhibited a peculiar posture of both hands hanging loosely at his sides. There were fasciculations and atrophy of upper limb muscles. Reflexes could not be elicited in upper extremities but they were normal in the lower. Cranial nerves and sensory examination were unremarkable. Routine blood tests and search for GM1 antibodies were negative, whereas CK was found mildly elevated ( 361?mU/ml). Test for HIV-1 was positive with RNA level of 144.920 copies/ml and CD4 count 403/mm3. Electrophysiology showed in both sides low amplitude of compound muscle action potentials, mildly reduced velocity without evidence of conduction block or of temporal dispersion. Sensory conduction study was normal. On EMG, there was loss of motor units, acute and chronic neurogenic changes. Cervical MRI was normal. Patient neurological disability did not show progression. The case reported exhibits the following notable aspects: clinical and electrophysiological abnormalities fully restricted to upper limbs, lack of significant demyelinating features as well as of GM1 antibodies, absence of clinical signs related to immunosuppression due to HIV-1 infection.

AB  - Summary The peritoneum covers all walls of the abdominal cavity and all viscera within the abdominal cavity. Peritonitis, or inflammation of the peritoneum, may be classified as primary or secondary, localized or generalized, and aseptic or septic. Secondary generalized septic (bacterial) peritonitis is the most common form of peritonitis in small animals. Abdominal radiography and ultrasonography are useful diagnostic tools in cases of suspected peritonitis. Dogs and cats with septic peritonitis present with historical and physical examination findings similar to patients with acute abdominal disease of other causes. Many of the same challenges in the care of patients with septic peritonitis occur preoperatively and postoperatively, including hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, and altered coagulation. Surgery should be performed as soon as adequate efforts have been made to stabilize the patient's cardiovascular status and fluid balance. Principles of surgical therapy for septic peritonitis include source control, peritoneal lavage, and peritoneal drainage.

AB  - This study describes the origin and early development of a distinct organ of clonal regeneration in Ginkgo biloba, the basal chichi. These aggregates of suppressed shoot buds originate from superficial meristems located in the cotyledonary axils of all Ginkgo seedlings as part of their normal ontogeny. Within 6 wk of germination these buds become embedded in the cortex of the stem, and their subsequent growth and development occurs below the surface of the bark. When stimulated by some traumatic event that damages the seedling axis, one of these embedded cotyledonary buds usually grows down from the trunk to form a woody, rhizomelike basal chichi which, under appropriate conditions, is capable of generating both aerial shoots and adventitious roots. Vegetative regeneration by means of basal chichi has not only contributed to the long-term persistence of G. biloba in the forests of China, but may also have played a role in the remarkable survival of the genus since the Cretaceous.

AB  - Abstract A 25-year-old Thai housewife had a history of tuberculosis of the lymph nodes for six years that had been successfully treated with a course of anti-TB drugs. She developed several red, circumscribed, infiltrative plaques composed of umbilicated papules and pustules on her face and upper part of the body with cervical lymphadenopathy six months later. A pus smear from the lesion grew acid fast bacilli (AFB). Histopathological examination showed a mixed cell granuloma suggestive of infection. A T cell study showed a low CD4 count, and multi skin tests indicated cutaneous anergy. Culture from a biopsy specimen taken from the skin lesion grew M.chelonae; the cultures from blood, urine, and bone marrow. The lesions were not responsive to an anti TB drug given for 2 months based upon the results of the AFB positive pus smear before the culture and sensitivity reports were obtained. Since then the patient was treated with antibiotics according to the results of the sensitivity tests. A combination of amikacin and clarithromycin was started and hyperthermic therapy was later added with a partial response. Based upon the sensitivity test, kanamycin was introduced but had to be stopped because of ototoxicity. Sparfloxacin was used with an effective result but was discontinued for economic reasons. Finally, clarithromycin in combination with clofazimine and cryotherapy were given for a year before the lesions healed completely. It took a three years duration for the total course of treatment for this patient. She is still in remission after two years of follow-up period. This extensive cutaneous M.chelonae infection needed a prolonged combination of antibiotics with the addition of cryotherapy for the non-responsive lesions.

AB  - Objective To develop questions for an owner-completed outcome assessment instrument for dogs with orthopedic disease. Study Design Focus groups, key-informant interviews, surveys. Sample Population Owners of dogs with osteoarthritis (OA). Methods Audio recorded focus groups were transcribed. Descriptive statistics around discussed topics were calculated. A list of frequently discussed behaviors underwent discrimination and frequency endorsement analysis and was circulated for refinement among veterinarians experienced in treating dogs with orthopedic disease. The final list of behaviors was transformed into a series of questions and organized as the preliminary instrument for testing in further studies. Results Owners (n?=?27) participated in 4 focus groups. Based on the frequency of comments generated during focus groups and key-informant interviews, 30 behaviors were further screened by discrimination analysis and endorsement frequency in an additional cohort of 60 owners. No behaviors were classified as ?good? for discriminating between front and hind limb disease so a single, non-limb-specific instrument was developed. Four behaviors had an endorsement frequency ≤33% and were not considered further for inclusion in the preliminary instrument. Twenty-one questions associated with the remaining behaviors were used to create the preliminary Canine Orthopedic Index (COI) for psychometric testing in further studies. Conclusions A 21-question owner-completed COI was successfully developed in preparation for psychometric testing studies.

AB  - Objective? To compare biomechanical properties of 3 new generation polyethylene sutures (FiberTape [FT], FiberWire [FW], and OrthoFiber [OF]) with nylon leader line (NL) for use during extraarticular fixation of cranial cruciate deficient stifles. Study Design? In vitro biomechanical testing of suture loops under monotonic tensile and cyclical loading until failure. Sample Population? Constructs of FT, FW, OF, and NL. Methods? Twenty loops of each of 12 combinations of fixation and suture had monotonic tensile and cyclical loading. Two knotting techniques (square knot [SQ], slip knot [SL]) and a crimp clamp (CR) system were evaluated. Elongation, stiffness, and strength of constructs was tested. The main effects of group, loop material, and their interaction were evaluated. Results? Knotted FT, FW, and OF had less elongation than knotted NL under monotonic tensile and cyclical loading. Under monotonic tensile loading, knotted FT and OF were stiffer than knotted NL. CR FT, CR FW, and CR OF were stiffer than CR NL and CR FT, CR FW, and CR OF were stiffer than knotted FT, FW, and OF. FW and OF knotted loops were weaker than knotted NL. CR FT was stronger than CR NL. CR FT and CR OF were weaker than knotted FT and OF. Conclusions? Polyethylene sutures are stronger, stiffer and elongate less than nylon leader. Crimping suture alters the biomechanical properties of the loop. Clinical Relevance? FW, FT, and OF may perform better in reconstructive procedures, where increased strength and stiffness are considered to be beneficial.

AB  - Executive summary Background? This systematic review updates a previous review published in 2001. Cleansing is a vital component of wound management; however; little attention has been give to the solutions and techniques used for cleansing purposes. The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of different solutions, pressures and techniques used for wound cleansing to prevent infection and promote wound healing. Search strategy? Randomised and clinical controlled trials were identified using the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Additional searches of other databases and hand searches of journals and bibliographies was undertaken to identify further trials. Selection criteria? All randomised and clinical controlled trials involving adults and/or children whose wounds were cleaned with commercial cleansers, normal saline, water, chlorhexidine, hydrogen peroxide or povidone-iodine were eligible for inclusion. Studies that utilised solutions for preoperative skin cleansing, compared solutions for burns or dental procedures, and those that compared dressings for patients with ulcers were excluded from this review. Outcomes included rate of healing, incidence of infections or levels of bacterial count. Selection of potential articles, assessment of methodological quality and data abstraction was conducted independently by two reviewers. Trials with similar patients, comparisons, and outcomes were pooled. The data were analysed using Cochrane Review Manager 4.2. Where pooling was inappropriate, trials are discussed in a narrative review. Results? Fourteen randomised controlled trials were included that compared various solutions for wound cleansing. The evidence indicates that there is no difference in the infection and healing rates in acute and chronic wounds cleansed with either tap water or normal saline. An irrigation pressure of 13?psi is effective for cleansing wounds and reducing infection without causing tissue trauma. There were no studies comparing common techniques for wound cleansing such as swabbing or scrubbing. Showering postoperative wounds did not demonstrate any difference in infection rates; however, it increased the morale of the patient. Whirlpool therapy was effective in reducing inflammation and pain in surgical wounds. Conclusions? These conclusions are based on the best available clinical evidence. However, there is an urgent need to support these findings with rigorous research as some of the conclusions are based on single studies with limited sample sizes. Solutions for wound cleansing: ? The evidence supports the use of potable tap water for cleansing lacerations in both adults and children and postoperative wounds in adults only. ? Potable tap water as well as boiled and cooled water is also an effective wound cleansing solution. This finding, however, is based on a trial that had a small sample size. ? The evidence to support the use of potable tap water is limited (only one? study with low power); therefore, further studies are required to confirm that assumption. ? Povidone-iodine is an effective cleansing solution for contaminated wounds. Pressure for wound cleansing: ? A pressure of 13?psi is effective in reducing infection and inflammation in both adults and children with lacerations and traumatic wounds. Techniques for wound cleansing: ? Evidence to support or refute swabbing and scrubbing to cleanse wounds is lacking. ? The review demonstrated no evidence of a difference in the wound infection and healing rates between wounds that were showered and those that were not. ? The evidence for showering ulcers and other chronic wounds is lacking; therefore, this technique of wound cleansing should be undertaken with caution. ? Whirlpool therapy is effective to reduce pain and inflammation in surgical wounds and improve the healing rate in pressure ulcers. ? The evidence to support the use of Sitz bath for patients following episiotomy is limited.

AB  - Objective? To evaluate the accuracy of linear measurements obtained from computer tomography (CT) images of staged radio-ulnar incongruence in a canine cadaver forelimb model. Study Design? CT evaluation of induced progressive radio-ulnar incongruence in canine cadaveric forelimbs. Sample Population? Eight cadaveric canine left forelimbs. Procedure? A type 2 external skeletal fixator (ESF) with linear motors was attached to the radius in 8 cadaveric left canine forelimbs. Contiguous incremental and helical CT images of the proximal radio-ulnar articulation were acquired in the transverse, sagittal and dorsal planes. The radius was shortened by 1, 2, and 4?mm increments and scanning protocols were repeated at each increment. Digital caliper and CT image analysis measured the progressive change in distance between 2 marking spheres and the epiphyseal bone surfaces of the radio-ulnar articulation. Statistical analysis of measurements from incremental and helical CT acquisitions, and direct and reformatted images were compared with inter-sphere distance using Pearson product moment correlation coefficients. Results? The reformatted incremental acquisition series at the mid-coronoid in the oblique plane had the highest correlation coefficient (r-value) at 0.908. The mid-coronoid in the dorsal plane had the second highest r-value (0.856). The coronoid incisure in the sagittal plane had an r-value of 0.826. The reformatted incremental acquisition series at the coronoid incisure in the oblique plane had the lowest r-value, 0.592. Conclusion? Measurement of radioulnar incongruence may be best performed using reformatted incremental acquisition CT in the mid-coronoid region in an oblique plane. Clinical Relevance? Use of the technique reported in this study may enable determination of the association, if any, between radioulnar incongruence and developmental diseases of the canine elbow.
