AB  - Aim? Review of four failures of refrigeration facilities in Victorian institutional blood banks reported to ARCBS in the first 4?months of 2004. These incidents at both public and private institutions, in metropolitan and regional settings, resulted in loss of 148 units of red cells, 7 vials of RhD Ig and 2 bottles of Albumex. Incidents were investigated and root causes identified by initial phone interview and visits to blood bank storage facilities. Result? Case 1: Temperature fell below 0?°C at remote site, alarm was activated at monitoring centre (main lab) but without response. Case 2: Power failure resulted in rise in temperature. Alarm did not activate until power was restored. Alarms were set outside required storage temperatures. Case 3: Circuit failure resulted in loss of power. Alarm was activated, but then switched off and no further action taken. Case 4: Compressor failure resulted in alarm activation. Alarm and monitoring devices were deactivated while repairs carried out. Product was not moved to other storage facilities. These cases all highlight the importance of procedures, training, equipment and maintenance. Conclusion? Losses of precious blood components and products through refrigeration failures are preventable. Vital improvements should include commissioning refrigeration equipment that meets AS 3864, protocol development and staff training in use of procedures to be followed when out of temperature events occur, and performance of regular preventative maintenance, calibration and testing of storage and monitoring equipment. ARCBS can work with institutional blood banks to improve storage and management of blood.

AB  - Objectives? To characterize equine bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) growth characteristics and frequency as well as their adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential. Study Design? In vitro experimental study. Animals? Foals (n=3, age range, 17?51 days) and young horses (n=5, age range, 9 months to 5 years). Methods? Equine MSCs were harvested and isolated from sternal BM aspirates and grown up to passage 10 to determine cell-doubling (CD) characteristics. Limit dilution assays were performed on primary and passaged MSCs to determine the frequency of colony-forming units with a fibroblastic phenotype (CFU-F), and the frequency of MSC differentiation into adipocytes (CFU-Ad) and osteoblasts (CFU-Ob). Results? Initial MSC isolates had a lag phase with a significantly longer CD time (DT=4.9±1.6 days) compared with the average DT (1.4±0.22 days) of subsequent MSC passages. Approximately 1 in 4224±3265 of the total nucleated BM cells displayed fibroblast colony-forming activity. Primary MSCs differentiated in response to adipogenic and osteogenic inductive conditions and maintained their differentiation potential during subsequent passages. Conclusions? The frequency, in vitro growth rate, and adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential of foals and young adult horses are similar to those documented for BM MSCs of other mammalian species. Clinical Relevance? The results have direct relevance to the use of BM as a potential source of adult stem cells for tissue engineering applications in equine veterinary medicine.

AB  - Abstract One of the stumbling blocks in the formation of a thermoresponsive cell-hydrogel hybrid (TCH) is the efficient incorporation of cells in thermoresponsive hydrogels (TH) using traditional top-down (i.e., cells penetrate in the pre-set gels from top surface) approach. This approach is slow and tedious because the hydrogel needs to soak in the cells culture for a long time to allow cells to penetrate from the gel surface in to the bulk of the gel. In addition, cell incorporation into TH is difficult because elevated dissolution temperatures of gelators are detrimental to cell viability, whereas the highly viscous gel state that formed at ambient temperatures retards the penetration of cells. We propose a bottom-up approach (i.e., cells mixed prior to gel setting) using a novel two-step protocol. The first step is the rapid cooling of the agarose solution from its dissolution temperature (98°C) to 37°C and equilibrating for 3?4 min. The second step is the mixing of fibroblasts with the agarose solution and natural cooling to the room temperature to form the TCH. With this novel protocol, 90% of fibroblasts are found to be trapped in the cell-gel hybrid.

AB  - Abstract Objective To assess whether the initiation of vasopressor infusions via peripheral venous catheters (PVC) compared to central venous catheters (CVC) in ED patients with early septic shock was associated with differences in processes of care and outcomes. Methods We conducted a post-hoc analysis of the ARISE trial. We compared participants who had a vasopressor infusion first commenced via a PVC versus a CVC. The primary outcome was 90 day mortality. Results We studied 937 participants. Of these, 389 (42%) had early vasopressor infusion commenced via a PVC and 548 (58%) via a CVC. Trial participants who received a vasopressor infusion via a PVC were more severely ill, with higher median (interquartile range [IQR]) Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores (17 [13?23] versus 16 [12?21], P = 0.003), and higher median (IQR) lactate (mmol/L) (3.6 [1.9?5.8] versus 2.5 [1.5?4.5], P?<?0.001). After adjusting for baseline covariates, the estimated odds ratio for mortality for PVC-treated patients was 1.26 (95% confidence interval 0.95?1.67, P = 0.11). Trial participants who had vasopressors commenced via PVC had a shorter median (IQR) time to commencement of antimicrobials (55 [32?96] versus 71.5 [39?119] min, P?<?0.001) and a shorter median (IQR) time to commencement of vasopressors (2.4 [1.3?3.9] versus 4.9 [3.5?6.6] h, P?<?0.001). Conclusion The practice of commencing a vasopressor infusion via a PVC was common in the ARISE trial and more frequent in trial participants with higher severity of illness. Commencement of a vasopressor infusion via a PVC was associated with some improvements in processes of care and, after adjustment, was not associated with an increased risk of death.

AB  - Objectives To examine the clinical signs, laboratory findings, possible predisposing factors, antimicrobial sensitivity and outcomes of dogs and cats diagnosed with urinary tract infection caused by Corynebacterium urealyticum. Materials and Methods Retrospective, observational study of dogs and cats that were diagnosed with urinary tract infection caused by C. urealyticum. Results This report concerns a total of 11 dogs and 10 cats. All cats had a history of urethral catheterisation, and six cats had undergone urological surgery before diagnosis of this specific infection. Dogs had history of neurogenic urinary incontinence (n=5), urethral catheterisation (n=4), urological surgery (n=4), lower urinary tract disease (n=2) or prostatic disease (n=1). In seven animals, previous urine culture was negative. Median urine pH was 8.6 (interquartile range 7.5 to 9), and 19 animals had pyuria and struvite crystalluria. Encrusted cystitis was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound in nine animals. All but one isolate were resistant to at least three antimicrobial classes. Thirteen isolates were sensitive to tetracyclines. There was bacterial and clinical resolution of the infection in nine dogs and seven cats. Two animals died from sepsis and two cats were euthanased because of clinical deterioration. Clinical Significance Urinary tract infection caused by C. urealyticum should be suspected in animals with pre-existing urinary disorders, especially if urine is alkaline and there is struvite crystalluria, negative routine urine culture and encrusted cystitis.

AB  - This study was performed to determine the cardiovascular responses to isoflurane in euthyroid and hypothyroid dogs. Four healthy mixed-breed dogs were studied prior to thyroidectomy (PRE), 6 months after thyroidectomy (HYP), and after 2 months of oral supplementation with 1-thyroxine (SUP). Heart rate (HR), cardiac output (Q?), stroke volume (SV), systolic, diastolic, mean arterial blood pressure (SAP, DAP, MAP), and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were determined in awake dogs and in the same dogs when end-tidal isoflurane concentrations were 1.28%, 1.92%, and 2.56%. Ventilation was controlled in anesthetized dogs and Paco2 maintained between 38 to 42 mm Hg. Isoflurane caused significant (P <.05) dose-dependent reduction in Q?, SV, SAP, DAP, and MAP in the PRE, HYP, and SUP dogs. Cardiac output was lower in the HYP dogs than in the PRE or SUP dogs during awake measurement. TPR was increased in the awake HYP dogs compared with the PRE or SUP dogs. During anesthesia, HYP dogs tended to have lower Q?, SV, SAP, and MAP than the PRE or SUP groups, but the only significant reduction was SAP during 1.5 MAC. The cardiovascular responses to isoflurane in hypothyroid dogs are similar to euthyroid animals with a dose-dependent depression in Q?, SV, and arterial pressure.

They are found in up to 80% of patients with epilepsy but are only weakly related to seizure frequency or seizure severity. Indeed their clinical relevance in highly controversial and a principle of treatment is to avoid over-interpretation of epileptiform activity. Experimental data shows that interictal spikes and ictal discharges are generated by different populations of neuron through different cellular and network mechanisms and may represent a condition that delays or prevents seizure onset. However, in the immature brain seizure discharges may cause neuronal cell loss. In older children and adults interictal discharges can be accompanied by brief interruption of cognitive function even in the absence of overt seizures (transitory cognitive impairment). In children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome and CSWS (continuous spike-waves during slow sleep) prolonged nocturnal discharges can have devastating effects on language and / or behavior. This multi-disciplinary workshop will discuss the pathophysiology of interictal discharges and the significance of epileptiform activity in neonates and in older children.

AB  - Summary This chapter summarizes assessment and management of the patient with sepsis. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory, cellular and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than sepsis alone. Management of sepsis requires invasive monitoring and critical care expertise. Arterial and central venous monitoring will be required if the patient is in septic shock or once in the ICU but placement should not delay initial priorities. The first priority is adequate fluid resuscitation, using a balanced crystalloid. This should be guided by a clinical assessment of the circulation and tissue perfusion. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in sepsis and is associated with a worse outcome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a complication of sepsis. This should be suspected in patients with sepsis and also in patients with septic shock who develop purpura, prolonged oozing from puncture sites or bleeding from the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts.

AB  - Abstract Background Recent studies provide evidence for significant and previously underestimated barrier damaging effects of repeated exposure to 60% n-propanol in healthy skin in vivo. Objectives To investigate further the cumulative effects of a range of n-propanol concentrations relevant at the workplace in healthy and atopic dermatitis (AD) individuals, and study the modulation of the outcomes by co-exposure and host-related factors. Methods Healthy adult and AD volunteers were exposed to n-propanol concentrations from 30% to 75% in occlusion-modified tandem repeated irritation test with measurements of erythema, transepidermal water loss, capacitance, and the natural moisturizing factor (NMF) levels at baseline and after 96?hours. Results n-Propanol exerted significant barrier damaging effects even at the lowest concentration in both groups. Exposure to all n-propanol concentrations significantly reduced the NMF levels. Preceding low-grade trauma by occlusion/water exposure reduced the skin irritation threshold in both groups. The differences in the severity of the barrier function impairment after exposure to the same concentrations under the same conditions between the AD and control groups were significant. Conclusions The negative effects of cumulative exposure to n-propanol in healthy and atopic skin shown in the study suggest the need for critical re-evaluation of its irritant properties in vivo.

AB  - Objective To compare pelvic limb joint kinematics and temporal gait characteristics during land-based and aquatic-based treadmill walking in dogs that have undergone surgical stabilisation for cranial cruciate ligament deficiency. Materials and Methods Client-owned dogs with surgically stabilised stifles following cranial cruciate ligament deficiency performed three walking trials consisting of three consecutive gait cycles on an aquatic treadmill under four water levels. Hip, stifle and hock range of motion; peak extension; and peak flexion were assessed for the affected limb at each water level. Gait cycle time and stance phase percentage were also determined. Results Ten client-owned dogs of varying breeds were evaluated at a mean of 55·2?days postoperatively. Aquatic treadmill water level influenced pelvic limb kinematics and temporal gait outcomes. Increased stifle joint flexion was observed as treadmill water level increased, peaking when the water level was at the hip. Similarly, hip flexion increased at the hip water level. Stifle range of motion was greatest at stifle and hip water levels. Stance phase percentage was significantly decreased when water level was at the hip. Clinical Significance Aquatic treadmill walking has become a common rehabilitation modality following surgical stabilisation of cranial cruciate ligament deficiency. However, evidence-based best practice guidelines to enhance stifle kinematics do not exist. Our findings suggest that rehabilitation utilising a water level at or above the stifle will achieve the best stifle kinematics following surgical stifle stabilisation.

AB  - 19F MRI and optical imaging are two powerful noninvasive molecular imaging modalities in biomedical applications. 19F MRI has great potential for high resolution in vivo imaging, while fluorescent probes enable ultracontrast cellular/tissue imaging with high accuracy and sensitivity. A bimodal nanoprobe is developed, integrating the merits of 19F MRI and fluorescence imaging into a single synthetic molecule, which is further engineered into nanoprobe, by addressing shortcomings of conventional contrast agents to explore the quantitative 19F MRI and fluorescence imaging and cell tracking. Results show that this bimodal imaging nanoprobe presents high correlation of 19F MR signal and NIR fluorescence intensity in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, this nanoprobe enables quantitative 19F MR analysis, confirmed by a complementary fluorescence analysis. This unique feature can hardly be obtained by traditional 19F MRI contrast agents. It is envisioned that this nanoprobe can hold great potential for quantitative and sensitive multi-modal molecular imaging.

AB  - Summary Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory response to pancreatic injury., The response can be mild and local, or extend to peripancreatic and systemic inflammation. The systemic inflammatory response can also lead to vascular leak, pulmonary edema, hypovolemia hypotension and shock, and ischemic injury to the pancreas, kidney and intestines. The most common etiologies of acute pancreatitis are gallstones, alcoholism, and idiopathic. Treatment is initially aimed at fluid resuscitation, support of organ dysfunction, and in severe cases enteral feeding. Therapeutic endoscopy may be needed to dislodge an impacted gallstone to treat bacterial cholangitis. Treatment is supportive, and a plan to prevent recurrence should be implemented before discharge.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? To determine the institution's current non-therapeutic (negative) appendicectomy rate; the frequency of clinical predictors for appendicitis in patients who underwent appendicectomy; and the utilization and accuracy of ultrasound scans (USS) and computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of appendicitis. Methods:? A retrospective chart review was conducted in an adult, metropolitan teaching hospital. Patients who presented to the ED and underwent an appendicectomy over a 12-month period were analysed. Symptoms and signs predictive of appendicitis, results of USS and CT scans if performed, and histopathology findings were abstracted from patient records. Results:? Two hundred and forty patients had appendicectomies, 147 (61%) were male and the median age was 25 years (range 14?78 years). The negative appendicectomy rate was 14.3% (95% CI 9.1?21.0%) and 18.3% (95% CI 11.0?26.7%) in males and females, respectively. Abdominal pain shifting to the right iliac fossa (RIF), anorexia and RIF rebound tenderness were found more frequently in patients with positive than negative appendicectomies (P < 0.05). USS and CT scans were performed in 68 (28%) and 15 (9.5%) patients, respectively. The likelihood ratio for appendicitis in patients with a normal USS or a normal CT scan was 0.83 (95% CI 0.56?1.24) and 0.08 (95% CI 0.01?0.60), respectively. There were no false positive CT scan results. Conclusion:? Computed tomoraphy scanning should play an increasing role in the ED management of suspected appendicitis. Our negative appendicectomy rate could potentially be halved by the introduction of CT scans in the diagnostic work up of these patients.

AB  - Summary Hypothalamic obesity is an intractable form of obesity syndrome that was initially described in patients with hypothalamic tumours and surgical damage. However, this definition is now expanded to include obesity developing after a variety of insults, including intracranial infections, infiltrations, trauma, vascular problems and hydrocephalus, in addition to acquired or congenital functional defects in central energy homeostasis in children with the so-called common obesity. The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying hypothalamic obesity are complex and multifactorial. Weight gain results from damage to the ventromedial hypothalamus, which leads, variously, to hyperphagia, a low-resting metabolic rate; autonomic imbalance; growth hormone-, gonadotropins and thyroid-stimulating hormone deficiency; hypomobility; and insomnia. Hypothalamic obesity did not receive enough attention, as evidenced by rarity of studies in this group of patients. A satellite symposium was held during the European Congress of Obesity in May 2011, in Istanbul, Turkey, to discuss recent developments and concepts regarding pathophysiology and management of hypothalamic obesity in children. An international group of leading researchers presented certain aspects of the problem. This paper summarizes the highlights of this symposium. Understanding the central role of the hypothalamus in the regulation of feeding and energy metabolism will help us gain insights into the pathogenesis and management of common obesity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To report the clinical presentation, surgical treatment and outcomes of dogs with retrobulbar abscesses refractory to intra-oral lancing and antibiotics. METHODS Medical records from January 2006 through September 2014 were reviewed and dogs with retrobulbar abscesses failing treatment with antibiotics and intra-oral lancing were included. Clinicopathologic, imaging and surgical details were extracted from the medical records. Referring veterinarians and owners were interviewed via telephone for follow-up data. RESULTS A total of six dogs were included in the study. The most common clinical signs were pain upon opening of the mouth, exophthalmos and prolapsed nictitans. Computed tomography was performed in five dogs, ultrasound in four and magnetic resonance imaging in one. Imaging identified an abscess in all dogs, with a suspected foreign body in four dogs. Surgical approach was a modified lateral orbitotomy in five dogs. No foreign body was identified during surgery in all dog. All dogs surviving to discharge did not have recurrence of clinical signs (follow-up time range: 27 to 95 months). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Dogs with retrobulbar abscesses refractory to standard therapy can experience long-term resolution of clinical signs with surgical treatment, most commonly via a modified lateral orbitotomy.

AB  - Groups of 48 Wistar rats were subjected to thrice-weekly palatal application of the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) in propylene glycol 18, 12, 6 or 2 times, each 255 nmol 4NQO, in order to examine the relationship between the dose of the carcinogen and the tumour response. Other groups were treated with solvent alone or were left untreated. When the carcinogen was applied 18 or 12 times, squamous cell or verrucous carcinomas developed in 50% of the rats in 11 and 12 months, respectively, whereas rats subjected to the carcinogen 6 times demonstrated a 50% cancer rate in 23 months. Rats twice exposed to the carcinogen demonstrated a tumour rate of 25% in 30 months. Decreasing doses of 4NQO thus prolonged the latency period and decreased the tumour rate. The tumour development in the animals subjected to two carcinogen applications was significantly different from the tumour development among the solvent-treated animals, indicating that application of 255 nmol may approximate the initiating dose of 4NQO to be used in a two- or multi-stage carcinogenesis protocol. Most of the carcinomas, either squamous cell or verrucous, were located to the hard palate and to the gingival region of the upper jaw. Impaction of hair, bedding material and food was thought to promote the carcinogenic process.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate whether cerclage wire or a lateral plate increases the peak-torque load to failure, compared to femora without adjunctive fixation, in femora implanted with Zurich Cementless stems. Study Design In vitro biomechanical study. Sample Population Paired femora from adult dogs (n?=?24) weighing 28?35?kg. Methods Pairs of femora were implanted with a stem and randomly assigned to 2 treatment groups: cerclage or plate. Within each pair, either 3 loop cerclage wires or a laterally applied 12-hole Advanced Locking Plate System 10-mm plate (ALPS 10) were implanted in a femur, whereas the contralateral femur acted as control with no adjunctive fixation. After application of a static axial load each specimen was loaded to failure in torsion. Peak torque load at failure was compared between femora with each adjunctive fixation and the control using a paired t-test; P?<?.05 was considered significant. Results In both treatment groups, femora with adjunctive fixation failed at higher loads compared to the femora without fixation; however, significant difference in peak torque at failure between treated femora and control was found only in the plated group (P?<?.05). Femora implanted with plates and with cerclage were 13.9% and 7.2% stronger in torsion than the femora without fixation, respectively. Conclusions Adjunctive fixation with a laterally applied ALPS 10 may aid in the prevention of peri-prosthetic fractures associated with Zurich Cementless medium stems.
