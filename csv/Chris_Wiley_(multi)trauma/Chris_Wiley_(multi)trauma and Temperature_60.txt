AB  - Abstract Background Parent education and training programmes can improve maternal psychosocial health, child behavioural problems and parenting practices. This review assesses the effects of parenting interventions for reducing child injury. Objectives To assess the effects of parenting interventions for preventing unintentional injury as well as increasing possession and use of safety equipment and parental safety practices. Search strategy We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological Abstracts, Psych INFO, Sociofile, Social Science Citation Index, CINAHL, Dissertation Abstracts, ERIC, DARE, ASSIA, Web of Science, SIGLE and ZETOC. We also handsearched abstracts from the World Conferences on Injury Prevention  11 of which were home visiting programmes and two of which were paediatric practice-based interventions. Thirteen studies recruited families at risk of adverse child health outcomes. Nine RCTs were included in the primary meta-analysis, which indicated that intervention families had a significantly lower risk of injury (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.95). Several studies found fewer home hazards, a home environment more conducive to child safety, or a greater number of safety practices in intervention families. Authors' conclusions Parenting interventions, most commonly provided within the home using multi-faceted interventions may be effective in reducing child injury. The evidence relates mainly to interventions provided to families at risk of adverse child health outcomes. Further research is required to explore mechanisms by which these interventions reduce injury, the features of parenting interventions that are necessary or sufficient to reduce injury and the generalisability to different population groups. Plain Language Summary Parenting interventions for the prevention of unintentional injuries in childhood Parent education and training programmes can improve parenting, mothers' mental health and behaviour problems in children. This review looked at whether such programmes also help parents provide a safer home environment and reduce injuries in children. The reviewers found 15 parent education and training programmes that had been studied which measured home safety or childhood injuries. Eleven of these were home visiting programmes which provided a range of support services as well as parent education or training. These were usually provided to families whose children were considered to be at risk of poor health. The results showed that children from families who had received the education and training programmes had fewer injuries than those from families who had not had the programmes. The results for home safety were more varied, but some studies found a positive effect on home safety. It is not clear exactly how these programmes reduce injuries or whether they would work as well in less disadvantaged groups or in different settings.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To systematically review published studies evaluating pain associated with onychectomy in cats, and to assess the efficacy of the analgesic therapies applied. Databases used Four sources were used to identify manuscripts for review. Databases searched were those of the National Library of Medicine, EMBASE and CAB International. In addition, pertinent references in the bibliographies of included articles were retrieved. Results Twenty manuscripts published in refereed journals were reviewed. These included papers reporting 18 clinical trials and two studies conducted in conditioned research cats. Twelve analgesics were evaluated, including seven opioids, four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and one local anesthetic. Nine studies involved a direct comparison of analgesic agents. Limb use was abnormal when measured at 2 and 12 days following onychectomy, and neither fentanyl patch nor butorphanol administration resulted in normal use of the surgical limb. In another study, cats evaluated at 6 months after this surgery were not lame. Differing surgical techniques were compared in six studies; the results indicated that pain scores were lower after laser surgery than after scalpel surgery. The difficulties associated with assessing pain in cats and the lack of sensitivity of the evaluation systems utilized were highlighted in many of the studies. Huge variations in dose and dosing strategies had significant impacts on drug efficacy. Statistically significant differences among treatments were found in most studies; however, no clearly superior analgesic treatment was identified. A combination of meloxicam or robenacoxib with an opioid may provide more effective analgesia and should be evaluated.

AB  - Objective To determine the in vitro effects of differing growth factor treatments on the fibrochondrogenic potential of fibroblast-like synoviocytes from cruciate ligament deficient femorotibial joints of dogs. Study Design In vitro study. Sample Population Synoviocytes from dogs (n?=?8) with naturally occurring cruciate ligament insufficiency. Methods Synoviocytes were cultured in monolayer and synthesized into tensioned synoviocyte bioscaffolds (TSB) suspended in media containing TGF-?3, or FGF-2, TGF-?1, and IGF-I. The 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay and toluidine blue stain assessed glycosaminoglycan content; hydroxyproline assay, and collagen I and II immunohistochemistry assessed collagen content. Biomechanical properties were determined by materials testing/force?deformation curves. Results All tissue cultures formed tensioned fibrous tissue-like constructs. Mean tissue cellularity and cellular viability was significantly greater in the triple growth factor-treated TSB by 0.09% and 44%, respectively. Percentage collagen content, and relative gene expression for collagen I, II, and aggrecan was not significantly different between groups. Median percentage of GAG content was significantly greater in triple growth factor-treated TSB by 1.6%. Biomechanical properties were not different in compression. Triple growth factor-treated TSB were significantly stronger in toughness, peak load to failure, and stiffness in tension. Conclusions TGF-?3 cultured bioscaffolds failed to outperform triple growth factor-treated TSB. Architectural extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and cellularity likely explained the differences between groups. TGF-?3 alone cannot be recommended at this time for in vitro formation of autologous fibrocartilage bioscaffolds for meniscal deficiency.

(TF) to the 3-loop pulley (3LP) for repair of equine tendon lacerations. The use of 4TF devices versus 5TF devices on load to ultimate failure and load to a 2?mm gap was also compared. Study Design Ex vivo biomechanical study; unbalanced incomplete block (horse) design. Samples Cadaveric equine forelimb superficial digital flexor tendon (n?=?20 paired tendons). Methods Ten tendon pairs were selected randomly and repaired with a 3LP and 4TF pattern, and 10 tendon pairs repaired with a 3LP and 5TF pattern. Load to ultimate failure, load to a 2?mm gap, mode of failure, and gap at failure were obtained using materials testing. Results The 3LP had a significantly greater ultimate load to failure (P?<?.001, respectively) and a significantly higher load to a 2?mm gap than both TF repairs (P?<?.001, respectively). The most frequent mode of failure was suture pull-out for the 3LP and anchor pull-out for the TF. Gap at failure was significantly larger in the 3LP than both TF repairs (P?<?.001). The ultimate load to failure was significantly higher for the 5TF than the 4TF (P?=?.004) but there was no significant difference in load to a 2?mm gap, or gap at failure between both TF repairs (P?=?.11, P?=?.15, respectively). Conclusions Neither TF repair was stronger than the 3LP in load to ultimate failure and load to a 2?mm gap. Addition of a fifth TF device significantly increased the load to ultimate failure but did effect the load to a 2?mm gap over the 4TF.

KW  - alcohol withdrawal scale sedation compliance
PY  - 2006
AB  - Abstract Background: Multi-item scales for monitoring alcohol withdrawal reactions have been used since the 1970s, and since 1985 we have used a modified version of the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) in our general hospitals. This study was conducted to determine whether a shorter version of the scale would prove easier to use without loss of accuracy. Methods: A simultaneous ?crossover? clinical audit using two hospitals. The shortened scale was developed from the existing one, and had 10 items as opposed to the previous 18. The patients were followed throughout their course and the incidences of complication, the frequency of sedation, the delay in initiating monitoring and the ease of use were recorded. Results: There were 106 patients managed with the old scale and 96 with the new. The rate of complication was not different, being 16% in patients managed using the old scale and 14.5% using the new scale; the rates of sedation were 49 and 48%, respectively. Patients managed with the new scale had a shorter course with a median duration of 27.6?h compared with 40?h. The time from admission to first recording of a score was 5.4?h for the new scale and 4.8?h for the old, which is not a significant difference. Both scores were used according to instructions, but staff reported that the shortened scale was easier to use. Conclusions: We conclude that a shortened form of the CIWA alcohol withdrawal scale works as well as the original and is simple to use.

AB  - Objective? To estimate maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and time to maximum plasma (tmax) bupivacaine concentration after intra-articular administration of bupivacaine for single injection (SI) and injection followed by continuous infusion (CI) in normal dogs. Study Design? Cross-over design with a 2-week washout period. Animals? Healthy Coon Hound dogs (n=8). Methods? Using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, canine plasma bupivacaine concentration was measured before and after SI (1.5?mg/kg) and CI (1.5?mg/kg and 0.3?mg/kg/h). Software was used to establish plasma concentration?time curves and estimate Cmax, Tmax and other pharmacokinetic variables for comparison of SI and CI. Results? Bupivacaine plasma concentration after SI and CI best fit a 3 exponential model. For SI, mean maximum concentration (Cmax, 1.33±0.954??g/mL) occurred at 11.37±4.546 minutes. For CI, mean Cmax (1.13±0.509??g/mL) occurred at 10.37±4.109 minutes. The area under the concentration?time curve was smaller for SI (143.59±118.390??g/mL ? min) than for CI (626.502±423.653??g/mL ? min, P=.02) and half-life was shorter for SI (61.33±77.706 minutes) than for CI (245.363±104.415 minutes, P=.01). The highest plasma bupivacaine concentration for any dog was 3.2??g/mL for SI and 2.3??g/mL for CI. Conclusion? Intra-articular bupivacaine administration results in delayed absorption from the stifle into the systemic circulation with mean Cmax below that considered toxic and no systemic drug accumulation. Clinical Relevance? Intra-articular bupivacaine can be administered with small risk of reaching toxic plasma concentrations in dogs, though toxic concentrations may be approached. Caution should be exercised with multimodal bupivacaine administration because plasma drug concentration may rise higher than with single intra-articular injection.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the effects of antebrachial rotation at 3 elbow flexion angles on contact mechanics and 3-dimensional (3D) alignment of normal dog elbows. Study Design Ex vivo biomechanical study. Animals Unpaired thoracic limbs from 18 dogs (mean ± SD weight, 27 ± 4 kg). Methods With the limb under 200 N axial load, digital pressure sensors measured contact area (CA), mean contact pressure (MCP), peak contact pressure (PCP), and PCP location in the medial and lateral elbow compartments, and 3D static poses of the elbow were obtained. Each specimen was tested at 115°, 135°, and 155° elbow flexion, with the antebrachium in a neutral position, in 28° supination, and in 16° pronation. Repeated measure ANOVAs with post-hoc Bonferroni (P ≤ .0167) were performed. Results Both pronation and supination decreased CA by 16% and 8% and increased PCP by 5% and 10% in the medial and lateral compartments, respectively. PCP location moved 2.3 mm (1.8?3.2 mm) closer to the apex of the medial coronoid process in pronation and 2.0 mm (1.8?2.2 mm) farther away in supination. The radial head and medial coronoid process rotated 5.4° and 1.9° internally during pronation and 7.2° and 1.2° externally during supination. Conclusions Contact mechanics and 3D alignment of normal dog elbows varied significantly at different elbow poses.

AB  - This is the author's fourth revision of a geriatrics bibliography. Approximately one-third of the previous references have been replaced by more current or more detailed articles. Because the literature pertinent to geriatrics has continued to grow ever more rapidly, it has been necessary to omit many informative articles from the bibliography. Preference is given to recent publications; almost all of the references date from the past four years. Some articles were selected to highlight current controversies or changes in viewpoint. An occasional unrefereed article is cited to amplify geriatric aspects of common diseases. Most of the references deal specifically with an elderly patient population, though few use a multidisciplinary approach. Studies of the elderly are confounded by concomitants of aging frequent but not universal in our society: inactivity, obesity, malnutrition, and psychosocial trauma. The articles cited concern primarily medical ailments of the elderly but legal, ethical, and sociologic topics are also covered. The references are divided into categories. The first (I) set deals with some possible causes of aging, the second (II) with physiologic decline accompanying aging, the third (III) with the atypical and nonspecific characteristics of illness among geriatric patients, the fourth (IV) with the elderly and society, and the fifth (V) with care options. The remainder of the references are cited by pertinent medical specialty. Within each category, references are divided by disease process. Articles are further subgrouped by aspects of those diseases such as evaluation or therapy.

AB  - Abstract Laser-induced thermal effects in optically trapped microspheres and single cells are investigated by quantum dot luminescence thermometry. Thermal spectroscopy has revealed a non-localized temperature distribution around the trap that extends over tens of micrometers, in agreement with previous theoretical models besides identifying water absorption as the most important heating source. The experimental results of thermal loading at a variety of wavelengths reveal that an optimum trapping wavelength exists for biological applications close to 820 nm. This is corroborated by a simultaneous analysis of the spectral dependence of cellular heating and damage in human lymphocytes during optical trapping. This quantum dot luminescence thermometry demonstrates that optical trapping with 820 nm laser radiation produces minimum intracellular heating, well below the cytotoxic level (43 °C), thus, avoiding cell damage.

AB  - An eight-year-old bull mastiff dog underwent a craniotomy for surgical excision of an olfactory lobe meningioma. Rapidly progressive neurological deficits with cervical pain developed within the early postoperative period. Intraventricular and cervical subarachnoid space air accumulation (pneumorrhachis) was identified through magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. Repair of a dural defect using synthetic dura substitute resulted in gradual resolution of neurological signs attributable to the tension pneumocephalus and subarachnoid space pneumorrhachis. Regrowth of the meningioma was not observed. Postoperative intraventricular tension pneumocephalus and air accumulation within subarachnoid space are uncommon but life-threatening complications of intracranial surgery. Early diagnosis and treatment can result in a satisfactory outcome.

AB  - Objectives Defects in copper metabolism have been described in several dog breeds, and recently, it has been suggested that changes in other essential trace elements could be involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic disease. This study measured hepatic copper accumulation and its interactions with other essential trace and toxic metals in dogs diagnosed with chronic hepatitis. Methods Liver samples of 20 chronic hepatitis and 20 healthy dogs were collected. Samples were acid digested, and essential metals (cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molibdenum, selenium and zinc) and toxic metals (arsenic, cadmium, mercury and lead) were analysed by inductively?coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Results Copper concentrations were significantly higher in dogs affected by hepatic disease than in controls. Dogs having chronic hepatitis with liver copper concentration greater than 100 mg/kg wet weight showed statistically higher cobalt, manganese and zinc concentrations than dogs having chronic hepatitis with liver copper concentrations less than 100 mg/kg wet weight and controls. Toxic metal concentrations were low ? in all cases below the threshold associated with toxicity in dogs. Clinical Significance Dogs with chronic hepatitis not only have increased concentrations of copper in the liver but also increased concentrations of cobalt, manganese and zinc; measurement of these elements may perhaps aid in diagnosis of liver disease in dogs.

AB  - Background Needle-free, transcutaneous pneumatic injection systems can be used to deliver therapeutic solutions to targeted layers of skin in a minimally invasive manner. Methods To evaluate jet infiltration patterns and tissue reactions, 5% isotonic and 20% hypertonic glucose solutions were pneumatically injected into in vivo micropig skin. Gelatin TM phantom was additionally prepared to analyze penetration and dispersion patterns for different experimental settings. Results As immediate tissue reactions in the in vivo micropig skin, distinct pneumatic injection injury zones (PIIZs) in the dermis, extending from the papillary dermis deep into the dermo-subcutaneous junction, were generated with the 5% and 20% glucose solutions and with pneumatic pressures of 4.64 and 5.7 bars, respectively. PIIZs markedly decreased in appearance at 1 day after treatment, accompanied by inflammatory cell infiltration, and disappeared at 7 days post-treatment with increased collagen and elastin production. In TM phantom study, the PIIZs created by 20% glucose mainly comprised a single, homogenous, round to oval zone, whereas those created by 5% glucose were irregular and multi-lobular. Conclusion The present study suggests that transcutaneous pneumatic injection therapy may exert mechanical stimulatory effects, immediate tissue shrinkage via hypertonic solutions, and late tissue regeneration effects during wound healing.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) results in paraplegia or quadriplegia, and currently, therapeutic interventions for axonal regeneration after SCI are not clinically available. Animal studies have revealed that glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) plays multiple beneficial roles in neuroprotection, glial scarring remodeling, axon regeneration and remyelination in SCI. However, the poor physicochemical stability of GDNF, as well as its limited ability to cross the blood?spinal cord barrier, hampers the development of GDNF as an effective therapeutic intervention in clinical practice. In this study, a novel temperature-sensitive heparin?poloxamer (HP) hydrogel with high GDNF-binding affinity was developed. HP hydrogels showed a supporting scaffold for GDNF when it was injected into the lesion epicenter after SCI. GDNF-HP by orthotopic injection on lesioned spinal cord promoted the beneficial effects of GDNF on neural stem cell proliferation, reactive astrogliosis inhibition, axonal regeneration or plasticity, neuroprotection against cell apoptosis, and body functional recovery. Most interestingly, GDNF demonstrated a bidirectional regulation of autophagy, which inhibited cell apoptosis at different stages of SCI. Furthermore, the HP hydrogel promoted the inhibition of autophagy-induced apoptosis by GDNF in SCI. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part A: 105A: 2816?2829, 2017.

AB  - Abstract Objective To investigate the feasibility of placing bi-cortical cortex (B-cort) or mono-cortical locking screws (M-lock) in a plate-rod construct applied to the feline tibia in combination with different intramedullary (IM) pins. Methods Twenty-four feline tibiae of cats were divided into 4 groups, corresponding to IM pin sizes filling approximately 30% (1.0 mm), 40% (1.4 mm), 45% (1.6 mm), and 50% (1.8 mm) of the medullary canal. Computed tomography (CT) was performed to trace potential screw trajectories in each group. A 12-hole, 2.4 mm locking compression plate was then applied on the medial aspect of the tibia. M-lock and B-cort screws were inserted subsequently in each plate hole. Success rates of screw insertion based on CT analysis and cadaveric simulation were compared with screw type, IM pin diameter, and anatomic location as variables. Results Screw insertion rates were underestimated on CT compared to cadaveric specimens. During cadaveric simulation, B-cort screws could be inserted in all specimens in the 3 most proximal plate holes and in at least 1 of the 3 distal plate holes. The smallest pin size (30%) allowed placement of a greater number of B-cort screws (P?<?.05) compared to other pins. Fewer B-cort screws could be inserted in the distal diaphyseal region (P?<?.05) compared to other regions. A total of 99.3% of M-lock screws could be inserted regardless of IMP size. Clinical significance Plate rod constructs can include bicortical screws in the proximal and distal metaphysis, and monocortical screws in the diaphysis, combined with an IM pin filling up to 50% of the medullary canal.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the minimum infusion rate (MIR) of alfaxalone required to prevent purposeful movement of the extremities in response to noxious stimulation. Study Design Prospective, experimental. Animals Eight healthy goats; four does and four wethers. Methods Anaesthesia was induced with alfaxalone 3 mg kg?1 intravenously (IV). A continuous IV infusion of alfaxalone, initially at 0.2 mg kg?1 minute?1, was initiated. Following endotracheal intubation the goats breathed spontaneously via a circle breathing circuit delivering supplementary oxygen. The initial infusion rate was maintained for 30 minutes before testing for responses. The stimulus was clamping on the proximal (soft) part of one digit of the hoof with Vulsellum forceps for 60 seconds. In the absence or presence of purposeful movement of the extremities, the infusion rate was reduced or increased by 0.02 mg kg?1 minute?1 and held constant for 30 minutes before claw-clamping again. Alfaxalone MIR was calculated as the mean of the infusion rates that allowed and abolished movement. Cardio-respiratory parameters were measured. Recovery from general anaesthesia was timed and quality scored. Results are presented as median (range). Results The MIR of alfaxalone was 0.16 (0.14?0.18) mg kg?1 minute?1 or 9.6 (8.4?10.8) mg kg?1 hour?1. Induction of and recovery from anaesthesia were excitement-free. Cardio-respiratory changes were minimal, although compared to baseline HR increased, and at 2 minutes post-induction, (prior to oxygen supplementation), PaO2 decreased significantly from 84 (80?88) to 70 (51?72) mmHg [11.2 (10.7?11.7) to 9.3 (6.8?9.6) kPa]. Sporadic muscle twitches, unrelated to depth of anaesthesia, were observed during the period of general anaesthesia. Time (minutes) to sternal recumbency and standing were 4.0 (3.0?10.0) and 41.5 (25.0?57.0) respectively. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance Alfaxalone can be used for total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) in goats and is associated with minimal adverse effects. Oxygen supplementation is advised, especially when working at higher altitudes.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare postoperative analgesia provided by a constant rate infusion (CRI) of dexmedetomidine (DMED) to that of a well-established positive control [morphine (MOR)] in critically ill dogs. The sedative, cardiorespiratory effects and clinical safety of a 24-hour DMED CRI were also evaluated. Study design? Prospective, randomised, blinded, positive-controlled parallel-group clinical study. Animals? Forty hospitalised, client-owned dogs requiring post-operative pain management after invasive surgery. Methods? After surgery, a loading dose of either DMED (25??g?m?2) or MOR (2500??g?m?2) followed by a 24-hour CRI of DMED (25??g?m?2?hour?1) or MOR (2500??g?m?2?hour?1) was administered. Pain was measured using the Short Form of the Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale, sedation and physiological variables were scored at regular intervals. Animals considered to be painful received rescue analgesia and were allocated to a post-rescue protocol; animals which were unresponsive to rescue analgesia were removed from the study. Data were analysed with anova, two-sample t-tests or Chi-square tests. Time to intervention was analysed with Kaplan?Meier methodology. Results? Forty dogs were enrolled. Twenty dogs (9 DMED and 11 MOR) did not require rescue analgesia. Eleven DMED and eight MOR dogs were allocated to the post-rescue protocol and seven of these removed from the study. Significant differences in pain scores between groups were not observed during the first 12?hours, however, DMED dogs were less (p?=?0.009) painful during the last 12?hours. Sedation score over the entire 24-hour study was not significantly different between groups. Conclusion?/?Clinical Relevance? Dexmedetomidine CRI was equally effective as MOR CRI at providing postoperative analgesia and no clinically significant adverse reactions were noted. This study shows the potential of DMED to contribute to a balanced postoperative analgesia regimen in dogs.

AB  - Objective? To determine cyclic biomechanical properties of gap osteotomized adult equine tibiae stabilized with an equine interlocking nail (EIN). Study Design? In vitro experimental biomechanical investigation. Sample Population? Thirteen adult equine cadaveric tibiae. Methods? Adult equine tibiae with transverse, midshaft, 1-cm gap osteotomies, stabilized with an equine interlocking nail, underwent cyclic biomechanical testing in vitro under axial compression, 4-point bending, and torsion. Different specimens were subjected to different load levels that represented estimated in vivo loads at 2 Hz for 740,000 cycles. Fatigue life and gap strain were calculated. Results? Compression and bending, but not torsional, fatigue life were longer than time necessary for bone healing. Compressive, but not bending or torsional, gap strains were small enough to be compatible with fracture healing by primary bone formation. Gap strains for compressive, bending, and torsional loads were compatible with indirect, or secondary, bone formation. Conclusions? Further modification should be made to the equine interlocking nail to increase bending stiffness and torsional fatigue life. Clinical Relevance? The stainless steel equine intramedullary interlocking nail is unlikely to provide appropriate long-term stability for fracture healing in adult equine tibiae without modifications in the nail design and material.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To evaluate multislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in hanging and manual strangulation cases and compare them with forensic autopsy results. Materials and Methods Postmortem MSCT and MRI of nine persons who died from hanging or manual strangulation were performed. The neck findings were compared with those discovered during forensic autopsy. In addition, two living patients underwent imaging and clinical examination following severe manual strangulation and near-hanging, respectively. For evaluation, the findings were divided into ?primary? (strangulation mark and subcutaneous desiccation (i.e., soft-tissue thinning as a result of tissue fluids being driven out by mechanical compression) in hanging, and subcutaneous and intramuscular hemorrhage in manual strangulation) and ?collateral? signs. The Wilcoxon two-tailed test was used for statistical analysis of the lymph node and salivary gland findings. Results In hanging, the primary and most frequent collateral signs were revealed by imaging. In manual strangulation, the primary findings were accurately depicted, with the exception of one slight hemorrhage. Apart from a vocal cord hemorrhage, all frequent collateral signs could be diagnosed radiologically. Traumatic lymph node hemorrhage (P = 0.031) was found in all of the manual strangulation cases. Conclusion MSCT and MRI revealed strangulation signs concordantly with forensic pathology findings. Imaging offers a great potential for the forensic examination of lesions due to strangulation in both clinical and postmortem settings. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2005. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
