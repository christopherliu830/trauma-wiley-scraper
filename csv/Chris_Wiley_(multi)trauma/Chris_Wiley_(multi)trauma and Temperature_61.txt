AB  - Abstract Objective To compare the effects of propofol and alfaxalone on respiration in cats. Study design Randomized, ?blinded?, prospective clinical trial. Animals Twenty cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Methods After premedication with medetomidine 0.01 mg kg?1 intramuscularly and meloxicam 0.3 mg kg?1 subcutaneously, the cats were assigned randomly into two groups: group A (n = 10) were administered alfaxalone 5 mg kg?1 minute?1 followed by 10 mg kg?1 hour?1 intravenously (IV) and group P (n = 10) were administered propofol 6 mg kg?1 minute?1 followed by 12 mg kg?1hour?1 IV for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia, respectively. After endotracheal intubation, the tube was connected to a non-rebreathing system delivering 100% oxygen. The anaesthetic maintenance drug rate was adjusted (± 0.5 mg kg?1 hour?1) every 5 minutes according to a scoring sheet based on physiologic variables and clinical signs. If apnoea > 30 seconds, end-tidal carbon dioxide (Pe?CO2) > 7.3 kPa (55 mmHg) or arterial haemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO2) < 90% occurred, manual ventilation was provided. Methadone was administered postoperatively. Data were analyzed using independent-samples t-tests, Fisher's exact test, linear mixed-effects models and binomial test. Results Manual ventilation was required in two and eight of the cats in group A and P, respectively (p = 0.02). Two cats in both groups showed apnoea. Pe?CO2 > 7.3 kPa was recorded in zero versus four and SpO2 < 90% in zero versus six cats in groups A and P respectively. Induction and maintenance dose rates (mean ± SD) were 11.6 ± 0.3 mg kg?1 and 10.7 ± 0.8 mg kg?1 hour?1 for alfaxalone and 11.7 ± 2.7 mg kg?1 and 12.4 ± 0.5 mg kg?1 hour?1 for propofol. Conclusion and clinical relevance Alfaxalone had less adverse influence on respiration than propofol in cats premedicated with medetomidine. Alfaxalone might be better than propofol for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia when artificial ventilation cannot be provided.

AB  - Objective? To determine cyclic biomechanical properties of gap osteotomized adult equine tibiae stabilized with an equine interlocking nail (EIN). Study Design? In vitro experimental biomechanical investigation. Sample Population? Thirteen adult equine cadaveric tibiae. Methods? Adult equine tibiae with transverse, midshaft, 1-cm gap osteotomies, stabilized with an equine interlocking nail, underwent cyclic biomechanical testing in vitro under axial compression, 4-point bending, and torsion. Different specimens were subjected to different load levels that represented estimated in vivo loads at 2 Hz for 740,000 cycles. Fatigue life and gap strain were calculated. Results? Compression and bending, but not torsional, fatigue life were longer than time necessary for bone healing. Compressive, but not bending or torsional, gap strains were small enough to be compatible with fracture healing by primary bone formation. Gap strains for compressive, bending, and torsional loads were compatible with indirect, or secondary, bone formation. Conclusions? Further modification should be made to the equine interlocking nail to increase bending stiffness and torsional fatigue life. Clinical Relevance? The stainless steel equine intramedullary interlocking nail is unlikely to provide appropriate long-term stability for fracture healing in adult equine tibiae without modifications in the nail design and material.

AB  - Abstract Wegener?s Granulomatosis is a necrotizing vasculitis that in its most severe form can cause respiratory failure, renal failure and subglottic stenosis requiring surgical airway access. We describe the use of portable extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and the long distance road transport of a patient with Wegener?s Granulomatosis who developed respiratory failure that was refractory to conventional mechanical ventilation. We have demonstrated the effective use of portable extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for stabilization and safe acute interhospital transfer over a long distance by road ambulance to a tertiary centre for further management.

AB  - Abstract The repair of nerves remains a major challenge in neuron-regeneration. In this study, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (PLGA/MWCNTs) nanofibrous scaffolds were fabricated by electrospinning method. The surface morphology, physical, and mechanical properties were characterized through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy, and tensile tests, respectively. SEM analysis, Live/Dead staining, immunostaining assays were performed to evaluate neural cells growth. Blending PLGA with MWCNTs resulted in increase diameter and porosity of the scaffolds, and exhibited better mechanical properties. The results demonstrated that the scaffolds with higher MWCNTs concentration provided better survival for neural cells after 8 days of culture, especially for astrocytes growth. This could be useful in treating the disease like multiple sclerosis that causing central nervous system demyelination and axonal injury. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objectives As mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be isolated easily from adipose tissues while retaining their self-renewal and multi-potential differentiation capacities, they hold promising possibilities for being applied extensively in tissue engineering. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family members have been reported to provide instructive signals to MSCs for them to differentiate into several different cell lineages. The study described here aims to investigate whether BMP-4 could promote adipose-derived stem cell (ASC) differentiation into adipocytes under various concentrations. Materials and methods ASCs were isolated from mouse inguinal adipose pads and cultured in vitro. 10 ng/ml and 50 ng/ml BMP-4 were added to adipogenic media for 8 days. Oil red-O staining, reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction and immunocytofluorescence staining were performed to examine differentiation of the ASCs. Results As indicated by increased expression of adipogenic and lipogenic genes (PPAR-?, APN and LPL) and proteins, 50 ng/ml BMP-4 seemed to induce mASCs to differentiate into the adipo-lineage compared to 10 ng/ml BMP-4, and control groups. In addition, lipid droplets accumulated within the adipocytes under 50 ng/ml BMP-4 stimulation, as shown by oil red-O staining. Conclusions Our present study suggests that BMP-4, as an adipo-inducing factor, promoted adipogenesis of ASCs at higher concentrations (50 ng/ml) and can perhaps be considered as a candidate for use in adipose tissue engineering.

AB  - Background Anecdotal reports suggest a recent high prevalence of aspiration pneumonia in Irish wolfhounds, prompting further investigation into the incidence of the disease in this breed. Objectives To investigate the possibility that Irish wolfhounds have an increased incidence of aspiration pneumonia, and to consider possible predisposing causes in this breed. Methods Retrospective review of medical records from the Small Animal Specialist Hospital, Sydney, from January 2008 to December 2012 inclusive to determine the total hospital incidence and individual breed incidences of aspiration pneumonia. Results The total hospital incidence of aspiration pneumonia was 0?·?5%. The Irish wolfhound had the highest breed incidence, with 9 of 25 dogs (36%) diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. Four of the Irish wolfhounds had a predisposing cause identified; one having a choking episode, one having gastric bloat, while two were diagnosed with laryngeal paralysis after it was specifically investigated because of clinical suspicion. Five had no underlying cause of their aspiration pneumonia determined. Clinical Significance On the basis of the hospital population studied, the Irish wolfhound has a high incidence of aspiration pneumonia. Further investigation into the possible predisposing cause(s) in this breed is warranted.

AB  - Abstract Background Effective management of minor ailments in community pharmacies could reduce the burden on alternative high-cost services (general practices, Emergency Departments). Evidence is needed regarding the appropriateness of management of these conditions in community pharmacies. Objective To explore the appropriateness of minor ailment management in community pharmacies. Setting Prospective, observational study of simulated patient (SP) visits to community pharmacies in Grampian (Scotland) and East Anglia (England). Method Eighteen pharmacies (nine per centre) were recruited within a 25-mile radius of Aberdeen or Norwich. Consultations for four minor ailments were evaluated: back pain; vomiting/diarrhoea; sore throat; and eye discomfort. Each pharmacy received one SP visit per ailment (four visits/pharmacy; 72 visits total). Visits were audio-recorded and SPs completed a data collection form immediately after each visit. Primary Outcome Measure Each SP consultation was assessed for appropriateness against product licence, practice guidelines and study-specific consensus standards developed by a multi-disciplinary consensus panel. Results Evaluable data were available for 68/72 (94.4%) visits. Most (96%) visits resulted in the sale of a product; advice alone was the outcome of three visits. All product sales complied with the product licence, 52 (76%) visits complied with practice guidelines and seven visits achieved a ?basic? standard according to the consensus standard. Conclusion Appropriateness of care varied according to the standard used. Pharmacy-specific quality standards are needed which are realistic and relevant to the pharmacy context and which reflect legal and clinical guidelines to promote the safe and effective management of minor ailments in this setting.

AB  - Flamingos are estimated to be present in at least two-thirds of European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) institutions. In total, 8837 flamingos in 168 institutions, including 164 EAZA zoos and four Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust centres were reported as at 1 January 2010. Around 93% (8214) of the flamingos reported were the three Phoenicopterus spp: Greater flamingo Phoenicopterus roseus, Caribbean flamingo Phoenicopterus ruber and Chilean flamingo Phoenicopterus chilensis. These three species are included in the EAZA Ciconiiformes and Phoenicopteriformes Regional Collection Plan (RCP), along with the Lesser flamingo Phoeniconaias minor. All four species are managed in the lowest RCP category, ?Monitor by TAG?, as efforts currently focus on broad-scale issues at the zoo/group level. Answers to a survey demonstrated that EAZA zoos would like to hold many more flamingos than are currently available. The Taxon Advisory Group has adopted 11 strategies to improve the conditions and breeding of flamingos in captivity. For example, to improve breeding results zoos are encouraged to have only a single flamingo species in an enclosure, to balance sex ratios in groups and to keep full-flighted flamingos. Health problems as well as predator and trauma mortality are also discussed in this paper. The Fabulous Flamingo Survey is being repeated at 5 year intervals in order to monitor progress and adjust strategies.

AB  - Abstract History CaridianBCT apheresis machines require a ~285 mL priming volume (extracorporeal blood) that is withdrawn from the patient in ~10 minutes. Therefore, apheresis in dogs has generally been limited to dogs > ~20 kg to assure <20% of the blood volume is removed in the priming phase. Animals/physical examination Three dogs weighing <14 kg (13.6, 10.5, and 9.9 kg) with lymphoma that underwent apheresis. Management The dogs were premedicated for placement of apheresis catheters with hydromorphone (0.1 mg kg?1) IM. Anesthesia was induced with propofol, to effect, intravenously and general anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. Following catheter placement, dogs were allowed to recover from isoflurane but were kept sedated with either a dexmedetomidine constant rate infusion (CRI) or a propofol CRI. Real time autologous blood priming was not performed in any of the dogs. Instead, priming solutions were composed of a combination of hetastarch, lactated Ringer's solution, and/or autologous blood that was harvested 4 days before the procedure. During apheresis, dogs received anticoagulant citrate-dextrose, solution-A (ACD-A) to prevent clotting and 10% calcium gluconate as needed to maintain normal ionized calcium concentrations. Dogs were monitored for cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary stability, anemia and lactic acidosis. Follow-up All of the dogs had cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary values within clinically acceptable ranges. Immediately following apheresis all of the dogs were mildly to moderately anemic (PCV; 17?35%) although none of the dogs required a transfusion or had an increased lactate concentration. Conclusions Dogs as small as 9.9 kg can successfully undergo apheresis with a variety of priming solutions. Dexmedetomidine or propofol given as a CRI provides sufficient sedation for this procedure.

AB  - Abstract Concern about the use of nanomaterials has increased significantly in recent years due to potentially hazardous impacts on human health. Mast cells are critical for innate and adaptive immune responses, often modulating allergic and pathogenic conditions. Mast cells are well known to act in response to danger signals through a variety of receptors and pathways including IL-33 and the IL-1-like receptor ST2. Here, the involvement of mast cells and the IL-33/ST2 axis in pulmonary and cardiovascular responses to multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) exposure are examined. Toxicological effects of MWCNTs are observed only in mice with a sufficient population of mast cells and are not observed when mast cells are absent or incapable of responding to IL-33. Our findings establish for the first time that mast cells and the IL-33/ST2 axis orchestrates adverse pulmonary and cardiovascular responses to an engineered nanomaterial, giving insight into a previously unknown mechanism of toxicity. This novel mechanism of toxicity could be used for assessing the safety of engineered nanomaterials and provides a realistic therapeutic target for potential nanoparticle induced toxicities.

AB  - Background and Objectives? Transfusion of autologous whole blood is one available method to reduce the need for allogenic blood transfusion. The objective of this study was to investigate the safety of transfusion of intra-operative autologous whole blood by monitoring plasma concentration of laboratory variables and adverse events after transfusion with the Sangvia? system. Materials and Methods? The clinical trial was designed as an open, prospective, multi-centre study, and a total of 20 patients undergoing primary hip arthroplasty were included. Systemic blood samples were taken and analysed preoperatively, at transfusion start and end and at 3, 6, 24 and 48?h after the transfusion. Results? Elevated values of complement activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines were seen in the intra-operatively collected blood but the impact on systemic levels were limited with low peak levels, systemic elevations before transfusion and normalization during the study period. Elevated levels of free haemoglobin and potassium were also detected in the intra-operatively collected blood, but systemic values were within reference values after the transfusion. No clinically relevant adverse event occurred during the study. Conclusion? Inflammatory mediators and plasma haemoglobin were increased in intra-operatively salvaged and filtered blood compared to circulatory levels. Intra-operative retransfusion of autologous whole blood caused a transient systemic increase that normalized in the early postoperative period. There were no significant adverse events reported in the study. These data suggest that the Sangvia? system can be used for intra-operative collection and retransfusion of salvaged blood.

AB  - This is the author's third revision of a geriatrics bibliography. Approximately two thirds of the old references have been replaced by more current or more detailed articles. The bibliography has been expanded to include several additional topics and over 250 new references from 135 different journals. Because the literature pertinent to geriatrics has continued to grow ever more rapidly, it has been necessary to omit many informative articles from the bibliography. Preference is given to recent publications; almost all of the references date from the past four years. Some articles were selected to highlight current controversies or changes in viewpoint. An occasional unrefereed article is cited to amplify geriatric aspects of common diseases. Most of the references deal specifically with an elderly patient population, though few use a multidisciplinary approach. Studies of the elderly are confounded by the concomitants of aging frequent but not universal in our society: inactivity, obesity, malnutrition, and psychosocial trauma. The articles cited concern primarily medical ailments of the elderly but legal, ethical, and sociologic topics are also covered. The references are divided into categories. The first (I) set deals with some possible causes of aging, the second (II) with physiologic decline accompanying aging, the third (III) with the atypical and nonspecific characteristics of illness among geriatric patients, the fourth (IV) with the elderly and society, and the fifth (V) with care options. The remainder of the references are cited by pertinent medical specialty. Within each category, references are divided by disease process. Articles are further subgrouped by aspects of those diseases such as evaluation or therapy.

AB  - Aim? To evaluate longer term outcomes of a quality improvement strategy in transfusion. Method? A Clinical Health Improvement Program (CHIP) quality improvement project was conducted in a 290 bed acute general hospital, to decrease the rate of transfusions with high pre-transfusion haemoglobins. Strategies for improvement included: formation of a Transfusion Committee; development of transfusion pathway; implementation of a Maximum Blood Order Schedule; educational strategies targeting clinical staff at all levels; promulgation of the NHRMC Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Use of Blood Components; and feedback to clinicians. The CHIP project was superseded by the ACT Haemovigilance Project, and an ACT wide concurrent transfusion audit was undertaken. There was no formal feedback on clinician performance during, or for 6?months prior to, the Haemovigilance audit. Red cell transfusion was assessed for compliance with the NHMRC Guidelines and compared with CHIP results. Result? The CHIP project demonstrated successful implementation of the selected strategies, leading to a reduction in transfusions with pre-transfusion haemoglobins greater than 90?g/L. Follow up auditing commencing six months later demonstrated a progressive, and statistically significant, increase in inappropriate transfusions over the following six months. Conclusion? Although improvement in transfusion practice was demonstrated with a multi-factorial approach to quality improvement, the improvement was not sustained in the medium term. Our results indicate the need for organisational commitment to long term quality improvement strategies in transfusion, and support the development of Transfusion Officers or Nurses to improve bedside clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine meropenem concentrations in radiocarpal (RC) joint fluid and plasma after intravenous regional limb perfusion (IVRLP). Study design In vivo experimental study. Animals Nine healthy adult mares. Methods Meropenem (500 mg) was injected in the forelimb of standing sedated horses via IVRLP with a pneumatic tourniquet inflated to 400 mmHg. Synovial fluid was collected from RC joints at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 18 hours after meropenem injection. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein at the same time points and at 5 and 15 minutes following injection. Meropenem concentrations were determined by using a microbiological bioassay. Results Median synovial fluid concentrations reached a time of maximum synovial fluid concentration 0.5 hours after IVRLP. Synovial fluid concentrations varied greatly, with a mean maximum synovial fluid concentration of 25.6 µg/mL (range, below limit of quantitation to 75.5). Concentrations remained above the breakpoint for susceptibility (1 µg/mL) for 3 hours (last nonzero concentration measured, median) and 4.1 hours (predicted, mean). Concentrations >6 µg/mL were measured for 2 hours (observed, median) and 1.7 hours (predicted, mean). Six horses had mild swelling at the injection site. Conclusion Administration of 500 mg meropenem resulted in highly variable concentrations between horses and achieved levels above clinically relevant minimum inhibitory concentration for a minor portion of a once-daily dosing interval. Clinical significance If time-dependent pharmacodynamics apply, IVRLP with 500 mg of meropenem may be ineffective and would likely promote resistance.
