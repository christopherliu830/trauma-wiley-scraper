AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the agreement between cardiac output (CO) values obtained using a transpulmonary thermodilution technique (TPTDCO) and conventional thermodilution technique (TDCO) in anaesthetized dogs with fluid overload. Study design Prospective experimental study. Animals Six healthy Beagle dogs aged 7?8 years. Methods Dogs were anaesthetized with sevoflurane in oxygen, and catheters were inserted for TPTDCO and TDCO measurement. After instrumentation, baseline CO was measured using each technique at a central venous pressure (CVP) of 3?7 mmHg. Dogs were subsequently administered lactated Ringer's solution and 6% hydroxyethyl starch to induce fluid overload. CO measurements were obtained using each technique at CVP values of 8?12 mmHg, 13?17 mmHg, 18?22 mmHg and 23?27 mmHg. Agreements between CO measurements obtained with the respective techniques were analysed using Dunnett's test, Pearson's correlation coefficient and Bland?Altman analysis. Results Thirty pairs of CO values were obtained, ranging from 1.45 L minute?1 to 4.69 L minute?1 for TPTDCO and from 1.30 L minute?1 to 4.61 L minute?1 for TDCO. TPTDCO and TDCO values correlated strongly (r2 = 0.915, p < 0.001). The bias and mean relative bias between TPTDCO and TDCO were 0.26 ± 0.30 L minute?1 (limits of agreement ? 0.29 to 0.81 L minute?1) and 9.7%, respectively. Conclusions and clinical relevance TPTDCO and TDCO measurements obtained in anaesthetized dogs during fluid overload exhibited good agreement. Accordingly, transpulmonary thermodilution provides an accurate measurement of CO in dogs with fluid overload.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To analyse the association between time from triage to administration of initial antibiotics and mortality in all patients presenting with sepsis to a tertiary hospital ED. Methods A retrospective review of patients presenting to the ED with sepsis from January to December 2012 was conducted at Flinders Medical Centre, South Australia. Outcome measures were: time elapsed from triage to administration of initial antibiotic therapy and in-hospital mortality. Results A total of 220 patients presented with sepsis, comprising 102 cases of uncomplicated sepsis and 118 severe sepsis. The median time to antibiotic administration was 3.5?h (interquartile range [IQR] 1.7?6.6) and in-hospital mortality was 28.6% (95% CI 22.6?34.6%). There was no association observed between delays to antibiotics and mortality in the total patient population. When stratified by presenting severity, patients with severe sepsis demonstrated a trend towards increased mortality when delays to antibiotics exceeded 6 h from triage (HR = 2.25, 95% CI 0.91?5.59, P = 0.08) in comparison with <1?h. Significant delays to antibiotic administration occurred when initial agents were charted as a ?regular medicine? (9.4?h, IQR 5.1?16.6) in comparison with a ?once only order? (3.4?h, IQR 1.7?6.7), P < 0.001. Conclusions Early administration of antibiotics specifically in patients with severe sepsis might be beneficial. Further studies within the ED are warranted to establish the effect of delayed antibiotics in a generalised sepsis cohort.

AB  - Abstract Objective The aim of this study was to describe the in-event, ambulance and ED impacts of patient presentations from an Australian mass gathering event (MGE) including patient demographics, provision of care, length of stay and discharge disposition. Methods This research was set at one MGE in Australia. The MGE had one first aid post and one in-event health team staffed by doctors, nurses and paramedics. A retrospective analysis of patient care records from providers of in-event, ambulance and ED services was undertaken. Data analysis included descriptive and inferential statistics. Results Of the 20?000 MGE participants, 197 (0.99% [95% CI 0.86?1.13], 9.85/1000) presented for in-event first aid care, with 24/197 (12.2% [95% CI 8.33?17.49], 1.2/1000) referred to in-event health professionals. Fifteen of the referred patients (62.5% [95% CI 42.71?78.84]) returned to the MGE following administration of intravenous fluids (n?=?13) and/or anti-emetics (n?=?11). Seven (29.2% [95% CI 14.92?49.17], 0.35/1000) were referred to ambulance paramedic care, requiring endotracheal intubation (n?=?1) and airway adjuncts (n = 3) prior to transportation to ED; these patients had an ED median length of stay of 7 h (5.5?12.5) receiving imaging and ventilator support. Five were discharged from ED, one required an operation and another required intensive care unit admission. Conclusions There was an impact on in-event, ambulance and ED services from this MGE but the in-event model of care may have limited ambulance usage and ED visits. The ED length of stay was greater than the national median, perhaps reflecting the appropriateness of transport and nature of care requirements while in the ED.

AB  - Abstract This brief review focuses on coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and valve surgery and their post-operative effects on cognitive domains. Despite the substantial technical advances in cardiac surgery over the past few decades, the incidence of permanent cognitive impairment remains alarmingly high: 20?70 per cent of patients exhibit cognitive impairment during the first week after surgery, with the incidence declining to 10?40 per cent after 6 weeks and remaining at this level thereafter. We find that language, concentration and motor control are most consistently reported to be affected, while memory, attention and executive function are more variably affected. Valve surgery is generally associated with a worse outcome than CABG surgery. It remains unclear whether the use of the cardio-pulmonary bypass machine adversely affects cognitive outcome. There is an urgent need to identify the risk factors and surgical techniques that influence post-operative cognitive impairment, yet it is difficult to reach meaningful conclusions from the present data due to a lack of concordance in experimental design and data analysis. To address this challenge, future research will need to control for confounds such as mood state, post-operative pain, learning effects, and anaesthesia and will need to compare a wide range of cognitive domains and surgical procedures within large multi-centre studies.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine meropenem concentrations in radiocarpal (RC) joint fluid and plasma after intravenous regional limb perfusion (IVRLP). Study design In vivo experimental study. Animals Nine healthy adult mares. Methods Meropenem (500 mg) was injected in the forelimb of standing sedated horses via IVRLP with a pneumatic tourniquet inflated to 400 mmHg. Synovial fluid was collected from RC joints at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 18 hours after meropenem injection. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein at the same time points and at 5 and 15 minutes following injection. Meropenem concentrations were determined by using a microbiological bioassay. Results Median synovial fluid concentrations reached a time of maximum synovial fluid concentration 0.5 hours after IVRLP. Synovial fluid concentrations varied greatly, with a mean maximum synovial fluid concentration of 25.6 µg/mL (range, below limit of quantitation to 75.5). Concentrations remained above the breakpoint for susceptibility (1 µg/mL) for 3 hours (last nonzero concentration measured, median) and 4.1 hours (predicted, mean). Concentrations >6 µg/mL were measured for 2 hours (observed, median) and 1.7 hours (predicted, mean). Six horses had mild swelling at the injection site. Conclusion Administration of 500 mg meropenem resulted in highly variable concentrations between horses and achieved levels above clinically relevant minimum inhibitory concentration for a minor portion of a once-daily dosing interval. Clinical significance If time-dependent pharmacodynamics apply, IVRLP with 500 mg of meropenem may be ineffective and would likely promote resistance.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To evaluate the effects of propofol, on isoflurane minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) and cardiovascular function in mechanically ventilated goats. Study design? Prospective, randomized, crossover experimental study. Animals? Six goats, three does and three wethers. Methods? General anaesthesia was induced with isoflurane in oxygen. Following endotracheal intubation, anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation was applied. Baseline isoflurane MAC was determined, the noxious stimulus used being clamping a claw. The goats then received, on separate occasions, three propofol treatments intravenously: bolus of 0.5?mg?kg?1 followed by a constant rate infusion (CRI) of 0.05?mg?kg?1?minute?1 (treatment LPROP); bolus of 1.0?mg?kg?1 followed by a CRI of 0.1?mg?kg?1?minute?1 (treatment MPROP), bolus of 2.0?mg?kg?1 followed by a CRI of 0.2?mg?kg?1?minute?1 (treatment HPROP). Isoflurane MAC was re-determined following propofol treatments. Plasma propofol concentrations at the time of MAC confirmation were measured. Cardiopulmonary parameters were monitored throughout the anaesthetic period. Quality of recovery was scored. The Friedman test was used to test for differences between isoflurane MACs. Medians of repeatedly measured cardiovascular parameters were tested for differences between and within treatments using repeated anova by ranks (p?<?0.05 for statistical significance). Results? Isoflurane MAC [median (interquartile range)] was 1.37 (1.36?1.37) vol%. Propofol CRI significantly reduced the isoflurane MAC, to 1.15 (1.08?1.15), 0.90 (0.87?0.93) and 0.55 (0.49?0.58) vol% following LPROP, MPROP and HPROP treatment, respectively. Increasing plasma propofol concentrations strongly correlated (Spearman rank correlation) with decrease in MAC (Rho?=?0.91). Cardiovascular function was not affected significantly by propofol treatment. Quality of recovery was satisfactory. Conclusions and clinical relevance? In goats, propofol reduces isoflurane MAC in a dose-dependent manner with minimal cardiovascular effects.

AB  - Summary Background During 2016?2018, 15 critically ill neonatal foals with acute respiratory distress associated with Chlamydia psittaci infection were presented to three referral hospitals in New South Wales. Chlamydia psittaci has not previously been associated with the development of neonatal respiratory disease. Objectives To investigate and describe the clinical features and outcome of C. psittaci infection in neonatal foals. Study design Multicentre retrospective case series. Methods The clinical, clinicopathological, necropsy and histological features of 15 foals with confirmed C. psittaci infection were reviewed and reported. Results Thirteen foals with C. psittaci infection died or were subjected to euthanasia within 36 h of hospitalisation and two foals survived to discharge. Findings during post-mortem examination of nonsurviving foals included bronchopneumonia, pulmonary congestion, hepatic congestion and hepatic inflammation. Detection of C. psittaci was achieved using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of swabs of nasal secretions (4/6) and rectal mucosa (5/7) from live foals, lung tissues of foals at necropsy (11/14) and foetal membranes (4/5). Main limitations Small numbers of confirmed cases of neonatal C. psittaci infection and inconsistent sampling methods. Conclusions Chlamydia psittaci should be considered a differential diagnosis for neonatal foals with signs of severe systemic disease, including equine neonatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (EqNARDS). Chlamydia psittaci is a zoonotic pathogen and a personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn for the management of foals with suspected or confirmed infection.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides a brief overview of some of the equipment needed for the interventional endoscopy (IE) procedures. A C-arm fluoroscopy unit is ideal for most IE procedures. Lithotripsy is performed for stone removal. For larger stone burdens intracorporeal lithotripsy is recommended. This can be done using laser, electrohydraulic, ultrasonic, pneumatic, and/or intracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy. The stents most commonly used in IE cases are either metallic or polyurethane. A subcutaneous ureteral bypass device (SUB) is currently placed with surgical-assistance under fluoroscopic guidance. Setting up an IE suite requires meticulous organization. When setting up for an IE procedure it is important that the operator has all the equipment necessary, the procedure is well thought out, and the room is appropriately organized. The operator should have more than one wire, catheter, needle, balloon, laser fiber, basket, available in the event one breaks, gets contaminated, or becomes difficult to use over time.

AB  - Abstract Divalent manganese ion (Mn2+) has been reported to be a useful contrast agent for functional MRI, through a technique named activity-induced manganese-dependent MRI (AIM). In AIM, signal enhancement is related to functional increases in calcium influx, and therefore AIM is, thus far, the only MRI method able to map brain activation in vivo independently of the surrogate hemodynamic changes used in functional MRI. Because of its high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and high sensitivity, AIM allows the use of multi-slice or three-dimensional MRI techniques to map functional activity at high spatial resolution. In the present review, we define AIM as a functional MRI tool based on the administration of divalent ionized manganese through an open or disrupted blood?brain barrier (BBB). The adequacy and efficacy of AIM in detecting neural activation is described in light of supporting experiments on inhibition of calcium channels, FOS expression, and on direct comparison to BOLD- and perfusion-based functional MRI. Two main applications of AIM, mapping brain activation in rat somatosensory cortex, as well stroke research based on the well-established middle cerebral artery occlusion model, are described in detail. Methodological problems associated with a strong dependence on anesthetic conditions, potential corruption due to disruption of the BBB, and unspecific increase of the baseline signal due to acoustical noise are discussed. Finally, recommended preparation methods and experimental protocols for AIM are introduced. Copyright ? 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To investigate the effect of acepromazine (ACP) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by stimulated equine neutrophils. Study design? Ex vivo biochemical experiments. Animals? Isolated neutrophils from healthy untreated horses. Methods? Neutrophils were incubated with ACP at concentrations of 10?4, 10?5 or 10?6?m and then stimulated with phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA) before measurement of lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence (CL). In a second experiment neutrophils were incubated in the presence of α-keto-? methylthiobutyric acid (KMB) and treated with ACP at concentrations of 10?4, 10?5 or 10?6?m. Subsequent PMA stimulation lead to neutrophilic ROS production and decomposition of KMB to ethylene, which is measured by gas chromatography. Electron paramagnetic resonance-spin trapping (EPR) analysis was performed with PMA-stimulated neutrophils in the presence of ACP (10?4, 10?5 or 10?6?m) directly added to the cell suspension. In the second experiment, the same concentrations of ACP were pre-incubated with neutrophils, then centrifuged to eliminate the excess of ACP and re-suspended in phosphate buffer before stimulation with PMA. In all experiments, the results of ACP-treated and ACP-untreated stimulated neutrophils were compared. Results? Overall, results obtained with lucigenin-enhanced CL and KMB oxidation were in agreement with those seen in electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Acepromazine induced a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on neutrophilic ROS production. Electron paramagnetic resonance also showed, at high ACP concentration, the appearance of a cation radical derived from ACP. In contrast, electron paramagnetic resonance study performed with pre-incubated neutrophils showed an important dose-dependent inhibitory effect of ACP. Conclusion? The results indicate that ACP can neutralize O??2 or its by-products during the stimulation of neutrophils. Clinical relevance? These findings may have a therapeutic relevance when phenothiazines are used in horses suffering from inflammatory diseases in which neutrophil activation and ROS production are implicated.

AB  - Objectives To determine whether methadone, administered before orthopaedic surgery, results in improved postoperative analgesia compared to buprenorphine. Methods Thirty-eight dogs undergoing orthopaedic surgeries (the majority being tibial tuberosity advancement or elbow arthrotomy) were premedicated with 0?·?03?mg/kg acepromazine and either 20?µg/kg buprenorphine or 0?·?5?mg/kg methadone, intramuscularly, allocated randomly. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol intravenously to effect and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. 0?·?2?mg/kg meloxicam was administered at anaesthetic induction. Sedation was assessed by means of a dynamic interactive visual analogue and simple descriptive scales and pain by dynamic interactive visual analogue and the short form Glasgow composite pain scales, by a single observer blinded to treatment group at intervals for 8?hours following premedication. Results Sedation scores were higher than baseline in both groups following premedication until the end of the assessment period (P?=?0?·?0001), with no differences between groups. Pain scores were lower overall in dogs premedicated with methadone (dynamic interactive visual analogue scale P?=?0?·?048; short form Glasgow composite pain scale P?=?0?·?0045), and these dogs required less additional analgesia (42%, compared to 79% premedicated with buprenorphine, P?=?0?·?045). Clinical Significance At the doses investigated, methadone produced superior analgesia to buprenorphine for 8?hours postoperatively in dogs undergoing orthopaedic surgery.

AB  - Summary A significant proportion of the mortality and morbidity of severe burns is attributable to the ensuing hypermetabolic response that typically lasts for at least 9?12 months post-injury. This is associated with impaired wound healing, increased infection risks, erosion of lean body mass, hampered rehabilitation and delayed reintegration of burn survivors into society. The endocrine status is markedly altered during this period with an initial and then sustained increase in proinflammatory ?stress? hormones such as cortisol and other glucocorticoids, and catecholamines including epinephrine and norepinephrine by the adrenal medulla and cortex. These hormones exert catabolic effects leading to muscle wasting, the intensity of which depends upon the percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) involved, as well as the time elapsed since initial injury. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies may be used to reverse the catabolic effect of thermal injury. Of these, ?-adrenergic blockade with propranolol has been the most efficacious anti-catabolic therapy in the treatment of burns. The underlying mechanism of action of propranolol is still unclear, however its effect appears to occur due to an increased protein synthesis in the face of a persistent protein breakdown and reduced peripheral lipolysis. This article aims to review the current understanding of catecholamines in postburn muscle wasting and focuses on the clinical and metabolic effects of ?-blockade in severe burns.

AB  - BACKGROUND Many transfusion services determine the titer of potentially incompatible plasma-containing products by performing a one-dilution titer at their selected titer threshold. This study compared the results of immediate spin (IS) one-dilution titers determined by three methods with a reference standard method. METHODS Plasma-containing products from group A and O donors were titered using the participant's routine IS one-dilution titer method. No time or temperature incubations were performed, and antihuman globulin reagent was not used. The samples were then tested using a reference method, which was a saline tube test with a 1-hour room temperature incubation; antihuman globulin was not used in the reference method. The results of the one-dilution titer were then compared to that obtained in the reference method. RESULTS Nine centers participated in this study. There were 698 antibodies from 374 units tested by the manual IS tube one-dilution titer method; sensitivity was 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83?0.92), and specificity was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.98?1.00). There were 412 antibodies from 206 units tested by the manual and automated IS buffered gel card one-dilution titer method; sensitivity was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91?0.98), and specificity was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.81?0.91). There were 98 antibodies from 49 units tested by an automated microplate IS one-dilution titer method; sensitivity was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71?0.93), and specificity was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.92?0.99). All three methods had an accuracy rate of 90% or greater. CONCLUSION The manual and automated one-dilution titer methods are suitable for screening plasma-containing units, although more evaluation of the automated microplate method might be required.

AB  - Abstract The most common errors in the diagnosis of dementia are underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis. Underdiagnosis is best avoided by careful use of psychometric screening tests to detect cognitive impairment in patients unaware of their own defect. Overdiagnosis can be avoided by not applying the label of ?dementia? until the diagnosis is unequivocal. Complete evaluation is necessary to rule out treatable causes of dementia, and should include medical, neurological, and psychiatric history and examination, simple psychometric tests, laboratory battery, computerized transaxial tomographic brain scan, and electroencephalogram. Ultimately, the diagnosis of dementia may change at follow-up examination, and the unequivocal diagnosis of a specific form of dementia still requires autopsy and neuropathological examination of the brain. The most common causes of cognitive impairment in the elderly include Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, depression, and other specific illnesses such as tumors, Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease, and normal pressure hydrocephalus. Even systemic disease can present as dementia. The evaluation outlined above may help distinguish among these causes. New diagnostic techniques may eventually be helpful as well.

AB  - Abstract Despite recent advance in bioinspired adhesives, achieving strong adhesion and sealing hemostasis in aqueous and blood environments is challenging. A hyperbranched polymer (HBP) with a hydrophobic backbone and hydrophilic adhesive catechol side branches is designed and synthesized based on Michael addition reaction of multi-vinyl monomers with dopamine. It is demonstrated that upon contacting water, the hydrophobic chains self-aggregate to form coacervates quickly, displacing water molecules on the adherent surface to trigger increased exposure of catechol groups and thus rapidly strong adhesion to diverse materials from low surface energy to high energy in various environments, such as deionized water, sea water, PBS, and a wide range of pH solutions (pH = 3 to 11) without use of any oxidant. Also, this HBP adhesive (HBPA) exhibits a robust adhesion to fractured bone, precluding the problem of mismatched surface energy and mechanical properties. The HBPA's adhesion is repeatable in a wet condition. Intriguingly, the HBPA is capable of gluing dissimilar materials with distinct properties. Importantly, introducing long alkylamine into this modular hyperbranched architecture contributes to formation of an injectable hemostatic sealant that can rapidly stop visceral bleeding, especially hemorrhage from deep wound.

AB  - ABSTRACT Integrins are cell surface receptors that form the link between extracellular matrix molecules of the cell environment and internal cell signalling and the cytoskeleton. They are involved in several processes, e.g. adhesion and migration during development and repair. This review focuses on the role of integrins in axonal regeneration. Integrins participate in spontaneous axonal regeneration in the peripheral nervous system through binding to various ligands that either inhibit or enhance their activation and signalling. Integrin biology is more complex in the central nervous system. Integrins receptors are transported into growing axons during development, but selective polarised transport of integrins limits the regenerative response in adult neurons. Manipulation of integrins and related molecules to control their activation state and localisation within axons is a promising route towards stimulating effective regeneration in the central nervous system.

AB  - Introduction: The biochemical consequence of acute obstructive uropathy can alter the hemodynamic profile. The objectives of this study were to determine the arterial blood pressure at presentation of male cats with acute urethral obstruction and to correlate these measurements with concurrent metabolic abnormalities. Study Design: Prospective research study in a private small animal after-hours emergency clinic. The subjects were client owned male cats presented with acute urethral obstruction and no other known concurrent disease. Measurements: Indirect oscillometric blood pressure measurements of urethral obstructed male cats were obtained at admission prior to blood sampling and treatment. Data recorded and studied: mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), physical examination parameters, serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, potassium, phosphorus, total calcium and magnesium concentration, venous pH, electrocardiogram lead II, and urine volume in bladder. Results: Twenty-eight cats were included in the study. Using normal values for MAP in cats, the results fell into 2 groups: normotensive (MAP 90?140?mmHg) and hypertensive (MAP>140?mmHg). Seventy-one percent (20/28) were considered normotensive (mean 113±14.6?mmHg). Twenty-nine percent (8/28) were considered hypertensive (mean 154±9.8?mmHg). In the normotensive group, the mean body temperature was 37.6±1.5°C, the mean heart rate was 179±42.2/min, and 64% (9/20) had an abnormal cardiac rhythm. In the hypertensive group, the mean body temperature was 38.3±0.6°C, the mean heart rate was 219±18.0/min, and all had normal cardiac rhythm. In the normotensive group, the serum biochemical abnormalities were more severe. Sixty percent of the normotensive casts (12/20) were azotemic (BUN>34?mg/dl) with a mean of 114±95.2; 58% (11/19) were hypercreatinemic (>2.2?mg/dl) with a mean of 8.9±7.9, and 55% (11/20) were hyperkalemic (>4.2?mEq/L) (mean 6.2±7.9). Within the hypertensive cats group, 50% (4/8) were mildly azotemic (BUN ? mean 49±24.4?mg/dl); 50% (4/8) were hypercreatinemic (mean 2.9±1.95?mg/dl), and only 1/8 was hyperkalemic (mean 3.9±0.6 mEq/L). The volume of urine in the bladder at the time of presentation did not seem to be significantly different between the 2 groups (94.7±57.1?ml in the normotensive group vs. 83.8±26.7?ml in the hypertensive group). Conclusions: The results suggest that cats with acute urethral obstruction and a normal mean arterial pressure at presentation were more likely to have severe azotemia, hypercreatinemia and hyperkalemia.
