AB  - ABSTRACT Integrins are cell surface receptors that form the link between extracellular matrix molecules of the cell environment and internal cell signalling and the cytoskeleton. They are involved in several processes, e.g. adhesion and migration during development and repair. This review focuses on the role of integrins in axonal regeneration. Integrins participate in spontaneous axonal regeneration in the peripheral nervous system through binding to various ligands that either inhibit or enhance their activation and signalling. Integrin biology is more complex in the central nervous system. Integrins receptors are transported into growing axons during development, but selective polarised transport of integrins limits the regenerative response in adult neurons. Manipulation of integrins and related molecules to control their activation state and localisation within axons is a promising route towards stimulating effective regeneration in the central nervous system.

AB  - Summary It has become increasingly obvious that factors such as communication, teamwork, and leadership have significant roles in patient safety. In healthcare, when communication breaks down patient safety is jeopardized, a reality that has been documented in a number of clinical settings, including general medicine, emergency departments, and surgery. Teamwork is the array of interconnected behaviors, cognitive processes, and attitudes that make coordinated and adaptive performance possible in complex environments such as clinical settings. This chapter provides some examples of breakdowns in communication within the context of veterinary anesthesia. Every method of communication is prone to error. Oral communications are often only partially recalled by the receiver. Written communications are time consuming so are often only partially completed. Electronic communications are often too brief. Forms should be backed up with verbal communications and vice versa. Standardizing communication and communication training should be encouraged.

AB  - Objectives: An association between heart rate (HR) and bodyweight has been reported in dogs and it is common belief that small breeds of dog exhibit higher HR than large breeds. The first aim of this study was to test the null hypothesis that, in veterinary clinical practice, bodyweight does not affect HR measured in healthy dogs. A second objective of this investigation was to assess whether other variables, such as gender, breed morphology, age and demeanour, may have a significant effect on dog?s HR measured in a clinical setting. Methods: The investigation was performed via two different studies: a retrospective analysis performed on 243 electrocardiogram recordings and a prospective study based on 153 standardised clinical examinations. Results: The two separate studies did not show any significant correlation between HR and bodyweight (P=0·5705 and P=0·4682, respectively). Subject?s breed morphology and gender did not appear to affect HR measured under these circumstances. However, dogs under the age of one year seem to have significantly higher HRs than older dogs (P < 0·05). Finally, subject?s demeanour was also found to have a significant influence on HR; lower values were recorded in relaxed dogs, and higher rates were documented in excited, nervous dogs (P < 0·05). Clinical Significance: Normal HR could be erroneously interpreted as bradycardia or tachycardia if bodyweight was to be considered a determinant factor. Instead, HR in healthy dogs undergoing routine clinical examination is related to their demeanour or age, if younger than 12 months, but does not appear to be related to bodyweight.

AB  - ABSTRACT Linear-dendron (LD) hybrids are macromolecules comprising a linear polymer or oligomer conjugated at one or both termini with branched macromolecules called dendrons. Since their introduction approximately 2 decades ago, tremendous progress has been made in their synthesis, the study of their self-assembly, and toward their application in a variety of fields. This highlight is focused on aqueous assemblies of LD hybrids where function is imparted by the dendron, linear component, or both. These functions include the encapsulation and release of drug molecules, enhancement of cell uptake and targeting of specific tissues, and the stabilization of enzymes for catalysis. In addition, many stimuli-responsive LD hybrids that undergo changes in response to light, enzymes, pH, temperature, redox potential, or even multiple stimuli have been developed. LD hybrids can also be used to form networks via cross-linking reactions. Described here are the structure?property relationships underlying the functions of these materials, along with their potential applications. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym.

AB  - Summary This chapter explores the main tasks a foundation doctor can expect to face in their surgical job, and provides practical tips and advice to guide them in becoming a proficient, confident, multi-tasking junior surgeon. All patients undergoing elective surgery will be assessed preoperatively, usually in pre-assessment clinics a few weeks prior to surgery. To reduce the risk of aspiration during anaesthesia, patients are fasted preoperatively. Obtaining consent is an art combining communication skills, surgical knowledge and perception. Further to all the checks doctor have done, further perioperative checks are done according to the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist. Thromboprophylaxis is essential in the surgical setting. One of doctor's most important roles on the wards will be management of post-operative patients. They will need a constant degree of suspicion for emerging complications, which may be directly related to surgery or indirect responses to the physiological stresses of surgery and anaesthesia.

AB  - Abstract In this study we demonstrate the feasibility of combined chlorine-35, sodium-23 and proton magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 9.4?Tesla, and present the first in vivo chlorine-35 images obtained by means of MRI. With the experimental setup used in this study all measurements could be done in one session without changing the setup or moving the subject. The multinuclear measurement requires a total measurement time of 2?h and provides morphological (protons) and physiological (sodium-23, chlorine-35) information in one scanning session. Chlorine-35, sodium-23 and high resolution proton images were acquired from a phantom, a healthy rat and from a rat displaying a focal cerebral infarction. Compared to the healthy tissue a signal enhancement of a factor of 2.2?±?0.2 in the chlorine-35 and a factor of 2.9?±?0.6 in the sodium-23 images is observed in the areas of infarction. Exemplary unlocalized measurement of the in vivo longitudinal and transversal relaxation time of chlorine-35 in a healthy rat showed multi-exponential behaviour. A biexponential fit revealed a fast and a slow relaxing component with T1,a?=?(1.7?±?0.4) ms, T1,b?=?(25.1?±?1.4) ms, amplitudes of A?=?0.26?±?0.02, (1?A)?=?0.74?±?0.02 and T2,a?=?(1.3?±?0.1) ms, T2,b?=?(11.8?±?1.1) ms, A?=?0.64?±?0.02, (1?A)?=?0.36?±?0.02. Combined proton, sodium-23 and chlorine-35 MRI may provide a new approach for non-invasive studies of ionic regulatory processes under physiological and pathological conditions in vivo.

AB  - Background and aim? Three serious transfusion-related incidents over a 9?month period highlighted the clinical risk in transfusion during 2001?2002. This lead to the development of a strategy to comprehensively review and implement transfusion safety initiatives across the Bayside health network of which the Alfred is a major hospital. Intervention The initiative commenced in January 2003 with the assembly of a multi-disciplinary team that consisted of medical, nursing, scientific as well as hospital executive representation. This was possible with the appointment of a Transfusion Nurse as part of the Victorian Department of Human Services Blood Matters Collaborative and a Transfusion Medicine Registrar, co-appointed by the hospital and Australian Red Cross Blood Service. The activities consisted initially of process mapping blood transfusion practice. Key areas were then selected for targeting process improvement, namely; ? Patient and product identification, ? Sample labelling, ? Blood component administration. Result? Initiatives implemented were; ? Widespread medical and nursing education on transfusion issues. ? Increase transfusion information availability. ? Network-wide implementation of strict criteria for specimen labelling (all specimens) in line with ANZSBT pre-transfusion testing guidelines. ? Development of a pre-transfusion testing and blood request form. ? Development of a blood administration form to reconcile all transfusion related documentation in the medical record. - Policy and guideline development. Conclusion? Sustained improvement requires ongoing dedicated personnel to maintain gains, continue to audit practice, analyse incident data both actual adverse incidents as well as near-miss events and to respond to these challenges within an ongoing and operational quality improvement framework.

AB  - Summary The family Russulaceae is considered an iconic lineage of mostly mushroom-forming basidiomycetes due to their importance as edible mushrooms in many parts of the world, and their ubiquity as ectomycorrhizal symbionts in both temperate and tropical forested biomes. Although much research has been focused on this group, a comprehensive or cohesive synthesis by which to understand the functional diversity of the group has yet to develop. Interest in ectomycorrhizal fungi, of which Russulaceae is a key lineage, is prodigious due to the important roles they play as plant root mutualists in ecosystem functioning, global carbon sequestration, and a potential role in technology development toward environmental sustainability. As one of the most species-diverse ectomycorrhizal lineages, the Russulaceae has recently been the focus of a dense sampling and genome sequencing initiative with the Joint Genome Institute aimed at untangling their functional roles and testing whether functional niche specialization exists for independent lineages of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Here we present a review of important studies on this group to contextualize what we know about its members' evolutionary history and ecosystem functions, as well as to generate hypotheses establishing the Russulaceae as a valuable experimental system.

AB  - Abstract Plant natural products derived from phenylalanine and the phenylpropanoid pathway are impressive in their chemical diversity and are the result of plant evolution, which has selected for the acquisition of large repertoires of pigments, structural and defensive compounds, all derived from a phenylpropanoid backbone via the plant-specific phenylpropanoid pathway. These compounds are important in plant growth, development and responses to environmental stresses and thus can have large impacts on agricultural productivity. While plant-based medicines containing phenylpropanoid-derived active components have long been used by humans, the benefits of specific flavonoids and other phenylpropanoid-derived compounds to human health and their potential for long-term health benefits have been only recognized more recently. In this part of the review, we discuss the diversity and biosynthetic origins of phenylpropanoids and particularly of the flavonoid and stilbenoid natural products. We then review data pertaining to the modes of action and biological properties of these compounds, referring on their effects on human health and physiology and their roles as plant defense and antimicrobial compounds. This review continues in Part II discussing the use of biotechnological tools targeting the rational reconstruction of multienzyme pathways in order to modify the production of such compounds in plants and model microbial systems for the benefit of agriculture and forestry.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To determine the plasma concentration and define the pharmacokinetic characteristics of fentanyl (10??g?kg?1) administered as a single intravenous (IV) injection followed by: (a) no further drug; or (b) a constant rate infusion (CRI) of fentanyl 10??g?kg?1?hour?1 lasting 1, 3 or 4?hours in dogs. Animals? Fourteen healthy adult beagles (seven males and seven females). Experimental design? Randomized cross-over design. Materials and methods? Dogs were randomly assigned to four treatment groups. Drugs were administered to each dog in a randomized cross-over design with at least a 14-day washout interval between experiments. All dogs received an IV loading dose of fentanyl (10??g?kg?1). One group received no further fentanyl. In others, the loading dose was followed by a CRI of fentanyl (10??g?kg?1?hour?1) for 1, 3 or 4?hours. Blood samples were collected and plasma fentanyl concentrations determined using high-performance liquid chromatography?mass spectrometry. Plasma pharmacokinetic estimates were obtained by plotting plasma concentrations versus time data and by fitting the change in concentration to a pharmacokinetic model, using a purpose-built program written by the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences (Kyoto University) in Visual Basic (VBA) on Excel (Microsoft Corporation). Results? Plasma fentanyl concentration decreased rapidly after single IV injection: the plasma concentration?time curve best fitted a two-compartment model. Pharmacokinetic variables for IV injection were characterized by a short distribution half-time (t1/2α was 4.5?minutes), a relatively long elimination half time (t1/2? was 45.7?minutes), a large volume of distribution (approximately 5?L?kg?1) and high total body clearance (77.9?mL?minute?1?kg?1). Stable plasma fentanyl levels were obtained in all CRI groups although pharmacokinetic variables were influenced by the duration of administration. Conclusions and clinical relevance? While this study clarified the pharmacokinetic features of rapid IV fentanyl injection and CRI in dogs, the plasma concentration achieving analgesia was not and so further research is needed. Further studies on the effects of other sedatives and/or anaesthetics on fentanyl's disposition are also required as the drug is commonly used with other agents.

AB  - How many underlying characteristics (or factors) does a set of survey questions measure? When subjects answer a set of self-report questions, is it more appropriate to analyze the questions individually, to pool responses to all of the questions to form one global score, or to combine subsets of related questions to define multiple underlying factors? Factor analysis is the statistical method of choice for answering such questions. When researchers have no idea beforehand about what factors may underlie a set of questions, they use exploratory factor analysis to infer the best explanatory model from observed data ?after the fact.? If, on the other hand, researchers have a hypothesis beforehand about the underlying factors, then they can use confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to evaluate how well this model explains the observed data and to compare the model's goodness-of-fit with that of other competing models. This article describes the basic rules and building blocks of CFA: what it is, how it works, and how researchers can use it. The authors begin by placing CFA in the context of a common research application?namely, assessing quality of medical outcome using a patient satisfaction survey. They then explain, within this research context, how CFA is used to evaluate the explanatory power of a factor model and to decide which model or models best represent the data. The information that must be specified in the analysis to estimate a CFA model is highlighted, and the statistical assumptions and limitations of this analysis are noted. Analyzing the responses of 1,614 emergency medical patients to a commonly-used ?patient satisfaction? questionnaire, the authors demonstrate how to: 1) compare competing factor-models to find the best-fitting model; 2) modify models to improve their goodness-of-fit; 3) test hypotheses about relationships among the underlying factors; 4) examine mean differences in ?factor scores?; and 5) refine an existing instrument into a more streamlined form that has fewer questions and better conceptual and statistical precision than the original instrument. Finally, the role of CFA in developing new instruments is discussed.

AB  - Aim? To evaluate the Baxter ?Blood in Motion? temperature controlled system for transportation of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) by the blood bank at St Vincent?s Hospital Melbourne. The trial incorporates transport of RBCs between the blood bank and theatre within St Vincent?s, and between St Vincent?s blood bank and blood banks within peripheral laboratories. Interest in this system arose in response to the Australian Red Cross Blood Service (ARCBS) proposed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and ARCBS amendments to packing of RBCs for transport effective 1st January 2004. According to the MOU, RBCs must be transported in a system which maintains a temperature range of 2?10 degrees Celcius. Method? RBCs were transported between the blood bank and theatre in the ?Blood in Motion? transport elements on 11 occasions [N(t)?=?11]. RBCs were transported between St Vincent?s blood bank and Werribee Mercy Hospital blood bank in the ?Blood in Motion? transport elements contained within a ?Blood in Motion? silver bag on 6 occasions [N(w)?=?6]. An acceptable outcome resulted if the temperature displayed on the LCD thermometer inside the system was within range of 2?10 degrees Celcius on arrival at destination. Result? An acceptable outcome was achieved in 100% of transport episodes to date. Further data will be collected and evaluated. Conclusion? The Baxter ?Blood in Motion? transport system is a viable alternative to the ARCBS packing system for transport of RBCs (and facilitates compliance with the proposed ARCBS MOU). This system would ensure maintenance of RBC quality and safety during transport by St Vincent?s blood bank and minimise wastage of RBCs.

AB  - Objective To verify the ability of a novel Canine Elbow Realignment Osteotomy (CERO) system for acute axial radial or ulnar lengthening to restore normal elbow congruency in a shortened radius cadaver model using assessment by computed tomography (CT). Study Design In vitro cadaver study. Animals Five pairs of greyhound forelimbs from animals euthanatized for reasons unrelated to the study. Methods CT of each elbow was performed (1) pre-operatively (pre-op), (2) after placement of a linear motor IMEX? external skeletal fixator (ESF) on the radius with diaphyseal ostectomy and radial shorting of 1?5 mm (post-ESF), and (3) after CERO surgery to lengthen the radius proximal to the ostectomy site by an amount equal to the degree of radial shortening (post-CERO). The joint space at 7 loci on dorsal plane and 6 loci on sagittal plane reconstructions was measured to assess changes in joint congruity between pre-op, post-ESF, and post-CERO. Repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc comparisons were performed to compare measurements between the 3 groups. Results Mean joint space measurements at most loci in the dorsal and sagittal planes were significantly different post-ESF compared with pre-op, confirming development of joint incongruency with the model. Post-CERO joint space measurements did not differ significantly compared with pre-op measurements, demonstrating the return to normal joint congruency using the CERO procedure. Conclusion CERO surgery restored humeroradioulnar congruency in our cadaver model and may have application for acute correction of axial radial or ulnar incongruency in canine elbows secondary to elbow dysplasia or premature growth plate closure.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Sacroiliac joint injuries can cause poor performance; however, the interaction between pelvic mechanics and the sacroiliac joint is poorly understood. Objective: To measure pelvic displacement during 3D sacroiliac joint loading. Methods: Nine reflective triads were attached rigidly to bony prominences in sacropelvic specimens harvested from 14 horses for stereophotogrammetric analysis of triad displacements and joint kinematics. The sacrum was coupled to a load cell and mounted vertically within a material testing system (MTS). A pneumatic actuator was used to apply 90 Nm moments to the ischial arch to simulate nutation-counternutation and left and right lateral bending of the sacroiliac joints. Axial rotation of the sacrum was induced by torsion of the upper MTS fixture. Vectors of marker displacement within orthogonal planes of motion were measured during loading of the sacropelvic specimens. Comparisons in the magnitude and direction of triad displacements were made between paired left-right markers and paired loading conditions. Results: Nutation-counternutation of the sacroiliac joint caused vertical displacement of the ischial tuberosities and cranial-caudal displacement of the wings of the ilium. Lateral bending induced rotational displacement within the horizontal plane of all pelvic landmarks, relative to the sacrum. Axial rotation of the sacrum caused elevation of the wing of the ilium ipsilateral to the direction of sacral rotation and depression of the contralateral ilial wing. Significant paired left-right differences occurred during most sacroiliac joint loading conditions. Comparable magnitudes of pelvic displacement were measured during nutation-counternutation, left and right lateral bending, and left and right axial rotation. Conclusions: The equine pelvis is not a rigid structure and asymmetric pelvic deformation occurs during most sacroiliac joint movements. Clinical relevance: Bony pelvic deformation should be considered a normal response to any sacroiliac joint movement.

AB  - ABSTRACT The evidence that Robert Gallo and his colleagues presented on 4th May 1984 regarding HTLV-III (HIV) isolation and the role of HIV in the pathogenesis of AIDS is critically analysed. It is concluded that the evidence does not constitute proof of the isolation of a retrovirus, that the virus is exogenous, or that the virus is causally related to AIDS.

AB  - A 29-year-old man from east texas presented with a 3-month history of a large, isolated, painful subcutaneous nodule on his lower right leg. An excisional biopsy showed zones of necrosis in the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous adipose tissue with a neutrophilic infiltrate. The dermis showed a mixed infiltrate with necrotic debris and a non-gravid adult female filarial nematode with a thick, multi-layered cuticle, paired uteri, and an intestine. The histologic features were diagnostic for dirofilaria tenuis, the raccoon heartworm. Dirofilaria tenuis causes heartworm infection in raccoons and infrequently causes human disease. When humans do contract dirofilariasis, the mode of transmission is via a bite from a mosquito infected with dirofilaria larvae. Humans are a dead end host and dirofilaria cannot reproduce in humans, but they do cause various lesions at the site of the mosquito bites. We report a very rare case of human dirofilaria tenuis infection manifesting as a subcutaneous nodule. Dirofilaria tenuis infections are very rare in the U.S., and usually occur in the Southeastern U.S.

AB  - Aim: Multi-center's clinical study for the application of the cultured dermal substitute (CDS) composed of hyaluronic acid and collagen spongy matrix with allogenic cultured fibroblasts1 is in progress since 2001. In this study, effect of the CDS for the treatment of fresh DDB wounds was tested. Methods: Six cases of second-degree burns, diagnosed as DDB by observation of blood stream of the dermal capillary using Compact Micro Vision System (Hi-Scope?, Hi Rox Co., Japan), were treated with the cultured allogenic fibroblasts, CDS. Results: The epithelialization of the wounds was obtained on 8.2?±?2.6 (mean?±?SD) days after the application. Conclusion: The results of our clinical experiences suggest that the allogenic cultured fibroblasts have beneficial effect on the wound healing of the DDB.

AB  - Abstract This study utilises multi-isotopic analysis to reconstruct diet and source-water consumption from human remains collected at Carrizales, in the Zaña Valley of northern coastal Peru. Carrizales is a multicomponent site that encompasses the remains of (a) Early Intermediate Period (200?800 CE) cemeteries (Conjuntos 126 and 127), (b) Late Sicán/Lambayeque period (ca. 1100?1350 CE) domestic occupations (Conjuntos 125, 128, and 131), and (c) a planned town (reducción) into which indigenous people were resettled under Spanish rule, ca. 1572 CE (Conjunto 123). Faunal and botanical assemblages at the site differ significantly between the Late Sicán/Lambayeque and early colonial phases, suggesting a distinct shift in local subsistence regimes following Spanish colonisation and resettlement. Human remains were collected from Carrizales for the characterisation of dietary isotopes and further examination of the impacts of Spanish colonialism on native foodways. Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotope values were characterised in the enamel carbonate, bone carbonate, and bone collagen of individuals associated with Early Intermediate Period contexts (N = 4) and the late 16th century chapel within the site's reducción (N = 21). Over half of the study sample failed to produce viable bone collagen, an issue that is common in bioarchaeological samples from the north coast of Peru. However, among those with viable bone collagen and carbonate, there were minimal differences in δ13C, δ18O, and δ15N values between the two phases. This extends to values in enamel carbonate, which is highly resistant to diagenesis. Therefore, patterns in isotope values do not mirror the significant differences manifest in food remains from Carrizales. We suggest that (a) the diets of Early Intermediate Period individuals and Early Colonial period individuals buried at the site were quite similar, contrasting with the patterns indicated by Late Intermediate Period food remains, and (b) both populations obtained water from similar sources?a pattern that reinforces the characterisation of reducción in the Zaña Valley as a relatively local phenomenon in which nearby populations were concentrated into planned towns, rather than drawn from distant valleys.
