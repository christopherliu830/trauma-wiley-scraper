AB  - Abstract Objectives To compare the anaesthetic, analgesic and cardiorespiratory effects of intramuscular (IM) medetomidine and ketamine administered alone or combined with morphine or tramadol, for orchiectomy in cats. Study design Randomised, blinded, prospective clinical study. Animals Thirty client-owned cats. Materials and methods Cats (n = 10 in each group) received a combination of medetomidine (60 ?gkg?1) and ketamine (10 mg kg?1) alone (MedK); combined with morphine (0.2 mg kg?1) (MedKM), or combined with tramadol (2 mg kg?1) (MedKT) IM. Time of induction, surgical and recovery events were recorded, and physiological parameters measured and recorded. Analgesia was evaluated with a visual analogue scale, a composite scoring system and the von Frey mechanical threshold device, every hour from three to eight hours post-drug administration injection. Data were analyzed with a linear mixed model, Kruskal?Wallis or Chi-square tests (p < 0.05). Results Median (IQR) induction and recovery times (minutes) were not significantly (p = 0.125) different between groups: 5.6 (2.7?8.0), 7.4 (5.1?9.6) and 8.0 (5.8?14.9) for induction and 128.5 (95.1?142.8), 166.4 (123.1?210.0) and 142.9 (123.4?180.2) for recovery, with MedK, MedKT and MedKM, respectively. Two cats (MedKM) required alfaxalone for endotracheal intubation. In all groups, three or four cats required additional isoflurane for surgery. Arterial oxygen tension overall (mean ± SD: 66 ± 2 mmHg) was low. Surgery resulted in increased systolic arterial blood pressure (p < 0.001), haemoglobin saturation (p < 0.001), respiratory (p = 0.003) and heart rates (p = 0.002). Pain scores did not differ significantly between groups. Von Frey responses decreased over time; changes over time varied by treatment (p < 0.001), MedK returning to baseline values more rapidly than MedKM and MedKT. No cat required rescue analgesics. Conclusion and clinical relevance All three protocols can provide adequate anaesthesia and analgesia for orchiectomy in cats. However, rescue intervention to maintain surgical anaesthesia may be required in some cats. Oxygen supplementation is advised.

AB  - Abstract This study utilises multi-isotopic analysis to reconstruct diet and source-water consumption from human remains collected at Carrizales, in the Zaña Valley of northern coastal Peru. Carrizales is a multicomponent site that encompasses the remains of (a) Early Intermediate Period (200?800 CE) cemeteries (Conjuntos 126 and 127), (b) Late Sicán/Lambayeque period (ca. 1100?1350 CE) domestic occupations (Conjuntos 125, 128, and 131), and (c) a planned town (reducción) into which indigenous people were resettled under Spanish rule, ca. 1572 CE (Conjunto 123). Faunal and botanical assemblages at the site differ significantly between the Late Sicán/Lambayeque and early colonial phases, suggesting a distinct shift in local subsistence regimes following Spanish colonisation and resettlement. Human remains were collected from Carrizales for the characterisation of dietary isotopes and further examination of the impacts of Spanish colonialism on native foodways. Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotope values were characterised in the enamel carbonate, bone carbonate, and bone collagen of individuals associated with Early Intermediate Period contexts (N = 4) and the late 16th century chapel within the site's reducción (N = 21). Over half of the study sample failed to produce viable bone collagen, an issue that is common in bioarchaeological samples from the north coast of Peru. However, among those with viable bone collagen and carbonate, there were minimal differences in δ13C, δ18O, and δ15N values between the two phases. This extends to values in enamel carbonate, which is highly resistant to diagenesis. Therefore, patterns in isotope values do not mirror the significant differences manifest in food remains from Carrizales. We suggest that (a) the diets of Early Intermediate Period individuals and Early Colonial period individuals buried at the site were quite similar, contrasting with the patterns indicated by Late Intermediate Period food remains, and (b) both populations obtained water from similar sources?a pattern that reinforces the characterisation of reducción in the Zaña Valley as a relatively local phenomenon in which nearby populations were concentrated into planned towns, rather than drawn from distant valleys.

AB  - Smith?Lemli?Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is an autosomal recessive, multiple malformation syndrome with neurocognitive impairment. SLOS arises from mutations in the 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase gene which results in impaired enzymatic conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol. In the current work, we sought to measure proteins that were altered in the cerebrospinal fluid from SLOS patients compared to pediatric controls. Using a multi-analyte antibody-based assay, we found that 12 proteins are altered in SLOS patients. Validation studies were carried out and the findings from this study suggest alterations in extracellular matrix remodeling and further evidence of oxidative stress within the disease pathophysiology. The results of this study will be used to explore biological pathways altered in SLOS and identifies a set of CSF proteins that can be evaluated as biomarkers in future therapeutic trials. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective We analyze the processing sequence involved in the manufacture of a skull-cup and the manipulation of human bones from the Early Neolithic of Cueva de El Toro (Málaga, Spain). Materials and methods The Early Neolithic material studied includes human remains found in two separate assemblages. Assemblage A consists of one skull-cup, a non-manipulated adult human mandible, and four ceramic vessels. Assemblage B contains manipulated and non-manipulated human remains that appeared mingled with domestic waste. Using a taphonomic approach, we evaluate the skull-cup processing and the anthropogenic alteration of human bones. Results The skull-cup was processed by careful paring away of skin, fragmentation of the facial skeleton and base of the skull, and controlled percussion of the edges of the calotte to achieve a regular shape. It was later boiled for some time in a container that caused pot polish in a specific area. The other human bones appeared scattered throughout the living area, mixed with other remains of domestic activity. Some of these bones show cut marks, percussion damage for marrow extraction, and tooth/chewing marks. Discussion Evidence from Cueva de El Toro suggests that cannibalism was conducted in the domestic sphere, likely following ritualized practices where the skull-cup could have played a part. Interpretation of this evidence suggests two hypotheses: (a) aggressive cannibalism relates to extreme inter-group violence; and (b) funerary cannibalism is a facet of multi-stage burial practices. Similar evidence has been found in other Neolithic sites of this region and suggests that cannibalism and skull-cups were elements widespread in these communities. These practices may be linked to significant transformations associated with the end of the Early Neolithic in southern Iberia.

AB  - Abstract Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a disabling pain condition with sensory, motor and autonomic manifestations. Uncertainty remains about how CRPS can be effectively managed. We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for treatment and prophylactic interventions for CRPS published during the period 2000?2012, building on previous work by another group reviewing the period 1966?2000. Bibliographic database searches identified 173 papers which were filtered by three reviewers. This process generated 29 trials suitable for further analysis, each of which was reviewed and scored by two independent reviewers for methodological quality using a 15-item checklist. A number of novel and potentially effective treatments were investigated. Analysing the results from both review periods in combination, there was a steep rise in the number of published RCTs per review decade. There is evidence for the efficacy of 10 treatments (3? strong ? bisphosphonates, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and graded motor imagery, 1? moderate and 6? limited evidence), and against the efficacy of 15 treatments (1? strong, 1? moderate and ?13 limited). The heterogeneity of trialled interventions and the pilot nature of many trials militate against drawing clear conclusions about the clinical usefulness of most interventions. This and the observed phenomenon of excellent responses in CRPS subgroups would support the case for a network- and multi-centre approach in the conduct of future clinical trials. Most published trials in CRPS are small with a short follow-up period, although several novel interventions investigated from 2000 to 2012 appear promising.

AB  - Eur J Clin Invest 2012 Abstract Background? This study tested the hypothesis that surgical stress and the host response to this trauma trigger an inflammatory cascade in which the neutrophil plays a central role. We hypothesised that pre-operative neutrophil migratory responses will correlate with post-operative clinical outcome in our shock model of open-heart surgery patients. We also tested the hypothesis that surface expression of adhesion molecules involved in the migratory process ? CD11b, CD47 and CD99 ? could be used to predict outcome. We believe that combining neutrophil migratory response, CD11b, CD47 and CD99 with the logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) will strengthen the power of the EuroSCORE not only in predicting post-operative mortality but also other clinical endpoints. Materials and methods? Neutrophils were isolated pre-operatively from n?=?31 patients undergoing open-heart surgery and allowed to migrate across endothelial monolayers in response to N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine (fMLP). Isolated neutrophils were also assessed for surface expression of CD11b, CD47 and CD99 in response to fMLP by flow cytometry. Post-operative clinical parameters collected included days 1?5 white cell count and creatinine levels as well as intensive care unit (ICU) and post-operative hospital stay. Results? Pre-operative surface expression of CD99 and CD47 correlates with post-operative creatinine levels (P?<?0·05), a measurement of renal injury. We also show that while the logistic EuroSCORE alone can be used as a predictor of ICU stay, when combined with pre-operative CD99 surface expression, it improves its AUC value (0·794). Conclusion? Immunological markers, specifically the ability of the neutrophil to migrate, combined with the logistic EuroSCORE lead to improved sensitivity and specificity to predict patient outcome.

AB  - Abstract This Minireview focuses on recent advances in the applications of microelectrodes to detect and monitor targeted analytes in bioelectrochemical processes. Notably, these processes are electrochemically driven reactions that involve the detection of targets from the biological realm. Wide-ranging applications of electrochemical sensors have been reported in the last few decades in various research fields, owing to favorable attributes such as high selectivity and sensitivity, rapid analysis, simplicity, easy fabrication, and cost effectiveness. Accordingly, in this Minireview, we explore recent advances in bioelectrochemistry based on small detection probes or structures modified for a variety of analytes, exploiting multi-approach advantages of enhanced electrochemical detection surface or targeted analyte pursuit. The target analytes included in this Minireview are neurotransmitters and disease biomarkers detected using enzymatic and non-enzymatic electrode modifications.

AB  - Abstract Pain and speed of convalescence are the two main problems after uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We therefore identified interventional and descriptive studies in electronic databases and supplemented them with manual searches. Pain and interventional analgesic studies were analysed with reference to the effects on specific pain components after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Convalescence and factors associated with early recovery were also analysed. Pain after cholecystectomy is most intense for the first 2?3 days with a high interindividual variability and dominated by incisional pain rather than other pain components. Early pain after cholecystectomy is reduced by minimising residual pneumoperitoneum and by giving incisional local anaesthetics, epidural analgesia, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. There are inconclusive data about type and pressure of pneumoperitoneum, the use of intraperitoneal local anaesthetics, and the type of general anaesthesia. Pain and medico-cultural traditions are the main factors responsible for prolonged convalescence after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. To minimise pain and the duration of convalescence, we recommend multi-modal analgesic treatment in combination with short, standardised instructions to resume work and normal activity.

AB  - Summary This chapter outlines the fundamental skills and knowledge necessary to work in the emergency and unscheduled care setting for treating infectious diseases, and sepsis. It then highlights key history/assessment knowledge, identifying red-flags, and defining and assisting with making a diagnosis. The chapter also explores these ailments, with core information on definition, aetiology, epidemiology, history, examination, investigations and management. Malaria is one of the most common causes of fever and illnesses in the tropics. History of malaria includes foreign travel to endemic area, fever, and flu-like symptoms. Sepsis causes a number of abnormal physiological processes. ABCDE assessment and interventions are preferred for sepsis treatment. Septic arthritis can be seen at any age, including in babies and infants, although it is less common in older children, teenagers and young adults. Typhoid fever is a symptomatic bacterial infection that can spread throughout the body. IV antibiotics are considered for this kind of infections.

AB  - The large bulk of lost craniofacial soft tissue is mainly adipose tissue. Current surgical approaches following tumor resection and trauma have limitations. Adipose derived-stromal cells (ADSCs), also named as preadipocytes, have been demonstrated to be a good cell candidate for adipose tissue engineering. However, characteristics of scaffold played important role in a successful tissue engineered adipose tissue. Objectives:? The present study is to investigate whether in vitro adipogenesis could be induced both in a monolayer and 3-D by ADSCs. Methods:? Healthy adult ADSCs were isolated by liposuction from fat pads. After discarding the unattached cells, the ADSCs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics until they reached confluence. After trypsinization, ADSCs were subcultured at a density of 105 cells/100?mm-dish as a first passage. The monolayer and 3-D adipogenesis were assessed after seeding 105 ADSCs into each well of 6-well plates and 5???106 ADSCs/ml into biodegradable collagen sponges, respectively, followed by replacement of basic medium with adipogenic one. Results:? In both monolayer and 3-D scaffolds, lipids containing adipocytes were observed 1 week after adipogenic stimulation, and further increased over the time. By contrast, no adipogenesis was observed in ADSCs cultured in basic medium. Conclusions:? Human adipose-derived stromal cells isolated from fat pads can readily be induced toward adipogenesis in vitro. The in vivo adipogenesis potential of ADSCs is being investigated.

AB  - Abstract A high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS) method was applied to the characterization of ten iridoid glycosides in Gardenia jasminoides Ellis, a traditional Chinese medicine. During the process of structural elucidation, two groups of isomers including two epimers were structurally characterized and differentiated according to their distinctive fragmentation patterns which were closely related to their isomeric differentiations. Subsequently, the major compounds were purified by multi-dimensional chromatography and semi-preparative HPLC and the structure identification was confirmed with NMR techniques. The major fragmentation pathways of iridoid glycosides in Gardenia jasminoides Ellis obtained through the MS data were schemed systematically, which provided the best sensitivity and specificity for characterization of the iridoid glycosides especially the isomers so far. Based on the fragmentation patterns of iridoid glycosides concluded, seven major iridoid glycosides were characterized in rat plasma after intravenous administration of Gardenia jasminoides Ellis.

AB  - Abstract We started performing laparoscopic cholecystectomies in 1991. Since that time, many surgeons have been trained in laparoscopic and minimally invasive surgery, and laparoscopic surgery has been used in numerous procedures, with patients benefitting as a result. We performed the first automated surgery in Korea using Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning in June 1996. Inspired by Inbae Yoon and assisted by his generous donation, our hospital started the IB Yoon Multi-Specialty Endoscopic Research & Training Center in 1998. Subsequently in March 2005, we started the Severance Robotic and Minimally Invasive Surgery Center. The establishment of these centers has enabled us to widen the use of laparoscopic surgery and to teach many surgeons the principles of and the techniques involved in laparoscopic and robotic surgery. We performed our first robotic surgery using the da Vinci Surgical System in July 2005. In the 4 years since introducing the da Vinci Surgical System, we have successfully performed more than 2600 robotic surgical procedures. As the collaboration between medicine and robotic engineering produces more technically advanced results, we hopefully can develop our own version of the robotic system in the near future.

AB  - Abstract Cardiac surgery strategies include surgeries performed on the beating heart, surgeries performed with brief circulatory arrest during venous inflow occlusion, surgeries performed with the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and hybrid cardiac surgeries that combine image-guided interventional techniques with minimal-incision cardiac approaches. Many cardiac surgeries can be performed on a beating heart without circulatory or cardiac arrest. Venous inflow occlusion is a strategy that provides a brief period of circulatory arrest, allowing for open cardiac repairs that can be performed in a short period of time, generally less than 2 minutes. CPB is a strategy where the patient is connected to an extracorporeal system that provides flow of oxygenated blood to the patient allowing the heart to be stopped for surgical repair. Hybrid cardiac surgery is an emerging option for correction of congenital and acquired structural cardiac defects.

Twenty client-owned dogs undergoing total ear canal ablation. Methods? Dogs were randomly assigned to the lidocaine group (LID) or the morphine group (MOR). The LID group received a constant rate infusion of lidocaine locally and a continuous IV infusion of saline, while the MOR group received a constant rate infusion of saline locally and a continuous IV infusion of morphine. The primary investigator evaluated each patient and determined a hospital behavior score, anesthesia recovery score, preoperative pain score, and serial postoperative pain and sedation scores over 38?hours. Pain and sedation observations were videotaped and scored by three additional evaluators. Evaluators were blinded to treatment assignments. Results? There were no significant differences in age, weight, hospital behavior scores or anesthesia recovery scores. The primary investigator's pain scores were not significantly different, but sedation scores were significantly lower for the LID group. Sedation and pain scores by the video evaluators were not significantly different between groups. Kappa agreement between observers was poor, but better agreement was noted between sedation scores than pain scores. Drug-related complications were significantly lower in the LID group (n?=?0) compared with the MOR group (n?=?5). Wound complications were not significantly different (LID?=?4, MOR?=?4). Intravenous delivery complications occurred in 12 (60%) patients. Local delivery complications occurred in five (25%) dogs. Delivery complications were not significantly different between groups. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Continuous incisional lidocaine delivery was an equipotent and viable method of providing postoperative analgesia compared with IV morphine. Lidocaine delivery resulted in a trend toward lower pain scores, significantly lower sedation scores, and no dogs requiring analgesic rescue. Wound complications secondary to local infusion were minor and self-limiting. Drug-related complications occurred only in the MOR group.

AB  - Topical prophylaxis against wound infection by an agent that is active against multi-resistant bacteria does not generate resistance and is rapidly cidal would be of great clinical benefit. Peptides of the innate immune system have long been known to protect a wide range of organisms from attack by bacterial and fungal pathogens. Helix BioMedix Inc. has developed a short bioactive peptide antimicrobial modeled after these peptides. HB-50 is an amphipathic cationic alpha-helical peptide that has broad spectrum activity and is rapidly microbicidal. These attributes make HB-50 an ideal candidate for wound infection prophylaxis. In vitro studies have demonstrated HB-50 to be active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria killing 5?7 log orders of bacteria within minutes. In addition, this peptide has potent activity against Vancomycin and Mupirocin resistant S. aureus. Preliminary testing of the peptide in a rat abraded skin infection model has shown the peptide?s effectiveness in preventing wound infection while not inhibiting wound healing. Additionally, the HB-50 sequence has been specifically developed to be cost effective to manufacture and therefore is well suited for use as a topical antimicrobial agent.

AB  - Summary Many athletes with an impairment are physiologically similar to able-bodied athletes, such as those with visual impairments, intellectual impairment, high-functioning CP, and forearm amputees/congenital malformations, and therefore sports nutrition principles can be directly applied to them, albeit with some practical modifications. This chapter focuses on athletes with spinal cord injury (SCI), moderate to high dysfunction cerebral palsy (CP), and lower limb/multi-limb amputees. The assessment of body composition in athletes with an impairment can be complicated and there are minimal comparative data to draw upon. The chapter talks about the micronutrients and dietary supplements such as vitamins and trace minerals such as vitamin D, nutritional ergogenic aids and creatine. Adapting sports nutrition recommendations to this population requires an intimate understanding of the individual, the sport they participate in and its physiological demands, and the practical limitations the individual may face.

AB  - Summary Neuro-oncology covers both the scientific and clinical aspects of central nervous system (CNS) tumours and neurological complications of cancer. Improvements in radiological and histological diagnosis and surgical technique, advances in molecular neuro-oncology, the application of new biological agents and increasing use of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy for tumours such as gliomas have led to small but definite improvements in survival. This chapter provides a clinically dominated guide to the key issues in neuro-oncology. It reflects the highly specialised nature of disciplines within neuro-oncology. The chapter outlines the multi-disciplinary aspects of care on clinical management. Brain tumours include primary tumours arising from intracranial structures and metastases from outside the CNS. There are a number of other rarer tumours in childhood that often present with seizures and behave in a benign fashion. They are usually treated with surgery alone.
