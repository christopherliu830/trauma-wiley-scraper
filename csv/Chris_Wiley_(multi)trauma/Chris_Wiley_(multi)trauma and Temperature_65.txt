AB  - Summary Circulatory and respiratory effects of five h of constant 1.06 per cent alveolar halothane in oxygen were identified in eight healthy horses, which breathed spontaneously, were otherwise unmedicated and positioned in sternal recumbency. Only a few important significant (P<0.05) changes occurred with time. Total peripheral resistance was about 15 per cent lower after two hours of constant dose halothane than after 30 mins of constant dose (P<0.05) and accounted for the significant 10 per cent reduction in mean carotid arterial blood pressure. By 5 h, the reduction in resistance and arterial blood pressure was 20 and 25 per cent respectively. Heart rate increased progressively with time and the increase became significant at 5 h (15 per cent increase). However, the heart rate change was not large enough to alter cardiac output. There were no major time-related changes in PaO2 or PaCO2. Three of four horses recovered from anaesthesia had markedly elevated serum creatine kinase levels and clinical signs of severe post anaesthetic myopathy.

AB  - A multi-target method that can detect a broad range of drugs in human hair, such as hypnotics, anxiolytics, analgesics, benzodiazepines, antihistamines, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants, was developed based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography?tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The drugs were extracted from 10?mg of washed hair by incubation for 18?h in a 25:25:50 (v/v/v) mixture of methanol/acetonitrile/2?mM ammonium formate (8% acetonitrile, pH?5.3). For 51% of the basic drugs, the lower limits of quantification (LLOQs) were in the range of 0.05?0.5?pg/mg, and the majority (98%) were?≤?5?pg/mg. Linearity ranged from LLOQs to 100?500?pg/mg for all the basic drugs. For acid and neutral drugs, the LLOQs ranged from 0.4 to 500?pg/mg, and linearity ranged from LLOQs to 80?40 000?pg/mg. According to published reports on concentrations attained in single dose control studies, the present method is sensitive enough to detect single-dose drug exposure for many of the drugs. The accuracy was within 75?125% for the majority of drugs. Good precision was observed (relative standard deviations [RSD%]?<?25%) for most of the compounds, including the prepared quality control (QC) hair samples. The method was applied to forensic cases and concentrations of rarely reported drugs in hair in 25 post-mortem forensic cases were presented. Hair concentrations of amisulpride, gabapentin, mianserin, mepyramine, orphenadrine, and xylometazoline have not been previously reported. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare the analgesic efficacy of bupivacaine, bupivacaine + morphine, or bupivacaine + dexmedetomidine administered epidurally in dogs undergoing pelvic limb orthopedic surgery. Study design Prospective, randomized, double blinded clinical trial. Animals Sixty dogs weighing (mean ± SD) 35 ± 15.7 kg, aged 5 ± 3 years. Methods Dogs were assigned to receive a lumbosacral epidural containing bupivacaine (B) 0.5%, 1 mg kg?1; B, bupivacaine 0.5%, 1 mg kg?1 + morphine 1%, 0.1 mg kg?1; B + M, or bupivacaine 0.5%, 1 mg kg?1 + dexmedetomidine 0.05%, 4 ?g kg?1; B + D. The anesthetic protocol was standardized. The median expired isoflurane concentration (E?Iso) and requirement for additional induction agent preventing purposeful movement were recorded. Pain was scored using visual analog (VAS) and modified University of Melbourne (UMPS) pain scales. Sedation was assessed using a 0?4 scale. All parameters were recorded preoperatively, and at extubation (t = 0), then at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20?24 hours. Hydromorphone was administered postoperatively to patients with a VAS ≥ 35 and/or UMPS ≥ 9. Time to first voluntary urination and first motor activity were recorded. Results Postoperatively, B + D had a lower UMPS pain score than B at t = 1 hour (p = 0.013), but not compared to B + M. The B + D group had a shorter time to urination (p = 0.0131) and a longer time for return of motor function (p = 0.0068). There were no other differences between the treatments. Conclusion and clinical relevance Epidurally administered B, B + M, or B + D in dogs all provided acceptable analgesia to manage post-operative orthopedic pelvic limb pain. Epidural administration of B + D is an effective alternative to the analgesia provided by B or B + M, but is associated with increased time to return of motor function. The direct neurotoxic effects of epidural dexmedetomidine have not been fully tested.

AB  - Abstract Objectives? Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted much attention by researchers worldwide in recent years for their small dimensions and unique architecture, and for having immense potential in nanomedicine as biocompatible and supportive substrates, as a novel tool for the delivery of therapeutic molecules including peptides, RNA and DNA, and also as sensors, actuators and composites. Key findings? CNTs have been employed in the development of molecular electronic, composite materials and others due to their unique atomic structure, high surface area-to-volume ratio and excellent electronic, mechanical and thermal properties. Recently they have been exploited as novel nanocarriers in drug delivery systems and biomedical applications. Their larger inner volume as compared with the dimensions of the tube and easy immobilization of their outer surface with biocompatible materials make CNTs a superior nanomaterial for drug delivery. Literature reveals that CNTs are versatile carriers for controlled and targeted drug delivery, especially for cancer cells, because of their cell membrane penetrability. Summary? This review enlightens the biomedical application of CNTs with special emphasis on utilization in controlled and targeted drug delivery, as a diagnostics tool and other possible uses in therapeutic systems. The review also focuses on the toxicity aspects of CNTs, and revealed that genotoxic potential, mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of different types of CNTs must be explored and overcome by formulating safe biomaterial for drug delivery. The review also describes the regulatory aspects and clinical and market status of CNTs.

AB  - Summary Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a leading nosocomial pathogen, infecting a wide range of anatomic sites including the respiratory tract and the bloodstream. In addition to being multi-drug resistant, little is known about the molecular basis of A. baumannii pathogenesis. To better understand A. baumannii virulence, a combination of a transposon-sequencing (TraDIS) screen and the neutropenic mouse model of bacteremia was used to identify the full set of fitness genes required during bloodstream infection. The lytic transglycosylase MltB was identified as a critical fitness factor. MltB cleaves the MurNAc-GlcNAc bond of peptidoglycan, which leads to cell wall remodeling. Here we show that MltB is part of a complex network connecting resistance to stresses, membrane homeostasis, biogenesis of pili and in vivo fitness. Indeed, inactivation of mltB not only impaired resistance to serum complement, cationic antimicrobial peptides and oxygen species, but also altered the cell envelope integrity, activated the envelope stress response, drastically reduced the number of pili at the cell surface and finally, significantly decreased colonization of both the bloodstream and the respiratory tract.

AB  - Abstract Designing amorphous systems is challenging because of the broad scope of the task. The design team must integrate various solution elements, such as hardware, software, service, and infrastructure, while resolving the communication challenges among different domain-experts. This research begins with the observation that, at the onset of an amorphous system-oriented project, design teams struggle because they are limited to knowledge of fewer than 4 of the 6 W's (Who, What, Where, When, Why, How); rather than having detailed functional or structural specifications as is the case with hardware or software products. The proposed scenario-based approaches enable design teams to effectively deal with ambiguity and to communicate their ideas among team members and managers, as well as with customers through a common language. Based on the Scenario-based Design for Amorphous Systems, methods such as the Scenario Graph and the Scenario Menu help design teams through the exploration stage of a new system development. A case-study from industry demonstrates how a multi-disciplinary design team extracted high-level functions and requirements from scenarios dealing with an open-ended project theme. The integrated framework of Scenario-based Design for Amorphous Systems guides the design teams in visualizing and organizing scenarios and making decisions in order to define an amorphous system.

AB  - Objective?To investigate the acute effects of functional magnetic stimulation (FMS) on detrusor hyper-reflexia using a multi-pulse magnetic stimulator. Patients and methods?Seven male patients with established and intractable detrusor hyper-reflexia following spinal cord injury were studied. No patient was on medication and none had had previous surgery for detrusor hyper-reflexia. After optimization of magnetic stimulation of S2?S4 sacral anterior roots by recording toe flexor electromyograms, unstable detrusor activity was provoked during cystometry by rapid infusion of fluid into the bladder. The provocation test produced consistent and predictable detrusor hyper-reflexia. On some provocations, supramaximal FMS at 20 pulses/s for 5?s was applied at detrusor pressures which were >15?cmH20. Results?Following FMS there was an obvious acute suppression of detrusor hyper-reflexia. There was a profound reduction in detrusor contraction, as assessed by the area under the curves of detrusor pressure with time. Conclusions?Functional magnetic stimulation applied over the sacrum can profoundly suppress detrusor hyper-reflexia in man. It may provide a non-invasive method of assessing patients for implantable electrical neuromodulation devices and as a therapeutic option in its own right.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the feasibility of CT pulmonary angiography for identification of naturally occurring pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs using predefined diagnostic criteria and to assess the ability of echocardiography, cardiac troponins, D-dimers and kaolin-activated thromboelastography to predict the presence of pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs. Methods Twelve dogs with immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia and evidence of respiratory distress were prospectively evaluated. Dogs were sedated immediately before CT pulmonary angiography using intravenous butorphanol. Spiral CT pulmonary angiography was performed with a 16 detector-row CT scanner using a pressure injector to infuse contrast media through peripheral intravenous catheters. Pulmonary thromboembolism was diagnosed using predefined criteria. Contemporaneous tests included echocardiography, arterial blood gas analysis, kaolin-activated thromboelastography, D-dimers and cardiac troponins. Results Based on predefined criteria, four dogs were classified as pulmonary thromboembolism positive, three dogs were suspected to have pulmonary thromboembolism and the remaining five dogs had negative scans. The four dogs identified with pulmonary thromboembolism all had discrete filling defects in main or lobar pulmonary arteries. None of the contemporaneous tests was discriminant for pulmonary thromboembolism diagnosis, although the small sample size was limiting. Clinical Significance CT pulmonary angiography can be successfully performed in dogs under sedation, even in at-risk patients with respiratory distress and can both confirm and rule out pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs.

Nevertheless, there are several important areas of controversy with regard to the surgical approach, differences of which may impact the rate of success and the incidence of adverse effects. Cognitive sequelae of temporal lobe surgery may result from (1) resection or transgression of the lateral (neocortical) temporal lobe or the temporal stem, which may lead to impairment in learning, and/or (2) resection of mesial structures, which may lead to decline in material-specific memory. The recent multi-center clinical trial analyzing the predictors of post-surgical quality-of-life will be discussed, including the finding that improvement depends on seizure-freedom irrespective of the occurrence of verbal memory decline. Nevertheless, it is incumbent on surgeons to minimize the occurrence of these cognitive sequelae while maximizing the possibility of seizure-freedom. Several approaches to gain access to the mesial structures will be compared with regard to cognitive outcome, including anterior temporal lobectomy (standard vs. tailored), trans-cortical selective AH and trans-sylvian selective AH, which differ in terms of their disruption of the temporal neocortex and temporal stem. Alternative approaches to the mesial resection will be compared with regard to seizure-free rates and the incidence of post-surgical decline in memory, including tailoring the hippocampal resection to the presence of inter-ictal epileptic spikes vs. performing a standardized resection, and the influence of the amount of hippocampal tissue resected. Open discussion of recent results addressing these important issues will hopefully either propel the field towards consensus, or highlight the need for further randomized clinical trials to improve patient outcome following amygdalo-hippocampectomy for MTLE.

AB  - Abstract Colon cancer is one of the most common malignancies among populations in the United States and Western Europe, and one of the leading causes of worldwide morbidity and mortality due to cancer. The early detection of colon cancer is central to the effective treatment of this disease and early detection markers are needed. We have demonstrated that high-resolution two-dimensional gel analysis of nuclear matrix proteins (NMPs) demonstrated a specific oncological fingerprint of colon cancer. Utilizing this approach, four proteins specific for colon cancer was identified. Additionally, one protein was expressed much more strongly in colon cancer compared to adjacent and normal donor tissue. The amino acid composition of this protein revealed sequence similarity with calreticulin. The multi-functional protein, calreticulin, is normally found in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum although some reports have described a nuclear localization of the protein. The aim of this study was to confirm the identity of the protein as calreticulin as well as to evaluate the localization of calreticulin in the nuclear matrix of colon cancer tissue. J. Cell.

AB  - Abstract Although the medical profession is slowly realizing that many disorders in the aged must be treated differently than in the young, there is still no proper appreciation of these age differences. Too often, when a patient reaches life-expectancy age, the physician relaxes his medical attention. It is assumed that the patient will die soon, although the actuarial statistics may show that he has many more years of life. Accordingly, therapy should be more intensive in order to attain the maximal life span. Elderly people will tolerate many major operations (e.g., herniorrhaphy or thyroidectomy) as well as young people. However, when it comes to serious major operations (e.g., radical neck dissection or radical excision of the rectum for carcinoma), the mortality rate for the aged may be four to eight times higher than for young patients. Elderly patients tolerate emergency major operations and complications very poorly. The chronologic age is not the chief factor in the mortality rate; more important are the operative complications. Therefore, preoperatively, every effort should be made to identify and treat diseases that might cause complications postoperatively. After operation a close watch must be kept for complications so that they may be treated promptly and effectively. Operative technic must be meticulous, with no excessive trauma and with particular attention to hemostasis and wound closure. The operation should be completed in the shortest possible time consistent with safety. A summary of 6 reports in the medical literature shows an operative mortality rate for major operations of 2.6 per cent in patients under 60, compared to 7.2 per cent for patients over 60. The mortality rate for emergency operations is much higher than for elective operations?18.5 per cent versus 6.5 per cent, respectively. A summary of 4 reports shows that cardiac complications were the greatest single cause of postoperative mortality (21.6 per cent), with pneumonia and atelectasis a close second. Despite precautions such as bandaging the extremities and early ambulation, pulmonary embolism accounted for 9.4 per cent of the deaths. [Though inoperable carcinoma caused more deaths (22.2 per cent of the entire group) than any of the other diseases, it is classified as a multiple cause.] Since the mortality rate for major operations in both aged and young patients is still significant, there is great need for more accuracy in determining operability.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents the special applications, which are advanced principles for maximising the full potential of digital dental photography. These include taking additional images for elucidating certain features, or analysing images for effective communicating with patients and fellow colleagues. Whilst the essential dental portfolio, essential portrait portfolio and optional images are sufficient for most modalities, some procedures require specific types of imagery for multi-diagnosis and facilitating collaborative care. In order to demonstrate detailed analysis of hard and soft tissues, the case study shows replacement of defective composite restorations in the maxillary sextant. The photographic set-up uses a single compact flash as the key light on one side, which alternates from the right to left with a silver reflector on the opposite side. Treatment sequencing involves documenting step-by-step clinical or laboratory techniques. Also, a sequence of images can demonstrate the use of particular instruments or materials for a restorative or surgical modality.

AB  - Abstract We have recently shown that stimulation, through a multi-electrode array, of thin nerve fibres close to the dermo-epidermal junction in the skin, produces powerful inhibition of itch and, to a lesser degree, cutaneous pain in humans. Here, we have studied the induction time and frequency dependency (range 1?10 Hz) of the inhibitory effects of such stimulation on itch, mechanical, and thermal pain, in 20 healthy subjects. Sixteen electrodes applied on the skin were consecutively stimulated using a method termed cutaneous field stimulation (CFS). The results show that different treatment periods with CFS were required for the induction of significant inhibitory effects on different nociceptive qualities: 1st heat pain (1 min), itch (3 min), 2nd heat pain (6 min), pinch evoked pain (8 min). Six to ten minutes stimulation sufficed to induce peak inhibitory effects on all these sensory qualities while longer stimulation (up to 40 min) did not cause significantly stronger inhibition. The effects on itch, 1st and 2nd heat pain lasted over 55 min after termination of CFS. There was no effect on prickle. No significant difference in inhibitory effects of different stimulation frequencies (1, 4 and 10 Hz/electrode) was found. The induction time and effective stimulation frequencies may suggest that the underlying mechanisms are similar to those of long term depression (LTD) previously described in the spinal cord in animal experiments.

AB  - Summary ?? We report the first use of tracer 13NH4+ (13N-ammonium) efflux and retention data to analyse subcellular fluxes and compartmentation of NH4+ in the leaves of a higher plant (wheat, Triticum aestivum). ?? Leaf segments, 1?2 mm, were obtained from 8-d-old seedlings. The viability of the segments, and stability of NH 4 + acquisition over time, were confirmed using oxygen-exchange and NH 4 + -depletion measurements. Fluxes of NH 4 + and compartment sizes were estimated using tracer efflux kinetics and retention data. ?? Influx and efflux across the plasma membrane, half-lives of exchange and cytosolic pool sizes were broadly similar to those in root systems. As the external concentration of NH 4 + ([NH 4 + ] o ) increased from 10 µ m to 10 m m , both influx and efflux greatly increased, with a sixfold increase in the ratio of efflux to influx. Half-lives were similar among treatments, except at [NH 4 + ] o  = 10 m m , where they declined. Concentrations of NH 4 + in the cytosol ([NH 4 + ] c ) increased from 2.6 to 400 m m . ?? Although [NH 4 + ] c became large as [NH 4 + ] o increased, the ratio of [NH 4 + ] c to [NH 4 + ] o decreased more than sixfold. The apparently futile cycling of NH 4 + at high [NH 4 + ] o suggested by the large fluxes of NH 4 + in both directions across the membrane indicate that leaf cells respond to potentially toxic NH 4 + concentrations in a manner similar to root cells.

AB  - Summary Interleukin (IL)-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine now widely recognized to contribute to the molecular events that follow CNS injury. Little is known, however, about its action on axonal sprouting and regeneration in the brain. We addressed this issue using the model of transection of Schaffer collaterals in mice organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. Transection of slice cultures was associated with a marked release of IL-6 that could be neutralized by an IL-6 blocking antibody. We monitored functional recovery across the lesion by recording synaptic responses using a multi-electrode array. We found that application of IL-6 antibodies to the cultures after lesioning significantly reduced functional recovery across the lesion. Furthermore, the level of expression of the 43-kDa growth-associated protein (GAP-43) was lower in slices treated with the IL-6 neutralizing antibody than in those treated with a control IgG. Conversely, addition of exogenous IL-6 to the culture medium resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of functional recovery across the lesion and a higher level of expression of GAP-43. Co-culture of CA3 hemi-slices from thy1-YFP mice with CA1 hemi-slices from wild-type animals confirmed that IL-6-treated co-cultures exhibited an increased number of growing fluorescent fibres across the lesion site. Taken together these data indicate that IL-6 plays an important role in CNS repair mechanisms by promoting regrowth and axon regeneration.

AB  - Summary An investigation of 78 cases of typical Australian Stringhalt from 52 properties in Victoria was carried out from 1985 to 1987. Horses were either examined in the field (n = 52), referred to the Veterinary Clinical Centre (n = 13) or clinical details were obtained verbally (n = 13). In addition 10 cases of false or atypical stringhalt were examined. Detailed soil and pasture analysis was carried out on 14 properties where Australian Stringhalt had occurred. Information was also obtained on epidemiology of the condition from a survey of practitioners. Fifty of the 52 cases examined in the field occurred in horses that were dependent upon poor quality unimproved dry pasture. In all but a few cases, there was no pasture improvement or fertiliser application, leading to the development of weed-dominated pastures, particularly by flatweed, Hypochaeris radicata. The range of clinical signs exhibited by horses with Australian Stringhalt was described and a grading system proposed to classify horses according to severity of signs. Laryngeal abnormalities were present in 10 of 11 cases examined endoscopically and these horses exhibited increased electromyographic (EMG) activity in the long digital extensor muscle at rest and during hindlimb flexion. To a large extent, the EMG changes disappeared and digital extensor muscle atrophy improved in two horses that were monitored to recovery. Deep peroneal nerve conduction studies in four horses with Australian Stringhalt showed a substantial reduction in nerve conduction velocity and when stimulated at 50 Hz were unable to sustain activation of the long digital extensor muscle. EMG and evoked responses appeared to be sensitive indicators of the state of the disease. Spontaneous recovery over a period ranging from a few days to over 18 months occurred in 78 per cent (45 out of 58) of field cases available for follow up, although eight horses were destroyed on humane grounds or for pathological investigation.
