AB  - Summary An investigation of 78 cases of typical Australian Stringhalt from 52 properties in Victoria was carried out from 1985 to 1987. Horses were either examined in the field (n = 52), referred to the Veterinary Clinical Centre (n = 13) or clinical details were obtained verbally (n = 13). In addition 10 cases of false or atypical stringhalt were examined. Detailed soil and pasture analysis was carried out on 14 properties where Australian Stringhalt had occurred. Information was also obtained on epidemiology of the condition from a survey of practitioners. Fifty of the 52 cases examined in the field occurred in horses that were dependent upon poor quality unimproved dry pasture. In all but a few cases, there was no pasture improvement or fertiliser application, leading to the development of weed-dominated pastures, particularly by flatweed, Hypochaeris radicata. The range of clinical signs exhibited by horses with Australian Stringhalt was described and a grading system proposed to classify horses according to severity of signs. Laryngeal abnormalities were present in 10 of 11 cases examined endoscopically and these horses exhibited increased electromyographic (EMG) activity in the long digital extensor muscle at rest and during hindlimb flexion. To a large extent, the EMG changes disappeared and digital extensor muscle atrophy improved in two horses that were monitored to recovery. Deep peroneal nerve conduction studies in four horses with Australian Stringhalt showed a substantial reduction in nerve conduction velocity and when stimulated at 50 Hz were unable to sustain activation of the long digital extensor muscle. EMG and evoked responses appeared to be sensitive indicators of the state of the disease. Spontaneous recovery over a period ranging from a few days to over 18 months occurred in 78 per cent (45 out of 58) of field cases available for follow up, although eight horses were destroyed on humane grounds or for pathological investigation.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare palpation-guided with ultrasound-guided brachial plexus blockade in Hispaniolan Amazon parrots. Study design? Prospective randomized experimental trial. Animals? Eighteen adult Hispaniolan Amazon parrots (Amazona ventralis) weighing 252?295?g. Methods? After induction of anesthesia with isoflurane, parrots received an injection of lidocaine (2?mg?kg?1) in a total volume of 0.3?mL at the axillary region. The birds were randomly assigned to equal groups using either palpation or ultrasound as a guide for the brachial plexus block. Nerve evoked muscle potentials (NEMP) were used to monitor effectiveness of brachial plexus block. The palpation-guided group received the local anesthetic at the space between the pectoral muscle, triceps, and supracoracoideus aticimus muscle, at the insertion of the tendons of the caudal coracobrachial muscle, and the caudal scapulohumeral muscle. For the ultrasound-guided group, the brachial plexus and the adjacent vessels were located with B-mode ultrasonography using a 7?15?MHz linear probe. After location, an 8-5?MHz convex transducer was used to guide injections. General anesthesia was discontinued 20?minutes after lidocaine injection and the birds recovered in a padded cage. Results? Both techniques decreased the amplitude of NEMP. Statistically significant differences in NEMP amplitudes, were observed within the ultrasound-guided group at 5, 10, 15, and 20?minutes after injection and within the palpation-guided group at 10, 15, and 20?minutes after injection. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. No effect on motor function, muscle relaxation or wing droop was observed after brachial plexus block. Conclusions and clinical relevance? The onset of the brachial plexus block tended to be faster when ultrasonography was used. Brachial plexus injection can be performed in Hispaniolan Amazon parrots and nerve evoked muscle potentials were useful to monitor the effects on nerve conduction in this avian species. Neither technique produced an effective block at the doses of lidocaine used and further study is necessary to develop a useful block for surgical analgesia.

AB  - Background.? One of the greatest diagnostic challenges in clinical practice is the accurate assessment of pulp status. This may be further complicated in paediatric dentistry where the practitioner is faced with a developing dentition, traumatized teeth, or young children who have a limited ability to recall a pain history for the tooth in question. A variety of pulp testing approaches exist, and there may be confusion as to their validity or appropriateness in different clinical situations. Aim.? The aim of this paper is to provide the clinician with a comprehensive review of current pulp testing methods. A key objective is to highlight the difference between sensitivity testing and vitality testing. A biological basis for pulp testing is also provided to allow greater insight into the interpretation of pulp testing results. The rationale for, and methods of, assessing pulpal blood flow are described.

AB  - Abstract Crushing or transecting the chorda tympani nerve of the gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) caused ipsilateral degeneration of taste buds in the fungiform papillae. In less than two weeks some taste fibers regenerated into the tongue and formed new taste buds and receptor cells. The recovery process was evaluated electrophysiologically in 53 gerbils by acute recording proximal to the nerve injury site. Initially the chorda tympani was electrically silent. In gerbils tested at later times spontaneous activity appeared. This was followed by responses to pressure on the tongue. Taste responses returned as early as dasy 11. The receptive field of regenerated taste fibers was limited to a small number of fungiform papillae. Taste responses were always associasted with the presence of one or more taste buds in the receptive field. Taste buds identified as responsive to chemicals contained some fusiform cells. We found thast the taste responses of single fiber, few-fiber and multi-unit preparations reflected the diversity of responses found in normal taste axons as determined by recording from 26 normal single fibers and 27 normal whole nerves. The early emergence of a variety of fiber types and responses to many chemicals in regeneration is inconsistent with the proposition that the relative chemical responsiveness of a receptor cell is strictly a function of its age; the response of a given young taste receptor is not necessarily limited to a few of the standard taste stimulants.

This review focuses on bark defenses, a front line against organisms trying to reach the nutrient-rich phloem. A major breach of the bark can lead to tree death, as evidenced by the millions of trees killed every year by specialized bark-invading insects. Different defense strategies have arisen in conifer lineages, but the general strategy is one of overlapping constitutive mechanical and chemical defenses overlaid with the capacity to up-regulate additional defenses. The defense strategy incorporates a graded response from ?repel?, through ?defend? and ?kill?, to ?compartmentalize?, depending upon the advance of the invading organism. Using a combination of toxic and polymer chemistry, anatomical structures and their placement, and inducible defenses, conifers have evolved bark defense mechanisms that work against a variety of pests. However, these can be overcome by strategies including aggregation pheromones of bark beetles and introduction of virulent phytopathogens. The defense structures and chemicals in conifer bark are reviewed and questions about their coevolution with bark beetles are discussed.

AB  - Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy (MSBP) or Fictitious Illness by Proxy, the fabrication or induction of illness in a child, is a recognized form of child abuse in many countries. As such it is subject to inquiry under child protection legislation. Child protection legislation and practice guidance in Australia, the USA and most European countries requires professionals from a variety of disciplines to work together regarding the recognition, investigation and short and long-term assessment of the case. However, practitioners and managers find cases of MSBP difficult to manage at personal, professional and organizational levels. This paper identifies some of the tensions and dilemmas encountered by professionals when working with suspected cases of MSBP. Consideration is given to the impact that this has on multi-disciplinary practice in terms of working in partnership with other professionals and the family. The paper includes suggestions for promoting effective inter-agency practice to protect children who are the victims of this form of abuse.

AB  - Background Postoperative inflammation is a common consequence of surgery and the ensuing stress response. Local anesthetics have anti-inflammatory properties. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate if LA administrated intraperitoneally perioperatively might inhibit expression of inflammatory cytokines. Methods This was a, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study (ClinicalTrial.gov reg no: NCT02256228) in patients undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer. Patients were randomized to receive: intraperitoneal ropivacaine (Group IPLA) or saline (Group P) perioperatively. Except for study drug, patients were treated similarly. At the end of surgery, a multi-port catheter was inserted intraperitoneally, and ropivacaine 2Â mg/mL or 0.9% saline, 10Â mL was injected intermittently every other hour during 72Â hours postoperatively. Systemic expression of cytokines and plasma ropivacaine were determined before and 6, 24, and 48Â hours after surgery. Stress response was measured by serum glucose, cortisol, and insulin. Results Forty patients were recruited, 20 in each group. There was no statistical significant difference in systemic cytokine between the groups at any time point. Serum cortisol was significantly lower in the IPLA group at 6Â hours, median 103Â nmol/L (IQR 53-250) compared to placebo, median 440Â nmol/L (IQR 115-885), PÂ =Â 0.023. Serum glucose and insulin were similar between the groups. Total and free serum concentrations of ropivacaine were well below toxic concentrations. Conclusion In this small study, perioperative intraperitoneal ropivacaine did not reduce the systemic inflammatory response associated with major abdominal surgery. Total and free ropivacaine concentrations were below known toxic concentrations in humans.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare pulmonary function and gas exchange in ponies during maintenance of anaesthesia with isoflurane or by a total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) technique. Study design Experimental, cross?over study. Animals Six healthy ponies weighing mean 286 (range 233?388)Â Â±Â SD 61Â kg, age 13 (9?16) Â± 3Â years. Methods The ponies were anaesthetized twice, a minimum of twoÂ weeks apart. Following sedation with romifidine [80Â ?gÂ kg?1 intravenously (IV)], anaesthesia was induced IV with midazolam (0.06Â mgÂ kg?1) and ketamine (2.5Â mgÂ kg?1), then maintained either with inhaled isoflurane (Fe?IsoÂ =Â 1.1 vol%) (T-ISO) or an IV infusion of romifidine (120Â ?gÂ kg?1Â hour?1), midazolam (0.09Â mgÂ kg?1Â hour?1 IV) and ketamine (3.3Â mgÂ kg?1Â hour?1) (T-TIVA). Ponies were placed in lateral recumbency. Breathing was spontaneous and Fi?O2 60%. After an instrumentation/stabilisation period of 30Â minutes, arterial and mixed venous blood samples were taken simultaneously every 10Â minutes for 60Â minutes and analysed immediately. Oxygen extraction ratio (O2ER) and venous admixture were calculated. Tidal volume (TV), minute volume (MV), respiratory rate (fR), packed cell volume (PCV), arterial blood pressure and heart rate (HR) were measured and recorded. Data were analysed with mixed model anova (Î±Â =Â 0.05). Treatments were compared overall and at two selected time points (T30 and T60) using Bonferroni correction. Results Arterial and mixed venous partial pressures of O2 and CO2, and TV were significantly lower and MV and fR were higher in T-TIVA compared to T-ISO. Venous admixture did not differ between treatments. O2ER was significantly higher in T-TIVA. Mean arterial pressure was higher and HR was lower in T-TIVA compared to T-ISO. Conclusions and clinical relevance Whilst arterial CO2 was within an acceptable range during both protocols, the impairment of oxygenation was more pronounced with the T-TIVA evidenced by lower arterial and venous oxygen partial pressures.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Insulin resistance (IR) can be difficult to diagnose from basal insulin and glucose concentrations, so a field-based oral sugar test (OST) is preferred. However, the repeatability of this test has not been reported. Objectives To determine the repeatability of an in-feed OST in ponies. Study design A repeated measures, longitudinal study. Methods Eight mixed-breed ponies received an in-feed OST at 08.00?h, after an overnight fast, once weekly for 3 weeks. D-glucose powder (0.75?g/kg bwt), wheat bran (200?g) and water (500?ml) were combined, and mixed with lucerne chaff (0.3% bwt). Blood samples were taken before, and 90 and 180?min after, feeding. All meals were consumed. Blood glucose concentration was determined immediately and serum was obtained for insulin determination by equine-specific ELISA. Fasting glucose, insulin and glucose:insulin ratios were used to classify ponies as IR, compensated IR or normal on each occasion and the results were compared to the OST. Results Diagnosis of IR from basal values was consistent in only 3/8 ponies, with a large mean coefficient of variation (CV) of 51% for baseline insulin, across tests. The OST results were repeatable in 7/8 ponies, with mean CV at 25% for the 90?min insulin sample (CV for 7 ponies: 19%). The OST was repeatable on 2/3 occasions in the eighth pony, however, resting hyperinsulinaemia meant that IR was diagnosed on 3/3 occasions using basal values in this pony. There was significant (P<0.05) variability in insulin concentration at 180?min, but not 90?min, across tests. Conclusions An OST is more repeatable when assessing IR in ponies than basal values/ratios. Both resting hyperinsulinaemia and insulin responses to oral sugar can be assessed with the OST, which increases the likelihood of accurately diagnosing IR. Blood sampling at 90?min post feeding is recommended for more consistent results. Ethical animal research:?The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Queensland (SVS/QUT/109/13/QUT).

AB  - Reasons for performing study Commingling of horses from various populations, together with stress associated with transport and confinement at a sales complex, may predispose horses to EHV-1 and -4 shedding and transmission. Current information on the prevalence and associated risk factors of EHV-1 and -4 in South Africa is limited. Relevant research could enhance scientific-based risk management strategies for horses attending sales events. Objectives Detect nasal shedding of EHV-1 and -4 at a sales event. Identify the temporal pattern of viral shedding. Investigate the association between clinical signs and EHV-1 and -4 shedding. Identify risk factors for EHV-1 and -4 shedding and transmission. Study design Prospective cohort study. Methods Data was collected over a 9 day period during August 2013 at the National Two Year Old Sales in Germiston, South Africa. The study population included 90 Thoroughbreds (51 colts, 39 fillies) in their second year of life that originated from 8 studs situated in 3 provinces. Nasal swabs were collected from each horse on arrival and on departure from the event. During their stay horses were monitored twice daily for pyrexia and once daily for nasal discharge. Nasal swabs were collected daily from any horse with nasal discharge and/or pyrexia. Nasal swabs were submitted for qPCR to detect EHV-1 and -4. Results No EHV-1 shedding was detected; however, 14.4% of the population shed EHV-4. A biphasic shedding pattern with peaks one day post arrival and on the first day of auction was observed. Pyrexia, with or without nasal discharge, was observed prior to first shedding in 61.5% of EHV-4-positive horses. Province, associated longer travel duration and smaller resident horse populations on farms of origin were associated with increased risk of EHV-4 shedding. Conclusions Young Thoroughbreds consigned to a South African sale shed EHV-4. Pyrexia proved useful to identify impending EHV-4 shedding. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee (AEC) of the University of Pretoria (Study V040-13). Informed, written consent for participation was obtained from the owners of each of the studs included in the study.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There are approximately 100 million working equids in developing countries worldwide. These animals? role in impoverished communities is generally unrecognised by national and international policy makers and their needs are overlooked in national animal health systems. Additionally, despite increased international development attention on women and livestock, the specific contributions of equids to poor womens? lives are also unquantified and overlooked. Objectives This study aimed to document the relationship between working equids and women in equine owning communities in Ethiopia, India, Kenya and Pakistan. Study design Qualitative semi-structured focus group discussions elicited opinions from small groups of women (up to 12/group) in selected rural and peri-urban areas in each country. Methods An experienced local language-speaking community facilitator guided each discussion using a standardised questionnaire based on UK Department for International Development sustainable livelihoods framework asset categories. Women's experiences of working equids? roles in their lives were audio-recorded, transcribed in local language and key themes summarised in English. Results Twenty-two discussions (7 in India, 5 each in Ethiopia, Kenya and Pakistan) comprising 259 women took place between February and October 2013. When asked to rank their livestock, all 12 groups in India and Kenya and 17 out of 22 groups overall ranked equids most important, due to their income generation and contribution to household chores, including transporting feedstuffs and water for other livestock species. Whilst specific responsibilities varied between communities, women reported undertaking many equine husbandry activities but lacked access to equine-specific knowledge and skills training. Conclusions The study findings can inform development of targeted training interventions for female working equid owners and users. Further work is required to quantify the contribution to livelihoods of working equids in developing countries to underpin engagement with government stakeholders on the benefit of providing for their needs in animal health and welfare systems.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Real-time tissue elastography (RTE) can provide objective information associated with mechanical properties of tendon tissue and add value to the structural information obtained by greyscale ultrasound. Serial RTE assessment would be useful for monitoring and optimising safe rehabilitation for horses with tendon injury. Objectives To test the hypothesis that RTE could measure change in tissue stiffness in the healing process of injured superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) of horses. Study design Prospective field study. Methods Six Thoroughbred horses with SDFT injury and standardised rehabilitation were used. Both greyscale and RTE images were recorded approximately every 4 weeks up to 40 weeks from occurrence. Greyscale ratio (GR: dividing the grey-value of injured area by it of surrounding noninjured area) and strain ratio (SR: dividing the strain value of stand-off gel pad, which can be a standard, by it of injured area) was calculated at each examination. Tissue strain is displayed by colour which suggests hard (blue), intermediate (yellow), soft (red) on RTE image. Strain of injured area was evaluated by colour-scale grade (CSG) of 1 to 3 (1; blue to green, 2; yellow and 3; red) by 3 veterinarians who didn't know the case history. Results GR was returned to nearly 1 quickly within 8 weeks and it was unchanged thereafter. This continuous change of GR was best-fitted to logarithmic trendline (r2?=?0.66). SR increased gradually up to the last examination and was best-fitted to linear trendline (r2?=?0.89). CSG was decreased gradually and it was best-fitted to linear trendline (r2?=?0.84). Both change of SR and CSG suggested that an injured tissue would gradually increase in stiffness. Conclusions RTE could provide useful information regarding monitoring and optimising restoration of the tissue stiffness of tendon, even if GR was unchanged by progress of scar formation, for safer and more effective rehabilitation.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There is limited information on tarsocrural arthroscopy for osteochondrosis dissecans lesions (OCD) in Great Britain, and routine examination of the plantar pouch has not been described. Objectives To describe clinical features of cases undergoing tarsocrural arthroscopy for OCD and estimate the prevalence of abnormalities within the plantar pouch. Study design Retrospective case review. Methods Case records of all horses that had tarsocrural arthroscopy for OCD at Rossdales Equine Hospital between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2013 were included (n?=?99). Descriptive data and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were constructed in Microsoft Excel. Results Warmbloods/Warmblood-crosses were significantly over-represented compared to the normal hospital population, comprising 42.4% (CI 32.7?52.2%) of the study (P<0.001), followed by Thoroughbreds/Thoroughbred-crosses (33.7%, CI 25.0?43.7%), 22 other horse breeds and one pony. Cases were predominantly male (70.7%, CI 63.6?81.3%) with 48.5% geldings, 19.2% colts and 3.0% stallions. Median age was 2.9 years (0.1?13.5 years) and median weight was 523?kg (112?919?kg). Most were nonracing sports horses (40.4%, CI 30.7?50.1%), or unbroken (27.0%, CI 18.5?36.0%) with the remainder used for breeding, general purpose or racing. Reasons for presentation were lameness (52.7%, CI 42.5?63.0%), effusion (36.3%, CI 26.4?46.1%), or survey radiographs (11.0%, CI 4.6?17.4%). Tarsocrural arthroscopy was most frequently performed bilaterally (41.8%, CI 32.1?51.6%), followed by left hind (35.7%, CI 26.2?45.2%), then right hind (22.4%, CI 14.2?30.7%). Irrespective of pathology in the dorsal pouch, examination of the plantar pouch was performed in 70 joints (50 horses), and in 78.0% (CI 66.5?89.5%) abnormalities were found. Of these, 10 required removal of organised fibrinous debris or osteochondral fragments (25.6% CI 11.9?39.3%), none of which were recorded using diagnostic imaging presurgery. Conclusions Investigation of the plantar pouch is indicated in routine tarsocrural arthroscopy for OCD as it often reveals additional pathology, which may necessitate surgical intervention. Further work will evaluate how plantar pouch pathology may influence prognosis. Ethical animal research:?Ethical approval obtained, project number AHT48-2013.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To evaluate the isoflurane-sparing and clinical effects of two constant rate infusions of remifentanil in healthy dogs undergoing orthopaedic surgery. Study design? Prospective, randomized clinical study. Animals? Forty-one American Society of Anesthesiologists I-II client-owned dogs (age, 7 months?9?years; body mass 11?59?kg). Methods? Dogs were randomly assigned to one of three groups and received either: intramuscular (IM) meperidine 2?mg?kg?1 every 2?hours throughout surgery (control group (C); n?=?13); remifentanil infused intravenously (IV) at 0.1??g?kg?1?minute?1 (low remifentanil group (L); n?=?14) or remifentanil infused at 0.25??g?kg?1?minute?1 IV (high remifentanil group (H); n?=?14). Anaesthesia was induced with thiopental administered to effect and maintained using isoflurane in 100% oxygen. During controlled ventilation when the end-tidal CO2 was maintained between 4.65 and 5.98?kPa [35?45?mmHg], the end-tidal isoflurane concentration (e?iso%), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were measured every 5?minutes. Bradycardia (HR?<?40?minute?1 lasting >5?minutes) was corrected with 0.01?mg?kg?1 IV glycopyrrolate. Data were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test with a post-hoc Mann?Whitney U-test and Bonferroni correction. Statistical significance was accepted at â‰¤?0.05. Data are expressed as mean?Â±?standard deviation. Results? The e?iso% was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by remifentanil. In C, e?iso% was 1.28?Â±0.13 and was significantly different from L (0.78?Â±?0.17, p?<?0.001) and H (0.65?Â±?0.16, p?<?0.001). HR was significantly different between groups (p?<?0.001). There were no significant differences in MAP between groups. Glycopyrrolate was required in two, three and six dogs in the C, L and H groups respectively. Conclusions? Remifentanil infusion reduced the isoflurane concentration required for surgical anaesthesia during orthopaedic surgery. Clinical relevance? Remifentanil infusions may be a useful additive to isoflurane anaesthesia in healthy dogs.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Soaked grass hays are recommended for the nutritional-management of equine metabolic syndrome (EMS). Forage provision is commonly restricted to promote weight-loss and insulin-sensitivity. When EMS animals were fed hay at ?1.25% body mass (BM) as daily dry matter (DM) (presoaking) animals lost weight at 1.1% of outset BM weekly. This doubled weight-losses recorded when horses were fed fresh/?un-soaked? hay to the same level [1]. Objectives To compare the composition and digestibility of fresh/soaked grass-hays to improve nutritional-guidance for the management of EMS. Study design Following 6 weeks of dietary restriction to 1.25%BM as hay-DM, 6/12 horses which had participated in an earlier study [2], were used to determine the digestibility of the soaked (n?=?3) and fresh (n?=?3) hays. Methods Samples of fresh grass-hay (n?=?6) and hay from the same batch which had been water-soaked overnight (16?h, n?=?6) or by day (7?h, n?=?6) were dried for the measurement of DM content, pooled and ground. Nutrient and gross energy (GE) compositions were determined by proximate analyses. Animals were fed hay as 2 daily meals. Soaked-hay was equal-parts long/short-soaked. Apparent digestibilities were determined after total faecal collection for 72?h. Results Soaking hay; did not alter GE (17.6?MJ/kg DM), increased acid detergent fibre (ADF) (30?35%), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) (68?74%) and crude protein (CP, 8.4?10.6%), decreased water soluble carbohydrate (WSC, 18.2?12.2%), and mineral contents (5.7?4.2%). Digestibilities of GE, DM, ash, NDF and WSC were unaltered by soaking. Conversely, soaking increased CP (55.6?66.8%) and ADF (37.5?50%) digestibility. However, hay-soaking elicits un-quantified losses of DM. Previous studies report hay ADF and CP as ?water-insoluble?. When DM losses were retrospectively calculated from the ADF and CP content of fresh and soaked-hays, daily DM provision decreased from 1.25 to 1.14%. Consequently DE decreased by 25% (119.5?89.7?kj/kg BM/day). Conclusions Dry matter losses from hay-soaking have marked impacts on energy/nutrient provision and increase the severity of dietary restriction.

AB  - Reasons for performing study To introduce and assess the feasibility of multipulse transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) in horses. Objectives To assess latency times of muscular motor evoked potentials (MEP) in the m. extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and the m. tibialis cranialis (TC), elicited by transcranially applied multipulse stimulation in 12 healthy horses. Study design Prospective observational study applied in 12 healthy horses. Methods Horses with a mean age of 11.0 (range 3.6?20.5) years and a height of 160 (s.d.?Â±?10.0) cm were studied. Horses were sedated with detomidin (1.5??g/kg bwt) and butorphanol (1.5??g/kg bwt) i.v. A subcutaneous ring block with lidocaine 2%?+?adrenaline was placed on the forehead. TES was performed using biphasic high frequency multipulse voltage trains (pulse width: 0.1?ms, interpulse interval: 1.3?ms, 3 pulses/train) applied to 2 subcutaneous needle electrodes bilateral from the centre of the forehead. Latency times (30?V above motor threshold (MT) and amplitude of MEP were recorded bilaterally at the ECR and the TC muscles. Motor latency times are expressed as mean?Â±?2?s.d. Results Mean latency times (at MT?+?30?V) for the ECR muscles were respectively 20.18?Â±?1.85?ms (left side) and 19.7?Â±?1.69?ms (right side) and for the TC muscles respectively: 34.6?Â±?2.01?ms (left) and 34.9?Â±?2.43?ms (right). Conclusions TES is well tolerated. Interestingly, recorded motor latency times at the level of front and hind legs appear to be shorter for TES when compared to TMS from literature data [1].

AB  - Reasons for performing study We have already demonstrated that vaccination with empty BPV1 capsids termed virus-like particles (VLP) protects horses from experimental infection with BPV1 virion. Long-term monitoring of antibody titres in experimental horses and data from other species suggest that this protection is long lasting. Objectives To test protection against experimental infection with BPV-1 virion in horses that were vaccinated with BPV-1 L1 VLP approximately 5 years earlier. Study design Controlled experiment. Methods Seven horses, vaccinated 3 times (boosters after 4 weeks and 6 months) in 2007/2008 with doses of BPV1 L1 VLP ranging from 50??g to 150??g/dose and 3 unvaccinated control horses were challenged by intra-dermal inoculation with cow wart derived BPV1 virion (5???107 BPV-1 virions per wheal, 10 wheals per horse). Inoculation sites were monitored for 10 weeks. Blood for serum antibody titre determination by pseudovirion neutralisation assay was taken on the day of challenge and after 6 months. Results Six of 7 vaccinated horses had measurable serum antibody titres (1:50 to 1:400). These titres were boosted by inoculation (about one step of dilution). Two of 3 unvaccinated controls remained sero-negative. One control horse showed sero-conversion. All control horses developed tumours at all 10 inoculation sites. Tumours appeared approximately 2 weeks after inoculation and reached maximum sizes of up to 8?mm. Regression was complete by 8 weeks after their first appearance in all horses. All vaccinated horses remained completely free from tumours. No influence of dose rate or antibody titre on the level of protection could be determined. Conclusions BPV-1 L1 VLP vaccination proves to be fully effective in protecting horses from experimental infection and tumour formation 5 years post immunisation. The protection was complete even in horses with low or unmeasurable antibody titres. This is another step towards establishing a vaccination against equine sarcoids.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Most complications in equine castrations result from insufficient ligation and contamination. Objectives Stapling instruments reduce tissue handling, decrease surgical time, minimise contamination and provide secure visceral and vascular closure when used correctly. Using a stapler device might therefore increase ligation security and decrease contamination, and by this, reduce the complication rate seen in routine castration. Study design The applicability and safety of a TA-30 premium stapler as a ligation method in castration of the horse was tested in 15 horses under general anaesthesia in dorsal recumbency. Three horses were cryptorchids, one horse suffered a scirrous chord, and one horse suffered an infectious orchitis. Methods The vaginal process was approached inguinally. A noncutting emasculator was applied to compress the closed vaginal process. Consecutively a TA-30 Premium stapler was applied to the compressed site. The distal part of the vaginal process was then removed, the stapler device was released and the incision was closed. The TA-30 stapler accommodates 3 different staple cartridges of 30?mm width, accommodating 1.0 to 2.5?mm tissue thickness. The thickness of the vaginal process after compression was measured to be 1.0?mm (0.9?1.1?mm) in 10 fresh specimens. The 30-V3 cartridges (triple row, 1?mm closed diameter) were chosen in 9 horses with smaller vaginal processes and the 30-3.5 cartridges (double row 1.5?mm closed diameter) in 6 other horses with larger vaginal processes. Results All horses recovered without intra- or post operative complications. Conclusions A TA-30 stapler is a safe ligation instrument in equine castrations. The use of titanium staples may reduce infection rate in routine castrations, even more in ligation of precontaminated vaginal processes in cases of post operative haemorrhage control after practice castrations or in closing the vaginal process after the removal of an infected testis or scirrous chord.
