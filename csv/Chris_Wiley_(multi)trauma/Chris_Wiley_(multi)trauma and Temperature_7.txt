AB  - Abstract Aims To evaluate multi-frequency tactilometry as a method to measure vibrotactile sense in the sole of the foot in subjects with diabetes. Methods Vibration thresholds were investigated at five frequencies (8, 16, 32, 64 and 125 Hz) at three sites (first and fifth metatarsal heads and heel) in the sole of the foot in subjects with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes (n = 37). Thresholds were compared with healthy, age- and gender-matched subjects (n = 37) and related to glycaemic levels, subjective estimation of sensation in the feet and to perception of touch. Results Vibration thresholds were significantly higher in subjects with diabetes compared with healthy subjects at low frequencies (8, 16 and 32 Hz) at all measured sites, and also at 64 Hz for the metatarsal heads. Perception of touch and subjective estimation of sensation were significantly impaired in subjects with diabetes. Glycaemic levels, which were higher in subjects with diabetes, did not correlate with vibration thresholds at 32 Hz (most sensitive to Meissner?s corpuscles) or with touch thresholds in subjects with diabetes. Vibration thresholds at 32 Hz correlated significantly with perception of touch (rho = 0.45?0.65; P < 0.01) and with subjective sensation (rho = ?0.38 to ?0.52; P < 0.001) in subjects with diabetes. Perception of touch and subjective estimation of sensation did also correlate (rho = ?0.51 to ?0.80; P < 0.002). Conclusions Tactilometry is effective in detecting neuropathy in the sole of the foot at low frequencies of mainly 8?32 Hz, indicating that at least Meissner's corpuscles, or their related large nerve fibres, are affected by diabetes.

AB  - Abstract Mouse spinal cord (SC) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) provides important information on tissue morphology and structural changes that may occur during pathologies such as multiple sclerosis or SC injury. The acquisition scheme of the commonly used DWI techniques is based on conventional spin-echo encoding, which is time-consuming. The purpose of this work was to investigate whether the use of echo planar imaging (EPI) would provide good-quality diffusion MR images of mouse SC, as well as accurate measurements of diffusion-derived metrics, and thus enable diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and highly resolved DWI within reasonable scan times. A four-shot diffusion-weighted spin-echo EPI (SE-EPI) sequence was evaluated at 11.75?T on a group of healthy mice (n?=?10). SE-EPI-derived apparent diffusion coefficients of gray and white matter were compared with those obtained using a conventional spin-echo sequence (c-SE) to validate the accuracy of the method. To take advantage of the reduction in acquisition time offered by the EPI sequence, multi-slice DTI acquisitions were performed covering the cervical segments (six slices, six diffusion-encoding directions, three b values) within 30?min (vs 2?h for c-SE). From these measurements, fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivities were calculated, and fiber tracking along the C1 to C6 cervical segments was performed. In addition, high-resolution images (74???94?µm2) were acquired within 5?min per direction. Clear delineation of gray and white matter and identical apparent diffusion coefficient values were obtained, with a threefold reduction in acquisition time compared with c-SE. While overcoming the difficulties associated with high spatially and temporally resolved DTI measurements, the present SE-EPI approach permitted identification of reliable quantitative parameters with a reproducibility compatible with the detection of pathologies. The SE-EPI method may be particularly valuable when multiple sets of images from the SC are needed, in cases of rapidly evolving conditions, to decrease the duration of anesthesia or to improve MR exploration by including additional MR measurements.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare demographics and disease characteristics in dogs in which peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia (PPDH) had been diagnosed and report outcomes after surgical treatment (ST) or conservative treatment (CT). Study design Retrospective study. Sample population One hundred twenty-eight dogs (91 ST, 37 CT) in which PPDH had been diagnosed. Methods Medical records were reviewed for demographics, perioperative findings, and outcomes. Follow-up was obtained via telephone interview and email correspondence with owners and referring veterinarians. Baseline variables were compared between treatment groups. Results Dogs treated surgically were younger (P < .001), more likely to be sexually intact (P = .002), more likely to have clinical signs from PPDH vs an incidental diagnosis (P < .001), and more likely to have other congenital abnormalities (P = .003) compared with dogs treated conservatively. Ninety-seven percent of ST dogs were discharged from hospitals. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were reported in 22% and 41% of dogs, respectively, although most complications were classified as low grade (75% and 83%, respectively). Follow-up was available in 87 dogs, at a median of 1062?days. Hernia recurrence was not reported in any surgically treated dog. The deaths of nine dogs (five ST, four CT) could be attributed to PPDH, and long median survival times were observed in both the ST and CT groups (8.2 and 5?years, respectively). Conclusion Preoperative characteristics differed between dogs treated conservatively vs surgically. Surgical treatment was associated with low operative mortality, and both ST and CT dogs had good long-term survival. Clinical significance A diagnosis of PPDH can confer a good long-term prognosis for both ST and CT dogs.

AB  - Summary Induction of terpene synthase (TPS) gene expression and enzyme activity is known to occur in response to various chemical and biological stimuli in several species of spruce (genus Picea). However, high sequence identity between TPS family members has made it difficult to determine the induction patterns of individual TPS at the protein and transcript levels and whether specific TPS enzymes respond differentially to treatment. In the present study we used a multi-level approach to measure the induction and activity of TPS enzymes in protein extracts of Norway spruce (Picea abies) bark tissue following treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Measurements were made on the transcript, protein, enzyme activity and metabolite levels. Using a relatively new proteomics application, selective reaction monitoring (SRM), it was possible to differentiate and quantitatively measure the abundance of several known TPS proteins and three 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) isoforms in Norway spruce. Protein levels of individual TPS and DXS enzymes were differentially induced upon MeJA treatment and good correlation was generally observed between induction of transcripts, proteins, and enzyme activities. Most of the mono- and diterpenoid metabolites accumulated with similar temporal patterns of induction as part of the coordinated multi-compound chemical defense response. Protein and enzyme activity levels of the monoTPS (+)-3-carene synthase and the corresponding accumulation of (+)-3-carene was induced to a higher fold change than any other TPS or metabolite measured, indicating an important role in the induced terpenoid defense response in Norway spruce.

AB  - In order to provide data in support of licensure applications for citrate-phosphate-dextrose (CPD) supplemented with adenine, a multi-institutional cooperative effort was organized to determine survivability of red blood cells subjected to prolonged liquid storage. Two manufacturers supplied plastic multiple bag blood storage containers prefilled with modified CPD (glucose 25% greater than the normal concentration) supplemented with adenine (17.0 to 17.3 mg per 63 ml of anticoagulant; 0.25 millimolar approximate final concentration when diluted with 450 ml of whole blood). Red blood cells from 32 units stored as whole blood for 35 days showed a mean survival of 80.53 + 6.44 per cent (1 SD). Both red blood cell and supernatant plasma biochemical characteristics were comparable to those reported for whole blood stored for 21 days in either acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD) or CPD. Red blood cells from 19 units stored as concentrates for 35 days (Hct 75.03 + 3.74%) had a mean survival of 71.38 + 10.3 per cent with considerable interdonor variation in survival and interlaboratory variation in some biochemical characteristics. Red blood cells from eight units stored as concentrates (Hct 75.38 + 4.30%) for 28 days showed a mean survival of 83.97 + 6.10 per cent and biochemical characteristics comparable to those reported for red blood-cell concentrates stored in CPD or ACD for 21 days. Modified CPD with adenine as formulated offers an improved anticoagulant for blood banking by extending the permissible red blood cell storage period.

AB  - Abstract We consider a new concept of biometric-based cybersecurity systems for active authentication by continuous tracking, which utilizes biochemical processing of metabolites present in skin secretions. Skin secretions contain a large number of metabolites and small molecules that can be targeted for analysis. Here we argue that amino acids found in sweat can be exploited for the establishment of an amino acid profile capable of identifying an individual user of a mobile or wearable device. Individual and combinations of amino acids processed by biocatalytic cascades yield physical (optical or electronic) signals, providing a time-series of several outputs that, in their entirety, should suffice to authenticate a specific user based on standard statistical criteria. Initial results, motivated by biometrics, indicate that single amino acid levels can provide analog signals that vary according to the individual donor, albeit with limited resolution versus noise. However, some such assays offer digital separation (into well-defined ranges of values) according to groups such as age, biological sex, race, and physiological state of the individual. Multi-input biocatalytic cascades that handle several amino acid signals to yield a single digital-type output, as well as continuous-tracking time-series data rather than a single-instance sample, should enable active authentication at the level of an individual.

AB  - Abstract PSD-95 inhibitors have been shown to be neuroprotective in stroke, but have only to a very limited extent been evaluated in the treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that has pathophysiological mechanisms in common with stroke. The aims of the current study were to assess the effects of a novel dimeric inhibitor of PSD-95, UCCB01-147, on histopathology and long-term cognitive outcome after controlled cortical impact (CCI) in rats. As excitotoxic cell death is thought to be a prominent part of the pathophysiology of TBI, we also investigated the neuroprotective effects of UCCB01-147 and related compounds on NMDA-induced cell death in cultured cortical neurons. Anesthetized rats were given a CCI or sham injury, and were randomized to receive an injection of either UCCB01-147 (10 mg/kg), the non-competitive NMDAR-receptor antagonist MK-801 (1 mg/kg) or saline immediately after injury. At 2 and 4 weeks post-trauma, spatial learning and memory were assessed in a water maze, and at 3 months, brains were removed for estimation of lesion volumes. Overall, neither treatment with UCCB01-147 nor MK-801 resulted in significant improvements of cognition and histopathology after CCI. Although MK-801 provided robust neuroprotection against NMDA-induced toxicity in cultured cortical neurons, UCCB01-147 failed to reduce cell death and became neurotoxic at high doses. The data suggest potential differential effects of PSD-95 inhibition in stroke and TBI that should be investigated further in future studies taking important experimental factors such as timing of treatment, dosage, and anesthesia into consideration.

AB  - Polyurethane hydrogel foams synthesized through a facile one-pot, solvent-free process are described. The roles of polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecular weight, crosslinking density, and foam stabilizer concentration on polymer properties are evaluated for potential applications as wound dressing materials. Material characterization and wound dressing relevant performance evaluations are performed to understand effects of individual components and identify promising formulations. Surprisingly for a solvent-free reaction, complete polymerization is confirmed by IR and gel fraction analyses. Foam stabilizing agent loading increases mechanical properties including Young's modulus, extensibility, and toughness while decreasing pore size and drug release rate. Mechanical properties are also dependent on the crystalline melting temperature of the PEG diol. Utilizing caffeine as a drug surrogate, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) drug-release analysis identifies that polyurethane hydrogel foams exhibit initial burst release kinetics followed by sustained release over 24 h. Antibiotic compatibility and release is demonstrated for all formulations by zone of inhibition testing against gram-positive and negative bacteria.

AB  - Abstract Transplantable cell sheets containing osteoblasts were fabricated from periostea on temperature-responsive culture dishes. This study demonstrated the time-course of bone regeneration in living small animals. This continuous observation of bone regeneration was achieved by micro-computed tomography (µCT), which assessed the osteogenic capability of periosteal cells without biodegradable scaffolds. Real-time bone regeneration was non-invasively monitored in a rat calvarial bone defect model, using µCT. Three-dimensional (3D) images obtained over time by µCT clearly showed that two different bone regeneration modes, specific to the control and experimental groups, were observed. In the control group, bone was regenerated only from the periphery of the defect edges. In the experimental group, bone regeneration was observed in several small regions within the central portions of the defects that were covered by the transplanted cell sheets. However, bone regeneration observed after periosteal cell sheet transplantation was limited. The results of ALP staining and the time-course observations concluded that periosteal cell sheets contained a small fraction of cells that could differentiate osteoblasts. Fibroblasts in transplanted cell sheets or from around subcutaneous tissues suppressed bone regeneration. The periosteal cell sheets had a capability to produce ectopic regenerated bones. Therefore, to increase the content of osteogenic cells in harvested cell sheets, the enrichment of cells that could produce osteoblasts was expected by the modification of the initial cell preparation and the culture conditions. With further possible improvements, scaffold-free periosteal cell sheet fabricated on temperature-responsive culture dishes will be a valuable method for inducing and accelerating bone regeneration.

AB  - Wounding of Norway spruce by inoculation with sterile agar, or agar containing the pathogenic fungus Ceratocystis polonica, induced traumatic resin duct formation in the stem. Visible anatomical responses occurred in the cambium 6?9 d post-inoculation. Near the inoculation site cellular proliferation, polyphenolic accumulation, and lignification were induced as a wound reaction to seal the damaged area. Five centimetres from the inoculation site cells in the cambial zone swelled and divided to form clusters. By 18 d post-inoculation, these cells began to differentiate into resin duct epithelial cells surrounding incipient schizogenous lumens. Mature axial traumatic ducts appeared by 36 d as a row of ducts in the xylem centripetal to the cambium. The ducts formed an interconnected network continuous with radial resin ducts. Parenchyma cells surrounding the ducts accumulated polyphenols that disappeared as the cells differentiated into tracheids. These polyphenols appeared to contain fewer sugar residues compared to those accumulating in the secondary phloem, as indicated by the periodic acid?Schiff's staining. The epithelial cells did not accumulate polyphenols but contained immunologically detectable phenylalanine ammonia lyase (EC 4.3.1.5), indicating synthesis of phenolics as a possible resin component. These findings may represent a defense mechanism in Norway spruce against the pathogenic fungus Ceratocystis polonica.

AB  - Abstract Objective.? Occipital neuralgia (ON) is a challenging condition for which there is no reference standard for treatment. The purpose of this study was to provide outcome data on the largest study to date evaluating pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) for ON and to determine whether any demographic, clinical, or treatment characteristics are associated with success. Design.? Retrospective data analysis was conducted in 102 subjects evaluating the effect of myriad factors on treatment success. Setting.? This study was conducted in academic civilian and military pain treatment centers. Patients.? One hundred and two consecutive patients with a primary diagnosis of ON were treated with PRF of the greater and/or lesser occipital nerve. Outcome Measures.? A positive primary outcome was predefined as ≥50% pain relief lasting at least 3 months. The secondary outcome measure was procedural satisfaction. Results.? Fifty-two (51%) patients experienced ≥50% pain relief and satisfaction with treatment lasting at least 3 months. Variables associated with a positive outcome included a traumatic inciting event (65.7% success rate; P?=?0.03), lower diagnostic block volumes (odds ratio [OR]: 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62?0.82; P?<?0.0001), and employment of multiple rounds of PRF (OR: 2.95; 95% CI: 1.77?4.92; P?<?0.0001). Factors correlating with treatment failure included extension of pain anterior to the scalp apex (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.14?0.73; P?=?0.006) and ongoing secondary gain issues (OR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.11?0.33; P?<?0.0001). Conclusion.? PRF may provide intermediate-term benefit in ON to a significant proportion of refractory cases. Careful attention to selection criteria and treatment parameters may further improve treatment outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Background The purpose of this study was to characterize hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated differences in the expression of 47 inflammatory factors and to evaluate the potential role of peripheral immune activation in HCV-associated neuropsychiatric symptoms?depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain. An additional objective was to evaluate the role of immune factor dysregulation in the expression of specific neuropsychiatric symptoms to identify biomarkers that may be relevant to the treatment of these neuropsychiatric symptoms in adults with or without HCV. Methods Blood samples and neuropsychiatric symptom severity scales were collected from HCV-infected adults (HCV+, n = 39) and demographically similar noninfected controls (HCV?, n = 40). Multi-analyte profile analysis was used to evaluate plasma biomarkers. Results Compared with HCV? controls, HCV+ adults reported significantly (P < 0.050) greater depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain, and they were more likely to present with an increased inflammatory profile as indicated by significantly higher plasma levels of 40% (19/47) of the factors assessed (21%, after correcting for multiple comparisons). Within the HCV+ group, but not within the HCV? group, an increased inflammatory profile (indicated by the number of immune factors > the LDC) significantly correlated with depression, anxiety, and pain. Within the total sample, neuropsychiatric symptom severity was significantly predicted by protein signatures consisting of 4?10 plasma immune factors; protein signatures significantly accounted for 19?40% of the variance in depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain. Conclusions Overall, the results demonstrate that altered expression of a network of plasma immune factors contributes to neuropsychiatric symptom severity. These findings offer new biomarkers to potentially facilitate pharmacotherapeutic development and to increase our understanding of the molecular pathways associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in adults with or without HCV.

AB  - ABSTRACT Subluxation of a vertebra secondary to an injury (ie, traumatic spondyloptosis) is most commonly seen in the lumbosacral joint. This extremely rare spinal destabilization is caused by congenital defects, degeneration, tumors, infection, or trauma and is accompanied by severe neurologic debilitation. The patient's neurological function can be preserved when surgical team members have knowledge of spinal injuries, surgical interventions, positioning and its implications, and an awareness of the risks to the patient. Appropriate interventions can decrease complications, operative revisions, length of stay, morbidity and mortality, and hospital costs. AORN J 89 (April 2009) 657?672. ? AORN, Inc, 2009.

AB  - Summary Fusarium circinatum causes pitch canker disease in a wide range of pine trees, including Pinus radiata, with devastating economic consequences. To assess the spatial and temporal dynamics of growth of this pathogen in radiata pine, we examined the process of infection using both real-time PCR to quantify fungal biomass inside the plant host, and confocal microscopy using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged strain of F. circinatum. Pathogen growth exhibited three distinct phases: an initial exponential increase in fungal biomass, concomitant with pathogen colonization of the cortex and phloem; a slowdown in fungal growth coincident with sporulating hyphae deep within the host; and stabilization of the fungal biomass when the first wilting symptoms appeared. The number of resin ducts in the xylem was found to increase in response to infection and the fungus grew inside both constitutive and traumatic resin ducts. These results indicate that conidiation may contribute to the spatial or temporal dissemination of the pathogen. Moreover, the present findings raise the intriguing possibility that the generation of traumatic resin ducts may be of more benefit to the fungus than to the plant.

AB  - Abstract The allotransplantation of vascularized femoral diaphyses and total knee joints is a novel approach in orthopedic surgery. Allogeneic femoral diaphyses were transplanted into three patients suffering from chondrosarcoma or posttraumatic defects. Total knee joints allografts were transplanted in five patients with large bone defects of the knee and loss of the extensor apparatus caused either by major trauma alone or infection after a major trauma. Bone segments and total joints were harvested from multi-organ donors, perfused with UW-solution and transplanted within cold ischemia times of 18?25 h. Patients were immunosuppressed postoperatively primarily with cyclosporine (Cyclosporin A) and azathioprine. Two allografts (1 femur, 1 knee) were lost due to infections. Seven of the eight patients are able to walk with full weight-bearing posttransplant. Two of the patients with transplanted joint allografts subsequently received total knee arthroplasty implantations. Vascularized bone and joint allotransplantation may serve as a last line of defense treatment before considering lower limb amputation. ? 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Microsurgery 20:375?383 2000

AB  - Abstract Objective ED chest pain assessments can be challenging, lengthy and contribute to overcrowding. Rapid accurate risk stratification strategies should improve ED length of stay (EDLOS). Emergency, Biochemistry and Cardiology implemented new guidelines using paired (<3?h) multiple cardiac markers to stratify patients. The intervention would reduce chest pain EDLOS. We observed for safety and disposition effects. Methods This is a single-site, prospective observational, before and after intervention study. In December 2009, paired multiple cardiac markers, the second at least 4?h from pain, replaced late troponins. The 4 h rule (ED flow improvement) started in April 2009 (unplanned confounder). Demographics, clinical features, risk assessment and disposition; preferably prospective. Administrative datasets provided disposition outcomes, 4 months pre-/post-intervention. Follow up with partially blinded adjudications assessed for 45?day major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Before intervention, consecutive patients were enrolled with mixed prospective/retrospective data. After, sampling occurred whenever prospective data were collected. Results Adjudicated patients were n?=?1029 (14.2% MI, 14.9% MACE), 426 before, 603 after. EDLOS reduced 87?min (416?329; P?<?0.001), similar to triage 2 patients without chest pain. Possibly, avoidable MACE occurred in five of 598 discharges (0.8%, CI 0.3?1.8%) with non-significant decreases (0.5%, CI 0.1?1.8%) post-intervention. Disposition changes included greater observation ward use (3.8?12.3%; P?<?0.001), more discharges (47.4?52.9%, P?=?0.002), less transfers (9.3?6.9%, P?=?0.014) and less late inpatient discharge decisions (15.2?8.7%, P?=?0.001). Conclusion Paired cardiac markers performed adequately for avoidable MACE, and disposition improved significantly. A confounding system change meant the reduced EDLOS (primary outcome) was unable to be associated with the intervention.

AB  - Amongst all dental traumas in the permanent dentition, crown fractures account for the largest majority. This review paper will discuss the different levels of fracture, from the most superficial ones only affecting the enamel to the deepest ones with pulp exposure, including crown?root fractures. It will focus on the pulp by evaluating the pulp response to trauma and to the subsequent treatment. An attempt to correlate epidemiological, experimental, histopathological, and clinical studies will be made, so that the clinician can better understand the underlying processes which evolve towards pulp healing or pulp necrosis, thus success or failure. If handled properly, prognosis of the pulp following a traumatic crown fracture is good. In the permanent dentition, success rate ranges between 72% and 100%, the highest success rate corresponding to superficial fractures and the lowest success rate to fractures with pulp exposure.

AB  - Abstract Advanced therapies such as bioengineered skin substitutes (BSS) and dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (dHACM) have been shown to promote healing of chronic diabetic ulcers. An interim analysis of data from 60 patients enrolled in a prospective, randomised, controlled, parallel group, multi-centre clinical trial showed that dHACM (EpiFix?, MiMedx Group Inc., Marietta, GA) is superior to standard wound care (SWC) and BSS (Apligraf?, Organogenesis, Inc., Canton, MA) in achieving complete wound closure within 4?6 weeks. Rates and time to closure at a longer time interval and factors influencing outcomes remained unassessed; therefore, the study was continued in order to achieve at least 100 patients. With the larger cohort, we compare clinical outcomes at 12 weeks in 100 patients with chronic lower extremity diabetic ulcers treated with weekly applications of Apligraf (n = 33), EpiFix (n = 32) or SWC (n = 35) with collagen-alginate dressing as controls. A Cox regression was performed to analyse the time to heal within 12 weeks, adjusting for all significant covariates. A Kaplan?Meier analysis was conducted to compare time-to-heal within 12 weeks for the three treatment groups. Clinical characteristics were well matched across study groups. The proportion of wounds achieving complete closure within the 12-week study period were 73% (24/33), 97% (31/32), and 51% (18/35) for Apligraf, EpiFix and SWC, respectively (adjusted P = 0·00019). Subjects treated with EpiFix had a very significant higher probability of their wounds healing [hazard ratio (HR: 5·66; adjusted P: 1·3 x 10?7] compared to SWC alone. No difference in probability of healing was observed for the Apligraf and SWC groups. Patients treated with Apligraf were less likely to heal than those treated with EpiFix [HR: 0·30; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0·17?0·54; unadjusted P: 5·8 x 10?5]. Increased wound size and presence of hypertension were significant factors that influenced healing. Mean time-to-heal within 12 weeks was 47·9 days (95% CI: 38·2?57·7) with Apligraf, 23·6 days (95% CI: 17·0?30·2) with EpiFix group and 57·4 days (95%CI: 48·2?66·6) with the SWC alone group (adjusted P = 3·2 x 10?7). Median number of grafts used per healed wound were six (range 1?13) and 2·5 (range 1?12) for the Apligraf and EpiFix groups, respectively. Median graft cost was $8918 (range $1,486?19,323) per healed wound for the Apligraf group and $1,517 (range $434?25,710) per healed wound in the EpiFix group (P?<?0·0001). These results provide further evidence of the clinical and resource utilisation superiority of EpiFix compared to Apligraf for the treatment of lower extremity diabetic wounds.
