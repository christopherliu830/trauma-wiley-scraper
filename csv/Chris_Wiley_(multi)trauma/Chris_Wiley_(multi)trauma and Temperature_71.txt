AB  - Does early intervention with a light mobilization program reduce long-term sick leave for low back pain? (Central Hospital in Hedmark, Ottestad, Norway) Spine 2000;25:1973?1976. This randomized, controlled clinical trial investigated the effect of a light mobilization program on the duration of sick leave for patients with subacute low back pain. Early intervention with information, diagnostics, and light mobilization may be a cost-effective method for returning patients quickly to normal activity. In this experiment, patients were referred to a low back pain clinic and given a simple and systematic program as an outpatient treatment. Patients sick-listed 8 to 12 weeks (N = 457) for low back pain were randomized into two groups: an intervention group (n = 237) and a control group (n = 220). The intervention group was examined at a spine clinic and given information and advice to stay active. The control group was not examined at the clinic, but was treated with conventional primary health care. At 12-month follow-up assessment, 68.4% in the intervention group had returned to full-duty work, as compared with 56.4% in the control group. Conclude that early intervention with examination, information, and recommendations to stay active showed significant effects in reducing sick leave for patients with low back pain. Comment by Susan Anderson, MD. This is a randomized controlled clinical trial to compare patients that have been sick listed for more than 8 weeks in Norway. Comparison was between a control group that received conventional primary health care and an intervention group that was examined at a spine clinic, given information, and advised to stay active. The authors wanted to examine if an early intervention with information, diagnostics, and light mobilization may be a cost-effective method for returning patients quickly to normal activity. This study involved 457 patients that were sick listed 8 to 12 weeks for low back pain. The inclusion criteria for the study was based on 1) 8 to 12 weeks being ?sick-listed,? 2) age (18 to 60 years), and 3) diagnosis that included back pain, low back pain, leg and thigh pain, back pain without sciatica, and sciatica. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, recent low back trauma, cauda equina symptoms, cancer, osteoporosis, rheumatic low back disease, and ongoing low back treatment. The intervention used was modification of Indahl's light mobilization program where the patient was referred to a spine clinic, answered standard questionnaires, and was interviewed and examined by a treatment team consisting of a physician and a physiotherapist. Any somatic findings during the examination were explained to the patient and information was given about their importance. All radiographs were shown and explained. The idea was to educate the patient and dedramatize their problems. The patient was assured of a good prognosis and informed of the importance of remaining active to avoid development of muscle dysfunction. The physiotherapist individually advises the patient on how to train and stretch at home. They were also advised on how to manage the back pain and resume normal activity. The patients in the control group were not examined at the clinic, but were treated with primary health care, which included at least one visit to a general practitioner. The patients were reassessed at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. The assessment was to determine if the patient had returned to full duty work. At each of the assessments, the intervention group had a higher percentage of patients that had returned to full duty work. At the 12-month follow-up, 68.4% in the intervention group had returned to full duty work as compared with 56.4% in a controlled group. This study demonstrates that a consultation with thorough examination, information, reassurance, and encouragement shows a significant effect in reducing sick leave for patients with low back pain as compared to the conventional health care guidelines used by general practitioners that tend to recommend bed rest, caution, and reduced activities. The authors suggest that information and fear reduction when offered systematically may reduce the fear of ?doing something wrong? to the back. This may then prevent unnecessary activity and long sick leave.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To determine the impact of acepromazine on the cardiovascular responses to three treatments for hypotension in dogs during deep isoflurane anesthesia. Study design? Prospective blinded randomized cross-over experimental design. Animals? Six adult (2.5?±?0.5?year old) healthy mixed breed dogs (24.2?±?7.6?kg). Methods? Anesthesia was induced with propofol (4?6?mg?kg?1, IV) and maintained with isoflurane. Each dog received six treatments separated by at least 5?days. Once instrumented, dogs randomly received acepromazine (0.05?mg?kg?1) (Ace) or saline (equal volume) (Sal) IV and end-tidal isoflurane (E?Iso) was adjusted to achieve hypotension, defined as a mean blood pressure between 45 and 50?mmHg. Dogs randomly received dextran (D) (7?mL?kg?1) or lactated Ringer?s (LR) (20?mL?kg?1) over 14?minutes, or ephedrine (Eph) (0.1?mg?kg?1 followed by 10??g?kg?1?minute?1) throughout the study. Measurements were taken at baseline, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40?minutes. Data were analyzed with a Latin Square in two factors (Ace/Sal and treatment) for repeated measures, with further comparisons if appropriate (p?<?0.05). Results? E?Iso producing hypotension was significantly less following Ace (2.07?±?0.23%) than Sal (2.43?±?0.23%). No improvement in cardiac output (CO) was observed with D or LR. LR initially intensified hypotension with a significant reduction in SVR, while D caused a minor improvement in ABP. Eph produced a significant increase in ABP, CO, hemoglobin, oxygen content and delivery. Pre-treatment with Ace minimized ABP improvements with all treatments. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Acepromazine (0.05?mg?kg?1 IV) enhanced the hypotensive effect of isoflurane, although it maintained CO. Administration of LR significantly worsens ABP initially by further vasodilation. D caused minimal improvement in ABP. At the infusion studied, Eph effectively countered the cardiovascular depression produced by deep isoflurane anesthesia, but extremes in ABP associated with initial vasoconstriction prevent our recommendation at this dose.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To describe alfaxalone total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) following premedication with buprenorphine and either acepromazine (ACP) or dexmedetomidine (DEX) in bitches undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Study?design? Prospective, randomised, clinical study. Animals? Thirty-eight healthy female dogs. Methods? Following intramuscular buprenorphine (20??g?kg?1) and acepromazine (0.05?mg?kg?1) or dexmedetomidine (approximately 10??g?kg?1, adjusted for body surface area), anaesthesia was induced and maintained with intravenous alfaxalone. Oxygen was administered via a suitable anaesthetic circuit. Alfaxalone infusion rate (initially 0.07?mg?kg?1?minute?1) was adjusted to maintain adequate anaesthetic depth based on clinical assessment. Alfaxalone boluses were given if required. Ventilation was assisted if necessary. Alfaxalone dose and physiologic parameters were recorded every 5 minutes. Depth of sedation after premedication, induction quality and recovery duration and quality were scored. A Student?s t-test, Mann?Whitney U and Chi-squared tests determined the significance of differences between groups. Data are presented as mean?±?SD or median (range). Significance was defined as p?<?0.05. Results? There were no differences between groups in demographics; induction quality; induction (1.5?±?0.57?mg?kg?1) and total bolus doses [1.2 (0???6.3)?mg?kg?1] of alfaxalone; anaesthesia duration (131?±?18?minutes); or time to extubation [16.6 (3?50) minutes]. DEX dogs were more sedated than ACP dogs. Alfaxalone infusion rate was significantly lower in DEX [0.08 (0.06?0.19)?mg kg?1?minute?1] than ACP dogs [0.11 (0.07?0.33)?mg kg?1?minute?1]. Cardiovascular variables increased significantly during ovarian and cervical ligation and wound closure compared to baseline values in both groups. Apnoea and hypoventilation were common and not significantly different between groups. Arterial haemoglobin oxygen saturation remained above 95% in all animals. Recovery quality scores were significantly poorer for DEX than for ACP dogs. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Alfaxalone TIVA is an effective anaesthetic for surgical procedures but, in the protocol of this study, causes respiratory depression at infusion rates required for surgery.

AB  - Abstract A thin polymeric film, containing a basic polyelectrolyte, was developed with properties that potentially make it highly suitable for use in a membrane blood oxygenator. Its CO2 absorption capacity was correlated as a function of the CO2 partial pressure, temperature and relative humidity of the processed gas. The correlation showed a linear dependence with CO2 partial pressure and relative humidity and an Arrhenius dependence with temperature. A four-step mechanism for the absorption process was postulated and its parameters were evalutaed. The apparent diffusion constant for CO2 was five times that measured for an ion-exchange resin made from the polyelectrolyte. The capacity and mechanism correlations obtained are suitable for the design of a CO2 removal unit for a recirculated air atmosphere as well as for a blood oxygenator. The permeability of the film to CO2 and O2 was measured and the ratio was found to be far greater than that of most commercial materials. This suggests that a blood oxygenator utilizing such a film would have the controlling resistance to transfer on the oxygen side, rather than on the blood side, thus perhaps avoiding bubbling on the blood side altogether.

AB  - Abstract Background Skin tissue dielectric constant (TDC) measurements at a frequency of 300 MHz are used to assess skin properties in many conditions. Impacts of patient obesity on these values are unknown, and its quantitative assessment was the goal of this research. Materials and Methods Women in a weight loss program (N = 32) had TDC measured on forearm, biceps, neck, jowl, and submental regions along with measurements of total body fat (TBF), water (TBW), intracellular water (ICW), and extracellular water (ECW) via multi-frequency bioimpedance. Group age (mean ± SD) was 40.0 ± 11.6 years (20-70 years) with body mass index (BMI) of 31.8 ± 6.7 Kg/m2 (23.0-49.9 Kg/m2). For analysis, subjects were divided into those with BMI < 30 Kg/m2 (subgroup A, n = 16) vs ≥30 Kg/m2 (subgroup B, n = 16). Results Tissue dielectric constant at forearm and biceps decreased significantly (P < .001) with increasing depth from 0.5 to 1.5 to 2.5 mm but TDC values and their inter-side ratios did not differ between subgroups A and B at any measured site. Although correlations between TBW, ECW, and ICW were significant (P < .001), there was no dependence of TDC values on any of these parameters. Conclusions Previously unknown TDC values for obese persons are provided and based on subgroup analyses suggest that skin TDC values in overweight and obese persons are not confounded by variables such as TBW and TBF. Further, since inter-side ratios and their SD?s yielded thresholds for forearm and biceps similar to those established for women with normal BMI, use of these clinical inter-arm TDC ratios now is extended to include a wider BMI range.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objective Carbon dioxide (CO2) laser skin resurfacing has become an accepted procedure for the rejuvenation of aged and wrinkled facial skin. The benefits of this technique have been limited by the prolonged postoperative erythema, delayed re-epithelialization, and potential changes in pigmentation. We investigated the effects of coupling a pulsed CO2 laser to a zinc selenide handpiece at various temperatures to cool and conduct heat from the skin surface. We compared the heat conducting handpiece to standard techniques used to determine the effects on epithelial preservation, depth of thermal damage, and new collagen growth. Study Design/Materials and Methods The dorsal aspect of piglets was treated with four handpiece arrangements: no thermally conducting window; a zinc selenide thermally conducting window at room temperature; and the zinc selenide thermally conducting window cooled to 10 and 5°C. Intensities were measured to account for reflections from the surface of the handpiece. With the CO2 laser in scanning mode and a spot size of 1 mm, each handpiece was used at intensities ranging from 8?30 W in one pass. Biopsies for histopathologic analysis and determination of the degree of epithelial damage and the depth of thermal damage were taken on days 0, 2, and 16. Results All specimens revealed complete re-epithelialization by day 16. The addition of a cooled handpiece did not affect either the amount of epithelial preservation or the depth of thermal damage. Conclusions There is no significant advantage in using a cooled or room temperature zinc selenide handpiece for epithelial preservation or decreasing the inflammatory response in CO2 laser resurfacing.

AB  - This is the second annual revision of the Geriatrics Bibliography. Approximately two thirds of the old references have been replaced by more current or more detailed articles. The bibliography has been expanded to include several additional topics and over 200 new references. Since the literature pertinent to geriatrics is growing ever more rapidly, it has been necessary to omit many informative articles from the bibliography. Almost all of the references date from the past four years. Preference is given to recent publications, since they provide a list of the important earlier articles. Some articles were selected to highlight current controversies or changes in viewpoint. An occasional review article is cited to amplify geriatric aspects of common diseases. Most of the references deal specifically with an elderly patient population, studies of which, it will be noted, are confounded by questions of ?normal? aging as opposed to the concomitants of aging frequent in our society: inactivity, obesity, malnutrition, and psychosocial trauma. A few articles concern diseases remarkably common in the aged but for which no adequate study specifically from a geriatric viewpoint exists; e.g., monoclonal gammopathy, Paget's disease, pulmonary emboli. The references are divided into categories. The first (I) set deals with some possible causes of aging, the second (II) with physiologic decline accompanying aging, the third (III) with the atypical and nonspecific characteristics of illness among geriatric patients, and the fourth (IV) with non-physician services available to the elderly, including ethical quandaries. The remainder of the references are cited by pertinent medical specialty. Within each category, references are divided by disease process. Articles are further subgrouped by aspects of those diseases such as evaluation or therapy.

AB  - Inconsistencies and inadequacies in both the approach to post-mortem examination of the heart and the subsequent reporting of findings have been blamed for a lack of progression of understanding about great ape cardiovascular disease. In order to minimize and confront these issues in the United States, Association of Zoos and Aquariums-member zoos have necropsy data collated by the Great Ape Heart Project using a protocol developed by their pathology advisors. In Europe, however, there does not appear to be in existence any standardization or process for consistent cardiac post-mortem examination, data collection and/or relevant research. This article provides those readers working within/for European collections with a suggested protocol for the initial post-mortem inspection and sampling of the hearts of great apes. This article also outlines the detailed macroscopic and histopathologic examination that is currently carried out at The University of Nottingham, UK, as part of an ongoing prospective, multi-centre study into great ape cardiovascular disease aetiopathogenesis. Finally, readers are offered guidance on the reporting and description specifically of idiopathic myocardial fibrosis (also referred to elsewhere as fibrosing cardiomyopathy). The standardized post-mortem examination of the great ape heart across European zoological collections will ensure a more uniform sampling procedure resulting in the availability of consistent good-quality data. It is hoped that this will, in turn, inform diagnostic pathology and research in this area, and enhance understanding about the aetiopathogenesis of great ape cardiovascular lesions.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To investigate the impact of a change in body position on blood gases and arterial blood pressures in foals anesthetized with guaifenesin, ketamine, and xylazine. Study design? Prospective, randomized experimental study. Animals? Twelve Quarter Horse foals, age of 5.4?±0.9?months and weighing 222?±?48?kg. Methods? Foals were anesthetized with guaifenesin, ketamine, and xylazine for 40?minutes in lateral recumbency and then assigned to a change in lateral recumbency after hoisting (Group 1, n?=?6), or no change (Group 2, n?=?6). Oxygen 15?L?minute?1 was insufflated into the endotracheal tube throughout anesthesia. Arterial blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate (fR), inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2), and end-tidal carbon dioxide (Pe?CO2) were measured every 5?minutes. Arterial pH and blood gases [arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2)] were measured at 10, 30, and 40?minutes after induction, and 5?minutes after hoisting. Alveolar dead space ventilation and PaO2/FiO2 were calculated. Two repeated measures models were used. All hypothesis tests were two-sided and significance level was α?=?0.05. All values are presented as least square means?±?SE. Results? Values at time-matched points from the two groups were not significantly different so they were combined. Arterial partial pressure of oxygen decreased significantly from 149?±?14.4?mmHg before hoisting to 92?±?11.6?mmHg after hoisting (p?=?0.0013). The PaO2/FiO2 ratio decreased from 275?±?30 to 175?±?24 (p?=?0.0055). End-tidal carbon dioxide decreased significantly from 48.7?±?1.6 to 44.5?±?1.2?mmHg (p?=?0.021). Arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, blood pressures and heart rates measured 5?minutes after hoisting were not different from measurements obtained before hoisting. Conclusion and clinical relevance? Hoisting decreased PaO2 in anesthetized healthy foals. Administration of supplemental oxygen is recommended to counter the decrease in oxygenation and PaO2 measurement is necessary to detect early changes.

AB  - Aim: Multi-center clinical trials were performed using allogeneic cultured dermal substitutes (CDS) newly developed in the R & D Center for Artificial Skin of Kitasato University. Method: This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of CDS for the treatment of burns in 5 cases and the treatment of skin ulcers in 4 cases. Complications with the skin ulcers were diabetes (1 case), varix (1 case), and collagen diseases (2 cases). The wound surface area was measured with picture analysis software during the wound healing process. Results: The clinical evaluation was made using a protocol that includes a standard for the development of new wound dressings. According to the comprehensive judgment, the results achieved were evaluated as excellent for 4 burn cases and good for one case. Regarding the skin ulcers, results were excellent in 3 cases and good for one case. No harmful complications were observed during this study. Conclusions: CDS were useful for burn and ulcer treatment but the wound surface must be checked rigorously for the occurrence of infection during the healing process.

AB  - Objectives To describe the use, effectiveness and tolerance of high-flow oxygen therapy in dyspnoeic dogs. Materials and Methods Prospectively, dogs in acute respiratory distress admitted to an intensive care unit between January and May 2018 that failed to respond to nasal oxygen therapy and medical stabilisation after 30?minutes were transitioned to high-flow oxygen therapy. High-flow oxygen therapy, delivered an inspired oxygen fraction of 100% using an air/oxygen blender, active humidifier, single warmed tube and specific nasal cannula. Respiratory rate, pulse oximetry (SpO2), heart rate and a tolerance score were assessed every 15?minutes from T0 (under nasal oxygen) to 1 hour (T60), and PaO2 and PaCO2 at T0 and T60. Complications were recorded for each dog. Results Eleven dogs were included. At T60, PaO2, flow rate and SpO2 were significantly greater than at T0 (171?±?123 versus 73?±?24?mmHg; P=0.015; 18?±12?L/minute versus 3.2?±?2.0 L/minute, P<0.01; 97.7?±2.3% versus 91.6?±7.2%, P=0.03, respectively). There was no significant difference in PaCO2, respiratory rate or heart rate between T0 and T60. Tolerance was excellent, and there were no complications. Clinical Significance High-flow oxygen therapy improves markers of oxygenation in dyspnoeic dogs and is an effective means to deliver oxygen with comfort and minimal complications.

AB  - Summary Largely based on the fact that administration of purified lipopolysaccharide induces many of the signs of circulatory insufficiency that occur in horses with a variety of gastrointestinal diseases, these signs have been linked with the term endotoxemia. However, differences between experimentally induced endotoxemia and the clinical syndrome of endotoxemia have been recognized by veterinary clinicians. A similar situation exists in human medicine where the term ?systemic inflammatory response syndrome? (SIRS) was coined for the clinical responses of human patients to nonspecific insults (i.e., in the absence of a documented infection). Our current knowledge regarding the systemic inflammatory response to bacterial ligands provides the basis for reconsidering the widespread usage of the term endotoxemia in equine clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare the effects of two fractions of inspired oxygen (FiO2) (0.4 and 1) on lung aeration and gas exchange during general anaesthesia in cats. Study design? Randomized, blinded, controlled study. Animals? Thirty healthy, mixed breed, client owned female cats. Materials and methods? Cats were premedicated intramuscularly with acepromazine (0.03?mg?kg?1) and medetomidine (0.015?mg?kg?1). Anaesthesia was induced with propofol (5?mg?kg?1) and, after orotracheal intubation, maintained with isoflurane carried by either 100% oxygen (G100, n?=?15) or an oxygen-air mixture with 40% oxygen (G40, n?=?15). All cats were placed in dorsal recumbency and breathed spontaneously throughout the entire procedure. Following surgery (ovariectomy), a spiral computed tomography (CT) of the thorax was performed, arterial oxygen (PaO2) and carbon dioxide (PaCO2) tensions were measured and alveolar?arterial gradient of oxygen [P(A?a)O2] calculated. The CT images were analysed for lung aeration by the analysis of radiograph attenuations (Hounsfield units, HU), according to the following classification: hyperinflated area (?1000 to ?900 HU), normally aerated area (?900 to ?500?HU), poorly aerated area (?500 to ?100?HU) and non-aerated area (?100 to +100?HU). The groups were compared using one-way anova. Results? Compared to G100, the normally-aerated lung area was significantly greater and the poorly-aerated and non-aerated areas were significantly smaller in G40. PaCO2 was similar in both groups. PaO2 and P(A?a)O2 were significantly higher in G100. In both groups, pulmonary atelectasis developed preferentially in the caudal lung fields. Conclusion? In cats anaesthetised with isoflurane, the administration of an FiO2 of >0.9 significantly impaired lung aeration and gas exchange as compared to an FiO2 of 0.4. Clinical relevance? An FiO2 of 0.4 may better preserve lung aeration and gas exchange in anaesthetised spontaneously breathing cats but monitoring is essential to ensure oxygenation is adequate.

AB  - Summary. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to study the localization of platelet factor 4 (PF4), fibronectin (Fn) and factor VIII related antigen in washed normal platelets and those from patients with severe von Willebrand's disease (vWd). Platelets were prepared by an improved multi-unit modification of the Sayk chamber. This facilitated the preparation of samples with minimum disruption of platelets and readily permitted the demonstration of intact platelet granules by the immunological techniques used. The antigens were demonstrated by treating the same preparations sequentially with appropriate heterologous antisera and species specific fluorescein or rhodamine conjugated antisera. Comparison of the different antigens in identical platelets indicated that Fn and VIIIR:Ag were localized to the same granules as PF4 and the results were thus consistent with their presence in alpha granules. Fn and PF4, but not VIIIR:Ag, were present in platelet granules of patients with severe vWd. The antigens were always detected in the same granules, and major sub-populations of differently stained granules were not observed. The methods were applied to investigate normal platelets aggregated with collagen. Fn and VIIIR:Ag were detected in platelet granules after aggregation although the granules themselves were possibly differently distributed in these samples compared with the non-aggregated platelets. The localization of PF4 could not be reliably assessed in aggregated platelets by these methods. The techniques may be useful in localizing platelet antigens and studying release during aggregation.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To assess the effect of morphine on the bispectral index (BIS) in dogs during isoflurane anesthesia maintained at a constant end-tidal concentration. Study design? Prospective, randomized, experimental trial. Animals? Eight adult Beagle dogs, weighing between 7.1 and 9.8?kg. Methods? Anesthesia was induced with isoflurane via a face mask. Dog?s tracheas were intubated and anesthesia maintained with isoflurane at a constant end-tidal concentration (e?Iso) of 1.81% for a 30-minute equilibration period. Pulmonary ventilation was controlled to normocapnia. After equilibration, baseline values were recorded prior to intravenous administration of morphine sulfate (0.5?mg?kg?1) (MT) or an equal volume of saline (CT). Measurements for heart rate, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure (SAP, DAP and MAP) were recorded at 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 and 120?minutes after treatment. Bispectral index was recorded every 10?seconds for 3?minutes for each time measurement. Venous blood samples were collected at baseline, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60 and 120?minutes for determination of morphine serum concentrations. Anesthesia was discontinued after the last measurement and dogs were allowed to recover. Results? Baseline BIS for MT and CT at 1.81%e?Iso were 63?±?10 and 58?±?9, respectively. Bispectral index in MT was 4?8% lower at 20, 75, 90 and 105?minutes compared with CT. There were no differences in BIS between baseline and any subsequent measurement within either MT or CT. Heart rate, SAP, MAP, and DAP decreased after morphine administration. Conclusion and clinical relevance? Intravenous administration of 0.5?mg?kg?1 morphine sulfate did not cause clinically significant changes in the BIS of unstimulated dogs during isoflurane anesthesia at an e?Iso of 1.81%.

AB  - Abstract Foot infections are common in persons with diabetes and are often the proximate cause of lower extremity amputation. There have been many publications in the past few years dealing with the appropriate ways to diagnose and treat diabetic foot infections. This review presents information gathered from a comprehensive, ongoing surveillance of the literature (published and abstracts) over the past 4 years. Prospective studies have now defined the epidemiology of diabetic foot infections, as well as methods to score and classify the wounds. Several recently published guidelines can assist clinicians in managing these infections. The etiologic agents of infection have been well-defined, and the prevalence of multi-drug-resistance pathogens is growing. Molecular methods offer great promise for quicker and more sensitive diagnosis of infection. New antimicrobial agents, both systemic and topical, as well as novel local treatments, have been shown to be effective in various studies. Improved methods of deploying older agents have added to the variety of treatment approaches now available. Several adjunctive treatments may benefit some patients but their role is as yet unclear. While there is much yet to learn about the most cost-effective ways to diagnose and treat diabetic foot infections the main effort is now to disseminate the available information and facilitate employing the evidence-based guideline recommendations.

AB  - Recent advances in diffusion MRI employ multiple diffusion encoding schemes with varying diffusion direction, weighting, and diffusion time to investigate specific microstructural properties in biological tissues. In this study, we examined time-dependent diffusion kurtosis contrast in adult mouse brains and in neonatal mouse brains after hypoxic?ischemic (HI) injury. In vivo diffusion kurtosis maps were acquired with a short diffusion time using an oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) sequence at 100 Hz and with a relatively long diffusion time (20 ms) using a pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) sequence. In the adult mouse brain, we found that the cortex and hippocampus showed larger differences between OGSE kurtosis and PGSE kurtosis than major white matter tracts. In neonatal mouse brains with unilateral HI injury, the OGSE kurtosis map overall provided stronger edema contrast than the PGSE kurtosis map, and the differences between OGSE and PGSE kurtosis measurements in the edema region reflected heterogeneity of injury. This is the first in vivo study that has demonstrated multi-direction OGSE kurtosis contrasts in the mouse brain. Comparing PGSE and OGSE kurtosis measures may provide additional information on microstructural changes after ischemic stroke.

AB  - Objective To describe a reverse axial pattern flap based on the superficial branch of the dorsal penile artery and describe its use in preputial reconstruction. Materials and Methods Ten penises were harvested from canine cadavers; five were used to describe the dermatome supplied by the superficial branch of the dorsal artery of the penis and five to show perfusion of the skin flap. The superficial branch of the dorsal artery of the penis was identified fluoroscopically by injecting contrast material into the dorsal artery of the penis. This artery was then catheterised and injected with methylene blue to identify the perfused area. A skin flap was created by making a full thickness skin incision at the level of the fornix, along the circumference of the penis. The flap was developed by pulling the cut end toward the tip of the penis while undermining the skin. The flap was considered long enough when the cut end of the flap reached the level of the urethral opening. We also describe a case of preputial resection and reconstruction using this flap. Results Injection of methylene blue demonstrated the arterial supply to the skin flap. This flap was successful in treating the clinical case following resection of a mast cell tumour on the prepuce, although a small area of full thickness flap necrosis, which healed by second intention, developed postoperatively. Clinical Importance This technique may be useful for single step preputial reconstruction.

AB  - Objectives: To describe the electrocardiographic characteristics of ventricular tachycardia arising from the right ventricular outflow tract and the particular association between this arrhythmia and the presence of localised right ventricular outflow tract enlargement in English bulldogs. Methods: Five English bulldogs were referred with a history of syncope or cardiogenic shock. In all dogs, 12-lead surface ECG, thoracic radiograph and echocardiography were collected. In all but one dog 24-hours Holter monitoring and signal-averaged ECGs was examined and in one dog electrophysiological study and radiofrequency catheter ablation of the VT substrate was performed. Results: Documented arrhythmias included a single sustained monomorphic wide QRS tachycardia in four dogs, and an alternans of two different monomorphic forms in one dog. Mean QRS duration during tachy-cardia was 91·6 ±9·83 milliseconds. QRS complexes manifested a left bundle branch block morphology and an inferior axis (81 ±13·73°). R wave notching was present in the caudal (inferior) leads in three tachy-cardias. Lead I was negative in 3 of 6, positive in 1 of 6 and isodiphasic in 2 of 6. Lead aVL was negative in 5 of 6 and positive in 1 of 6. Signal-averaged electrocardiograms revealed late potentials in three dogs. Echocardiography showed a localised right ventricular outflow tract enlargement in all dogs. Cardiac map-ping established two sites of origin of ventricular tachycardia within the right ventricular outflow tract in one dog: caudal free-wall and cranial-septal. Clinical Significance: The presence of a localised right ventricular outflow tract enlargement and ventricular tachycardia with left bundle branch block morphology could suggest segmental arrhythmogenic right ven-tricular cardiomyopathy in the English bulldog.
