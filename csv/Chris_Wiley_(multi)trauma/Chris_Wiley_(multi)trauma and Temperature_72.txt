AB  - Abstract Bacterial skin and soft tissues infections (SSTI) often determine acute disease and frequent emergency recovering, and they are one of the most common causes of infection among groups of different ages. Given the variable presentation of SSTI, a thorough assessment of their incidence and prevalence is difficult. The presence of patient-related (local or systemic) or environmental risk factors, along with the emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogens, can promote SSTI. These infections may present with a wide spectrum of clinical features and different severity, and can be classified according to various criteria. Many bacterial species can cause SSTI, but Gram-positive bacteria are the most frequently isolated, with a predominance of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The diagnosis of SSTI requires an extended clinical history, a thorough physical examination and a high index of suspicion. Early diagnosis is particularly important in complicated infections, which often require laboratory studies, diagnostic imaging and surgical exploration. SSTI management should conform to the epidemiology, the aetiology, the severity and the depth of the infection. Topical, oral or systemic antimicrobial therapy and drainage or debridement could be necessary, along with treatment of a significant underlying disease. This review discusses the epidemiology, the pathogenesis and the classification of bacterial SSTI, describes their associated risk factors and their clinical presentations. The authors provide a rational diagnostic and therapeutic approach to SSTI in respect of antibiotic resistance and currently available antimicrobial agents.

AB  - Objectives: To describe the electrocardiographic characteristics of ventricular tachycardia arising from the right ventricular outflow tract and the particular association between this arrhythmia and the presence of localised right ventricular outflow tract enlargement in English bulldogs. Methods: Five English bulldogs were referred with a history of syncope or cardiogenic shock. In all dogs, 12-lead surface ECG, thoracic radiograph and echocardiography were collected. In all but one dog 24-hours Holter monitoring and signal-averaged ECGs was examined and in one dog electrophysiological study and radiofrequency catheter ablation of the VT substrate was performed. Results: Documented arrhythmias included a single sustained monomorphic wide QRS tachycardia in four dogs, and an alternans of two different monomorphic forms in one dog. Mean QRS duration during tachy-cardia was 91·6 ±9·83 milliseconds. QRS complexes manifested a left bundle branch block morphology and an inferior axis (81 ±13·73°). R wave notching was present in the caudal (inferior) leads in three tachy-cardias. Lead I was negative in 3 of 6, positive in 1 of 6 and isodiphasic in 2 of 6. Lead aVL was negative in 5 of 6 and positive in 1 of 6. Signal-averaged electrocardiograms revealed late potentials in three dogs. Echocardiography showed a localised right ventricular outflow tract enlargement in all dogs. Cardiac map-ping established two sites of origin of ventricular tachycardia within the right ventricular outflow tract in one dog: caudal free-wall and cranial-septal. Clinical Significance: The presence of a localised right ventricular outflow tract enlargement and ventricular tachycardia with left bundle branch block morphology could suggest segmental arrhythmogenic right ven-tricular cardiomyopathy in the English bulldog.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To estimate the risk of death and identify the major risk factors for peri-anaesthetic mortality in great apes (Hominidae) that underwent anaesthesia in zoological collections in the UK and Ireland between 1 January 1990 and 30 June 2005. Study design? confidential, retrospective cohort study. Animal population? The study population comprised all great apes from 16 zoological collections in the UK and Ireland that were anaesthetised during that period. Methods? All available anaesthetic records were collected. Outcome at 7?days post-anaesthesia was recorded as alive, dead or euthanased. The risk of peri-anaesthetic mortality was calculated. Multivariable analysis of potential risk factors was performed. Results? A total of 1182 anaesthetic records were collected and analysed. Sixteen peri-anaesthetic deaths occurred, resulting in a peri-anaesthetic mortality risk of 1.35%. Twenty percent of deaths (3/15) occurred during maintenance and 80% (12/15) occurred post-anaesthetic but within 7?days. A subjective assessment suggests at least five anaesthetic-related deaths occurred; in other words an anaesthetic-related mortality risk of 0.42% (5/1182) or above. In the multivariable analysis, health status and age were significantly associated with peri-anaesthetic mortality. Animals assessed as ?sick? pre-anaesthetic were associated with a 26-fold (95% CI 5.55?122.32) increased risk of death compared with animals with a good health status. Animals aged over 30?years were associated with a 30-fold (95% CI 3.44?261.85) increased risk of death, compared with adults aged between 10 and 30?years. Conclusions and clinical relevance? This study has shown that great ape anaesthesia appears to carry a high risk of mortality. Sick and aged patients are at an increased risk of death and particular care should be exercised during their anaesthesia. Standardisation and completeness of anaesthetic records across zoological collections would assist greatly in further studies.

AB  - Tracheal collapse with axial rotation was diagnosed in four dogs. Radiographs showed increased tracheal dorsoventral height at the caudal cervical and thoracic inlet with and apparent intraluminal soft tissue opacity, mimicking an intraluminal tracheal foreign body. Computed tomography confirmed dorsoventral tracheal collapse with axial rotation in all dogs. Short-term outcome with medical treatment of all dogs was excellent.

AB  - Objective To describe a reverse axial pattern flap based on the superficial branch of the dorsal penile artery and describe its use in preputial reconstruction. Materials and Methods Ten penises were harvested from canine cadavers; five were used to describe the dermatome supplied by the superficial branch of the dorsal artery of the penis and five to show perfusion of the skin flap. The superficial branch of the dorsal artery of the penis was identified fluoroscopically by injecting contrast material into the dorsal artery of the penis. This artery was then catheterised and injected with methylene blue to identify the perfused area. A skin flap was created by making a full thickness skin incision at the level of the fornix, along the circumference of the penis. The flap was developed by pulling the cut end toward the tip of the penis while undermining the skin. The flap was considered long enough when the cut end of the flap reached the level of the urethral opening. We also describe a case of preputial resection and reconstruction using this flap. Results Injection of methylene blue demonstrated the arterial supply to the skin flap. This flap was successful in treating the clinical case following resection of a mast cell tumour on the prepuce, although a small area of full thickness flap necrosis, which healed by second intention, developed postoperatively. Clinical Importance This technique may be useful for single step preputial reconstruction.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the minimum infusion rate (MIR) of propofol required to prevent purposeful movement in response to a standardized stimulus in goats. Study design Prospective, experimental study. Animals Eight healthy goats (four does, four wethers). Methods Anaesthesia was induced with 4 mg kg?1 propofol intravenously (IV). A continuous IV infusion of propofol at 0.6 mg kg?1 minute?1 was initiated immediately to maintain anaesthesia. Following endotracheal intubation, goats breathed spontaneously via a circle breathing system delivering supplementary oxygen. The initial propofol infusion rate was maintained for 30 minutes before responses to noxious stimulation provided by clamping the proximal part of the claw with a Vulsellum forceps for 60 seconds were tested. In the presence or absence of purposeful movements of the extremities, the infusion rate was increased or reduced by 0.1 mg kg?1 minute?1 and held constant for 30 minutes before claw clamping was repeated. The propofol MIR for each goat was calculated as the mean of the infusion rates that allowed and abolished movement. Basic cardiopulmonary parameters were monitored, recorded and tested for statistical significance using Wilcoxon's signed rank test with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing. The quality of recovery from anaesthesia was assessed and scored. Results The median MIR of propofol was 0.45 mg kg?1 minute?1 (range: 0.45?0.55 mg kg?1 minute?1). Induction and recovery were free of adverse behaviour. No statistically significant cardiopulmonary changes in comparison with baseline were observed, but clinically relevant hypoxaemia at 2 minutes after induction of anaesthesia was consistently observed. Chewing during anaesthesia was observed in three goats. Median times to extubation and standing were 3 minutes (range: 2?6 minutes) and 10 minutes (range: 7?21 minutes), respectively. Conclusions and clinical relevance Propofol induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia minimally compromise cardiopulmonary function when oxygen is supplemented in goats.

AB  - Summary This prospective, randomised, nonblinded study compared the clinical efficacy of cefquinome to that of a combination of penicillin and gentamicin. Patients (374 horses and 13 donkeys) at the equine hospital of the Vetsuisse-Faculty of Zurich, presented from February-October 2007, were divided into prophylactic and therapeutic treatment groups. Equids from these groups were randomly treated either with cefquinome or with the combination of sodium penicillin and gentamicin. There was no significant difference between the 2 treatment groups for prophylactic indications. In the therapeutic group, cefquinome showed better efficacy, as demonstrated by fewer complications of wound healing and fewer treatment failures with subsequent change to another antibiotic. Side effects were very rare in both treatment groups. Cefquinome can be used with safety and efficacy in equids. Cefquinome had greater efficacy than the combination of penicillin and gentamicin in the therapeutic group. However, there was no difference between the 2 antibiotic treatments in the prophylactic group. In order to minimise the development of resistance, cefquinome should therefore not be used for routine prophylactic treatment.

AB  - Abstract Background Over the past century, abdominal surgery has seen a rapid transition from open procedures to less invasive methods, such as robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (MIS). This study aimed to investigate and discuss the needs of MIS in terms of instrumentation and to inform the design of a novel instrument. Methods A survey was conducted among surgeons regarding their opinions on surgical training, surgical systems, how satisfied they were with them and how easy they were to use. A concept for MIS robotic instrumentation was then developed and a series of focus groups with surgeons were run to discuss it. The initial prototype of the robotic instruments, herein demonstrated, comprises modular rigid links with soft joints actuated by shape memory alloy helix actuators; these instruments are controlled using a sensory hand exoskeleton. Results The results of the survey, as well as those of the focus groups, are presented here. A first prototype of the system was built and initial laboratory tests have been conducted in order to evaluate this approach. Conclusions The analysed data from both the survey and the focus groups justify the chosen concept of an anthropomorphic MIS robotic system which imitates the natural motion of the hands.

AB  - Summary In the mid-1950s, the need of mass cultivation techniques for vaccine production led to the development of large-scale cell culture bioreactors. The rapid growth in biopharmaceutical industry, with a surge of protein, antibody, and peptide drugs expected in the next 10-20 years, has been led by various products produced by mammalian cells. Mammalian cells can be grown as suspension cells or as anchorage-dependent cells. A deep understanding of cell metabolism is crucial for designing feeding strategies to improve productivity and decrease culture costs. The metabolic pathways of glutamine and glucose have been reported to be quite similar to all mammalian cells including stem cells. Static culture systems such as multi well-plates, T-flasks, or tissue culture Petri dishes are the most widely used options for expanding mammalian cells. Two case studies focusing mammalian cell culture for antibody production and mouse embryonic stem cell culture, in bioreactors systems, are presented.

AB  - Anemon I is a new monitoring system that can be used to evaluate autonomic nervous system reactivity in real time by showing a simple, easily interpretated quantitative index (0?200), the Anemon Index (AI) (Junke et al. 2000). This study used the AI to evaluate the quality of analgesia during sevoflurane and fentanyl anaesthesia in pigs. Six healthy pigs, weighing 24.76?±?3.40?kg, were induced to anaesthesia with 5% sevoflurane (SEVO) in 5?L?minute?1 oxygen. After endotracheal intubation SEVO was given at 1 MAC (2.66%) in 3?L?minute?1 oxygen. Fentanyl was infused IV at 50?µg?kg?1?hour?1 for the first 30?minutes of anaesthesia, discontinued for 30?minutes, and then infused at 100?µg?kg?1?hour?1 for another 30?minutes. Three mechanical noxious stimuli (needle prick, pin-prick and pressure on the abdomen) were applied for 15?seconds at 30, 60 and 90?minutes. The AI, ECG, invasive mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), SpO2 by pulse oximetry, tidal volume, Fe?sevo, Fe?CO2 and respiratory rate were recorded before induction (baseline), after induction, after intubation and extubation, and before and during noxious stimulation at 30, 60 and 90?minutes. Recovery times were recorded. Statistically significant differences were determined by anova. Spearman rank-correlation was used to evaluate the relationship between AI and hemodynamic variables. A p-value of?<?0.05 was considered significant. A significant (p?<?0.01) decrease in AI was recorded after anaesthetic induction, from 82.3?±?21.1 to 52.7?±?20.3. After intubation, AI increased slightly, but not significantly, to 71.7?±?27.1. A significant (p?<?0.05) increase of AI occurred after extubation. Nociceptive stimuli did not have any measurable effect either on AI or on recorded cardiovascular variables. There was no movement, respiratory changes, or any other visible response to noxious stimulation. The AI did not change significantly with the different doses of fentanyl. Respiratory depression and apnoea were seen in all animals during the fentanyl infusion; therefore, pigs received intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Anaesthesia with sevoflurane and fentanyl resulted in a significant (p?<?0.001) decrease in MAP. Heart rate did not change significantly. There was no correlation between AI and cardiovascular variables (HR and MAP). Endotracheal intubation caused an increase and extubation a greater significant increase in the AI. This suggests that intubation and extubation may represent stressful events during general anaesthesia, although further studies are needed to validate the use of the AI in pigs. Sevoflurane anesthetic induction may not prevent the sympathetic stimulus caused by endotracheal intubation in pigs, as indicated by the increased AI values.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the minimum infusion rate (MIR) of alfaxalone required to prevent purposeful movement of the extremities in response to standardized noxious stimulation during its co-administration with fentanyl at three different doses by constant rate infusion (CRI) intravenously (IV) in goats. Study design Prospective, blinded, randomized crossover, experimental. Animals Eight healthy goats; four does and four wethers. Methods For induction of anaesthesia, a bolus of fentanyl was administered at 0.005 mg kg?1 (LFent), 0.015 mg kg?1 (MFent) or 0.03 mg kg?1 (HFent) followed by alfaxalone at 2.0 mg kg?1. For maintenance, the goats received alfaxalone at an initial infusion rate of 9.6 mg kg?1 hour?1 and one of three fentanyl treatments: 0.005 mg kg?1 hour?1(LFent), 0.015 mg kg?1 hour?1 (MFent) or 0.03 mg kg?1 hour?1 (HFent). The MIR of alfaxalone was determined during fentanyl CRI by testing for responses to stimulation (clamping on a digit with Vulsellum forceps) every 30 minutes. Some cardiopulmonary parameters were measured. Results The alfaxalone MIR median (range) was 6.7 (6.7?8.6), 2.9 (1.0?6.7) and 1.0 (1.0?4.8) mg kg?1 hour?1 during LFent, MFent and HFent, respectively. Alfaxalone MIR was significantly lower during MFENT and HFENT compared to LFENT. Significantly low oxygen haemoglobin saturation (SaO2) and arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2), observed 2 minutes into anaesthesia after all fentanyl treatments, were the most remarkable adverse cardiopulmonary effects observed. Recovery from anaesthesia was severely affected by high doses of fentanyl with excitatory behavioural signs predominant for up to 2 hours post-administration after MFent and HFent. Conclusions and clinical relevance Fentanyl reduces alfaxalone MIR in goats in a dose-dependent manner. Immediate oxygen supplementation after induction of general anaesthesia is recommended to prevent hypoxaemia. Doses of fentanyl equal to or greater than 0.015 mg kg?1 hour?1 tend to be associated with severe excitatory behaviour and should be avoided when fentanyl is administered to goats.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To examine the influence of a low dose dexmedetomidine infusion on the nociceptive withdrawal reflex and temporal summation in dogs during isoflurane anaesthesia. Study design? Prospective experimental blinded cross-over study. Animals? Eight healthy mixed breed dogs, body weight Mean?±?SD 26.5?±?8.4?kg and age 25?± 16 months. Methods? Anaesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with isoflurane (Fe?ISO 1.3%) delivered in oxygen and air. After stabilization, baseline recordings (time 0) were obtained, then a dexmedetomidine bolus (1??g?kg?1 IV) followed by a continuous rate infusion (1??g?kg?1?hour?1) or saline placebo were administered. At times 10, 30 and 60?minutes after the initial bolus, electrical stimulations of increasing intensity were applied over the lateral plantar digital nerve, and administered both as single and as repeated stimuli. The resulting reflex responses were recorded using electromyography. Data were analysed using a multivariable linear regression model and a Kruskal Wallis test for single stimulation data, and repeated measures anova and paired t-test for repeated stimulation data. Results? The AUC for the stimulus-response curves after single stimulation were similar for both treatments at time 0. At times 10, 30 and 60 the AUCs for the stimulus-response curves were significantly lower with dexmedetomidine treatment than with placebo. Temporal summation was evident in both treatments at times 0, 10, 30 and 60 starting from a stimulation intensity of 10?mA. The magnitude of temporal summation was smaller in dexmedetomidine than in placebo treated dogs at time 10, 30 and 60, but not at time 0. Conclusions? During isoflurane anaesthesia, low dose dexmedetomidine suppresses the nociceptive reflex responses after single and repeated electrical stimulation. Clinical relevance? This experimental study confirms previous reports on its peri-operative efficacy under clinical conditions, and further indicates that dexmedetomidine might reduce the risk of post-operative chronic pain development.

AB  - This study investigated the characteristics of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) produced by mivacurium in the cat. Mivacurium is a short acting nondepolarizing muscle relaxant, which undergoes rapid hydrolysis by plasma cholinesterase and is expected to have a predictable effect of short duration (Maehr et al. 1991; Gyermek et al. 1999). Thirteen cats (seven females, six males) aged 2?14?years, body mass 3.5?5.9?kg, undergoing corneal surgery were anaesthetized with propofol (3?6?mg?kg?1 IV) after pre-anesthetic medication IM with an opioid alone or in combination with acepromazine (0.02?mg?kg?1) or medetomidine (0.01?mg?kg?1). Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (13 cats) or halothane (1 cat) in oxygen (33%) and nitrous oxide (66%) with mechanical ventilation. Cats were monitored using an ECG, side-stream capnography, and a Doppler flow sensor which was positioned on the pedal artery to estimate systolic blood pressure. The peroneal nerve was stimulated with a train-of-four (TOF) and Double Burst (DBS) pattern using a peripheral nerve stimulator, to assess the degree of NMB. Mivacurium IV (0.1?mg?kg?1) was administered over 10?seconds. The TOF stimulation was applied every 12?seconds until no twitch was apparent (onset time) and continued until the TOF ratio was considered to be 1. Response to DBS stimulation was then assessed until the ratio was 1. The same procedure was followed after recovery of a DBS ratio of 1, if administration of a further dose of mivacurium (0.05?mg?kg?1) was required. Times of onset of NMB, return of the 1st and 4th twitches, TOF and DBS ratio of 1, were recorded, and descriptive analyses performed. The effects of mivacurium on heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SAP) and variations in onset and recovery time of NMB between the first bolus and the subsequent doses were determined using a paired Student t-test. The HR and SAP did not change significantly after administration of mivacurium. The onset time was significantly shorter (p?<?0.0001) after administration of the second dose of mivacurium (48?±?8?seconds) compared to the initial dose (107?±?17?seconds). The time to return of the first twitch (11?minutes 12?seconds?±?3?minutes 26?seconds) and to DBS 1 (16?minutes 41?seconds?±?4?minutes 21?seconds) were longer after the first dose than after subsequent doses (8?minutes 56?seconds ±?2?minutes 2?seconds and 18?minutes 28?seconds ±?7?minutes 19?seconds, respectively). However, a second dose of mivacurium was administered in only three cats. Reversal of NMB was never required. Mivacurium is a short acting muscle relaxant in the cat, without apparent cumulative effect after repeated dosing. The time to complete recovery in 97.5% of patients after a single bolus is estimated to be 25?minutes (mean?±?2 SD).

AB  - Abstract Retinal degeneration (RD) results in photoreceptor loss and irreversible visual impairments. This study sought to alleviate the photoreceptor degeneration via the adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated erythropoietin (EPO) therapy. AAV-2/2-mCMV-EPO vectors were constructed and delivered into the subretinal space of a RD model. The retinal morphology, optokinetic behaviour and electrophysiological function of the treated animals were analysed. The subretinal delivery of AAV-2/2 vectors induced robust EPO gene expressions in the retinas. AAV2/2-mediated EPO therapy ameliorated the photoreceptor degeneration and visual impairments of the RD animal model. Furthermore, the multi-electrodes array (MEA) was used to detect the firing activities of retinal ganglion cells. MEA recording showed that the EPO therapy could restrain the spontaneous firing response, enhance the light-induced firing response and preserve the basic configurations of visual signal pathway in RD model. Our MEA assay provided an example to evaluate the potency of pharmacological compounds on retinal plasticity. In conclusion, AAV2/2-mediated EPO therapy can ameliorate the photoreceptor degeneration and rectify the abnormities in visual signal transmission. These beneficial results suggest the AAV vector is a viable therapeutic option for retinopathies with rapidly degenerating kinetics and lay the groundwork for future development of EPO gene therapy.

AB  - The MRI community is using quantitative mapping techniques to complement qualitative imaging. For quantitative imaging to reach its full potential, it is necessary to analyze measurements across systems and longitudinally. Clinical use of quantitative imaging can be facilitated through adoption and use of a standard system phantom, a calibration/standard reference object, to assess the performance of an MRI machine. The International Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine AdHoc Committee on Standards for Quantitative Magnetic Resonance was established in February 2007 to facilitate the expansion of MRI as a mainstream modality for multi-institutional measurements, including, among other things, multicenter trials. The goal of the Standards for Quantitative Magnetic Resonance committee was to provide a framework to ensure that quantitative measures derived from MR data are comparable over time, between subjects, between sites, and between vendors. This paper, written by members of the Standards for Quantitative Magnetic Resonance committee, reviews standardization attempts and then details the need, requirements, and implementation plan for a standard system phantom for quantitative MRI. In addition, application-specific phantoms and implementation of quantitative MRI are reviewed. Magn Reson Med 79:48?61, 2018. ? 2017 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.

AB  - Abstract Objective  To investigate the influence of a dexmedetomidine constant rate infusion (CRI) in horses anaesthetized with isoflurane. Study design  Prospective, randomized, blinded, clinical study. Animals  Forty adult healthy horses (weight mean 491?±?SD 102?kg) undergoing elective surgery. Methods  After sedation [dexmedetomidine, 3.5 ??g ?kg?1 intravenously (IV)] and induction IV (midazolam 0.06?mg?kg?1, ketamine 2.2?mg?kg?1), anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen/air (FiO2 55?60%). Horses were ventilated and dobutamine was administered when hypoventilation [arterial partial pressure of CO2?>?8.00?kPa (60?mmHg)] and hypotension [arterial pressure 70?mmHg] occurred respectively. During anaesthesia, horses were randomly allocated to receive a CRI of dexmedetomidine (1.75??g?kg?1?hour?1) (D) or saline (S). Monitoring included end-tidal isoflurane concentration, cardiopulmonary parameters, and need for dobutamine and additional ketamine. All horses received 0.875??g?kg?1 dexmedetomidine IV for the recovery period. Age and weight of the horses, duration of anaesthesia, additional ketamine and dobutamine, cardiopulmonary data (anova), recovery scores (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test), duration of recovery (t-test) and attempts to stand (Mann?Whitney test) were compared between groups. Significance was set at p?<?0.05. Results  Heart rate and arterial partial pressure of oxygen were significantly lower in group D compared to group S. An interaction between treatment and time was present for cardiac index, oxygen delivery index and systemic vascular resistance. End-tidal isoflurane concentration and heart rate significantly increased over time. Packed cell volume, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure, arterial oxygen content, stroke volume index and systemic vascular resistance significantly decreased over time. Recovery scores were significantly better in group D, with fewer attempts to stand and significantly longer times to sternal position and first attempt to stand. Conclusions and clinical relevance  A dexmedetomidine CRI produced limited cardiopulmonary effects, but significantly improved recovery quality.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Porcine Respiratory Disease Complex (PRDC) is one of the most common and costly clinical conditions encountered in veterinary medicine in commercially kept pigs. In this introductory article (sponsored by Intervet/Schering Plough AH), the clinical presentation in both the individual pig and groups will be described, along with the pathological lesions encountered. The multiple aetiological factors involved in the syndrome, ranging from primary and secondary infectious agents to environmental and managemental factors will be explored. Diagnostic and monitoring methods are also discussed. Subsequent articles will look in detail at specific elements of the syndrome.
