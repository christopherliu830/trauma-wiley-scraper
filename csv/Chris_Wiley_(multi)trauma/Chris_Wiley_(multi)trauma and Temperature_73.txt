AB  - Summary Orthostatic hypotension (OH) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is more common than previously perceived, as it may appear to cause no symptoms, or may result in complications from hypotension, such as falls, often being erroneously attributed to other causes. OH may be an initial sign of sympathetic failure, as commonly occurs in multiple system atrophy (MSA) and diffuse Lewy body disease. The usual method of detecting OH, with lying and standing blood pressure measurements performed after being upright for at least 3 min, may not detect OH in PD as the fall in blood pressure when upright may take longer. Furthermore, various stimuli in daily life such as food intake and anti-parkinsonian drugs may unmask or exacerbate an orthostatic fall in blood pressure. Symptoms indicative of OH are numerous and do not necessarily include loss of consciousness and syncope. Recognition of OH is important in diagnosis (as it may be an initial sign in MSA), in reducing potential trauma due to falls, and in enabling the use of increased dosage of, or additional, anti-parkinsonian drugs, when OH is a limiting factor. Of clinical importance is that OH can be effectively treated, using a combination of non-pharmacological and drug measures, which reduce morbidity and can substantially improve quality-of-life in patients with PD.

AB  - Abstract Objective? Evaluation of five pulse oximeters in dogs, cats and horses with sensors placed at five sites and hemoglobin saturation at three plateaus. Study design? Prospective randomized multispecies experimental trial. Animals? Five healthy dogs, cats and horses. Methods? Animals were anesthetized and instrumented with ECG leads and arterial catheters. Five pulse oximeters (Nellcor Puritan Bennett-395, NPB-190, NPB-290, NPB-40 and Surgi-Vet V3304) with sensors at five sites were studied in a 5???5 Latin square design. Ten readings (SpO2) were taken at each of three hemoglobin saturation plateaus (98, 85 and 72%) in each animal. Arterial samples were drawn concurrently and hemoglobin saturation was measured with a co-oximeter. Accuracy of saturation measurements was calculated as the root mean squared difference (RMSD), a composite of bias and precision, for each model tested in each species. Results? Accuracy varied widely. In dogs, the RMSD for the NPB-395, NPB-190, NPB-290, NPB-40 and V3304 were 2.7, 2.2, 2.4, 1.7 and 2.7% respectively. Failure to produce readings for the NPB-395, NPB-190, NPB-290, NPB-40 and V3304 were 0, 0, 0.7, 0, and 20%, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficients for the tongue, toe, ear, lip and prepuce or vulva were 0.95, 0.97, 0.69, 0.87 and 0.95, respectively. In horses, the RMSD for the NPB-395, NPB-190, NPB-290, NPB-40 and V3304 were 3.1, 3.0, 4.7, 3.3 and 2.1%, respectively while rates of failure to produce readings were 10, 21, 0, 17 and 60%, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficients for the tongue, nostril, ear, lip and prepuce or vulva were 0.98, 0.94, 0.88, 0.93 and 0.94, respectively. In cats, the RMSD for all data for the NPB-395, NPB-190, NPB-290, NPB-40 and V3304 were 5.9, 5.6, 7.9, 7.9 and 10.7%, respectively while failure rates were 0, 0.7, 0, 20 and 32%, respectively. The correlation coefficients for the tongue, rear paw, ear, lip and front paw were 0.54, 0.79,.0.64, 0.49 and 0.57, respectively. For saturations above 90% in cats, the RMSD for the NPB-395, NPB-190, NPB-290, NPB-40 and V3304 were 2.6, 4.4, 4.0, 3.5 and 4.8%, respectively, while failure rates were 0, 1.7, 0, 25 and 43%, respectively. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Accuracy and failure rates (failure to produce a reading) varied widely from model to model and from species to species. Generally, among the models tested in the clinically relevant range (90?100%) RMSD ranged from 2?5% while failure rates were highest in the V3304.

AB  - Implication of Pigment Cell Biology for Understanding Human Diseases was the topic of the The Sixth Annual Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center: Carcinogenesis and Cancer Prevention conference, jointly sponsored by the University of California Irvine College of Medicine and the PanAmerican Society of Pigment Cell Research This was a multi-disciplinary, three-and-one-half day conference for basic science and clinical investigators. The overall objectives of the meeting were to expand ideas, approaches, and collaborations for members of the society by bringing together experts in disciplines relevant to pigment cell research and associated diseases such as melanoma, albinoism, vitiligo, and other diseases of pigment cells. The meeting focused on recent developments in the genetics, novel gene function, gene expression pattern, and post-transcriptional processing of melanocyte specific proteins, melanosome function, melanin structure, and implications of recent basic advances for understanding human pigmentary diseases. These areas have been particularly productive due to recent breakthroughs and rapid progress in microarray gene expression, mass spectrometry, atomic force microscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and other physical chemical and molecular biotechnologies.

AB  - Abstract Extended human longevity has resulted in increasing numbers of elderly persons in the general population. However, old age is also associated with a variety of serious physical disorders. Frailty among sedentary elderly patients is related to the impaired structure and function of contractile fibers. Biochemical research into cellular mechanisms that underlie sarcopenia promises to acquire the scientific basis of evidence to aid the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The recent application of MS-based proteomic methodology has identified a large cohort of disease-specific markers of sarcopenia. This review critically examines the biomedical implications of the results obtained from the proteomic screening of both aged human muscle and established animal models of sarcopenia. Substantial alterations in proteins involved in key metabolic pathways, regulatory and contractile elements of the actomyosin apparatus, myofibrillar remodeling and the cellular stress response are discussed. A multi-factorial etiology appears to be the basis for a slower-twitching aged fiber population, which exhibits a shift to more aerobic-oxidative metabolism. It is hoped that the detailed biomedical characterization of the newly identified biomarkers of sarcopenia will translate into better treatment options for reversing age-dependent muscle degeneration, which could improve the standard of living for a large portion of society.

AB  - Abstract This study aims to compare the therapeutic effectiveness of continuous catheter drainage versus intermittent needle aspiration in the percutaneous treatment of pyogenic liver abscesses. Over a 5-year period, 64 consecutive patients with pyogenic liver abscess were treated with intravenous antibiotics (ampicillin, cefuroxime, and metronidazole) and randomized into two percutaneous treatment groups: continuous catheter drainage (with an 8F multi-sidehole pigtail catheter); and intermittent needle aspiration (18G disposable trocar needle). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding patient demographics, underlying coexisting disease, abscess size, abscess number, number of loculation of abscess, the presenting clinical symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, and pretreatment liver function test. Although not statistically significant, the duration of intravenous antibiotics treatment before percutaneous treatment was longer with the catheter group, and the change of antibiotics after the sensitivity test was more frequent with the needle group. The needle group was associated with a higher treatment success rate, a shorter duration of hospital stay, and a lower mortality rate, although this did not reach statistical significance. In conclusion, this study suggests that intermittent needle aspiration is probably as effective as continuous catheter drainage for the treatment of pyogenic liver abscess, although further proof with a large-scale study is necessary. Due to the additional advantages of procedure simplicity, patient comfort, and reduced price, needle aspiration deserves to be considered as a first-line drainage approach.

AB  - Abstract Objective  To investigate the influence of a dexmedetomidine constant rate infusion (CRI) in horses anaesthetized with isoflurane. Study design  Prospective, randomized, blinded, clinical study. Animals  Forty adult healthy horses (weight mean 491?±?SD 102?kg) undergoing elective surgery. Methods  After sedation [dexmedetomidine, 3.5 ??g ?kg?1 intravenously (IV)] and induction IV (midazolam 0.06?mg?kg?1, ketamine 2.2?mg?kg?1), anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen/air (FiO2 55?60%). Horses were ventilated and dobutamine was administered when hypoventilation [arterial partial pressure of CO2?>?8.00?kPa (60?mmHg)] and hypotension [arterial pressure 70?mmHg] occurred respectively. During anaesthesia, horses were randomly allocated to receive a CRI of dexmedetomidine (1.75??g?kg?1?hour?1) (D) or saline (S). Monitoring included end-tidal isoflurane concentration, cardiopulmonary parameters, and need for dobutamine and additional ketamine. All horses received 0.875??g?kg?1 dexmedetomidine IV for the recovery period. Age and weight of the horses, duration of anaesthesia, additional ketamine and dobutamine, cardiopulmonary data (anova), recovery scores (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test), duration of recovery (t-test) and attempts to stand (Mann?Whitney test) were compared between groups. Significance was set at p?<?0.05. Results  Heart rate and arterial partial pressure of oxygen were significantly lower in group D compared to group S. An interaction between treatment and time was present for cardiac index, oxygen delivery index and systemic vascular resistance. End-tidal isoflurane concentration and heart rate significantly increased over time. Packed cell volume, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure, arterial oxygen content, stroke volume index and systemic vascular resistance significantly decreased over time. Recovery scores were significantly better in group D, with fewer attempts to stand and significantly longer times to sternal position and first attempt to stand. Conclusions and clinical relevance  A dexmedetomidine CRI produced limited cardiopulmonary effects, but significantly improved recovery quality.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To record the electroencephalographic changes during castration in ponies anaesthetized with halothane and given intravenous (IV) lidocaine by infusion. The hypothesis tested was that in ponies, IV lidocaine is antinociceptive and would therefore obtund EEG changes during castration. Animals? Ten Welsh mountain ponies referred to the Department of Clinical Veterinary Medicine, Cambridge for castration under general anaesthesia. Materials and methods? Following pre-anaesthetic medication with intramuscular acepromazine (0.02?mg?kg?1) anaesthesia was induced with IV guaiphenesin (60?mg?kg?1) and thiopental (9 mg?kg?1) and maintained with halothane at an end-tidal concentration (Fe?HAL) of 1.2%. A constant rate infusion of IV lidocaine (100??g?kg?1?minute?1) was administered throughout anaesthesia. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded continuously using subcutaneous needle electrodes. All animals were castrated using a closed technique. The raw EEG signal was analysed after completion of each investigation, and the mean values of EEG variables (median frequency, spectral edge frequency, total amplitude) recorded during a baseline period (before surgery began) and the removal of each testicle were compared using anova for repeated measures. Results? Spectral edge frequency (SEF) 95% decreased during removal of the second testicle compared with baseline recordings. No other significant EEG changes during castration were measured. Conclusions? Lidocaine obtunded the EEG changes identified during castration in a previous control study, providing indirect evidence that lidocaine administered peri-operatively was antinociceptive and contributed to anaesthesia during castration. Clinical relevance? The antinociceptive effect of lidocaine combined with its minimal cardiovascular effects indicate a potential use for systemic lidocaine in clinical anaesthetic techniques.

AB  - This clinical study analysed the anaesthetic sparing effect of a medetomidine constant rate infusion (CRI) during isoflurane anaesthesia in horses. Forty healthy horses undergoing different types of orthopaedic and soft tissue surgeries were studied in a randomized trial. Orthopaedic surgeries were primarily arthroscopies and splint bone extractions. Soft tissue surgeries were principally castrations with one ovariectomy. All horses received 0.03?mg?kg?1 acepromazine IM 1?hour prior to sedation. Group A (11 orthopaedic and nine soft tissue surgeries), was sedated with 1.1?mg?kg?1 xylazine IV, group B (13 orthopaedic and seven soft tissue surgeries) with 7?µg?kg?1 medetomidine IV. Anaesthesia was induced in both groups with 2.2?mg?kg?1 ketamine and diazepam 0.02?mg?kg?1 IV. Maintenance of anaesthesia was with isoflurane (ISO) in 100% oxygen, depth of anaesthesia was always adjusted by the first author. Group B received an additional CRI of 3.5?µg?kg?1?hour?1 medetomidine. Respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), Fe?ISO and Fe?CO2 were monitored with a methane insensitive monitor (Cardiocap 5, Ohmeda, Anandic, Diessenhofen) and noted every 5?minutes. Arterial blood was withdrawn for gas analysis (PaO2, PaCO2) 5?minutes after the induction of anaesthesia and every 30?minutes thereafter. Dobutamine (DOB) was given as a CRI to maintain mean arterial blood pressure above 70?mm?Hg. Data were averaged over time (sum of measurements/number of measurements) and tested for differences between groups by unpaired t-tests. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of body mass (group A, 508?±?73.7?kg; group B, 529.25?±?78.4?kg) or duration of anaesthesia (group A, 125.5?±?36?minutes; group B, 121.5?±?48.4?minutes). The mean Fe?ISO required to maintain a surgical plane of anaesthesia was significantly higher in group A (1.33?±?0.13%) than in group B (1.07?±?0.19%; p?=?2.78???10?5). Heart rate was different between the two groups (group A, 42.2?±?8.3; group B, 32.6?±?3.5; p?=?8.8???10?5). Dobutamine requirements were higher in group A (group A, 0.72?±?0.24??g?kg?1?minute?1; group B, 0.53?±?0.23??g?kg?1?minute?1; p?=?0.023). Respiratory rate, Fe?CO2, PaO2, PaCO2 were not different between the groups. Adjustment of anaesthetic depth subjectively was easier with the medetomidine infusion and isoflurane (group B) than with isoflurane as a sole agent (group A). In group A 12 horses and in group B five horses showed purposeful movements on 27 (A) and 12 (B) occasions. They were given thiopental (group A, 0.0114?mg?kg?1?minute?1; group B, 0.0023?mg?kg?1?minute?1). In group A, a further 17 horses were given ketamine to deepen anaesthesia (52 occasions, 0.00426?mg?kg?1?minute?1) whereas in group B only nine horses needed ketamine (34 occasions, 0.00179?mg?kg?1?minute?1). An infusion of 3.5?µg?kg?1 MED during ISO anaesthesia resulted in a significantly reduced ISO requirement.

AB  - This study evaluated the antinociceptive and physiologic effects of xylazine (X) and detomidine (D) administered intrathecally (IT) at the lumbosacral space, before and after the injection of atipamezole (A) IV. The study was approved by the National Animal Protection Authorities. Five adult healthy female sheep were anaesthetized with propofol on four occasions to inject the following treatments IT: groups 1 and 2, 0.05?mg?kg?1 X (2?mg?mL?1 saline) IT; groups 3 and 4, 0.01?mg?kg?1 D (0.5?mg?mL?1 saline) IT (Waterman et al. 1988). Nociceptive threshold (TH) was tested by applying pulsed and stepwise enhanced direct current (Ludbrook et al. 1995) at one hind leg pastern and noting the current at the moment of foot lift. Maximum current applied was 40 mA. Baseline TH was measured twice before anaesthesia and every 10?minutes when the sheep regained consciousness. Atipamezole was given IV immediately after reaching maximum analgesic action of X and D as defined by two equal or decreasing TH values and measurements were continued for 90?minutes. The dose of A for groups 1 and 3 was 0.005?mg?kg?1 (0.25?mg?mL?1 saline) IV, and for groups 2 and 4 was 0.0025?mg?kg?1 A (0.25?mg?mL?1 saline) IV. Heart rate (HR), mean direct arterial pressure (MAP), PaO2 and PaCO2 were measured. The differences between measurements recorded before and after treatment were analysed using a paired t-test for the drug effects and a nonparametric Wilcoxon's rank sum test for the comparison between groups. A p-value?<?0.05 was considered significant. All sheep were able to stand before A IV. Threshold baseline value was 4.5?±?1.7 (mean?±?SD) mA for all animals. Xylazine caused a significantly higher TH rise (35.2?±?1.8 mA), faster onset (21.1?±?16.0?minutes) and longer duration of the TH enhancement (104.1?±?8.6?minutes) than D (TH: 16.3?±?7.8 mA, onset: 49.5?±?28.4?minutes, duration: 59.3?±?27.3?minutes). A significant increase in PaCO2 was observed in the X and D treated animals, 0.39?±?0.21?kPa (2.9?±?1.6?mm?Hg) and 0.39?±?0.29?kPa (2.9?±?2.2?mm?Hg), respectively. Heart rate was significantly decreased by ?21?±?17 beats minute?1 for X animals and ?13?±?13 beats minute?1 for D. Mean arterial pressure (?9?±?13?mm?Hg for X and ?1?±?11?mm?Hg for D animals) and PaO2 0.65?±?1.32?kPa (4.9?±?9.9?mm?Hg) for X and 1.45?±?4.19?kPa (10.9?±?31.4?mm?Hg) for D animals) did not change significantly. The nociceptive threshold was not affected by A in any group. Threshold values of all X treated animals before A was 39.3?±?1.4 mA and after was 37.2?±?6.3 (group 1) and 40?±?0 (group 2). Threshold values of all D treated animals before A was 21.0?±?8.3 and after was 19.4?±?7.3 (group 3) and 24.8?±?8.0 (group 4). At the dosages administered intrathecally in this study, X and to a lower degree D induce antinociception without major physiologic changes. Atipamezole up to 0.005?mg?kg?1 IV does not affect the resulting antinociception as assessed by electrical stimulation.

AB  - Objectives To investigate the benefit of supplementing amoxicillin-clavulanic acid therapy with metronidazole in dogs presenting to a primary care veterinary practice with severe haemorrhagic diarrhoea. Materials and Methods Prospective randomised blinded trial on dogs presenting with haemorrhagic diarrhoea of less than 3 days duration to a primary care veterinary hospital and also requiring intravenous fluid therapy. Cases were randomised to receive either metronidazole or saline, in addition to standard supportive therapy consisting of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, intravenous fluid therapy, buprenorphine and omeprazole. Treatment efficacy was measured by duration of hospitalisation and daily scoring of disease severity. Results Thirty-four cases successfully completed the trial. There was no significant difference in hospitalisation time between treatment groups (mean for dogs receiving metronidazole was 29.6 hours and for controls was 26.3 hours) nor in daily clinical scores. Clinical Significance This study strongly suggests that addition of metronidazole is not an essential addition to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid therapy for treatment of severe cases of haemorrhagic diarrhoea in dogs.

AB  - Near-infrared-spectroscopy (NIRS; Jöbsis 1977) has been used in humans to measure regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rsO2), decreases of which can be indicative of a critical cerebral O2 supply (Kirkpatrick et al. 1998). This study investigated changes in rsO2, the redox status of cytochrome a/a3, and the cerebral total hemoglobin content using NIRS during different sedative and anaesthetic techniques in dogs. Eighty four foxhounds and 32 beagles aged 12.9?±?13.4 (6.3?94.4) (±SD (range)) months and weighing 24.8?±?6.6 (2.7?43) kg were divided randomly into four groups. Group AM received 0.1?mg?kg?1 acepromazine and 0.5?mg?kg?1 l-methadone/fenpipramid (l-Polamivet) IV, group DM 0.5?mg?kg?1 diazepam and 0.5?mg?kg?1 l-Polamivet IV, and group MM 40?µg?kg?1 medetomidine and 0.5?mg?kg?1 l-Polamivet IV. Group P was anaesthetized (7?mg?kg?1) and maintained (0.3?mg?kg?1?minute?1) with propofol. Thirty minutes after sedation groups AM, DM and MM received 8?µg?kg?1 naloxone IV, and at 35?minutes group MM received 200?µg?kg?1 atipamezole IV. NRIS was monitored continuously (recording interval, 1?second). Blood gases were analysed before and every 5?minutes after sedation or induction, and at 2 and 7?minutes post-naloxone injection or end of propofol infusion. Descriptive and comparative statistics (global: Kruskal?Wallis test, level of significance α?=?0.05, group comparison: Mann?Whitney test, α?=?0.0083), and Spearman's correlation were determined using the statistical software SPSS. Before drug administration rsO2 was 65?±?7% (n?=?109). One minute after drug administration significant differences between groups were found (Table 1). There was a significant increase of about 8% in rsO2 over time in the p group, whereas groups AM, DM and MM showed a significant decrease with the greatest reduction of 20% in group MM. One minute after naloxone IV pre-induction values were rapidly attained in groups AM (65.2?±?6%, n?=?31) and DM (65.4?±?5.4%, n?=?24) while in group MM (52.1?±?10.8%, n?=?27) pre-induction values of rsO2 were not reached until 1?minute after atipamezole IV (62.9?±?7.4%). Periodic breathing (MM) was mirrored by variations of rsO2. There were no significant changes or intergroup differences in the redox state of cytochrome a/a3 or of total cerebral hemoglobin content indicating cerebral blood volume (Wyatt et al. 1990). The 20% decrease in rsO2 in group MM is in the range regarded as indicative of a critical cerebral O2 supply in humans (Kirkpatrick et al. 1998). The effects of naloxone and atipamezole and the correlation with blood gas analysis demonstrate an influence of respiratory depression on the vascular cerebral O2 status whereas the lack of cytochrome a/a3 reduction indicates an undisturbed cellular O2 supply (Jöbsis 1977). In spite of some limitations in terms of applicability (Alef 2002). NIRS seems to enable the influence of clinical routines on cerebral oxygenation to be monitored although further validation of NIRS in the dog and the cat is required.

AB  - An economical anaesthetic technique of short duration that can be administered to piglets in the field is desirable for humanitarian reasons, for castration, tail docking or other brief procedures. Using the principles of anaesthetic uptake and distribution, an inhaler was developed to vaporize and administer isoflurane to piglets. The inhaler design consisted of a mask, vaporization chamber and a rebreathing bag. A stopcock provided access for injection of liquid isoflurane onto a wick contained in the vaporization chamber. Inspiratory and expiratory flow of air over the wick enhanced anaesthetic vaporization. The amount of liquid isoflurane required for induction and 2?3?minutes of surgical anaesthesia was calculated using the square root of time model proposed by Lowe & Ernst (1981) for liquid injection, closed circuit anaesthesia in people. Calculations were based on an assumed MAC of 1.4% and the achievement of a target alveolar concentration of 1.3 MAC to provide a surgical plane of anaesthesia. The appropriate isoflurane concentrations in the mask, inhaler, rebreathing bag and the piglet's FRC and tissues were calculated. Original calculations were based on metabolic size (BW0.75) and then converted to weight (kg). Based on the piglet's scale weight, the total microliters of liquid isoflurane required were formulated into a table for field use. Isoflurane was injected into the inhaler stopcock followed by oxygen to fill the rebreathing bag and initiate vaporization. After the mask was placed over the piglet's nose a slide switch was activated to allow gases to move in and out of the inhaler and rebreathing bag. Fifty-seven male piglets weighing (mean?±?SD 3.0?±?0.7?kg) and aged 7.7?±?1.0?days were randomly selected to receive anaesthesia prior to castration. Remaining littermates served as controls for assessing morbidity or mortality. The time to induction, recovery and total anaesthetic time were measured. The Pe?CO2 was measured at the piglet's nostril immediately after the mask was removed at the end of the surgical procedure. Data were analysed in SAS using the Proc Mixed procedure. Inductions were rapid, 47?±?9?seconds, generally with minimal or no resistance. The duration of surgery was 1?2?minutes. Anaesthesia was adequate and recovery was rapid, 122?±?44?seconds. Total time from start to standing was 260?±?51?seconds. The Pe?CO2 was 5.2?±?1.1?kPa (39.4?±?8.4?mm?Hg). There was no morbidity or mortality associated with either group of piglets. After piglets were standing and mobile, they were returned to the sow and other littermates, where they immediately started nursing and were indistinguishable from littermates except by determination of ear notch number. This technique provides safe, rapid anaesthesia and recovery that is appropriate for use by veterinarians for brief field procedures.

AB  - A central eyeball position is often required during sedation or anaesthesia to facilitate examination of the eye. However, use of neuromuscular blockade to produce a central eye position may result in depressed ventilation. This study evaluated the eyeball position, muscle relaxation and changes in ventilation during general anaesthesia after the IV administration of 0.1?mg?kg?1 rocuronium. With client consent, 12 dogs of different breeds, body mass 27.2?±?11.8?kg, aged 5.6?±?2.8?years (mean?±?SD) were anaesthetized for ocular examination. Pre-anaesthetic medication was 0.01?mg?kg?1 medetomidine and 0.2?mg?kg?1 butorphanol IV. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol to effect and maintained with 10?mg?kg?1?hour?1 propofol by infusion. The dogs were placed in left lateral recumbency, their trachea intubated and connected to a circle breathing system (FiO2?=?1.0). All dogs breathed spontaneously. The superficial peroneal nerve of the right hind leg was stimulated every 15?seconds with a train-of-four (TOF) stimulation pattern and neuromuscular function was assessed with an acceleromyograph (TOF-Guard). Adequacy of ventilation was measured with the Ventrak 1550. After 10?minutes of anaesthesia to allow stabilisation of baseline values, 0.1?mg?kg?1 rocuronium was administered IV. Minute volume (Vm), tidal volume (Vt), respiratory rate (RR), Pe?CO2 and maximal depression of T1 and TOF ratio were measured. Data were analysed using a paired t-test. The changes in the eyeball position were recorded. A total of 100?±?33?seconds after the injection of rocuronium, T1 was maximally depressed to 62?±?21% and the TOF ratio to 42?±?18% of baseline values. Both variables returned to baseline after 366?±?132?seconds (T1) and 478?±?111?seconds (TOF). There was no significant reduction in Vm (2.32?±?1.1?L?minute?1), Vt (124.1?±?69.3?mL) and RR (10?±?3.8?breaths?minute?1) and no increase in Pe?CO2 (6.5?±?2.1?kPa (48.8?±?16.1?mm?Hg)) throughout the procedure. The eyeball rotated to a central position 35?±?7?seconds after rocuronium IV and remained there for a minimum of 20?±?7?minutes in all dogs. We conclude that rocuronium at a dose of 0.1?mg?kg?1 can be administered to dogs IV with minimal changes in ventilatory variables. The eyeball is fixed in a central position for at least 20?minutes, which greatly facilitates clinical examination.

AB  - Abstract Pediatric cancers are a highly heterogeneous group of malignancies, with variable prognoses and treatments. Tumors of the brain and central nervous system (CNS) represent the most common childhood malignancy, followed by leukemia, with an annual incidence of 5.57 per 100 000 population, and are the most common pediatric malignancies requiring radiation therapy. Osteosarcoma is the most common primary pediatric bone tumor, accounting for 3% of childhood malignancies and with approximately 400 cases diagnosed each year. Treatment includes the use of multi-agent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a regimen that includes methotrexate, cisplatin, and doxorubicin, among other agents. Ewing sarcoma is the second most common pediatric sarcoma, with approximately 200-250 cases per year in the United States. Treatment of Ewing's sarcoma includes chemotherapy and surgery and/or radiation. Following cancer treatment, pediatric patients require lifelong care and surveillance for potential late side effects of therapy.

AB  - AbstractThis paper considers community-based adaptation (CBA) to climate change and its relationship to the theory and practice of participatory development. It is argued that CBA needs to recognise the considered experience of participatory development to date, particularly in relation to local involvement in project planning and implementation, as well as acknowledging the specific challenges raised by climate change. Without attention to risks and uncertainty, political structures and institutions, the necessarily multi-level nature of adaptation policy and programming, and the links between mitigation and adaptation politics and practice, outcomes of CBA interventions are unlikely to support pro-poor development.

AB  - Here we present the development and characterization of a flexible implantable neural probe with glassy carbon electrode arrays. The use of carbon electrodes allows for these devices to be used as chemical sensors, in addition to their typical use as electrical sensors and stimulators. The devices are fabricated out of polyimide, platinum, titanium, and carbon with standard microfabrication techniques on carrier wafers. The devices are released from the substrate through either chemical or electrochemical dissolution of the underlying substrate material. The glassy carbon electrode arrays are produced through the pyrolysis of SU-8 pillars at 900 °C as the first process step, as this temperature is incompatible with the other device materials. The process demonstrated here is generally applicable, allowing for the integration of various high temperature materials into flexible devices.

AB  - Influenza is occasionally complicated by CNS disorders, in particular impairment of consciousness. Severe disorders encompass multiple, distinct syndromes manifesting acute encephalopathy, whereas mild disorders represent multiple, ill-defined neuropsychiatric syndromes. Acute encephalopathy is manifested with seizures and coma, with or without multi-organ involvement. The outcome varies from death or neurologic sequelae to recovery and differs among syndromes. Transient neuropsychiatric disorders are manifested with delirium and/or abnormal behavior. There also are multiple syndromes. The outcome is usually favorable, although occasional fatal accidents warrant caution.

AB  - Abstract.? ?Objectives: Because the trigone is a unique region in the caudal bladder with a higher risk of neoplasia, we hypothesized that this area would have a high proportion of progenitor cells. As yet there is no marker nor methodology to specifically isolate urothelial stem cells, and thus demonstrate multi-potential differentiation and self-renewal. Here, our goal was to evaluate the distribution of progenitor cells that carry two general major attributes of stem cells: clonogenicity and proliferative capacity. Materials and methods: The bladders of Fisher rats were divided into caudal and cephalic segments and primary cultures were established from the harvested urothelial cells. Results: We found that colony-forming efficiency was almost 2-fold higher for cells from the caudal bladder compared to the cephalic bladder. Doubling time was significantly faster for cells harvested from the caudal bladder at initial plating. This suggested that the caudal bladder harbours a higher density of urothelial progenitor cells. With passage to p4, the differences between the upper and lower bladder were lost, suggesting selection of proliferative cells with serial passage. Based on Ki-67 staining, there was no geographical difference in cell proliferation under normal homeostatic in vivo conditions. Conclusions: These results demonstrate geographical sequestration of urothelial progenitor cells to the area of the bladder that encompasses the bladder neck and trigone, which may be a factor in pathological disparities between the trigone and remaining bladder.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Normal radiographic anatomy of the juvenile donkey foot has not been reported previously. Objectives To provide a radiographic survey of the anatomical development of the donkey foot from 0 to 2 years of age. Study design Radiographic survey. Methods The right front foot of 9 donkey foals born in the spring of 2012, housed and fed in the same conditions, were radiographed every month for the first 6 months of age and every 3 months for the following 18 months. Latero-medial radiographs with and without barium markers at the coronary band and anterior-posterior radiographs of both front feet were obtained during weightbearing. Radiographs were obtained at 55?kV and 3?mAs with mobile x-ray equipment (Gierth RHF 200?ML, Examion DR810). Results The distal physis of the metacarpus (McIII) was closed at the mean age of 17.8 months (SD: 11.5, 21). The proximal physis of the proximal phalanx was closed at the mean age of 15.5 months (SD: 11.5, 21). The distal physis appeared as a clear radiolucent line at 2 weeks of age and was still visible subtly at 24 months. The proximal physis of the middle phalanx was closed at the mean age of 10.7 months (SD: 11.5, 19). The distal physis was visible at birth but closed at 4 days. Conclusions Based on our results, it seems that physes close at an older age in the donkey foal than in the horse. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Ethics committee of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium. (VUB/14-272-2). Owners gave informed consent for their horses' inclusion in the study. Source of funding:?The authors acknowledge Vtrade Belgium for the logistic assistance. Competing interests:?None declared.
