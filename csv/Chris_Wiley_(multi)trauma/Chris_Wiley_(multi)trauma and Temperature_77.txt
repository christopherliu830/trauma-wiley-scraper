AB  - Abstract Objective? To evaluate the cardiopulmonary effects of sufentanil long acting (SLA) in sevoflurane-anaesthetized dogs. Study Design? Randomized prospective study. Animals? Forty female dogs (beagles) aged 1?2?years, weighing 11.97?±?1.40?kg. Materials and methods? The dogs were divided into five groups of eight. Two control groups were used: group A received intramuscular (IM), SLA (50??g?kg?1) alone, while group B received the SLA vehicle followed by sevoflurane anaesthesia for 90?minutes. In the other groups, SLA (50??g?kg?1 IM) was given immediately before (group C0), 15?minutes before (group D15) or 30?minutes (group E30) before induction [with intravenous (IV) thiopental] of sevoflurane anaesthesia lasting for 90?minutes. Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, respiratory rate (fr), arterial oxygen haemoglobin saturation and end-tidal sevoflurane concentration (Fe?SEVO) were measured every 10?minutes during anaesthesia and at 2, 4 and 24?hours after induction (not Fe?SEVO). Acid?base and blood gas analyses were performed. Results? Sufentanil LA reduced heart rate and increased arterial CO2 tensions during anaesthesia. Respiratory depression was least in group E30 compared with groups C0 and D15. Bradycardia was present for at least 24?hours. Respiratory rate was least in group B although arterial O2 and CO2 tension values were acceptable up to 24?hours after anaesthesia. Conclusions? Pre-anaesthetic medication with SLA moderately aggravated the cardiopulmonary effects of sevoflurane. Clinical relevance? In spite of a moderate depressant effect on cardiorespiratory parameters, SLA may be of use as pre-anaesthetic medication before sevoflurane anaesthesia in dogs. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation may occasionally be necessary.

AB  - Objective: To review the clinical utility of blinking and the release reflexes, palmomental, glabellar, grasp, and snout, as an important part of the bedside neurological examination. Design: Articles published from 1966 to 1993 that addressed blinking or the release reflexes were identified by searching the MEDLINE database. Thirty-seven references provided clinically useful and applicable information. Results: There is controversy regarding the optimal method of clinical elicitation of these reflexes. The release reflexes are frequently seen as an incidental abnormality in the elderly. A positive grasp reflex, especially if asymmetrical, is sensitive but not specific for abnormal brain function. Lack of habituation is more important than the mere presence or absence of a reflex. The brainstem circuits involved in the regulation of blinking and the release reflexes are discussed, as are their abnormalities in a variety of clinical settings. Conclusion: Blinking and the release reflexes have clinical utility in the diagnosis and bedside clinical assessment of diseases as diverse as frontal lobe lesions, hydrocephalus, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, falls in the elderly, ageing, HIV-encephalopathy, schizophrenia, tumors in the region of the sylvian aqueduct and recovery from head trauma.

AB  - SUMMARY Using two types of infrared anaesthetic analysers (Capnomac, Datex, Finland and Anaesthetic Gas Monitor [AGM] 1304, Bruel & Kjaer, Denmark) simultaneous measurements were made of halothane and methane concentrations in the expired gases from nine anaesthetised horses. Methane concentrations varied from 232 to 1770 ppm. The Capnomac gave halothane readings 0.35 to 4.5 per cent higher than those given by the other analyser. A highly significant linear relationship (r = 0.87) was found between this difference and the concentration of methane in the anaesthetic circuit. This linear relationship was confirmed by an in vitro study using methane-air mixtures containing approximately 500 to 2,500 ppm of methane and analysed in both the halothane and isoflurane measuring modes of the analysers. The AGM 1304 was totally unaffected by methane. We concluded that monitors with absorption in the upper end of the infrared spectrum are preferable for measuring the concentration of inhalation agents in low-flow anaesthetic systems.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the efficacy of meloxicam or tolfenamic acid administered preoperatively and postoperatively (five days in total) to cats undergoing surgical fracture repair. Methods: Eighty-eight otherwise healthy cats were matched according to fracture site and then randomly allocated to one of two groups, receiving 0·2 mg/kg meloxicam by subcutaneous injection (group M) or 1·5 to 3 mg/kg tolfenamic acid orally (group T) before anaesthesia. Analgesia was continued with 0.05 mg/kg oral meloxicam once daily or 1·5 to 3 mg/kg oral tolfenamic acid twice daily for four days postoperatively. Pain was assessed by a blinded observer using visual analogue scales and a functional limb score. The drug administrator assessed feed intake and palatability of the treatment. Results: Data from 66 cats were analysed. Visual analogue scale pain scores and functional limb scores decreased over time in both groups but were not significantly different between treatments. Feed intake was similar in both groups. Meloxicam was significantly more palatable than tolfenamic acid on all treatment days. Clinical Significance: Meloxicam and tolfenamic acid demonstrated comparable analgesia, without clinically observable side effects. Meloxicam may be associated with superior compliance in clinical practice due to the higher palatability and once daily treatment resulting in better ease of administration.

AB  - Objectives: Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) can be difficult to diagnose. Histopathology is considered the gold standard test but immunohistochemistry (IHC) is mandatory to confirm/exclude the disease. This study aimed to assess the performances of tests carried out in vivo or at postmortem examination in challenging cases in which FIP was confirmed or excluded based on IHC or on adequate follow-up. Methods: Twelve cases (four without FIP, eight with FIP) were retrospectively studied. Clinical findings, serum protein electrophoresis (SPE), analysis of the effusions (AE), antifeline coronavirus serology, serum concentration of α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and histopathology were classified as consistent, doubtful or non-consistent with FIP. Sensitivity, specificity and concordance (?) with the final diagnosis were calculated. Results: Concordance was absent for serology (?=?0·08) and AE (?=?0·52), poor for histopathology (?=0·09), fair for SPE (?=0·25) and perfect for AGP (?=1·00). Sensitivity was high for AGP (100%) and low for AE (50%), SPE (37·5%) and histopathology (37·5%). Specificity was high for AGP or histopathology (100%) and low for SPE (50%) and AE (0%). Clinical Significance: IHC must always be performed to confirm FIP. If this is not possible, when histopathology is controversial, elevated AGP concentrations may support the diagnosis of FIP.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The objective was to study the variation in pediatric emergency department (PED) practice patterns for evaluation and management of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) and fever in U.S. children's hospitals. Methods A cross-sectional study of visits by children 3 months to 18 years of age with SCD and fever evaluated in 36 U.S. children's hospital PEDs within the 2010 Pediatric Health Information System database. The main outcome measures were the proportions of SCD visits that received evaluation (laboratory testing and chest radiographs [CXRs]) and treatment (parenteral administration of antibiotics) and were admitted for fever. Results Of the 4,853 PED visits for SCD and fever, 91.7% had complete blood counts (CBCs), 93.8% had reticulocyte counts, 93% had blood cultures obtained, 68.5% had CXRs, and 91.7% received antibiotics. Most (81.4%) patients received the recommended National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute evaluation (CBC, reticulocyte count, and blood culture) and treatment (parenteral antibiotics). In multivariate regression modeling controlling for hospital- and patient-level effects, age groups ≥1 to <5 years (odds ratio [OR] = 0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.25 to 0.40) and ≥5 to <13 years (OR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.32 to 0.50), and those visits that did not have CXRs had lower odds of hospital admission. After adjusting for age, payor status, receipt of laboratory testing, antibiotics, and CXRs, admission rates varied by sevenfold across U.S. children's hospitals (p < 0.001). Conclusions Standardization of practice exists across children's hospitals regarding obtaining laboratory studies and administering antibiotics for patients with SCD and fever. However, admission rates vary significantly. Evaluating the causes and consequences of such significant variation needs further exploration to improve the quality of care for patients with SCD.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes loss of neurological function and, depending upon the severity of injury, may lead to paralysis. Currently, no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy is available for SCI. High-dose methylprednisolone is widely used, but this treatment is controversial. We have previously shown that low doses of estrogen reduces inflammation, attenuates cell death, and protects axon and myelin in SCI rats, but its effectiveness in recovery of function is not known. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate whether low doses of estrogen in post-SCI would reduce inflammation, protect cells and axons, and improve locomotor function during the chronic phase of injury. Injury (40 g.cm force) was induced at thoracic 10 in young adult male rats. Rats were treated with 10 or 100 ?g 17?-estradiol (estrogen) for 7 days following SCI and compared with vehicle-treated injury and laminectomy (sham) controls. Histology (H&E staining), immunohistofluorescence, Doppler laser technique, and Western blotting were used to monitor tissue integrity, gliosis, blood flow, angiogenesis, the expression of angiogenic factors, axonal degeneration, and locomotor function (Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan rating) following injury. To assess the progression of recovery, rats were sacrificed at 7, 14, or 42 days post injury. A reduction in glial reactivity, attenuation of axonal and myelin damage, protection of cells, increased expression of angiogenic factors and microvessel growth, and improved locomotor function were found following estrogen treatment compared with vehicle-treated SCI rats. These results suggest that treatment with a very low dose of estrogen has significant therapeutic implications for the improvement of locomotor function in chronic SCI. Experimental studies with low dose estrogen therapy in chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) demonstrated the potential for multi-active beneficial outcomes that could ameliorate the degenerative pathways in chronic SCI as shown in (a). Furthermore, the alterations in local spinal blood flow could be significantly alleviated with low dose estrogen therapy. This therapy led to the preservation of the structural integrity of the spinal cord (b), which in turn led to the improved functional recovery as shown (c).

AB  - Abstract History? Ten dogs weighing 36 (21.4?75)?kg [median (min?max)] and aged 3 (1?9)?years scheduled for orthopedic surgery involving the stifle and structures distal to it. Physical Examination? Patients were classified as ASA I or II based on physical examination and basic hematology and biochemistry. Management? Each dog was managed using combined femoral and sciatic nerve blocks and procedural sedation with an intravenous infusion of propofol (0.07?0.15?mg?kg?1?minute?1) and dexmedetomidine (1??g?kg?1?hour?1). None of the patients required conversion to general anesthesia as a result of response to surgical stimulation. The level of sedation was considered adequate in all patients and was characterized by occasional head lifting, thoracic limb stretching, yawning, lingual movements and swallowing. The eye position ranged from central to partial ventromedial rotation and was accompanied by spontaneous blinking. Intra-operative cardiovascular and ventilatory variables were considered within acceptable limits. Muscle relaxation at the surgical field was adequate and surgical conditions were indistinguishable from those produced by general anesthesia. Intraoperatively, no additional analgesics were considered necessary. The quality of the recoveries was considered excellent in all cases. Follow up? No additional pain relief was required in any of the dogs within the 10?hours following blockade. All dogs ate 5.5 (3.5?12)?hours after recovery. Ambulation occurred at 4 (2?6)?hours. No evidence of esophagitis or aspiration pneumonitis has been reported during a period of 1?year after the procedures in any of the dogs. Conclusion? When combined with femoral and sciatic nerve blocks, procedural sedation has the potential of being an alternative to general anesthesia for orthopedic surgery involving the stifle and structures distal to it in the dog.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare an estimate of blood loss obtained using measurements from the Hemocue photometer with a standard estimate in dogs undergoing spinal surgery. Study design? Prospective clinical study. Animals? Twenty-nine client-owned dogs. Methods? During surgery, blood and all lavage fluids were collected in the suction container and on to swabs. To prevent blood clot formation in the suction container, 10?mL citrate-phosphate dextrose adenine (CPDA) was added. At the end of the procedure, the total volume in the suction container was recorded. It was shaken to ensure uniformity and a 5 mL sample tested with the HemoCue photometer. Blood loss in the suction container was calculated as follows: Blood in suction (mL)?=?volume in bottle (mL)???[suction haemoglobin (Hb) concentration (g?dL?1)/pre-operative Hb concentration (g dL?1)]. This volume was added to the estimated volume of blood on the swabs (weight of soaked swabs minus that of dry swabs) to provide the Hemocue estimate of total blood loss. A standard haemorrhage estimate was performed using the volume of fluid in the suction container at the end of surgery in excess of the total volume of lavage fluid available, minus 10?mL CPDA. This volume was added to the estimated volume of blood on the swabs to provide the standard estimate of total blood loss. Data were analyzed with a paired t-test. Retrospective power calculations demonstrated an 80% power to detect a mean difference of 25?mL between the two methods with a level of significance of 0.05. Results? There was no significant difference in calculated blood loss between the two methods (p?=?0.8, mean difference: ?2?mL, 95% CI: ?20 to 16?mL). Conclusions and clinical relevance? The HemoCue may be used to help estimate blood loss in dogs undergoing spinal surgery.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective: To determine whether alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) in near-lethal hyperkalemia either lowers potassium (K) rapidly or shortens duration of cardiac conduction disturbances. Methods: A controlled canine laboratory investigation of 3 treatments for severe hyperkalemia. Conditioned dogs (n = 8; 17?30 kg) received, in random order, 2 mmol/kg of each of 3 treatments (matched in sodium and water) in separate experiments ≥1 week apart: 1.05% NaHCO3 over 60 minutes (infusion therapy); 8.4% NaHCO3 over 5 minutes, then 14 mL/kg sterile water over 55 minutes (bolus therapy); 8.4% NaCl over 5 minutes, then 14 mL/kg sterile water over 55 minutes (saline therapy). Prior to administering one of the above therapies, the animals were anesthetized with 0.5?2.5% isoflurane and ventilated to maintain a normal Pco2. After 30 minutes of equilibration, 2 mmol/kg/hr (loading dose) of a 2-mmol/mL KCl solution was given until idioventricular or relative junctional bradycardic dysrhythmias were sustained for 15 minutes. Then KCl was decreased to 1 mmol/kg/hr (maintenance dose) for 2 hours and 45 minutes. Treatment was begun after 45 minutes of maintenance KCl infusion. Results: The pretreatment K level (all studies) was 9.06 ± 0.82 mmol/L (mean ± SD). Although the mean K level decreased more after saline therapy than after bolus therapy at every time, differences were neither statistically significant nor clinically important during the first 30 minutes. The means of the differences in decreases (saline minus bolus) were small, 0.26 (95% CI, -0.48 to 1.00) at 15 minutes, 0.16 (95% CI, -0.67 to 0.98) at 30 minutes. Dysrhythmia duration was shorter with bolus therapy than for saline therapy in only 1 of 5 dogs (p = 0.38). Conclusions: Hypertonic saline bolus lowered plasma K as effectively as NaHCO3 bolus in this animal model within the first 30 minutes. Clinically meaningful decreases due to alkalinization alone within 30 minutes are unlikely.

AB  - There is a recent trend to feed pet dogs and cats in Britain and other developed countries on raw meat and animal by-products using either commercial preparations or home recipes. This shift from heat-treated processed food has been driven by perceived health benefits to pets and a suspicion of industrially produced pet food. The diets of wild-living related species have been used as a rationale for raw feeding, but differences in biology and lifestyle impose limitations on such comparisons. Formal evidence does exist for claims by raw-feeding proponents of an altered intestinal microbiome and (subjectively) improved stool quality. However, there is currently neither robust evidence nor identified plausible mechanisms for many of the wide range of other claimed benefits. There are documented risks associated with raw feeding, principally malnutrition (inexpert formulation and testing of diets) and infection affecting pets and/or household members. Surveys in Europe and North America have consistently found Salmonella species in a proportion of samples, typically of fresh-frozen commercial diets. Another emerging issue concerns the risk of introducing antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Raw pet food commonly exceeds hygiene thresholds for counts of Enterobacteriaceae. These bacteria often encode resistance to critically important antibiotics such as extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and raw-fed pets create an elevated risk of shedding such resistant bacteria. Other infectious organisms that may be of concern include Listeria, shiga toxigenic E scherichia coli , parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii and exotic agents such as the zoonotic livestock pathogen Brucella suis, recently identified in European Union and UK raw pet meat imported from Argentina.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Inflammation is key in the development of post operative ileus in rodents, with a similar pathogenesis likely occurring in other species. Dexamethasone reduces inflammation and therefore could help reduce post operative ileus in the horse. Objectives To determine if dexamethasone reduces post operative ileus in horses with small intestinal disease, and assess the effect on incisional health and short-term survival. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Fifteen horses that underwent small intestinal resection and anastomosis were given 0.1?mg/kg bwt dexamethasone intravenously during surgery (DEX). Data from a comparable number of horses that did not receive dexamethasone (NoDEX) was collected retrospectively and sequentially. Horses were matched for the type of resection performed. Fisher's Exact and Student's t tests were used for data analysis. Results There was no significant difference in the amount of nasogastric reflux (litres) (DEX 8.06?±?17.12, NoDEX 10.02?±?24.03, P?=?0.39) produced or in the number of horses that produced nasogastric reflux post operatively. There was no difference in survival to discharge. The severity of incisional discharge/infection was significantly different between groups when scored 0?3 (0 being no discharge and 3 being severe discharge/infection), (P?=?0.01), in favour of DEX (2/15 horses affected) vs. NoDEX (7/15). Conclusions Dexamethasone did not appear to have a beneficial effect on the incidence of post-operative ileus. Administration of a single dose of dexamethasone does not appear to have a detrimental effect on short-term survival or on incisional complications.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Infiltrative disease of the intestine is an important cause of weight loss in the horse. Infiltration of inflammatory or neoplastic cells into the intestinal wall and intestinal fibrosis cause changes in the integrity of the intestinal wall. This may lead to altered intestinal permeability which can be measured using the contrast medium iohexol. Objectives To determine if iohexol intestinal permeability, as evaluated by serum iohexol concentration, could be used to differentiate between healthy horses and horses with infiltrative disease of the large colon. Study design Prospective non-randomised controlled clinical trial. Methods Six healthy adult horses and 4 horses with chronic infiltrative disease of the large colon were used in the study. Infiltrative disease was confirmed on post mortem in all cases, and included alimentary lymphoma and mycobacterial granulomatous enterocolitis. Following a 16-h fast, each horse was dosed with 1.0?ml/kg bwt of iohexol as a 10% solution via nasogastric intubation. Blood samples were collected at 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420 and 480?min after dosing. Iohexol concentration was determined using HPLC-UV and the differences between the groups were analysed with a repeated measures ANOVA. Results There was a statistically significant difference in iohexol serum concentration between the diseased and nondiseased horses (P?=?0.001). The overall difference in the mean iohexol concentration between the 2 groups was 6.07 (95% CI 3.19?8.96)??g/ml, however there appeared to be a trend towards increasing difference at later time points (240, 300, 360?min). Conclusions The iohexol permeability test has potential as a diagnostic tool for estimation of intestinal permeability in horses with infiltrative intestinal disease. Further studies are warranted to determine whether the test can be used to determine the site of intestinal pathology, predict the prognosis and potentially evaluate the response to treatment.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There are limited data surrounding the efficacy of oviductal flushing in restoring fertility in mares with repeated returns to oestrus. Objectives To determine the conception and foaling rates in mares treated by laparoscopic topical application of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to the oviduct(s) in mares: i) in the breeding season (January?May), pre-covering; ii) in the breeding season, post covering; and iii) out of the breeding season (June?December). Study design Follow-up study. Methods Analysis of electronic patient records (EPRs) identified 29 mares that underwent oviductal flushing via laparoscopic surgery between 1 January 2008 and 12 October 2014. One mare underwent the procedure twice; once in the breeding season (pre-covering) and once out of the breeding season. Follow-up data were collected via EPRs and from Weatherbys (www.bloodstockreports.co.uk). Results The procedure was used in 27 Thoroughbreds, one Warmblood and one Hanoverian. Mean age at the time of the procedure was 13.1 years (range 6?22 years). Mean duration barren prior to the procedure was 1.9 years (range 49 days?5.6 years). The mean time post flushing to the first positive ultrasound scan was 31 days, with average time post flushing to foaling of 367.6 days. Of the 29 horses, 55.2% (16/29) conceived successfully, with 87.5% of these confirmed to have produced a live foal. In the breeding season, 16 mares were treated; 10 pre-covering, and 6 post covering with conception rates of 60.0% and 83.3%, respectively. Thirteen mares were treated out of the breeding season, with a 35.7% conception rate. Conclusions Oviductal flushing within the breeding season was more successful in this study than flushing performed out of the breeding season. Restoration of fertility in this study was lower than that previously reported and potential reasons for this include limited pre-surgical diagnostic testing, differing prior pathologies or reasons for sub-fertility, and case selection.

AB  - Reasons for performing study While open reduction and internal fixation is the treatment of choice for most ulnar fractures conservative treatment is sometimes chosen due to financial constraints. Additional motives for the choice of treatment may be present, and the clients perception is therefore of interest. Objectives To compare survival and outcome between horses treated for an ulnar fracture, either surgically or conservatively and to assess clients perception of treatment. Study design Retrospective study. Methods Medical records and radiographs of horses treated between January 2002 and December 2012, with a diagnosis of ulnar fracture were reviewed. Information regarding short- (within 1 year) and long-term (>1 year) outcome and owner satisfaction with treatment was obtained via telephone questionnaires. Differences between groups were investigated using a chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Results Fracture types included 11 type 4, 7 type 5, one type 2, and one type 1b fracture. Eleven horses were treated surgically (Group 1). Nine horses were managed conservatively (Group 2). Group 1: 7/11 (64%) survived >1 year, 5/11 (45%) returned to previous athletic level. In Group 2: 6/9 (67%) survived >1 year, 4/9 (43%) returned to previous athletic level. No significant difference in outcome could be detected. There was no difference in the total treatment cost for horses that stayed at the hospital (P?=?0.22). Owners in Group 1 expressed more satisfaction with the treatment than owners in Group 2. Several of the latter expressed welfare concerns regarding the prolonged stall confinement in harness involved with this treatment. Conclusions Veterinarians recommending therapy for cases of ulnar fractures should be aware that many can be treated surgically with a good outcome. Prolonged hospitalisation and stall confinement of horses treated conservatively was a major welfare concern of the owners interviewed and had the same total cost as surgical treatment.
