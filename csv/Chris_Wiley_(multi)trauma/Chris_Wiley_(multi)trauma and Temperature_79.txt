AB  - Abstract Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of magnetization transfer on multislice T1 and T2 measurements of articular cartilage. Materials and Methods A set of phantoms with different concentrations of collagen and contrast agent (Gd-DTPA2?) were used for the in vitro study. A total of 20 healthy knees were used for the in vivo study. T1 and T2 measurements were performed using fast-spin-echo inversion-recovery (FSE-IR) sequence and multi-spin-echo (MSE) sequence, respectively, in both in vitro and in vivo studies. We investigated the difference in T1 and T2 values between that measured by single-slice acquisition and that measured by multislice acquisition. Results Regarding T1 measurement, a large drop of T1 in all slices and also a large interslice variation in T1 were observed when multislice acquisition was used. Regarding T2 measurement, a substantial drop of T2 in all slices was observed; however, there was no apparent interslice variation when multislice acquisition was used. Conclusion This study demonstrated that the adaptation of multislice acquisition technique for T1 measurement using FSE-IR methodology is difficult and its use for clinical evaluation is problematic. In contrast, multislice acquisition for T2 measurement using MSE was clinically applicable if inaccuracies caused by multislice acquisition were taken into account. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Abstract: Revolutionary advances in tissue engineering are redefining approaches to tissue repair and transplantation through the creation of replacement tissues that remain biointeractive after implantation, imparting physiologic functions as well as structure to the tissue or organ damaged by disease or trauma.1,2 Over the last decade this field has moved from ?science fiction? to ?science fact? with the research-oriented acceptance of its potential to regulatory approvals allowing commercial products to be available for use in many countries. The maintenance of tissue integrity, functionality, and viability from cell seeding through product manufacture, shipping, and end-use has been accomplished through innovations in design and scale-up of both tissue growth and preservation processes. These unique systems have enabled the delivery of tissue-engineered products that are uniform inter- and intra-lot, readily available as off-the-shelf products, easy to use, and efficacious. Skin replacement products are the most advanced, with several tissue-engineered wound care materials on the market in the U.S. and in several international communities.3-5 The potential impact of this field is far broader, offering novel solutions to the medical field for drug screening and development, genetic engineering, and total tissue and organ replacement.

AB  - Summary Preeclampsia and eclampsia have the potential to produce significant maternal and fetal complications. This chapter addresses therapy for pregnant women with chronic hypertension and focuses on pharmacologic management that may diminish risk of superimposed preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is sometimes manifested by severe systemic hypertension. Careful control of hypertension must be achieved to prevent complications, such as maternal cerebral vascular accidents and placental abruption. Pregnancy-related blindness has been associated with eclampsia, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and hypertensive encephalopathy. Thrombosis and vasospasm develop and lead to multi-organ involvement, including renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, and uteroplacental dysfunction. Unlike most forms of preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome is not primarily a disease of primigravidas. The clinical signs and symptoms of patients with HELLP syndrome are classically related to the impact of vasospasm on the maternal liver. Thus, most patients present with signs or symptoms of liver compromise.

AB  - Summary The anesthesia of caged of birds is unique not only from the aspect of anatomy and physiology, but also due to unique requirements for anesthetic equipment, monitoring, and species-specific pharmacology. The medical history and husbandry of the pet bird is essential for preanesthetic evaluation. Body temperature is monitored continuously throughout anesthesia. Appropriate means of physical restraint must be assessed for each patient and appropriate stabilization and supportive care prepared prior to handling. Sedatives and tranquilizers are used to decrease anxiety and fear during induction. However, most tranquilizers lack analgesia. Injectable anesthetics are more commonly used in the field due to the ease of transport compared with inhalant anesthetic delivery equipment. Birds may be more sensitive to the toxic effects of local anesthetics than mammals. Due to the rapid rate at which birds may decompensate under anesthesia, monitoring is the most important aspect of avian anesthesia body weight.

AB  - Abstract We have previously shown complement activation as a possible mechanism for trichloroethylene (TCE) sensitization, leading to multi-organ damage including the kidneys. In particular, excessive deposition of C5 and C5b-9-the membrane attack complex, which can generate significant tissue damage, was observed in the kidney tissue after TCE sensitization. The present study tested the hypothesis that anaphylatoxin C5a binding to its receptor C5aR mediates renal injury in TCE-sensitized BALB/c mice. BALB/c mice were sensitized through skin challenge with TCE, with or without pretreatment by the C5aR antagonist W54011. Kidney histopathology and the renal functional test were performed to assess renal injury, and immunohistochemistry and fluorescent labeling were carried out to assess C5a and C5aR expressions. TCE sensitization up-regulated C5a and C5aR expressions in kidney tissue, generated inflammatory infiltration, renal tubule damage, glomerular hypercellularity and impaired renal function. Antagonist pretreatment blocked C5a binding to C5aR and attenuated TCE-induced tissue damage and renal dysfunction. TCE sensitization also caused the deposition of major pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-? in the kidney tissue (P?<?0.05); this was accompanied by increased expression of P-p38, P-ERK and P-JNK proteins (P?<?0.05). Pretreatment with the C5aR antagonist attenuated the increase of expression of P-p38, P-ERK and P-JNK proteins (P?<?0.05) and also consistently reduced the TCE sensitization-induced increase of IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-? (P?<?0.05). These data identify C5a binding to C5aR, MAP kinase activation, and inflammatory cytokine release as a novel mechanism for complement-mediated renal injury by sensitization with TCE or other environmental chemicals.

AB  - ABSTRACT Ischemic brain injury is one of the most important causes of death worldwide. The use of one-drug-multi-target agents based on natural compounds is a promising therapeutic option for cerebral ischemia due to their pleiotropic properties. This study assessed the neuroprotective properties of Castanea sativa Mill. bark extract (ENC) in human astrocytoma U-373 MG cells subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion and rat cortical slices subjected to ischemia-like conditions or treated with glutamate or hydrogen peroxide. Neuroprotective effects were determined by assessing cells or slices viability (MTT assay), ROS formation (DCFH-DA assay), apoptosis (sub G0/G1 peak), nuclear fragmentation and chromatin condensation (DAPI staining) as well as changes in lysosomes and mitochondria morphology (Acridine Orange and Rhodamine123 staining, respectively). ENC treatment before injury on U-373 MG cells (5?50??g/ml) and cortical slices (50?100??g/ml) provided neuroprotection, while lower or higher concentrations (100??g/ml U-373 MG cells, 200??g/ml brain slices) were ineffective. ENC addition during reperfusion or after the injury was not found to be effective. The results suggest that ENC might hold potential as preventive neuroprotective agent, and indicate the importance of further studies exploring its mechanism of action. J. Cell.

AB  - Abstract The Scientific Opinion on the welfare of animals during transport reviewed the most recent scientific information concerning the main farm species. New scientific evidence and consequent conclusions and recommendations were arranged following the structure of Annex I of EC Regulation 1/2005 . On fitness for transport, recommendations for cattle and poultry were focused on repeated humane handling and careful inspection prior to transport. On the means of transport, use of partitions in horse transport, compulsory fasting of pigs with provision of water at stops, and temperature limits for poultry were major recommendations. Maintaining stability of animal groups was recommended as good practice, with special emphasis on the need to avoid mixing unfamiliar pigs or goats. On watering and feeding intervals, journey times and resting periods, journey duration should not exceed 12 hours for horses and 29 hours for cattle. Horses should be supplied with water one hour before and one hour after transport, and for cattle there should be a 24 hour recovery period with access to food and water. For rabbits, time spent inside the containers during lairage should be considered journey time. Space allowance for horses should be given in terms of kg/m2 instead of m2/animal. For cattle and sheep, it is recommended that space allowances should be calculated according to an allometric equation relating size to body weight. Limits for stocking densities of broilers in containers should be related to thermal conditions. On the navigation systems, temperature monitoring systems should be incorporated. Minimum standards should be established regarding data type to be recorded, the system and the on-board architecture. Recommendations for further research focused on the thermal limits and regulation for poultry and rabbits, the effects of ventilation on pigs, space allowance for rabbits, newly hatched chicks and pigs, optimal journey times for horses, pigs and calves.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare airway management using the v-gel supraglottic airway device (v-gel SGAD) to that using an endotracheal tube (ETT), with respect to practicability, leakage of volatile anaesthetics and upper airway discomfort in cats. Study design Prospective, randomized clinical trial. Animals Twenty European Shorthair cats (9 males, 11 females), weighing 3.3 ± 0.7 kg. Methods Cats were randomly allocated to one of two groups, in which the airway was managed by either the v-gel SGAD or a cuffed ETT, and anaesthetized for neutering procedures. The dose of propofol necessary to insert the ETT or v-gel SGAD; time from the first injection of propofol to the first clinically acceptable reading on the capnograph; leakage of isoflurane around the airway device; and upper airway discomfort scores during recovery and during the first 24 hours after anaesthesia were recorded. Continuous and discrete variables were analyzed with the Mann?Whitney U-test and the Pearson chi-squared test, respectively. Results were considered statistically significant if p < 0.05. Results Time from the first injection of propofol to the first clinically acceptable reading on the capnograph was significantly shorter in the v-gel group. The ETT group showed significantly more stridor during recovery. No other significant differences were found. Conclusions and clinical relevance Airway management with the v-gel SGAD is a sound and practicable alternative to endotracheal intubation with an ETT. However, larger prospective trials will be needed to draw firm conclusions on the benefits and/or drawbacks of the use of v-gel SGAD for airway management in cats.

AB  - Abstract The paper provides a brief overview of the use of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) in the areas of bone regenerative medicine. Reconstruction of bone defects caused by trauma, non-union, and bone tumor excision, still faces many challenges despite the intense investigations and advancement in bone-tissue engineering and bone regeneration over the past decades. IONPs have promising prospects in this field due to their controlled responsive characteristics in specific external magnetic fields and have been of great interest during the last few years. This Minireview aims to summarize the relevant progress and describes the following five aspects: (i) The general introduction of IONPs, with a focus on the magnetic properties as the base of application; (ii) using IONPs as tools to study and control stem cells for better treatment efficacy in stem-cell-based bone defect repair; (iii) the use of IONPs and their complexes in the delivery of therapeutic agents, including chemical drug molecules, growth factors, and genetic materials, to promote osteogenesis-related cell function and differentiation, healthy bone tissue growth, and functional reconstruction; (iv) magneto-mechanical actuation in the regulation of cells distribution, mechano-transduction membrane receptors activation, and mechanosensitive signaling pathways regulation, and (v) fabrication, characteristics, and in?vitro and in?vivo osteogenic effects of magnetic composite bone scaffolds. Ongoing prospects are also discussed.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the fresh gas flow (FGF) rate requirements for the Humphrey ADE semi-closed breathing system in the Mapleson A mode; to determine the FGF at which rebreathing occurs, and compare the efficiency of this system to the Bain (Mapleson D) system in spontaneously breathing cats and small dogs. Study Design Prospective clinical study. Animals Twenty-five healthy (ASA score I or II) client-owned cats and dogs (mean ± SD age 4.7 ± 5.0 years, and body weight 5.64 ± 3.26 kg) undergoing elective surgery or minor procedures. Methods Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane delivered via the Humphrey ADE system in the A mode using an oxygen FGF of 100 mL kg?1 minute?1. The FGF was then reduced incrementally by 5?10 mL kg?1minute?1 at approximately five-minute intervals, until rebreathing (inspired CO2 >5 mmHg (0.7 kPa)) was observed, after which flow rates were increased. In six animals, once the minimum FGF at which rebreathing occurred was found, the breathing system was changed to the Bain, and the effects of this FGF delivery examined, before FGF was increased. Results Rebreathing did not occur at the FGF recommended by the manufacturer for the ADE. The mean ± SD FGF that resulted in rebreathing was 60 ± 20 mL kg?1minute?1. The mean minimum FGF at which rebreathing did not occur with the ADE was 87 ± 39 mL kg?1minute?1. This FGF resulted in significant rebreathing (inspired CO2 8.8 ± 2.6 mmHg (1.2 ± 0.3 kPa)) on the Bain system. Conclusions The FGF rates recommended for the Humphrey ADE are adequate to prevent rebreathing in spontaneously breathing cats and dogs <15 kg. Clinical relevance The Humphrey ADE system used in the A mode is a more efficient alternative to the Bain system, for maintenance of gaseous anaesthesia in spontaneously breathing cats and small dogs.

AB  - Abstract Bioheat transfer models have significant applications in a wide variety of clinical, basic, and environmental sciences. In particular, understanding the heat transfer in biological tissues is a necessity for many therapeutic practices involving either raising or lowering temperature such as cancer hyperthermia, burn injury, brain hypothermia resuscitation, disease diagnostics, thermal comfort analysis, cryosurgery and cryopreservation, and so on. In this section, aiming to provide a fundamental background for theoretically tackling the above bioengineering issues, an overview on the most basic bioheat transfer model, its extended forms as well as typical applications under various high- or low-temperature situations was summarized. Meanwhile, solutions either analytical or numerical to the bioheat transfer model with or without phase change and particularities for choosing the model parameters were illustrated. Some possible extensions of the classic bioheat transfer model were also discussed.

Summary The disease-based discovery of the molecular basis for autoinflammatory diseases has led not only to a rapidly growing number of clinically and genetically identifiable disorders, but has unmantled key inflammatory pathways such as the potent role of the alarm cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 in human disease. Following its initial failures in the treatment of sepsis and the moderate success in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, IL-1 blocking therapies had a renaissance in the treatment of a number of autoinflammatory conditions, and IL-1 blocking therapies have been Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of the autoinflammatory conditions: cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). CAPS and deficiency of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA), both genetic conditions with molecular defects in the IL-1 pathway, have provided a pathogenic rationale to IL-1 blocking therapies, and the impressive clinical results confirmed the pivotal role of IL-1 in human disease. Furthermore, IL-1 blocking strategies have shown clinical benefit in a number of other genetically defined autoinflammatory conditions, and diseases with clinical similarities to the monogenic disorders and not yet identified genetic causes. The discovery that IL-1 is not only triggered by infectious danger signals but also by danger signals released from metabolically ?stressed? or even dying cells has extended the concept of autoinflammation to disorders such as gout, and those that were previously not considered inflammatory, such as type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, obesity and some degenerative diseases, and provided the conceptual framework to target IL-1 in these diseases. Despite the tremendous success of IL-1 blocking therapy, the use of these agents in a wider spectrum of autoinflammatory conditions has uncovered disease subsets that are not responsive to IL-1 blockade, including the recently discovered proteasome-associated autoinflammatory syndromes such as chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatitis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperatures (CANDLE), Japanese autoinflammatory syndrome with lipodystrophy (JASL), Nakajo?Nishimura syndrome (NNS) and joint contractures, muscle atrophy, panniculitis induced lipodystrophy (JMP), and urge the continued quest to characterize additional dysregulated innate immune pathways that cause autoinflammatory conditions.

AB  - The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used for expressing the genes encoding the ionotropic N-methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits from rats (NR1a, NR2A, NR2C) and mice (NR2B). Four plasmids were constructed by cloning the different NMDA receptor genes in the two multi-copy yeast-Escherichia coli shuttle vectors pMB01 (?NR1a gene) and pMB02 (?NR2A-2C genes). The protease-deficient S. cerevisiae strain cI3-ABYS-86 (leu?, ura?) was transformed or co-transformed with the resulting plasmids pMBNR1a (leu+) or pMBNR1a/pMBNR2A?C (ura+) respectively. Western blotting analysis with antibodies raised against amino acid sequences at the C-termini of the respective subunits revealed that the recombinant receptor proteins were differently expressed and only partially glycosylated in the cell membranes of the recombinant yeast strains. The expression and localization of the recombinant NMDA receptor proteins were also proved by immunofluorescence microscopy which indicated a distinct expression of the different NMDA receptor subunits in the plasma membrane of the transformed yeast cells. Pharmacological characterization of crude membrane preparations of the recombinant yeast cells showed saturable binding of the glycine antagonist [3H]MDL105,519 with Kd values of 56.9?±?6.19?nM (NR1a/NR2A), 26.72?±?2.13?nM (NR1a/NR2B), and 21.22?±?1.64?nM (NR1a/NR2C), and bound capacities of 17.94?±?1.24?pmol/mg membrane protein (NR1a/NR2A), 11.45?±?0.67?pmol/mg (NR1a/NR2B), and 16.15?±?0.86 (NR1a/NR2C) pmol/mg. The [3H]MDL105,519 binding was inhibited by the glycine antagonist 5,7-dichlorokynurenate, ethyl-2-carboxy-4,6-dichloro-3-indoleacetate, and itself, but not by glycine, D-serine or 1-amino-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid. Specific binding of [3H]glycine or the NMDA channel blocker [3H]dizolcipine were not observed.

AB  - Injectable and settable biomaterials are a growing class of therapeutic technologies within the field of regenerative medicine. These materials offer advantages compared to prefabricated implants because of their ability to be utilized as part of noninvasive surgical procedures, fill complex defect shapes, cure in situ, and incorporate cells and other active biologics. However, there are significant technical barriers to clinical translation of injectable and settable biomaterials, such as achieving clinically relevant handling properties and benign reaction conditions. This review focuses on the engineering challenges associated with the design and development of injectable and chemically settable polymeric biomaterials. Additionally, specific examples of the diverse chemistries utilized to overcome these challenges are covered. The future translation of injectable and settable biomaterials is anticipated to improve patient outcomes for a number of clinical conditions. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
