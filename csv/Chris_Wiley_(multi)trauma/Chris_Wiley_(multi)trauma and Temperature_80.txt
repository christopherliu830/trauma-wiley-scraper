AB  - Injectable and settable biomaterials are a growing class of therapeutic technologies within the field of regenerative medicine. These materials offer advantages compared to prefabricated implants because of their ability to be utilized as part of noninvasive surgical procedures, fill complex defect shapes, cure in situ, and incorporate cells and other active biologics. However, there are significant technical barriers to clinical translation of injectable and settable biomaterials, such as achieving clinically relevant handling properties and benign reaction conditions. This review focuses on the engineering challenges associated with the design and development of injectable and chemically settable polymeric biomaterials. Additionally, specific examples of the diverse chemistries utilized to overcome these challenges are covered. The future translation of injectable and settable biomaterials is anticipated to improve patient outcomes for a number of clinical conditions. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Objective? To estimate the incidence of neonatal jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia in a poor urban community in Karachi, where 70% of births occur at home. Methods? Home-based pregnancy and newborn surveillance were conducted from September 2004 to July 2006 in a multi-ethnic population by trained community health workers. Newborns were visited several times at scheduled intervals until 59?days of life; any baby with jaundice was referred to the local clinic. Clinical assessments of jaundice were assigned by a physician and recorded using an adapted Kramer scale. Blood for plasma bilirubin was obtained if parents consented. Results? Of a birth cohort of 1690 young infants during the study period, 466 infants (27.6%) were referred to our centre with jaundice. Of these, 64% were 0-6?days old. Bilirubin was measured in 125 of 466 (27%) jaundiced newborns. Overall detected rate of hyperbilirubinemia (bilirubin >5?mg/dl) among 1690 newborns was 39.7/1000 live births (95% CI 29.3?47.6). Rate of plasma bilirubin levels in the range of 15?20?mg/dl was 13/1000 live births (95% CI 7.6?18.4); levels >20?mg/dl were observed in 3.5/1000 live births (95% CI 0.4?5.5). The proportion of newborns with bilirubin ≥15?mg/dl was significantly higher among those assigned a Kramer score of 4?5 compared to those receiving a score of 1?3 (P-value 0.00004). Conclusion? A significant burden of untreated severe neonatal jaundice, causing potential neurological sequelae, exists in developing countries such as Pakistan. WHO guidelines are needed for screening and appropriate management of neonatal jaundice in developing countries.

AB  - ABSTRACT The clinical findings, laboratory data, ultrastructure, and autopsy findings are reported for four Greyhounds with a myeloproliferative disorder. In all dogs abnormalities were found in the granulocytic, erythroid and megakaryocytic cell lines, resulting in granulocytic leukaemia, impaired erythropoiesis and megakaryocytic dysplasia. The presence in blood of many small platelet producing cells (micromegakaryocytes) led to initial diagnostic confusion in three dogs with two of them suspected of having lymphatic leukaemia. An approach to the diagnosis of myeloproliferative disease, including the awareness of other clinical possibilities, is presented. The significance of the presence of micromegakaryocytes in the peripheral blood stream is discussed with reference to other veterinary reports and similar findings in man.

AB  - Emesis is a common presenting sign in small animal practice. It requires a rational approach to management that is based upon a sound understanding of pathophysiology combined with logical decision making. This review, which assesses the weight of available evidence, outlines the physiology of the vomiting reflex, causes of emesis, the consequences of emesis and the approach to clinical management of the vomiting dog. The applicability of diagnostic testing modalities and the merit of traditional approaches to management, such as dietary changes, are discussed. The role and usefulness of both traditional and novel anti-emetic drugs is examined, including in specific circumstances such as following cytotoxic drug treatment. The review also examines areas in which common clinical practice is not necessarily supported by objective evidence and, as such, highlights questions worthy of further clinical research.

AB  - Abstract The aim of the study was an objective in vivo assessment of skin properties after reconstruction with two artificial dermal substitutes, Integra? and Hyalomatrix?. Twenty-seven patients underwent reconstruction of 36 skin-loss sites with full-thickness skin graft, split-thickness skin graft, Hyalomatrix? bioengineered skin substitute and sequential split-thickness skin graft and Integra? bioengineered skin substitute and sequential split-thickness skin graft. Objective assessments were carried out using three instrumental devices: Multi Probe Adapter System MPA; 22?MHz ultrasound skin scan; and Primos Pico for a three-dimensional (3D) skin scan. The skin parameters under study in our sample were: corneometry, transepidermal water loss, elastometry, colorimetry, skin thickness and 3D skin surface pattern. A skin reconstruction with Hyalomatrix seemed to most closely approach the hydration, transepidermal water loss and skin surface 3D pattern of normal skin. A skin reconstruction with Integra seemed to demonstrate the best skin colour feature and elastic properties. Although no statistically significant differences were observed, the descriptive analysis of the outcomes might suggest a better cell regulation, regenerated extracellular matrix and neoangiogenesis with the use of Hyalomatrix, and the formation of a more elastic regenerated dermis, with overall better physical, mechanical and optical properties, with the use of Integra. ? 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Background The present interdisciplinary consensus review proposes clinical considerations and recommendations for anaesthetic practice in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery with an Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) programme. Methods Studies were selected with particular attention being paid to meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials and large prospective cohort studies. For each item of the perioperative treatment pathway, available English-language literature was examined and reviewed. The group reached a consensus recommendation after critical appraisal of the literature. Results This consensus statement demonstrates that anaesthesiologists control several preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative ERAS elements. Further research is needed to verify the strength of these recommendations. Conclusions Based on the evidence available for each element of perioperative care pathways, the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS ?) Society presents a comprehensive consensus review, clinical considerations and recommendations for anaesthesia care in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery within an ERAS programme. This unified protocol facilitates involvement of anaesthesiologists in the implementation of the ERAS programmes and allows for comparison between centres and it eventually might facilitate the design of multi-institutional prospective and adequately powered randomized trials.

AB  - Abstract Dermal substitutes offer alternative approaches for wounds of all thicknesses where sufficient donation sites are not available for self-grafts. Several dermal substitutes are described in literature. This study included 20 patients treated with a dermal induction template after the removal of malignant skin cancers situated in various parts of the body. The participants were especially aged patients with multiple skin cancers, and complex clinical conditions, often affected by pathologies such as cardiopathy, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolaemia, and receiving pharmacological multi-therapies, particularly antiplatelets and anticoagulants. In many of these patients, the general complex clinical picture provided significant contraindication for complex reconstructive surgery because of the high risk involved. All patients achieved complete healing about 8?weeks after the first surgery. By using a dermal induction template, it was possible to cover substantial loss of substances without the need of autologous tissue, with smoother and less apparent scar, minor occurrence of hypertrophic and retracted scars, better flexibility of healed skin and therefore a better result from an aesthetic point of view.

AB  - Charcoal hemoperfusion is an effective treatment in acute drug intoxication with small volume of distribution. For certain drugs, clearance rates are higher with hemoperfusion than hemodialysis. We describe a patient with severe valproic acid overdose who developed severe hemolysis and acute renal failure related to charcoal hemoperfusion treatment. A 50-year-old female was admitted to the hospital following valproic acid overdose. Initial valproic acid level was 73.6?mg/L, and she was treated with oral activated charcoal. Four hours later she developed mental status changes with valproic acid level at 490.9?mg/L and prolonged QT interval. Charcoal hemoperfusion was started with blood flow rate 400?ml/min. Patient developed bleeding with evidence of severe Before(*C.H.) After (C.H.)

She received transfusion of packed red blood cells, platelets, and fibrin. Over the next few days she developed oligouric acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis for 2 weeks. Eventually hemolysis resolved and the renal function improved (kidney biopsy was consistent with acute tubular necrosis). To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of severe intravascular hemolysis occurring during the charcoal hemoperfusion treatment. Etiology includes mechanical trauma to the red cells, probably related to high blood flow rate through the charcoal column.

AB  - Abstract Aim To report a study protocol of a randomized controlled trial examining if a symptom self-management programme helps patients with acute myocardial infarction self-manage their physical and psychological symptoms. Background In addition to physical conditions, people with acute myocardial infarction often experience psychological symptoms. However, there is limited empirical evidence on how to help individuals self-manage these psychological symptoms. Design A single-blinded, randomized controlled trial is proposed. Methods A convenience sample of 90 will be recruited. Eligible participants will be adult patients with acute myocardial infarction hospitalized at a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups: Intervention 1 and standard care (n = 30), Intervention 2 and standard care (n = 30) and standard care alone (n = 30). Data will be collected by self-reported questionnaires, physiological measures and open-ended questions. Quantitative data will be analysed by descriptive statistics, t-test, analysis of covariance and repeated measures analysis of variance. Open-ended questions will be analysed by content analysis. Discussion This study will identify a potentially efficacious symptom self-management programme for patients with acute myocardial infarction. If the efficacy of the programme is demonstrated, the programme can be integrated into hospital services to improve patient care. A new teaching method (virtual reality?based teaching) and new teaching materials (virtual reality videos and relaxation videos) derived from this study can be offered to patients. Future research with larger samples and multi-centre recruitment can be undertaken to further test the efficacy of the interventions.

AB  - Abstract Dermatopathies are common with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, affecting an estimated 90% of HIV patients. Opportunistic infections are common and include viral, bacterial and fungal etiologies. Dermal eruptions from highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) or antibiotics such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMS) are also common, and can be challenging to differentiate from other causes of dermatitis. Presented is a challenging dermatology case involving a six year old male rhesus macaque experimentally infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Skin cultures identified multi-antibiotic resistant Staphylococcus aureus, with incomplete resolution following appropriate antibiotic treatment. Skin biopsy results indicated non-specific dermatitis not consistent with typical SIV dermatitis and with a hypersensitivity component. Fungal culture revealed aspergillosis, and the patient responded favorably to oral itraconazole therapy.

AB  - ABSTRACT Obiedive: To compare the pharmacokinetics of Tylenol Extended Relief (ER APAP) with those of immediate-release acetaminophen (IR APAP) at supratherapeutic doses. Methods: A prospective, double-blind, randomized, crossover comparison trial involving 14 adult volunteers. Each subject ingested 75 mgkg of either ER APAP or IR APAP and 1 week later received the other APAP preparation. On both occasions plasma APAP concentration ([APAP]) was determined 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 hours after ingestion. The times to maximum [APAP] (Tmax); the maximum [APAP] values (Cmax); the elimination half-lives 4?16 hours postingestion (t1/2), and the areas under the [APAP] vs time curve (AUC) for ER APAP and IR APAP were compared using the paired t-test. Results: All the subjects completed both study phases. The mean APAP dose ingested was 5.6 g (range, 4.2?7.8 g). Both the AUC and the Cmax were less after ER APAP than after IR APAP; otherwise, there was no evident difference in any measure. Graphically, ER APAP yielded a flatter, plateau-shaped curve initially, but after 4 hours the curve was nearly identical to that for IR APAP. Results are summarized in the table: Conclusion: In this model involving a single supratherapeutic dose, ER APAP evidenced no pharmacokinetic features that would suggest the need for an alternate poisoning screening strategy. When compared with IR APAP, ER APAP had a lower AUC, all peak [APAP] occurred in <4 hours, and terminal eliminations were identical. The data suggest that, in most cases, the diagnostic approach to an overdose of ER APAP need not deviate from that used for an IR APAP overdose.

AB  - On behalf of the ?Blood Matters? Planning Group. The Blood Matters Collaborative was structured around a series of specific projects designed to improve distinct aspects of the sequence of care processes that ultimately determine the safety of each and every fresh blood product (red cell, platelet, fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate) transfusion. These commence with the appropriateness of the clinical decision to transfuse blood products, then move to ensure that procedures for patient, sample and blood product identification and blood administration are robust and that any procedural errors and adverse events associated with transfusion are captured, analysed and acted upon. Finally and very importantly the collaborative sought to improve the patient and carers understanding of the risks and benefits of transfusion. It was an ambitious program of work but there seemed little alternative other than addressing all of the interdependent processes that determine the quality and safety of transfusion. All elements in this chain contribute to the actual levels of transfusion safety. With support from the Clinical Innovation Agency and planning group members, local multi-disciplinary hospital teams set out to deliver changes to improve transfusion safety. The collaborative methodology, initially developed by the Institute of Healthcare Improvement in the United States of America, has been adopted and used by a large number of health systems internationally and within Australia. It is based on answering three key questions [Q1. What are we trying to accomplish? Q2. How will we know that a change is an improvement? Q3. What changes can we make that will result in improvement?] and testing ideas through the plan, do, study, act cycles of change. Individual projects monitored progress using ?run charts? to record their measured performance. These indicated progress towards achieving locally set targets and collaborative improvement goals. Our objectives were translated into tangible benefits for patients requiring blood product transfusion. Fundamental to the collaborative approach to improving transfusion practice is the belief that changes can be tested rapidly on a small scale without risk. For example, an idea can quickly be tried with one patient, one clinic or ward, a single consultant or hospital. Only if it proved successful was it suggested for wider adoption as an improvement in care across an entire Health Service or system of care. Our successes reinforced the value of using a systematic method for translating ideas into practice such as that used by the collaborative. The governance structures and teams established during our participation in the collaborative have helped us to identify key local issues and implement strategies to enhance the quality of our transfusion services to our patients. Our aim is to ensure that the continued review and improvement of transfusion practices becomes an integral part of the way that clinical teams and hospital and health system clinical governance structures work. The role of state or national bodies is to support this to happen. We hope to build a series of improvement partnerships that all focus on optimising the quality of transfusion services and the outcomes of patients receiving transfusion during their clinical care.

AB  - Abstract To study the expression level of a panel of pro/anti-apoptotic factors and inflammation-related receptors in chondral fragments from patients undergoing surgical treatment for intra-articular calcaneal fractures, cartilage fragments were retrieved from calcaneal fractures of 20 patients subjected to surgical treatment. Primary cultures were performed using chondral fragments from fractured and control patients. Chondrocyte cultures from each patient of the fractured and control groups were subjected to immunofluorescence staining and quantitatively analyzed under confocal microscopy. Proteins extracted from the cultured chondrocytes taken from the fractured and control groups were processed for Western blot experiments and densitometric analysis. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined using the cleaved PARP-1 antibody. The proportion of labelled cells was 35% for fractured specimens, compared with 7% for control samples. Quantification of caspase-3 active and Bcl-2 proteins in chondrocyte cultures showed a significant increase of the apoptotic process in fractured specimens compared with control ones. Fractured chondrocytes were positively stained for ChemR23 with statistically significant differences with respect to control samples. Densitometric evaluation of the immunoreactive bands confirmed these observations. Human articular chondrocytes obtained from patients with intra-articular calcaneal fractures express higher levels of pivotal pro-apoptotic factors, and of the chemo-attractive receptor ChemR23, compared with control cultures. On the basis of these observations, the authors hypothesize that consistent prolonged chondrocyte death, associated with the persistence of high levels of pro-inflammatory factors, could enhance the deterioration of cartilage tissue with consequent development of post-traumatic arthritis following intra-articular bone fracture.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the accuracy of an oscillometric blood pressure monitor in anesthetized sheep. Study design Prospective study. Animals Twenty healthy adult sheep, 11 males and nine females, weighing 63.6 ± 8.6 kg. Methods After premedication with buprenorphine or transdermal fentanyl, anesthesia was induced with ketamine-midazolam and maintained with isoflurane and ketamine, 1.2 mg kg?1 hour?1, ± lidocaine, 3 mg kg?1 hour?1. Invasive blood pressure measurements were obtained from an auricular arterial catheter and noninvasive measurements were from a cuff on the metatarsus or antebrachium. Simultaneous invasive and noninvasive measurements were recorded over a range (55?111 mmHg) of mean arterial pressures (MAP). Isoflurane concentration was increased to decrease MAP and decreasing the isoflurane concentration and infusing dobutamine achieved higher pressures. Invasive and noninvasive measurements were compared. Results Correlation (R2) was good between the two methods of measurement (average of three consecutive readings) for systolic (SAP) (0.87), diastolic (DAP) (0.86), and mean (0.90) arterial pressures (p < 0.001). Bias ± SD between noninvasive and invasive measurements for SAP was 3 ± 8 mmHg, for DAP was ?10 ± 7 mmHg, and MAP was ?7 ± 6 mmHg. There was no significant difference between the average of three measurements and use of the first measurement. Correlations using the first measurement were SAP (0.82), DAP (0.84), and MAP (0.89). Bias ± SD for SAP was 3 ±10 mmHg, for DAP was ?11 ± 7 mmHg, and MAP was ?7 ± 6 mmHg. The oscillometric monitor slightly overestimated SAP and underestimated DAP and MAP for both average values and the first reading. Conclusions and clinical relevance This oscillometric model provided MAP measurements that were acceptable by ACVIM standards. MAP measurements with this monitor were lower than those found with the invasive technique so a clinical diagnosis of hypotension may be made in sheep that are not hypotensive.

AB  - Abstract Childhood and adolescent rates of obesity and overweight are continuing to increase in much of the world. Risk factors such as diet composition, excess caloric intake, decreased exercise, genetics, and the built environment are active areas of etiologic research. The obesogen hypothesis, which postulates that prenatal and perinatal chemical exposure can contribute to risk of childhood and adolescent obesity, remains relatively underexamined. This review surveys numerous classes of chemicals for which this hypothesis has been explored. We focus on human data where they exist and also discuss the findings of rodent and cell culture studies. Organochlorine chemicals as well as several classes of chemicals that are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists are identified as possible risk factors for obesity. Recommendations for future epidemiologic and experimental research on the chemical origins of obesity are also given. Mt Sinai J Med 78:22?48, 2011. ? 2011 Mount Sinai School of Medicine
