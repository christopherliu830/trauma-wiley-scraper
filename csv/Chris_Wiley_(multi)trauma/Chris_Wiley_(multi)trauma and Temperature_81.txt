AB  - Abstract Objective To assess if positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration improves gas exchange and respiratory mechanics, without hemodynamic impairment in horses during anesthesia. Design Prospective, randomized study. Animals Thirteen isoflurane-anesthetized healthy horses. Methods After 60 minutes of anesthesia with spontaneous breathing, mechanical ventilation was initiated with an inspiratory-expiratory ratio of 1:2, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, tidal volume of 10?20 mL kg?1 and respiratory rate adjusted to maintain normocapnia. Constant PEEP of 5 cmH2O was continued (control group; n = 6) or titrated (PEEP group; n = 7) by increasing and decreasing PEEP from 5 to 20 cmH2O at 15-minute intervals. The horses were instrumented with an arterial catheter to measure blood pressure and allow collection of blood for pH and blood gas analysis and a Swan-Ganz catheter for measurement of cardiac output (CO) using thermodilution. Cardiopulmonary assessment was recorded before PEEP titration and after 15 minutes at each PEEP value. Results In the PEEP group, static compliance (range) (Cst 278?463 mL cmH2O?1) was significantly higher and the shunt fraction ( 7?20%) and the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference [P(A-a)O2 95?325 mmHg] were significantly lower than in the control group [Cst of 246?290 mL cmH2O?1, of 16?19%, P(A-a)O2 of 253?310 mmHg; p < 0.05]. CO (mean ± SEM) was lower in the PEEP group (23 ± 2 L minute?1) at 20 cmH2O PEEP than in the control group (26 ± 4 L minute?1, p < 0.05), with no significant changes in heart rate, blood pressure or central venous pressure. Conclusions PEEP titration significantly improved gas exchange and lung compliance, with a small decrease in CO at the highest PEEP level. Clinical relevance Gas exchange and respiratory mechanics impairment during inhalation anesthesia can be treated using PEEP titration from 5 to 20 cmH2O, without clinically important hemodynamic effects in healthy horses.

AB  - Abstract Childhood and adolescent rates of obesity and overweight are continuing to increase in much of the world. Risk factors such as diet composition, excess caloric intake, decreased exercise, genetics, and the built environment are active areas of etiologic research. The obesogen hypothesis, which postulates that prenatal and perinatal chemical exposure can contribute to risk of childhood and adolescent obesity, remains relatively underexamined. This review surveys numerous classes of chemicals for which this hypothesis has been explored. We focus on human data where they exist and also discuss the findings of rodent and cell culture studies. Organochlorine chemicals as well as several classes of chemicals that are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists are identified as possible risk factors for obesity. Recommendations for future epidemiologic and experimental research on the chemical origins of obesity are also given. Mt Sinai J Med 78:22?48, 2011. ? 2011 Mount Sinai School of Medicine

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective: To assess the impact of epicardial patch electrode position on internal defibrillation efficacy. Methods: Two mesh patch electrodes (13 cm2) were positioned on the epicardium of acute, isoflurane- anesthetized pigs (n = 7, 40?47 kg). Defibrillation efficacy was determined for three different patch positions: P1 = anterior-basal right ventricle (RV) and lateral-apical left ventricle (LV); P2 = lateral RV and lateral LV; and P3 = anterior-basal septal region and posterior-apical septal region. To quantify defibrillation efficacy, single capacitor discharge, fixed-tilt (68%) biphasic waveforms were delivered to the heart 10 seconds after initiation of ventricular fibrillation. Initial shock intensities were selected using an up/down protocol. Conversion data were used to construct sigmoidal curves relating probability of defibrillation to energy delivered, peak voltage, and peak current in each animal. Results: Mean peak voltage and current at 50% defibrillation probability were 40% higher for P2 than they were for either P1 or P3 (p < 0.05). Similarly, mean energy delivered was 75% higher for P2. In this pig model, position of epicardial patch electrodes affects defibrillation efficacy. Conclusion: Apical-to-basal shock vectors (P1 and P3) yielded significantly lower defibrillation shock strength requirements than did a lateral-wall-to-lateral-wall vector (P2), which was perpendicular to the intraventricular septum. These data may help explain the disparity in defibrillation thresholds observed in the human population of patients undergoing implantable cardioverter defibrillator testing with epicardial patch electrodes.

AB  - Summary Pain is present in many medical, all traumatic and inflammatory conditions and, without appropriate analgesic management, all post-operative veterinary patients. Pain associated with the abdominal viscera may produce a low to normal heart rate due to vagal activity. Maladaptive pain is generated from a malfunction of neurologic transmission due to the ongoing ?acute? pain and serves no physiological purpose. The humane factor must be considered with administration of analgesics and modalities to prevent and treat pain prior to the patient experiencing the noxious sensation. Pain assessment measures have been utilized by veterinary researchers as a way to quantify pain in various studies and to analyse data. These consist of verbal rating scales (VRS), simple descriptive scales (SDS), numerical rating scales (NRS) and the visual analogue scale (VAS). Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale and its short form (CMPS-SF) is a clinical decision-making tool when used in conjunction with clinical judgement.

AB  - Summary Background Palmar osteochondral disease (POD) is a common cause of lameness in competition horses. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive diagnostic modality currently available, however it may not be financially or logistically practical for routine screening of POD. There is increasing interest in the use of metabolomics for diagnosis prior to progression to irreversible damage. Objectives To determine metabolite levels in synovial fluid (SF) of horses with a clinical diagnosis of POD based on diagnostic analgesia and MRI, with the hypothesis that metabolomic profiles differ between diseased and healthy joints. Study design Prospective clinical study. Methods Synovial fluid was collected from metacarpo/tarsophalangeal joints (MC/TPJ) of 29 horses (n = 51 joints), including 14 controls (n = 26) and 15 cases (n = 25), the latter with lameness localised to the MC/TPJ and MR changes consistent with POD (n = 23). Spectra were produced using 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and analysed. Results Twenty-five metabolites were recognised associated with various biosynthetic and degradation pathways. The metabolite abundances within the controls demonstrated increased variability compared with the clinical group. The low level of variance between the spectra of the two groups was explained by five principal components. Cross-validation of the cohort demonstrated modest separation of predictive power (R2 = 0.67; Q2 = 0.34). Although statistical significance was not achieved, the most influential metabolites were glucose and lactate. Main limitations The modest sample size and variation in signalment, background and presenting condition of the controls may have impacted the discriminative power of the constructed models. The lack of matched controls, differences in time of fluid collection and freezing times may have also reduced accuracy when representing metabolite profiles. Conclusions This study identified and quantified metabolites present in MC/TPJ SF of clinical cases with POD.

AB  - ABSTRACT Vital rates of large herbivores normally respond to increased resource limitation by following a progressive sequence of effects on life-history characteristics from survival of young, age at first reproduction, reproduction of adults, to adult survival. Expected changes in life-history characteristics, however, should operate through changes in nutritional condition, which is the integrator of nutritional intake and demands represented primarily by the deposition and catabolism of body fat. Elucidating seasonal patterns of nutritional condition and its relative influence on individual and population performance should improve our understanding of life-history strategies and population regulation of ungulates, provide insight into the capacity of available habitat to support population growth, and allow assessment of the underlying consequences of mortality on population dynamics. We acquired longitudinal data on individual female mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and linked those data with environmental and population characteristics. Our goal was to provide a nutritional basis for understanding life-history strategies of these large mammals, and to aid in the conservation and management of large herbivores in general. We studied a migratory population of mule deer that overwintered in Round Valley on the east side of the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, and was subject to a highly variable climate and predation from a suite of large carnivores. We intensively monitored nutritional and life-history characteristics of this population during 1997?2009 as it recovered from a population crash, which occurred during 1985?1991. Deer in Round Valley migrated to high-elevation summer ranges on both sides of the crest of the Sierra Nevada (Sierra crest), where a rain shadow resulted in a mesic and more forested range on the west side compared with xeric conditions east of the Sierra crest. Average survival of neonatal mule deer to 140 days of age during 2006?2008 was 0.33 (SE?=?0.091), but was lower for neonates on the west side (0.13, SE?=?0.092) compared with those on the east side (0.44, SE?=?0.11) of the Sierra crest. Birth mass and nutritional condition of mothers had a positive effect on survival of young; however, those effects were evident only for neonates born east of the crest where predation pressure was less intense compared with the west side. Black bear (Ursus americanus) predation was the main cause of mortality for west-side young (mortality rate?=?0.63, SE?=?0.97) compared with canid and felid predation for east-side young (0.29, SE?=?0.076). Mean autumn recruitment of young during 1997?2008 was lower for females on the west side (0.42, SE?=?0.037) than for females on the east side (0.70, SE?=?0.041) of the crest, and was affected positively by March ingesta-free body fat (IFBFat) of individual females. At the level of the population, ratios of young-to-adult females (1991?2009) were highly variable and strongly related to March IFBFat of adult females during the current and preceding year. Reproduction by yearling females was sensitive to per capita availability of forage during summer (as 1-yr-old individuals), thereby influencing whether a sufficient body mass for ovulation was obtained. Litter size remained high (1.69, SE?=?0.027) during the study, but was influenced positively by forage availability, negatively by summer temperature, and was greater for females that resided on the west side of the Sierra crest during summer than those on the east side. In contrast, pregnancy rates remained unchanged across years of study (0.98, SE?=?0.005). Survival of prime-age (2- to 9-yr-old) females was 0.90 (SE?=?0.021) in summer, 0.94 (SE?=?0.012) in winter, and 0.87 (SE?=?0.025) annually. Although relatively stable across years, both winter and summer survival were influenced positively by the preceding April snowpack relative to the density of the population. Mean IFBFat of adult females was 7.2% (SE?=?0.077) in March 1997?2009 and 9.7% (SE?=?0.23) in November 2002?2008. Nutritional condition offered a mechanistic link between factors that influence resource limitation and population performance, because condition of adult females in autumn and late winter was sensitive to the nutritional history of individual animals as related to forage growth, population density, migratory tactic, reproductive costs, and nutritional carryover. Nutritional condition of adult females in March also was the most parsimonious predictor of finite rate of population growth (?) during the forthcoming year. The relative magnitude of effect of nutritional condition on survival and reproduction was mostly in accordance with the predicted changes of vital rates in response to resource limitation for populations of large herbivores. Our results indicate that management and conservation of large herbivore populations could be improved by integrating indices of nutritional condition into current monitoring and research programs. We offer a method to estimate the proximity of a population to nutritional carrying capacity (NCC) that is based on nutritional status of the population relative to population performance (termed animal-indicated NCC). The proximity of the population to animal-indicated NCC represents the short-term capacity of the environment to support population growth. A nutritional approach to monitor and manage populations offers a direct link to the capacity of the habitat, and reduces the need to estimate population abundance or set goals according to population size. We also propose that the consequences of mortality (degree of additive or compensatory mortality) on population dynamics can be assessed by comparing the estimated nutritional capacity for survival and recruitment of young to that measured empirically, because more young are produced than what the habitat can support when nutrition is limiting. Our approach is useful for quantifying effects of predation, and provides a basis for determining the efficacy of predator control to enhance ungulate populations. ? 2014 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Summary The provision of anaesthesia for patients suffering from anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa is not without its risks. The anaesthetist needs to appreciate that these eating disorders can predispose the patient to significant risk of multi-organ dysfunction related to starvation and purging. Any such organ dysfunction can have serious implications on morbidity and mortality. Therefore, careful peri-operative management is essential to avoid anaesthetic complications. Both disorders are common, with incidences in the general population of up to 30% in girls and young women. A review of the literature on the provision of anaesthesia for anorexic patients was carried out to evaluate the potential impact of these disorders on the patient's physiology and the subsequent implications for anaesthesia.

AB  - Abstract In the present report, we examined the effects of group formation strategy and corral design on wounding and reproduction rates in rhesus macaques. Specifically, we examined group formation using a staged strategy, in which small groups of animals were introduced incrementally over a period of weeks, and a rapid formation strategy, in which all animals were introduced in 1 day. We also examined group formation using a divided corral design that facilitated visual and social separation of individuals, and an undivided corral design that did not facilitate visual or social separation. Dependent measures were wounding and reproductive rates over each of the 2 years that followed group formation. Results indicate that incrementally releasing subgroups of animals, and using a corral design that provides for visual and social separation of individuals, are effective strategies for reducing rates of traumatic wounding when forming multimale-multifemale rhesus macaque breeding groups. However, it must be noted that differences in formation strategy and corral design did not lead to higher reproductive rates. We conclude that incrementally releasing animals in hierarchical subgroups, and using a divided vs. undivided housing design, reduced intra-group wounding and associated demands on veterinary and animal management resources following formation of rhesus macaque breeding groups.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the sedative and analgesic effects of intramuscular buprenorphine with either dexmedetomidine or acepromazine, administered as premedication to cats and dogs undergoing elective surgery. Study design Prospective, randomized, blinded clinical study. Animals Forty dogs and 48 cats. Methods Animals were assigned to one of four groups, according to anaesthetic premedication and induction agent: buprenorphine 20 ?g kg?1 with either dexmedetomidine (dex) 250 ?g m?2 or acepromazine (acp) 0.03 mg kg?1, followed by alfaxalone (ALF) or propofol (PRO). Meloxicam was administered preoperatively to all animals and anaesthesia was always maintained using isoflurane. Physiological measures and assessments of pain, sedation and mechanical nociceptive threshold (MNT) were made before and after premedication, intraoperatively, and for up to 24 hours after premedication. Data were analyzed with one-way, two-way and mixed between-within subjects anova, Kruskall?Wallis analyses and Chi squared tests. Results were deemed significant if p ≤ 0.05, except where multiple comparisons were performed (p ≤ 0.005). Results Cats premedicated with dex were more sedated than cats premedicated with acp (p < 0.001) and ALF doses were lower in dex cats (1.2 ± 1.0 mg kg?1) than acp cats (2.5 ± 1.9 mg kg?1) (p = 0.041). There were no differences in sedation in dogs however PRO doses were lower in dex dogs (1.5 ± 0.8 mg kg?1) compared to acp dogs (3.3 ± 1.1 mg kg?1) (p < 0.001). There were no differences between groups with respect to pain scores or MNT for cats or dogs. Conclusion Choice of dex or acp, when given with buprenorphine, caused minor, clinically detectable, differences in various characteristics of anaesthesia, but not in the level of analgesia. Clinical relevance A combination of buprenorphine with either acp or dex, followed by either PRO or ALF, and then isoflurane, accompanied by an NSAID, was suitable for anaesthesia in dogs and cats undergoing elective surgery. Choice of sedative agent may influence dose of anaesthetic induction agent.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare injectate distribution and potential complications of retrobulbar and peribulbar injections in cat cadavers. Study design Prospective randomized masked study. Animals Ten cat cadavers (20 eyes). Methods A dorsomedial retrobulbar injection (RB) of 1 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine and iopamidol (1:1) was performed in seven eyes. A dorsomedial peribulbar injection (PB-1) of 4 mL of the same injectate was performed in seven eyes, and two peribulbar injections (PB-2) of the same injectate, divided equally between the dorsomedial and ventrolateral regions (2 mL each) were performed in six eyes. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured before, immediately and 15 minutes after injection. Cadavers underwent computed tomography before and following injections. A radiologist scored injectate distribution within the intraconal space (none, moderate, or large) and around the optic nerve (degrees). An injection was defined as likely to provide adequate regional anesthesia if the volume of distribution of intraconal injectate was ?large? and it contacted over 270° of the optic nerve circumference. Results The success rate (95% confidence interval) of RB, PB-1, and PB-2 injections was 71% (29.0?96.3%), 86% (42.1?99.6%), and 67% (22.3?95.7%), respectively. With all three techniques, IOP increased significantly after injection, but returned to baseline by 15 minutes following RB injection. No intraocular, intravascular, intrathecal, or intraneural injectate was observed. Conclusion and clinical relevance The single-peribulbar injection technique may be superior to retrobulbar or double-peribulbar injections, however, all techniques require further studies in live cats to determine safety and efficacy prior to clinical use.

AB  - Lorazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine that interacts with a high degree of affinity for the GABA receptor complex. This high affinity binding in turn leads to a prolonged duration of action. There are no published clinical studies documenting its duration of action in dogs or its ability to control seizures. The purpose of this study was to compare the duration of seizure control of lorazepam with diazepam in 16 dogs presenting in status epilepticus or with active cluster seizures. Previous seizure history and anticonvulsant therapy was not a consideration for inclusion into this study. Animals were excluded if there was a known metabolic, toxic or traumatic cause of the seizure. Dogs were randomly assigned to receive either lorazepam (0.2?mg/kg IV) or diazepam (0.5?mg/kg IV), and the clinicians were blinded as to which drug they were administering. The duration of the study was 12 hours from the time of drug administration, and the animals were monitored for any indication of seizure activity, including generalized motor activity, focal motor activity (e.g., movement of facial or limb musculature) and change in the level of consciousness. The study ended at 12 hours post-study drug administration or when the dog seized before the end of the 12 hour study period. The results indicated no significant difference between lorazepam versus diazepam with regard to median seizure-free interval (2.8?h for diazepam versus 3.4?h for lorazepam, p=0.58 by log rank test), or with regard to percent seizure-free for the duration of the observation period (1/8 for lorazepam versus 3/8 for diazepam, p=0.51 by Fisher's exact test). There was also no difference between the 2 drugs regarding the number of animals in which seizures were initially controlled (6/8 in each group). Lorazepam used at this dose does not appear to result in a significant increase in duration of seizure control for dogs with status epilepticus and cluster seizures. Additional studies may be warranted using higher doses of lorazepam.

AB  - This report describes a case of neutrophilic dermatosis in a dog, with a number of clinical and pathological similarities to human pyoderma gangrenosum. A seven-year-old, female German shepherd dog with a history of non-erosive idiopathic polyarthritis was presented with severe facial swelling, bilateral erosivoulcerative lesions on the muzzle and multiple, eroded, dermal-subcutaneous nodules on the cranial trunk. Histopathological examination of skin biopsies revealed a necrotising neutrophilic dermatitis. No infectious agents could be detected using specific stains, immunohistochemistry, serology and bacterial aerobic, anaerobic or fungal cultures. A sterile neutrophilic dermatosis resembling human pyoderma gangrenosum was presumptively diagnosed, and the patient showed an excellent response to treatment with prednisone and ciclosporin.
