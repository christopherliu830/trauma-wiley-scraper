AB  - Summary Prolonged surgical anaesthesia in the dog was induced with propofol (6.5 ± 1.3 mg/kg) followed by alfentanil (25.5 ± 5 ?g/kg) (mean ± 1 sd) and maintained with a continuous infusion of propofol (0.14 to 0.18 mg/kg/min) and alfentanil (2 to 3 ?g/kg/min). Neuromuscular blockade was produced with vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg). After induction of anaesthesia with propofol, administration of alfentanil to dogs which had received no pre-anaesthetic medication produced cardiac arrest and apnoea. Administration of atropine intravenously immediately prior to alfentanil prevented these cardiac depressant effects. The cardiac depressant effect of alfentanil was not as severe in a second group of dogs in which anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone. After commencing the continuous infusion anaesthetic regime and establishment of IPPV, blood pressure and heart rate remained stable during the remaining 4 to 6 h period of anaesthesia. Recovery from anaesthesia was smooth and uneventful. The depressant effects of alfentanil on respiration and on consciousness were reversed rapidly by administration of nalbuphine (10 mg total dose). The smooth recovery and the integration of anaesthesia and post operative analgesia attained by the reversal of alfentanil with nalbuphine make this an attractive anaesthetic regime for major surgery in dogs, provided that facilities for IPPV are available.

AB  - Objectives: Previous studies of cats in the USA and New Zealand have identified a number of risk factors for the development of hyperthyroidism including feeding of canned cat food and being non-purebred. The objective of this study was to examine these and other risk factors in cats from London, UK. Methods: A questionnaire-based case-control study of hyperthyroidism in cats greater than eight years of age was undertaken. Cases and controls were recruited from two groups of first opinion clinics in London, UK (five locations in total). The two-page questionnaire investigated details of lifestyle, diet and exposure to environmental chemicals. Data analysis included multivariable analysis of risk factors using binary logistic regression. Results: One hundred and nine hyperthyroid cats and 196 control cats were surveyed. Increasing age, non-pure breed, use of a litter box, more than 50 per cent wet food in the diet, a diet that included fish and exposure to food in a can were identified as risk factors for the development of hyperthyroidism using multivariable analysis. Clinical Significance: Risk factors for hyperthyroidism in cats from the UK appear similar to those of other countries. Exposure to food packaged in a can was identified as the major risk factor for the development of hyperthyroidism.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To investigate the cardiovascular effects of epidural romifidine in isoflurane-anaesthetized dogs. Study design? Prospective, randomized, blinded experiment. Animals? A total of six healthy adult female Beagles aged 1.25?±?0.08?years and weighing 12.46?± 1.48 (10.25?14.50) kg. Methods? Anaesthesia was induced with propofol (6?9?mg?kg?1) and maintained with 1.8?1.9% end-tidal isoflurane in oxygen. End-tidal CO2 was kept between 35 and 45?mmHg (4.7?6.0?kPa) using intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Heart rate (HR), arterial blood pressure and cardiac output (CO) were monitored. Cardiac output was determined using a LiDCO monitor and the derived parameters were calculated. After baseline measurements, either 10??g?kg?1 romifidine or saline (total volume 1?mL 4.5?kg?1) was injected into the lumbosacral epidural space. Data were recorded for 1?hour after epidural injection. A minimum of 1?week elapsed between treatments. Results? After epidural injection, the overall means (±?standard deviation, SD) of HR (95?±?20?bpm), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) (81 ± 19?mmHg), CO (1.63?±?0.66?L?minute?1), cardiac index (CI) (2.97?±?1.1?L?minute?1?m?2) and stroke volume index (SI) (1.38?±?0.21?mL beat?1?kg?1) were significantly lower in the romifidine treatment compared with the overall means in the saline treatment [HR (129?±?24?bpm), MAP (89 ± 17?mmHg), CO (3.35?±?0.86?L?minute?1), CI (6.17 ± 1.4?L?minute?1?m?2) and SI (2.21?±?0.21?mL?beat?1?kg?1)]. The overall mean of systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) (7202?± 2656 dynes seconds cm?5?m?2) after epidural romifidine injection was significantly higher than the overall mean of SVRI (3315?±?1167 dynes seconds cm?5?m?2) after epidural saline injection. Conclusion? Epidural romifidine in isoflurane-anaesthetized dogs caused significant cardiovascular effects similar to those reportedly produced by systemic romifidine administration. Clinical relevance? Similar cardiovascular monitoring is required after epidural and systemically administered romifidine. Further studies are required to evaluate the analgesic effects of epidural romifidine.

AB  - Summary Flaxseed proteins are potent multi-functional ingredients for food formulation owing to their techno-functionalities, food preservation capacity, and health benefits. A possible synergistic effect with mucilage on their functionalities could be valuable even though this co-product in flaxseed may limit the protein yield during their production processes. Their techno-functional properties could also be considered in mixture with other flax bioactive components such as lignans and fibre to enhance the value of the flaxseed meal. The present paper reviews flaxseed protein uses in food and their health benefits. New perspectives according to consumers? demand for products with health promoting bioactive components are also suggested.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the isoflurane sparing effect of intratesticular lidocaine administration in dogs undergoing castration. Methods Thirty dogs received a standardised anaesthetic regimen including systemic analgesia with intramuscular buprenorphine at a dose of 0·02 mg/kg and intravenous carprofen at a dose of 4 mg/kg. Dogs were randomly assigned to a lidocaine group receiving 1 mg/kg lidocaine into each testis or a control group receiving no lidocaine. Baseline physiological parameters were measured after 10 minutes at an end-tidal isoflurane concentration of 1·3%. End-tidal isoflurane concentration was altered throughout surgery to maintain these parameters within 10% of baseline and recorded at five time points. T0 was baseline, T1 was the start of surgery, T2 to T3 were clamping of the testicular pedicles and T4 was skin closure. End-tidal isoflurane concentrations were compared using analysis of variance and Bonferroni tests. Results Fifteen healthy dogs were included in each study group. End-tidal isoflurane concentration was significantly lower in the lidocaine group compared to the control group at T2 (P<0·01), T3 (P<0·01) and T4 (P<0·01). Clinical Significance Intratesticular lidocaine reduces isoflurane requirements in dogs undergoing castration.

AB  - Summary An adult Quarter Horse gelding (Case 1) was evaluated for tachypnoea and acute dysphagia. A 20-year-old Quarter Horse gelding (Case 2) was evaluated for respiratory stertor and severe, acute swelling of the head in the submandibular region. A physical examination, complete blood count, blood chemistry, upper airway endoscopy, and peripheral blood Anaplasma phagocytophilum polymerase chain reaction were completed for both horses. Both horses tested positive for A. phagocytophilum. The upper airway endoscopy for Case 1 revealed a feed contaminated pharynx, absent swallowing reflex, and left laryngeal hemiplagia. The upper airway endoscopy for Case 2 revealed severe diffuse pharyngeal swelling occluding the airway. Due to increased respiratory effort in Case 2, a tracheotomy was performed. In both horses, treatment consisted of intravenous oxytetracycline 6.6 mg/kg bwt i.v. q. 24 h for 2?3 days followed by minocycline 4 mg/kg bwt per os q. 12 h for 10?14 days. Both horses made full recoveries.

AB  - Abstract Hyroxyapatite (HA) and its nanocomposites reinforced with 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2?wt% graphite nanosheets (GNs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) are fabricated by means of spark plasma sintering (SPS) process. The effects of MWNT and GN additions on the morphology, mechanical behavior, cell adhesion, and biocompatibility of HA were studied. Three-point-bending test shows that the bending strength of MWNT/HA nanocomposites increases with increasing MWNT content. However, the bending strength of GN/HA nanocomposites initially increases by adding 0.5?wt% GN, and then decreases markedly as the filler content increases. Cell culture and viability test results demonstrate that the GNs with diameters of several micrometers retard osteoblast cell adhesion and proliferation on the GN/HA nanocomposite. In contrast, the addition of 2?wt% MWNT to HA is beneficial to promote osteoblast adhesion and proliferation, thereby enhancing the biocompatibility of MWNT/HA nanocomposite.

AB  - ABSTRACT The nature of the dog's behaviour is reviewed. The nervous system is activated by afferent nerve impulses generated in various sense-organs. The sum of internal (motivation) and external stimuli is analysed in a steady state system. A marked discrepancy between important set values and their actual values will make the organism react. A communication system consisting of the dog handler, the dog, signals and key-stimuli and other external influences (noise), is used when training a dog. The change of behaviour is more permanent and a new behaviour pattern is established more rapidly when the training is organized in such a way that key-stimuli and conditioned signals which elicit wanted behaviour sequences are reiterated many times before a verbal command is added to the stimuli. A dog handler must also know the activation of emotional behaviour. Stress, coping and aggression are expressions used to describe such activation. A general check-list to be used when starting training tasks are suggested. The exercise ?retrieve? is used as an example.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the sonomorphologic changes of the female pelvic floor after childbirth. Furthermore the timing of the appearance of these defects labor are examined. Methods We examined three groups of patients. 104 primiparae after vaginal delivery, 26 primiparae after elective cesarean section and 77 primiparae after secondary cesarean section within 3?7?days after delivery. To assess the morphology of the pelvic floor we used to examine the anal morphology, whereas the transrectal route was used to assess the paraurethral fixation of the lateral vaginal edges. Paravaginal defect was defined as descent of the lateral vaginal edges below the suburethral portion of the vagina and defects of the internal anal sphincter is defined by anterior vs. posterior thickness-ratio below 0.5. Clinical symptoms were documented using a standardized questionnaire. Results Primiparae after elective cesarean section served as control group. After vaginal delivery 7.3% of women showed urinary and 17.7% anal incontinence. Mode of delivery is significantly associated with anal and urinary incontinence. Paraurethral defect is predictive for urinary incontinence. Morphological defects of the pelvic floor could be documented after dilatation of the cervix to more than 7?cm. Conclusions Volume sonography after childbirth allows to document trauma to the pelvic floor due to vaginal delivery. Defects of the anterior compartment are predictive for the development of urinary incontinence. To study the timing of the appearance of pelvic floor defects during the course of vaginal delivery may be helpful for obstetrical decision making.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol with or without 2% benzyl alcohol administered intravenously (IV) as a single induction dose in cats. Study design Prospective experimental study. Animals Six healthy adult cats, three female intact, three male castrated, weighing 4.8 ± 1.8 kg. Methods Cats received 8 mg kg?1 IV of propofol (P) or propofol with 2% benzyl alcohol (P28) using a randomized crossover design. Venous blood samples were collected at predetermined time points to 24 hours after drug administration to determine drug plasma concentrations. Physiologic and behavioral variables were also recorded. Propofol and benzyl alcohol concentrations were determined using high pressure liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Pharmacokinetic parameters were described using a 2-compartment model. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were analyzed using repeated measures anova (p < 0.05). Results Plasma concentrations of benzyl alcohol were below the lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) at all time points for two of the six cats (33%), and by 30 minutes for the remaining four cats. Propofol pharmacokinetics, with or without 2% benzyl alcohol, were characterized by rapid distribution, a long elimination phase, and a large volume of distribution. No differences were noted between treatments with the exception of clearance from the second compartment (CLD2), which was 23.6 and 38.8 mL kg?1 minute?1 in the P and P28 treatments, respectively. Physiologic and behavioral variables were not different between treatments with the exception of heart rate at 4 hours post administration. Conclusions and clinical relevance The addition of 2% benzyl alcohol as a preservative minimally altered the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol 1% emulsion when administered as a single IV bolus in this group of cats. These data support the cautious use of propofol with 2% benzyl alcohol for induction of anesthesia in healthy cats.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: In order to evaluate its potential as an adjunct to inhalant anaesthesia in horses, the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl must first be determined. Objectives: To describe the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl and its metabolite, N-[1-(2-phenethyl-4-piperidinyl)maloanilinic acid (PMA), after i.v. administration of a single dose to horses that were awake in Treatment 1 and anaesthetised with isoflurane in Treatment 2. Methods: A balanced crossover design was used (n = 4/group). During Treatment 1, horses received a single dose of fentanyl (4 ?g/kg bwt, i.v.) and during Treatment 2, they were anaesthetised with isoflurane and maintained at 1.2 ? minimum alveolar anaesthetic concentration. After a 30 min equilibration period, a single dose of fentanyl (4 ?g/kg bwt, i.v.) was administered to each horse. Plasma fentanyl and PMA concentrations were measured at various time points using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results: Anaesthesia with isoflurane significantly decreased mean fentanyl clearance (P < 0.05). The fentanyl elimination half-life, in awake and anaesthetised horses, was 1 h and volume of distribution at steady state was 0.37 and 0.26 l/kg bwt, respectively. Anaesthesia with isoflurane also significantly decreased PMA apparent clearance and volume of distribution. The elimination half-life of PMA was 2 and 1.5 h in awake and anaesthetised horses, respectively. Conclusions and potential relevance: Pharmacokinetics of fentanyl and PMA in horses were substantially altered in horses anaesthetised with isoflurane. These pharmacokinetic parameters provide information necessary for determination of suitable fentanyl loading and infusion doses in awake and isoflurane-anaesthetised horses.

After sedation (romifidine) and induction (midazolam?+?ketamine), anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. After 90?minutes (=?T0), one of four treatments was administered: saline 0.1?mL?kg?1 (S), enoximone 0.5?mg?kg?1 IV (E), enoximone followed by dobutamine (0.5 ?g kg?1?minute?1 for 120?minutes) (ED) or enoximone followed by a calcium chloride infusion (0.5 mg kg?1?minute?1 for 10?minutes) (EC). Data were recorded for 120?minutes after T0. The PulseCO (recorded from carotid artery) was calibrated before T0, no further recalibrations were performed. was determined with LiDCO (LiDCO) and PulseCO (PulseCO) simultaneously at T5, T10, T20, T40, T60, T80, T100 and T120. Systemic vascular resistances (SVRLiDCO and SVRPulseCO) were calculated. Results  In the saline group, PulseCO was 4.9?± 12.3% lower than LiDCO (p?<?0.01), whereas SVRPulseCO was 6.9?±?14.4% higher than SVRLiDCO (p?<?0.01). These differences increased over time (mean?±?SEM), by 0.06?±?0.03% minute?1 (p?=?0.042) and SVR by 0.08?±?0.03% minute?1 (p?=?0.018). PulseCO was higher than LiDCO in the EC group (1.8?±?23.3%), but lower than LiDCO in groups E (?11.7?±?20.4%) and ED (?10.0?± 25.9%) (significant difference between treatments, p?<?0.01). The differences in SVR in groups E (20.4?±?32.0%) and ED (20.7?± 35.3%) were significantly higher than in groups S (6.9?±?14.4%) and EC (3.1?±?22.2%) (p?< 0.01). Conclusions and clinical relevance? Pulse contour analysis values deviated significantly from LiDCO measurements in isoflurane-anaesthetized ponies. This difference was influenced by inotropic/vasoactive drugs.

AB  - Introduction Exercise training can enhance antioxidant status, but it is unknown whether selenium supplementation can further improve antioxidant defenses. Methods American Quarter Horse yearlings (n?=?20; mean?±?SE 18?±?0.2 months) balanced with regard to age and sex were randomly assigned to four dietary Se and training treatments for 14 weeks: 0.1?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training or 0.3?mg?Se/kg DM with (n?=?5) or without (n?=?5) training. Trained horses were exercised 4?d/wk for 30?min/d. At wk 14, all horses underwent a 2-hr, 27.5?km submaximal exercise test (SET). Blood samples and biopsies of the gluteus medius were obtained before and after training and in response to the SET. Serum Se, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in whole blood and muscle, and plasma lipid hydroperoxides (LPO) were evaluated. Data were analysed using a mixed model ANOVA with repeated measures. Results Serum Se was higher (P?=?0.02) at wk 14 in trained horses receiving 0.3 than 0.1?mg?Se/kg, but was unaffected by diet in untrained horses. Muscle GPx activity was unchanged after 14-weeks of Se and training, but in response to the SET, muscle GPx was higher (P?=?0.05) in trained than untrained horses. An effect of training*time (P?=?0.008) was noted for whole blood GPx, reflecting greater (P?=?0.01) activity in trained than untrained horses immediately after the SET. Plasma LPO was not influenced by dietary Se, but increased (P<0.0001) in untrained horses immediately after the SET while remaining unchanged in trained horses. Conclusions Training appears to mitigate oxidative damage in response to prolonged exercise in young horses. Although trained horses responded to a higher level of dietary Se, it showed no clear advantage for reducing oxidative stress.

AB  - Introduction Equine training often includes running on tracks with different uphill (UP) or downhill (DOWN) slopes and examination of lame horses on a slope can be used to investigate the origin of lameness. However little is known about the kinetics of horses in such circumstances. The aim of this study was to quantify and compare ground reaction force, acceleration and sliding of the hoof in the forelimb of horses trotting an uphill and downhill slope. Methods The right front hoof of 5 horses was equipped with a dynamometric horseshoe and an accelerometer allowing the measurement of 3D ground reaction force and hoof acceleration and displacement. The horses were trotted in hand (3.5?m/s) on a 7% inclined asphalt area successively uphill and downhill. Data were analysed using an ANOVA, accounting for correlated repeated measurements within each horse (P<0.01). Results Speed was not significantly different between UP and DOWN. The maximal longitudinal breaking force of the hoof, maximal vertical force, vertical impulse and longitudinal sliding of the hoof at impact were significantly increased on DOWN compared to UP (respectively +97.7%, +8.4%, +16.6% and +450%). Stride frequency and longitudinal propulsive force were significantly decreased on DOWN compared to UP (respectively ?5.1% and ?48.7%). Conclusions The results of this study (increased longitudinal breaking force and maximal vertical force on a downward slope) are consistent with previous measurements of superficial digital flexor tendon loading on the same area [1]. Conversely increased propulsive force on an uphill slope needs to be taken into account during rehabilitation of horses with deep digital flexor tendon injuries.

AB  - Introduction Poor hoof angle and hoof pastern alignment has been linked to lameness in mature horses. External characteristics, such as the hoof pastern axis and hoof angle, are commonly used to assess dorsopalmar conformation in the same manner in foals. The hoof wall integument and distal phalanx is parallel in healthy mature horses but not in foals: this is not understood. Methods The front feet of 22 Thoroughbred foals were radiographed and measured in June and again in November. Lateromedial radiographic images were measured (Osirix) for hoof integument angle and width, and proximal, middle and distal phalanx angles. The data were tabulated in Excel and analysed in Minitab. After assessment for normality (Anderson-Darling), potential relationships were assessed for differences between June and November using paired t-tests and regression analysis. Results The dorsal hoof angle became more acute with age, R2?=?0.3326, the mean of June, 59.05?±?3.662°, was significantly different from November, 53.64?±?2.7824°, P<0.0001. The hoof pastern axes were broken forward in June, 6.1?±?2.1°, in November 2.5?±?1.6°, whereas the phalangeal axes were broken back, June,-11.0?±?7.5°, November, ?8.3?±?4.4°. There was a significant relationship between age and hoof pastern axis alignment, R2?=?0.3746; P<0.0001. The phalangeal axis did not correlate with age. The relationship between age and parallelism of the integument was significant R2?=?0.4867; P<0.0001. Conclusions The cause of the non-alignment of the hoof pastern axis and phalangeal axis in Thoroughbred foals is widening of hoof integument proximodistally and circumferential bone thickening of the distal phalanx. Assumptions of phalangeal angles based on external characteristics cannot be made in foals.
