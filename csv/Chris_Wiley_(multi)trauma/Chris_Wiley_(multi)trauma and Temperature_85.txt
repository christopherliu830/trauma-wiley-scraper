AB  - Introduction Mangalarga Marchador (MM) is the most important Brazilian horse breed. Functional evaluation of MM horses is performed in marcha competitions, where horses must perform 4-gaited exercise at 13?km/h for 70?min. The aim of this work was to test a training protocol to prepare MM horses for marcha competition. Methods Eight untrained MM mares, in randomized blocks with Split plots, were trained for 84 days. Three days/week horses were ridden for one hour (10?min walk, then an individual amount of marcha exercise at 13?km/h established in a previous test, then walk to complete one hour total exercise time). Two days/week, horses walked for one hour. Before training and every 21 days a marcha test (MT) was performed, totaling 5 tests in the experimental period. During the MT, mares were exercised at 13?km/h using a heart rate monitor. Every 10?min heart rate (HR) and blood lactate concentration [La] were recorded. The MT was stopped at 70?min of exercise, or if HR was ≥150?bpm and [La] was ≥4?mmol/L, or if Marcha Time was reached. Blood samples for hemogram, lactate, glucose, triglyceride and CK, LDH, AST determination were collected. Individual time used for training was 10?min less than the exercising time in the previous MT. Regression was used to analyze the results. Results From MT 1 to 4, the positive effect of training was shown on HR, [La] and marcha time (from 9.52?min to 70.5?min, CV?=?26.41). There was not an increase in marcha time on test 5. Conclusions MM mares trained for 63?days with the described protocol are ready to compete in marcha competition.

AB  - Introduction Poll flexion may play an important role in the development of dynamic upper respiratory tract (URT) collapse. However, limited investigations have been performed in Standardbred racehorses. Methods Eight Standardbreds were examined during training, once flexed and once in extension, using a randomised crossover design. Head position was maintained using modified check-reins and head-neck angle was recorded. On each occasion horses performed 2 rounds of exercise of 2400?m at ?35?km/h. Speed and heart rate (HR) were measured and blood obtained before and after exercise. URT endoscopy was performed during the second round. Videos were blinded and URT function assessed. HR, plasma lactate (Lac) and speed were compared for different head positions using paired t-tests. Cortisol was analysed using repeated-measures ANOVA and URT function using Fisher's exact tests and paired t-tests (P<0.05). Results Data were excluded for one horse where head-neck angle could not be measured. Flexed and extended head-neck angles differed significantly (mean: 85.0° vs 97.8°; P?=?0.001). All horses showed some form of URT collapse during exercise, although this was only deemed clinically significant in 4 horses with a history of abnormal noise. These horses showed additional abnormalities during flexion. However, mean severity scores did not reach statistical significance (P?=?0.08). No significant difference was found for speed, HR or Lac. A significant increase in cortisol was found with exercise (P<0.001). The interaction between time and head position approached significance (P?=?0.09) with higher concentrations of cortisol generally occurring in extension rather than flexion. Conclusions URT abnormalities may be exacerbated with poll flexion. The use of equipment to modify head position may induce a stress response.

AB  - Introduction Healthy and poorly performing horses can display arrhythmias during exercise and immediately afterwards. The relationship of arrhythmias to exercise intensity or type, and their frequency of recurrence, are poorly understood. Clarification of these issues was the objective of this investigation. Methods Electrocardiograms were recorded on 9 Thoroughbreds during maximal and submaximal exercise on a racetrack (RA) and treadmill (TM). The frequency of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias for RA and TM were compared using Fisher's Exact Test. Results 65 workouts (TM?=?46, RA?=?19; median[range]: 4/horse[2?14]) were performed. Exercising arrhythmias were detected in 4/9 horses (12/65 workouts) and there were post-exercise arrhythmias in 7/9 horses (20/65 workouts). A single exercising electrocardiogram per horse often did not display all arrhythmias detected over several workouts. 3/9 horses exhibited arrhythmias during the first and second runs while the other 6 had none. 4/9 had 1 post-exercise arrhythmia. Of 6 horses with >3 runs, 1 displayed arrhythmias each time, 3 never had arrhythmias and 2 sometimes showed arrhythmias during exercise (1/9 and 4/8 workouts, respectively). All 6 intermittently had post-exercise arrhythmias (median[range]: 50% [9?75%] of workouts). Presence of arrhythmias was positively related to intensity and all occurred at ≥94%HRmax. The frequency of arrhythmias following RA (29%) and TM (12.5%) was not statistically different. Conclusions Gallops on TM or RA were equally effective for detecting arrhythmias. The presence/absence of exercising arrhythmias was more repeatable than post-exercise arrhythmias. Arrhythmias are more likely to be detected at maximal or near-maximal intensities. A larger population needs to be studied before firm conclusions are drawn. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol.

AB  - Introduction Previous research suggests stalling may have a negative influence on bone mineral content (BMC). Yet slow, long-distance exercise has not been successful in improving BMC compared to free-choice exercise. Still, it is a common practice to stall horses with light exercise and minimal turnout. We hypothesized stalled horses, despite ?weekend? turnout and light exercise, would have lower estimated BMC compared to pasture turnout. Methods Thirteen mature horses were split into two groups, Control (C, n?=?6) and Stalled (S, n?=?7). Digital radiographs were taken of the third metacarpal for estimation of BMC by radiographic bone aluminum equivalence (RBAE). After a 42-d period (P1) additional radiographs were taken and S-horses stalled for 4-d (receiving light under-saddle exercise), followed by 72-h pasture turnout. This pattern repeated for an additional 42-d (P2) followed by radiographs. Radiographs were analyzed for optical density of bone cortices and total BMC compared to an aluminum step-wedge on each cassette. Changes in BMC were analyzed using PROC mixed in SAS with repeated measures. Results No treatment differences were observed in the medial (P?=?0.72) or lateral (P?=?0.46) cortices. Dorsal and palmar cortices exhibited a treatment by period interaction (P<0.01, P<0.02), remaining unchanged in C but S decreased over P1 and returned to baseline in P2. Total RBAE was not different by treatment or period. Conclusions Contrary to our hypothesis, horses stalled with light exercise and ?weekend? turnout maintained BMC compared to themselves and controls at pasture. Such management may be considered for maintaining BMC when horses must be stalled for weekday riding or training. Further research is necessary to determine minimum turnout and exercise needs to maintain BMC when stalling.

AB  - Introduction One of the causes of injury to the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) is assumed to be repeated high intensity loading of the tendon. Earlier fatigue of the deep digital flexor muscle (DDFM) in comparison to the time of fatigue of the superficial digital flexor muscle (SDFM) is also assumed to increase load on the SDFT during long distance running. This study evaluated the fatigue of SDFM and DDFM with maximal exercise. Methods Two wire electrodes were inserted into the SDFM and DDFM of 6 Thoroughbred horses (461?557?kg). Electromyogram (EMG) and hoof strain gauge signals were recorded at 2,500?Hz with horses on an inclined treadmill (6%), and filter processing was applied (high-pass 10?Hz for EMG and low-pass 200?Hz for strain gauge). Integrated EMG (iEMG), the median frequency (MF) of EMG, and the stride frequency (SF) were compared using paired t-test during 100?105% heart rate max exercise and trotting before and after maximal exercise. Results The SF significantly decreased and iEMG of SDFM tended to decrease during maximal exercise (P?=?0.055), while MF of EMG in SDFM and DDFM did not change. The iEMG of SDFM and DDFM significantly decreased and MF of EMG in DDFM tended to decrease at a trot after maximal exercise (P?=?0.063). Conclusions The DDFM may fatigue earlier than SDFM during long distance running. Further study is needed to evaluate the relationship between the decrease in iEMG of SDFM and DDFM during maximal exercise and the injury to SDFT.

AB  - Introduction Selecting the appropriate nutritional supplements for performance horses is difficult, due to significant gaps in the current scientific evidence. Our hypothesis was that nutritional supplements are chosen based on owner's perception of discipline specific health and performance problems. Methods A mixed methods (open and closed questions) online questionnaire was distributed through British Eventing and Dressage websites, to collect data on demographics of owners and their horses, supplements used, and their opinion on health and performance problems in their discipline, and in their own horses. Data was evaluated using descriptive analysis and Sign and Fisher's exact tests for quantitative data, and thematic analysis for qualitative data. Results 599 responses met the inclusion criteria, of which 441 were or had competed in dressage, and 158 in eventing (unaffiliated novice to affiliated advanced levels). Participants had been riding for 26.4 (3?60) (mean (range)) years, currently competed 1.2 (0?10) horses, and used 2 (0?12) supplements in their top horse. Participants ranked the most important health and performance issues as (1) Energy and behaviour, (2) Lameness, (3) Back and muscle problems for dressage, and (1) Lameness, (2) Energy and behaviour, (3) Stamina and fitness for eventing horses. The most common reason supplements were used in individual horses were (1) Joints and mobility, (2) Behavioural problems for dressage, and (1) Electrolytes, (2) Joints and mobility for eventing. Conclusions There was discrepancy between participants' opinions of the main health and performance problems within their discipline, and their reasons for using supplements.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Diarrhoea is the most common disease in young calves, accounting for about 50% of all calf deaths. The disease can be easily recognised and it is important that treatment is administered rapidly in order to maximise the chance of survival. However, equally important is a thorough understanding of the underlying causes of the disease and the implementation of appropriate management steps to minimise the impact of the disease in the future. This article discusses the most common causes of neonatal diarrhoea and seeks the advice of the panel on how best to treat and manage them.

AB  - Aims and objectives To evaluate current research evidence reporting outcomes from modified early warning scoring system tools utilisation to prevent failure to rescue in hospitalised adult medical-surgical/telemetry patients. Background Early sepsis detection exhibits clinical significance to practitioners and patients. Thorough and timely clinical observations, along with a willingness of nurses to call for help, are pivotal to survival of hospitalised patients. This project examined effects of modified early warning scoring system tool usage on patient mortality and failure to rescue events in hospitalised adult medical-surgical/telemetry patients as reported in the literature. Design A comprehensive review and evaluation of published peer-reviewed literature was conducted. Methods Electronic databases searched included PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library of systematic reviews and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality through 2014. Results Eighteen articles were identified for review. Evidence ratings included 6% (1) Level I, 44% (8) Level IV, 6% (1) Level V, 33% (6) Level VI and 11% (2) Level VII. Six reported mortality predictive value and/or reduction, three measured impact on emergency calls, and four reported impact on mortality and rapid response team utilisation. Conclusion While modified early warning scoring system tools have been widely adopted and are recommended for utility in detection of inpatients at-risk for clinical deterioration, limited high-level data and no clinical trials linking use of modified early warning scoring system tool usage to robust outcomes were found. Established criteria for validating modified early warning scoring system criteria, organisational-specific reliability testing and multi-site trials are recommended. Relevance to clinical practice Development of all-cause illness screening tools, including sepsis, is imperative. The clinical picture may be quantified with scoring tools to assist nurses? clinical decision-making, thus leading to improved outcomes and decreased incidence of failure to rescue. Clinical outcomes of interest should be measured and reported in peer-reviewed literature to disseminate the impact on clinical outcomes.

AB  - Introduction The use of complementary therapies in both humans and animals has grown over the past decade. Equine back problems are more frequently reported as a contributing factor to poor performance, and back dysfunction affects limb kinematics. This study aimed to determine if (McTimoney) chiropractic treatment has an effect on the range of motion (ROM) of the carpus and tarsus. Methods Hemispherical 35?mm markers were applied to 7 anatomical landmarks of both forelimbs and hindlimbs of 10 sound, healthy horses from the same riding school with similar workload. The treatment group (n?=?5) received (McTimoney) chiropractic treatment for the neck, back, pelvis and front feet. Two digital video recorders set 5.5?m from subjects, filming both sides concurrently, collected 2-D kinematic data at walk and trot, 1 day before, and 2?hrs and 7 days after treatment. Data was analysed using Kinovea software, minimum and maximum joint angles were measured and ROM calculated. Statistical analyses included two-way ANOVA, Student's t-test and symmetry indices. Results A significant increase in right-side ROM for carpus at walk (+4.0?deg, p?=?0.04) and trot (+5.2?deg, p?=?0.02) was noted in the treated compared to the non-treated group. For the treatment group, there was a significant change in carpus ROM asymmetry from left towards neutral at walk (P?=?0.004) and trot (P?=?0.04). Tarsus ROM asymmetry change from left towards neutral was significant (P?=?0.02) at trot. No changes were observed in the control group. Conclusions These results support the hypothesis that (McTimoney) chiropractic treatment may improve the symmetry of tarsus and carpus ROM of horses. Further research is needed to assess the clinical relevance of these effects. Ethical Animal Research Procedures were reviewed by the McTimoney Chiropractic College Ethical Review Committee.

AB  - Introduction Racetrack surface type has been shown to affect horse injury rates, limb kinematics, and ground reaction forces. Understanding hoof-surface interactions may direct surface design to reduce the incidence of musculoskeletal injury. Hoof accelerations have been recorded at the trot on different surfaces. This study extends these analyses to racing gallop with quantified surface properties. Methods Left fore-hoof accelerations (triaxial, ±?500?g, 1000?Hz) were collected during gallop (10?16?m/s, 5 Thoroughbred racehorses) on dirt and synthetic surfaces of known shear strengths (shear vane). Accelerometric vectors were filtered (5th order Butterworth, stance 85?Hz, swing 30?Hz). Peak accelerations and stance phase durations (limb preparation, hoof landing {heel-strike and slide}, support, and grab) were compared using a mixed model analysis of covariance with surface, lead, stride frequency, and interaction fixed effects, and horse random effect. Results Peak dorsopalmar accelerations were 40% greater during landing on the synthetic surface (P?=?0.06). Grab phase was 32% shorter on the synthetic surface (P?=?0.02), with 34% less dorsopalmar impulse/mass (P<0.01). Previously reported failure shear stress of the synthetic surface was 20% greater, compared to dirt (normal stress >400?kN/m2, equivalent to trotting racehorse). Conclusions Dorsopalmar hoof accelerations were greater on the surface with greater shear strength (synthetic). The finding that accelerations were greater on the synthetic surface compared to dirt is in contrast to that of trotting horses on all-weather waxed and crushed sand surfaces. This discrepancy may be due to differences in horse gait, but also large variability in surfaces. Consequently, it is important to quantify surface behaviors to understand the effect of surface design and maintenance on limb biomechanics and propensity for injury.

AB  - Introduction Weighted boots and unnaturally high and long hooves (SH) are used to improve the 4-beat rhythm of the tölt and enhance forelimb action. Methods The effect of these methods on loading and movement of the limbs was investigated in thirteen Icelandic horses at walk, tölt and trot on an instrumented treadmill. Vertical ground reaction forces and kinematic data of fore- and hindlimbs were measured. Four conditions were differentiated: SN (standard shoeing) and SH, without and with weighted boots of 240?g (WB240), respectively. Differences were tested using one-way repeated measures ANOVA, separately for each gait (P<0.05). Results At the tölt, in both shoeing styles, WB240 increased protraction height of the forelimbs by about 13%. The weight gain of 273?g at the distal limb induced by changing SN to SH had a similar and cumulative effect. Hoof length alone was also positively, but not significantly, associated with protraction height; the combination of SH and WB240 resulted in an increase of up to 35%. Lateral coupling (pace-like rhythm) in tölt was reduced only with a combination of SH and WB240. Stride impulse increased with a change of hoof conformation alone at tölt, and combined with weight at all three gaits. Shorter relative stance durations in the forelimbs particularly at faster speeds resulted only in a minor increase of peak forces (+1.4%) due to an impulse shift to the hindlimbs. Conclusions Weight, particularly in combination with SH, improved gait performance and marginally increased limb peak forces. However, enhanced inertial forces during swing might additionally stress internal distal limb structures.

AB  - Introduction Showjumping (SJ) horses are at increased risk of distal forelimb soft tissue injuries; generally attributed to limb loading on landing. This study investigated relationships between the back, trailing limb angles at take-off, in flight and at landing. Methods Eight showjumpers jumped a 140?cm vertical obstacle (part of a 15-fence course). Two-dimensional high-speed motion-capture (250?Hz) was used to measure limb and regional back kinematics in the dorsoventral plane from markers placed at predetermined locations. Pearson's correlation tests were used to determine associations between limb and back angles at take-off, in flight and upon landing. Results All markers were clearly visible throughout. Greater head-neck ventroflexion at take-off was associated with decreased hock flexion (r?=?-0.81, P?=?0.0141), and decreased neck-trunk angle on landing (r?=?0.77, P?=?0.03). Greater head-neck ventroflexion at landing, 50% and 75% flight was associated with decreased carpal extension on landing (r?=?0.81, 0.84, 0.73; P?=?0.02, 0.01, 0.04 respectively). Increased thoracolumbar and lumbosacral flexion at take-off was associated with decreased metatarsophalangeal joint extension upon landing (r?=?0.78, 0.75; P?=?0.03). Greater lumbosacral flexion at 50 and 75% flight (r?=?-0.73, ?0.77; P?=?0.04, 0.03 respectively) and greater thoracolumbar flexion at 25, 50 and 75% flight was associated with decreased elbow flexion on landing (r?=?-0.87, ?0.78, ?0.76; P?=?0.01, 0.02, 0.03 respectively). Conclusions Decreasing head-neck angle and increasing thoracolumbar and lumbosacral flexion at take-off and in flight appeared to alter peak joint flexion and extension on landing. This suggests that optimising jumping technique in training may be beneficial to reduce the strain placed on the limbs at landing, which could potentially be valuable given the risk of distal limb soft tissue injuries in SJ horses.

Methods 8 horses walked in water level with the hoof, fetlock, hock and stifle. Reflective markers over the dorsal spinous processes of T6, T10, T13, T18, L3, L5 and S3 and left and right tuber coxae were used to measure flexion-extension range of movement (F-E ROM) around T10, T13, T18, L3 and L5, vertical displacement of the pelvis (Pelvic ROM) and vertical distance between T13 and L5 (lowest and highest point of the back). 3D coordinates were tracked using ProReflex cameras. 5?9 strides were analysed for each horse at each water height. Repeated measures ANOVA and post hoc tests were used to determine differences in measured variables between water heights (P < 0.05). Results Peak flexion of T10, T13, T18 and L3 occurred in hock height water. Peak extension of T18, L3 and L5 occurred in stifle height water without a significant difference in F-E ROM between water heights (P>0.05). Pelvic ROM was greatest in stifle height water, with no significant difference between water heights. The vertical distance between T13 and L5 was greatest in stifle height water (P<0.05 between hoof and hock height water) as a result of an elevation of L5 relative to T13. Conclusions As water height increases L5 is elevated relative to T13, increasing the tendency for extension of the thoracolumbar spine. To maximise thoracolumbar flexion and avoid extension, water at hock height is more beneficial then stifle height water.

AB  - Introduction The Accutrend? Lactate (formerly Accusport?) is a low cost point-of-care L-lactate analyser. The analyser is widely used in the training of horses and has been used for research studies and to assist the clinical management of critically ill horses. The analyser is reported to be linear from 0.8?22.0?mmol/L (blood) and 0.7?26.0?mmol/L (plasma); however, test performance at high L-lactate concentrations in equine blood and plasma has not been well documented. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of the Accutrend? Lactate analyzer over a wide range of L-lactate concentrations in paired blood and plasma samples. Methods Duplicate jugular blood samples were collected from 8 trained Standardbreds before, during, and after a simulated race on a treadmill into 4?mL partially evacuated tubes containing lithium heparin. Blood and plasma L-lactate concentrations were measured using a colorimetric lactate-oxidase mediated reaction (BM-Lactate? test strips and Accutrend? Lactate) and the reference enzymatic method (L-lactic dehydrogenase spectrophotometry at 340?nm using samples deproteinized with 8% perchloric acid). Data was analysed using Deming regression and Bland-Altman plots adjusted for repeated measures (P<0.05). Results The reference method measured a wide range of L-lactate concentrations in 128 blood (0.2?23.8?mmol/L) and 127 plasma (0.3?41.1?mmol/L) samples. The Accutrend? Lactate analyzer provided an accurate method of L-lactate measurement, but only when blood and plasma L-lactate concentrations were <12.5?mmol/L (79% of samples) and <15.0?mmol/L (64% of samples), respectively. Conclusions Blood L-lactate concentrations >12.5?mmol/L and plasma L-lactate concentrations >15.0?mmol/L measured by the Accutrend? Lactate analyzer underestimate the true value by a variable amount when compared with the enzymatic reference method.

AB  - Introduction During canter and gallop most horses maintain a locomotor-respiratory coupling (LRC) ratio of one breath every stride. Occasional big respiratory cycles (BRC) are described when a single breath is taken over two strides. This is considered a transient but normal feature of ventilation. However, a change to a more persistent 2:1 LRC ratio is considered to be ?abnormal?. It has been suggested that upper respiratory tract (URT) disorders could result in a horse adopting an abnormal breathing pattern, although current information is limited. Methods Simultaneous audio and URT endoscopy recordings from 365 horses referred for treadmill evaluation were analysed. Breathing pattern at canter and gallop was categorised at each one minute speed step: Normal: 1:1 with <2 BRC Normal: 1:1 with 2 BRC Abnormal: breathing pattern disrupted by repetitive and frequent BRC's Abnormal: alternating between periods of 2:1 and 1:1 Abnormal: 2:1 throughout Data analysis was performed using PASW 18.0. A chi-square test was used to identify associations between breathing pattern and presence of URT obstructions. Results During the entire exercise test 30% of horses had an abnormal breathing pattern at canter or gallop, of which 23% had a 2:1 breathing pattern. The prevalence of abnormal breathing patterns was higher at low canter speeds than during strenuous exercise. There was a significant association between breathing pattern during strenuous exercise and the presence of an URT obstruction (P?=?0.008). Conclusions Loss of a 1:1 LRC ratio during canter and gallop is more common than previously realised and may be associated with dynamic URT obstructions.

AB  - Introduction Chuckwagon racing involves 4 Thoroughbred horses pulling a 600?kg wagon through a figure-8 pattern and running a 1000?m dash. Horses can race four days in a row and there are concerns regarding the contribution of cumulative racing to electrolyte imbalances, arrhythmias, and sudden death, and its impact on recovery. The objective was to investigate the effects of cumulative racing on plasma electrolytes, lactate and prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias. Methods 148 horses (9.0?±?2.7 years) from 13 teams were monitored for heart rate and ECG activity on racing days 1 and 2. Differences in plasma electrolytes, pH and lactate (pre-vs. post-exercise and between days) were analysed (paired t-test). Associations between electrolytes and the presence of arrhythmias during racing and recovery (Pearson correlation) were examined. Results 377 ECGs (82 incomplete due to lost electrode) and 750 plasma samples (374 pre, 376 post) were analysed. 4235 arrhythmic events (21.6% warm-up, 37.6% racing, 20.4% recovery) were recorded and were not different between days 1 and 2. They mainly comprised supraventricular premature contractions during warm-up and racing (48% and 81.4% respectively) and ventricular premature contractions during recovery (29.2%). A significant association was found between post-exercise electrolytes and the presence of arrhythmias during racing (P<0.001, r?=?0.17). Consecutive racing significantly increased post-exercise lactate on day 2 (P<0.001). Pre-exercise pH and electrolytes were significantly different on day 2. Conclusions An association exists between post-exercise electrolytes and occurrence of arrhythmias during consecutive racing, however it is of little clinical significance. Ventricular arrhythmias are as prevalent in chuckwagon horses as in other disciplines. Overall, repetitive racing is well tolerated.

AB  - Introduction There are no published studies that characterize the different myofiber types of Mangalarga (ML) horses and hybrids. This study aimed to characterize and compare muscle fibers of the gluteus medius of ML mares and young and inactive mules resulting from the breeding of these mares with a Brazilian donkey. Methods Percutaneous biopsies were performed in 11 mares and their foals (10 mules), at a depth of 60?mm. Fiber types were determined by comparing identical images using both the staining techniques of myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase (mATPase) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR). Stains for mATPase were pre-incubated in acid medium followed by alkaline incubation. The frequency (F%) and relative total area (RTA%) of fiber types I, IIA and IIX were analysed. The cross-sectional area (CSA, ?m2) was quantified by the NADH-TR technique. The means were compared using ANOVA followed by Tukey test (P<0.05). Results The frequency of type IIA fibers was greater than types I and IIX. Type IIX fibers had higher CSA than I and IIA. The RTA of type IIX fibers was greater than type IIA fibers followed by type I. The higher RTA value of IIX fibers resulted from higher CSA. There was no difference between the variables for mares compared to the mules. Conclusions ML mares and mules that resulted from breeding with the Brazilian donkey have a high prevalence of type IIA fibers in the gluteus medius. This fatigue-resistant fiber uses both metabolic pathways, glycolytic and oxidative, to obtain energy during muscle contraction, thus giving the ML mares and mules good performance in horseback riding, marching contests and endurance rides.

AB  - Introduction Furosemide is widely administered to Thoroughbred and Standardbred racehorses to reduce the incidence and severity of EIPH. The magnitude and duration of mineral loss following furosemide administration has not previously been measured in horses. Methods Six fit Thoroughbreds (age 6.8?±?1.2?y; bwt 585?±?19?kg) were used in a 3?x?3 Latin square design trial to measure the effect of furosemide on urinary and fecal mineral excretion for 24?h before (?24?h) and 24?h, 48?h and 72?h after a standardized exercise test (SET) on an inclined (3o) high speed treadmill. The treatment groups consisted of an untreated control (C) and two groups (F and FE) which received furosemide (0.5?mg/kg, IV) 4?h before the SET. C and F were fed 60?g/d NaCl and (FE) was fed 200?g/d of an electrolyte mix (14?g?K, 37.7?g?Na and 43.3?g?Cl) for 21 days before the SET. Following the SET the FE group was supplemented with an additional 10?g/d?Ca and 10?g/d?Mg. Results Urinary Ca, P, Na and Cl excretion increased 24?h post treatment in the F and FE groups (P<0.05). 72?h?Ca and Cl balance was decreased in F (P<0.05) and 72?h?Mg and Cl balance was decreased in FE (P<0.05). The digestibility of P and Mg was decreased in FE (P<0.05) and Na digestibility was increased in F and FE (P<0.05). Conclusions A single dose of furosemide negatively affected calcium balance in horses for 72?h post administration. Further research is needed to assess the effect of chronic furosemide use in racehorses on mineral balance and soundness.

AB  - Introduction This study aimed to investigate the possibility of obtaining the beginning and end of stance from a girth-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), by comparing data from the IMU with data from an opto-electronic system. Methods 15 horses were trotted on a treadmill, with markers on hooves and a Girth Marker (GM) on a wireless IMU over the sternum. Proreflex cameras collected 3D marker data. T-tests and Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) were used to decipher any difference between diagonally paired limbs; GM and hoof markers; and GM and IMU, the limits of agreement of which were also assessed using a Bland Altman method. Results Timings of diagonally-coupled limbs were not significantly different at beginning (P?=?0.77 and 0.95), or end of stance (P?= 0.60 and 0.46) for right or left diagonal respectively. The diagonal in stance was identifiable from GM y position, with which IMU derived position had 97%, and IMU roll 100% agreement. Stance according to hoof markers did not differ significantly from GM z acceleration at beginning (P?= 0.49?±?0.01, P?= 0.92?±?0.007), or GM z velocity at end (P?= 0.84?±?0.007, P?= 0.83?±?0.007), in right or left diagonal respectively. A strong correlation was seen between beginning and end of stance according to GM and IMU events (each R2>0.99). Relationships between IMU and GM amplitudes were less convincing, with a significant difference at peak acceleration (P<0.05, Standard Deviation?=?2.70?m/s/s, ULOA?=?5.93, LLOA?=??4.66). Conclusions A girth-based IMU can identify temporal stride characteristics in trot on a treadmill, but inferences from amplitude data should be treated with caution until further investigated.

AB  - Introduction Kissing Spines Syndrome (KSS) represents a major challenge in equine practice. Radiographic examination of dorsal spinous processes (DSP) is therefore often included in sale and insurance cases and in diagnosis of back problems. Measurement of interspinous spaces (ISS) on radiographs is often used when evaluating DSPs. Radiographic examination of the equine back usually consists of two to four images causing beam angle differences between the image center and image borders. In addition, radiographs are 2D representations of 3D structures causing superimposition of anatomical structures. The aim of this study was to investigate if x-ray beam angle and superimposition affect radiographic evaluation of ISSs. Methods Beam angle effect was investigated using latero-lateral radiographs of the thoracic DSPs. Importance of superimposition of anatomical structures was investigated by comparing radiographic measurements with measurements in comparable CT and MR images. Cadaver backs from six horses were included. Four had a diagnosis of KSS, while two were considered normal. Backs were placed in an upright position on a flat surface for all images. Data were analysed using a linear mixed model with a single random factor, ISS. Significance was set at P<0.05. Results X-ray beam angle significantly influenced measurement of ISS (P<0.02) with differences of up to 2?mm, when measured three positions apart. ISS widths measured in radiographs were significantly lower than in comparable CT (P<0.0001) and MR (P<0.0001) images with differences of up to 3?mm. Conclusions These findings suggest that radiographic assessment may result in incorrect evaluation of ISSs. Ethical Animal Research Cadaver material was included in the study with signed consent from the horse owners.
