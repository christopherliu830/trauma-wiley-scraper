AB  - Islands are the challenging targets of a global pursuit in the closing of gaps, their distinct geography so far having seemingly eluded and mocked both human ingenuity and terra firma. This article seeks to deconstruct the concept of the bridge as more than just a value-free symbol of inexorable technological progress, and uses islands as the reference point to flesh out such an argument. Bridges impact on the subtle balance between the characteristic ?local?global? nature of an island identity; such an impact is multi-faceted, complex and case-specific. These ideas are applied to the specific case of the Confederation Bridge, the 14-km structure linking Prince Edward Island to New Brunswick, and which celebrated its tenth anniversary in June 2007.

AB  - Summary We proposed that many Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients would be hypothermic in the early postoperative period and that hypothermia would be associated with increased mortality. We retrospectively reviewed patients admitted to ICU after surgery. We recorded the lowest temperature in the first 24?h after surgery using tympanic membrane thermometers. We defined hypothermia as <?36?°C, and severe hypothermia as <?35?°C. We studied 5050 consecutive patients: 35% were hypothermic and 6% were severely hypothermic. In-hospital mortality was 5.6% for normothermic patients, 8.9% for all hypothermic patients (p?<?0.001), and 14.7% for severely hypothermic patients (p?<?0.001). Hypothermia was associated with in-hospital mortality: OR 1.83 for each degree Celsius (°C) decrease (95% CI: 1.2?2.60, p?<?0.001). Given the evidence for improved outcome associated with active patient warming during surgery we suggest conducting prospective studies of active warming of patients admitted to ICU after surgery.

AB  - Summary Seventeen Thoroughbred horses with moderate to severe gastric ulceration were purchased from a race track within 10 days of racing and were treated once daily with either omeprazole (9 horses) or vehicle (8 horses) and evaluated gastroscopically for ulcer healing. Horses were administered omeprazole (1.5 mg/kg bwt/day) or vehicle by nasogastric tube once daily. Gastroscopic examination was performed on Days 0, 4, 7, 11, 14, 17, 21, 24 and 28, until lesions healed completely. Selected images of gastric lesions were captured by computer at each endoscopic examination, with a measuring caliper included in captured images. The area and perimeter of lesions were measured by computer and healing rates of specific lesions were determined by calculating the rate of linear advance of the margins toward the centre of the lesion. Additionally, the number of days to complete healing of the entire gastric squamous mucosa was compared between treatment groups. Gastric lesions healed at a significantly faster rate in horses receiving omeprazole than in vehicle-treated horses (P<0.001). Complete healing of the entire stomach occurred in 10?21 days in omeprazole-treated horses, and 14?28 days in 3 of 8 vehicle-treated horses, with the remaining vehicle-treated horses having unhealed lesions on Day 28. In addition, 5 vehicle-treated horses developed new lesions in the squamous epithelial mucosa during the trial; no new lesions were observed in the omeprazole-treated group.

AB  - SUMMARY Mortality reports were studied for 181 shipments of live sheep from Western Australia to the Middle East and Singapore in 1985 and 1986. Samples of pelleted feed for 93 shipments were analysed for quality. Overall death rate in the 6.46 million sheep exported in the period of the study was 2.18%. In sheep bound for the Middle East, most of the deaths occurred during the voyage (overall rate 1.7%, range 0.4-4.4% per shipment), although substantial mortality was recorded during discharge (rate 0.4%, range 0.0-1.8%). There were few deaths during loading (rate 0.07%, range 0.0?0.8%). Deaths in sheep bound for Singapore were almost 10-fold lower than those sent to the Middle East. Several findings suggested that ship design and management may contribute to mortality. Death rates were invariably low on some ships and often high on others. Death rates were nearly always higher in enclosed decks than in open decks on 4 vessels, and point epidemics of mortality were observed in several shipments. Temperature and relative humidity measured on the ship's bridge were not closely related to daily death rate. Antibiotics estimated to cost $226,000 were used during 33 voyages in 1986 and were considered of dubious efficacy on shipboard mortality. Analysis of feed pellets used on ship showed that the quality of the diet was within the range set by draft national standards for pellets used in the live sheep export industry.

AB  - Abstract Body awareness and reactivity dysfunction are characteristic of a range of psychiatric disorders. Although the neural pathways communicating between the body and brain that contribute to these experiences involve the autonomic nervous system, few research tools for studying subjective bodily experiences have been informed by these neural circuits. This paper describes the factor structure, reliability, and convergent validity of the Body Awareness and Autonomic Reactivity subscales of the Body Perception Questionnaire-Short Form (BPQ-SF). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were applied to data from three samples collected via the internet in Spain and the US and a college population in the US (combined n = 1320). Body awareness was described by a single factor. Autonomic reactivity reflected unique factors for organs above and below the diaphragm. Subscales showed strong reliability; converged with validation measures; and differed by age, sex, medication use, and self-reported psychiatric disorder. Post hoc analyses were used to create the 12-item Body Awareness Very Short Form. Results are discussed in relation to the distinct functions of supra- and sub-diaphragmatic autonomic pathways as proposed by the Polyvagal Theory and their potential dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: MP3 recorders are readily available, small, lightweight and low cost, providing the potential for logging analogue hoof mounted accelerometer signals for the characterisation of equine locomotion. These, however, require testing in practice. Objectives: To test whether 1) multiple MP3 recorders can maintain synchronisation, giving the ability to synchronise independent recorders for the logging of multiple limbs simultaneously; and 2) features of a foot mounted accelerometer signal attributable to foot-on and foot-off can be accurately identified from horse foot mounted accelerometers logged directly into an MP3 recorder. Methods: Three experiments were performed: 1) Maintenance of synchronisation was assessed by counting the number of samples recorded by each of 4 MP3 recorders while mounted on a trotting horse and over 2 consecutive 30 min periods in 8 recorders on a bench. 2) Foot-on and foot-off times obtained from manual transcription of MP3 logged data and directly logged accelerometer signal were compared. 3) MP3/accelerometer acquisition units were used to log accelerometer signals from racehorses during extended training sessions. Results: Mean absolute error of synchronisation between MP3 recorders was 10 samples per million (compared to mean number of samples, range 1?32 samples per million). Error accumulation showed a linear correlation with time. Features attributable to foot on and foot off were equally identifiable from the MP3 recorded signal over a range of equine gaits. Conclusions: Multiple MP3 recorders can be synchronised and used as a relatively cheap, robust, reliable and accurate logging system when combined with an accelerometer and external battery for the specific application of the measurement of stride timing variables across the range of equine gaits during field locomotion. Potential relevance: Footfall timings can be used to identify intervals between the fore and hind contacts, the identification of diagonal advanced placement and to calculate stride timing variables (stance time, protraction time and stride time). These parameters are invaluable for the characterisation and assessment of equine locomotion.

AB  - Summary Surgical procedures in ferrets are similar to those performed in dogs and cats, and require tools such as microsurgical instruments, magnifying loupes, smaller suture sizes, body temperature support devices, and smaller retractors. This chapter discusses surgical diseases and various surgeries, including abdominal surgery, hepatobiliary surgery, ovariohysterectomy, and anal sacculectomy. Many of the surgical diseases presented require aggressive and challenging operative procedures. Some form of magnification is recommended for surgery in patients weighing less than 1 kg. The major disadvantage of performing surgery under magnification is that it generally requires more time to complete a procedure. Surgical diseases of the gallbladder of the ferret are not common; however, cholecystotomy and cholecystecomy are the most common extrahepatic biliary tract (EHBT) surgeries performed. One such technique, craniotomy, is described in detail. Ferrets tolerate such procedures well.

AB  - Abstract Cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and lymphotoxin-α, have been described widely to play important roles in the brain in physiologic conditions and after traumatic injury. However, the exact mechanisms involved in their function have not been fully elucidated. We give some insight on their role by using animals lacking either Type 1 receptor (TNFR1KO) or Type 2 (TNFR2KO) and their controls (C57Bl/6). Both TNFR1KO and to a greater extent TNFR2KO mice showed increased exploration/activity neurobehavioral traits in the hole board test, such as rearings, head dippings, and ambulations, compared with wild-type mice, suggesting an inhibitory role of TNFR1/TNFR2 signaling. In contrast, no significant differences were observed in the elevated plus maze test, ruling out a major role of these receptors in the control of anxiety. We next evaluated the response to a freeze injury to the somatosensorial cortex. The effect of the cryolesion on motor function was evaluated with the horizontal ladder beam test, and the results showed that both TNFR1KO and TNFR2KO mice made fewer errors, suggesting a detrimental role for TNFR1/TNFR2 signaling for coping with brain damage. Expression of ?22600 genes was analyzed using an Affymetrix chip (MOE430A) at 0 (unlesioned), 1, or 4 days post-lesion in the three strains. The results show a unique and major role of both TNF receptors on the pattern of gene expression elicited by the injury but also in normal conditions, and suggest that blocking of TNFR1/TNFR2 receptors may be beneficial after a traumatic brain injury. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary This paper describes and compares three techniques of categorisation of hay, straw and other feeds and beddings collected from stables. A hand-held sampler was used to categorise samples according to the presence of plant material, fungal spores and dust mites. An Andersen sampler was used to categorise samples according to the thermotolerances of fungi and actinomycetes. An aerodynamic particle sizer was used to categorise samples according to respirable particle release rates. The highest burden of respirable particles was associated with the presence of thermophilic and thermotolerant actinomycetes and fungi. The portable slit sampler proved to be an accurate, quick and simple semiquantitative method of assessing the mould contamination of source materials. This latter technique requires only a microscope and the sampler, and is thus ideal for veterinary practices and small diagnostic laboratories.

AB  - ABSTRACT Lung infections caused by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can present as a spectrum of clinical entities from a rapidly fatal pneumonia in a neutropenic patient to a multi-decade bronchitis in patients with cystic fibrosis. P. aeruginosa is ubiquitous in our environment, and one of the most versatile pathogens studied, capable of infecting a number of diverse life forms and surviving harsh environmental factors. It is also able to quickly adapt to new environments, including the lung, where it orchestrates virulence factors to acquire necessary nutrients, and if necessary, turn them off to prevent immune recognition. Despite these capabilities, P. aeruginosa rarely infects healthy human lungs. This is secondary to a highly evolved host defence mechanism that efficiently removes inhaled or aspirated pseudomonads. Many arms of the respiratory host defence have been elucidated using P. aeruginosa as a model pathogen. Human infections with P. aeruginosa have demonstrated the importance of the mechanical barrier functions including mucus clearance, and the innate immune system, including the critical role of the neutrophilic response. As more models of persistent or biofilm P. aeruginosa infections are developed, the role of the adaptive immune response will likely become more evident. Understanding the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa, and the respiratory host defence response to it has, and will continue to, lead to novel therapeutic strategies to help patients.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Tools and criteria to evaluate and understand glucose metabolism are essential to optimise equine energy utilisation for exercise performance and reduced metabolic health risks. Objectives: To re-evaluate models of glucose kinetics in the horse at rest and during endurance type exercise using a single injection technique and compartmental modelling. Methods: Twelve exercise trained Arabian geldings received a bolus of 100?µmol/kg bwt [6,6-2H]glucose i.v. while at rest and while running at ?4?m/s on a treadmill. Tracer and tracee glucose curves from 4?150?min after the bolus dose (while the subject maintained its resting or exercising state) were described by a 2 term exponential decay curve. Compartmental modelling was performed simultaneously for each horse's resting and exercise curves using an ?exercise effect? parameter for each compartmental exchange rate during exercise. Results: Exercise increased all rate constants and transport flows for glucose between compartments by 110?145% (P≤0.004). Total glucose transport through the system increased from 8.9 ± 0.6?µmol/min/kg/bwt at rest to 25.0 ± 1.1?µmol/min/kg bwt during exercise (P<0.001). Exercise decreased the volume of the primary glucose compartment by 8% (P = 0.006) and increased plasma glucose clearance rate by almost 200% (P<0.001). Turnover times and mean residence times were decreased approximately 60% by exercise (P<0.001), whilst turnover rates were increased 125% (P<0.001). Conclusions: Single-injection tracer kinetics and compartmental modelling represent a valuable tool to quantify tracee availability to and use by tissue. Potential relevance: This technique could represent a beneficial tool for future studies exploring the role of glucose metabolism in equine exercise performance and metabolic disease.

AB  - Abstract Coelomic fluid aspiration has been utilized in echinoderms in research and clinical settings. Detailed procedural descriptions for coelomic fluid sampling in sea urchins (class Echinoidea) are lacking, and samples are prone to contamination. The objectives of this study were to (1) standardize a technique for coelomic fluid collection in long-spined sea urchin Diadema antillarum that optimizes the diagnostic quality of the sample utilizing diagnostic imaging, (2) identify coelomic fluid bacterial isolates (using Biolog GEN III MicroLog and 16s rDNA sequencing), and (3) compare positive cultures to animal weight, holding time prior to sampling, water temperature, and gross fluid appearance. Seventy Diadema antillarum from the Florida Keys collected in two groups (March and September 2015) were utilized. Positive cultures for bacterial contamination were identified in 5% and 44%, respectively, of animals in the sampling groups. Vibrio spp. was the predominant genus identified. Positive cultures were more frequent in the group with smaller-sized animals, increased holding times, and elevated water temperatures. Deviation from clear-pink gross coelomic fluid appearance did not reliably predict bacterial contamination. A standardized technique for coelomocentesis was defined. The use of the proposed coelomocentesis methodology may facilitate improved health evaluations of sea urchins and may be applicable to research, conservation efforts, and disease investigations.

AB  - Abstract Non-thermal gas plasmas (NTGPs) are a promising emergent medical technology.a Unlike thermal plasmas, they generate a complex room temperature mix of reactive species which interact with tissues. The characterization of candidate plasmas and their interaction with tissues has shown that they produce a variety of broadly dose dependent effects ranging from fibroblast proliferation to angiogenesis and bacterial destruction. These findings, supported by recent experiments using skin models, suggest that NTGP's could potentially play an important role in both decontaminating acute and chronic wounds and accelerating healing. However, important issues over toxicological and environmental safety remain unanswered and a number of regulatory and technical hurdles will need to be overcome before a NTGP medical device is released.

The ecology of V. vulnificus in seawater is markedly affected by temperature and salinity. The role of phage in the ecology of V. vulnificus remains poorly defined but has been proposed as a potential remedial method to reduce V. vulnificus and target pathogenic strains in post-harvest shellfish. PCR and gene probe methods are available as confirmatory tests for V. vulnificus. When these phenotypic methods are used, V. vulnificus can be differentiated from non-Vibrio using TSI, KIA, and arginine glucose slants, oxidation- fermentation and oxidase tests, and various other methods. The US food and drug administration (FDA) produced a risk assessment that is used to control growth of V. vulnificus through post-harvest time?temperature control.

AB  - Abstract Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of the bone is a high-grade sarcoma characterized histologically by the composition of fibroblasts and pleomorphic cells with a prominent storiform pattern. Despite institution of multi-modality treatments, the prognosis for patients with this tumor remains unsatisfactory. In the present study, towards the goal of developing active immunotherapy for those affected, we established four cell lines from a 53-year-old woman who suffered from MFH of the humerus with lymph node metastases. MFH2003 and MFH2003-B7.1 were the primary lesion-derived cell line and its B7.1-transfectant, respectively. B2003-EBV and TIL2003 were a B cell line established from peripheral blood lymphocytes and a T cell line established from tumor-invaded lymph nodes, respectively. MFH2003 cells could be maintained over a period of 1 year in vitro, and could be xenotransplanted into nude mice. The phenotype of cells analyzed by immunostaining was similar to the original tumor. TIL2003 cells were all CD8+ and specifically recognized MFH2003 cells and MFH2003-B7.1 cells, but not B2003-EBV cells. An anti-HLA-class I monoclonal antibody completely blocked the anti-MFH2003 response of TILs2003. These findings indicate the existence of an anti-MFH specific immune response in the microenvironment of metastatic lymph nodes. The present autologous cell lines provide the basis for identification of novel tumor-associated antigens and may be helpful in the establishment of immunotherapy for patients with MFH of the bone. ? 2005 Orthopaedic Research Society.
