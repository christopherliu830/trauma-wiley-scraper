AB  - Abstract Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of the bone is a high-grade sarcoma characterized histologically by the composition of fibroblasts and pleomorphic cells with a prominent storiform pattern. Despite institution of multi-modality treatments, the prognosis for patients with this tumor remains unsatisfactory. In the present study, towards the goal of developing active immunotherapy for those affected, we established four cell lines from a 53-year-old woman who suffered from MFH of the humerus with lymph node metastases. MFH2003 and MFH2003-B7.1 were the primary lesion-derived cell line and its B7.1-transfectant, respectively. B2003-EBV and TIL2003 were a B cell line established from peripheral blood lymphocytes and a T cell line established from tumor-invaded lymph nodes, respectively. MFH2003 cells could be maintained over a period of 1 year in vitro, and could be xenotransplanted into nude mice. The phenotype of cells analyzed by immunostaining was similar to the original tumor. TIL2003 cells were all CD8+ and specifically recognized MFH2003 cells and MFH2003-B7.1 cells, but not B2003-EBV cells. An anti-HLA-class I monoclonal antibody completely blocked the anti-MFH2003 response of TILs2003. These findings indicate the existence of an anti-MFH specific immune response in the microenvironment of metastatic lymph nodes. The present autologous cell lines provide the basis for identification of novel tumor-associated antigens and may be helpful in the establishment of immunotherapy for patients with MFH of the bone. ? 2005 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Ruminant livestock provides meat and dairy products that sustain health and livelihood for much of the world's population. Grazing lands that support ruminant livestock provide numerous ecosystem services, including provision of food, water, and genetic resources; climate and water regulation; support of soil formation; nutrient cycling; and cultural services. In the U.S. southern Great Plains, beef production on pastures, rangelands, and hay is a major economic activity. The region's climate is characterized by extremes of heat and cold and extremes of drought and flooding. Grazing lands occupy a large portion of the region's land, significantly affecting carbon, nitrogen, and water budgets. To understand vulnerabilities and enhance resilience of beef production, a multi-institutional Coordinated Agricultural Project (CAP), the ?grazing CAP,? was established. Integrative research and extension spanning biophysical, socioeconomic, and agricultural disciplines address management effects on productivity and environmental footprints of production systems. Knowledge and tools being developed will allow farmers and ranchers to evaluate risks and increase resilience to dynamic conditions. The knowledge and tools developed will also have relevance to grazing lands in semiarid and subhumid regions of the world.

AB  - Summary There is limited information on long-term follow-up and prognostic indicators for horses diagnosed with equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis (EMPF). The objectives of this study were to describe the signalment, clinicopathological data, radiographic and ultrasonographic findings, equine herpesvirus-5 viral loads, clinical outcomes, and pathologic lesions associated with EMPF. Medical records from 2008 to 2016 were reviewed for this retrospective case series of 14 horses diagnosed with equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis on lung histopathology. Independent variables associated with survival to hospital discharge (short-term survival) were determined using Chi-square or Fisher?s exact test. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated when applicable. Short-term survival was 57%, with only 14% of cases surviving longer than 6 months after discharge. The odds of short-term survival were higher in horses administered corticosteroids (OR = 0.029, 95% CI 0.002-0.615; P = 0.026). Severity of thoracic radiographic changes and equine herpesvirus-5 viral loads measured by quantitative PCR in the lung on presentation were not associated with survival time. Severity of thoracic radiographic changes was also not correlated to equine herpesvirus-5 viral loads in the lung ante-mortem. Equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis has a poor prognosis for survival, with horses frequently displaying severe radiographic and histopathological changes at the time of diagnosis. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids reduced the odds of short-term mortality.

AB  - ABSTRACT Four related Chow Chow puppies which were presented because of stiffness in their movements were shown to have myotonia similar to myotonia congenita of man. Electromyography revealed characteristic myotonic discharges. Repetitive nerve stimulation studies showed a marked fade in the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) which was most apparent at stimulation rates of 10 per sec or higher. If stimulation was continued at a rate of 10 per sec the CMAP returned to normal or sometimes greater than normal following several seconds of the reduced response. The decremental response could be exaggerated by cooling the muscle prior to repetitive nerve stimulation. A therapeutic trial to assess the efficacy of the commonly used membrane stabilizing agents, quinidine, procainamide and phenytoin, indicated that all three drugs were beneficial in the treatment of myotonia but procainamide produced the best response. Hypocholesterolaemia was documented in one case. The possibility of a multisystem membrane defect in hereditary myotonia associated with low serum cholesterol was considered.

AB  - Musk, the dried secretion of the musk pod (sac) of adult male musk deer, has been used as traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in China and south-east Asian countries for thousands of years. Due to the anabolic steroid component in this TCM, musk preparations have been included in the list of medical products containing prohibited substances employed for doping by the State Food and Drug Administration of China. The application of musk pod formulation was claimed to be responsible for some adverse analytical findings (AAFs) in the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. Our preliminary study has suggested that musk ingestion did not lead to AAFs of doping control with the single dosage of 100 mg. However, the influences of musk administration in large and multi dosage are still unclear. The aim of this study is to further investigate the influences of musk administration for doping control. Wild and domestic deer musk samples were collected. The concentrations and δ13C-values of steroids in musk were analyzed. In an excretion study, 200 and 100 mg of wild and domestic deer musk samples were administrated by 29 subjects, respectively. Fluctuations in steroid profile could be observed, and the ratio of 5α-androstane-3α,17?-diol to 5?-androstane-3α,17?-diol was more sensitive than other parameters. In the IRMS test, the ??δ13C-value between endogenous reference compound and etiocholanolone was a sensitive parameter, and AAFs were obtained. It is the first time to confirm with excretion study that musk administration could lead to positive result of doping control. Copyright ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Non-thermal gas plasmas (NTGPs) are a promising emergent medical technology.a Unlike thermal plasmas, they generate a complex room temperature mix of reactive species which interact with tissues. The characterization of candidate plasmas and their interaction with tissues has shown that they produce a variety of broadly dose dependent effects ranging from fibroblast proliferation to angiogenesis and bacterial destruction. These findings, supported by recent experiments using skin models, suggest that NTGP's could potentially play an important role in both decontaminating acute and chronic wounds and accelerating healing. However, important issues over toxicological and environmental safety remain unanswered and a number of regulatory and technical hurdles will need to be overcome before a NTGP medical device is released.

AB  - Objective: To establish normal parameters of thromboelastography (TEG) in healthy adult cats. Background: Thromboelastography (TEG) is an in vitro test of coagulation that has been shown to be useful in humans, dogs and select species to identify and quantify alterations of hemostasis (e.g., hypercoagulable and hypocoagulable states). It has also been demonstrated to be useful in monitoring effects of anticoagulant therapies. This test has not been evaluated in cats. Methods: Blood was collected from 25 clinically normal cats by venipuncture using a 21 gauge?3 1/2 inch butterfly catheter and syringe for medial saphenous or jugular venipuncture. A single 1.8?mL sample in 3.8% Sodium Citrate (9:1) was collected from each cat. Recalcified whole blood was analyzed 30?minutes following collection with the TEG? 5000 analyzer (Haemoscope, Niles, IL). Analysis temperature was 37.6°C. TEG parameters recorded included: R-value (represents initial fibrin formation), K (time from R to standard fixed measure of clot firmness which represents contributions of platelets and fibrinogen), maximum amplitude (MA; represents absolute clot strength), and alpha angle (α; the slope of TEG tracing which represents rate of clot formation). The coagulation index (CI) was derived from the formula generated for humans to provide an overall assessment of whether the sample was hyper- or hypocoagulable. Results: Values for the 25 normal cat samples are reported as mean ±2 standard deviations. R=2.97; 1.23?4.72; K=1.54, 0.38?2.71; α=70.70, 57.76?83.65; MA=58.50, 45.26?71.74 and CI=2.27, 0.07?4.46. Compared to historical information obtained on normal dogs, cats have significantly shorter R and K and larger α, MA and CI. Conclusions: TEG does have reproducible performance when used to evaluate coagulation status in normal cats. Compared to dogs, normal cats favor a hypercoagulable state. Species-specific normal values are necessary for interpretation of TEG results. This test bears potential value for use in future experimental and clinical work to investigate hemostasis in cats receiving anticoagulant therapies or in cats suffering from diseases such as cardiomyopathy which are thought to be associated with altered coagulation status.

AB  - Summary Four horses (H, J, N and M) undertook a simulated competition exercise test (CET), designed to simulate physiological and metabolic stresses of the Speed and Endurance (S  30°C/40%RH (hot, dry [HD]) and 30°C/80%RH (hot, humid [HH]) (Marlin et al. 1995a). Venous blood samples for electrolyte and total protein (TP) determinations were collected from indwelling catheters at predetermined time points throughout each CET and initial 30 min recovery period. Venous blood samples were collected by jugular venepuncture at 2 h and 24 h after the end of the final 8 min canter (Phase D). The effects of exercise, environmental condition and horse on venous TP, sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl?), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+) and phosphate (PP43-) plasma concentrations were investigated. In addition, the effect of environmental condition on estimated cation loss was evaluated. All horses completed the full CET under the CD and HD conditions, but only one horse completed the full 8 min of the final canter Phase D under HH conditions. Exercise had a significant (P<0.05) effect on all parameters similar to those reported previously in field competitions. There was a significant (P<0.05) interaction between time and horse for TP, Na+ and Cl?. Overall, the environmental condition had a significant (P<0.05) effect on all parameters, but the differences were not considered to be of any physiological relevance, other than for Cl? and TP. There was a significant (P<0.05) interaction between time and environmental condition for Cl? and TP only. During much of the CET and recovery period, mean Cl? values were higher with the first CD session than the second CD session or under the HH or HD conditions. For TP after 2 min of Phase D and during the initial recovery period, concentrations were higher under the HH conditions and returned to the Pre- values less quickly. There were marked individual variations in the estimated cation losses and no consistent effect of environmental condition was found. Although estimated fluid loss was similar following both HD and HH sessions, restoration of bodyweight was slower following the CET studies under HH conditions.

AB  - Abstract Feeding problems are common even in typically developing infants and children. However, they are more frequent and persistent in children with developmental disabilities. This article will provide an overview of current literature and a rationale underlying the interventions used for children with cerebral palsy (CP) who have eating impairments (dysphagia). The review is not intended to be exhaustive, but papers were selected that highlight some of the issues and challenges of the field. Normal oral-motor development is briefly discussed to show how it may inform clinical practice in the understanding of feeding problems. Description of the risk factors and the nature and extent of eating impairments will show how interventions need to be specific to the severity of eating impairments. Examination of sensorimotor therapies, using oral stimulation exercises or an intra-oral appliance, will highlight the range of their effectiveness, as well as their limitations. Similarly, an examination of tube feeding, used for nutritional rehabilitation of the most severely affected children, will address the benefits, controversies as well as moral issues encountered by caregivers and professionals. Multi-center studies will be needed to obtain more homogeneous samples, large enough to address questions of early interventions and their subsequent effect on later development. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: The demands in the Standardbred trotters industry require young, still growing horses, to be trained well above light exercise level. During that period, the risk of occurrence of energy imbalance and maladaptation to training is high. In man, the lack of energy homeostasis is considered as the basic problem in the development of chronic fatigue. Objective: To find objective biomarkers of early maladaptation to training in young racehorses under field conditions. Materials and methods: Sixty-five 2-year-old Standardbreds were followed during their first 3 months of training in 5 different training centres. Monthly measurement of morphological variables (weight, height at withers, body condition score, body composition), basic haemato-biochemical variables and endocrine levels (testosterone, cortisol, thyroid hormones, leptin, IGF1, prolactin) were undertaken. Feeding levels and training programmes were also evaluated. At the end of the 3 month period, on the basis of an abnormal weight loss, 14 young horses were suspected of maladaptation to training (MT group). Morphological, haemato-biochemical, endocrine changes were compared between MT group (n = 14) and control group (C group, n = 40). Analysis of variance was calculated to study the effects of time and maladaptation to training. Results: Compared to C group, MT group showed a significant higher weight loss in relation to a higher loss of fat mass and body condition score (P<0.05). MT group presented higher GGT and white cell counts and lower red cell counts (P<0.05). Finally, MT group showed significant lower levels of T4 (P = 0.03) than C group. Conclusion: Some young horses presented signs of energy imbalance which were also associated with haematobiochemical and endocrine changes. Those markers might be useful for identification of maladaptation to training.

PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract Intensive or extensive culture of aquatic animals requires chemicals that control disease, enhance the growth of cultured species, reduce handling trauma to organisms, improve water quality, disinfect water, and control aquatic vegetation, predaceous insects, or other nuisance organisms. The aquaculture chemical needs for various species have been described for rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss; Atlantic and Pacific salmon, Salmo salar and Oncorhynchus sp.; channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus; striped bass, Morone saxatilis; milkfish, Chanos chanos; mollusks; penaeid shrimp; and a variety of other freshwater and marine species. Laws and regulations on the use of chemicals in aquaculture vary by country. Regulations and therapeutants or other chemicals that are approved or allowed for use in the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan, Chile, and Australia are presented herein. In the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulate the application of chemicals to organisms or to their environments. FDA controls the use of drugs and anesthetics, and EPA controls the application of chemicals and pesticides to the environment. Each agency develops appropriate guidelines and policies to implement the laws for its field of responsibility. Few therapeutants are registered in the United States for use on any cultured aquatic species. In the most critical area of antibacterials, only two (Terramycin for Fish and Romet-30) are approved and available. Formalin (Formalin-F, Parasite-S, Paracide-F) is the only registered fungicide and Paracide-F is the only formalin product currently labeled for use on eggs of all fish at 1000?2000 mg/L for 15 min. Formalin (Formalin-F, Parasite-S, Paracide-F) is the only parasiticide currently approved and available. Paracide-F is the only formalin product currently approved for use on all fish. Povidone-iodine compounds can be used to disinfect the surface of fish eggs because FDA has classified them as low regulatory priority substances. Water treatment compounds (potassium permanganate, calcium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium carbonate, calcium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, tris buffer, and sodium sulfite), anesthetics (tricaine, carbon dioxide gas, and sodium bicarbonate), herbicides (copper sulfate, chelated copper compounds, and diquat dibromide) and piscicides (antimycin and rotenone) are also registered and regulated. The control of aquaculture drugs varies according to country from no regulation to restrictive regulations. Generally, few requirements are needed for a therapeutant to be licensed or registered in Africa, and most of Asia and South America. Except for environmental studies, requirements for registration data in Canada are similar to requirements in the United States. However, Canada has significantly different regulations and approval processes. Canadian aquaculturalists use drugs that are either licensed for other food animals and prescribed by veterinarians or used in an emergency under the direction of the Canadian Bureau of Veterinary Drugs (BVD). Chemicals authorized for use in aquaculture in Canada include oxytetracycline, sulfadimethoxine and ormetoprim (Romet-30, Romet-B), and others. Chemicals authorized for use in aquaculture in certain European countries include ampicillin, chlortetracycline, and others. In Japan, registration of drugs for aquatic species requires the same data as those required for drugs on other animals. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forests, and Fisheries and the Ministry of Welfare control the use of chemicals and aquaculture in Japan. As of April 2001, more chemicals were registered for aquacultural use in Japan than in any other country. They include amoxicillin, ampicillin, florfenicol, tetracycline, thiamphenicol, eugenol, and hydrogen peroxide. More therapeutants and vaccines may soon be added to the medicine chest of fish farmers. Research has been conducted on important antibacterial compounds in the United States and the U.S. Geological Survey's Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center is working on several fronts to improve the availability of anesthetics, fungicides and parasiticides.

AB  - Summary The preparation, properties, and applications of shape memory polymer (SMP) systems composed of or containing biodegradable polyesters have been surveyed in this chapter. SMPs are capable of memorizing one or more temporary shapes and recovering to the permanent shape upon an external stimulus that is usually heat. SMPs were classified with respect to their molecular structure (homopolymers, copolymers, blends) and architecture (conetwork, interpenetrating network) in this review. A further distinction was made as to whether the related system was linear (thermoplastic) or cross-linked (thermoset). The underlying mechanisms of shape memory actions are introduced and discussed. Emphasis has been placed on presenting recent progress on shape memory biodegradable polyester systems and their potential for practical applications, especially in surgery. An attempt has been made to deduce the trends for future developments and applications.

AB  - Periodontitis in cats infrequently leads to facial abscess development but should always be considered as an underlying cause of this common problem. Without removal of the underlying cause of an abscess it will probably reoccur as soon as antibiotic or anti-inflammatory treatment ends. For this reason, it is important to identify dental disease as a possible underlying cause of these abscesses. This case demonstrates very effectively that an accurate diagnosis and the formulation of an effective treatment plan would be impossible without the use of intraoral radiography. The fact that no effective decisions about diagnosis and treatment of tooth resorption are possible without the use of radiography is underlined by this case.

AB  - Objectives To examine agreement in anaesthetised dogs between invasive blood pressure measurements and measurements obtained with an oscillometric blood pressure monitor. Materials and Methods Paired invasive and oscillometric measurements were taken in 24 dogs every 5 minutes during anaesthesia (9 to 37 measurements per dog). Agreement between measurement methods was explored using Bland?Altman plots. To determine the accuracy of the oscillometric measurements, the results were compared with the guidelines recommended by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine and the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. Results In total, 493 paired readings were obtained: 98·6% of oscillometric readings were successful. Biases (±standard deviation) for oscillometric readings of systolic arterial blood pressure and mean arterial blood pressure were 2·1 (±11·5) and ?9·8 (±7·6) mm Hg, indicating slight over- and under-estimation, respectively, versus invasive measurements. More than 50% and 80% of systolic arterial and mean arterial pressure measurements were within 10 and 20 mmHg of invasively measured values, respectively. A large negative bias (?14·1 ±9·2 mmHg) against invasive measurements revealed that the oscillometric measures of diastolic arterial blood pressure measurements were under-estimated. Clinical Significance In healthy adult anaesthetised dogs, this oscillometric monitor met the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine requirements for systolic arterial and mean arterial pressure measurement but failed to meet the requirements for the measurement of diastolic arterial pressure.

AB  - The nervous control of expiratory muscles is less well understood than that of the inspiratory muscles, particularly in the rat. The patterns of respiratory discharges in adult rats were therefore investigated for the muscles of the caudal intercostal spaces, with hypercapnia and under either anaesthesia or decerebration. With neuromuscular blockade and artificial ventilation, efferent discharges were present for both inspiration and expiration in both external and internal intercostal nerves. This was also the case for proximal internal intercostal nerve branches that innervate only internal intercostal and subcostalis muscles. If active, this region of muscle in other species is always expiratory. Here, inspiratory bursts were almost always present. The expiratory activity appeared only gradually and intermittently, when the anaesthesia was allowed to lighten or as the pre-decerebration anaesthesia wore off. The intermittent appearance is interpreted as the coupling of a slow medullary expiratory oscillator with a faster inspiratory one. The patterns of nerve discharges, in particular the inspiratory or biphasic activation of the internal and subcostalis layers, were confirmed by observations of equivalent patterns of EMG discharges in spontaneously breathing preparations, using denervation procedures to identify which muscles generated the signals. Some motor units were recruited in both inspiratory and expiratory bursts. These patterns of activity have not previously been described and have implications both for the functional role of multiple respiratory oscillators in the adult and for the mechanical actions of the muscles of the caudal intercostal spaces, including subcostalis, which is a partly bisegmental muscle.

AB  - ABSTRACT: This article describes the investigation of a calf pneumonia outbreak in a dairy herd and the practical steps taken to treat sick animals, as well as improve overall calf management. High levels of morbidity meant a blanket treatment approach with antibiotics and NSAIDs was taken for all calves. Key management changes were made in calving pens, colostrum management was improved, changes to ventilation in calf sheds were made, and a protocol for feeding calves was drawn up.
