AB  - SUMMARY: Culture-negative peritoneal inflammation accounts for between 5 and 20% of cases of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients. Diagnostic yields may be enhanced considerably by reculturing dialysate effluents using appropriate collection methods and optimal laboratory techniques (including prolonged low-temperature and anaerobic incubations). In patients with persistent culture-negative peritonitis, consideration should be given to the possibilities of unusual or fastidious microorganisms (especially fungi and mycobacteria) and non-infective causes (especially drug reactions, malignancy, visceral inflammation and retroperitoneal inflammation). In this paper, an illustrative case of persistent culture-negative peritonitis is presented followed by a discussion of the investigative approach to such patients, with particular emphasis on differential diagnosis and the limitations of currently available tests.

AB  - Summary Iron is of key importance for aerobic metabolism, and natural feeds of the horse are fairly rich sources of iron. Accordingly, the known incidence of iron deficiency anaemia is apparently rare in performance horses; despite this, iron deficiency in performance horses continues to be of concern to trainers and veterinarians. Effects of exercise on plasma ferritin concentrations were therefore studied in Standardbreds, Finnhorses and half-bred riding horses. Blood samples were taken after a moderate exercise test on a racetrack, a competition exercise test on a treadmill and a race. Even moderate exercise caused an increase in plasma ferritin concentration, with the increase being greater as the intensity and duration of exercise increased. Return to the basal level was slower after maximal-intensity exercise than after moderate exercise. In conclusion, although ferritin is a useful marker of low iron stores, samples should be taken only after at least 2 days rest following strenuous exercise.

AB  - Abstract Stem cell microenvironments are enriched by signals from a variety of components, which cooperate spatially and temporally to regulate cellular function. In vitro recapitulating such complexity in a well-controlled manner is elusive. Here, a platform for patterning multiple bio-active proteins on a single substrate is developed and optimized, and is used it to study the cooperative involvement of cell?matrix interaction and cell?cell signaling in regulating neural stem cell (NSC) function. An affinity-capturing-based multi-step microcontact printing is used to pattern, extracellular matrix proteins, and cell?cell signaling ligands, as intersecting lines on a nonadhesive background. Such design provides spatial segregation of signals from different extrinsic components, while allowing cell traffic between them during their proliferation and differentiation processes. Rat embryonic neural stem cells are cultured and characterized on the multicomponent substrates patterned with different combinations of fibronectin, N-cadherin, and Jagged1 proteins and allow to proliferate and differentiate over long term. It is found that local presentation of Notch signaling ligand (Jagged1) or cell adhesion molecule (N-cadherin) effectively modulate the balance between cell?cell and cell?matrix interaction, and significantly change the overall spatial remodeling of NSC differentiation. This platform provides an unambiguous approach to study the spatial and temporal cooperative involvement of different extrinsic components in regulating stem cell behavior. It is also readily expandable for inclusion of extra components and applicable to use with other types of cells, which provide a powerful tool for basic study of cell?material interaction or advanced tissue-interface engineering.

AB  - Summary Moxidectin has broad-spectrum anti-nematodal and anti-arthropodal activities in the horse but is not effective against tapeworms or flukes. Moxidectin and ivermectin have the same efficacy against internal, adult parasites of horses. Moxidectin, however, is highly effective in eliminating encysted and hypobiotic larval stages of cyathostomins, whereas ivermectin is not. Treatment of horses with moxidectin results in an egg-reappearance period (ERP) of 15?24 weeks. Because of its long ERP, moxidectin is labelled to be used at 12 week intervals. Moxidectin may provide protection against infection by ingested cyathostomin larvae for 2?3 weeks after it is administered. The larvicidal activity of moxidectin has often been compared to that of fenbendazole administered at either 7.5 or 10 mg/kg bwt for 5 consecutive days. The efficacy of fenbendazole, when administered daily for 5 consecutive days at 7.5 or 10 mg/kg bwt, against all stages of cyathostomins is often less than that of moxidectin because resistance of cyathostomins to benzimidazoles is prevalent worldwide, and the 5 day course of fenbendazole does not overcome this resistance. There are now reports of resistance of ascarids to moxidectin. Overt resistance of cyathostomins and a shortened egg re-emergence period after treatment with moxidectin have been reported. Rapid removal of manure by natural fauna can significantly reduce larval nematode concentrations and thereby reduce intervals of anthelmintic treatment. Of the macrocyclic lactones, moxidectin has the least deleterious effect on faecal fauna.

AB  - Early in development, GABA and glycine exert excitatory action that turns to inhibition due to modification of the chloride equilibrium potential (ECl) controlled by the KCC2 and NKCC1 transporters. This switch is thought to be due to a late expression of KCC2 associated with a NKCC1 down-regulation. Here, we show in mouse embryonic spinal cord that both KCC2 and NKCC1 are expressed and functional early in development (E11.5?E13.5) when GABAA receptor activation induces strong excitatory action. After E15.5, a switch occurs rendering GABA unable to provide excitation. At these subsequent stages, NKCC1 becomes both inactive and less abundant in motoneurons while KCC2 remains functional and hyperpolarizes ECl. In conclusion, in contrast to other systems, the cotransporters are concomitantly expressed early in the development of the mouse spinal cord. Moreover, whereas NKCC1 follows a classical functional extinction, KCC2 is highly expressed throughout both early and late embryonic life.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: West Nile virus (WNV) was first diagnosed in Saskatchewan equids in 2002. A WNV epidemic was considered highly likely for 2003, which would provide a unique opportunity to study all aspects of WNV subclinical infection and clinical disease development in a relatively naive population. Hypothesis: There are individual equid attributes and management risk factors associated with development of clinical disease. Specifically, this study could address the question of vaccine efficacy for the prevention of development of clinical disease. Methods: A case-control study was conducted in the summer of 2003 during a province-wide outbreak of WNV. Between 5 and 10 equids were sampled from each of 23 case premises with clinical disease and 23 control premises with no apparent or confirmed clinical disease. Data were analysed to identify risk factors for the development of clinical disease. Results: The proportion of equids serologically positive for natural exposure to West Nile virus was 64% (193/300). Nonvaccinated equids were 23 times (95%CI limits 3.0, 168.5, P = 0.002) more likely to develop clinical disease than those vaccinated. The estimate of vaccine efficacy in this field study was 96% (95%CI limits 67%, 99%). Conclusions: The study demonstrated that vaccination was strongly associated with the prevention of clinical disease. Potential relevance: Vaccination is an effective, practical method of prevention of clinical disease.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Wounds are one of the primary welfare concerns of working equids and are often related to harness or load-bearing packs. Objectives: To identify and quantify factors associated with the presence of pack wounds in donkeys and mules working in the wood trade in the Midelt (Northern High Atlas) region of Morocco, and to compare wounds of these donkeys and mules to those working in other trades. Methods: The study population comprised equids working in the Midelt region involved in the wood trade. Comparison populations were comprised of equids working in other trades, in the same region and in Khemmiset region (lowlands of Central Morocco). Wounds were numbered and scored according to their severity. Questionnaires were used to gather data from owners, and objective data regarding the animal, berdaa (back-pack) and load were collected. Data were analysed using multilevel uniand multivariable regression models to allow for clustering of wound sites within an equid. Results: Analysis showed an overall pack wound prevalence of 54% (n = 80/147). The most common site was the withers. Equids working in the wood trade were at increased risk of suffering pack wounds. Equids in the lowland study population were at increased risk of developing pack wounds, and donkeys were at increased risk of suffering pack wounds compared to mules both overall and within the wood trade. Other factors affecting the prevalence of wounds included the cleanliness of the berdaa and the frequency and distances of work imposed on the equid. Conclusion: Pack wounds in donkeys and mules are common in the 2 study regions of Morocco and appear to be associated with work factors including the trade the equids work in, the frequency and distances of work imposed and cleanliness of the pack. Donkeys are more susceptible than mules to developing pack wounds. Potential relevance: These results allow recommendations to be made to owners of equids that may decrease the prevalence of wounds and, therefore, improve welfare and working capability of these equids. Research is required to identify reasons for regional difference in prevalence of pack wounds in equids not working in the wood trade.

AB  - Summary This case report provides a clinical description of an epithelioid variant of haemangiosarcoma in a horse. Haemangiosarcomas are rare neoplasms in equids, and only recently have the pathological aspects of the epithelioid variant in horses been described. Despite performance of cytology and surgical biopsy, the ante mortem diagnosis was incorrect in this case, demonstrating the common problem with diagnosing this neoplasm due to the lack of overt vascular differentiation. Due to the deteriorating condition of the patient, no antineoplastic treatment was attempted. A post mortem computed tomography helped characterise the invasive nature of the tumour. Only with post mortem sampling was the diagnosis of epithelioid variant of haemangiosarcoma discovered.

AB  - Abstract Background In industrialised countries injuries (including burns, poisoning or drowning) are the leading cause of childhood death and steep social gradients exist in child injury mortality and morbidity. The majority of injuries in pre-school children occur at home but there is little meta-analytic evidence that child home safety interventions reduce injury rates or improve a range of safety practices, and little evidence on their effect by social group. Objectives We evaluated the effectiveness of home safety education, with or without the provision of low cost, discounted or free equipment (hereafter referred to as home safety interventions), in reducing child injury rates or increasing home safety practices and whether the effect varied by social group. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2009, Issue 2) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED), ISI Web of Science: Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index- Science (CPCI-S), CINAHL (EBSCO) and DARE (2009, Issue 2) in The Cochrane Library. We also searched websites and conference proceedings and searched the bibliographies of relevant studies and previously published reviews. We contacted authors of included studies as well as relevant organisations. The most recent search for trials was May 2009. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised controlled trials and controlled before and after (CBA) studies where home safety education with or without the provision of safety equipment was provided to those aged 19 years and under, and which reported injury, safety practices or possession of safety equipment. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. We attempted to obtain individual participant level data (IPD) for all included studies and summary data and IPD were simultaneously combined in meta-regressions by social and demographic variables. Pooled incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated for injuries which occurred during the studies, and pooled odds ratios were calculated for the uptake of safety equipment or safety practices, with 95% confidence intervals. Main results Ninety-eight studies, involving 2,605,044 people, are included in this review. Fifty-four studies involving 812,705 people were comparable enough to be included in at least one meta-analysis. Thirty-five (65%) studies were RCTs. Nineteen (35%) of the studies included in the meta-analysis provided IPD. There was a lack of evidence that home safety interventions reduced rates of thermal injuries or poisoning. There was some evidence that interventions may reduce injury rates after adjusting CBA studies for baseline injury rates (IRR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01). Greater reductions in injury rates were found for interventions delivered in the home (IRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.91), and for those interventions not providing safety equipment (IRR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.92). Home safety interventions were effective in increasing the proportion of families with safe hot tap water temperatures (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.86), functional smoke alarms (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.52), a fire escape plan (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.77), storing medicines (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.84) and cleaning products (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.96) out of reach, having syrup of ipecac (OR 3.34, 95% CI 1.50 to 7.44) or poison control centre numbers accessible (OR 3.30, 95% CI 1.70 to 6.39), having fitted stair gates (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.17), and having socket covers on unused sockets (OR 2.69, 95% CI 1.46 to 4.96). Interventions providing free, low cost or discounted safety equipment appeared to be more effective in improving some safety practices than those interventions not doing so. There was no consistent evidence that interventions were less effective in families whose children were at greater risk of injury. Authors' conclusions Home safety interventions most commonly provided as one-to-one, face-to-face education, especially with the provision of safety equipment, are effective in increasing a range of safety practices. There is some evidence that such interventions may reduce injury rates, particularly where interventions are provided at home. Conflicting findings regarding interventions providing safety equipment on safety practices and injury outcomes are likely to be explained by two large studies; one clinic-based study provided equipment but did not reduce injury rates and one school-based study did not provide equipment but did demonstrate a significant reduction in injury rates. There was no consistent evidence that home safety education, with or without the provision of safety equipment, was less effective in those participants at greater risk of injury. Further studies are still required to confirm these findings with respect to injury rates. Plain Language Summary Home safety education and providing safety equipment for injury prevention Injuries are the leading cause of childhood death in industrialised countries. People living in disadvantaged circumstances are at greater risk of injury than those who are more advantaged. This review examined whether home safety education and providing safety equipment reduced injuries and increased safety behaviours and safety equipment use. It also looked at whether home safety education was more or less effective in disadvantaged families. The review authors found 98 studies involving 2,605,044 participants which reported many different safety behaviours, but relatively few studies included information on injuries. The authors found that home safety interventions provided in the home may reduce injury rates, but more research is needed to confirm this finding. The results often varied between studies but, overall, families who received home safety interventions were more likely to have a safe hot tap water temperature, a working smoke alarm, a fire escape plan, fitted stair gates, socket covers on unused sockets, syrup of ipecac, poison control centre numbers accessible, and to store medicines and cleaning products out of reach of children. The authors found that home safety education was equally effective in the families whose children were at greater risk of injury.

AB  - Summary Narcotic analgesics produce pharmacological effects by interacting with specific opiate receptors. At least five major types of opiate receptors have been recognised. These include ? (morphine) and kappa (ethylketazocine) receptor types. Narcotic analgesics which interact with ? receptors produce locomotor and autonomic stimulation at doses that produce little or no analgesia. Therefore, use of these drugs as analgesics in equine medicine has not been very satisfactory. Theoretical considerations suggested that the role of kappa agonists in equine analgesia be investigated. Using a pure kappa agonist, U-50. 488H, good analgesia was produced in the horse with little or no locomotor stimulation or autonomic effects. These data suggest that kappa agonists may be superior analgesics for clinical use in the horse. On the other hand, the locomotor stimulant effects of ? agonist analgesics enable their use as illegal medications. Specifically, these agents produce a good running response, signs of central nervous stimulation and analgesia, all potentially useful effects in a racehorse. Regulatory control of most narcotic analgesics can be obtained by high performance thin layer chromatographic screening. However, effective screening for the fentanyls and small doses of etorphine can only be achieved by use of immunoassay.

AB  - Summary Lamb losses to hypothermia are highest outdoors in wet, cold and windy environments but can also occur indoors, in particular in lambs that are compromised due to dystocia. The 20% glucose solution used for intraperitoneal injection should be warmed to body temperature. Lambs which are unable to suck from a teat should be fed using a stomach tube and feeder. Watery mouth is a common disease of oneto three-day-old lambs seen under all management systems. Lamb dysentery is a sudden onset fatal clostridial disease of young lambs. Outbreaks of salmonellosis in lambs are rare, and usually follow the purchase of infected carrier sheep or calves. Most cases are caused by Salmonella typhimurium or Salmonella Dublin. Rotavirus and coronavirus infections do not appear to cause primary disease in lambs, although lambs may be infected during the first week of life. Iodine deficiency is an occasional cause of high mortality rates in newborn lambs and kids.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the hand hygiene (HH) practices among veterinary technicians (VT) and veterinary support staff (VSS) in small animal private practice. Methods: This was a prospective questionnaire-based study involving 182 VT and VSS from 18 small animal hospitals in the USA. Questions asked included gender, number of animals handled per work shift, frequency of hand washing, reason for not washing more frequently, most common available hand washing agent, education regarding the importance of HH and frequency of ring wearing. Results: Less than half of the respondents [76 of 182 (41·7%)] reported washing their hands regularly between handling patients and 154 of 182 (85·6%) believed they should have washed more frequently. The most commonly employed HH agent was hand soap [154 of 182 (84·6%)] and the most common reason cited for not washing more frequently was being too busy [132 of 182 (72·5%)]. Only 96 of 182 (52·7%) respondents were educated by doctors at their hospital regarding the importance of HH. Clinical Significance: The HH practices among VT and VSS in small animal private practice is poor. Hand soap was the most commonly employed agent among respondents in this study. Education of VT and VSS regarding the importance of HH requires improvement.

AB  - ABSTRACT Novel lipid raft stationary phase chromatography (LRSC), with lipid rafts that contain abundant tropomyosin-related tyrosine kinase A receptors immobilized on the stationary phase, was developed for a high-throughput screening of potentially active antitumor agents. Lestaurtinib was used as a model compound to determine the operational parameters of the LRSC. Of all the factors considered, the particle size of column packing, the column temperature and the flow rate were of immense importance in determining the performance of the established LRSC system. In order to profoundly comprehend the binding interaction between the model drug and the receptors on the column, thermodynamic studies were employed. The results revealed that the interaction was spontaneous and exothermic, a typical enthalpy-driven process. Additionally, the primary forces were hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces. In evaluating the applicability of the method, active extracts from Albizziae Cortex were screened out using the LRSC system under the optimized conditions. The bioactive components were successfully confirmed by the MTT assay. In conclusion, it could be said that the LRSC is a good model for screening potential antitumor agents because of its viability, rapid response and scalable features.

AB  - New findings ?? What is the topic of this review? This review discusses the regulation of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene and how it is uniquely set up to respond to stress signals in skeletal muscle. We propose that skeletal muscle is a ?stress sensor? that responds by releasing highly active endocrine and paracrine proteins, such as IL-6. ?? What advances does this highlight? Recent discoveries on the regulation of the IL-6 gene in various stress exposures have resulted in the emergence of a new potential role for skeletal muscle in life-threatening stress conditions. Understanding the relationship between IL-6 secretion and stress may provide new insights into normal adaptive responses to disease, deconditioning, inflammation and ageing. Skeletal muscle has been identified as an endocrine organ owing to its capacity to produce and secrete a variety of cytokines (myokines) and other proteins. To date, myokines have primarily been studied in response to exercise or metabolic challenges; however, numerous observations suggest that skeletal muscle may also release myokines in response to certain categories of internal or external stress exposure. Internal stress signals include oxidative or nitrosative stress, damaged or unfolded proteins, hyperthermia or energy imbalance. External stress signals, which act as indicators of organismal stress or injury in other cells, employ mediators such as catecholamines, endotoxin, alarmins, ATP and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1?. External stress signals generally induce cellular responses through membrane receptor systems. In this review, we focus on the regulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a prototypical stress response myokine and highlight evidence that IL-6 gene regulation in muscle is inherently organized to respond to a wide variety of internal and external stressors. Given that IL-6 can initiate protective, anti-inflammatory or restorative processes throughout the organism during life-threatening conditions, we present the argument that skeletal muscle has a physiological function as a sensor and responder to stress. Furthermore, we hypothesize that it may comprise a fundamental component of the organism's acute stress response.

AB  - Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine simple prognostic criteria for differentiation of canine solitary lung tumour cases into those that will and will not benefit from thoracic surgery. Methods: This was a retrospective study using the records of cases presented to Davies Veterinary Specialists, Hitchin, UK, from December 1998 to December 2005. Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier and logrank methods. Potentially significant variables were evaluated by multivariate Cox analysis. Results: Forty-two patients met the inclusion criteria. Primary tumour stage T1, absence of neoplastic lymph nodes and metastases, and papillary tumour type were statistically significant favourable prognostic indicators on univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis attributed significance to primary tumour stage T1 and papillary type only. Median survival times were 555 days for T1N0M0 tumours of papillary type and 72 days for the remainder. Clinical Significance: Survival time following surgery in dogs with primary lung tumours was poor except in clinical stage T1N0M0 cases. These data support use of clinical techniques to dichotomise cases as T1N0M0 or other, improving decision making in thoracic surgery. These data validate initiation of prospective studies examining the role of chemotherapy in the management of advanced cases.
