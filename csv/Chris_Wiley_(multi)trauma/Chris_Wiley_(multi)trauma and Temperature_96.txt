AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Desmopathies of the suspensory ligament are relatively frequent and vary in prevalence over different anatomical regions. This variation may be because of regional differences in tissue characteristics. Objective: To characterise different regions of healthy forelimb suspensory ligaments (SLs) by means of biochemical, biomechanical and histomorphological techniques. Hypothesis: There is substantial topographical heterogeneity in the SL with respect to structural, compositional and functional characteristics. Methods: SLs were harvested from 38 limbs and used for biochemical (n = 20), biomechanical (n = 14) and histomorphological (n = 4) evaluation. Sulphated glycosaminoglycan (S-GAG), DNA and collagen content, degree of lysyl hydroxylation and numbers of enzymatic and nonenzymatic cross-links were determined in 7 regions of the SL: lateral and medial part of the origin (OM, OL), mid-body (MB), axial and abaxial parts of the lateral and medial branches (ILAX, ILAB, IMAX and IMAB, respectively). Passive resistance to tensile loading was measured in 5 regions of the SL (all except OL and OM). Results: DNA content was lower in OL and OM than in all other parts. GAG content was also lower in OL and OM and highest in ILAB and IMAB. Collagen content was lower in OL/OM and highest in ILAX/IMAX. Pentosidine levels were highest in OL and significantly lower in the lateral insertion (ILAX/ILAB). There were no differences in hydroxylysylpyridinoline (HP) cross-links or lysyl hydroxylation. Stiffness (P<0.01) and modulus of elasticity (P<0.01) were substantially higher in the MB region than in all other regions except for IMAB. Strain at failure was lower in the MB region (P<0.0001), resulting in a comparable force at rupture as in the other regions. Conclusions: Matrix composition differs to a relatively limited extent between different regions of the SL. The mid-body of the ligament is stiffer than the branches, which have similar properties and relevance and mechanical differences between mid-body and branches/origin may explain some use-related differences in the prevalence of lesions.

AB  - Abstract A current clinical challenge is to replace autografts for repair of injury gaps in peripheral nerves, which can occur due to trauma or surgical interruption. Biodegradable metallic magnesium filaments, placed inside hollow nerve conduits, could support nerve repair by providing contact guidance support for axonal regeneration. This was tested by repairing sciatic nerves of adult rats with single magnesium filaments placed inside poly(caprolactone) nerve conduits. Controls were empty conduits, conduits containing titanium filaments and/or isografts from donor rats. With a nerve gap of 6 mm and 6 weeks post-repair, magnesium filaments had partially resorbed. Regenerating cells had attached to the filaments and axons were observed in distal stumps in all animals. Axon parameters were improved with magnesium compared to conduits alone or conduits with single titanium filaments. With a longer gap of 15 mm and 16 weeks post-repair, functional parameters were improved with isografts, but not with magnesium filaments or empty conduits. Magnesium filaments were completely resorbed and no evidence of scarring was seen. While axon outgrowth was not improved with the longer gap, histological measures of the tissues were improved with magnesium compared to empty conduits. Therefore, the use of magnesium filaments is promising because they are biocompatible and improve aspects of nerve regeneration. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Background Medetomidine suppresses cardiovascular function and reduces gastrointestinal motility in horses mainly through peripheral α2-adrenoceptors. Vatinoxan, a peripheral α2-antagonist, has been shown experimentally to alleviate the adverse effects of some α2-agonists in horses. However, vatinoxan has not been investigated during constant-rate infusion (CRI) of medetomidine in standing horses. Objectives To evaluate effects of vatinoxan on cardiovascular function, gastrointestinal motility and on sedation level during CRI of medetomidine. Study design Experimental, randomised, blinded, cross-over study. Methods Six healthy horses were given medetomidine hydrochloride, 7 ?g/kg i.v., without (MED) and with (MED+V) vatinoxan hydrochloride, 140 ?g/kg i.v., followed by CRI of medetomidine at 3.5 ?g/kg/h for 60 min. Cardiorespiratory variables were recorded and borborygmi and sedation levels were scored for 120 min. Plasma drug concentrations were measured. The data were analysed using repeated measures ANCOVA and paired t-tests as appropriate. Results Initially heart rate (HR) was significantly lower and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) significantly higher with MED compared with MED+V. For example at 10 min HR (mean ± s.d.) was 26 ± 2 and 31 ± 5 beats/minute (P = 0.04) and MAP 129 ± 15 and 103 ± 13 mmHg (P<0.001) respectively. At 10 min, cardiac index was lower (P = 0.02) and systemic vascular resistance higher (P = 0.001) with MED than with MED+V. Borborygmi were reduced after MED; this effect was attenuated by vatinoxan (P<0.001). All horses were sedated with medetomidine, but the mean sedation scores were reduced with MED+V until 20 min (6.8 ± 0.8 and 4.5 ± 1.5 with MED and MED+V, respectively, at 10 min, P = 0.001). Plasma concentration of dexmedetomidine was significantly lower in the presence of vatinoxan (P = 0.01). Main limitations Experimental study with healthy, unstimulated animals. Conclusions Vatinoxan administered i.v. with a loading dose of medetomidine improved cardiovascular function and gastrointestinal motility during medetomidine CRI in healthy horses. Sedation was slightly yet significantly reduced during the first 20 min.. The Summary is available in Portuguese ? see Supporting Information

AB  - Abstract This work was performed as part of a multi-year study to determine the cause of the low fertility in captive rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) and attempt to increase the fertility through artificial insemination (AI). Semen collection and characterization was performed on 14 male rockhopper penguins. The samples were evaluated for volume, sperm concentration, and sperm quality (motility, forward motility, viability, and morphology). There was a large variation between individuals and between collections for each individual. Mean volume of ejaculate was 0.24?ml. Mean concentration was 47.09 ? 106?sperm/ml. Mean number of sperm per collection was 6.57? 106. The mean motility was 49.4%. Mean forward motility was 1.7. Mean percentage of living sperm was 88.9%. Mean percentage of sperm with normal morphology was 69.4%. AI was performed on a total of 10 females using pooled semen samples. The birds were also allowed to naturally mate. Ten eggs were laid and three fertile eggs were produced, one of them hatched but died within 24?hr. Paternity testing was performed using 12 microsatellite loci, but unfortunately due to insufficient variability, the paternity of the chick and two embryos could not be determined.

AB  - Objectives To present a novel technique for loading of the canine elbow joint and to quantify changes in congruency with increasing load using computed tomography. Materials and Methods Five pairs of thoracic limbs were mounted at a mid stance angle in a custom made jig. Elbow joints were loaded to 0, 33, 66 and 100% of total individual cadaver bodyweight. At each load computed tomography of the elbow was performed. Joint space measurement was performed on sagittal plane central, lateral and medial compartment images at humero-radial (R1,?R2,?R3), humero-ulnar (U1, U2) and radio-ulnar loci. The effect of loading on joint spaces was assessed (P<0·05). Results With increasing load; for central an increase in R1 and radio-ulnar distance and decreased R3?occurred; for medial R1 increased; and for lateral R1 and radio-ulnar distance increased. The largest increases were seen in the lateral compartment. Clinical Significance Significant changes in humero-radio-ulnar congruency occurred suggesting pronation of the radius with respect to the ulna was induced during loading. This movement may influence the load experienced by the medial coronoid process and could play a role in the aetiopathogenesis of medial coronoid process disease.

AB  - Summary Background While cobalt is an essential micronutrient for vitamin B12 synthesis in the horse, at supraphysiological concentrations, it has been shown to enhance performance in human subjects and rats, and there is evidence that its administration in high doses to horses poses a welfare threat. Animal sport regulators currently control cobalt abuse via international race day thresholds, but this work was initiated to explore means of potentially adding to application of those thresholds since cobalt may be present in physiological concentrations. Objectives To devise a scientific basis for differentiation between presence of cobalt from bona fide supplementation and cobalt doping through the use of ratios. Study design Six Thoroughbred horses were given 10 mL vitamin B12/cobalt supplement (Hemo-15?; Vetoquinol, Buckingham, Buckinghamshire, UK., 1.5 mg B12, 7 mg cobalt gluconate = 983 ?g total Co) as an i.v. bolus then an i.v. infusion (15 min) of 100 mg cobalt chloride (45.39 mg Co) 6 weeks later. Pre-and post-administration plasma and urine samples were analysed for cobalt and vitamin B12. Methods Urine and plasma samples were analysed for vitamin B12 using an immunoassay and cobalt concentrations were measured via ICP-MS. Baseline concentrations of cobalt in urine and plasma for each horse were subtracted from their cobalt concentrations post-administration for the PK analysis. Compartmental analysis was used for the determination of plasma PK parameters for cobalt using commercially available software. Results On administration of a vitamin B12/cobalt supplement, the ratio of cobalt to vitamin B12 in plasma rapidly increased to approximately 3 and then rapidly declined below a ratio of 1 and then back to near baseline over the next week. On administration of 100 mg cobalt chloride, the ratio initially exceeded 10 in plasma and then declined with the lower 95% confidence interval remaining above a ratio of 1 for 7 days. For two horses with extended sampling, the plasma ratio remained above one for approximately 28 days after cobalt chloride administration. The effect of the administration of the vitamin B12/cobalt supplement on the urine ratio was transient and reached a peak value of 10 which then rapidly declined. However, a urine ratio of 10 was exceeded, with the lower 95% confidence interval remaining above a ratio of 10 for 7 days after cobalt chloride administration. For the two horses with extended sampling, the urine ratio remained above 10 for about 18 days (442 h) after cobalt chloride administration even though the absolute cobalt urine concentration had dropped below the international threshold of 100 ng/mL after 96 h. Main limitations Only one vitamin B12/cobalt product was evaluated, a limited number of horses were included, the horses were not in full race training and the results may be specific to this population of horses. Conclusions The results provide the basis for a potential strategy for allowing supplementation with vitamin B12 products, while controlling the misuse of high doses of cobalt, through a combination of international thresholds and ratios of cobalt to vitamin B12, in plasma and urine.

AB  - Abstract. Glucagon injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly may take up to 30 min to reverse hypogly-caemia. We investigated whether glucagon absorption could be accelerated by two manoeuvres known to enhance insulin absorption: addition of a powerful local hyperaemic agent (10 nmole α-calcitonin gene-related peptide; CGRP), and injection using a multi-hole ?sprinkler? needle. Glucagon (1 mg) given by conventional injection to six normal subjects produced peak plasma glucagon concentrations of 1?48 ± 0.23 (SEM) ng ml-1 after 20 min and a peak glycaemic response of 7.8 ± 0.8 mmol 1-1 at 25 min. Glucagon injected with CGRP or using the sprinkler needle did not produce any significant differences in plasma glucagon or glycaemia profiles, compared with conventional injection. Further studies demonstrated that glucagon is itself a powerful vasodilator, causing a 300?500% increase in local blood flow, comparable to that induced by CGRP. Because of its intense local hyperaemic action, the absorption of subcutaneously-injected glucagon may be optimal and seems unlikely to be accelerated by pharmacological or other means.

AB  - Objectives: To describe therapeutic antibiotic use patterns in dogs at a small animal teaching hospital. Methods: A retrospective case analysis of randomly sampled antibiotic prescriptions in dogs from May 20, 2008 to May 20, 2009, deemed to be for therapeutic use, was performed. Records were reviewed to determine if there was documentation of confirmed, suspected or no evidence of infection. The five most frequently prescribed antibiotics were identified and analysed for their distribution in these categories. Results: In 17% of therapeutic antibiotic prescriptions there was confirmed infection, in 45% suspected infection, and in 38% there was no documented evidence of infection. Amoxicillin-clavulanate was the most frequently prescribed antibiotic, followed by cefazolin/cephalexin, enrofloxacin, ampicillin/amoxicillin and doxycycline. Doxycycline was the most frequently prescribed with no documented evidence of infection, and amoxicillin-clavulanate was the most frequently prescribed with either confirmed or suspected evidence of infection. Discussion: Clinicians use a variety of tools when deciding whether or not to prescribe an antibiotic and which antibiotic to use. As in human medicine, there is likely overuse and inappropriate use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine. Veterinarians should engage in discussions regarding clinically applicable guidelines for appropriate antibiotic use.

AB  - Assessment of dental pulp status is normally undertaken using thermal or electrical tests that indicate the functioning of Aδ nerve fibers. The tests are quick and usually reliable, although nothing is absolute. Newer tests have involved assessment of blood flow, and of these laser Doppler flowmetry has been the most widely used and beneficial to patients particularly after traumatic injury. The high cost of flowmeters and the time-consuming procedure have limited uptake.

AB  - Summary Ventilation-perfusion relationships were studied by the multiple inert gas elimination technique in seven horses while they were conscious and during inhalation anaesthesia with halothane. A generally good match between ventilation and perfusion was found in the conscious, standing horse. During anaesthesia a huge shunt developed, ie perfusion of completely unventilated lung regions, both in dorsal and left lateral recumbency and whether the horse was breathing spontaneously or mechanically ventilated. The shunt was significantly greater and the arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) significantly lower in dorsal than in left lateral recumbency. Little or no perfusion of low V?A/Q? regions was observed during anaesthesia, whether ventilation was spontaneous or mechanical. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) did not significantly improve PaO2 or reduce the shunt. Selective mechanical ventilation of dependent lung regions with PEEP reduced the shunt markedly, an effect that was not achieved by conventional mechanical ventilation with general PEEP. The findings seem compatible with alveolar collapse during anaesthesia, causing shunt, whereas the absence of clearly low V?A/Q? regions questions the role of airway closure as the major disturbance of gas exchange.

AB  - Summary This report describes two cases of successful surgical management of granulosa cell tumours (GCT) in mares presenting with haemoperitoneum (HP). Controlled abdominal drainage was initially attempted in Case 1 but was not successful. A ventral midline exploratory laparotomy allowed removal of a haemorrhaging 13 kg GCT. The mare made a full recovery and returned to normal work as a driving pony 11 months post-operatively. In Case 2 controlled abdominal drainage was followed by standing left flank laparoscopic visualisation of the bleeding ovary and transection of the ovarian pedicle by electrocautery. The GCT was then removed via a ventral midline incision due to its large size. Haemoperitoneum can be associated with GCTs and in some cases is severe enough to prompt emergency treatment. Stabilisation of the patient and removal of the haemorrhaging GCT can lead to a successful outcome.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing the study Distal deep digital flexor tendinopathy is an important cause of foot lameness in horses that is difficult to diagnose with radiography and ultrasonography. Magnetic resonance imaging is a well-accepted and validated technique for the identification of deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) lesions, but has some practical and financial drawbacks. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) has been proposed as a suitable alternative, but validation studies are currently lacking. Objective To assess the accuracy of CECT for the identification and characterisation of deep digital flexor tendinopathy. Study design Descriptive study of CT, macroscopic and histological findings of the DDFT. Methods Plain and CECT scans were acquired of 23 limbs of 16 horses with clinical lameness localised to the foot. All horses had lesions of the DDFT that were identified and characterised with CT and CECT with respect to their anatomic location and extent. All horses underwent post mortem examination and gross abnormalities were described. Samples of the DDFT were taken at specific sites (lesion and nonlesion) for histological evaluation. Macroscopic and histological outcomes were compared with CECT findings. Results Of 67 sites in 23 DDFTs that were evaluated, 42 sites in 18 tendons had lesions on CECT images. These 42 sites also had lesions on macroscopic evaluation. There were 3 false negative and 3 false positive results identified on CECT. The sensitivity of CECT for diagnosing lesions of the DDFT in the equine foot was 93%. Conclusion CECT is an effective adjunct to the more commonly used diagnostic techniques in equine foot pain.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study Joint inflammation and septic arthritis are both potential complications of intra-articular injections of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). Clinicians may prophylactically co-inject BM-MSCs admixed with either antimicrobials or hyaluronic acid; however, the effect of these agents on cultured BM-MSCs is unknown. Objective To determine the effects of therapeutic levels of gentamicin, amikacin and hyaluronic acid on cultured equine BM-MSCs in vitro. Study design In vitro experimental study. Methods Equine BM-MSCs from 4 healthy mature horses were isolated. Cultured BM-MSCs from each donor were incubated with gentamicin (150?mg), amikacin (250?mg), hyaluronic acid (22?mg) or 1% penicillin/streptomycin (control) under sterile conditions. Mesenchymal stem cells viability, proliferation, mediator secretion and culture media pH were measured. Results Incubation of BM-MSCs with gentamicin resulted in >95% MSC death after 45?min, and incubation of BM-MSCs with amikacin resulted in >95% MSC death after 2?h. Incubation of BM-MSCs with hyaluronic acid or penicillin/streptomycin (control) for up to 6?h resulted in sustained BM-MSC viability of 80% and >93%, respectively. All additives resulted in decreased media pH in the first minute; however, the pH then remained constant over the 6 h incubation period. No significant differences in BM-MSC proliferation or mediator secretion between the penicillin/streptomycin (control) and cells treated with hyaluronic acid were observed. Conclusion Therapeutic concentrations of aminoglycoside antimicrobials are toxic to cultured equine BM-MSCs. The effects of hyaluronic acid on cultured MSC viability, proliferation and mediator secretion are minimal. Potential relevance Based on these findings, the mixing of aminoglycoside antimicrobials and cultured equine BM-MSCs prior to therapeutic use is not recommended.

AB  - Metabolic heat produced by Thoroughbred racehorses during racing can rapidly elevate core body temperature (1°C/min). When environmental conditions are hot and humid, the normal physiological cooling mechanisms become ineffective. The heat accumulated may exceed a critical thermal maximum (estimated to be 42°C), which may trigger a complex pathophysiological cascade with potentially lethal consequences. This syndrome has been labelled exertional heat illness (EHI). EHI is described in humans, but has not been well documented in Thoroughbred racehorses. The clinical signs described in racehorses would suggest that the pathophysiological events affecting the central nervous (CNS) and gastrointestinal systems are similar to those described in humans. Clinical signs are progressive and include signs of endotoxaemia and increasing levels of CNS dysfunction. Initially, horses that may be mildly irritable (agitated, randomly kicking out) may progress to unmanageable (disorientation, severe ataxia, falling) and ultimately convulsions, coma and death. Currently, the approach to treatment is largely empirical and involves rapid and effective cooling, administration of drugs to provide sedation, administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to ameliorate the effects of endotoxaemia and glucocorticoids to stabilise cell membranes and reduce the effects of inflammation on the CNS. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge about EHI in Thoroughbred racehorses, suggests a likely pathophysiology of the syndrome in horses based on the current literature on heat illness in humans and horses, and outlines current treatment strategies being used to treat racehorses with clinical signs of EHI.

AB  - Objective Determine the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) on platelet function and thromboxane synthesis immediately after drug administration and following 5 days of NSAID administration in healthy horses. Study Design Randomized cross-over study. Animals Healthy adult horses (n=9; 6 geldings and 3 mares). Methods Horses received either flunixin meglumine (1.1 mg/kg IV every 12 hours), phenylbutazone (2.2 mg/kg IV every 12 hours), or firocoxib (loading dose of 0.27 mg/kg IV on day 1, then 0.09 mg/kg IV every 24 hours for 4 days) for a total of 5 days. Blood samples were collected prior to drug administration (day 0), 1 hour after initial NSAID administration (day 1), and then 1 hour post-NSAID administration on day 5. Platelet function was assessed using turbidimetric aggregometry and a platelet function analyzer. Serum thromboxane B2 concentrations were determined by commercial ELISA kit. A minimum 14 day washout period occurred between trials. Results At 1 hour and 5 days postadministration of firocoxib, flunixin meglumine, or phenylbutazone, there was no significant effect on platelet aggregation or function using turbidimetric aggregometry or a platelet function analyzer. There was, however, a significant decrease in thromboxane synthesis at 1 hour and 5 days postadministration of flunixin meglumine and phenylbutazone that was not seen with firocoxib. Conclusion Preoperative administration of flunixin meglumine, phenylbutazone, or firocoxib should not inhibit platelet function based on our model. The clinical implications of decreased thromboxane B2 synthesis following flunixin meglumine and phenylbutazone administration are undetermined.

AB  - Summary A 2-day-old filly foal presented with signs of depression, recumbency and inappetence. Blood analyses revealed hypoalbuminaemia, hyperfibrinogenaemia, hyperglycaemia and hyperkalaemia. The foal deteriorated despite intensive treatment and was subjected to euthanasia. At post mortem examination, the urinary bladder, ureters and kidneys appeared normal grossly. Histologically both kidneys showed disorganised development with the presence of structures inappropriate for a foal of this age, including primitive glomeruli, immature renal tubules and persistent metanephric ducts. Based on these findings a diagnosis of bilateral renal dysplasia was made.

AB  - Summary Warmth, hydration, and energy are critical during initial care. Once infants are at normal body temperature, weigh them (in grams if small, in tenths of a gram if tiny) and administer warm fluids to correct hydration deficits. Once the infant is warmed and well hydrated, species-appropriate diets may be fed. This chapter provides general information on housing, diet, and rearing of birds. Infant wildlife often present with external and/or internal parasites. In wildlife shelter nurseries, it is common to have antiparasitic protocols for infants administered on a herd health basis because individual diagnostics and treatment plans are often not feasible. Rapid social development of each animal and workload of personnel often preclude isolation of individuals until each animal tests negative for parasites. Metabolic bone disease develops quickly in wild orphans fed inadequate diets, as fast as a few days in rapidly growing species, and this is usually due to inadequate calcium in the diet.

AB  - Abstract Aims? To investigate vibrotactile sense (large fibre neuropathy) at different frequencies in index and little fingers (median and ulnar nerves, respectively) of subjects with diabetes, or impaired (IGT) or normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Methods? Vibration thresholds (tactilometry at seven frequencies (8, 16, 32, 64, 125, 250 and 500 Hz)) and median nerve function (electrophysiology) were examined in men (age 73.4 ± 0.12 years; n = 58, mean ± sd) with persistent NGT (n = 28) or IGT (n = 7) or with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (n = 23) for > 15 years. Results? HbA1c was increased and vibrotactile sense (sensibility index) was impaired in index and little fingers in men with T2DM. Vibration thresholds were particularly increased at 16, 250 and 500 Hz in the little finger (ulnar nerve). T2DM subjects showed electrophysiological (gold standard) signs of neuropathy in the median nerve. Although subjects with persistent IGT had higher HbA1c, vibrotactile sensation and electrophysiology remained normal. HbA1c did not correlate with vibrotactile sense or electrophysiology, but the latter two correlated with respect to Z-score (sign of neuropathy) in forearm (NGT) and at wrist level (NGT and DM). Conclusions? Vibration thresholds are increased in the finger pulps in T2DM subjects, particularly at specific frequencies in ulnar nerve innervated finger pulps. Neuropathy is not present in IGT. Tactilometry, with a multi-frequency approach, is a sensitive technique to screen for large fibre neuropathy in T2DM. Frequency-related changes may mirror dysfunction of various receptors.
