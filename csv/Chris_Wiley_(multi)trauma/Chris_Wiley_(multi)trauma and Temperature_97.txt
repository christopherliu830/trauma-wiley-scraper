AB  - Abstract In the current study, we describe the synthesis, material characteristics, and cytocompatibility of conducting poly (?-caprolactone) (PCL)-based nano-composite films. Electrically conducting carbon nano-fillers (carbon nano-fiber (CNF), nano-graphite (NG), and liquid exfoliated graphite (G)) were used to prepare porous film type scaffolds using modified solvent casting methods. The electrical conductivity of the nano-composite films was increased when carbon nano-fillers were incorporated in the PCL matrix. CNF-based nano-composite films showed the highest increase in electrical conductivity. The presence of an ionic solution significantly improved the conductivity of some of the polymers, however at least 24 h was required to absorb the simulated ion solutions. CNF-based nano-composite films were found to have good thermo-mechanical properties compared to other conducting polymer films due to better dispersion and alignment in the critical direction. Increased nano-filler content increased the crystallisation temperature. Analysis of cell viability revealed no increase in cell death on any of the polymers compared to tissue culture plastic controls, or compared to PCL polymer without nano-composites. The scaffolds showed some variation when tested for PC12 cell attachment and proliferation, however all the polymers supported PC12 attachment and differentiation in the absence of cell adhesion molecules. In general, CNF-based nano-composite films with highest electrical conductivity and moderate roughness showed highest cell attachment and proliferation. These polymers are promising candidates for use in neural applications in the area of bionics and tissue engineering due to their unique properties. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Aims? To investigate vibrotactile sense (large fibre neuropathy) at different frequencies in index and little fingers (median and ulnar nerves, respectively) of subjects with diabetes, or impaired (IGT) or normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Methods? Vibration thresholds (tactilometry at seven frequencies (8, 16, 32, 64, 125, 250 and 500 Hz)) and median nerve function (electrophysiology) were examined in men (age 73.4 ± 0.12 years; n = 58, mean ± sd) with persistent NGT (n = 28) or IGT (n = 7) or with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (n = 23) for > 15 years. Results? HbA1c was increased and vibrotactile sense (sensibility index) was impaired in index and little fingers in men with T2DM. Vibration thresholds were particularly increased at 16, 250 and 500 Hz in the little finger (ulnar nerve). T2DM subjects showed electrophysiological (gold standard) signs of neuropathy in the median nerve. Although subjects with persistent IGT had higher HbA1c, vibrotactile sensation and electrophysiology remained normal. HbA1c did not correlate with vibrotactile sense or electrophysiology, but the latter two correlated with respect to Z-score (sign of neuropathy) in forearm (NGT) and at wrist level (NGT and DM). Conclusions? Vibration thresholds are increased in the finger pulps in T2DM subjects, particularly at specific frequencies in ulnar nerve innervated finger pulps. Neuropathy is not present in IGT. Tactilometry, with a multi-frequency approach, is a sensitive technique to screen for large fibre neuropathy in T2DM. Frequency-related changes may mirror dysfunction of various receptors.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: The post operative response of the large colon wall after a surgically corrected large colon volvulus (LCV) has not been investigated. Objectives: To use transabdominal ultrasound to monitor the post operative change in large colon wall thickness following surgical correction of LCV. Hypothesis: A prolonged period to colon wall involution is correlated with an increased rate of post operative morbidity and mortality. Methods: A prospective clinical study including horses that presented to the North Carolina State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital for colic between September 2006 and March, 2008, had surgically diagnosed and corrected LCV (at least 360°) without resection and recovered from anaesthesia. Ultrasound of the ventral large colon was performed at the time of anaesthetic recovery and every 6?8?h until the colon wall returned to normal thickness (≤5?mm). Outcome was evaluated using a one-way ANOVA to compare average time to colon wall involution between: 1) survivors and nonsurvivors; and 2) horses that developed multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) during the post operative period and those that recovered without evidence of MODS. Results: Sixteen horses that recovered without evidence of MODS had a significantly shorter period to colon wall involution (≤5?mm) compared to those diagnosed with MODS (mean ± s.e. 19.6?h ± 2.5 and 39.7?h ± 6.7 respectively, P = 0.006). There was no significant difference in mean period to colon wall involution between survivors and nonsurvivors (26.2 ± 4.9 and 33.2 ± 7.8?h, respectively). Conclusions: A shorter time to colon wall involution was associated with decreased post operative morbidity in horses presented for surgical correction of large colon volvulus without resection. Potential relevance: Ultrasonographic monitoring of colon wall involution after surgical correction of LCV may aid in identifying those cases at risk of MODS. Further investigation of colon wall involution time using a larger number of horses is warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the nature of multinucleated and mononuclear cells from peripheral giant cell granuloma (PGCG). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of 40 cases of PGCG were immunohistochemically stained for vimentin, alpha I-antichymotrypsin, CD68, S-100 protein, lysozyme. leucocyte common antigen (LCA), factor VIII-retated antigen and muscle cell actin. Six cases of PGCG were also studied by transmission etectron microscopy. RESULTS: Vimentin, alpha I-antichymotrypsin and CD68 were expressed in both the mononuclear and multinucleated giant cells. Dendritic mononuclear cells, positive for 5?100 protein, were noted in 67.5% of the lesions, whereas lysozyme and leucocyte common antigen were detected in occasional mononuclear cells. Ultrastructural examination showed mononuclear cells with signs of phagocytosis and sometimes interdigitations with similar cells. Others presented non-specific characteristics and the third type exhibited cytoplasmic processes and occasional Birbeck granules. Some multi-nucleated giant cells showed oval nuclei, abundant mitochondria and granular endoplasmic reticulum whereas others presented with irregular nuclei and a great number of cytoplasmic vacuoles. CONCLUSIONS: lmmunohistochemical and ultrastructural results suggest that PGCGs of the jaws are composed mainly of cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system and that Langerhans cells are present in two thirds of the lesions.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare the respective effects of propofol and emulsified isoflurane administered alone and in combination with dexmedetomidine on the quality of induction of anesthesia, physiological variables and recovery in dogs. Study design Prospective, randomized, experimental trial. Animals Thirty-six adult mixed-breed dogs. Methods Animals were randomly assigned to one of four induction protocols: propofol alone (group P); emulsified isoflurane alone (group EI); both propofol and dexmedetomidine (group PD), or both emulsified isoflurane and dexmedetomidine (group EID). Pulse rate (PR), respiratory rate (fR), non-invasive arterial blood pressure and arterial blood gases were measured at baseline, before induction, immediately after intubation (time 0), and at 5 minute intervals until the dog began to swallow and the trachea was extubated. The quality of induction and recovery, and degree of ataxia were scored by a single investigator unaware of group assignment. The durations of anesthesia and recovery, and the incidence of adverse events were recorded. Results There were no clinically significant differences among the groups in induction quality. Systolic arterial pressure was lower in EID compared with P at 5 minutes. PR and fR were lower in PD and EID compared with P after induction. The PaCO2 at 5 minutes was higher than at baseline in group P. Ataxia score was lower in EID than in P. Time from induction to extubation and time from extubation to sternal recumbency were lower in EID compared with PD. Conclusions and clinical relevance There were no clinically significant differences among the groups in induction quality. In PD and EID, but not in P, PR and fR were decreased after induction. The EID combination resulted in smooth and rapid induction and recovery and thus may be useful clinically for induction of anesthesia.

AB  - Summary The gruelling race schedules maintained by horses competing in chuckwagon racing raises concern for the horses' ability to recover quickly and continue to perform at a high level. The amount of bodyweight lost and the time required for recovery of this weight loss have been used to assess the level of stress imposed on horses competing in various multiple-day events. In this study, bodyweights were obtained from 40 Thoroughbred geldings (mean ± s.e.; bodyweight 521.5 ± 4.4 kg) before and after racing during a 5 day chuckwagon race meet. Body condition score (BCS) was determined on the first and last day of competition. Comparisons were based on the number of consecutive days the horse raced. Average bodyweight loss (P = 0.039) from each race was 3.5 ± 0.3 kg (0.7% of initial bodyweight) and was not affected by the number of days the horse raced. The largest bodyweight deficit (P = 0.005) occurred within the 24 h period after their first race (5.3 ± 0.5 kg; 1.0% of initial bodyweight). Horses racing on 2?5 consecutive days retained a 4.8 ± 0.3 kg deficit (P = 0.01), which was maintained throughout the remainder of the race meet. Horses began and ended the race meet with a BCS of 4.9 ± 0.2 and 4.7 ± 0.2, respectively (using the 1 to 9 BCS system). Although chuckwagon horses compete in a strenuous event on several consecutive days, they appear to be managed well and have the ability to maintain their bodyweight despite the physical and psychological demands of frequent racing.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Danofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone developed for veterinary medicine showing an excellent activity. However, danofloxacin pharmacokinetics profile have not been studied in horses previously. Objective: To study the pharmacokinetics following i.v., i.m. and intragastric (i.g.) administration of 1.25 mg/kg bwt danofloxacin to 6 healthy horses. Methods: A cross-over design was used in 3 phases (2 times 2 ? 2), with 2 washout periods of 15 days (n = 6). Danofloxacin (18%) was administered by i.v. and i.m. routes at single doses of 1.25 mg/kg bwt. For i.g. administration an oral solution was prepared and administered via nasogastric tube. Danofloxacin concentrations were determined by HPLC assay with fluorescence detection. Tolerability at the the site of i.m. injection was monitored by creatine kinase (CK) activity. Results: Danofloxacin plasma concentration vs. time data after i.v. and i.g. administration could best be described by a 2-compartment open model. The disposition of i.m. administered danofloxacin was best described by a one-compartment model. The terminal half-lives for i.v., i.m. and i.g. routes were 6.31, 5.36 and 4.74 h, respectively. Clearance value after i.v. dosing was 0.34 l/kg bwt/h. After i.m. administration, absolute bioavailability was mean ± s.d. 88.48 ± 11.10% and Cmax was 0.35 ± 0.05 mg/l. After i.g. administration, absolute bioavailability was 22.36 ± 6.84% and Cmax 0.21 ± 0.07 mg/l. CK activity following i.m. dosing increased 3-fold over pre-injection levels 12 h after dosing and subsequently approached (but did not reach) normal values at 72 h post dose. Conclusions: Systemic danofloxacin exposure achieved in horses following i.m. administration was consistent with the predicted blood levels needed for a positive therapeutic outcome for many equine infections. Conversely, danofloxacin utility by the i.g. route was limited by low bioavailability. Tolerability associated with i.m. administration was high. Potential relevance: Pharmacokinetics, blood levels and good tolerability of i.v. and i.m. administration of danofloxacin in horses indicates that it is likely to be effective for treating sensitive bacterial infections.

AB  - Abstract Aims and objectives To evaluate whether implementing the Modified Early Warning Scoring system impacts nurses? free text notes related to Airway, Breathing, Circulation and Pain in general ward medical and surgical patients. Background The quality of nursing documentation in patient health records is important to secure patient safety, but faces multiple challenges whether being paper-based or electronic. Nurses? ability to draw a complete picture of the patient situation is thereby compromised. Structured use of the Modified Early Warning Score, found to reduce unexpected death, might affect nurses? free text documentation of clinical observations. Design A prospective, pre- and postinterventional, nonrandomised study adhering to the EQUATOR guideline TREND. Methods Data on nurses? free text notes were obtained in 1,497 patient records during one preinterventional (March?June 2009) and two postinterventional study periods (September?December 2010 and March?June 2011) in a Danish university hospital. Data were organised by the Airway, Breathing and Circulation principles and by nurses? working shifts in the 56 hr surrounding the first recording of deviating vital parameters or a Modified Early Warning Score ≥ 2. Preinterventional free text notes were compared with notes from the two postinterventional periods, respectively. Results In the 8-hr working shift where deviations in vital parameters were recorded for the first time, nurses? free text notes related to patients? breathing (B) increased significantly, comparing 2009 with 2010 and 2011, respectively. In the 24 hr following initial deviations in vital parameters, a significant increase in free text notes was identified concerning Airway, Breathing and Circulation-related symptoms or problems. Conclusion Mandatory use of the Modified Early Warning Score and related implementation activities significantly impacts nursing documentation of free text notes. Relevance to clinical practice Nurses? practice of communicating observed clinical symptoms by documenting free text notes should be supported through measures to enhance situation awareness.

AB  - BACKGROUND Astronauts on exploration missions may be at risk for traumatic injury and medical conditions that lead to life threatening hemorrhage. Resuscitation protocols are limited by the austere conditions of spaceflight. Solutions may be found in low-resource terrestrial settings. The existing literature on alternative blood product administration and walking blood banks was evaluated for applicability to spaceflight. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A literature review was done using PubMed and Google Scholar. References were crosschecked for additional publications not identified using the initial search terms. Twenty-seven articles were identified, including three controlled trials, six retrospective cohort analyses, 15 reviews, one case report, and two experimental studies. RESULTS Solutions to blood transfusion in austere settings include lyophilized blood products, hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs), and fresh whole blood. Many of these products are investigational. Protocols for walking blood banks include methods for screening and activating donors, transfusion, and monitoring for adverse reactions. Microgravity and mission limitations create additional challenges for transfusion, including baseline physiologic changes, difficulty reconstituting lyophilized products, risk of air emboli during transfusion, equipment constraints, and limited evacuation and surgical options. CONCLUSION Medical planning for space exploration should consider the possibility of acute blood loss. A model for ?floating? blood banks based on terrestrial walking blood bank protocols from austere environments is presented, with suggestions for future development. Constraints on volume, mass, storage, and crew, present challenges to blood transfusion in space and must be weighed against the benefits of expanding medical capabilities.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis The murine model has been used extensively to model and study human deafness. Technical difficulty in the surgical approach due to the small size of the tympanic bulla and a robust stapedial artery has limited its application for studies of cochlear implantation and electrical stimulation. We describe a minimally traumatic, stapedial artery?sparing approach to the round window that may be used to access the mouse cochlea for acute or chronic studies of implantation and stimulation. Study Design Animal model. Methods Fifteen C57BL6J mice were used to validate this approach. Auditory brainstem response threshold and distortion product otoacoustic emissions were obtained preoperatively and 2 weeks postoperatively to determine hearing preservation results. Results The approach provided excellent exposure for round-window implantation. Substantial hearing was preserved in all animals with a mean postimplantation auditory brainstem response threshold increase of 27.8 dB. Otoacoustic emissions were lost in subjects with the largest threshold shifts. Conclusions Residual hearing after cochlear implantation is a determinant of success both with standard cochlear implant electrodes and with electrodes designed to optimize hearing preservation. Here, we have preserved usable hearing after implantation of C57BL6J mice, an endogenous model of human presbycusia. The murine model may become a powerful tool to assay the effects of cochlear intervention in different genetic backgrounds. Laryngoscope, 123:E109?E115, 2013

AB  - Summary Background Suspensory ligament branch injuries are common in horses. Most of these injuries are grouped together and considered as a single pathologic entity. Objectives To report a specific injury of the abaxial margin of the suspensory ligament branches and to report its surgical management and outcome. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods All horses with suspensory ligament branch injuries over a 9-year period (2007?2015) were identified. Horses with injuries which, on ultrasonographic examination, appeared to have defects in the abaxial margin of the suspensory ligament branch, that were subsequently confirmed during surgery were selected. Results Twenty-nine cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria with a specific lesion location on the abaxial margin of the suspensory ligament branch. Nineteen horses raced successfully after surgery, nine returned to training but failed to race and one was lost to follow-up. Main limitations The absence of a comparable population of non-surgically managed horses in this study means that the contribution of removing torn tissue cannot confidently be assessed. Conclusions The location and morphology of injuries described in this study is consistent, which suggests aetiopathogenic commonality. This case series suggests this type of injury has an identity of its own, differs from other types of suspensory ligament branch injuries and represents a previously undescribed subgroup.

AB  - Summary Functional activities (phagocytosis and killing) of neutrophil leucocytes (NL) and immunoglobulin G concentrations were evaluated in six healthy foals from birth to 6 months of age. Peripheral blood NL were reacted with Streptococcus equisimilis in 20 per cent pooled equine serum for 30, 60 and 90 mins and functional activities of NL were determined using a fluorochrome microassay. Values for foal NL function were compared with those of healthy adult horses (n = 28). Foal neutrophil function was influenced by age. Killing capacity of NL decreased, whereas phagocytic capacity increased, until 113 days of age, after which a reversal in trends became apparent. Immunoglobulin G concentrations changed significantly over time and were lowest at 29 to 56 days of age. All foal values for NL function fell within the range of normal values established for healthy adult horses.

AB  - Abstract Interacting proteins assemble into molecular machines that control cellular homeostasis in living cells. While the in vitro screening methods have the advantage of providing direct access to the genetic information encoding unknown protein partners, they do not allow direct access to interactions of these protein partners in their natural environment inside the living cell. Using wide-field, confocal, or two-photon (2p) fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy, this information can be obtained from living cells and tissues with nanometer resolution. One of the important conditions for FRET to occur is the overlap of the emission spectrum of the donor with the absorption spectrum of the acceptor. As a result of spectral overlap, the FRET signal is always contaminated by donor emission into the acceptor channel and by the excitation of acceptor molecules by the donor excitation wavelength. Mathematical algorithms are required to correct the spectral bleed-through signal in wide-field, confocal, and two-photon FRET microscopy. In contrast, spectral bleed-through is not an issue in FRET/FLIM imaging because only the donor fluorophore lifetime is measured; also, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) measurements are independent of excitation intensity or fluorophore concentration. The combination of FRET and FLIM provides high spatial (nanometer) and temporal (nanosecond) resolution when compared to intensity-based FRET imaging. In this paper, we describe various FRET microscopy techniques and its application to protein-protein interactions.

AB  - Abstract Injectable bone substitutes (IBSs) represent an attractive class of ready-to-use biomaterials, both ceramic- and polymer-based, as they offer the potential benefit of minimally invasive surgery and optimal defect filling. Although in vitro assessments are the first step in the process of development, the safety and efficacy of an IBS strongly depend on validated preclinical research prior to clinical trials. However, the selection of a suitable preclinical model for performance evaluation of an IBS remains a challenge, as no gold standard exists to define the best animal model. In order to succeed in this attempt, we identified three stages of development, including (a) proof-of-principle, (b) predictive validity and (c) general scientific legitimacy, and the respective criteria that should be applied for such selection. The second part of this review provides an overview of commonly used animals for IBSs. Specifically, scientific papers published between January 1996 and March 2012 were retrieved that report the use of preclinical models for the evaluation of IBSs in situations requiring bone healing and bone augmentation. This review is meant not only to describe the currently available preclinical models for IBS application, but also to address critical considerations of such multi-factorial evaluation models (including animal species, strain, age, anatomical site, defect size and type of bone), which can be indicative but in most cases edge away from the human reality. Consequently, the ultimate goal is to guide researchers toward a more careful and meaningful interpretation of the results of experiments using animal models and their clinical applications.

AB  - Summary Background Limited information exists on the long-term outcome of foals that survive following hospitalisation for disease as a neonate. Significant financial investment is required to raise foals to racing age, therefore improved understanding of factors that affect long-term outcome and future athletic performance is important. Objectives To analyse racing performance in Thoroughbred foals hospitalised as neonates, compared with their maternal siblings and to determine factors associated with failure to race and racing performance. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods Medical records of Thoroughbred foals admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit between 1982 and 2008 were reviewed. Surviving foals of registered mares were included. Data including the foal's primary and concurrent diseases were extracted from the medical record. Racing records for foals and maternal siblings were evaluated. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify disorders associated with failure to race and decreased racing performance. Results Two-hundred and sixty-nine of 454 previously hospitalised foals (59%) raced. Sixty-eight percent (269/394) of registered foals raced, compared with 79% (697/880) of registered siblings. Foals with prematurity/dysmaturity (P = 0.002) and those with orthopaedic disease (P = 0.007) were significantly less likely to race than their siblings. Premature/dysmature foals also had significantly fewer starts and wins and lower earnings than siblings. Foals with orthopaedic disorders had a lower percentage of wins, relative to their siblings. There was no significant association between racing performance and other disease categories. Main limitations Small sample size in some disease categories and retrospective nature of study. Conclusions Foals hospitalised due to prematurity/dysmaturity or orthopaedic disorders were less likely to race than their maternal siblings and those that did race had decreased performance.
