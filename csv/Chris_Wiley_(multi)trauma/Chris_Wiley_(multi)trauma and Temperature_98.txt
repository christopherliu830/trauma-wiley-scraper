AB  - Abstract A novel living hyaline cartilage graft (LhCG) with controllable dimensions and free of non-cartilaginous constituents for articular regeneration is developed. As a living graft for regenerative medicine, LhCG is purely living tissue based and truly scaffold-free. The process of neotissue formation in LhCG is mediated by an interim biomaterial-based novel scaffolding system. This design highlights a philosophy of using biomaterials in engineered regenerative medicine as a transient guiding facility rather than a permanent part of substitute. The fabrication is designed and practiced in a continuous and integrated process, which attributes to its simplicity in operation. Because of the intrinsic non-cell-adhesive property of hydrogel scaffolds, articular chondrocytes? phenotype is always preserved throughout the whole procedure, which has been tested and approved both in vitro and in vivo. In situ grafting trials in a rabbit model showcase high success rates in both cartilage repair and graft-host integration. Beyond cartilage repair, this LhCG model may provide a living-tissue-based open platform or niche for multi-tissue regenerations.

AB  - An 8-year-old Pêga breed donkey that presented with a history of persistent enlargement of the right leg was diagnosed with a rhabdomyosarcoma by surgical exploration and biopsy. The tumoral mass involved the medial and posterior aspects of the thigh. At presentation, the donkey was extremely painful and reluctant to walk. Initial physical examination showed a heart rate of 60 beats/min, respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min, and a rectal temperature of 100.2°F. Venous blood was collected for a CBC and biochemistry. Postoperative care included antibiotic (potassium penicillin and gentamicin) and anti-inflammatory (phenylbutazone and dexamethasone). The donkey was very painful in the immediate postoperative period and developed dehiscence of the incision. It was unable to bear weight on the affected limb, very reluctant to walk, and lying down in sternal recumbency most of the time. Heart and respiratory rates ranged from 60 to 90 and 20 to 32, respectively. Because of the poor prognosis, euthanasia was indicated but the owner decided to keep the donkey alive to try semen collection. In order to improve life quality and making the semen collection possible, the anti-inflammatory therapy was stopped and an analgesic therapy with epidural opioids was selected. A 20-gauge epidural catheter was inserted in the first intercoccygeal space through an epidural Huber point needle. With the purpose of reaching the lumbosacral area, 20?cm of the catheter was advanced cranially from the needle tip. During 3 days, a combination of morphine (0.1?mg/kg) and tramadol (0.5?mg/kg) was administered daily with a total volume of 20?ml. During the first 24 hours after the first administration, heart rate ranged from 62 to 64 and respiratory rate from 20 to 24. It was not observed to have any adverse effect. The donkey improved during treatment standing most of the time and eating better. It was easier to hand walk, although it was not completely able to bear weight in the affected limb. Even during treatment, the donkey reacted intensely when the surgical area in the caudal aspect of the thigh was manipulated. On the forth day, it tried to copulate and semen was successfully collected by manipulation of the penis. As the semen was not classified as good enough to be frozen, the donkey was euthanatized. On post-mortem examination, the position of the catheter in the epidural canal was observed and 20?ml of methylene blue solution injected through the catheter before euthanasia. It was enough to totally stain the segment of epidural canal from the first intercoccygeal space to the lumbosacral joint. The opioid epidural analgesic therapy reported here was considered to be efficient to treat the painful condition of the donkey, but it was not able to completely abolish the pain.

AB  - Summary Functional activities (phagocytosis and killing) of neutrophil leucocytes (NL) and immunoglobulin G concentrations were evaluated in six healthy foals from birth to 6 months of age. Peripheral blood NL were reacted with Streptococcus equisimilis in 20 per cent pooled equine serum for 30, 60 and 90 mins and functional activities of NL were determined using a fluorochrome microassay. Values for foal NL function were compared with those of healthy adult horses (n = 28). Foal neutrophil function was influenced by age. Killing capacity of NL decreased, whereas phagocytic capacity increased, until 113 days of age, after which a reversal in trends became apparent. Immunoglobulin G concentrations changed significantly over time and were lowest at 29 to 56 days of age. All foal values for NL function fell within the range of normal values established for healthy adult horses.

AB  - Summary Background Limited information exists on the long-term outcome of foals that survive following hospitalisation for disease as a neonate. Significant financial investment is required to raise foals to racing age, therefore improved understanding of factors that affect long-term outcome and future athletic performance is important. Objectives To analyse racing performance in Thoroughbred foals hospitalised as neonates, compared with their maternal siblings and to determine factors associated with failure to race and racing performance. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods Medical records of Thoroughbred foals admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit between 1982 and 2008 were reviewed. Surviving foals of registered mares were included. Data including the foal's primary and concurrent diseases were extracted from the medical record. Racing records for foals and maternal siblings were evaluated. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify disorders associated with failure to race and decreased racing performance. Results Two-hundred and sixty-nine of 454 previously hospitalised foals (59%) raced. Sixty-eight percent (269/394) of registered foals raced, compared with 79% (697/880) of registered siblings. Foals with prematurity/dysmaturity (P = 0.002) and those with orthopaedic disease (P = 0.007) were significantly less likely to race than their siblings. Premature/dysmature foals also had significantly fewer starts and wins and lower earnings than siblings. Foals with orthopaedic disorders had a lower percentage of wins, relative to their siblings. There was no significant association between racing performance and other disease categories. Main limitations Small sample size in some disease categories and retrospective nature of study. Conclusions Foals hospitalised due to prematurity/dysmaturity or orthopaedic disorders were less likely to race than their maternal siblings and those that did race had decreased performance.

AB  - Summary Background Few noninvasive methods are available for equine hoof wall evaluation. The highly organised wall structures and composition of proteoglycans and collagens may make this region amenable to quantitative MRI (qMRI) techniques of T1? and T2 mapping to identify pathology related to proteoglycan content and collagen organisation respectively. Objective To establish normative T1? and T2 values of the equine hoof wall of 3-year-old Quarter Horses with histological comparison. Study design Cadaveric anatomical study. Methods Six cadaveric left thoracic feet from 3-year-old racing Quarter Horses with no reported lameness were evaluated using T1? and T2 mapping. Mapping was performed at six regions of interest at the toe of each hoof including proximal and distal regions of the inner epidermis, stratum lamellatum and corium. Histology was evaluated for standard hoof morphology and proteoglycan staining. Results T2 values of the stratum lamellatum and corium were similar (42.9 [95% CI: 41.6?44.2] ms and 44 [95% CI: 42.7?45.3] ms respectively), but both were significantly different to the inner epidermis (35.8 [95% CI: 34.5?37.1] ms, P<0.001). T1? values for the inner epidermis, stratum lamellatum and corium were significantly different (25.1 [95% CI: 23.1?27.1] ms, 44.4 [95% CI: 42.4?46.4] ms and 50.1 [95% CI: 48.1?52.1] ms, respectively, P<0.001). Histology demonstrated normal organised morphology. Proteoglycan staining was only visible in the stratum lamellatum and corium. Main limitations Cadaveric study with frozen samples used. Conclusions Variation of qMRI metrics through the depth of the equine hoof wall was found. Although the highly ordered environment of collagen may contribute to T2 values, there was lack of evidence to support proteoglycan content as a major contributor of T1? values. It is possible T1? values had a greater dependence on total water content as the lowest values were seen in the epidermis. Additional research using qMRI is needed to determine mapping values in different disease states.

AB  - Abstract Intubation of children outside of the operating room is performed infrequently and is often associated with life-threatening adverse events. This review aims to clarify the contributors to adverse events encountered during intubations outside of the operating room and provide preventative strategies. The primary contributors to adverse events during non-operating room intubations are physiologically and situationally difficult airways; anatomically difficult airways are rare. Systems-based changes, including a shared mental model, standardization in equipment and its location, checklist use, physiological resuscitation prior to resuscitation, dose titration of induction agent, multi-disciplinary team training in the technical and nontechnical aspects of non-operating room intubation, debrief post?real and simulated events, and regular audit of performance all reduce life-threatening intubation-related adverse events in children. Intubation of children outside of the operating room may be performed safely through engagement of all critical care specialties, shared learning, and focus on patient-centered care delivery.

AB  - Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is linked to certain common brain pathologies (e.g., ischemia, stroke, and trauma) believed to facilitate its development and progression. One of the logical approaches to this problem is to study the effects of ischemia and hypoxia on the metabolism of amyloid precursor protein, which plays one of the key roles in the pathogenesis of AD. This involves an analysis of (1) proteases, which participate in proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein either by the nonamyloidogenic route (α-secretase) or the amyloidogenic pathway and lead to formation of toxic ?-amyloid peptides (?- and ?-secretases) and (2) several metallopeptidases that might play a role in degradation of ?-amyloid peptide (A?). The study of the effects of prenatal hypoxia and acute hypoxia in adult animals allowed us to conclude that oxygen deprivation results not only in an increase of amyloid precursor protein expression in the brain but also in a decrease in the activity of α-secretase. In some brain structures involved in AD pathology (the cortex and striatum), we also observed a decrease in the expression of two of the A? degrading enzymes, neprilysin and endothelin-converting enzyme, after hypoxia. A decrease in expression of these metalloproteases was also observed in the model of four-vessel occlusion ischemia in rats with their restoration to the control levels after reperfusion. Preconditioning to mild hypoxia both in the prenatal period and in adults appeared to have a neuroprotective effect restoring, in particular, the levels of amyloid precursor protein, activity of a-secretase, and expression of neprilysin and endothelin-converting enzyme to their control values.

AB  - Summary It has been reported that a small decrease in the strain in the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) occurs if the toe is raised during walking. Although walking on a slope appears similar to raising the toe, it is unclear whether uphill exercise decreases the strain in the SDFT. Because the force or strain on tendons is one of the important factors leading to tendon stress injury, we hypothesised that reducing the force in the SDFT during exercise may prevent tendinitis. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of treadmill inclination on the force in the SDFT in the walking horse. ?Arthroscopically implantable force probes? (AIFP) were implanted into the SDFT of the forelimb of 4 horses. The AIFP output was recorded during walking on a treadmill inclined at 0%, 3%, 8% and then 0% again. When the inclination increased from 0 to 8%, the first peak of force in the SDFT decreased significantly, the second increased significantly, but the maximal force and the area under the force-time curve did not change. In conclusion, uphill walking on an inclined treadmill did not decrease the maximal force in the SDFT or the area under the force-time curve, however, the patterns of force were altered. Future research should focus on the force distributions of tendons and ligaments at faster gaits, because the effects of a change in hoof angle and slope may be greater at faster gaits.

The hybrid scaffold has shown promise as a potential strategy for the treatment of such defects. In this study, a novel biomimetic porous collagen (Col)/hydroxyapatite (HA) scaffold was fabricated through assembling layers of Col containing gradual amount of HA under the assistance of ?iterative layering? freeze-drying process. The scaffold presents a double gradient of highly interconnected porosity and HA content from top to bottom, mimicking the inherent physiological structure of bone. Owing to the biomimetic structure and component, significant increase of cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, and osteogenic differentiation in vitro was observed, illustrating potential application of the excellent Col/HA scaffold as a promising strategy for bone tissue engineering. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Emergency personnel, like all workers, carry out their duties within an environment composed of a set of discrete elements. First, there is the emergency itself. Whether a forest fire in France, a tornado in the American Midwest, or a mining disaster in Russia, the emergency imposes certain exigencies upon the responders. Second, a social structure exists with specific social units, rules, and forms of association. An emergency response, therefore, takes place within a context of prescribed behaviors, expectations, and value judgments that are sometimes in conflict with each other. Third, there is a technology that must be understood in order to accomplish group goals. If the technology itself is implicated in the emergency, the entire emergency environment may be impacted. Clearly, a breakdown in any of these elements could result in worker injury and might heighten responder stress. This paper discusses how emergency workers not only get injured but may come to experience burn-out, post-traumatic stress syndrome, or impaired work and family relationships, even though their normal work setting (the emergency) is expected to be ?abnormal?. The authors suggest areas in each of the three environmental elements that deserve further inquiry.

AB  - The superficial regions of the left vagus nerves of a dog were selectively stimulated with 39-electrode spiral cuffs having 13 circumferential groups of three electrodes (GTE) to modulate the function of the innervated internal organs and glands. Under general anaesthesia, the cuffs were chronically implanted around the nerve in the neck in two adult Beagle dogs and remained viable for 16 months. The regions were stimulated with biphasic, rectangular current pulses (2 mA, 200 ?s, 20 Hz) delivered to the group of GTE lying close to the region innervating the specific internal organs or glands. The results showed that specific electrode configurations had actions on the heart (GTE 9), lungs (GTE 4) and pressure in the urinary bladder (GTE 1). It was also shown that GTE no. 10 significantly modified the endocrine function of the pancreas. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that internal organs and glands can be selectively stimulated via the selective stimulation of innervating superficial regions of the autonomous peripheral nerve.

AB  - Objectives: To analyse the direct antiproliferative effects of both piroxicam and meloxicam at a variety of concentrations on a series of canine cancer cell lines and the mechanism of cell death. Methods: The in vitro effects of piroxicam and meloxicam at various concentrations on canine cell cultures (Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, osteosarcoma, mammary carcinoma, and lymphoma) were assessed with respect to proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction. Western blot analysis of cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 expression was performed on all cell lines. Results: All cell lines used in this study were cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 positive apart from Madin-Darby canine kidney cells which were negative for both cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2. Both meloxicam and piroxicam were able to inhibit proliferation in cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. However, the drug concentration required for a given effect was cell line dependent. Clinical Significance: The results suggest that significant inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis would only occur when drug concentrations were in excess of those that can be achieved in vivo following maximum recommended dose rates. It is possible, however, that local or topical treatment or altered dosing regimens may offer alternative approaches to the use of these drugs as antineoplastic agents.

A significant contributor to the development of SIRS in human subjects is delayed neutrophil apoptosis, but this has not been specifically studied in horses. Objectives To determine the occurrence of ex vivo neutrophil apoptosis and its contribution to the development of SIRS in an equine colitis model. Study design Experiment using a colitis model. Methods Neutrophils were isolated before and after the induction of colitis using an oligofructose overdose model, placed into culture for 12 h or 24 h with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at various concentrations, and assessed for the occurrence of apoptosis using Annexin V and propidium iodide staining with flow cytometric quantification. Levels of caspase-3, -8 and -9 activity were measured after 12 h of incubation in neutrophil lysates. Results Ex vivo neutrophil apoptosis was significantly delayed in neutrophils isolated after the induction of colitis (12-h incubation: P = 0.004; 24-h incubation: P = 0.003) with concomitant reductions in caspase-3, -8 and -9 activity (caspase-3: P = 0.004; caspase-8: P = 0.02; caspase-9: P = 0.02). Neutrophils isolated after the induction of colitis were refractory to LPS-delayed apoptosis. Neutrophil apoptosis was delayed with increasing cell concentration in vitro. Main limitations The main limitation of the study is the that the exact mechanism for delayed neutrophil apoptosis following the induction of colitis was not fully elucidated. Conclusions The data show that neutrophil apoptosis is delayed in horses following the induction of colitis as a result of interference with the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways, which may contribute to the development of equine SIRS. Concurrent development of neutrophilia may contribute to a prolonged neutrophil lifespan through a concentration-dependent delay in apoptosis.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Information regarding movement at the ilium and sacrum in nonlame horses during normal gait may assist in understanding the biomechanics of the equine sacroiliac joint. Objectives: To determine the amount and direction of motion at the ilium and sacrum using 3D orientation sensors during walk and trot in sound Thoroughbreds. To compare results from sensors fixed to the skin with results from sensors fixed to bone-implanted pins. Methods: Three 3D wireless orientation sensors were mounted to the skin over the tuber sacrale (TS) and sacrum of 6 horses and motion at the ilium and sacrum was recorded for lateral bending (LB) flexion-extension (F-E) and axial rotation (AR) during walk and trot. This process was repeated with the orientation sensors mounted to the same pelvic landmarks via Steinmann pins. Results: Mean walk values were greater than trot values using pin-mounted sensors for all planes of movement (P<0.05). Walk had 1.64?±?0.22° (mean?±?s.e.) more LB than trot (pin-mounted) yet 0.68?±?0.22° less than trot when skin-mounted; 3.45?±?0.15° more F-E (pin- and skin-mounted), and 4.99?±?0.4° more AR (pin-mounted), but trot had 3.4?±?0.40° more AR than walk with skin mounting. Using pinned sensors for trot resulted in less LB (2.47?±?0.22°), F-E (1.12?±?0.15°) and AR (10.62?±?0.40°); and for walk less F-E (1.12?±?0.15°) and AR (2.15?±?0.40°) compared to skin-mounted. Poor correlation existed between mean values for skin- and pin-mounted data for walk and trot, for all planes of motion. Conclusions: Movements were smaller at trot with bone-fixated sensors compared to walk, suggesting increased muscular control of movement at the trot. The apparent increase in skin motion at the trot and no clear correlation between skin- and bone-mounted sensors indicates inaccuracies when measuring sacral and iliac movement with skin mounting.

AB  - ? Premise of the study: Shoot architecture is a fundamentally developmental aspect of plant biology with implications for plant form, function, reproduction, and life history evolution. Mimulus guttatus is morphologically diverse and becoming a model for evolutionary biology. Shoot architecture, however, has never been studied from a developmental perspective in M. guttatus. ? Methods: We examined the development of branches and flowers in plants from two locally adapted populations of M. guttatus with contrasting flowering times, life histories, and branch numbers. We planted second-generation seed in growth chambers to control for maternal and environmental effects. ? Key results: Most branches occurred at nodes one and two of the main axis. Onset of branching occurred earlier and at a greater frequency in perennials than in annuals. In perennials, almost all flowers occurred at the fifth or more distal nodes. In annuals, most flowers occurred at the third and more distal nodes. Accessory axillary meristems and higher-order branching did not influence shoot architecture. ? Conclusions: We found no evidence for trade-offs between flowers and branches because axillary meristem number was not limiting: a large number of meristems remained quiescent. If, however, quiescence is a component of meristem allocation strategy, then meristems may be limited despite presence of quiescent meristems. At the two basalmost nodes, branch number was determined by mechanisms governing either meristem initiation or outgrowth, rather than flowering vs. branching. At the third and more distal nodes, heterochronic processes contributed to flowering time and branch number differences between populations.

AB  - Abstract The calpain family of calcium-dependent proteases has been implicated in a variety of diseases and neurodegenerative pathologies. Prolonged activation of calpains results in proteolysis of numerous cellular substrates including cytoskeletal components and membrane receptors, contributing to cell demise despite coincident expression of calpastatin, the specific inhibitor of calpains. Pharmacological and gene-knockout strategies have targeted calpains to determine their contribution to neurodegenerative pathology; however, limitations associated with treatment paradigms, drug specificity, and genetic disruptions have produced inconsistent results and complicated interpretation. Specific, targeted calpain inhibition achieved by enhancing endogenous calpastatin levels offers unique advantages in studying pathological calpain activation. We have characterized a novel calpastatin-overexpressing transgenic mouse model, demonstrating a substantial increase in calpastatin expression within nervous system and peripheral tissues and associated reduction in protease activity. Experimental activation of calpains via traumatic brain injury resulted in cleavage of α-spectrin, collapsin response mediator protein-2, and voltage-gated sodium channel, critical proteins for the maintenance of neuronal structure and function. Calpastatin overexpression significantly attenuated calpain-mediated proteolysis of these selected substrates acutely following severe controlled cortical impact injury, but with no effect on acute hippocampal neurodegeneration. Augmenting calpastatin levels may be an effective method for calpain inhibition in traumatic brain injury and neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - As an Extracellular Matrix (ECM) component, Hyaluronic acid (HA) plays a multi-faceted role in cell migration, proliferation and differentiation at micro level and system level events such as tissue water homeostasis. Among its biological functions, it is known to interact with cytokines and contribute to their retention in ECM microenvironment. In addition to its biological functions, it has advantageous physical properties which result in the industrial endeavors in the synthesis and extraction of HA for variety of applications ranging from medical to cosmetic. Recently, HA and its derivatives have been the focus of active research for applications in biomedical device coatings, drug delivery systems and in the form of scaffolds or cell-laden hydrogels for tissue engineering. A specific reason for the increase in use of HA based structures is their immunomodulatory and regeneration inducing capacities. In this context, this article reviews recent literature on modulation of the implantable biomaterial microenvironment by systems based on HA and its derivatives, particularly hydrogels and microscale coatings that are able to deliver cytokines in order to reduce the adverse immune reactions and promote tissue healing.
