AB  - Abstract Injuries to peripheral nerves and/or skeletal muscle can cause scar tissue formation and loss of function. The focus of this article is the creation of a conductive, biocompatible scaffold with appropriate mechanical properties to regenerate skeletal muscle. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) nanoparticles (Np) were electrospun with poly(?-caprolactone) (PCL) to form conductive scaffolds. During electrospinning, ribboning, larger fiber diameters, and unaligned scaffolds were observed with increasing PEDOT amounts. To address this, PEDOT Np were sonicated prior to electrospinning, which resulted in decreased conductivity and increased mechanical properties. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) were added to the 1:2 solution in an effort to increase conductivity. However, the addition of MWCNT had little effect on scaffold conductivity, and the elastic modulus and yield stress of the scaffold increased as a result. Rat muscle cells attached and were active on the 1?10, 1?2, 3?4, and 1?1 PCL-PEDOT scaffolds; however, the 3?4 scaffolds had the lowest level of metabolic activity. Although the scaffolds were cytocompatible, further development of the fabrication method is necessary to produce more highly aligned scaffolds capable of promoting skeletal muscle cell alignment and eventual regeneration. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a limbic structure that is involved in the expression of conditioned contextual fear. Among the numerous neural inputs to the BNST, noradrenergic synaptic terminals are prominent and some evidence suggests an activation of this noradrenergic neurotransmission in the BNST during aversive situations. Here, we have investigated the involvement of the BNST noradrenergic system in the modulation of behavioural and autonomic responses induced by conditioned contextual fear in rats. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Male Wistar rats with cannulae bilaterally implanted into the BNST were submitted to a 10 min conditioning session (6 footshocks, 1.5 ma/ 3 s). Twenty-four hours later freezing and autonomic responses (mean arterial pressure, heart rate and cutaneous temperature) to the conditioning box were measured for 10 min. The adrenoceptor antagonists were administered 10 min before the re-exposure to the aversive context. KEY RESULTS L-propranolol, a non-selective ?-adrenoceptor antagonist, and phentolamine, a non-selective α-adrenoceptor antagonist, reduced both freezing and autonomic responses induced by aversive context. Similar results were observed with CGP20712, a selective ?1-adrenoceptor antagonist, and WB4101, a selective α1-antagonist, but not with ICI118,551, a selective ?2-adrenoceptor antagonist or RX821002, a selective α2-antagonist. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS These findings support the idea that noradrenergic neurotransmission in the BNST via α1- and ?1-adrenoceptors is involved in the expression of conditioned contextual fear.

AB  - Summary ?? Neither anatomical change nor physiological abnormalities have been observed in the cambia of older trees. However, different sensitivity and period of significant responses to climate suggest the existence of some age-related change in the patterns of cambial activity and/or wood cell formation. ?? Here, weekly cambial activity and timing and duration of xylem cell enlargement and wall thickening were compared in adult (50?80 yr) and old (200?350 yr) trees of Larix decidua, Pinus cembra and Picea abies at the Alpine timberline during 2004 and 2005. ?? Timings and durations of xylogenesis differed between adult and old trees, with 2?3 wk shorter cambial activity found in the latter. The delayed onset of cambium division and lower cell production in old trees, with respect to adult trees, led to reductions of 15?20% in the overall duration of xylem differentiation. ?? These results demonstrate that cambial dynamics change during the tree lifespan and that the time window of tree-ring production shortens with age. Variations in the period of xylem growth may be the cause of age-dependent responses to climate. The observed shorter xylogenesis in older plants at the Alpine timberline could be related to a size effect and not just to age per se.

AB  - Abstract ObjectivesThe objectives of this study are to compare the effects of two nursing intervention models on the ability of preschool children with malignant tumors to socialize and to determine if these interventions improved their social adaption capability (SAC) and quality of life. MethodsInpatient preschool children with malignant tumors admitted to the hospital between December 2009 and March 2012 were recruited and randomized into either the experimental or control groups. The control group received routine nursing care, and the experimental group received family-centered nursing care, including physical, psychological, and social interventions. The Infants-Junior Middle School Student's Social-Life Abilities Scale was used to evaluate SAC development of participants. ResultsParticipants (n?=?240) were recruited and randomized into two groups. After the intervention, the excellent and normal SAC rates were 27.5% and 55% in the experimental group, respectively, compared with 2.5% and 32.5% in the control group (p?<?0.001). After the intervention, SAC in experimental group was improved compared with before intervention (54.68?±?10.85 vs 79.9?±?22.3, p?<?0.001). However, no differences in SAC were observed between baseline and after intervention in the control group (54.70?±?11.47 vs. 52?±?15.8, p?=?0.38). ConclusionThe family-centered nursing care model that included physical, psychological, and social interventions improved the SAC of children with malignancies compared with children receiving routine nursing care. Establishing a standardized family?school?community?hospital hierarchical multi-management intervention model for children is important to the efficacy of long-term interventions and to the improvement of SAC of children with malignancies.

AB  - A cost effective, simple, portable hyperbaric chamber was constructed from polyvinyl chloride to aid in the collection of adult rockfishes Sebastes sp. to hold as broodstock. This system was designed to recompress fishes quickly once brought to the surface on hook and line, and to allow for decompression over a period of days. The hyperbaric chamber is capable of continuous stable operation at <1 033 515 N m?2 and can accommodate fishes up to 91·4 cm in length and 26·8 cm in diameter. Pressure in the chamber is maintained by a Goulds Booster pump that delivers continuous pressure and supplies sea water at a rate of 3·8 to 7·6 l min?1 to as many as four chambers. The hyperbaric chamber operated very effectively and allowed successful decompression of 12 cowcod Sebastes levis captured at depths of 90·2 to 146·3 m.

AB  - Abstract Background Until now, nonivamide/nicoboxil ointment has not been tested in a randomized trial for the treatment of acute non-specific low back pain. Methods This phase III randomized, double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial investigated efficacy, safety and tolerability of topical nicoboxil 2.5%/nonivamide 0.4% for treatment of acute non-specific low back pain [primary endpoint: pain intensity (PI) difference between pre-dose baseline and 8 h after the first application]. Results Patients (n = 805), 18?74 years of age were treated for up to 4 days with nicoboxil 2.5%/nonivamide 0.4%, nicoboxil 2.5%, nonivamide 0.4% or placebo ointment. Pre-dose baseline pain intensity (6.6 on a 0- to 10-point numerical rating scale) was reduced by 1.049 points with placebo, by 1.428 points with nicoboxil, by 2.252 points with nonivamide and by 2.410 points with nicoboxil/nonivamide after 8 h (p < 0.0001 for nicoboxil/nonivamide vs. placebo, nicoboxil; p = 0.4171 for nicoboxil/nonivamide vs. nonivamide). At the end of treatment, the combination provided more pronounced PI reduction (3.540 points) compared with nicoboxil (2.371, p < 0.0001), nonivamide (3.074, p = 0.0259) and placebo (1.884, p < 0.0001). Low back mobility scores on Day 1 were better for the combination compared with all other treatments (p < 0.044); on Day 2?4, scores were better than for placebo and nicoboxil (p < 0.003). Patients assessed efficacy of the combination as greater than of the comparators (p ≤ 0.0129). All treatments were tolerated well. No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported. Conclusion Nicoboxil/nonivamide ointment is an effective, well-tolerated medication for the treatment of acute non-specific low back pain.

AB  - Burn injury results in immunosuppression; previous work implicated a combination of altered T lymphocyte subpopulations and the elaboration of macrophage-derived mediators. However, the conclusions were based on T cell stimulations in the setting of high-dose polyclonal mitogenic stimuli and a single kinetic time-point. In this study, splenocytes from burned animals were used to examine lymphocyte responses over a multi-day time course following saturating and subsaturating anti-CD3, as well as mixed lymphocyte response (MLR) stimulation. Burn injury resulted in suppressed splenocyte-proliferative responses to high-dose anti-CD3 (2 ?g/ml) at all culture time-points (Days 2?5); this inhibition was eliminated by removing macrophages from the splenocyte cultures, by blocking NO production, or by using splenocytes from burned animals congenitally deficient in IFN-? (IFN-??/?). The results are consistent with immunosuppression attributable to burn-induced IFN-? production, which in turn, drives macrophage NO synthesis (NOS). In MLR cultures, lymphocyte proliferation and IFN-? production were depressed at later time-points (Days 3?5). APC from burned animals showed no defects as MLR stimulators; T cells from burned animals showed defective, proliferative responses, regardless of the stimulator population. Removing macrophages, adding a NOS inhibitor, or using IFN-??/? splenocytes did not restore the MLR response of burned splenocytes. T cells from burned IFN-??/? animals also showed depressed proliferation with subsaturating levels of anti-CD3 (0.1 ?g/ml); anti-CD-28 augmented the proliferative response. We conclude that burn-induced immunosuppression to authentic antigenic stimulation is related at least in part to defective CD3 signaling pathways and not simply to increased IFN-? or NO production.

AB  - Summary Horses worldwide are exposed to a complex mixture of intestinal parasitic helminths. When burdens are high, these parasites can seriously compromise health and welfare. Some helminth species have an extremely high prevalence and are difficult to control, not least because there is a limited understanding of their most basic biology. Furthermore, levels of resistance to some of the commonly used anthelmintics are widespread and increasing. The cyathostomins are the most common nematode species affecting equids worldwide. Within this group of parasites are more than 50 different species. Until recent research activities, little was known about the contribution that individual species make to clinical disease, parasite epidemiology and anthelmintic resistance. This review describes some of the recent research advances in the understanding of cyathostomins in these areas. As part of the research effort, molecular tools were developed to facilitate identification of the non-parasitic stages of cyathostomins. These tools have proved invaluable in the investigation of the relative contributions that individual species make to the pathology and epidemiology of mixed infections. At the more applied level, research has also progressed in the development of a diagnostic test that will allow numbers of cyathostomin encysted larvae to be estimated. This test utilises cyathostomin-specific serum antibody responses as markers of infection. As anthelmintic resistance will be the major constraint on parasite control in future, researchers are actively investigating mechanisms of drug resistance and how to improve the detection of resistance in the field. Recent developments in these areas are also outlined.

AB  - The detailed ontogeny of postgenital fusions within the gynoecium of Catharanthus roseus was investigated. The basal margins of the young carpel primordia infold and fuse together to seal shut the loculi. Independently, the opposing distal tips of the two carpels also unite, with the fusion region subsequently developing into the stigma, style, and a small distal region of the compound ovary. The basal ovary regions of the two opposing carpels remain unfused, thus leaving the tip fusion spatially restricted. In the region of contact, cells with distinctively epidermal features progressively lose their epidermal character after their participation in the fusion. In the fused stigma these former epidermal cells redifferentiate into transmitting and secretory tissues; in the fused style these cells undergo a tremendous expansion in length while forming stylar transmitting tissue; but in the compound ovary region corresponding cells experience little expansion or redifferentiation. It is concluded that the loss of epidermal features or the occurrence of periclinal cell divisions in the epidermis is a definitive indication that cells have fused postgenitally. However, studies with the transmission electron microscope are necessary to detect the first indications of a postgenital fusion. The compound ovary region within the gynoecium of C. roseus is a tissue appropriate for a high resolution ultrastructural study of the cytological events accompanying postgential tissue fusion because the fusion occurs quickly and little subsequent cell expansion takes place within this region.

AB  - Abstract Background/purpose During the injection of a fluid in a tissue model, the fluid might be affected by the needle tip configuration and the number of channels. Thus, the objective of the present work is to observe the influence of different needle tips and number of channels on the spread of a fluid. Methods Fluid distribution data were obtained after injecting 0.3 mL of fluid into a foamed polymer model with a velocity of 2 mm/s. The spread area and the depth were determined for 3 different types of hypodermic needles: Single channel needles with bevel tip and blunt tip and a needle with conical tip and 3 internal channels. Results The bevel tip provides a higher spread in the direction where the bevel points and reaches larger depths than the other two needles. The spread for the blunt tip and the polymer needle is equally distributed on both sides of the needle. The largest horizontal area around the tip is achieved by the 3-channel needle. Conclusion The tip configuration and number of channels have an influence on the distribution of fluid. The bevelled needle directs the fluid and reaches larger depths compared with the 3-channel needle that gets more horizontal spread.

AB  - Summary Functional abdominal pain (FAP) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have been associated with genetic, environmental, gastrointestinal, and psychosocial factors. The overall approach to FAP and IBS should be multi-;faceted and customized to address the patient's specific symptoms and underlying triggers. Cognitive behavioral therapy specifically targets the interplay between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and has been shown to be effective in reducing complaints of abdominal pain and helping patients cope with symptoms. Although the focus of many CBT sessions is on teaching the patient specific skills and strategies, parents are also frequently included in treatment to provide instruction in how to best assist and respond to the patient when he or she is experiencing pain. Continued research is necessary in order to better understand which aspects of CBT are most helpful. Additional studies are needed to confirm or dismiss the effectiveness of interventions such as school reintegration plans and parental/caregiver involvement in strategies such as gradual exposure to situations that may exacerbate pain, as well as re-involvement in previously enjoyed activities.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine changes in urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin concentration (uNGAL) in anaesthetized Greyhound dogs that developed acute tubular damage following haemorrhage and resuscitation with colloid-based fluids. Study design Prospective experimental study. Animals Seven healthy adult entire male Greyhound dogs. Methods During isoflurane anaesthesia, approximately 50 mL kg?1 of blood was removed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≤40 mmHg for 1 hour followed by gelatin-based colloid administration to maintain MAP ≥60 mmHg for 3 hours. Data, including oxygen extraction ratio and uNGAL, were collected before (T0) and immediately following (T1) haemorrhage, and hourly during reperfusion (T2?T4). After T4, dogs were euthanized and renal tissue was collected for histology. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated-measures one-way anova. Data are presented as means (95% confidence interval). Results Histology identified renal tubular epithelial damage in all dogs. Urine NGAL concentration increased from 12.1 (0?30.6) ng mL?1 at T0 to 122.0 (64.1?180.0) ng mL?1 by T3. Compared with T0, uNGAL was significantly higher at T3 (p = 0.016) and was increased 24-fold. Conclusions and clinical relevance Despite wide individual variation in baseline uNGAL, increases in uNGAL were observed in all dogs, suggesting that this biomarker has the potential to detect renal tubular injury following haemorrhage-induced hypotension and colloid-mediated reperfusion.

AB  - Cortical spreading depression (CSD) was induced by transient (10 min) applications of KCl in agar upon the cortical surface of α-chloralose anaesthetised cats. Its features were compared with CSD resulting from sustained applications of crystalline KCl through a mapping of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) using diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging (DWI) over a poststimulus period of 60?100 min. Individual CSD events were computationally detected with the aid of Savitzky-Golay smoothing applied to critically sampled data derived from regions of interest (ROIs) made up of 2 ? 2 pixel matrices. The latter were consistently placed at three selected sites on the suprasylvian gyrus (SG) and six sites on the marginal gyrus (MG). The CSD events thus detected were then quantitatively characterised for each ROI using the original time series. Both stimuli consistently elicited similar spreading patterns of initial, primary CSD events that propagated over the SG and marginal MG and were restricted to the hemispheres on which the stimuli were applied. There followed secondary events over smaller extents of cortical surface. Sustained stimuli elicited primary and secondary CSD events with similar amplitudes of ADC deflection that were distributed around a single mean. The ADC deflections were also conserved in peak amplitude throughout the course of their propagation. The initial primary event showed a poststimulus latency of 1.1 ± 0.1 min. Successive secondary events followed at longer, but uniform, time intervals of around 10 min. Primary and secondary CSDs showed significantly different velocities of conduction (3.32 ± 0.43 mm min?1vs. 2.11 ± 0.21 mm min?1, respectively; n= 5) across the cerebral hemisphere. In contrast, transient stimuli produced significantly fewer numbers of CSD events (3.8 ± 0.5 events per animal, n= 5) than did sustained stimuli (7.4 ± 0.5 events per animal, mean ±s.e.m., n= 5, P= 0.002). The peak ADC deflection of their primary CSD events declined by ≈30 % as they propagated from their initiation site to the interhemispheric boundary. The primary CSD event following a transient stimulus showed a latency of 1.4 ± 0.1 min. It was followed by successive and smaller secondary ADC deflections that were separated by progressively longer time intervals. Conduction velocities of secondary events were similar to those of primary events. Conduction velocities of both primary and secondary events were slower than their counterparts following a sustained stimulus. ADC changes associated with CSD thus persist at times well after stimulus withdrawal and vary markedly with the nature of the initiating stimulus even in brain regions remote from the stimulus site.

AB  - The respiratory centre is a multi-input system and positive-pressure ventilation is known to interfere with respiratory control mechanisms. Further, in intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV) the ventilatory pattern produced by the ventilator and the lung systems is known to influence pulmonary and cardiovascular functions. High-frequency positive-pressure ventilation (HFPPV) has been shown to eliminate respiration-synchronous variations in blood pressure and blood flow, and at frequencies of 60 per min or more spontaneous breathing ceases almost instantaneously if adequate alveolar ventilation and arterial oxygenation are achieved. However, activation of other inputs to the respiratory centre, e.g. chemo-receptor inputs, can induce spontaneous respiration during HFPPV. Consequently the balance between excitatory and inhibitory afferents is decisive for the patient's spontaneous respiratory efforts (discoordination) during artificial ventilation. The balance between excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms during artificial ventilation is illustrated in two patients with pulmonary insufficiency. Both patients exhibited spontaneous respiratory efforts (discoordination) during ventilation with a ?conventional? type of respirator (ventilatory frequency 20 per min) despite adequate alveolar ventilation, adequate arterial oxygenation and administration of sedatives and respiratory depressants. During HFPPV, at ventilatory frequencies of 60 per min or more, there was an inhibitory effect on spontaneous respiration, and with adequate alveolar ventilation and adequate arterial oxygenation (obtained at lower inspiratory airway pressures than with a ?conventional? type of ventilation) it was possible to discontinue sedatives and respiratory depressants without discoordination occurring between the patient and the ventilator. However, in one of the patients, with decreasing pulmonary compliance and diminishing arterial oxygenation (due to increasing intrapulmonary shunting and cardiac decompensation), spontaneous respiratory efforts were present despite high ventilatory frequencies and administration of sedatives and respiratory depressants. From experimental investigations reported elsewhere, this study in two patients and similar experience in other patients, it seems that it is easier to adapt a patient to a ventilator which has a negligible compression volume and which is set at a high frequency.

AB  - Summary Equine proliferative enteropathy (EPE) is a disease of foals caused by the obligate intracellular organism Lawsonia intracellularis. This emerging disease affects mainly weanling foals and causes fever, lethargy, peripheral oedema, diarrhoea, colic and weight loss. The diagnosis of EPE may be challenging and relies on the presence of hypoproteinaemia, thickening of segments of the small intestinal wall observed upon abdominal ultrasonography, positive serology and molecular detection of L.?intracellularis in faeces. Although the clinical entity, diagnostic approach and treatment of EPE are well established and described, the epidemiology for this disease has remained largely unaddressed. This article focuses on new developments in the field of EPE, including epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical signs, diagnosis, treatment and prevention. The Summary is available in Chinese ? see Supporting information.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study This is the first study comparing stemness features of equine mesenchymal progenitor cells derived from amniotic membrane and bone marrow. Objectives To investigate an alternative and noninvasive stromal cell source for equine tissue engineering. Study design In vitro experimental study of the characteristics of equine mesenchymal progenitor cells derived from amnion and bone marrow. Methods Cells isolated from amniotic membrane and bone marrow were analysed for proliferation (growth curve, doubling time, colony forming unit). Immunocytochemical detection of pluripotency markers and gene expression of stromal cell markers were also performed and these cells were studied for multilineage plasticity. Results Amniotic stromal cells (AMSCs) and bone marrow mesenchymal cells (BM-MSCs) both exhibited mature stromal cell-specific gene expression and immunocytochemical properties, but showed substantial differences in their proliferative and differentiation potential. The mean doubling time for AMSCs was significantly lower (P<0.05) than that observed for BM-MSCs (1.17 ± 0.15 vs. 3.27 ± 0.19 days, respectively). Compared to AMSCs, BM-MSCs also demonstrated a significantly (P<0.05) lower clonogenic capability (one fibroblast-like colony forming unit from a mean of 590.15 cells seeded for BM-MSCs vs. 242.73 cells seeded for AMSCs). BM-MSCs did not differentiate into glial cells, and the osteogenic differentiation process was longer than for AMSCs. Conclusions and potential relevance The amniotic membrane could be a valuable source of MSCs to be used both for allogenic and/or autologous therapies. The noninvasive nature and low cost of collection, the rapid proliferation along with a greater differentiation potential and the ?off the shelf? preparation potential could make AMCs useful for cell therapy.

AB  - Summary Influenza and tetanus-specific antibodies of the IgG sub-isotypes are posively transferred to foals via colostrum and inhibit their response to inactivated influenza vaccines and tetanus toxoid. High titres of influenza antibodies of IgGa and IgGb subisotypes and tetanus antibodies of the IgGa, IgGb and IgG(T) subisotypes were detected in postsucking serum samples collected from foals born to mares that had received booster doses of multicomponent vaccines during the last 2 months of gestation. Thereafter, titres declined in an exponential manner but were still detectable in all foals at age 26 weeks, regardless of whether they had been vaccinated prior to age 26 weeks. Mean ± s.e. half-life of decline of influenza IgGa antibodies (27.0 ± 2.3 days) was significantly shorter than that of influenza IgGb antibodies (39.1 ± 2.7 days; P<0.005). Tetanus IgGa and IgGb antibodies declined with half-lives of 28.8 ± 3.0 and 34.8 ± 5.1 days, respectively. Titres of tetanus IgG(T) antibodies were substantially higher than those of influenza IgG(T) antibodies in postsucking samples and remained so through age 26 weeks, declining with a half-life of approximately 35 days. Postsucking titres of tetanus and influenza antibodies of the IgA isotype were low and declined rapidly to undetectable levels. Yearlings showed significant increases in titre of influenza IgGa, IgGb and IgG(T) subisotype antibodies but no increase in influenza IgA antibodies in response to 2 doses of multicomponent vaccines containing tetanus toxoid and inactivated influenza A-1 and A-2 antigens. Yearlings also showed strong tetanus IgGa, IgGb and IgG(T) subisotype responses to one dose of vaccine and a substantial further rise in titre in response to administration of a second dose 3 weeks later, but failed to show an increase in titre of tetanus IgA antibodies. The influenza and tetanus IgGa, IgGb and IgG(T) subisotype responses of 6-month-old foals to vaccination followed the same pattern as those shown by yearlings but titres were generally lower. In contrast, 3-month-old foals failed to show increases in titre of either influenza or tetanus IgG subisotypes in response to 2 doses of vaccine and generally needed 1?3 additional booster doses of vaccine to achieve titres similar to those achieved by yearlings after 2 doses. Based on the finding that maternal antibodies exert a significant inhibitory effect on the response of foals to tetanus toxoid and inactivated influenza antigens, it is recommended that primary immunisation of foals born to vaccinated mares should not commence before age 6 months.

AB  - Abstract Lipotoxicity involves a series of pathological cellular responses after exposure to elevated levels of fatty acids. This process may be detrimental to normal cellular homeostasis and cell viability. The present study shows that nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells (NGFDPC12) and rat cortical cells (RCC) exposed to high levels of palmitic acid (PA) exhibit significant lipotoxicity and death linked to an ?augmented state of cellular oxidative stress? (ASCOS). The ASCOS response includes generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), alterations in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and increase in the mRNA levels of key cell death/survival regulatory genes. The observed cell death was apoptotic based on nuclear morphology, caspase-3 activation, and cleavage of lamin B and PARP. Quantitative real-time PCR measurements showed that cells undergoing lipotoxicity exhibited an increase in the expression of the mRNAs encoding the cell death-associated proteins BNIP3 and FAS receptor. Cotreatment of NGFDPC12 and RCC cells undergoing lipotoxicity with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) significantly reduced cell death within the first 2 hr following the initial exposure to PA. The data suggest that lipotoxicity in NGFDPC12 and cortical neurons triggers a strong cell death apoptotic response. Results with NGFDPC12 cells suggest a linkage between induction of ASCOS and the apoptotic process and exhibit a temporal window that is sensitive to DHA and BSA interventions. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
