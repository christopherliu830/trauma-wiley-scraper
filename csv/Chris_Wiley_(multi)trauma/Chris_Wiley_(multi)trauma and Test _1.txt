AB  - Background Free-tissue transfer flaps are an effective reconstructive option for complex wounds; however, flap failure is a dreaded complication requiring timely re-exploration and salvage. The aim of this study was to determine whether salvage rates were higher in skin flaps, as opposed to muscle flaps, due to the durability of the overlying skin paddle allowing for better visual post-operative monitoring and more timely recognition of the threatened flap. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent a free flap at an Australian tertiary centre between 2004 and 2014. Data were collected on patient demographics, indication, flap type, time of recognition of the threatened flap and re-exploration outcome. Data were analysed using Stata version 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Student's t-test, analysis of variance and Pearson's chi-squared test were used to compare groups. Results There were 560 patients who underwent 573 free flaps. The most common indication was trauma. There were 58 re-explorations with a successful salvage rate of 79.3% (46/58). Overall complete flap loss rate was 2.1% (12/573). In flaps requiring re-exploration, there was a higher complete flap loss rate for muscle only flaps versus those with a skin paddle (P-value?=?0.041). Conclusion While timely recognition and re-exploration of the compromised free flap in the early postoperative setting is important in determining the flap salvage success, it is demonstrated that salvage rates are poorer for muscle only flaps compared with flaps with a skin paddle.

AB  - Abstract Scoring systems are used for mortality and morbidity rating in intensive care conditions, prognosis prediction, standardization of scientific data and the monitoring of clinical quality. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the efficacy of APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation), APACHE IV and SAPS (Simplified Acute Physiology Score) III prognostic scorings in the prediction of mortality and disease severity of patients admitted to the Anesthesia and Reanimation Clinic Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in Bak?rköy Dr. Sadi Konuk Training and Research Hospital according to general and specific diagnoses. A total of 1896 patient files were included in the study. With the exception of single system or head trauma patient groups, a statistically significant difference was found in the mortality prediction rates in all other diagnosis groups (P?<?0.05). The discrimination calculated with AUROC fields was sufficient in all groups, and calibration was evaluated as good except for the neurological and neurosurgical patient group. In respect of standard mortality prediction, APACHE II and IV were good in cases of sepsis, and SAPS III made almost exact predictions for cardiovascular diseases, APACHE II for neurological diseases, and APACHE IV for gastrointestinal system diseases. From the results of this study, it was seen that different scoring systems vary in predictions according to the diagnoses, therefore, it can be recommended that the diagnosis should be taken into account more when applying scoring systems.

AB  - This report describes a method to teach undergraduate students the knowledge base and skills needed to maximize the educational value of a subsequent cardiothoracic surgical clerkship. Sixty-three fourth year medical students underwent a structured teaching programme in which groups of five students rotated through a series of six teaching stations. Subject material, presented during 20 min at each station, covered the key issues relating to coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, chest trauma, lung cancer, prosthetic heart valves, pacemakers, thoracic sepsis and dysphagia. Group knowledge increased significantly (P < 0.001) from a mean mark of 23% (s.d. 12) in a pre-test to a mean mark of 46% (s.d. 12) in a test conducted 1 month after the teaching. The time taken to conduct the structured teaching/assessment was 5 h compared with 32 h to run the same programme by the traditional ward tutorial system. The dollar cost to stage the structured teaching was less than that to run the traditional tutorial programme. It was concluded that the teaching method is effective, economical and practical and that it has a role in an undergraduate curriculum to prepare students for clinical clerkship.

However, latest research shows that chest ultrasound has superior accuracy when compared to supine chest X ray for diagnosing most chest injuries. Is it time we allowed ultrasound to supersede supine chest X ray as the initial investigative modality of choice for the patient with thoracic trauma?

AB  - Objective To detail the 9-year experience of renal trauma at a modern Level 1 trauma centre and report on patterns of injury, management and complications. Patients and methods We analysed 338 patients with renal injuries who presented to our institution over a 9-year period. Data on demographics, clinical presentation, management and complications were recorded. Results Males comprised 74.9% of patients with renal injuries and the highest incidence was amongst those aged 20?24 years. Blunt injuries comprised 96.2% (n = 325) of all the renal injuries, with road trauma being the predominant mechanism accounting for 72.5% of injuries. The distribution of injury grade was; 21.6% grade 1 (n = 73), 24.3% grade 2 (n = 82), 24.9% grade 3 (n = 84), 16.6% grade 4 (n = 56), and 12.7% grade 5 (n = 43). Conservative management was successful in all grade 1 and 2 renal injuries, and 94.9%, 90.7% and 35.1% of grade 3, 4 and 5 injuries respectively. All but one of the 13 patients with penetrating injuries were successfully managed conservatively. Conclusions Road trauma is the greatest cause of renal injury. Most haemodynamically stable patients are successfully managed conservatively.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives This research was conducted with the aim of investigating the accuracy of the shock index (SI) in distinguishing which multiple-trauma patients should be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) after treatment in an emergency room (ER). Background The SI is an easily obtained indicator, as it corresponds to an arithmetic ratio between the two parameters that are always measured during the first-aid treatment of multiple-trauma patients: heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). There are many studies examining the SI in the multiple-trauma patients as a possible predictor of the destination unit. The SI is evaluated both at the trauma scene (pre-hospital SI-pH) and in the emergency room (SI-ER). Design and methods An observational study with a retrospective approach was conducted on 158 adult patients with multiple trauma. Results The mean SI-pH and SI-ER values were higher in ICU patients than in-patients discharged or admitted to a normal ward, but the difference between these two patient groups was significant only for the SI-ER. Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed that only the SI-ER is significant as a reliable indicator for ICU admission with a best cut-off of 1·05. However, a threshold value of 0·75 was still able to establish the correct type of destination for multiple-trauma patients, with a sensitivity of 57·3% and a specificity of 62·5%. Conclusions This research showed that the SI-pH and SI-ER values are correlated, but only the SI-ER has shown statistical significance in terms of distinguishing the type of destination of multiple-trauma patient (ICU, ordinary ward or discharge) after initial treatment in the ER. Relevance to clinical practice The results of this study suggest the possibility of using SI in multiple-trauma patients as a triage indicator to assess the patients' care complexity and to guide the choice of proper clinical paths.

AB  - Abstract Background The dramatic impact of hemosiderosis on survival in chronically transfused patients with hereditary anemia is well known. We evaluated whether patients receiving multiple red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are adequately screened for hemosiderosis. Methods We retrospectively assessed hemosiderosis screening and prevalence in adult patients that received over twenty RBC units in the University Medical Centre Utrecht from 2010 till 2015. Hemosiderosis was defined as ferritin ≥1000 ?g/L. Adequate screening for chronically transfused patients was defined as any ferritin determined up to 3 months before or any moment after the last transfusion, while for patients that received all transfusions within 3 months (bulk transfusion), ferritin had to be determined after at least twenty transfusions. Results Of 471 patients, only 38.6% was adequately screened and hemosiderosis prevalence was 46.7%. Hemosiderosis prevalence was 47% in the chronic transfusion group and 12% in the bulk transfusion group. In patients transfused because of hematological malignancy or cardiothoracic surgery, respectively, 74% and 31% were adequately screened and hemosiderosis prevalence was 53% and 13%, respectively. Conclusion Hemosiderosis screening in our routine practice is suboptimal. Hemosiderosis is not an exclusive complication of multiple transfusions in the hematology ward. We recommend screening for hemosiderosis in all patients receiving multiple transfusions.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background:? There is an increasing trend towards early mobilisation post-split skin grafting of the lower limbs. This study was performed to determine if early mobilisation impacts negatively on graft healing and patient morbidity. Methods:? A retrospective review of 48 cases of lower limb split skin grafts performed by the plastic surgery department at Royal Perth Hospital was undertaken. Patients were stratified into early and late mobilisation groups. Results:? No difference in outcome was identified with early mobilisation, but an increased rate of deconditioning with increased length of stay was present with late mobilisation. Conclusion:? These results suggest that early mobilisation post-split skin grafting of the lower limb is beneficial to patient care and is associated with lower morbidity.

This study aims to identify (i) the number of admissions because of falls from mango trees; (ii) epidemiology; (iii) seasonal trend; (iv) injury profile; and (v) hospital care provided. Methods:? Retrospective case review on all mango tree falls related injuries resulting in admissions at the Lautoka Hospital, Fiji during a 1-year period (2007). Patient records were analysed to identify specific injury patterns such as upper/lower limb fractures, spinal cord injury and head injury, caused by mango tree falls. Results:? Thirty-nine cases were identified. Eighty-two percent (n= 32) of the falls occurred in the mango season (June?November). Seventy-two percent (n= 28) of the patients were males and 28% (n= 11) were females. Seventy-six percent were aged 5?13 and only 21% were adults. Also, 77% (n= 30) of the patients were ethnic Fijians and 23% (n= 9) were Fijian-Indians. Sixty-four percent (n= 25) had closed fractures and 17% (n= 7) had open fractures. Fifty-six percent (n= 22) of the fractures were of the fore arm. There were two cases of spinal cord injury, four cases of head injury, one ICU admission and one death. Average hospital stay was 7.56 days. Conclusion:? All these injuries were recreational and the majority in the urban setting. They were all avoidable.

AB  - Abstract Objective The goal of the present study was to compare the diagnostic yield of weight-bearing radiographs with non-weight-bearing computed tomography (CT) scan for subtle Lisfranc (LF) injuries in the ED. Methods Retrospective analysis of patients presenting with a suspected LF injury over a 2 year period from 2016 to 2017 who had both weight-bearing bilateral foot radiographs and CT scan. Information extracted included patient demographics, radiographic findings of metatarsal fractures, fleck sign and measurements of diastasis between the medial cuneiform and second metatarsal expressed as a ratio of the uninjured side, clinical findings and treatment modality. Radiologist reports were recorded as either positive, negative or equivocal for a LF injury. Results A total of 117 patients were included with a mean age of 38?years and 54% (n?=?63) women. When initial weight-bearing radiographs were positive, 54% of subsequent CT scans were reported as either equivocal or negative. Of the patients who had a negative or equivocal weight-bearing radiograph, only 12% had a positive CT scan. The mean diastasis ratio in patients undergoing surgery was 1.53 (95% confidence interval 1.41?1.65) compared to 1.11 (95% confidence interval 1.07?1.16) for patients with injuries not requiring operative intervention (P?<?0.001). There was a statistically significant correlation between a positive weight-bearing radiograph and surgical treatment (R?=?0.339, P?<?0.001), and between diastasis measurements and surgical treatment (R?=?0.576, P?<?0.001). Conclusions CT provides limited benefit in the diagnosis and initial management of suspected subtle LF injuries in the ED. We advocate for the use of bilateral weight-bearing radiographs as a first-line investigation.

AB  - Abstract. In order to define patients at high risk for inappropriate antibiotic treatment of bacteraemia, we compared 682 bacteraemic patients, treated with an antibiotic drug to which the infecting micro-organism was susceptible, with 419 patients who were inappropriately treated. On a multivariate logistic regression analysis including only clinical variables, four factors were found to be both significantly and independently associated with inappropriate antibiotic treatment: hospital-acquired bacteraemia (oddsratio (OR) of 1.9), antibiotic treatment in the month prior to the bacteraemia (OR 1.9), residence in a nursing home (OR 1.8), and the presence of a central line (OR 1.7). A second model, including bacteriological data, showed four micro-organisms to be independently associated with inappropriate antibiotic treatment: Candida sp. (OR 14.2), Acinetobacter sp. (OR 5.0), Enterococcus sp. (OR 3.6) and Pseudomonas sp. (OR 2.2). In this model, only two clinical features were included: hospital-acquired infection and previous antibiotic treatment. Special efforts should be made to improve empirical antibiotic treatment in the groups defined above, and to facilitate early laboratory diagnosis of the micro-organisms associated with inappropriate treatment.

AB  - Summary We conducted a prospective study of non-cardiac surgical patients aged 70?years or more in 23 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. We studied 4158 consecutive patients of whom 2845 (68%) had pre-existing comorbidities. By day 30, 216 (5%) patients had died, and 835 (20%) suffered complications; 390 (9.4%) patients were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. Pre-operative factors associated with mortality included: increasing age (80?89?years: OR 2.1 (95% CI 1.6?2.8), p?<?0.001; 90+?years: OR 4.0 (95% CI 2.6?6.2), p?<?0.001); worsening ASA physical status (ASA 3: OR 3.1 (95% CI 1.8?5.5), p?<?0.001; ASA 4: OR 12.4 (95% CI 6.9?22.2), p?<?0.001); a pre-operative plasma albumin <?30?g.l?1 (OR: 2.5 (95% CI 1.8?3.5), p?<?0.001); and non-scheduled surgery (OR 1.8 (95% CI 1.3?2.5), p?<?0.001). Complications associated with mortality included: acute renal impairment (OR 3.3 (95% CI 2.1?5.0), p?<?0.001); unplanned Intensive Care Unit admission (OR 3.1 (95% CI 1.9?4.9), p?<?0.001); and systemic inflammation (OR 2.5 (95% CI 1.7?3.7), p?<?0.001). Patient factors often had a stronger association with mortality than the type of surgery. Strategies are needed to reduce complications and mortality in older surgical patients.

AB  - Background Previous studies have shown that children with isolated linear skull fractures have excellent clinical outcomes and low risk of surgery. We wish to identify other injury patterns within the spectrum of paediatric mild head injury, which need only conservative management. Children with low risk of evolving neurosurgical lesions could be safely managed in primary hospitals. Methods We retrospectively analysed all children with mild head injury (i.e. admission Glasgow coma score 13?15) and skull fracture or haematoma on a head computed tomography scan admitted to Westmead Children's Hospital, Sydney over the years 2009?2014. Data were collected regarding demographics, clinical findings, mechanism of injury, head computed tomography scan findings, neurosurgical intervention, outcome and length of admission. Wilcoxon paired test was used with P value <0.05 considered significant. Results Four hundred and ten children were analysed. Three hundred and eighty-one (93%) children were managed conservatively, 18 (4%) underwent evacuation of extradural haematoma (TBI surgery) and 11 (3%) needed fracture repair surgery. Two children evolved a surgical lesion 24 h post-admission. Only 17 of 214 children transferred from peripheral hospitals needed neurosurgery. Overall outcomes: zero deaths, one needed brain injury rehabilitation and 63 needed child protection unit intervention. Seventy-five percentage of children with non-surgical lesions were discharged within 2 days. Eighty-three percentage of road transfers were discharged within 3 days. Conclusions Children with small intracranial haematomas and/or skull fractures who need no surgery only require brief inpatient symptomatic treatment and could be safely managed in primary hospitals. Improved tertiary hospital transfer guidelines with protocols to manage clinical deterioration could have cost benefit without risking patient safety.

AB  - Background: The aim of the present study was to determine those factors which contribute to a poor outcome and to propose a management plan that is complementary to trauma systems in common use. Methods: A prospective study of 110 consecutive patients with moderate head injury (post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 9?13) was carried out. Results: A total of 75% of the patients sustained multisystem trauma, generally of minor or moderate grade according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). However, the death rate increased with the severity of the injury as measured by the Injury Severity Score (ISS). The initial cranial computed tomography (CT) scan was abnormal in 61% and no patient with a normal scan developed a delayed intracranial haematoma or neurological worsening. Those patients who developed a delayed intracerebral haematoma had a worse outcome. Sixteen patients underwent craniotomy for haematoma. The intracranial pressure (ICP) was measured selectively in 20 patients and exceeded 20 mmHg in half, requiring treatment. Nine patients died, four as a result of head injury and all those had an intracranial haematoma. As a group, those who died were older and had a higher ISS. Conclusions: A plan for care of patients with moderate head injury is proposed, complementary to the Early Management of Severe Trauma (EMST) protocol and the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia guidelines for neurotrauma management in rural and remote locations.

AB  - Success in competing for research funding, acceptance of an abstract, or publication of a manuscript depends in part on the ability to communicate in writing the essence of one's research. The research grant, abstract, and manuscript represent the three primary phases of formally communicating research from planning to dissemination of results. In this paper, perspectives on avoiding the common pitfalls of research writing in terms of content, style, and format are presented to facilitate a successful outcome.

AB  - Summary We proposed that many Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients would be hypothermic in the early postoperative period and that hypothermia would be associated with increased mortality. We retrospectively reviewed patients admitted to ICU after surgery. We recorded the lowest temperature in the first 24?h after surgery using tympanic membrane thermometers. We defined hypothermia as <?36?°C, and severe hypothermia as <?35?°C. We studied 5050 consecutive patients: 35% were hypothermic and 6% were severely hypothermic. In-hospital mortality was 5.6% for normothermic patients, 8.9% for all hypothermic patients (p?<?0.001), and 14.7% for severely hypothermic patients (p?<?0.001). Hypothermia was associated with in-hospital mortality: OR 1.83 for each degree Celsius (°C) decrease (95% CI: 1.2?2.60, p?<?0.001). Given the evidence for improved outcome associated with active patient warming during surgery we suggest conducting prospective studies of active warming of patients admitted to ICU after surgery.

AB  - Background Trauma remains the most frequent cause of death for patients under 35 years of age. Head injury and catastrophic haemorrhage account for the majority of early deaths. A trauma laparotomy is often necessary to arrest haemorrhage. Methods All patients who died in Queensland hospitals between 2011 and 2016 having had a trauma laparotomy were identified from the Queensland Audit of Surgical Mortality. Results About 69.0% of the 84 deaths were male with a median age of 47.6 years. About 64.3% of deaths occurred within the first 2 days following trauma. Mechanism of injury was typically road traffic accident (77.4%). Sixteen patients underwent a non-therapeutic laparotomy. Following peer-review, different management was recommended for only three patients. Conclusion This group of patients who died in the setting of a trauma laparotomy received high quality trauma care. Ongoing education is needed as some non-therapeutic laparotomies may be avoidable.
