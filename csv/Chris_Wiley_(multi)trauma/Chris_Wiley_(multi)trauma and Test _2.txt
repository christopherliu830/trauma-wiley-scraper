AB  - Background:? The purpose of this study was to test whether focus groups involving medical students, house officers, senior doctors, and nurses could identify an undergraduate emergency medicine core curriculum. Method:? From May 2001 to January 2002, we interviewed 12 homogenous focus groups within all 88 participants. Three focus groups were composed of medical students; three of house officers, three of senior doctors, and three focus groups were composed of nurses. Each interview lasted 2?h. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using qualitative methods. Results:? The focus groups suggested and discussed in all 196 objectives. Students, physicians, and nurses agreed that newly graduated physicians should master history taking, 21 clinical disorders, 15 practical skills, interpretation of two diagnostic tests, two general diagnostic skills, and two leadership skills. Apart from these 43 core objectives, disagreement was substantial. Participants gave very different priorities to communication, knowledge about clinical disorders, practical clinical skills, leadership, and ?the art of medicine?. Conclusion:? In conclusion, focus groups could identify an emergency medicine core curriculum. However, participants had very different perspectives on the curriculum. Focus groups could be one very practicable part of seeking consensus on what is core and securing local roots and ownership to an undergraduate emergency medicine curriculum before and during implementation.

AB  - Abstract Background Many authors advocate lipase as the preferred serological test for the diagnosis of pancreatitis and a cut-off level of three or more times the upper limit of normal (ULN) is often quoted. The literature contains no systematic review that explores alternative causes of a lipase level over three times as high as the ULN. Such a review was therefore the objective of this study. Methods The EMBASE and MEDLINE databases (1985 to August 2013) were searched for all eligible articles. Predetermined data were extracted and independently analysed by two reviewers. Results In total, data from 58 studies were included in the final analysis. The following causes other than pancreatitis of lipase levels exceeding three times the ULN were found: reduced clearance of lipase caused by renal impairment or macrolipase formation; other hepatobiliary, gastroduodenal, intestinal and neoplastic causes; critical illness, including neurosurgical pathology; alternative pancreatic diagnoses, such as non-pathological pancreatic hyperenzymaemia, and miscellaneous causes such as diabetes, drugs and infections. Conclusions A series of differential diagnoses for significant serum lipase elevations (i.e. exceeding three times the ULN) has been provided by this study. Clinicians should utilize this knowledge in the interpretation and management of patients who have lipase levels over three times as high as the ULN, remaining vigilant for an alternative diagnosis to pancreatitis. The medical officer should be aware of the possibility of incorrect diagnosis in the asymptomatic patient.

AB  - Aim To determine whether the placement of a post-pyloric feeding tube (PPFT) can be taught safely and effectively to a critical care dietitian. Methods This is a prospective observational study conducted in an adult intensive care unit (ICU). The intervention consisted of 19 attempts at post-pyloric intubation by the dietitian. The 10 ?learning? attempts were performed by the dietitian under the direction of an experienced (having completed in excess of 50 successful tube placements) user. A subsequent nine ?consolidation? attempts were performed under the responsibility of the intensive care consultant on duty. The primary outcome measures were success (i.e. tip of the PPFT being visible in or distal to the duodenum on X-ray) and time (minutes) to PPFT placement. Patients were observed for adverse events per standard clinical practice. Results A total of 19 post-pyloric tube placements were attempted in 18 patients (52 (23?70) years, ICU admission diagnoses: trauma n = 4; respiratory failure n = 3; and burns, pancreatitis and renal failure n = 2 each). No adverse events occurred. Most (75%) patients were sedated, and mechanically ventilated. Prokinetics were used to assist tube placement in 11% (2/19) of attempts, both of which were successful. Placement of PPFT was successful in 58% (11/19) of attempts. Whilst training, the success rate was 40% (4/10) compared with 78% (7/9) once training was consolidated (P = 0.17). In the successful attempts, the mean time to placement was 11.0 minutes (3.9?27.1 minutes). Conclusions A dietitian can be trained to safely and successfully place PPFT in critically ill patients.

AB  - Abstract Background The rate of hospitalization in elderly patients because of falls is increasing. The objective of this study was to investigate long-term trends in injury profiles of low-energy falls and to identify injuries associated with need for in-patient rehabilitation. Methods A single-centre retrospective study was performed at an inner city Major Trauma Centre in Sydney. Trauma registry data were obtained from patients who were 65 years of age or over with low-energy falls (trip and fall from height ≤1?m, including falls from standing) from the trauma registry between January 2000 and December 2011. Demographic data, time and date of presentation and injury characteristics were collected. Outcomes of interests were proportions of hip fractures, head injuries and discharge to in-patient rehabilitation facilities. Results A total of 4964 cases were identified. There was a 6.5% per annum decrease in the proportion of elderly patients with low-energy falls who sustained hip fractures compared with a relative increase in severe head injuries, 5.7% per annum. Around 25% of patients were transferred to in-patient rehabilitation. Severe head injuries and lower-limb injuries were the two injuries most associated with transfer to in-patient rehabilitation. Conclusion In elderly patients with low-energy falls, a significant decrease in hip fractures was associated with a rise in severe head injuries over the past decade.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To review emergency sedation intubation as practised in the Melbourne-based ambulance helicopter. Specifically, to describe patient profiles, drug dosage, difficulties encountered, success rate and patient outcomes. Methods: Retrospective review of all helicopter primary and secondary retrieval patients, who received application of the emergency sedation intubation protocol using morphine and diazepam during a 3 year period (January 1995 to December 1997). Data were collected from an audit of patient care records completed by flight paramedics and from hospital records. Results: Emergency sedation intubation was performed on 128 patients: 103 adults and 25 children. The median dose of drugs required for emergency sedation intubation by adult patients was 20 mg morphine and 20 mg diazepam. The overall success rate for emergency sedation intubation was 94.5%, with 73.6% of these being successful intubations at the first attempt. On intubation, 54.1% of patients were fully relaxed, while a gag reflex was still present in 45.9% of patients during or just after emergency sedation intubation. Twenty-two per cent of patients had a change in blood pressure of more than 20 mmHg. The maximum rise in blood pressure was 60 mmHg and the maximum fall was 80 mmHg. Conclusions: Flight paramedics achieved a high success rate for intubation with the morphine/ diazepam emergency sedation intubation protocol. However, there was still a significant percentage of patients for whom more than one attempt was required to achieve emergency sedation intubation and, in almost half the patients, gag reflexes remained present either during or immediately after intubation. Additionally, some patients experienced blood pressure changes following intubation that may have potential adverse consequences in terms of compromised cerebral perfusion or rises in intracranial pressure. Consideration should be given to revision of the protocol to allow the use of neuromuscular blocking agents and alternative airway management techniques, such as cricothyroidotomy, for specified circumstances in the aeromedical environment.

AB  - Abstract Objective:? To describe and identify the relationship between ED length of stay (LOS) and mortality after ICU admission. Methods:? We undertook a retrospective cohort study of records from the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database (from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2006). Data from 45 hospitals and 48?803 ED patients directly transferred to ICU were included. Patients were divided into ED LOS < 8?h and ED LOS ≥ 8?h. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Results:? Median ED LOS was 3.9?h (interquartile range 2.0?6.8). Patients transferred within 8?h (80.9%) were younger (P < 0.001) and more seriously ill (higher mortality and mechanical ventilation rate) than those transferred ≥8?h. There was no clear relationship between ED LOS and hospital survival for patients admitted directly to ICU (odds ratio = 1.01 per hour, 95% confidence intervals 0.99?1.02). Conclusion:? Although 20% of critically ill patients spend more than 8?h in ED before transfer to ICU, we were unable to demonstrate an adverse relationship between time in ED and hospital mortality.

AB  - Abstract: Blunt abdominal trauma is the commonest cause of intra-abdominal injuries in children. The use of computerized axial tomography and non-operative management of haemoperitoneum are two significant developments in the last two decades in the management of blunt abdominal trauma in children. The concept of non-operative management was introduced in late 1979 and wherever possible remains the optimum treatment. Computerized tomography scan for paediatric abdominal trauma was first described in 1980 and remains the investigation of choice. There is no substitute, however, for a good history, astute physical examination, and strict adherence to the principles of primary and secondary survey, prompt resuscitation, vigilant monitoring and repeated evaluation.

AB  - Background In health, the hormones amylin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) slow gastric emptying (GE) and modulate glycaemia. The aims of this study were to determine amylin and GLP-1 concentrations in the critically ill and their relationship with GE, glucose absorption and glycaemia. Methods In fasted critically ill and healthy subjects (n?=?26 and 23 respectively), liquid nutrient, containing 100?mg 13C-sodium octanoate and 3?g 3-O-methlyglucose (3-OMG), was administered via a nasogastric tube. Amylin, GLP-1, glucose and 3-OMG concentrations were measured in blood samples taken during fasting, and 30 min and 60?min after the ?meal?. Breath samples were taken to determine gastric emptying coefficient (GEC). Intolerance to intragastric feeding was defined as a gastric residual volume of ≥?250?ml and/or vomiting within the 24?h prior to the study. Results Although GE was slower (GEC: critically ill 2.8?±?0.9 vs. health, 3.4?±?0.2; P?=?0.002), fasting blood glucose was higher (7.0?±?1.9 vs. 5.7?±?0.2?mmol/l; P?=?0.005) and overall glucose absorption was reduced in critically ill patients (3-OMG: 9.4?±?8.0 vs. 17.7?±?4.9?mmol/l.60?min; P?<?0.001), there were no differences in fasting or postprandial amylin concentrations. Furthermore, although fasting [1.7 (0.4?7.2) vs. 0.7 (0.3?32.0)?pmol/l; P?=?0.04] and postprandial [3.0 (0.4?8.5) vs. 0.8 (0.4?34.3)?pmol/l; P?=?0.02] GLP-1 concentrations were increased in the critically ill and were greater in feed intolerant when compared with those tolerating feed [3.7 (0.4?7.2) vs. 1.2 (0.7?4.6)?pmol/l; P?=?0.02], there were no relationships between GE and fasting amylin or GLP-1 concentrations. Conclusion In the critically ill, fasting GLP-1, but not amylin, concentrations are elevated and associated with feed intolerance. Neither amylin nor GLP-1 appears to substantially influence the rate of GE.

AB  - Abstract Objective Fluid bolus therapy (FBT) is recommended as the initial form of acute circulatory support for many disease processes. The epidemiology of its use in the ED is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess indications, use patterns and short-term effects of FBT in a paediatric ED. Methods Retrospective observational study in the ED of the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia (annual census >90?000) using hospital electronic medical record data for all patients who received an i.v. fluid bolus in the ED over the calendar year 2018 were included in the study. We extracted demographics, indications, volume, content of FBT as well as subsequent vital sign and biochemical changes. Results One thousand five hundred and thirty-nine fluid boluses were administered to 1343/90?000 children (1.5%), 1185 received 1, 123 received 2, 32 received 3, and 3 received 4 boluses. Fluid bolus volume of 10 mL/kg was used in 45.3%, 20?mL/kg in 35.7%, 500?mL in 6.4% and 1000?mL in 7.1%. The fluid content was 0.9% saline in 99.9% of cases. The most common indications for FBT were: vomiting/diarrhoea (23%), acute febrile illness (11%) and pneumonia or sepsis (10% each). FBT was associated with a reduction in median heart rate by 6 beats per minute (P?<?0.01), reduction in mean blood pressure by 3?mmHg (P?<?0.01), and reduction in venous lactate by 0.2?mmol/L (P?<?0.01). Conclusions Fluid bolus therapy is a commonly used intervention in the paediatric ED, most often for dehydration. Variability in indications, dose and effects of FBT warrant further exploration.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this report was to review retrospectively the management of splenic trauma at a major Australian tertiary referral centre (Westmead Hospital) over a 10 year period. Forty-nine patients (0-15 years of age) with documented blunt splenic trauma were identified. The causes of splenic injury were road trauma (73%) and falls (27%). There were 22 minor injuries (Injury severity score [ISS] <16) and 27 severe injuries (ISS ≥16). All nine deaths were related to road trauma (mean ISS = 59). The investigation most commonly used was CT scanning (47%). Peritoneal lavage was performed in six patients (12%). Management involved non-operative care in 29 patients (57%), exploratory laparotomy alone in 5 (10%), splenic salvage in 2 (4%) and splenectomy in 13 (26%). This experience supports the view that non-operative management of splenic injury in haemodynamically stable children is safe and is the preferred treatment. Experienced assessment and meticulous observation is necessary. Laparotomy is indicated if there is continuing haemodynamic instability despite resuscitation. Operative management is aimed at splenic salvage with splenectomy being reserved for uncontrolled haemorrhage.

AB  - Background Lipase is both a sensitive and specific marker for diagnosing pancreatitis. However, the benefit of serial lipase in both monitoring and defining prognosis remains undetermined. This systematic review was conducted to further evaluate this potential application. In addition, this review also looked into the benefits of serial lipase in the subgroup of traumatic pancreatitis. Methods PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were systematically searched for related articles, between January 1995 and December 2015, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses standards. Data was extracted and analysed by two authors. Results Seven studies were included in the final analysis: six retrospective and one prospective studies were identified. Five studies (all retrospective) concluded no benefits in serial lipase for prognostication, while two studies identified serial lipase as a beneficial prognostic factor for acute pancreatitis. Of the included studies, only two involved traumatic pancreatitis (both dedicated to the paediatric population). Conclusion The evidence supporting or opposing serial lipase as a prognostic factor for pancreatitis is weak and consists mainly of retrospective analyses. The only prospective data identified suggested benefits to serial lipase in prognosis. Further prospective studies evaluating the prognostic value of serial lipase in the adult population with both traumatic and non-traumatic pancreatitis are required given the paucity of available evidence.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? Victoria's new trauma care system has been followed by reductions in preventable and potentially preventable deaths and in deficiencies contributing to death. This improvement has followed triaging more patients to expanded major trauma services where mortality was already lower rather than to improved results within the major trauma services, metropolitan or rural trauma services or ambulance services, Victoria. The objective of the present study was to identify continuing inadequacies within the individual trauma services and in association with representatives of these services to develop appropriate countermeasures. Methods:? Initially, presentations were made to each trauma service of their fatalities evaluated after introduction of the new trauma system. At separate working party meetings with each service consensus recommendations were finalized and these disseminated to stakeholders. Results:? Recommendations related to the need for Trauma Director/Coordinator appointments at all designated hospitals receiving major trauma, improved facilities and equipment, the trauma team, referral, communications, protocols, a prompting system, education, audit and feedback, infrastructure, staffing, documentation and inter-hospital patient transfer. Conclusion:? Interaction between the Consultative Committee on Road Traffic Fatalities and Victorian trauma services identified continuing deficiencies in the new trauma care system and developed consensus recommendations to target these problems. These require implementation through the State Trauma Committee.

AB  - Background The primary aim was to investigate the performance of a National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics based predictive model (NACA-BM) for mortality at 14 days and a reference model using motor GCS (GCS-RM). The secondary aim was to compare the models for impaired consciousness of survivors at 14 days (IC-14; GCS ≤ 13). Methods Patients ≥16 years having sustained TBI with an abbreviated injury scale score of head region (HAIS) of >3 were included. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to test models for death and IC-14. The discrimination was assessed using area under the receiver-operating curves (AUROCs); noninferiority margin was ?5% between the AUROCs. Calibration was assessed using the Hosmer Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Results Six hundred and seventy seven patients were included. The median age was 54 (IQR 32-71). The mortality rate was 31.6%; 99 of 438 surviving patients (22.6%) had an IC-14. Discrimination of mortality was 0.835 (95%CI 0.803-0.867) for the NACA-BM and 0.839 (0.807-0.872) for the GCS-RM; the difference of the discriminative ability was ?0.4% (?2.3% to +1.7%). Calibration was appropriate for the NACA-BM (?2 8.42; P = 0. 393) and for the GCS-RM (?2 3.90; P = 0. 866). Discrimination of IC-14 was 0.757 (0.706-0.808) for the NACA-BM and 0.784 (0.734-0.835) for the GCS-RM; the difference of the discriminative ability was ?2.5% (?7.8% to +2.6%). Calibration was appropriate for the NACA-BM (?2 10.61; P = 0.225) and for the GCS-RM (?2 6.26; P = 0.618). Conclusions Prehospital prediction of mortality after TBI was good with both models, and the NACA-BM was not inferior to the GCS-RM. Prediction of IC-14 was moderate in both models.

AB  - Objective Plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (pNGAL) has been introduced as an early and sensitive biomarker of acute kidney injury (AKI), with an increased risk for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and adverse outcome in selected critically ill patient groups. Acute respiratory failure is the most common organ dysfunction in critically ill patients with an increased risk for AKI. Accordingly, we hypothesized that pNGAL would independently predict adverse outcome in a heterogeneous group of critically ill adult patients with acute respiratory failure. Design and Setting Prospective, multi-centre study in 25 Finnish intensive care units. Patients and Methods pNGAL was measured from critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure. We evaluated the predictive value of pNGAL for RRT, and hospital and 90-day mortality first separately, second in addition to the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II), and third to RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-Stage Renal Disease) AKI classification. Additionally, we assessed the factors associated with pNGAL by linear regression analysis. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results We included 369 patients. Median (interquartile range) baseline pNGAL was 169 (92?370)?ng/ml. The areas under receiver operating characteristic curves of baseline pNGAL were as follows: 0.733 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.656?0.810] for RRT, 0.627 (95% CI 0.561?0.693) for hospital, and 0.582 (95% CI 0.520?0.645) for 90-day mortality. Present infection, baseline creatinine, operative status, and pancreatitis were independently associated with baseline pNGAL. Conclusions Baseline pNGAL gives no additional value into prediction of hospital and 90-day mortality compared with RIFLE or SAPS II, and has only moderate predictive power regarding RRT in critically ill adult patients with acute respiratory failure.

Acta Neurol Scand: 2010: 122 (Suppl. 190): 51?57. ? 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Objective??? To assess the temporal trends in the incidence and demographic characteristics of traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) with clinical concomitant traumatic brain injury (TBI), in an unselected, geographically defined cohort, 1952?2001. Material and methods??? The patients were identified from hospital records. TBI was classified as none, mild, moderate, and severe. Results??? Of 336 patients, 157 (46.7%) patients had a clinical concomitant TBI. Clinical TBI was classified as mild in 30.1%, moderate in 11.0% and severe in 5.7%. The average annual incidence increased from 3.3 per million in the first decade to 10.7 per million in the last. Alcohol was the strongest risk factor of clinical TBI (OR?=?3.69) followed by completeness of TSCI (OR?=?2.18). Conclusions??? The incidence of TSCI with concomitant TBI has increased during the last 50?years. Alcohol and completeness of injury are strong risk factors. Increased awareness of dual diagnoses is necessary.

AB  - Abstract Objective The study aims to describe the implementation of a primary practitioner physiotherapy service within a large regional ED and to evaluate its impact on waiting time and length of stay. Methods Integration and scope of practice of the physiotherapy service within the ED were described. Retrospective analysis of waiting time and length of stay data for the 3 years, 1 October 2008 to 30 September 2011, was performed. The performance of the physiotherapy service was compared with the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) waiting time guidelines, the Victorian Department of Health length of stay targets and to a similar group of patients seen by medical staff. Results The primary practitioner physiotherapy service saw 5641 patients of which 33% were less than 18 years old. The most common presentations seen by the service were limb fractures, soft tissue injuries and low back pain. Ninety-two per?cent of patients were seen within the ACEM waiting time guidelines, and 91% of patients who went home were discharged within 4?h. Non-randomised comparisons with similar patients seen by medical staff indicated that patients seen by the physiotherapy practitioner service had shorter waiting times and length of stay. Conclusions The current study found that patients with musculoskeletal problems seen by a primary practitioner physiotherapy service had improved waiting times and length of stay relative to ACEM and Victorian Department of Health targets, and though constrained by a retrospective non-randomised design, to a similar group of patients seen by medical staff. Further evaluation of the physiotherapy practitioner service is required.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? Non-operative management has become the treatment of choice in the majority of liver injuries. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in primary treatment and outcomes in a single Dutch Level 1 trauma centre with wide experience in angio-embolisation (AE). Methods:? The prospective trauma registry was retrospectively analysed for 7-year periods before (Period 1) and after (Period 2) the introduction of AE. The primary outcome was the failure rate of primary treatment defined as liver injury-related death or re-bleeding requiring radiologic or operative (re)interventions. Secondary outcomes were liver injury-related intra-abdominal complications. Results:? Despite an increase in high-grade liver injuries, the incidence of primary non-operative management more than doubled over the two periods, from 33% (20 of 61 cases) in Period 1 to 72% (84 of 116 cases) in Period 2 (P < 0.001). The failure rate of primary treatment in Period 1 was 18% (11/61), compared with 11% (13/116) in Period 2 (P= 0.21). Complication rates were 23% (14/61) and 16% (18/116) in Periods 1 and 2, respectively (P= 0.22). Liver-related mortality rates were 10% (6/61) and 3% (4/116) in Periods 1 and 2, respectively (P= 0.095). The increase in the frequency of non-operative management was even higher in high-grade injuries, in which outcomes were improved. In high-grade injuries in Periods 1 and 2, failure rates decreased from 45% (9/20) to 20% (11/55) (P= 0.041), liver-related mortality decreased from 30% (6/20) to 7% (4/55) (P= 0.019) and complication rates fell from 60% (12/20) to 27% (15/55) (P= 0.014). Liver infarction or necrosis and abscess formation seemed to occur more frequently with AE. Conclusions:? Overall, liver-related mortality, treatment failure and complication rates remained constant despite an increase in non-operative management. However, in high-grade injuries outcomes improved after the introduction of AE.
