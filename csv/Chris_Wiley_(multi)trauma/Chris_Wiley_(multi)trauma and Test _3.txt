AB  - Abstract Objectives:? Non-operative management has become the treatment of choice in the majority of liver injuries. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in primary treatment and outcomes in a single Dutch Level 1 trauma centre with wide experience in angio-embolisation (AE). Methods:? The prospective trauma registry was retrospectively analysed for 7-year periods before (Period 1) and after (Period 2) the introduction of AE. The primary outcome was the failure rate of primary treatment defined as liver injury-related death or re-bleeding requiring radiologic or operative (re)interventions. Secondary outcomes were liver injury-related intra-abdominal complications. Results:? Despite an increase in high-grade liver injuries, the incidence of primary non-operative management more than doubled over the two periods, from 33% (20 of 61 cases) in Period 1 to 72% (84 of 116 cases) in Period 2 (P < 0.001). The failure rate of primary treatment in Period 1 was 18% (11/61), compared with 11% (13/116) in Period 2 (P= 0.21). Complication rates were 23% (14/61) and 16% (18/116) in Periods 1 and 2, respectively (P= 0.22). Liver-related mortality rates were 10% (6/61) and 3% (4/116) in Periods 1 and 2, respectively (P= 0.095). The increase in the frequency of non-operative management was even higher in high-grade injuries, in which outcomes were improved. In high-grade injuries in Periods 1 and 2, failure rates decreased from 45% (9/20) to 20% (11/55) (P= 0.041), liver-related mortality decreased from 30% (6/20) to 7% (4/55) (P= 0.019) and complication rates fell from 60% (12/20) to 27% (15/55) (P= 0.014). Liver infarction or necrosis and abscess formation seemed to occur more frequently with AE. Conclusions:? Overall, liver-related mortality, treatment failure and complication rates remained constant despite an increase in non-operative management. However, in high-grade injuries outcomes improved after the introduction of AE.

AB  - Abstract Objective Evidence-based decision-making tools are widely used to guide cervical spine assessment in adult trauma patients. Similar tools validated for use in injured children are lacking. A paediatric-specific approach is appropriate given important differences in cervical spine anatomy, mechanism of spinal injury and concerns over ionising radiation in children. The present study aims to survey physicians' knowledge and application of cervical spine assessment in injured children. Methods A cross-sectional survey of physicians actively engaged in trauma care within a paediatric trauma centre was undertaken. Participation was voluntary and responses de-idenitified. The survey comprised 20 questions regarding initial assessment, imaging, immobilisation and perioperative management. Physicians' responses were compared with available current evidence. Results Sixty-seven physicians (28% registrars, 17% fellows and 55.2% consultants) participated. Physicians rated altered mental state, intoxication and distracting injury as the most important contraindications to cervical spine clearance in children. Fifty-four per cent considered adequate plain imaging to be 3-view cervical spine radiographs (anterior?posterior, lateral and odontoid), whereas 30% considered CT the most sensitive modality for detecting unstable cervical spine injuries. Physicians' responses reflected marked heterogeneity regarding semi-rigid cervical collars and what constitutes cervical spine ?clearance?. Greater consensus existed for perioperative precautions in this setting. Conclusions Physicians actively engaged in paediatric trauma care demonstrate marked heterogeneity in their knowledge and application of cervical spine assessment. This is compounded by a lack of paediatric-specific evidence and definitions, involvement of multiple specialties and staff turnover within busy departments. A validated decision-making tool for cervical spine assessment will represent an important advance in paediatric trauma.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the effect of including the fractured vertebra in the short-segment fixation of thoracolumbar (TL) fractures. Methods A total of 32 patients with thoraco-lumbar fractures, selected between August 2013 and February 2016, were managed by short-segment fixation with screws at the level of the fracture, and decompression was performed only for patients with neurological deficits. The patients' functional outcome was assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) score for pain and the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score for neurological condition. All patients were followed up with radiographs. Results Patients with complete neurologic deficits (n = 3) did not show any neurologic recovery. All ASIA B patients improved to ASIA C. Five ASIA C patients improved to ASIA E. The remaining five ASIA C patients improved to ASIA D. All ASIA D patients improved to ASIA B. At the final follow-up examination, the mean anterior vertebral height was 21?Â±?5?mm, indicating no significant height loss during the follow-up period. Conclusion Short-segment fixation of TL fractures with inclusion of the fracture level into the construct offers good correction of segmental kyphosis, vertebral wedging, and vertebral height loss.

AB  - Abstract Objective The study aimed to determine factors related to ICU mortality in critically ill patients transferred by Adult Retrieval Victoria (ARV) medical staff. Patients who died in ICU after interhospital transfer were compared against those who survived. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of ARV cases between 1 January 2009 and 30 June 2010. Retrieval data were linked with data from the ANZICS CORE APD (Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Centre for Outcome and Resource Evaluation Adult Patient Database). Victoria Data Linkage (VDL) performed linkage of data. Data included demographic and clinical data obtained during transfer and clinical data recorded in ICU. Results Of the 601 cases transferred by ARV during the study period, 549 cases were eligible for linkage to 25?543 ANZICS APD case records for the same period. VDL matched 460 of these cases (83.8%). Mortality rate in the matched sample was 13.9%. Variables associated with mortality were: advanced age (odds ratios [OR] 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00?1.04, P = 0.02), principal referral problem cardiac (OR 1.84, 95%CI 1.02?3.32, P = 0.04), lower mean arterial blood pressure (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95?0.99, P = 0.005) and tachycardia (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00?1.03, P = 0.008) on arrival at destination hospital. Conclusions Advanced age, lower mean arterial blood pressure and tachycardia towards the completion of transfer were associated with increased ICU mortality in this population. Clinicians should be aware of the additional risk for cardiac patients.

AB  - Abstract Background Adequate nutrition is linked to improved patient outcomes during critical illness. Nutrition care is further enhanced by registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) order-writing privileges, which improve the implementation of nutrition interventions. The purpose of this performance improvement project was to evaluate the effect of RDN order-writing privileges on enteral nutrition (EN) order compliance and nutrition delivery in selected intensive care units (ICUs) at a university-affiliated teaching hospital. Methods Patients admitted to selected ICUs from January 23, 2018, to January 25, 2018, were screened for eligibility. Demographic and nutrition data were collected retrospectively from the electronic health record. Percent of energy and protein needs met were calculated. Data were compared with historical internal controls identified prior to RDN order-writing privileges. Results Fifty adult patients (150 EN days) were included in data analysis, with 93 patients (279 EN days) included in historical data. Compared with historical data, cumulative EN order compliance increased by 17% and tube feed infusion rate compliance by 15% post-RDN order-writing privileges. Mean (Â± SD) protein needs delivered significantly increased from 72.1 Â± 28.6% to 89.1 Â± 24.8% after RDN order-writing implementation (P < 0.001). Conclusions RDN order-writing privileges improved EN order compliance and significantly improved protein delivery in selected ICUs. Future studies are recommended to confirm these results and determine if other variables besides protein delivery are statistically significant with a larger sample size.

AB  - Abstract This study examines the incidence and significance of novel plasma derived platelet aggregating activity (PAA) in 190 consecutive patients admitted to the medical wards of a general hospital. Seventy five patients (39%) demonstrated this activity. The incidence was highest in patients with a history of thrombosis (52%) or in those with a heightened thrombotic tendency, for example, patients with diabetes or hypertension. In contrast, platelet aggregating activity was observed in six out of 62 patients (approximately 10%) in whom a current or past medical history of thrombosis could not be elicited and in only two out of 72 healthy volunteers examined (3%). A high frequency of PAA was also noted in a small group of patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenia and patients who had previously received, platelet transfusions. In these patients, this activity presumably reflects the presence of antiplatelet antibodies. A good correlation between the presence of plasma derived platelet aggregating activity and the phenomenon of spontaneous platelet aggregation was observed. The platelet aggregating activity was not heparin dependent, but was completely abolished by EDTA (5 mM) and benzamidine (8 mM), or by pretreating the platelets with aspirin. A synergistic response was observed with subaggregatory concentrations of thrombin and adrenalin. Our results suggest that the presence of this platelet aggregating activity may provide a marker for vascular thrombosis. Furthermore we postulate that this plasma derived activity may be partly responsible for platelet hyperactivity previously observed in patients with thromboembolic disorders.

AB  - Abstract The aim was to evaluate the effect of HTK compared to UW and Euro?Collins (EC) on the initial graft function and long term graft survival in two prospective randomized studies. Only kidneys from heart-beating, kidney-only or kidney + heart donors were eligible for entry. Initial non-function (INF) was defined as the absence of life-sustaining renal function, requiring dialysis treatment on two or more occasions, during the first week after transplantation. To evaluate the contribution of the preservation solutions on INF in relation to other factors, a multivariate, 2-step logistic regression model was used. Randomization was performed between July 1990 and September 1992. The UW-HTK study comprised 342 donors and 611 transplants (UW: 168 donors and 297 transplants, HTK: 174 donors and 314 transplants). In the EC-HTK study 317 donors and 569 transplants were included (EC: 155 donors and 277 transplants, HTK: 162 donors and 292 transplants). INF occurred in 33 % of either HTK-(n = 105) or UW-(n= 99) preserved kidneys (P = NS), and in 29% of the HTK-(n= 85) and in 43% of the EC-(n= 119) preserved kidneys (P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed no significant influence of the preservation solution on the incidence of INF in the UW-HTK study, but factors contributing to INF were donor age, cause of death, retransplantation, and cold ischemic period. The EC-HTK study showed a significantly higher risk of INF, using EC as preservation, in addition to cold ischemic period and donor quality. The 3-year graft survival of HTK-preserved kidneys was 73 %, compared to 68 % for UW?preserved kidneys in the UW-HTK study (P = NS); while the 3-year graft survival of HTK preserved kidneys was 70 % compared to 67 % for EC-preserved kidneys in the EC-HTK study (P = NS). We can conclude that HTK is comparable to UW in its preservative abilities, using kidneys from heart-beating kidney-only donors, whereas EC as renal preservation solution should be avoided.

AB  - Summary Low donor supply and the high demand for transplantable organs is an international problem. The efficiency of organ procurement is often expressed by donor conversion rates (DCRs). These rates differ among countries, but a uniform starting point for defining a potential heart-beating donor is lacking. Imprecise definitions cause confusion; therefore, we call for a reproducible method like imminent brain death (IBD), which contains criteria in detail to determine potential heart-beating donors. Medical charts of 4814 patients who died on an ICU in Dutch university hospitals between January 2007 and December 2009 were reviewed for potential heart-beating donors. We compared two starting points: ?Severe Brain Damage? (SBD) (old definition) and IBD (new definition), which differ in the number of absent brainstem reflexes. Of the potential donors defined by IBD 45.6% fulfilled the formal brain death criteria, compared with 33.6% in the larger SBD group. This results in a higher DCR in the IBD group (40% vs. 29.5%). We illustrated important differences in DCRs when using two different definitions, even within one country. To allow comparison among countries and hospitals, one universal definition of a potential heart-beating donor should be used. Therefore, we propose the use of IBD.

AB  - Abstract A few studies have reported a relationship between leptin induced by brain injury and healing of bone tissue. Our objective was to measure serum and callus leptin expression within the setting of fracture and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Sixty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised equally into four groups: control, TBI group, fracture group and fracture/TBI group. Rats were sacrificed at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after fracture/TBI. Serum leptin was detected using radio-immunoassay, and callus formation was measured radiologically. Callus leptin was analysed with immunohistochemistry. Serum leptin was significantly increased in the fracture, TBI and combined fracture/TBI groups compared with the control group at 2 weeks (P < 0.05). Serum leptin was significantly higher in the combined fracture/TBI group than in the fracture and TBI groups at 4 and 8 weeks (P < 0.05). The percentage of leptin-positive cells in the callus and callus volume were significantly higher in the fracture/TBI group than in the fracture-only group (P < 0.001). Thus, we demonstrated elevated leptin expression within healing bone, particularly in the first 8 weeks of a rat model combining fracture and TBI. A close association exists between leptin levels and the degree of callus formation in fractures.

AB  - Acquired neuromuscular weakness due to critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy (CIPNM) frequently develops in patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit for more than 1?week. CIPNM may present with muscle weakness and failure to wean from mechanical ventilation, but is discovered more often and earlier by electrophysiological examination. In this review, the incidence, clinical and electrophysiological features, differential diagnosis and prognosis of CIPNM will be described. Risk factors for CIPNM are sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome and the severity of multi-organ failure. Presence of CIPNM is associated with higher mortality rate, prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and prolonged rehabilitation. The majority of survivors with CIPNM have persistent functional disabilities and a reduced quality of life. There is need for new therapeutic strategies to prevent or minimize CIPNM in critically ill patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between prealbumin, nutrient intake, and indicators of inflammation for recuperative and rehabilitative care patients. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. SETTING: Recuperative Care Unit within a Veterans Administration Nursing Home Care Unit. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred eleven men (100 white; mean age 80, range 64?93). MEASUREMENTS: Prealbumin and seven markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and their soluble receptors) were measured at admission and discharge (median length of stay 23 days, interquartile range 15?40 days). Detailed calorie counts were performed daily, and intake was expressed as a percentage of estimated requirements for protein (1.5?g/kg body weight per day) and energy (Harris-Benedict equation). The study objective was examined using least-squares regression analysis. RESULTS: Discharge prealbumin and the change in prealbumin were positively correlated with protein and energy intake and inversely correlated with markers of inflammation, particularly CRP and IL-6. When all covariates were included in a multivariable regression analysis, the markers of inflammation predominantly accounted for the variance in prealbumin change (56%), whereas discharge protein intake accounted for 6%. CONCLUSION: For older recuperative care patients, prealbumin and its change during hospitalization are positively associated with protein intake, but inflammation or changes in inflammation appear to exert a much more-powerful influence on prealbumin concentration. Given the potential confounding effects of inflammation, monitoring the change in prealbumin is not an adequate substitute for a more-detailed nutritional assessment in this population.

AB  - Abstract In June 2016, an advanced extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) program consisting of a multidisciplinary team was initiated at a large level-one trauma center. The program was created to standardize management for patients with a wide variety of pathologies, including trauma. This study evaluated the impact of the advanced ECMO program on the outcomes of traumatically injured patients undergoing ECMO. A retrospective cohort study was performed on all patients sustaining traumatic injury who required ECMO support from January 2014 to September 2017. The primary outcome was to determine survival in trauma ECMO patients in the two timeframes, before and after initiation of the advanced ECMO program. Secondary outcomes included complication rates, length of stay, ventilator usage, and ECMO days. One hundred and thirty eight patients were treated with ECMO during the study period. Of the 138 patients, 22 sustained traumatic injury. Seven patients were treated in our pre-group and 15 in our post-group. The majority of patients were treated with VV ECMO. Our post group VV ECMO extracorporeal survival rate was 64% and our survival to discharge was 55%. This study demonstrated an improvement in survival after implementation of our advanced ECMO program. The implementation of a multidisciplinary trauma ECMO team dedicated to the rescue of critically ill patients is the key for achieving excellent outcomes in the trauma population.

A total of 84 participants were screened second daily basis until discharge or death, over a consecutive 30-day period, out of which 33 participants with new PUs were identified giving a cumulative hospital-acquired PU incidence of 39Â·3% (33/84 participants). The incidence of medical devices-related PUs was 8Â·3% (7/84). Age, length of stay in the ICU, history of cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, infrequent repositioning, time of operation, emergency admission, mechanical ventilation and lower Braden Scale scores independently predicted the development of a PU. According to binary logistic regression analyses, age, longer stay in ICU and infrequent repositioning were significant predictors of all stages of PUs, while the length of stay in the ICU and infrequent repositioning were associated with the development of stages II?IV PUs. In conclusion, PU incidence rate was higher than that reported in other international studies. This indicates that urgent attention is required for PU prevention strategies in this setting.

AB  - Background Simulation-based medical education, often used for teaching teamwork, can be conducted in different settings: off-site (simulation centers or other settings away from clinical units) or in situ (real clinical environment), where the latter can be either announced or unannounced. Simulation in general, but especially unannounced in situ simulation, has been described as stressful and stress can affect learning. The aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility and the perception of learning and stress. Methods Sixteen standardized in situ simulations were planned in an emergency department on eight predetermined dates, with one unannounced and one announced simulation per day. Authentic ad hoc teams were formed based on the on-call staff and included doctors, nurses, radiographers, biochemist, porters, and secretaries. Data were collected using questionnaires and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Results Eleven of the 16 in situ simulations were completed. Self-perceived learning was ?good? or ?very good? for 27/47 (57%) participants and 33/50 (66%) in unannounced vs announced in situ simulation (PÂ =Â 0.33). Two of 47 (4%) in unannounced in situ simulation ?agreed or partly agreed? that in situ simulation was stressful or unpleasant vs 12/50 (24%) in announced in situ simulation (PÂ =Â 0.06). Conclusion No significant difference was found between unannounced and announced in situ simulation among emergency department staff according to self-perceived learning and self-perceived stress. This is relevant for the future planning of simulation when considering what is to be achieved from implementing different designs for simulation-based medical education.

AB  - Summary The inflammatory response to acute injury among humans has proved difficult to study due to the significant heterogeneity encountered in actual patients. We set out to characterize the immune response to a model injury with reduced heterogeneity, a tracheostomy, among stable critical care patients, using a broad cytokine panel and clinical data. Twenty-three critical care patients undergoing percutaneous bedside tracheostomies were recruited in a medical intensive care unit. Blood samples were collected at five intervals during 24-h peri-procedure. Patients were followed-up for 28 days for clinical outcomes. There were no statistically significant changes in any of the cytokines between the five time-points when studied as a whole cohort. Longitudinal analysis of the cytokine patterns at the individual patient level with a clustering algorithm showed that, notwithstanding the significant heterogeneity observed, the patients? cytokine responses can be classified into three broad patterns that show increasing, decreasing or no major changes from the baseline. This analytical approach also showed statistically significant associations between cytokines, with those most likely to be associated being interleukin (IL)-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) and ferritin, as well as a strong tri-way correlation between GCSF, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1? (MIP1?). In conclusion, in this standard human model of soft tissue injury, by applying longitudinal analysis at the individual level, we have been able to identify the cytokine patterns underlying the seemingly random, heterogeneous patient responses. We have also identified consistent cytokine interactions suggesting that IL-6, GCSF, MCP1 and MIP1? are the cytokines most probably driving the immune response to this injury.

AB  - Summary.? Experience of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa, NovoSeven?; Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) to control haemorrhage in non-haemophilic children is limited. The object of this study was to examine the applicability and safety of rFVIIa amongst a group of non-haemophilic paediatric subjects. Details of all non-haemophilic children â¤16?years receiving rFVIIa whose data were recorded in the investigational, internet-based registry, haemostasis.com were analysed. A total of 265 children (mean age 7.7?years) were treated with rFVIIa; the median dose administered was 78.4??g?kg?1 body weight (range 9.0?393.4) and the median total dose received 100.0??g?kg?1 body weight (range 10.9?1341.2). Therapeutic areas included surgery (34.5%), coagulopathy (including thrombocytopenia; 29.0%), spontaneous bleeding (17.2%), trauma (8.4%) and intracranial haemorrhage (4.5%). Two patients experienced thromboembolic events following administration of rFVIIa. Thirty-nine patients died on account of haemorrhage or complications relating to their underlying condition; neither the thromboembolic events nor the deaths were related to rFVIIa administration. Bleeding stopped in 118/237 (49.8%), markedly decreased in 54/237 (22.8%), decreased in 51/237 (21.5%), remained unchanged in 13/237 (5.5%) and increased in 1/237 (0.4%) patients. These results suggest that rFVIIa is safe and widely applicable in children to control non-haemophilic haemorrhage.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To determine the impact of the emergency physiotherapy service provided through different models of care on service quality indicators, patient flow, staff and patient satisfaction. Method A mixed method prospective observation study was conducted between September 2014 and April 2015 in 19 EDs where a physiotherapy service is provided. Results Patients seen by the primary contact physiotherapist (PCP) were associated with a significant reduction in ED length of stay by 108?min, wait time to treatment by 10 min (n =?4 EDs) and time-to-first analgesia by 18?min (n =?19 EDs) compared to those seen through usual care processes. Patients who received care by a doctor first and then physiotherapist (secondary contact model) had a prolonged length of stay compared to other care pathways. High levels of satisfaction with the PCP role were expressed by ED staff (n =?17 EDs) and patients (n =?19 EDs). More than 95% of patients who received care by PCP were satisfied with the management of their condition, understood the advice and discharge information provided and had enough time to ask questions. Conclusion ED implementation of the PCP model may improve patient flow and efficiency of clinical skill utilisation in a complex, high demand workplace.

AB  - Abstract Purpose This study tested the effectiveness of a pressure ulcer (PU) prevention bundle in reducing the incidence of PUs in critically ill patients in two Saudi intensive care units (ICUs). Design A two-arm cluster randomized experimental control trial. Methods Participants in the intervention group received the PU prevention bundle, while the control group received standard skin care as per the local ICU policies. Data collected included demographic variables (age, diagnosis, comorbidities, admission trajectory, length of stay) and clinical variables (Braden Scale score, severity of organ function score, mechanical ventilation, PU presence, and staging). All patients were followed every two days from admission through to discharge, death, or up to a maximum of 28 days. Data were analyzed with descriptive correlation statistics, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and Poisson regression. Findings The total number of participants recruited was 140: 70 control participants (with a total of 728 days of observation) and 70 intervention participants (784 days of observation). PU cumulative incidence was significantly lower in the intervention group (7.14%) compared to the control group (32.86%). Poisson regression revealed the likelihood of PU development was 70% lower in the intervention group. The intervention group had significantly less Stage I (p = .002) and Stage II PU development (p = .026). Conclusions Significant improvements were observed in PU-related outcomes with the implementation of the PU prevention bundle in the ICU; PU incidence, severity, and total number of PUs per patient were reduced. Clinical Relevance Utilizing a bundle approach and standardized nursing language through skin assessment and translation of the knowledge to practice has the potential to impact positively on the quality of care and patient outcome.
