AB  - Summary The severely injured trauma patient often arrives in the emergency department bleeding, coagulopathic and in need of a blood transfusion. The diagnosis and management of these patients has vastly improved with a better understanding of acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC). In the emergency setting, traditional laboratory coagulation screens are of limited use in the diagnosis and management of life-threatening bleeding. Whole blood assays, such as thrombelastography (TEG) and rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM) provide a rapid evaluation of clot formation, strength and lysis. Rapid diagnosis of ATC and aggressive haemostatic transfusion strategies utilizing early high doses of plasma are associated with improved outcomes in trauma. At present there is no accurate guide for transfusion in trauma, therefore blood and clotting products are administered on an empiric basis. Targeted transfusion therapy for major trauma haemorrhage based on comprehensive and rapid measures of coagulation e.g. TEG/ROTEM may lead to improved outcomes while optimizing blood utilization. Evidence for the clinical application of TEG and ROTEM in trauma is emerging with a number of studies evaluating their ability to diagnose coagulopathy early and facilitate goal-directed transfusion. This review explores current controversies and best practice in the diagnosis and management of major haemorrhage in trauma.

AB  - Summary Traumatic injuries to the musculoskeletal system are extremely common. These injuries are among the short list of medical disorders that may be completely resolved if recognized and appropriately treated. Radiologists have an important role in the diagnosis. In order to identify the abnormality and characterize it correctly, it is essential to be familiar with normal anatomy, protocols for imaging tests, patterns of injury, and implement an organized approach to image interpretation. The American College of Radiology (ACR) devised guidelines for selecting the appropriate imaging test in a patient who sustained musculoskeletal trauma. This chapter deals with different imaging tests, including radiographs, Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, bone scintigraphy and ultrasound. The radiology report needs to be concise, yet include relevant information required for effective clinical management. It is important to be familiar with common fracture classification systems and understand how different grades of injury potentially affect treatment.

AB  - Summary Injury is a leading cause of death and disability, carrying with it a large economic burden to society. Young adults are over-represented in this patient group, with the highest economic impact due to years of productive life lost. Regional trauma system planning as well as specific, organised, in-hospital trauma team responses are required to ensure that experienced reception, investigation, decision-making and intervention are both timely and optimised. Trauma guidelines and protocols are the best means of ensuring a thorough and safe approach to injured patients overall, although none of these can function as an alternative to the on-site presence of a clinician with surgical experience. In total, all these approaches are essential for minimising avoidable in-hospital deaths and morbidity in severely injured patients.

AB  - Background:? We investigated (1) the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in treatment-seeking subjects with substance use dependence (SUD), (2) the association between comorbid PTSD and the severity and course of addiction and psychopathology, and (3) this association in patients with subsyndromal PTSD, and in trauma exposure without PTSD. Methods:? In this cross-sectional study, 459 subjects in 14 German addiction treatment centers participated with alcohol-dependence (A) in 39.7%, drug-dependence (D) in 33.6%, or both (AD) 26.8%. The diagnostic measures included the International Diagnostic Checklists (IDCL), Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), Addiction Severity Index (ASI), and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Associations between independent characteristics and outcomes were analysed by univariate and multivariate statistics. Results:? 25.3% of the subjects had PTSD confirmed by both IDCL and PDS with higher rates in the AD (34.1%) and D (29.9%) groups compared with group A (15.4%, p?<?0.001). In 22.8%, PTSD was subsyndromal (either IDCL or PDS positive) without significant differences between SUD groups, and 18.3% met PTSD trauma criteria A without PTSD (exposure). After controlling for SUD and gender, trauma subgroups significantly differed regarding the onset of alcohol-related symptoms (p?<?0.02), numbers of previous admissions (p?<?0.03), severity of SUD (p?<?0.001), current craving (p?<?0.02), and psychopathology (p?<?0.001). We observed the worst outcome in PTSD, while trauma exposure had no effects. Conclusions:? The prevalence of PTSD is higher in drug than in alcohol dependence. The more strictly PTSD is diagnosed (by interviewer and questionnaire) the more clearly are associations with characteristics of SUD. PTSD seems to be an independent risk factor for an unfavorable outcome of SUD.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? Victoria's new trauma care system has been followed by reductions in preventable and potentially preventable deaths and in deficiencies contributing to death. This improvement has followed triaging more patients to expanded major trauma services where mortality was already lower rather than to improved results within the major trauma services, metropolitan or rural trauma services or ambulance services, Victoria. The objective of the present study was to identify continuing inadequacies within the individual trauma services and in association with representatives of these services to develop appropriate countermeasures. Methods:? Initially, presentations were made to each trauma service of their fatalities evaluated after introduction of the new trauma system. At separate working party meetings with each service consensus recommendations were finalized and these disseminated to stakeholders. Results:? Recommendations related to the need for Trauma Director/Coordinator appointments at all designated hospitals receiving major trauma, improved facilities and equipment, the trauma team, referral, communications, protocols, a prompting system, education, audit and feedback, infrastructure, staffing, documentation and inter-hospital patient transfer. Conclusion:? Interaction between the Consultative Committee on Road Traffic Fatalities and Victorian trauma services identified continuing deficiencies in the new trauma care system and developed consensus recommendations to target these problems. These require implementation through the State Trauma Committee.

AB  - SUMMARY The use of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) in trauma patients is an exciting application because hemorrhage and coagulopathy play prominent roles both in the syndrome of severe hemorrhagic shock and in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Anecdotal use of rFVIIa in non-hemophilic trauma patients extends back to 1999, and experience at individual institutions is now in the hundreds of cases. Efficacy in controlling traumatic coagulopathy approaches 80%, with long-term survival of about half of the patients treated. There have been few reports of inappropriate thrombotic events in trauma patients. A single prospective randomized study of rFVIIa in victims of hemorrhagic shock has been completed, with some favorable results. Further trials in hemorrhagic shock are underway in both European and American trauma centers, while a trial in TBI patients will begin within the coming year.

AB  - Abstract Research findings have documented a relationship between the number of types of traumatic events to which refugees were exposed and psychological disorders. It is unclear, however, if gender moderates the impact of trauma on refugee mental health. The participants in this study were 60 male and 31 female refugees and asylum-seekers resettled in Australia. Participants had a mean age of 34.54 years (SD = 9.70), and were from a variety of countries including Iraq, Iran, and Sri Lanka. We conducted a multigroup path analysis to test if the relationship between psychological outcomes of exposure to trauma (posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] symptoms, symptoms of anxiety, and symptoms of depression) was different as a function of the type of traumatic exposure (interpersonal vs. noninterpersonal) or as a function of gender. We found a significant relationship between interpersonal trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms (? = .77) and anxiety symptoms (? = .32) in women, and a significant association between noninterpersonal trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms (? = .59), anxiety (? =.49), and depression symptoms (? = .32) in men. For men, the effect sizes of the relationship between exposure to specific types of noninterpersonal trauma and psychological symptoms ranged from d = 0.14 to 1.01; for exposure to interpersonal trauma, they ranged from d = ?0.53 to 0.43. For women, the effect sizes of the relationship between exposure to specific types of noninterpersonal trauma and psychological symptoms ranged from d = ?0.79 to 0.67; for exposure to interpersonal trauma, they ranged from d = ?0.09 to 1.46. These results suggested supporting refugees in their efforts to overcome the psychological impact of trauma, including the allocation of resources in clinical services to support the psychological recovery of refugees.

AB  - Aims To Describe injury profile and costs of older person trauma in New South Wales; quantify variations with peer group costs; and identify predictors of higher costs. Methods Nine level 1 New South Wales trauma centres provided data on major traumas (aged ≥55 years) during 2008?2009 financial year. Trauma register and financial data of each institution were linked. Treatment costs were compared with peer group Australian Refined Diagnostic Related Groups costs, on which hospital funding is based. Variables examined through multivariate analyses. Results Six thousand two hundred and eighty-nine patients were admitted for trauma. Most common injury mechanism was falls (74.8%) then road trauma (14.9%). Median patient cost was $7044 (Q1-3: $3405?13 930) and total treatment costs $76 694 252. Treatment costs were $5 813 975 above peer group average. Intensive care unit admission, age, injury severity score, length of stay and traumatic brain injury were independent predictors of increased costs. Conclusion Older person trauma attracts greater costs and length of stay. Cost increases with age and injury severity. Hospital financial information and trauma registry data provides accurate cost information that may inform future funding.

AB  - Abstract The Chinese version of the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS-C) was developed to respond to the need of Chinese-speaking individuals. The DTS is a validated self-rating scale used in the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The DTS-C is translated from DTS through a two-stage translation. Subjects were drawn from a sample of 210 survivors of the 21 September 1999, Chi-Chi Earthquake. The scale showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.97) and test?retest reliability (r = 0.88). Concurrent validity was obtained against the clinical diagnostic interview, with a diagnostic accuracy of 0.85 at DTS-C score of 44. It showed that the sensitivity was 0.9, specificity 0.81, positive likelihood ratio 4.74, and negative likelihood ratio 0.12. The recommended stratum-specific likelihood ratios were 0.10 (95% CI: 0.05?0.20) for the score range 0?39, 4 (2.22?7.23) for the score range of 40?59, and 6.14 (3.42?11.02) for the scores above 60. In PTSD diagnosed subjects, the factor structures closely resembled the DSM-IV grouping of PTSD symptoms. The psychometric strength of DTS-C is reliable for its future use, particularly for screening for subjects with possible diagnosis of PTSD.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the peripheral vascular trauma. The presence of a vascular ?hard sign? is highly specific for major vascular injury and mandates operative exploration, however, absence of hard signs does not reliably exclude injury. In contrast, the ?soft signs? of vascular injury does not reliably predict major vascular trauma. It is generally accepted that in the absence of hard signs, patients with a normal peripheral vascular examination does not require further investigation regardless of the presence of soft signs. The arterial pressure index (API) has gained acceptance in some trauma centers as a useful tool in the evaluation of peripheral vascular trauma. While duplex ultrasonography is non-invasive, it is less sensitive in the diagnosis of peripheral vascular trauma than angiography and requires the presence of a trained ultrasonographer, who may not be available at all times.

AB  - Background: Severe truncal multi trauma patients often develop coagulopathy, acidosis and hypothermia that makes major reparative trauma surgery dangerous. It was aimed to try to develop physiological indicators that would predict a poor outcome when conventional reparative surgery was applied. These indicators may help in the decision to switch from conventional reparative surgery to surgery limited to the control of major haemorrhage or organ disruption: so-called ?damage-control? surgery. Method: A retrospective review was conducted of 40 patients with severe multivisceral trauma (Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 35) who were admitted to the intensive care unit at Waikato Hospital and who underwent conventional reparative surgery. Results: Survival was strongly associated with base deficit (BD), core temperature and ISS. Using multiple logistic regression on these indices, outcome could be predicted with 92.5% accuracy (sensitivity = 93%, specificity = 92%, positive predictive value for death = 96%). Either severe hypothermia (< 33°C) or severe acidosis (BD > 12 mEq/L), or a combination of moderate core temperature < 35.5°C, and a BD of > 5 mEq/L were strong predictors of death if conventional reparative surgery was practised. Conclusions: At the abovementioned levels of physiological compromise, patient survival after conventional trauma surgery can be predicted to be very unlikely. Damage-control measures would be worth attempting.

AB  - ABSTRACT We examined how diverse and cumulated traumatic experiences predicted maternal prenatal mental health and infant stress regulation in war conditions and whether maternal mental health mediated the association between trauma and infant stress regulation. Participants were 511 Palestinian mothers from the Gaza Strip who reported exposure to current war trauma (WT), past childhood emotional (CEA) and physical abuse, socioeconomic status (SES), prenatal mental health problems (posttraumatic stress disorder and depression symptoms), and perceived stress during their secondtrimester of pregnancy as well as infant stress regulation at 4 months. While all trauma types were associated with high levels of prenatal symptoms, CEA had the most wide-ranging effects and was uniquely associated with depression symptoms. Concerning infant stress regulation, mothers? CEA predicted negative affectivity, but only among mothers with low WT. Against hypothesis, the effects of maternal trauma on infant stress regulation were not mediated by mental health symptoms. Mothers? higher SES was associated with better infant stress regulation whereas infant prematurity and male sex predisposed for difficulties. Our findings suggest that maternal childhood abuse, especially CEA, should be a central treatment target among war-exposed families. Cumulated psychosocial stressors might increase the risk for transgenerational problems.

AB  - Abstract Objective:? To investigate differences between paediatric patients with moderate to severe trauma admitted from two paediatric ED, with respect to: demographics, patterns of presentation, mechanism of injury, injury severity scores (ISS), interventions and outcome. Method:? Retrospective cohort study. Moderate to severe trauma was defined as ISS >9. Paediatric patients admitted to hospital via Starship Children's Emergency or KidzFirst ED, with trauma from 1 May 2003 to 30 April 2004, with ISS >9 were identified using multiple databases. The charts were reviewed and data collected included: demographics, hospital of first presentation, diagnoses, ISS, Paediatric trauma score (PTS), Glasgow coma score (GCS), ventilator hours, length of admission, survival and discharge destination. Descriptive statistics with 95% confidence intervals, Mann?Whitney U-test, ?2-test and Fisher's exact test were used as appropriate. Results:? A total of 393 children with moderate to severe trauma were identified using initial search strategies. Of these, 82 children met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study; 42 children were admitted via KidzFirst ED and 40 via Starship Children's ED. There was no statistically significant difference in ISS (P= 0.86), PTS (P= 0.11), GCS (P= 0.62), hours on a ventilator (P= 0.28) and length of stay (P= 0.87) between children admitted from Starship or KidzFirst ED. Conclusion:? This study suggests that there are no differences in the numbers or severity of paediatric trauma patients admitted from the Starship and KidzFirst ED. This indicates triage is to the closest ED despite having a tertiary referral centre for paediatric trauma available in Auckland City.

AB  - Abstract Objective Evidence-based decision-making tools are widely used to guide cervical spine assessment in adult trauma patients. Similar tools validated for use in injured children are lacking. A paediatric-specific approach is appropriate given important differences in cervical spine anatomy, mechanism of spinal injury and concerns over ionising radiation in children. The present study aims to survey physicians' knowledge and application of cervical spine assessment in injured children. Methods A cross-sectional survey of physicians actively engaged in trauma care within a paediatric trauma centre was undertaken. Participation was voluntary and responses de-idenitified. The survey comprised 20 questions regarding initial assessment, imaging, immobilisation and perioperative management. Physicians' responses were compared with available current evidence. Results Sixty-seven physicians (28% registrars, 17% fellows and 55.2% consultants) participated. Physicians rated altered mental state, intoxication and distracting injury as the most important contraindications to cervical spine clearance in children. Fifty-four per cent considered adequate plain imaging to be 3-view cervical spine radiographs (anterior?posterior, lateral and odontoid), whereas 30% considered CT the most sensitive modality for detecting unstable cervical spine injuries. Physicians' responses reflected marked heterogeneity regarding semi-rigid cervical collars and what constitutes cervical spine ?clearance?. Greater consensus existed for perioperative precautions in this setting. Conclusions Physicians actively engaged in paediatric trauma care demonstrate marked heterogeneity in their knowledge and application of cervical spine assessment. This is compounded by a lack of paediatric-specific evidence and definitions, involvement of multiple specialties and staff turnover within busy departments. A validated decision-making tool for cervical spine assessment will represent an important advance in paediatric trauma.

AB  - Abstract We investigated the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) module's trauma screen of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), a single-item traumatic event history query. Compared to the Stressful Life Events Screening Questionnaire (SLESQ), the SCID trauma screen was 76% sensitive in identifying trauma histories in 199 medical patients (correctly ruling out 67%) but only 66% sensitive in 253 college students (ruling out 87%). A modified, more behaviorally specific SCID trauma screen (M-SCID) yielded poorer results in identifying trauma among 245 additional college students. Based on probable PTSD diagnoses (PTSD Symptom Scale), using the SCID screen instead of the SLESQ, 3% (M-SCID screen) to 11?14% (standard SCID) of PTSD cases were missed due to not having a trauma history. Our results lend support to previous research establishing the SCID trauma screen as a useful screening device in settings where a more comprehensive trauma screen is not possible.

AB  - Objective. To reevaluate the usefulness of ultrasonography for detecting and classifying solid-organ injuries from blunt abdominal trauma by comparing ultrasonography with computed tomography (CT) and laparotomy. Methods. Six hundred four patients with blunt abdominal trauma were examined by both B-mode ultrasonography and CT for a study period of 14 years. The ultrasonographic examiners were divided into 2 groups depending on their experience with ultrasonography. The ultrasonographic results were then compared with CT and surgical findings. This was a retrospective study. Results. In 198 patients, solid-organ injuries were identified on CT, laparotomy, or both. Sensitivity values in group A (experts) were 87.5% for hepatic injuries, 85.4% for splenic injuries, 77.6% for renal injuries, and 44.4% for pancreatic injuries. Sensitivity values in group B were 46.2% for hepatic injuries, 50.0% for splenic injuries, and 44.1% for renal injuries. The detection rates in group A were 80% to 100% for different types of hepatic injuries except superficial injuries (20%) and 70% to 100% for different types of splenic injuries. The detection rates for renal parenchymal and pancreatic duct injuries were 53.3% and 80%, respectively. The detection rates for injuries requiring intervention were 86.1% in group A and 66.7% in group B. Conclusions. The sensitivity of ultrasonography with the use of CT and surgical findings as reference standards decreased compared with our prior study. However, ultrasonography was found to enable experienced examiners to detect and classify parenchymal injuries efficiently, despite disadvantages in detecting superficial and vascular injuries. Ultrasonography should be used to explore not only free fluid but also solid-organ injuries.

AB  - Abstract Research on the effects of childhood trauma has been limited by the lack of a comprehensive, reliable, and valid instrument that assesses the occurrence of early traumatic experiences. This paper presents the development and preliminary psychometric properties of an instrument, the Early Trauma Inventory (ETI), for the assessment of reported childhood trauma. The clinician-administered ETI is a 56-item interview for the assessment of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, as well as general traumatic experience (including items which range from parental loss to natural disaster). For each item of the ETI, frequency of abuse/trauma by developmental stage, onset and termination of abuse/trauma, perpetrator of the abuse/trauma, and impact on the individual are assessed. Initial analyses indicate acceptable inter-rater reliability, test-retest reliability, and internal consistency for the ETI. Comparisons between the ETI and other instruments for the assessment of trauma, as well as instruments for the measurement of symptoms related to abuse, such as dissociation and PTSD, demonstrated good convergent validity. Validity was also demonstrated based on the ability of the ETI to discriminate patients with PTSD from comparison subjects. Based on these findings, the ETI appears to be a reliable and valid instrument for the measurement of reported childhood trauma. Depression and Anxiety 12:1?12, 2000. ? 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
