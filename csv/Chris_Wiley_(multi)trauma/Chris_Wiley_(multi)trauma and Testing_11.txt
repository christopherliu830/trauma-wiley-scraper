AB  - Abstract An acute trauma to the CNS rapidly results in the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines that include interleukin-1 (IL-1). We report here that the levels of several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are also elevated following a corticectomy trauma injury to the mouse CNS. The delayed upregulation of MMPs compared to that for IL-1 suggests the possibility that inflammatory cytokines regulate MMP production in CNS trauma. To resolve this, we developed a method to isolate and maintain highly enriched human fetal neurons or astrocytes in culture and examined the regulation by cytokines of the activity of a subgroup of MMPs, the gelatinases (MMP-2 and -9). While both neuronal and astrocytic cultures displayed comparable MMP-2 activity, as evidenced by gelatin zymography, levels of MMP-9 were proportionately higher in neurons compared to astrocytes. Of a variety of cytokines and growth factors tested in vitro, only IL-1? was effective in increasing the neuronal expression of MMP-9. Finally, an IL-1 receptor antagonist attenuated the increase of neuronal MMP-9 in culture and abolished the injury-induced increase of MMP-9 in the mouse brain. These results implicate IL-1? as a key regulator of neuronal MMP-9 in culture and of the elevation of MMP-9 that occurs following mouse CNS trauma. J. Neurosci.

AB  - Abstract Three studies examined the effect of historical trauma reminders and criticism from international allies on attitudes toward current conflicts. In Study 1, Israeli participants (N?=?116) were primed with the Holocaust, and read either that the U.S. President Obama supports Israel's right to defend itself and attack Iran, or that he opposes such action. Then, support for preemptive violence was assessed. Study 2 (N?=?133) replicated this design, comparing inclusive and exclusive framings of the Holocaust. Study 3 (N?=?478), examined the effect of Holocaust reminders and criticism from the European Union on attitudes toward militant policies against Palestinians. All three studies found that Holocaust primes juxtaposed with international criticism increased support for aggression, especially under exclusive framings of the Holocaust. Study 3, however, found this effect only among left-wing participants. These findings indicate that when historical trauma is salient, international criticism may be ineffective and may even backfire.

AB  - Objectives Adverse life events are associated with increased likelihood of depression and poorer prognosis. Trauma-focused treatments (TFT) appear to be effective in decreasing comorbid depressive symptoms. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a TFT on the memories of aversive events for individuals with a primary diagnosis of depression. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 49 participants recruited from a 10-day outpatient group programme. All participants showed symptoms of depression with a subgroup (80%) meeting the DSM-5 criteria for a major depressive episode. Participants received treatment as usual (TAU); three additional individual trauma-focused sessions; or three additional individual assertiveness training sessions. Participants were assessed with regards to depression diagnosis and related symptoms. Results For participants with a major depressive episode, the addition of trauma-focused sessions significantly increased the likelihood of remission when compared to TAU, or additional assertiveness training. While no significant treatment difference was noted in depressive symptom change post-treatment, six weeks after treatment those who received an adjunct treatment were more likely to maintain treatment gains than those who received TAU. Furthermore, at 12-week follow-up, participants who received a TFT reported significantly fewer depressive symptoms than those who received assertiveness training. Conclusions While differences in outcomes were minimal immediately post-treatment, differences among treatment groups increased over time. Thus, as few as three additional TFT sessions may impact positively on symptom change for people completing a group programme for the treatment of depression. Practitioner points Depression is the greatest cause of disability worldwide. Adverse experiences are linked with an increased likelihood of depression, more severe symptoms and poor treatment outcomes following evidence-based interventions. As few as three trauma-focused sessions can improve treatment outcomes in terms of depression diagnosis and related symptoms for individuals receiving group cognitive behavioural therapy.

AB  - ABSTRACT Symptoms of vicarious trauma, coping strategies, and prevention suggestions were investigated with 105 judges. Participants completed a self-report measure developed for this study. The majority of judges (63%) reported one or more symptoms that they identified as work-related vicarious trauma experiences. Female judges reported more symptoms, as did judges with seven or more years of experience. In addition, female judges were more likely to report internalizing difficulties, while judges with more experience reported higher levels of externalizing/hostility symptoms. Coping and prevention strategies were multi-domain (i.e., personal, professional, and societal) and underscored the need for greater awareness and support for judges.

AB  - Background Heparin-binding protein (HBP) is a neutrophil-derived protein advocated as a biomarker in sepsis. We evaluated plasma HBP as a predictor of post-injury sepsis in trauma patients. Methods Ninety-seven trauma patients were studied during the first week of intensive care. Injury-related data were collected and clinical parameters registered daily. Plasma HBP was sampled on day 1, 3 and 5 after trauma and evaluated for associations with injury-related parameters and sepsis. The predictive properties of HBP were compared to C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC). Results Median Injury Severity Score was 33, one-third of the trauma patients received massive transfusion and a quarter was in shock on arrival. Overall 30-day mortality was 8%. Plasma HBP was significantly higher in severely injured patients and associated with shock on arrival, massive transfusions and organ failure. Septic patients had higher levels of HBP only on day 5. When evaluated for prediction of onset of sepsis during the two following days after plasma sampling by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, areas under the curves were non-significant for all time points. Similar patterns were seen for CRP and WBC. Conclusion In trauma patients, HBP levels are related to severity of injury and organ dysfunction. Heparin-binding protein was weakly associated with sepsis and only at the later stage of the observation period of 1 week. Moreover, HBP showed poor discriminatory properties as an early biomarker of post-injury sepsis. Trauma-induced inflammation during the post-injury phase may blunt the sepsis-predictive performance of HBP.

AB  - Abstract Aims Functional asymmetry of pelvic floor innervation has been shown to exist in healthy subjects, and has been proposed to be a predictor of increased risk for fecal incontinence in case of trauma. However, this remains to be shown for different clinical conditions such as traumatic childbirth. Methods A conventional surface EMG system was used to assess the innervation of the external anal sphincter. A symmetry index was used to define the relative EMG amplitude asymmetry of the external anal sphincter between 0 (symmetric) and 1 (asymmetric). Three cohorts were studied: 40 nulliparous women in the third trimester (Study 1), 15 primiparous women within 6 months following vaginal delivery without clinically apparent anal sphincter trauma (Study 2), and 50 women after childbirth-related third or fourth degree perineal tear 6?12 months postpartum (Study 3). Furthermore, all women underwent conventional anorectal manometry. Results Sixteen or forty nulliparous women reported signs of fecal incontinence; however, relative asymmetry was not correlated to symptom severity (P?=?0.345), and not to manometric measures (Study 1). In Study 2, Women who had suffered clinically apparent anal sphincter trauma (P?=?0.07) tended to have a stronger association between incontinence and asymmetry. In Study 3, 19/50 women reported moderate to severe incontinence. Asymmetry and symptom severity were significantly correlated (P?<?0.001). Patients with incontinence had a significantly higher asymmetry score than their continent counterparts. Conclusion Functional asymmetry of anal sphincter innervation is significantly associated with incontinence symptoms, but only after childbirth-related sphincter injuries and therefore, should be regarded as an additional risk factor.

AB  - Dr John Paul Stapp was not only the ?fastest human on earth;? he was also the quickest to stop. In 1954, Dr Stapp attained a then world record land speed of 632?mph (1020?km/h), going from a stand still to a speed faster than a .45 bullet in 5?s on a rocket sled, and then to a dead stop in 1.4?s, all in the name of safety. Stapp pioneered research on the effects of mechanical forces on living tissues during aircraft crashes. Stapp planned a series of tests on humans and set out to develop a harness to hold them. First, he used a dummy to perfect the harness and after 32 sled runs, he was ready to try it out on a human crash test dummy, himself. By 1954, Stapp had volunteered for 29 deceleration and windblast experiments. On his last run he sustained more than 40?g?s. He suffered fractured ribs and wrist, and retinal haemorrhages which left him temporarily blind. Whilst at the Air Force Stapp also began a car-crash study program to investigate fatalities in auto accidents. From this program, safety recommendations for the car industry were established including fastening seats more securely to the car body, improving bumper design and proving the effectiveness of seat belts. Stapp?s work resulted in the 3-point restraint system of today?s belts which has saved millions of lives. Stapp is also credited with coining one of the most famous phrases in history. One of his assistants, Capt E. Murphy, rigged a harness incorrectly yielding no data on the forces Stapp was subjected to. After discovering what happened, Stapp observed, ?If there are two or more ways to do something and one of those results in a catastrophe, then someone will do it that way.? It has been called ?Murphy?s Law? ever since.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Sonographers of a large, metropolitan health service were trained and credentialed in extended focussed assessment by sonography in trauma in preparation for a potential mass casualty incident. Given the prior ultrasound experience of this cohort, the suitability of an abbreviated credentialing pathway based upon that required for emergency physicians was evaluated. Method A training and credentialing process to teach extended focussed assessment by sonography in trauma was planned for sonographers. The model was based upon existing credentialing requirements for emergency physicians. The project was undertaken in two stages, using a ?train the trainer? approach. The initial stage trained and credentialed a group of senior sonographer trainers. This group then supported the training and credentialing of the wider sonographer cohort. Results Twenty-eight qualified sonographers were successfully trained and credentialed in extended focussed assessment by sonography in trauma scanning. Practical competency assessment demonstrated 100% (28/28) pass rate. Image interpretation assessment results also demonstrated 100% (28/28) pass rate. Conclusion An abbreviated model is suitable for the training and credentialing of sonographers in extended focussed assessment by sonography in trauma, given their pre-existing ultrasound skills and knowledge.

AB  - Abstract Background: Empyema post chest trauma is a morbid condition requiring operative intervention (thoracotomy and decortication). It is hypothesized that patients who have a complicated initial pleural drainage procedure are at increased risk of developing an empyema. Methods: All patients who underwent operative decortication for post-traumatic empyema over a 24?month period (July 2003 to June 2005) were included in the study. Data were collected on demographics, intercostal catheter (ICC) insertion, prehospital chest decompression and associated injuries. A matched group of patients who had ICC inserted for chest trauma and did not develop an empyema were used as controls. Results: Fourteen patients had decortications for post-traumatic empyema. Two of three pneumocaths and one ICC were placed within the lung. Five other patients had multiple ?attempts? at ICC insertion. Only two patients had a single uncomplicated ICC inserted. The empyema and control group were well matched in terms of age (mean age 40?years in each group, P?=?0.83), injury severity score (36.4 vs 35.3, P?=?0.85) and presence of chest, abdominal and multi-system injury. The empyema group had significantly longer median hospital stay (12.8 vs 28.7?days, P?=?0.05). The control group had less initial ICC inserted (median of 1.0 vs 2.0, P?=?0.02). Only one patient had a complicated ICC insertion, and two uncomplicated pneumocaths were placed. Conclusion: Patients with complex chest injuries in whom difficulties in initial pleural drainage are encountered are at increased risk of developing a post-traumatic empyema and have a prolonged hospital stay.

AB  - Abstract Objective Although trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBTs) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been applied worldwide, the nature of how these Western-based interventions are applied in diverse settings has varied. This paper systematically reviewed the literature on how trauma-focused CBTs have been applied and adapted cross-culturally. Method A systematic review of studies that discuss the process of cultural adaptation of trauma-focused CBTs. Results Seventeen papers were included and varied in the comprehensiveness of the adaptation process. Two studies stated that a theoretical framework was followed. Almost one-third of the studies did not report whether local stakeholders were involved in the process of application. Fifteen studies examined the efficacy of the adaptations and the results were positive, but the methodology and quality varied. Conclusion There are inconsistencies in how trauma-focused CBTs are culturally adapted. A systematic approach to the transportation of such therapies would enable greater investigation into the necessity and efficacy of such adaptations.

AB  - The mechanism of secondary damage spread after brain trauma remains unsolved. In this work, we redirected the attention to astrocytic communication pathways. Using an in vitro trauma model that consists of a scratch injury applied to an astrocyte monolayer, we found a significant and transient induction of connexin43 (Cx43) hemichannel activity in regions distal from the injury, which was maximal ?1 h after scratch. Two connexin hemichannel blockers, La3+ and the peptide Gap26, abolished the increased activity, which was also absent in Cx43 KO astrocytes. In addition, the scratch-induced increase of hemichannel activity was prevented by inhibition of P2 purinergic receptors. Changes in hemichannel activity took place with a particular spatial distribution, with cells located at ?17 mm away from the scratch presenting the highest activity (dye uptake). In contrast, the functional state of gap junction channels (dye coupling) was not significantly affected. Cx43 hemichannel activity was also enhanced by the acute extracellular application of 60 mM K+. The increase in hemichannel activity was associated with an increment in apoptotic cells at 24 h after scratch that was totally prevented by Gap26 peptide. These findings suggest that Cx43 hemichannels could be a new approach to prevent or reduce the secondary cell damage of brain trauma. GLIA 2015;63:1185?1199

AB  - Abstract A commitment to empathetic understanding shaped the field of religious studies; although subject to critique, it remains an important teaching practice where students are charged with the task of recognizing, and perhaps even appreciating, a worldview that appears significantly different from their own. However, when the focus of the course is historical trauma there are significant epistemological and ethical reasons empathetic understanding may not be our best pedagogical strategy. Drawing primarily on my experience teaching a general education class ?The Holocaust and Its Impact? at California State University, Bakersfield, I advocate replacing empathetic understanding with engaged witnessing as a pedagogical framework and strategy for teaching traumatic knowledge. To make this case, I delineate four qualities of engaged witnessing and demonstrate their use in teaching about the Holocaust.

AB  - Background: Blunt thoracic trauma is a major concern in critically ill patients. Repeated lung diagnostic evaluations are needed in order to follow up the clinical situation and the results of the therapeutic strategies. The aim of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate the possible role of lung ultrasound (LU) compared with bedside radiography (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) used as the gold standard in the evaluation of trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit with acute respiratory failure. Method: A total of 15 thoracic trauma patients were studied at intensive care unit (ICU) arrival (T1) and 48?h later (T2) with CT, CXR and LU. We evaluated the presence of pleural effusion (PE) and lung contusion (LC). For this purpose the lung parenchyma was divided into 12 regions so that we could compare 180 lung regions at T1 and T2, respectively. Results: Sensitivity of ultrasound was 0.94 for PE and 0.86 for LC while specificity 0.99 and 0.97, respectively. The likelihood ratio was 94 (?+) and 0.06 (??) for PE and 28.6 (?+) and 0.14 (??) for LC. Conclusions: Ultrasound provides a reliable noninvasive, bedside method for the assessment of chest trauma patients with acute respiratory failure in the ICU.

There are a number of settings that can result in multiplicity and that includes multiple endpoints, multiple pairwise comparisons in multi-arm trials, comparing treatments at multiple time points, comparing treatments within many subgroups and interim analyses. The regulatory position with regard to multiplicity is well expressed in ICH E9. This chapter discusses the relation to multiple primary endpoints and uses similar arguments to deal with other aspects of multiple testing. The Bonferroni method of adjustment has been mentioned as a method of preserving the overall 5 per cent type I error rate.

AB  - Abstract Tidal energy converters (turbines) are being developed in many countries as part of attempts to reduce reliance on hydrocarbon fuels. However, the moving blades of tidal turbines pose potential collision risks for marine animals. Accurate assessment of mortality risk as a result of collisions is essential for risk management during planning and consenting processes for marine energy developments. In the absence of information on the physical consequences of such collisions, predicting likely risks relies on theoretical collision risk models. The application of these at a population level usually assumes that all collisions result in mortality. This is unlikely and the approach therefore produces upwardly biased estimates of population consequences. In this study, we estimate the pathological consequences of direct collisions with tidal turbines using seal carcasses and physical models of tidal turbine blades. We quantify severe trauma at a range of impact speeds and to different areas of seal carcasses. A dose?response model was developed with associated uncertainty to determine an impact speed threshold of severe trauma to use in future collision risk models. Results showed that severe trauma was restricted to the thoracic region, with no evidence of injury to the lumbar or cervical spine. Pathological indicators of mortality were only predicted to occur in collision speeds in excess of 5.1 m/s (95% C.I. 3.2?6.6) and was affected by body condition; increasing blubber depth reduced the likelihood of severe trauma. Synthesis and applications. This study provides important information for policy makers and regulators looking to predict the potential impacts of tidal turbines on marine mammals. We demonstrate that the probability of severe trauma in seals due to collisions with turbine blades is highly dependent upon collision speed, and that the majority of predicted collisions are unlikely to cause fatal skeletal trauma. We recommend that collision risk models incorporate appropriate mortality assumptions to ensure accurate estimates of the population consequences are produced in risk assessments for tidal turbine deployments.

AB  - Childhood traumas are associated with suicidal behavior but this aspect has not been examined in relation to schizophrenia. In this study, 50 chronic schizophrenic patients who had attempted suicide were compared with 50 chronic schizophrenic patients who had never attempted suicide for their scores on the 34-item Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). It was found that schizophrenics who had attempted suicide reported significantly higher CTQ scores for emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional neglect, and physical neglect than schizophrenics who had never attempted suicide. Therefore, childhood trauma may be a risk factor predisposing schizophrenic patients to attempt suicide.

AB  - This study describes initial and one-year follow-up findings on verbal memory testing of two patients who sustained moderate head injuries. The two main purposes were (a) to capture the specific patterns of memory disorders shown by these two head-trauma patients, and (b) to explore the nature of the recovery of these disorders. Several episodic memory tests and semantic memory tests were employed as well as questions about autobiographical events having occurred prior to and after the trauma, and about various aspects of the accident itself causing the trauma. The main conclusions to be drawn from the study are that the memory disorders demonstrated are based on difficulties in memory organization, and that the two patients differ in the nature of the recovery of the deficits.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Pancreaticoduodenal trauma (PDT) is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity. In this study, contemporary trends were analysed using national data. Methods The Nationwide Inpatient Sample for 1998?2009 was queried for patients with PDT. Interventions including any operation (Any-Op) and pancreas-specific surgery (PSURG) were identified. Trends in treatment and outcomes were determined [complications, length of stay (LoS), mortality] for the Any-Op, PSURG and non-operative (Non-Op) groups. Analyses included chi-squared tests, Cochran?Armitage trend tests and logistic regression. Results A total of 27?216 patients (nationally weighted) with PDT were identified. Over time, the frequency of PDT increased by 8.3%, whereas the proportion of patients submitted to PSURG declined (from 21.7% to 19.8%; P = 0.0004) and the percentage of patients submitted to non-operative management increased (from 56.7% to 59.1%; P = 0.01). In the Non-Op group, mortality decreased from 9.7% to 8.6% (P < 0.001); morbidity and LoS remained unchanged at ?40% and ?12 days, respectively. In the PSURG group, mortality remained stable at ?15%, complications increased from 50.2% to 71.8% (P < 0.0001) and LoS remained stable at ?21 days. For all PDT patients, significant independent predictors of mortality included: the presence of combined pancreatic and duodenal injuries; penetrating trauma, and age >50 years. Having any operation (Any-Op) was associated with mortality, but PSURG was not a predictor of death. Conclusions The utilization of operations for PDT has declined without affecting mortality, but operative morbidity increased significantly over the 12 years to 2009. The development of an evidence-based approach to invasive manoeuvres and an early multidisciplinary approach involving pancreatic surgeons may improve outcomes in patients with these morbid injuries.
