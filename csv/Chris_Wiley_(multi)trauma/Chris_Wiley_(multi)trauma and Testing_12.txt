AB  - This study describes initial and one-year follow-up findings on verbal memory testing of two patients who sustained moderate head injuries. The two main purposes were (a) to capture the specific patterns of memory disorders shown by these two head-trauma patients, and (b) to explore the nature of the recovery of these disorders. Several episodic memory tests and semantic memory tests were employed as well as questions about autobiographical events having occurred prior to and after the trauma, and about various aspects of the accident itself causing the trauma. The main conclusions to be drawn from the study are that the memory disorders demonstrated are based on difficulties in memory organization, and that the two patients differ in the nature of the recovery of the deficits.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aim Dental trauma in school populations has a high frequency and school teachers are often close to the place where such injuries occur. However, many studies have confirmed the lack of knowledge as to how to act in these cases. The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge in regard to dental trauma of school teachers in Colombia. Materials and Methods A multicentre, descriptive cross-sectional study was performed in 251 schools using a stratified randomized sampling. A structured hard copy survey was personally delivered to 2390 school teachers in the selected schools. The survey contained questions related to work experience, teaching level and demographic data, as well as questions related to their knowledge of and attitude towards emergency dental trauma management. Results The response rate was 96%. Most of the school teachers (95%) had never received training related to dental trauma, although 35% had witnessed at least 1 case. Of 2296 school teachers surveyed, only 5.8% would have replanted an avulsed tooth. An association was found between work experience and appropriate management of an avulsed tooth. No significant differences were found in regard to school location (city), school type (private/public), gender and school teachers? education level. Conclusions The knowledge of school teachers in Colombia about emergency dental trauma management is inadequate. The findings strongly suggest a need for an education strategy with the involvement of the government, dentistry schools and private organizations.

AB  - Abstract Childhood trauma is associated with poor health outcomes in adulthood. Mechanisms for these associations are not well understood because past studies have focused predominantly on populations that have already developed physical and mental health problems. The present study examined the association between childhood trauma and stress-related vulnerability factors in a healthy adult sample (n = 79; 68% female, mean age = 27.5, SD = 6.5). Emotion regulation difficulties were examined as a potential mediator. Participants completed baseline laboratory assessments of reported childhood trauma, emotion regulation difficulties, prior month sleep quality, baseline impedance cardiography, and behavioral tests of executive functioning (EF) and a three-day experience sampling assessment protocol that included sleep diary, reported and objective pre-sleep arousal, daily hassles, and reported EF difficulties. Reported history of childhood abuse was significantly associated with difficulties in emotion regulation, self-report and objective pre-sleep arousal, diary-assessed sleep quality, daily hassles, and reported EF difficulties. Reported history of childhood neglect was associated with greater pre-sleep arousal and poorer EF-behavioral control. Emotion regulation difficulties mediated the relationship between childhood abuse and reported pre-sleep arousal, daily hassles, and reported EF difficulties. In conclusion, history of childhood trauma is associated with a variety of stress-related vulnerability factors in healthy adults that may be viable early intervention targets.

AB  - Purpose? Decision making in the management of combined major skeletal and soft tissue trauma to the lower limb is a complex process made more difficult by the uncertainty surrounding outcomes. The aim of this study is to review and present our experience with flap reconstruction of traumatic lower limb defects, with particular reference to in-hospital complications and outcomes related to timing, choice of flap and pre-existing complications. Methodology? Retrospective review of all lower limb flap reconstructions performed by the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Unit at the Alfred Hospital (largest trauma centre in Australasia) from 1 July 2001 to 20 October 2005 (51 month period). Results? Sixty-four patients had 83 flap reconstructions (35 free, 48 local) of 70 separate lower limb injuries. Twenty-seven flaps (32.5%) developed soft tissue infections and 16 fixation devices (25.8%) were complicated by deep metal infection. There were 6 (12.5%) local flap partial necrosis and 4 (11.4%) free flap failures. Three patients underwent secondary amputation during their initial admission. Thorough wound debridement and internal skeletal fixation were followed by earlier soft tissue coverage and lower deep metal infection rates. Limbs in which flaps were performed after Day 5 were more likely to develop deep metal infection (p?=?0.04) and suffer free flap failure or local flap partial necrosis (p?=?0.02). Conclusion? The current study presented our experience with flap reconstructions of complex lower limb injuries at a major trauma centre. Thorough wound debridement, internal fixation and early soft tissue coverage (within 5 days of injury) is associated with lower infection rates and optimal outcomes.

AB  - Summary This chapter explores the strengths and weaknesses of the radiological investigations used to investigate suspected abusive head trauma in children. Advice is offered regarding investigations that might reasonably be used in different clinical scenarios. Common misunderstandings, controversies and pitfalls that may arise if radiological findings are misinterpreted are discussed. The forensic significance of these findings is examined, with particular reference to estimates of time of injury and the range of possible explanations for these findings (e.g., the presence of extra-axial fluid around the brain). Forensic practitioners and radiologists are cautioned to avoid over-confidence regarding estimates of time of injury on the basis of fluid densities. Consideration must be given to minimizing confirmatory bias. The authors recommend that radiologists specifically mention in their reports the range of possible explanations for forensically important findings.

AB  - Summary The effect of patient-controlled analgesia during the emergency phase of care on the prevalence of persistent pain is unkown. We studied individuals with traumatic injuries or abdominal pain 6 months after hospital admission via the emergency department using an opportunistic observational study design. This was conducted using postal questionnaires that were sent to participants recruited to the multi-centre pain solutions in the emergency setting study. Patients with prior chronic pain states or opioid use were not studied. Questionnaires included the EQ5D, the Brief Pain Inventory and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale. Overall, 141 out of 286 (49% 95%CI 44?56%) patients were included in this follow-up study. Participants presenting with trauma were more likely to develop persistent pain than those presenting with abdominal pain, 45 out of 64 (70%) vs. 24 out of 77 (31%); 95%CI 24?54%, p < 0.001. There were no statistically significant associations between persistent pain and analgesic modality during hospital admission, age or sex. Across both abdominal pain and traumatic injury groups, participants with persistent pain had lower EQ5D mobility scores, worse overall health and higher anxiety and depression scores (p < 0.05). In the abdominal pain group, 13 out of 50 (26%) patients using patient-controlled analgesia developed persistent pain vs. 11 out of 27 (41%) of those with usual treatment; 95%CI for difference (control ? patient-controlled analgesia) ?8 to 39%, p = 0.183. Acute pain scores at the time of hospital admission were higher in participants who developed persistent pain; 95%CI 0.7?23.6, p = 0.039. For traumatic pain, 25 out of 35 (71%) patients given patient-controlled analgesia developed persistent pain vs. 20 out of 29 (69%) patients with usual treatment; 95%CI ?30 to 24%, p = 0.830. Persistent pain is common 6 months after hospital admission, particularly following trauma. The study findings suggest that it may be possible to reduce persistent pain (at least in patients with abdominal pain) by delivering better acute pain management. Further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.

AB  - Abstract Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have become pervasive in software design, and constitute an accepted method for interacting with software and other products. Although they have become increasingly easy to design using contemporary tool sets, and they make software easy to use for all types of users, there are some fundamental problems in testing GUI systems. Testing GUI systems is difficult, in that a GUI may posses a large number of states to be tested, the input space is extremely large because of the different permutations of user inputs and events, and complex GUI dependencies may exist. However, probably the greatest difficulty is detecting an effect when an error occurs, because it may not be observable on the screen to the tester, or otherwise not observable at the time to the tester (unless a traumatic event, such as a ?crash? occurs). The growth of the number of possible GUI tests is documented by, which illustrates why a GUI testing strategy must be systematic and scalable.By scalable,we mean that as the size of the GUI system increases, the number of tests required by the strategy increases either linearly or at most quadratically with the size of the GUI system. Two measures of GUI system size are the number of GUI objects and the total number of selections to be chosen by the user taken over all GUI objects. To give an idea of the potential growth of possible tests, if we need to test for arbitrary interactions of GUI objects or selections without regard to their order, this may grow as large as the product of all selections taken over all the GUI objects (geometric growth). On the other hand, if the GUI interactions depend on the orderof the objects or selections, then the potential number of tests may grow as large as a factorial growth in terms of the GUI objects and their selections. As of this writing, little about the number of these interactions (and hence required tests) for practical systems as known.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To identify and review evidence relating to the measurement properties of published multi-item outcome measures for the conservative management of lateral ligament injuries of the ankle. Methods? Systematic literature searches were used to identify measures, which were then assessed against pre-defined criteria relating to development, item content, reliability, validity and responsiveness. Results? Seven disease-specific measures of ankle status [Ankle Joint Functional Assessment Tool, Clinical Trauma Severity Score, Composite Inversion Injury Scale, Kaikkonen Functional Scale (KFS), Karlsson Ankle Function Score (KAFS), Olerud and Molander Ankle Score (OMAS), and the Point System] and two generic measures of health (McGill Pain Questionnaire, Sickness Impact Profile) met the review inclusion criteria. While all measures had been used in acute injuries, only two had also been applied during later stages of recovery (>6?months). The studies covered a comprehensive range of graded ligament injuries. Expert opinion dominated item generation for all measures. All measures lack evidence of test-retest or internal consistency reliability in patients with ankle sprain. Several measures were assessed for validity through comparison with other measures, but there was limited evidence of construct validity and no formal assessment of responsiveness for any measure. Conclusion? The disappointing lack of evidence for measurement properties suggests that any measure should be used with caution until appropriate evidence is provided. On the basis of limited evidence, the KFS offers the most promising approach to a combined clinician- and patient-assessment of ankle function, and the KAFS or OMAS if a patient-assessed evaluation of function is required.

AB  - The members of many professional and occupational groups (e.g., emergency services, social services, psychology, and financial sector) can become affected by traumatic events occurring in the workplace. Currently, a range of methodologies and assessment instruments are used in the study of this area, making comparison between studies difficult, and raising issues relating to the validity and reliability of the instruments. Existing research in this area is also hampered by it being predominantly cross-sectional in nature. This paper discusses the issues that need to be dealt with in order to put the study of work-related psychological trauma on a firm theoretical foundation. The issues canvassed include establishing assessment instruments using sound psychometric principles: the need for normative data: the methodological implications of longitudinal, multi-wave research design; and evaluating change.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic, disabling psychiatric disorder prevalent among civilian and military personnel in the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK). Current trauma-focused psychotherapies may place high emotional demands and lengthy treatment commitment that may hinder successful treatment completion for some patients. Accelerated resolution therapy (ART) is an emerging trauma-focused psychotherapy that is briefer than most current treatments. Materials and Methods This review describes the ART clinical protocol and theoretical underpinnings, its relationship to current treatments and formal established treatment guidelines and empirical research data. Also presented are new subgroup data for the use of ART among clients with PTSD and concomitant traumatic brain injury (TBI), and among US Special Operations Forces (SOF) personnel with extensive combat-related trauma exposure. Treatment response was defined as ≥10-point reduction on the 17-item PCL-M (PTSD Checklist). Results In subgroup analyses, mean treatment with ART consisted of approximately four sessions. Among 202 US service members/veterans, intention-to-treat response rates (assuming no response for non-completers) by TBI status were as follows: no TBI (58.1%, n = 105), mild TBI (60.4%, n = 48), moderate/severe TBI (46.9%, n = 49). Among 141 US service members/veterans, intention-to-treat response rates by SOF status were as follows: non-SOF (54.3%, n = 116), SOF (60.0%, n = 25). Conclusion The ART protocol aligns closely with established first-line trauma-focused psychotherapies and clinical guidelines. It appears to provide frequent clinical relief of symptoms of PTSD in an average of four sessions among military personnel with challenging clinical presentations, including concomitant TBI and extensive operational combat-related trauma.

AB  - Background Prehospital management of the traumatically injured patient has evolved significantly since the organization of emergency medical services across the United States in the 1970s. Initially focusing on the utilization of crystalloid solutions to restore shed blood volume, robust military and civilian trauma experiences led to a modern day shift towards balanced blood component and ultimately whole blood use for immediate volume replacement. In addition, prehospital transfusion or remote damage control resuscitation (RDRC) has been widely adopted. This has led to point of injury resuscitation using blood products both in the United States and abroad. Objectives This article will review the evolution of civilian and military prehospital resuscitation as well as the current practice of prehospital whole blood transfusion in the civilian trauma population in the United States. Additionally, we will provide an overview of our regional trauma system's use of whole blood with focus on the programme infrastructure, donor programme, product rotation schedule and logistical challenges. Finally, we provide three case report examples of the effective use of whole blood in our civilian emergency medical services (EMS) programs.

AB  - Abstract Background:? Most potentially preventable haemorrhagic deaths occur within 6?h of injury. Conventionally, blood component therapy delivery is measured by 24-h cumulative totals and ratios. The study aim was to examine the effect of a massive transfusion protocol (MTP) on early (6?h) balanced component therapy. Methods:? An 88-month retrospective clinical study at a level 1 trauma centre was undertaken, examining consecutive trauma patients receiving ≥10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) within 24?h, before (pre-MTP) and after implementation of MTP. Demographic data, injury severity score (ISS), abbreviated injury scale (AIS), shock parameters, coagulation profile, the need for surgical intervention (<24?h), mortality and intensive care unit length of stay were collected. The ratios of blood products given by 6?h, by 24?h and the time between administrations of components was collected and analysed. Results:? Pre-MTP and MTP patients had similar demographics, shock severity and initial laboratory findings. Despite MTP patients having had a higher ISS (42 ± 12 versus 36 ± 12, P < 0.05) and AIS head score (2.6 ± 1.8 versus 1.6 ± 2.0, P < 0.05), there was no difference in mortality. Area under the curve (AUC) of the MTP period showed earlier delivery of higher median ratios of fresh frozen plasma (FFP)/PRBC (P= 0.004). Similar findings were found for cryoprecipitate/PRBC and platelet/PRBC ratios. By 24?h, the AUC for FFP/PRBC ratios were no different. Discussion:? Implementation of MTP resulted in earlier balanced transfusion. The difference between the FFP/PRBC ratios of the two types of resuscitations levelled by 24?h. The efficacy of component therapy delivery should be measured earlier than 24?h.

AB  - Summary Renal injuries are mostly managed conservatively. Operative intervention with view of kidney salvage is possible. However, nephrectomy may be the only option to control life-threatening haemorrhage. During the conservative period, it is extremely important to keep patients under close monitoring because this will allow early identification of patients who will require surgical intervention. Ureteral injuries are relatively rare and mostly iatrogenic. Management of the ureteral injuries depends level of injury, severity, and on time (early or late) of recognition of the injury. Careful assessment (cystoscopy with retrograde pyelogram) and appropriate imaging computed tomography urogram or intravenous pyelogram (IVP) are essential to select most suitable method of repair of ureteral injury.

AB  - Abstract Severe hepatic trauma is a rare indication for liver transplantation (LT). We report our single-center experience of LT for hepatic trauma. Four new cases are discussed in light of a literature review in order to depict the pathways leading from hepatic trauma to LT and to assess the outcomes of this practice. LT is generally indicated in case of uncontrollable hemorrhage, acute liver failure, or post-traumatic late sequelae. Hepatic vessels thrombosis, sepsis, major hepatic resections, and a late referral are factors associated with the progression toward irreversible liver failure. Considering all reported cases, early patient and graft survival reached 68% and 62%, respectively, but in the last decade both have improved to 84%. LT after severe hepatic trauma is a sustainable practice considering the current good outcomes and the ineluctable death of these patients without LT.

AB  - Surprisingly often in the psychoanalyses of chronically depressed patients, depression represents an unconscious attempt to psychically cope with unbearable psychic pain following severe traumatisation: dissociative states, a chronified psychic state of shock, a disappearance of emotions, an emptying of the self and the object relationships, as well as a disappearance of the psyche in the body are among the possible consequences. The treatment of these difficult groups of analysands can also frequently bring analysts to the limits of the endurable. Often related to this is the repeated danger of denying the trauma, and a re-traumatisation of the analysand in the analytic situation. The lecture discusses the fact that in comparison with other therapeutic approaches, psychoanalysis has a highly differentiated conceptualisation of the psychic determinants and the treatment of chronic depression at his disposal. However, in order to retain its creativity and innovation as a scientific discipline and to be thus perceived in the non-psychoanalytic world, it must constantly further develop its conceptualization by way of systematic and extra-clinical research ? as is witnessed in the insufficient conceptual account of severe traumatisation during the genesis of chronic depression. In this connection, several exemplary examples from extra-clinical studies in the sphere of psychotherapeutic research, neurobiology, epigenetics and embodied cognitive science will be accounted for. As will be treated in the final part of this paper, of no less importance are the conceptualizations in clinical research on psychoanalysis, which are based on meticulous, careful analyses of trauma reactivation in the transference, and understanding and working through them in the analytic relationship.

AB  - SUMMARY Objectives To describe the ?Resuscitation with Pre-HospItaL bLood products? trial (RePHILL) ? a multi-centre randomised controlled trial of pre-hospital blood product (PHBP) administration vs standard care for traumatic haemorrhage. Background PHBP are increasingly used for pre-hospital trauma resuscitation despite a lack of robust evidence demonstrating superiority over crystalloids. Provision of PHBP carries additional logistical and regulatory implications, and requires a sustainable supply of universal blood components. Methods RePHILL is a multi-centre, two-arm, parallel group, open-label, phase III randomised controlled trial currently underway in the UK. Patients attended by a pre-hospital emergency medical team, with traumatic injury and hypotension (systolic blood pressure?<90?mmHg or absent radial pulse) believed to be due to traumatic haemorrhage are eligible. Exclusion criteria include age?<16?years, blood product receipt on scene prior to randomisation, Advanced Medical Directive forbidding blood product administration, pregnancy, isolated head injury and prisoners. A total of 490 patients will be recruited in a 1?: 1 ratio to receive either the intervention (up to two units of red blood cells and two units of lyophilised plasma) or the control (up to four boluses of 250?mL 0.9% saline). The primary outcome measure is a composite of failure to achieve lactate clearance of ≥20%/h over the first 2?hours after randomisation and all-cause mortality between recruitment and discharge from the primary receiving facility to non-acute care. Secondary outcomes include pre-hospital time, coagulation indices, in-hospital transfusion requirements and morbidity. Results Pilot study recruitment began in December 2016. Approval to proceed to the main trial was received in June 2017. Recruitment is expected to continue until 2020. Conclusions RePHILL will provide high-quality evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of PHBP resuscitation for trauma.

AB  - Abstract Objective To explore Australian psychologists' perspectives on the psychological treatment of complex posttraumatic stress disorder in young women aged 18?25?years with a history of childhood maltreatment. Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 psychologists from Melbourne, Australia experienced in the provision of psychological services to young women with complex trauma and a history of childhood maltreatment. Data were analysed thematically. Results Two overarching themes revealed the significance of (a) the need for psychologists to establish trust with young women with complex trauma and a history of childhood maltreatment in the therapy context and (b) the development of trust within young women's intra and interpersonal relationships as a baseline for further growth and recovery, which is facilitated by the trust which develops within the therapeutic relationship. Conclusion Qualitative studies of this kind provide valuable insight into the experiences and opinions of psychologists who provide treatment to young women with complex trauma and a history of childhood maltreatment in their daily psychological practices. This study revealed that according to psychologist?participants, the development and facilitation of trust and the ability to trust others is a central goal of psychological treatment for young women with complex trauma.
