AB  - Abstract Background and aims Emergency department (ED) alcohol-related presentation data are not routinely collected in Australia and New Zealand. It is likely that previous research has underestimated the numbers of patients presenting with alcohol-related conditions. This study aimed to quantify the level of alcohol harm presenting to EDs in Australia and New Zealand [Correction added on 23 Jan 2018, after first online publication: The ?aims? section was missing and is updated in this version]. Design Multi-centre, prospective study. Patients were screened prospectively for alcohol-related presentations during a 7-day period in December 2014. Part 1 involved screening to determine alcohol-positive ED presentations and data collection of patient demographic and clinical information. Part 2 involved a consent-based survey conducted with patients aged ≥ 14 years to perform Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scores. Setting Eight EDs in Australia and New Zealand, representing differing hospital role delineations. Participants A total of 8652 patients aged ≥ 14 years attended and 8435 (97.5%) were screened. Measurements The main outcome measure was the proportion of patients who had an alcohol-related presentation termed ?alcohol-positive?, using pre-defined criteria. It included injuries, intoxication, medical conditions and injuries caused by an alcohol-affected third party. Secondary outcomes included demographic and clinical information, the type of alcohol-related presentations and AUDIT scores. Findings A total of 801 [9.5%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 8.9?10.1%] presentations were identified as alcohol-positive, ranging between 4.9 and 15.2% throughout sites. Compared with alcohol-negative patients, alcohol-positive patients were more likely to be male [odds ratio (OR) = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.63?2.21], younger (median age 37 versus 46 years, P < 0.0001), arrive by ambulance (OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.68?2.25) or police/correctional vehicle (OR = 4.56, 95% CI = 3.05?6.81) and require immediate treatment (OR = 3.20, 95% CI = 2.03?05.06). The median AUDIT score was 16 (interquartile range = 10?24). Conclusions Almost one in 10 presentations to emergency departments in Australia and New Zealand are alcohol related.

AB  - Background: There is an evident need for improved management of elderly patients with trauma in order to avoid common and troublesome complications such as delirium. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an implementation of a multi-factorial program including intensified pre-hospital and perioperative treatment and care could reduce the incidence of delirium in elderly patients with hip fracture, cognitively intact at admission to the hospital. In addition, we explored the factors that characterize patients who developed delirium. Methods: A prospective, quasi-experimental design was used. A total of 263 patients with hip fracture (≥65 years), cognitively intact at admission, were consecutively included between April 2003 and April 2004. On 1 October 2003, a new program was introduced. All patients were screened for cognitive impairment within 30?min after admission to the emergency department using The Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ). To screen for delirium, patients were tested within 4?h of admission and thereafter daily, using the Organic Brain Syndrome scale. Results: The number of patients who developed delirium during hospitalization was 74 (28.1%), with a decrease from 34% (45 of 132) in the control group to 22% (29 of 131) in the intervention group (P=0.031). Patients who developed delirium were statistically older, more often had >4 prescribed drugs at admission and scored less well in the SPMSQ test. Conclusion: The use of a multi-factorial intervention program in elderly hip fracture patients, lucid at admission, reduced the incidence of delirium during hospitalization by 35%.

AB  - Summary The volumes and pH of gastric aspirates obtained from 110 children (aged 1?14 years) who underwent surgery for trauma were related to the duration of pre-operative starvation and to the interval between food and injury. Aspirates were larger in children fasted for 4?6 hours than in those fasted for up to 10 hours, and were larger in children injured within 2 hours of eating than in those in whom this interval was longer (p < 0.05). However, 19 of 39 children (49%) starved for over 8 hours had an aspirate of more than 0.4 ml/kg. as did five of 16 children (31%) injured 3 or more hours after eating. Thus, a ?safe? interval between oral intake and induction cannot be predicted. We conclude that securing the airway by prompt tracheal intubation is the safest way to manage any child who presents for emergency anaesthesia after trauma.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of the present study was first to investigate whether both teacher-reported classroom aggression (ATT) and teachers? interaction with school shooting media (ISSM) are predictors of teachers? secondary trauma related to school shootings (STSS) and to second, consider how participation in lockdown drills may moderate these relationships. Two measures were created to understand the levels of aggression teachers report occurs in their classrooms and to understand how teachers interact with media related to school shootings. Both ISSM and ATT were associated with higher levels of STSS. Lockdown drills did not appear to interact with these relationships to either strengthen or weaken them. Considering the importance of teachers? well-being and how it influences their ability to be effective teachers, continued investigation is warranted.

AB  - Abstract Pancreatic injury has a high morbidity and mortality. The integrity of the main pancreatic duct is the most important determinant of prognosis. Serum amylase, peritoneal lavage and computed tomography of the abdomen can assist with diagnosis but endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) is the most accurate investigation for diagnosing the site and extent of ductal disruption. However, it is invasive and can be associated with significant complications. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and secretin-enhanced MRCP probably parallel ERP in delineating pancreatic ductal injuries. They can also delineate the duct upstream to complete disruption, an area not visualized on ERP. In relation to therapy, endoscopic transpapillary drainage has been successfully used to heal duct disruptions in the early phase of pancreatic trauma and, in the delayed phase, to treat the complications of pancreatic duct injuries such as pseudocysts and pancreatic fistulae. Transpapillary drainage is especially effective in patients who have partial pancreatic duct disruption that can be bridged. Endoscopic transmural drainage has also been successfully used to treat post-traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts. Further large, prospective and randomized studies are required to adjudge the efficacy and long-term safety of pancreatic duct drainage in the treatment of post-traumatic pancreatic duct injuries.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between the scores of Braden scale and pressure ulcer development among critically ill patients. All patients who admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) in 3 months (during July?October 2010) were surveyed with Braden scale. Patients who gained higher score of Braden scale were at lower risk for pressure ulcer development compared with the other patients. Braden scale is a useful tool for predicting pressure ulcer development in trauma ICU patients. Also, factors such as age and level of consciousness may influence pressure ulcer development.

This case report describes a gelding that presented for weight loss, increased respiratory rate and effort and chronic intermittent epistaxis. During post mortem examination diffuse eosinophilic granulomatous lesions were identified in the lung and liver, leading to a diagnosis of MEED. Veno-occlusive pulmonary remodelling was also discovered, believed to be the cause of the chronic epistaxis and a result of the pulmonary fibrosis and eosinophilic granulomas.

AB  - Objective To investigate whether simulation-based obstetric team training in a simulation centre improves patient outcome. Design Multicentre, open, cluster randomised controlled trial. Setting Obstetric units in the Netherlands. Population Women with a singleton pregnancy beyond 24 weeks of gestation. Methods Random allocation of obstetric units to a 1-day, multi-professional, simulation-based team training focusing on crew resource management (CRM) in a simulation centre or to no such team training. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed at the cluster level, including a measurement 1 year prior to the intervention. Main outcome measures Primary outcome was a composite outcome of obstetric complications during the first year post-intervention, including low Apgar score, severe postpartum haemorrhage, trauma due to shoulder dystocia, eclampsia and hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. Maternal and perinatal mortality were also registered. Results Each study group included 12 units with a median unit size of 1224 women, combining for a total of 28 657 women. In total, 471 medical professionals received the training course. The composite outcome of obstetric complications did not differ between study groups [odds ratio (OR) 1.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80?1.3]. Team training reduced trauma due to shoulder dystocia (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.25?0.99) and increased invasive treatment for severe postpartum haemorrhage (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2?3.9) compared with no intervention. Other outcomes did not differ between study groups. Conclusion A 1-day, off-site, simulation-based team training, focusing on teamwork skills, did not reduce a composite of obstetric complications. Tweetable abstract 1-day, off-site, simulation-based team training did not reduce a composite of obstetric complications.

AB  - Abstract Objective Limited attention has been given to ocular injuries associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The retina is an extension of the central nervous system and evaluation of ocular damage may offer a less-invasive approach to gauge TBI severity and response to treatment. We aim to characterize acute changes in the mouse eye after exposure to two different models of TBI to assess the utility of eye damage as a surrogate to brain injury. Methods A model of blast TBI (bTBI) using a shock tube was compared to a lateral fluid percussion injury model (LFPI) using fluid pressure applied directly to the brain. Whole eyes were collected from mice 3 days post LFPI and 24 days post bTBI and were evaluated histologically using a hematoxylin and eosin stain. Results bTBI mice showed evidence of vitreous detachment in the posterior chamber in addition to vitreous hemorrhage with inflammatory cells. Subretinal hemorrhage, photoreceptor degeneration, and decreased cellularity in the retinal ganglion cell layer was also seen in bTBI mice. In contrast, eyes of LFPI mice showed evidence of anterior uveitis and subcapsular cataracts. Interpretation We demonstrated that variations in the type of TBI can result in drastically different phenotypic changes within the eye. As such, molecular and phenotypic changes in the eye following TBI may provide valuable information regarding the mechanism, severity, and ongoing pathophysiology of brain injury. Because vitreous samples are easily obtained, molecular changes within the eye could be utilized as biomarkers of TBI in human patients.

The patient sustained multiple traumatic injuries to the anterior maxilla in the primary and permanent dentition stages of development. Orthodontic considerations involved in this case included an unerupted maxillary right central incisor with dilaceration of its root, severe malocclusion, and compromised esthetics. Endodontic concerns were directed toward the traumatized primary and permanent maxillary incisors with subsequent devitalization of the maxillary right permanent central incisor and calcification of the maxillary left permanent incisor. Oral surgery, oral pathology and general dentistry were also involved throughout the course of treatment.

AB  - Studies on HIV acquisition and transmission in women exposed to sexual trauma throughout their life cycle are lacking, but some findings suggest that rates of HIV acquisition through coercive sex are significantly higher than that seen in consensual sex. Sexual trauma can also occur as a result of female genital mutilation, which makes sex extremely painful and can cause increased abrasions, lacerations, and inflammation, which enhances the risk of HIV acquisition. This review presents an overview of the immune system in the human female reproductive tract (FRT) from adolescence, through puberty to pregnancy and menopause. What is clear is that the foundation of information on immune protection in the FRT throughout the life cycle of women is extremely limited and at some stages such as adolescence and menopause are grossly lacking. Against this backdrop, forced or coercive sexual intercourse as well as genital mutilation further complicates our understanding of the biological risk factors that can result in transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To describe the epidemiology of traumatic brain injury (TBI) among children in Maryland and to examine factors that influence hospital admission. Methods: Statewide mortality, hospital discharge, and ambulatory care data were used to identify all TBI-related emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and deaths that occurred in 1998 to children aged 0-19 years according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's standard case definition and protocol. Inpatient admission was modeled as a function of patient, injury, and hospital characteristics. Results: The overall incidence of pediatric TBI (i.e., ED visits, hospitalizations, and deaths) in 1998 was 670/100,000. After controlling for injury severity and other factors, uninsured children were 40% less likely to be hospitalized (95% CI = 0.43 to 0.82) and children with Medicaid were 90% more likely to be hospitalized (95% CI = 1.42 to 2.54) than were those with private insurance. The presence of a major associated injury significantly influenced the likelihood of hospitalization, especially among children with a minor (OR = 8.8) to moderate (OR = 11.6) TBI. Children who presented to a trauma center hospital were significantly more likely to be hospitalized than children treated at a non-trauma center hospital, although this varied depending on income (OR = 1.8 for high versus low) and hospital volume (OR = 2.6 for a small hospital and OR = 29.0 for a large hospital). Conclusions: After adjusting for TBI severity and the presence of associated injuries, significant differences in hospitalization rates may exist among different patient subgroups and hospitals for children who sustain TBIs.

AB  - Background? Flail chest in thoracic trauma is associated with significant complications and carries high morbidity and mortality. At present there is no standardized management plan for flail chest. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors affecting morbidity, mortality, and length of stay in the hospital. Methods? We evaluated all patients admitted to our trauma centre between January 2002 and December 2004. Age, presence of pneumothorax, trauma severity score (ISS), length of stay, lung contusion and deaths were recorded. Results? There were 100 patients with a mean age of 52 (SD 19.8, range 17?90). The median length of stay was 17 days, and the average ISS score was 30 (SD 13.2). 74% had flail chest and lung contusion, 2 patients had pneumothorax, and 7 (7%) patients died 3 (5.4%) patients with 1?4 fractured ribs died, compared with 4 (8.9%) patients with 5 or more fractured ribs (p?=?0.70, Fisher?s exact test). The mean ISS score was 32.3 (SD 19.5) for those who died compared with 29.8 (SD 12.7) in those who did not die (p?=?0.63, t-test). There was a moderate positive correlation between ISS score and length of stay (r?=?0.36, p?=?0.0002, Pearson correlation coefficient). Conclusion? ISS score was found to be a moderate potential predictor on outcome regarding length of stay in the hospital. There is an apparent increased risk of death with more fractured ribs and therefore a standadised surgical management plan for ribs fixation may reduce the risk of death in this patient group.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of paratracheal air cysts (PACs), their correlation with different lung diseases and their connection with the trachea by chest multi detector computed tomography (MDCT). Methods We retrospectively reviewed chest MDCT images of 8240 consecutive patients obtained from January 2010 to December 2011 with a 16-detector multi-detector CT scanner. PACs were assessed for prevalence, location, level, size and the presence of visible communication with the trachea. MDCT diagnoses were classified as normal, primary or metastatic malignancies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia and other lung diseases. We randomly selected 330 patients who had no visible PACs for the control group. We evaluated the associations between patients' demographic findings (age and sex), MDCT findings of lung and the presence of PACs. The findings of the PACs and control groups were compared. Statistical analysis used chi-squared test and Mann?Whitney U-test for evaluation. Results PACs were presented in 301 patients (4%); 204 men and 97 women, ranging in age from 14 to 91 years (median?=?57 years). There was no significant difference in the presence of PACs by age (P?>?0.05). Male subjects showed higher prevalence (P?=?0.005). Fifty PACs (16.6%) showed communication with the trachea or main bronchus. Although the relation between COPD and PACs was statistically significant (P?<?0.001), there was no relation between primary or metastatic malignancies, pneumonia and other lung diseases and PACs. Conclusion PACs are common in MDCT and should not be misdiagnosed as pneumomediastinum. It should be kept in mind that PACs may be associated with COPD.

AB  - Abstract Several anaesthetic drugs have demonstrated antibacterial properties in vitro. Anaesthetics can primarily affect the cell wall of both susceptible and multi-resistant bacteria. They may also have a synergistic effect with conventional antibiotics through an unknown mechanism. We present three cases of a chronic venous ulcer infected by multi-resistant bacteria refractory to conventional systemic antibiotics, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Treatment with topical sevoflurane was performed for 1 month without systemic antibiotics. Patients with an MRSA infection showed progressive improvement with negative culture at the end of the treatment. Multi-drug-resistant P. aeruginosa infection persisted at the end of treatment with positive culture. The local adverse events were mild and transient, including heat, pruritus and erythema. Topical sevoflurane may have an antibacterial effect on sensitive and multi-resistant strains. It can allow more complete surgical cleaning, leaving a cleaner wound with less fibrin and necrotic tissue. This decreases the bacterial colonisation and therefore the infectious risk, the bad smell and the exudation. The simultaneous use of conventional antibiotics and topical sevoflurane can have a synergistic antimicrobial effect.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and trauma-related guilt are risk factors for suicidal ideation (SI) in veterans. Components of trauma-related guilt were examined as serial mediators of the relationship between PTSD and SI. In a sample of 53 OEF/OIF/OND combat veterans, PTSD had an indirect effect on SI through a serial mediation chain of guilt cognitions, distress, and global guilt, suggesting that trauma-related guilt via cognitions, distress, and global guilt is a pathway from PTSD to SI. Attention should be given to assessing and addressing trauma-related guilt in veterans experiencing PTSD to prevent SI.

AB  - Abstract Limb salvage in fungal osteomyelitis of the post-traumatic lower extremity represents a difficult clinical problem requiring aggressive management. We report lower extremity salvage by radical bony debridement, free tissue transfer, distraction osteogenesis with bone-docking, and a novel antifungal regimen in a clinical setting of infection with Scedosporium inflatum, historically requiring amputation in 100% of cases. We treated Scedosporium inflatum osteomyelitis of the tibia and calcaneus with radical debridement of infected bone, free partial medial rectus abdominis muscle flap coverage, transport distraction osteogenesis, and combination voriconazole/terbinafine chemotherapy, a novel antifungal regimen. We achieved successful control of the infection, limb salvage, and an excellent functional outcome through aggressive debridement of infected bone and soft tissue, elimination of dead space within the bony defect, the robust perfusion provided by the free flap, the hypervascular state induced by distraction osteogenesis, and the synergism of the novel antifungal regimen. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background Child survival initiatives historically prioritized efforts to reduce child morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases and maternal conditions. Little attention has been devoted to paediatric injuries in resource-limited settings. This study aimed to evaluate the demographics and outcomes of paediatric injury in a sub-Saharan African country in an effort to improve prevention and treatment. Methods A prospective trauma registry was established at the two university teaching campuses of the University of Rwanda to record systematically patient demographics, prehospital care, initial physiology and patient outcomes from May 2011 to July 2015. Univariable analysis was performed for demographic characteristics, injury mechanisms, geographical location and outcomes. Multivariable analysis was performed for mortality estimates. Results Of 11?036 patients in the registry, 3010 (27·3 per cent) were under 18?years of age. Paediatric patients were predominantly boys (69·9 per cent) and the median age was 8?years. The mortality rate was 4·8 per cent. Falls were the most common injury (45·3 per cent), followed by road traffic accidents (30·9 per cent), burns (10·7 per cent) and blunt force/assault (7·5 per cent). Patients treated in the capital city, Kigali, had a higher incidence of head injury (7·6 per cent versus 2·0 per cent in a rural town, P?<?0·001; odds ratio (OR) 4·08, 95 per cent c.i. 2·61 to 6·38) and a higher overall injury-related mortality rate (adjusted OR 3·00, 1·50 to 6·01; P = 0·019). Pedestrians had higher overall injury-related mortality compared with other road users (adjusted OR 3·26, 1·37 to 7·73; P = 0·007). Conclusion Paediatric injury is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality. Delineating trauma demographics is important when planning resource utilization and capacity-building efforts to address paediatric injury in low-resource settings and identify vulnerable populations.

AB  - Summary Emergency cricothyrotomy is a common feature in all difficult airway algorithms. It is the final step following a ?can't intubate, can't oxygenate? scenario. It is rarely performed and has a significant failure rate. There is variation in the reported size of the cricothyroid membrane, especially across population groups. Procedural failure may result from attempting to pass a device with too large an external diameter through the cricothyroid membrane. We aimed to determine the maximum height of the cricothyroid membrane in a UK trauma population. Electronic callipers were used to measure the maximum height of the cricothyroid membrane on 482 reformatted trauma computed tomography scans, 377 (78.2%) of which were in male patients. The mean (SD) height of the cricothyroid membrane, as independently measured by two radiologists, was 7.89 (2.21) mm and 7.88 (2.22) mm in male patients, and 6.00 (1.76) mm and 5.92 (1.71) mm in female patients. The presence of concurrent tracheal intubation or cervical spine immobilisation was found not to have a significant effect on cricothyroid membrane height. The cricothyroid membrane height in the study population was much smaller than that previously reported. Practitioners encountering patients who may require an emergency surgical airway should be aware of these data. Rescue airway equipment with variety of external diameters should be immediately available.
