AB  - Summary Ever since the introduction of dissociative identity disorder (DID) into the DSM-III in 1980, controversy has swirled around the nature and the validity of this diagnosis. Some prominent authors who are skeptical about the validity of the DID diagnosis have proposed a sociocognitive model through which DID is thought to be caused by clinicians who believe strongly in the diagnosis and who covertly mold patients to enact the symptoms of DID. However, there are clearly DID presentations that are credible, and treatment outcome research has demonstrated that DID is responsive to treatment?quite the opposite from what one would expect if the DID was essentially a shared delusion between patients and their therapists. Although there is little evidence that DID can be created through a sociocognitive model where no underlying dissociation exists, it seems likely that the precise symptoms of dissociation can be molded through cultural expectations. Given that the expression of some dissociative symptomatology may be somewhat malleable, it behooves clinicians to not superimpose any particular model of symptoms on patients. Cases of severe dissociative disorders are not all uniform in their symptomatic expression, and not all cases of DID are static and unchanging in their level of dissociation over time. Although there is no clear evidence that authentic DID can be iatrogenically created, patients with lesser degrees of dissociation can be pushed into DID-like presentation by naïve or overzealous therapists. Pseudo-dissociation can also arise from patients who erroneously come to believe that they have DID. Some of these patients do have some dissociative symptoms and some have trauma in their backgrounds. Others seem to suffer primarily from severe personality disorders with intense identity diffusion and internal emptiness. DID can also be factitious or malingered, especially by patients who are somewhat knowledgeable about the disorder. However, careful attention to the patient's presentation and history can often distinguish between authentic and feigned presentations. Current and future research will do much to clarify the various presentations of dissociation. There will also be an increased level of sophistication regarding the assessment of patients, including an understanding of prognosis, and the application of treatment models and treatment modalities. There are also understudied areas in trauma psychiatry that deserve closer scrutiny, such as the effects of trauma on sexuality and understanding the perpetrators of child sexual abuse. In more traditional areas of study, more information is needed to assist clinicians to understand what processes in treatment actually help patients. Experienced and accomplished psychotherapists need to both study and write about what they do, in order to pass down their wisdom and expertise to others who struggle with uncertainty and isolation in their clinical practice, and to future generations of clinicians. Finally, the clinical and academic communities involved with trauma treatment have a responsibility to continue to educate the public and our governmental institutions about the effects of psychological trauma. Experts in the trauma field have an important role in educating others and ensuring that proper attention and resources are allocated to the victims of trauma and victimization.

AB  - Abstract??? Studies have shown that some children and adolescents are affected only once with dental trauma, while others seem to be accident-prone and suffer from multiple dental trauma episodes. Less is known about treatment consequences related to repeated traumatic dental injuries to the same tooth and treatment guidelines are not well established. Complicated crown fractures and crown-root fractures pose difficulties for dentists to establish adequate treatment plans because these fractures require multidisciplinary knowledge and approach for a correct case planning and prognosis. The objective of this paper was to present and discuss a case of a child who sustained a second trauma to the same tooth following treatment of an earlier sustained crown fracture. The research-based background for establishment of the treatment plan is discussed. Reattachment of tooth fragment is a minimal invasive and esthetic method. Essential advantage of the reattached teeth is the fact that all the alternative methods as direct adhesive resin reconstruction, veneers and crowns can be performed in case of failure or a refracture. As a consequence of initial trauma, the tooth suffered a complicated crown fracture which was resolved by endodontic therapy and fragment reattachment. During follow-up, the child suffered a second trauma resulting in dislodgement and fracture of the reattached fragment and a crown-root fracture extending subgingivally with involvement of the biologic width. A conservative restorative option is described. After 1?year of follow-up, the clinical and radiographic findings demonstrated that the adopted clinical protocol was successful and yielded healthy periodontal tissues with no signs of periradicular pathosis. The occurrence of repeated traumatic dental injuries to teeth involving conservative management of both crown-root fracture and complicated crown fracture on the same tooth is extremely rare and a challenge for dental professionals to treat.

AB  - Abstract Background and aims Disentangling the putative impact of cannabis on brain morphology from other comorbid substance use is critical. After controlling for the effects of nicotine, alcohol and multi-substance use, this study aimed to determine whether frequent cannabis use is associated with significantly smaller subcortical grey matter volumes. Design Exploratory analyses using mixed linear models, one per region of interest (ROI), were performed whereby individual differences in volume (outcome) at seven subcortical ROIs were regressed onto cannabis and comorbid substance use (predictors). Setting Two large population-based twin samples from the United States and Australia. Participants A total of 622 young Australian adults [66% female; ?age = 25.9, standard deviation SD) = 3.6] and 474 middle-aged US males (?age = 56.1SD = 2.6) of predominately Anglo-Saxon ancestry with complete substance use and imaging data. Subjects with a history of stroke or traumatic brain injury were excluded. Measurements Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and volumetric segmentation methods were used to estimate volume in seven subcortical ROIs: thalamus, caudate nucleus, putamen, pallidum, hippocampus, amygdala and nucleus accumbens. Substance use measurements included maximum nicotine and alcohol use, total life-time multi-substance use, maximum cannabis use in the young adults and regular cannabis use in the middle-aged males. Findings After correcting for multiple testing (P = 0.007), cannabis use was unrelated to any subcortical ROI. However, maximum nicotine use was associated with significantly smaller thalamus volumes in middle-aged males. Conclusions In exploratory analyses based on young adult and middle-aged samples, normal variation in cannabis use is unrelated statistically to individual differences in brain morphology as measured by subcortical volume.

AB  - Background Practice guidelines for childhood posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) recommend trauma-focused psychotherapies, mainly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is a brief trauma-focused, evidence-based treatment for PTSD in adults, but with few well-designed trials involving children and adolescents. Methods We conducted a single-blind, randomized trial with three arms (n = 103): EMDR (n = 43), Cognitive Behavior Writing Therapy (CBWT; n = 42), and wait-list (WL; n = 18). WL participants were randomly reallocated to CBWT or EMDR after 6 weeks; follow-ups were conducted at 3 and 12 months posttreatment. Participants were treatment-seeking youth (aged 8?18 years) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of PTSD (or subthreshold PTSD) tied to a single trauma, who received up to six sessions of EMDR or CBWT lasting maximally 45 min each. Results Both treatments were well-tolerated and relative to WL yielded large, intent-to-treat effect sizes for the primary outcomes at posttreatment: PTSD symptoms (EMDR: d = 1.27; CBWT: d = 1.24). At posttreatment 92.5% of EMDR, and 90.2% of CBWT no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. All gains were maintained at follow-up. Compared to WL, small to large (range d = 0.39?1.03) intent-to-treat effect sizes were obtained at posttreatment for negative trauma-related appraisals, anxiety, depression, and behavior problems with these gains being maintained at follow-up. Gains were attained with significantly less therapist contact time for EMDR than CBWT (mean = 4.1 sessions/140 min vs. 5.4 sessions/227 min). Conclusions EMDR and CBWT are brief, trauma-focused treatments that yielded equally large remission rates for PTSD and reductions in the severity of PTSD and comorbid difficulties in children and adolescents seeking treatment for PTSD tied to a single event. Further trials of both treatments with PTSD tied to multiple traumas are warranted.

AB  - Abstract Although existing research suggests that certain childhood traumas such as childhood sexual abuse are associated with interpersonal (e.g., marital) difficulties in adulthood, there has been limited research on interpersonal sequelae of other types of traumas. In addition, the association between childhood traumas and interpersonal outcomes has often been limited to a particular outcome such as divorce, and existing studies have rarely controlled for the co-occurrence of other traumas when evaluating interpersonal outcomes. The current study sought to evaluate the associations between 7 childhood traumas and 2 marital outcomes?marital disruption (i.e., divorce and separation) and marital satisfaction?in a large, national probability sample. Results from univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that (a) probability of marital disruption was higher among people who during childhood had experienced physical abuse, rape, or serious physical attack or assault; and (b) current marital satisfaction was lower among people who during childhood had experienced rape or sexual molestation. Results support the importance of childhood traumas in predicting 2 important marital outcomes.

AB  - Summary Fulminant hyperfibrinolysis has a mortality rate of 80-100% and requires early treatment with anti-fibrinolytics and fibrinogen. In cases of major trauma, rapid coagulation assessment and control are fundamental to successful patient management. Standard laboratory coagulation tests take time and are insufficient in describing Trauma-Induced Coagulopathy. Point-Of-Care (POC) tests such as ROTEM? (rotational thromboelastometry) and MULTIPLATE? (impedance aggregometry) can overcome these limitations and are effective as a guide to coagulation status and requirements for transfusion support. We report the successful POC management of fulminant hyperfibrinolysis after a hanging trauma in a man admitted to the Emergency Department.

AB  - Purpose? The incidence of abdominal stab wounds treated at the Royal Melbourne Hospital has noticeably increased over the 12 month period to March 2006, mirroring an increase in penetrating abdominal trauma throughout many Australian trauma centers. Management protocols for abdominal stab wounds are still contentious. The current study quantifies the increase in stab wounds at the Royal Melbourne Hospital over a 24 month period and analyzes the management and investigative modalities utilized. Methodology? A review of the Trauma Unit of the Royal Melbourne Hospital was performed for the period of March 20th 2004 until March 20th 2006. All anterior abdominal stab wounds were collated for the site of injury, investigations performed on admission, results of investigations, operations performed, and findings at operation. Results? There were 4244 emergency trauma presentations over the 24 months period between March 20th 2004 and March 20th 2006. The second 12 month period showed a 21.5% increase in overall trauma admissions and a 91.3% increase in anterior abdominal stabbings. The percentage of stab wounds treated conservatively fell by 21.8%, with the percentage of laparotomies increasing by 14.2%. Almost 30% of all patients undergoing surgery had no visceral injury at operation. Twenty CT scans were performed preoperatively, with a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 100%. Conclusion? Abdominal stab wounds treated at Royal Melbourne Hospital have substantially increased over the past 12 months. Whilst management is still contentious, a management protocol for anterior abdominal stab wounds is proposed, outlining the role of CT scanning, conservative management, laparoscopy and laparotomy

AB  - The clinical trial of a multi-channel cochlear prosthesis has been carried out on 10 profoundly-totally deaf adult patients. Speech perception tests have shown that all the patients received significant benefit from the device. They obtained improvements in understanding running speech from 47% to 550% when using the device in conjunction with lipreading compared to lipreading alone. With an open-set CID sentence test, three patients obtained scores showing an ability to understand speech without the need to lipread, and a further three patients had scores indicating they could also receive useful information without lipreading. In two patients, very limited open-set scores for electrical stimulation alone were obtained. This was most probably due to the fact that only a few channels of stimulation were possible due to cochlear disease, and they were therefore receiving information more like a single-channel device. The prosthesis has also been found to provide considerable help in hearing and recognizing everyday sounds.

AB  - Abstract Animal models of tinnitus allow us to study the relationship between changes in neural activity and the tinnitus percept. Here, guinea pigs were subjected to unilateral noise trauma and tested behaviourally for tinnitus 8 weeks later. By comparing animals with tinnitus with those without, all of which were noise-exposed, we were able to identify changes unique to the tinnitus group. Three physiological markers known to change following noise exposure were examined: spontaneous firing rates (SFRs) and burst firing in the inferior colliculus (IC), evoked auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), and the number of neurons in the cochlear nucleus containing nitric oxide synthase (NOS). We obtained behavioural evidence of tinnitus in 12 of 16 (75%) animals. Both SFRs and incidences of burst firing were elevated in the IC of all noise-exposed animals, but there were no differences between tinnitus and no-tinnitus animals. There were significant decreases in ipsilateral ABR latencies in tinnitus animals, contrary to what might be expected with a small hearing loss. Furthermore, there was an ipsilateral?contralateral asymmetry in NOS staining in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) that was only apparent in tinnitus animals. Tinnitus animals had a significantly greater number of NOS-containing neurons on the noise-exposed side, whereas no-tinnitus animals did not. These data suggest that measuring NOS in the VCN and recording ABRs supplement behavioural methods for confirming tinnitus in animals, and that nitric oxide is involved in plastic neural changes associated with tinnitus.

AB  - Abstract The brutal murder of James Byrd Jr. in June 1998 unleashed a storm of media, interest groups, high profile individuals and criticism on the Southeast Texas community of Jasper. The crime and subsequent response?from within the community as well as across the world?engulfed the entire town in a collective trauma. Using natural disaster literature/theory and employing an ecological approach, Jasper, Texas was investigated via an interrupted time series analysis to identify how the community changed as compared to a control community (Center, Texas) on crime, economic, health, educational, and social capital measures collected at multiple pre- and post-crime time points between 1995 and 2003. Differences-in-differences (DD) analysis revealed significant post-event changes in Jasper, as well as a surprising degree of resilience and lack of negative consequences. Interviews with residents conducted between March 2005 and 2007 identified how the community responded to the crisis and augmented quantitative findings with qualitative, field-informed interpretation. Interviews suggest the intervention of external organizations exacerbated the severity of the events. However, using strengths of specific local social institutions?including faith based, law enforcement, media, business sector and civic government organizations?the community effectively responded to the initial threat and to the potential negative ramifications of external entities.

AB  - Abstract: A pure electroporation injury leads to cell membrane disruption and subsequent osmotic swelling of the tissue. The state of water in the injured area of a tissue is changed and differs from a healthy tissue. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is very sensitive to the quality of the interaction between mobile (water) protons and a restricted (protein) proton pool, is therefore a useful tool to characterize this injury. Here, we present a protocol designed to measure the difference between the values of the transverse magnetic relaxation time (T2) in MRIs of healthy and electrically injured tissue. In addition, we present a method to evaluate the two main contributions to the MRI contrast, the degree of structural alteration of the cellular components (including a major contribution from membrane pores), and edema. The approach is useful in assessing the level of damage that electric shocks produce in muscle tissues, in that edema will resolve in time whereas structural changes require active repair mechanisms.

AB  - Summary An important aspect of firmwide risk discussed in this chapter is the firmwide scenario analysis and stress testing. While previous chapters of this book have introduced many methodologies for stress testing special techniques the attention is now focused on the firmwide stress testing. Firmwide risk scenario model approaches, and how the models can be used in practice for both the traditional firmwide risk analysis as well as in the regulatory mandated firmwide stress testing, are discussed. The traditional firmwide stress testing approach focuses on sufficient risk capacity, such as capital, under stress. The new regulatory- stress testing, such as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review and European Banking Authority stress tests, is different. In particular, it is focused on making banks retain capital adequacy and remain financially viable even under stress. The chapter ends with a view on the evolution of firmwide stress testing.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To report the experience of three highly specialized centres in the vascular evaluation of erectile dysfunction (ED) in teenagers, as there is little information on this topic, and although clinical guidelines support the use of vascular studies in selected cases, our experience is that vascular evaluation aimed at diagnosing organic ED is uncommon in teenagers, and most are designated as having psychogenic ED. PATIENTS AND METHODS In a retrospective multi-institutional analysis of three ED databases (1998?2003) we assessed males aged ≤19?years presenting with ED. The review of these databases focused on demographic characteristics, risk factors for ED, erectile function, results of vascular evaluation, and the causes of ED. RESULTS In all, 40 males aged 14?19?years were identified. The mean (range) duration of ED at presentation was 22.6?(4?84)?months. The major risk factors for ED were antecedent perineal trauma (37%) and penile trauma or surgery (15%). The mean (sd) International Index of Erectile Function ?erectile function? domain score was 15?(4). Information obtained by history taking was not predictive of the cause of ED. Vascular studies were performed in 62% of the patients and 48% of these patients were found to have an underlying vascular pathology; 42% of the latter group were found to be possible candidates for surgical intervention and another 16% needed further angiographic evaluation. CONCLUSION ED in teenagers should not be routinely categorized as psychogenic without an adequate vascular evaluation, as a significant percentage have abnormal erectile haemodynamics consistent with vasculogenic ED.

AB  - Background It is unknown how traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). One potential mechanism is via alteration of fear-learning processes that could affect responses to trauma memories and cues. We utilized a prospective, longitudinal design to determine if TBI is associated with altered fear learning and extinction, and if fear processing mediates effects of TBI on PTSD symptom change. Methods Eight hundred fifty two active-duty Marines and Navy Corpsmen were assessed before and after deployment. Assessments included TBI history, PTSD symptoms, combat trauma and deployment stress, and a fear-potentiated startle task of fear acquisition and extinction. Startle response and self-reported expectancy and anxiety served as measures of fear conditioning, and PTSD symptoms were measured with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. Results Individuals endorsing ?multiple hit? exposure (both deployment TBI and a prior TBI) showed the strongest fear acquisition and highest fear expression compared to groups without multiple hits. Extinction did not differ across groups. Endorsing a deployment TBI was associated with higher anxiety to the fear cue compared to those without deployment TBI. The association of deployment TBI with increased postdeployment PTSD symptoms was mediated by postdeployment fear expression when recent prior-TBI exposure was included as a moderator. TBI associations with increased response to threat cues and PTSD symptoms remained when controlling for deployment trauma and postdeployment PTSD diagnosis. Conclusions Deployment TBI, and multiple-hit TBI in particular, are associated with increases in conditioned fear learning and expression that may contribute to risk for developing PTSD symptoms.

AB  - Massive transfusion is a common consequence of major haemorrhage in the trauma patient. It affects the entire process of care, both for the clinicians involved in the patient's care and for the blood bank, given the consequences and complications of transfusions. This article will highlight the pathophysiology leading to the need for massive transfusion and provide some modern surgical approaches to decrease the transfusion requirement and lessen its effect on the individual patient. Practical suggestions for a massive transfusion protocol, based on our experience and the available literature will be provided. Finally the article will examine the complications of a massive transfusion and outline the steps in the prevention and management of these complications.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study investigates the clinical dogma that very high doses of methylprednisolone helpful in spinal cord injury are also helpful in optic nerve trauma. Methods: The right optic nerve of 29 male rats received a 5 second traumatic crush followed 30 minutes later by one of five intravenous treatments (methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, 90 mg/kg, 120 mg/kg, or saline). Treatment was continued for three additional administrations at 6 hour intervals. Untreated sham controls (n = 7) were also prepared. Six weeks after injury, animals were sacrificed, perfused and optic nerves systematically counted. RESULTS: Axon counts (means +/? s.e.m.) were as follows: Saline = 16,670 +/? 8,900 (n = 5); Methylprednisolone: 30 mg/kg = 8,098 +/? 4,741 (n = 5); 60 mg/kg = 6,925 +/? 6,517 (n = 4); 90 mg/kg = 2,663 +/? 2,653 (n = 4); 120 mg/kg = 6,149 +/? 3,487 (n = 6). Consequently, the data revealed that saline treated animals retained more axons than those that were administered methylprednisolone (p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that methylprednisolone exacerbates axonal loss following crush injury in the rat optic nerve. Based on the results of this study, clinical studies of traumatic optic neuropathy in the future should also examine the possibility that corticosteroid treatment may have an adverse effect on visual outcome following optic nerve trauma.

AB  - Objectives: To compare the value of different magnetic resonance sequences in the detection of brain lesions in dogs with multi-focal intracranial neurolocalised lesions and abnormal cisternal cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Methods: T2-weighted, T1-weighted, T1-weighted-Gd, FLAIR (fluid attenuated inversion recovery) images of 73 dogs with multi-focal intracranial localised lesions were reviewed retrospectively. Control dogs (19) were selected on the basis of normal neurological examination, magnetic resonance images and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Two board-certified radiologists blindly reviewed the magnetic resonance images. Magnetic resonance sequence sensitivities were compared using the chi-squared test and logistic regression, accounting for clustering at the patient level. Statistical significance was set at the 5 per cent level. Results: The FLAIR sequence was found to have the highest sensitivity (84 per cent, 61 of 73), followed by T2-weighted (63 per cent, 46 of 73), T1-weighted postcontrast (62 per cent, 45 of 73) and T1-weighted (23 per cent, 17 of 73) (P<0·001). FLAIR images were 106·1 times (95 per cent confidence interval 25·2 to 447·5) more likely to correctly identify cerebrospinal fluid-positive patients than T1-weighted, 6·4 times (95 per cent confidence interval 2·2 to 18·2) than T1-weighted postcontrast and 5·8 times (95 per cent confidence interval 2·0 to 16·4) than T2-weighted. FLAIR identified 14 per cent of cases that were classified as normal based on the three others sequences. Clinical Significance: Routine use of FLAIR sequence should be encouraged in dogs undergoing a brain magnetic resonance imaging and probably more specifically in cases of suspected inflammatory brain disease.
