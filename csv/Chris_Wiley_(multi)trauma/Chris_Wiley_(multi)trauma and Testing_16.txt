AB  - PURPOSE: This study investigates the clinical dogma that very high doses of methylprednisolone helpful in spinal cord injury are also helpful in optic nerve trauma. Methods: The right optic nerve of 29 male rats received a 5 second traumatic crush followed 30 minutes later by one of five intravenous treatments (methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, 90 mg/kg, 120 mg/kg, or saline). Treatment was continued for three additional administrations at 6 hour intervals. Untreated sham controls (n = 7) were also prepared. Six weeks after injury, animals were sacrificed, perfused and optic nerves systematically counted. RESULTS: Axon counts (means +/? s.e.m.) were as follows: Saline = 16,670 +/? 8,900 (n = 5); Methylprednisolone: 30 mg/kg = 8,098 +/? 4,741 (n = 5); 60 mg/kg = 6,925 +/? 6,517 (n = 4); 90 mg/kg = 2,663 +/? 2,653 (n = 4); 120 mg/kg = 6,149 +/? 3,487 (n = 6). Consequently, the data revealed that saline treated animals retained more axons than those that were administered methylprednisolone (p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that methylprednisolone exacerbates axonal loss following crush injury in the rat optic nerve. Based on the results of this study, clinical studies of traumatic optic neuropathy in the future should also examine the possibility that corticosteroid treatment may have an adverse effect on visual outcome following optic nerve trauma.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability and is a risk factor for the later development of neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Many models of TBI have been developed, but their further refinement and a more detailed long-term follow-up is needed. We have used the Thy1-YFP-H transgenic mouse line and the parallel rod floor test to produce an unbiased and robust method for the evaluation of the multiple effects of a validated model of controlled cortical injury. This approach reveals short- and long-term progressive changes, including compromised biphasic motor function up to 85 days post-lesion, which correlates with neuronal atrophy, dendrite and spine loss, and long-term axonal pathology evidenced by axon spheroids and fragmentation. Here we present methods for inducing a controlled cortical injury in the Thy1-YFP-H transgenic mouse line and for evaluating the resulting deficits in the parallel rod floor test. This technique constitutes a new, unbiased, and robust method for the evaluation of motor and behavioral alterations after TBI. ? 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective. Assessment of apolipoprotein E genotype, serum cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels in different types of dementia. Subjects. 102 consecutive referrals to an old age psychiatry service based at Manchester were classified according to clinical criteria based on ICD 10. Results. Thirty-seven were considered to have Alzheimer's disease, 16 multi-infarct dementia and 33 to be free from dementia. Sixteen patients, in whom a definitive diagnosis could not be reached or sufficient information was not available, were excluded from the study. There was an increase in the prevalence of the Apo E4 allele in both Alzheimer's disease (?2=3.82, p<0.05) and multi-infarct dementia (?2=1.93, p<0.16) by Wald tests compared to individuals without dementia. The increased prevalence of the E4 Allele in multi-infarct dementia was not related to serum lipid levels. Conclusion. The hypothesis that the onset of multi-infarct dementia may be precipitated by E4's mediation of higher serum cholesterol levels is not supported by the present study. ? 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Most common human diseases are a result from the combined effect of genes, the environmental factors, and their interactions such that including gene?environment (GE) interactions can improve power in gene mapping studies. The standard strategy is to test the SNPs, one-by-one, using a regression model that includes both the SNP effect and the GE interaction. However, the SNP-by-SNP approach has serious limitations, such as the inability to model epistatic SNP effects, biased estimation, and reduced power. Thus, in this article, we develop a kernel machine regression framework to model the overall genetic effect of a SNP-set, considering the possible GE interaction. Specifically, we use a composite kernel to specify the overall genetic effect via a nonparametric function andwe model additional covariates parametrically within the regression framework. The composite kernel is constructed as a weighted average of two kernels, one corresponding to the genetic main effect and one corresponding to the GE interaction effect. We propose a likelihood ratio test (LRT) and a restricted likelihood ratio test (RLRT) for statistical significance. We derive a Monte Carlo approach for the finite sample distributions of LRT and RLRT statistics. Extensive simulations and real data analysis show that our proposed method has correct type I error and can have higher power than score-based approaches under many situations.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides a review of the research on those treatments for childhood trauma deemed 'Well-Supported by Research Evidence' or 'Supported by Research Evidence' by the California Evidence-Based Clearinghouse for Child Welfare (CEBC). Trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT), a well-supported treatment originally designed for families impacted by child sexual abuse or violence, is explored in greater detail as this model has the strongest evidence base among treatments for childhood trauma with effectiveness documented in over 50 scientific studies, including 20 randomised trials. TF-CBT is a components-based, hybrid approach to treating children who have experienced trauma and their non-offending caregivers. Psychoeducation about TF-CBT helps caregivers and children have a general understanding of what treatment will entail and how it will address the trauma symptoms experienced.

AB  - Abstract Infection remains the Achilles heel of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy. However, an optimal antimicrobial surgical infection prophylaxis (SIP) regimen has not been established. This study evaluated the efficacy of a single-drug SIP compared to a multi-drug SIP on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing continuous-flow LVAD (CF-LVAD) and pulsatile LVAD (P-LVAD) implantation. An electronic search was performed to identify studies in the English literature on SIP regimens in patients undergoing LVAD implantation. Identified articles were assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Fourteen articles with 1,311 (CF-LVAD: 888; P-LVAD: 423) patients were analyzed. Overall, 501 (38.0%) patients received single-drug SIP, whereas 810 (62.0%) received multi-drug SIP. Time to infection was comparable between groups. There was no significant difference in overall incidence of LVAD-specific infections [single-drug: 18.7% vs. multi-drug: 24.8%, P = 0.49] including driveline infections [single-drug: 14.1% vs. multi-drug: 20.8%, P = 0.37]. Compared to single-drug SIP, patients who received multi-drug SIP had a significantly lower survival rate [single-drug: 90.0% vs. multi-drug: 76.0%, P = 0.01] and infection-free survival rate [single-drug: 88.4% vs. multi-drug: 77.3%, P = 0.04] at 90 days. However, there were no significant differences in 1-year survival and 1-year infection-free survival between groups. No survival differences were observed in the CF-LVAD subset as well. This study demonstrated no additional advantage of a multi-drug compared to a single-drug regimen for SIP. Although there was a modest advantage in early survival among CF-LVAD and P-LVAD patients who received single-drug SIP, there were no significant differences in the 1-year survival and 1-year infection-free survival.

AB  - Although uncommon, and despite the modern in diagnostic tools and therapeutic alternatives, retrohepatic and main hepatic veins injury remains associated with high mortality rate. Preoperative diagnosis is uncommon, and bullet trajectory may be a helpful sign in penetrating trauma patients. Patients and Methods? Hospital records of patients sustaining retroheptic vena cava (RHVC) injury were retrospectively reviewed as to diagnosis, associated injuries, injury characteristics, surgical management, and outcome, last ten years. Results? Eight male, 17 to 45 (mean 27.5) years-old patients sustaining RHVC injury were reviewed. Mean trauma indexes for the 8 cases were: ISS 36.6, RTS 7.55 and TRISS 89.0; and for the group who died: ISS 41.6, RTS 7.18, and TRISS 80.5. Two patients had sustained blunt trauma (one died), and six had penetrating injuries (two died). The injury diagnosis was achieved during surgery in all cases. A transfixing RHV injury occurred in 4 (50% of the) patients, and was found in all the 3 patients who died. An atriocaval shunt was employed in four patients, 3 of them had with transfixing injury with two deaths. The number of associated injuries was higher in the patients who died. Overall mortality rate was 37.5%. Comments? Despite advances in image diagnosis, injuries to RHVC are frequently diagnosed during surgery. Tangential injuries were managed with direct approach and sutures, and to control blending in transfixing injuries, were managed with atriocaval shunts, before suture. Conclusion? Despite improvements in its diagnosis and management, RHVC injuries remain with a high mortality rate, mainly when transfixing, and associated with numerous associated injuries.

AB  - Abstract Background: Provision of enteral nutrition (EN) support is historically inadequate in the critically ill population. An interdisciplinary approach utilizing various strategies has been shown to improve initiation of timely EN support. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the implementation of a series of interventions led by an interdisciplinary team was associated with changes in the initiation of nutrition support in a level 1 trauma center. Methods: Patients admitted between 2009 and 2013 with isolated closed head trauma injuries were identified through the hospital?s trauma center database. The initial population consisted of 159 patients; after exclusion criteria, 141 patients were included in the statistical analyses. Two statistical analyses were conducted. The first calculated the average days to the initiation of nutrition start by admission year. The second estimated the association between admission year and time to nutrition initiation with a generalized linear model. Results: Time to initiate nutrition therapy was estimated to decrease by 1.46 days (47.31%) from 2009 to 2013. The time to initiate nutrition in 2013 was 1.63 days. A significant association was found between the time to initiate nutrition and the 2012 and 2013 binary variables while controlling for confounding variables. The time frame was estimated to be 1.09 (P = .008) and 1.75 (P = .000) days shorter in 2012 and 2013 relative to 2009. Conclusions: An interdisciplinary effort utilizing multiple strategies identified and addressed barriers, resulting in a reduction of variability and a proactive approach to early EN.

AB  - Purpose: To provide guidance for managing the problem of missing data in clinical studies of trauma in order to decrease bias and increase the validity of findings for subsequent use. Organizing Construct: A thoughtful approach to missing data is an essential component of analysis to promote the clear interpretation of study findings. Methods: Integrative review of relevant biostatistics, medical and nursing literature, and case exemplars of missing data analyses using multiple linear regression based upon data from the National Study on the Costs and Outcomes of Trauma (NSCOT) was used as an example. Findings and Conclusions: In studies of traumatically injured people, multiple imputed values are often superior to complete case analyses that might have significant bias. Multiple imputation can improve accuracy of the assessment and might also improve precision of estimates. Sensitivity analyses which implements repeated analyses using various scenarios may also be useful in providing information supportive of further inquiry . This stepwise approach of missing data could also be valid in studies with similar types or patterns of missing data. Clinical Relevance: In interpreting and applying findings of studies with missing data, clinicians need to ensure that researchers have used appropriate methods for handling this issue. If suitable methods were not employed, nurse clinicians need to be aware that the findings may be biased.

AB  - Abstract Objective This study examined the relationship between sexual trauma and eating disorder behavior, taking into account the effects of developmental stage of the victim and the effects of multiple sexual assaults. Method Four groups of adult women took part in this study. Subjects were either victims of childhood sexual abuse, victims of rape in adulthood, victims of both childhood sexual abuse and rape, and controls who were not traumatized sexually. All subjects were assessed with semistructured interviews and self-report inventories that assessed eating disorder behavior, general psychopathology, and impulsivity. Results Victims of childhood sexual abuse differed from controls on measures of eating disorder behavior and individuals who had experienced both childhood sexual abuse and rape in adulthood were most likely to display eating disorder-related psychopathology. Victims of childhood sexual abuse also distinguished themselves with high levels of eating disorder behavior plus multiple forms of impulsive self-destructive behavior. Discussion This study provides additional support for the association between childhood sexual abuse and eating disorder behavior. Childhood sexual abuse may be particularly linked to the presence of binge eating behavior and several other forms of impulsive self-destructive behavior. ? 2001 by John Wiley and Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of canine brain diseases are often nonspecific. Single- and multi-voxel spectroscopy techniques allow quantification of chemical biomarkers for tissues of interest and may help to improve diagnostic specificity. However, published information is currently lacking for the in vivo performance of these two techniques in dogs. The aim of this prospective, methods comparison study was to compare the performance of single- and multi-voxel spectroscopy in the brains of eight healthy, juvenile dogs using 3 Tesla MRI. Ipsilateral regions of single- and multi-voxel spectroscopy were performed in symmetric regions of interest of each brain in the parietal (n = 3), thalamic (n = 2), and piriform lobes (n = 3). In vivo single-voxel spectroscopy and multi-voxel spectroscopy metabolite ratios from the same size and multi-voxel spectroscopy ratios from different sized regions of interest were compared. No significant difference was seen between single-voxel spectroscopy and multi-voxel spectroscopy metabolite ratios for any lobe when regions of interest were similar in size and shape. Significant lobar single-voxel spectroscopy and multi-voxel spectroscopy differences were seen between the parietal lobe and thalamus (P = 0.047) for the choline to N-acetyl aspartase ratios when large multi-voxel spectroscopy regions of interest were compared to very small multi-voxel spectroscopy regions of interest within the same lobe; and for the N-acetyl aspartase to creatine ratios in all lobes when single-voxel spectroscopy was compared to combined (pooled) multi-voxel spectroscopy datasets. Findings from this preliminary study indicated that single- and multi-voxel spectroscopy techniques using 3T MRI yield comparable results for similar sized regions of interest in the normal canine brain. Findings also supported using the contralateral side as an internal control for dogs with brain lesions.

AB  - Abstract The effectiveness of a locally developed trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT) program for maltreated children with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was examined across different therapists in a child protection clinic setting. An earlier phase of the research piloting the program had provided promising results. This second phase involved two studies evaluating the completed TF-CBT manual delivered by (a) the developer and (b) other therapists. A single-case multiple-baseline design was used to demonstrate the controlling effects of the treatment on PTSD symptoms and child coping. Eight 9?13-year-old abused children with PTSD were treated. Positive outcomes support the effectiveness of the TF-CBT program delivered by both the developer and other therapists. The study design and methodology were robust enough to confirm empirically the clinically beneficial effects and potential for this new program. It was also apparent, however, from study limitations, including missing data for some patients, that there are a number of challenges in carrying out such research in a busy child protection service setting with multiply-abused patients. This paper considers implications and ways forward for engaging in empirically supported practice as well as future development and research.

AB  - Abstract Background: Blast injury is uncommon, and remains poorly understood by most clinicians outside regions of active warfare. Primary blast injury (PBI) results from the interaction of the blast wave with the body, and typically affects gas-containing organs such as the ear, lungs and gastrointestinal tract. This review investigates the mechanisms and injuries sustained to the abdomen following blast exposure. Methods: MEDLINE was searched using the keywords ?primary blast injury?, ?abdominal blast? and ?abdominal blast injury? to identify English language reports of abdominal PBI. Clinical reports providing sufficient data were used to calculate the incidence of abdominal PBI in hospitalized survivors of air blast, and in open- and enclosed-space detonations. Results: Sixty-one articles were identified that primarily reported clinical or experimental abdominal PBI. Nine clinical reports provided sufficient data to calculate an incidence of abdominal PBI; 31 (3·0 per cent) of 1040 hospitalized survivors of air blast suffered abdominal PBI, the incidence ranging from 1·3 to 33 per cent. The incidence for open- and enclosed-space detonations was 5·6 and 6·7 per cent respectively. The terminal ileum and caecum were the most commonly affected organs. Surgical management of abdominal PBI is similar to that of abdominal trauma of other causes. Conclusion: Abdominal PBI is uncommon but has the potential for significant mortality and morbidity, which may present many days after blast exposure. It is commoner after blast in enclosed spaces and under water. Copyright ? 2010 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - A nine-month-old puppy was presented for investigation of seizures. Neurological deficits were found localising to the prosencephalon, mesencephalon and myelencephalon. Magnetic resonance imaging identified multiple, large lesions involving both cerebral hemispheres. Management with antiepileptic and immunomodulatory drugs was instituted; however, the seizures became progressively refractory and the puppy was euthanased. Histopathology following post-mortem examination found a mixed glial cell tumour with discrete areas where neoplastic cells appeared oligodendroglial or astrocytic. Primary intracranial neoplasia is a rare cause of neurological disease in young dogs. Moreover, this case is unusual in terms of both the mixed glial nature of the neoplasm and also its multi-focal distribution.

AB  - Abstract Electric pulp testing (EPT) has been available for more than a century and used in dental practices worldwide. This article provides an overview of this diagnostic aid. The PubMed database from 1953 was used initially; the reference list for pulp testing featured 1071 articles, and for EPT identified 121 papers. A forward search was undertaken on these articles and using selected author names. Potentially relevant material was also sought in contemporary endodontic texts, while older textbooks on endodontics, operative dentistry and pain revealed historic information and primary research not found electronically. A short account of the innervation of the pulp is followed by an historic overview. Clinical considerations discussed include tooth isolation, glove wearing and tester electrode placement. Orthodontic treatment, pacemaker wearing and patient medications are considered. Research applications are also discussed. While EPT is valuable, no single pulp testing technique can reliably diagnose all pulp conditions. Careful collection of patient history regarding the problem tooth and prudent use of appropriate radiographs are also helpful. The shortcomings of electric tests, especially in the case of immature and concussed teeth, must be understood. The demeanour of the patient and the responses given by control teeth also require careful consideration.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aim Patients suffering dental trauma are unprepared for the disability challenge and necessary rehabilitation, while a traumatic event places an expanded demand on the dentist who is focused on treating disease. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of traumatic dental injuries (TDI) on patients and to compare patients? and dentists? perceptions of the event. Material and methods TDI patients (aged ≥ 21 years) attending a tertiary dental hospital from 2011 to 2013, and their dentists were recruited with informed consent. An exploratory sequential mixed-methods design was adopted. The Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) quantitatively identified patients with ?very often,? ?fairly often? or ?occasionally? in at least one of the OHIP-14 questions (Phase 1) to participate in the qualitative phase of the study through focus group discussions (FGD) (Phase 2). FGD for dentists was conducted separately. Results Quantitative analysis showed 28%-55% of TDI patients had ?occasional? to ?very often? discomfort during eating, increased self-consciousness and embarrassment. Qualitative analysis showed patients were concerned with aesthetic disability, treatment cost and potential tooth loss but overcame their negative outlook and accepted prescribed protective measures. Dentists appreciated patients? concerns about aesthetics and functional disruptions but were less attuned to patients? sense of guilt and fear of judgement. Conclusions TDI exert functional, psychological and social impacts on patients. Patients? and dentists? perspectives were useful for understanding the need for continuity of care, and the findings could contribute to effective TDI management.

AB  - Abstract Limited data suggest that enhanced self-knowledge from genetic information related to non-medical traits can have a positive impact on psychological well-being. Deaf individuals undertake genetic testing for deaf genes to increase self-knowledge. Because deafness is considered a non-medical trait by many individuals, we hypothesized that deaf individuals receiving a genetic explanation for why they are deaf will experience increased psychological well-being. We report results from a prospective, longitudinal study to determine the impact of genetic testing (GJB2, Cx26; GJB6, Cx30) on perceived personal control (PPC), anxiety, and depression in deaf adults (N?=?209) assessed following pre-test genetic counseling as well as 1-month and 6-months following test result disclosure. Participants were classified as Cx positive (n?=?82) or Cx negative/inconclusive (n?=?127). There was significant evidence for Cx group differences in PPC and anxiety over time (PPC: Cx group*time interaction p?=?0.0007; anxiety: Cx group*time interaction p?=?0.002), where PPC scores were significantly higher, and anxiety scores were significantly lower for the Cx positive group relative to the negative/inconclusive group following test result disclosure. Compared to pre-test, PPC scores increased at 1-month (p?=?0.07) and anxiety scores decreased at 6-months (p?=?0.03) for the Cx positive group. In contrast, PPC scores decreased (p?=?0.009, p?<?0.0001) and anxiety scores increased (p?=?0.09, p?=?0.02) for the Cx negative/inconclusive group at 1- and 6-months post test result disclosure. Genetic testing for deaf genes affects the psychological well-being of deaf individuals. Increasing deaf adults? access to genetic testing may potentially enhance self-knowledge and increase psychological well-being for those who receive a genetic explanation, which could offer downstream health benefits.

AB  - Compelling evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation play a role in stress regulation and in the etiologic basis of stress related disorders such as Post traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Here we describe the purpose and methods of an international consortium that was developed to study the role of epigenetics in PTSD. Inspired by the approach used in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, we brought together investigators representing seven cohorts with a collective sample size of N?=?1147 that included detailed information on trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, and genome-wide DNA methylation data. The objective of this consortium is to increase the analytical sample size by pooling data and combining expertise so that DNA methylation patterns associated with PTSD can be identified. Several quality control and analytical pipelines were evaluated for their control of genomic inflation and technical artifacts with a joint analysis procedure established to derive comparable data over the cohorts for meta-analysis. We propose methods to deal with ancestry population stratification and type I error inflation and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of applying robust error estimates. To evaluate our pipeline, we report results from an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of age, which is a well-characterized phenotype with known epigenetic associations. Overall, while EWAS are highly complex and subject to similar challenges as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we demonstrate that an epigenetic meta-analysis with a relatively modest sample size can be well-powered to identify epigenetic associations. Our pipeline can be used as a framework for consortium efforts for EWAS.
