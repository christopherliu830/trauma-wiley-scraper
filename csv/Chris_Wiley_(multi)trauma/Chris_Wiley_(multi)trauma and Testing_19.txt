AB  - Abstract Background/Aim Little is known about adult dental trauma experience at the population level. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and associations of dental injuries in New Zealand (NZ) adults. Materials and Method Information about dental and orofacial trauma in a representative sample of NZ adults (aged 18-94) was collected in a national oral health survey. As well as self-reported information, the maxillary six anterior teeth were examined for signs of dental trauma. Survey weights were used. Results Of the 40.9% (95% CI: 37.6, 44.2) who reported previous orofacial trauma, 69.1% (95% CI: 64.3, 73.5), or just over one-quarter of the sample, reported that this included a dental injury. More males than females had experienced orofacial trauma (51.3% [95% CI: 45.8, 56.8] and 31.4% [95% CI: 27.9, 35.1], respectively). The most common injury was a ?chipped or broken tooth? (66.6%, 95% CI: 60.6, 72.1). Almost three-quarters had sought treatment. Clinical examination revealed an overall trauma prevalence of 23.4% (95% CI: 21.0, 26.0) with more males than females affected. Some 14.9% (95% CI: 12.8, 17.2) had one injured tooth, while 6.5% (95% CI: 5.2, 8.1) had two injured teeth. The maxillary central incisors were the most frequently affected. Most participants with clinical signs of trauma had only one of the six maxillary teeth affected. The most common clinical dental trauma observation was evidence of ?treatment? or an ?untreated enamel fracture?, and these were more common among males and those aged 35-44 years. Conclusion Traumatic dental injuries constitute an important public health issue. More emphasis on preventing them in the NZ adult population is warranted, and public awareness of State-funded cover for dental injuries may need to be bolstered to enable equitable access for injury care. Overall, a greater emphasis on prevention and the importance of initial care for dental injuries could reduce the individual and societal burden.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the clinical outcomes of anterior and posterior instrumentation with different debridement and graft fusion methods for multi-level contiguous thoracic spinal tuberculosis. Methods We retrospectively evaluated 81 patients with multi-level contiguous thoracic spinal tuberculosis who underwent anterior or posterior instrumentation combined with different methods of debridement, decompression, and graft fusion from January 2002 to December 2012. All patients were divided into an anterior instrumentation group and a posterior instrumentation group. In the anterior instrumentation group, there were 39 patients who underwent transthoracic debridement. In the posterior instrumentation group, there were 34 patients who underwent trans-costotransverse decompression and strut grafting with posterior instrumentation, and another 8 patients underwent combined anterior debridement and strut grafting with posterior instrumentation in a single-stage or two-stage procedure. The kyphotic angles were calculated from lateral spinal X-rays using the modified Konstam method. The symptoms and signs of tuberculosis, fusion level, fusion time of the bone graft, average kyphosis angle, average correction, average loss of correction, and clinical complications were recorded. The average follow-up period was 37?months (range, 17?72?months). Results The cohort consisted of 47 males and 34 females with an average age of 38?years. The mean durations of the operations were 3.5 ± 0.4?h in the anterior group and 4.0 ± 0.3?h in the posterior group ( P < 0.05). The mean blood loss volumes during surgery were 450 ± 42 and 560 ± 51?mL for the anterior group and the posterior group, respectively ( P < 0.01). The kyphotic deformities were corrected from 32.1° ± 10.3° to 10.2° ± 2.1° in the anterior group and from 33.8° ± 11.7° to 12.6° ± 2.7° in the posterior group ( P < 0.01). The neurologic statuses of the 23 patients with preoperative neurologic deficits improved in each group. Fusion was confirmed radiographically at 5.4 ± 1.2?months (range, 4?12?months) in the anterior group and 5.6 ± 1.4?months (range, 4?13?months) in the posterior group ( P > 0.05). Postoperative relapses were noted in 1 and 3 patients in the anterior and the posterior group, respectively. Conclusion Posterior instrumentation was more effective than anterior instrumentation in the correction of kyphosis and the maintenance of the correction. However, postoperative sinus formation was more frequent in patients who underwent a single-stage posterior procedure.

AB  - Summary: A multi-institutional study on the prognosis of patients with epilepsy was performed in Japan from 1975 to 1977, including 20 institutions. The outcome of epileptic seizures and social adjustment 10, 5, and 3 years after the onset of the illness was studied in three different groups of epileptic patients, respectively. The number of successfully followed-up cases was 1,868 in total, follow-up rate being 42%. The data were analyzed statistically by use of analysis of variance. The rate of remission of seizures in all was 58.3% and the rate of normal social adjustment 62.6%. The remission rate showed no significant difference among the 10-, 5-, and 3-year outcome groups. The study on the outcome of seizure control indicated that the prognosis of seizure control is more favorable (a) in idiopathic than in residual or symptomatic epileptics; (b) in patients with onset before 10 years of age than in those with onset after 10 years; (c) in patients with less frequent seizures; (d) in sleep epilepsy than in waking and diffuse epilepsies; (e) in patients who started treatment within 1 year of onset of seizure; (f) in patients with single-type partial seizures than in those with partial seizures combined with tonic-clonic seizures; (g) in patients without high grade EEG background abnormality; and (h) in patients without neurological symptoms, intellectual deficits, personality disturbances, or psychotic symptoms. Factors that determine the prognosis of social adjustment were almost similar to those for remission of seizures. There was a close correlation between the outcome of seizure control and that of social adjustment. Correlation coefficient between follow-up rate and remission rate in 15 of the 20 collaborated institutions was 0.55 (p < 0.05), showing a tendency that the remission rate becomes higher as the follow-up rate is raised. RÉSUMÉ Une étude collaborative multi-institutionnelle sur le pronostic des épilepsies a été effectuée au Japon de 1975 à 1977 dans 20 institutions différentes. Le devenir des crises et l'adaptation sociale ont été appréciés chez 3 groupes différents de patients 10 ans, 5 ans et 3 ans après le debut de la maladie. Le nombre des cas dont l'évolution a pu être suivie de façon satisfaisante est de 1868, ce qui répond à une proportion de 42%. Les données ont ete analysees statistiquement par analyse de variance. Le taux de rémission des crises a été au total de 58,3% et le taux d'adaptation sociale normale de 62,6%. Il n'a pas été noté de différence significative du taux de rémission entre les 3 groupes. En ce qui concerne le pronostic des crises, il s'est avéré meilleur: 1o chez les sujets qui présentent une épilepsie idiopathique (et non symptomatique); 2o chez ceux dont les crises sont apparues avant l'âge de 10 ans; 3o chez ceux dont le crises sont rares; 4o chez ceux dont les crises surviennent pendant le sommeil; 5o chez ceux qui ont débuté le traitement dans l'année qui a suivi le début des crises; 6o chez ceux qui présentent un seul type de crises partielles par rapport à ceux dont les crises partielles sont combinees à des crises tonicocloniques; 7o chez ceux dont les rythmes de fond EEG ne sont pas très anormaux; 8o chez ceux qui ne présentent pas de troubles neurologiques, de déficit intellectuel, de troubles de la personnalité ou de symptomes psychotiques. Les facteurs qui déterminent le pronostic de l'adaptation sociale sont à peu près les mêmes que ceux qui concernent la rémission des crises. Il y a d'ailleurs une étroite corrélation entre ces deux pronostics. Le coefficient de corrélation entre le taux de rémission et la durée de l'observation des sujets dans 15 des 20 institutions collaboratives est de 0,55 (p < 0,05) et exprime la tendance pour le taux de rémission d'être d'autant plus grand que la durée d'observation est prolongée. RESUMEN Entre los an?os 1975 y 1977 se realizó en Japón un estudio multi-institucional (abarcando 20 Centros) con objeto de establecer el pronóstico de pacientes con epilepsia. Se estudiaron le evolución de las crisis comiciales y la integración social en 3 grupos diferentes de pacientes epilepticos 10 años, 5 an?os y 3 an?os después del comienzo de la enfermedad. El número de casos seguidos con éxito fue 1.868 en total, siendo la tasa de seguimiento del 42%. Se analizaron estadísticamente los datos por medio del análisis de la varianza. La tasa de remisión de las crisis fue en total del 58,3% y la tasa de ajuste social del 62,6%. La tasa de remisión no mostró diferencias significativas en los grupos evolutivos de 10, 5 y 3 años. El estudio pronóstico reveló que el control de los ataques era más favorable en la epilepsyía idiopática que en la residual o sintomática; en pacientes con un comienzo de las crisis antes de los 10 años de edad que después; en pacientes con crisis menos frecuentes; en epilepsyía relacionada con el sueño que la que tenia lugar durante la vigilia o era difusa; en pacientes que empezaron tratamiento antes del año del inicio de los ataques; en enfermos con un único tipo de crisis parciales que en aquéllos que presentaban crisis parciales y tónico-clonicas; en pacientes sin anomalías groseras de la actividad de fondo en el EEG y en enfermos sin síntomas neurológicos, déficit intelectual, alteraciones de la personalidad o síntomas psicóticos. Los factores que determinaron el pronóstico en lo que respecta a ajuste social eran casi similares a los relacionados con la remisión de los ataques. Hubo una estrecha correlación entre el pronóstico del control de las crisis y el grado de ajuste social. El coeficiente de correlación entre la tasa de revisiones y la tasa de remisiones en 15 de los 20 Centros fue 0,55 (p< 0,05), mostrando una tendencia a que las remisiones fuesen mayores a medida que la tasa de re-evaluaciones aumenta. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Eine kollaborative Studie über die Prognose von Patienten mit Epilepsie wurde in Japan an 20 Institutionen von 1975 bis 1977 durchgeführt. Der Verlauf epileptischer Anfälle und die soziale Anpassung wurden 10 Jahre, 5 Jahre und 3 Jahre nach Beginn der Erkrankung in 3 verschiedenen Gruppen epileptischer Patienten untersucht. Insgesamt wurden 1868 Patienten erfolgreich verfolgt, das sind 42%. Die Daten wurden mit Hilfe der Varianz-analyse statistisch bearbeitet. Die Heilungsquote für alle Anfälle betrug 58,3%, die Rate der normalen sozialen Anpassung 62,6%. Die Heilungsquote zeigte keine deutlichen Unterschiede zwischen den Zehnjahres-, Fünfjahres- und Dreijahresergebnissen. Die Aufschlüsselung ergab, daß die Prognose hinsichtlich Anfallsfreiheit günstiger bei der idiopathischen als bei der residualen Oder symptomatischen Epilepsie ist; günstiger schneiden Patienten mit Anfallsbeginn vor dem Alter von 10 Jahren ab, Patienten mit seltenen Anfällen, Patienten mit Schlaf-Epilepsie verglichen mit Wachoder diffuser Epilepsie, Patienten, bei denen die Behandlung innerhalb eines Jahres nach erstem Anfall eingeleitet wurde, Patienten mit isolierten Herdanfällen als solche mit Partialanfällen kombiniert mit tonisch-klonischen Krämpfen, Patienten ohne hochgradige Hintergrundsveranderungen im EEG, Patienten ohne neurologische Symptome, intellektuelle Defekte, Verhaltungsstorungen oder psychotische Symptome. Die Faktoren, die die Prognose hinsichtlich der sozialen Eingliederung bestimmen, waren ähnlich denen, die eine Anfallsfreiheit entschieden. Der Korrelationskoeffizient zwischen der Verlaufsrate und der Anfallsfreiheit betrug bei 15 der 20 kolla-borierenden Institutionen 0,55 (p < 0,05). Er zeigt somit die Tendenz, daß die Anfallsfreiheit höher wird in dem Maße, in dem die Häufigkeit der Kontroll-untersuchungen zunimmt.

AB  - Objective To assess the association between parental post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and offspring PTSD and its specificity for other disorders in a non-clinical epidemiological cohort of Australian Vietnam veterans, their partners and their sons and daughters. Method Veterans were interviewed twice, in 1992?1994 and 2005?2006; partners were interviewed in 2006?2007, and their offspring in 2012?2014. A total of 125 sons and 168 daughters were interviewed from 197 families, 137 of which also included partners who were the mothers of the children. Statistical analysis used multi-level modelling to compute odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals while controlling for clustering effects within families. Parent PTSD diagnoses were examined for associations with offspring trauma exposure, PTSD and other psychiatric diagnoses. Results Veteran PTSD increased the risk of PTSD and no other disorder in both sons and daughters; partner PTSD did not. Veteran depression was also a risk factor for sons? PTSD, and alcohol disorder was linked to alcohol dependence in sons and PTSD in daughters, but not when controlling for veteran PTSD. Conclusion We conclude that PTSD in a Vietnam veteran father increases the risk specifically for PTSD in his sons and daughters.

AB  - BACKGROUND Despite countless advancements in trauma care a survivability gap still exists in the prehospital setting. Military studies clearly identify hemorrhage as the leading cause of potentially survivable prehospital death. Shifting resuscitation from the hospital to the point of injury has shown great promise in decreasing mortality among the severely injured. MATERIALS AND METHODS Our regional trauma network (Southwest Texas Regional Advisory Council) developed and implemented a multiphased approach toward facilitating remote damage control resuscitation. This approach required placing low-titer O+ whole blood (LTO+ WB) at helicopter emergency medical service bases, transitioning hospital-based trauma resuscitation from component therapy to the use of whole blood, modifying select ground-based units to carry and administer whole blood at the scene of an accident, and altering the practices of our blood bank to support our new initiative. In addition, we had to provide information and training to an entire large urban emergency medical system regarding changes in policy. RESULTS Through a thorough, structured program we were able to successfully implement point-of-injury resuscitation with LTO+ WB. Preliminary evaluation of our first 25 patients has shown a marked decrease in mortality compared to our historic rate using component therapy or crystalloid solutions. Additionally, we have had zero transfusion reactions or seroconversions. CONCLUSION Transfusion at the scene within minutes of injury has the potential to save lives. As our utilization expands to our outlying network we expect to see a continued decrease in mortality among significantly injured trauma patients.

AB  - The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire - Short Form (CTQ-SF) is widely used to measure childhood abuse of all types. In the present study, we examined the psychometric properties of the Norwegian version of the instrument. The participants constituted four subsamples (n = 517): substance abusers (n = 126), psychiatric patients (n = 210), prisoners (n = 109) and adolescents in out-of-home placements (n = 72). Confirmatory factor analysis revealed a reasonable fit of the data to the original five-factor structure of the CTQ-SF. Measurement invariance was found across gender and the four subsamples. It was concluded that the Norwegian version of the CTQ-SF has acceptable psychometric properties, with good reliability and satisfactory accuracy, to assess different dimensions of childhood trauma.

AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to assess the effects on counselors of working with sexual violence survivors. Members of a women psychologists? organization and a group of sexual violence counselors completed questionnaires regarding the extent of their work with survivors and their psychological functioning. Counselors who had a higher percentage of survivors in their caseload reported more disrupted beliefs, (particularly about the goodness of other people), more symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, and more self-reported vicarious trauma. Symptomatology was not related to counselors? own history of victimization. Qualitative data regarding difficult and enjoyable aspects of working with survivors also were gathered, along with data on the strategies used by counselors to cope with work-related stress. implications for counselor training are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Pain is one of the main complaints of trauma patients in (pre-hospital) emergency medicine. Significant deficiencies in pain management in emergency medicine have been identified. No evidence-based protocols or guidelines have been developed so far, addressing effectiveness and safety issues, taking the specific circumstances of pain management of trauma patients in the chain of emergency care into account. The aim of this systematic review was to identify effective and safe initial pharmacological pain interventions, available in the Netherlands, for trauma patients with acute pain in the chain of emergency care. Up to December 2011, a systematic search strategy was performed with MeSH terms and free text words, using the bibliographic databases CINAHL, PubMed and Embase. Methodological quality of the articles was assessed using standardized evaluation forms. Of a total of 2328 studies, 25 relevant studies were identified. Paracetamol (both orally and intravenously) and intravenous opioids (morphine and fentanyl) proved to be effective. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) showed mixed results and are not recommended for use in pre-hospital ambulance or (helicopter) emergency medical services [(H)EMS]. These results could be used for the development of recommendations on evidence-based pharmacological pain management and an algorithm to support the provision of adequate (pre-hospital) pain management. Future studies should address analgesic effectiveness and safety of various drugs in (pre-hospital) emergency care. Furthermore, potential innovative routes of administration (e.g., intranasal opioids in adults) need further exploration.

AB  - ABSTRACT Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) activity of platelets of an age- and sex-matched group of controls was compared with several groups of inpatients having non-familial dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT), Parkinson's disease (PD), multi-infarct dementia (MID), mixed types of these 3 diseases and a group of other central nervous system (CNS) organic disorders. All patients were subjected to several psychometric tests, including the Sandoz Clinical Assessment - Geriatric Scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Mini-Mental State Examination and the Organic Mental Disorder Scale (OMDS). A statistically significant enhancement of MAO-B activity could be observed in DAT patients and in PD patients, whereas the MID group showed a mean activity similar to that of the control group and the group with other organic CNS disorders. In DAT patients the degree of dementia in the OMDS test and the enhancement of MAO activity were positively correlated, but PD did not show such a correlation. It is concluded that the increase of MAO activity in PD and in DAT might be due to a disease-related enhanced affinity to oxygen and to such oxygen-derived radicals as superoxide or hydroxyl radicals. However, a possible drug-induced enhancement of MAO activity in PD cannot be excluded. Furthermore, the MAO-B activity values in platelets of individual patients or controls are not indicative of diagnosis or prognosis of any of these diseases and are of no disease-related specificity.

The patient developed fever and crusted, nodulo-ulcerative lesions of the skin after accidental superficial trauma to the forehead. The biopsy revealed suppurative granulomatous inflammation with intracellular and extracellular yeast-like cells with associated clear halo measuring 3?4 ?m in size. Systemic involvement was not found. The lesions cleared after treatment with itraconazole 200 mg twice a day for 3 weeks. The medication was continued for a total period of 3 months, with no signs of recurrence after one-year of follow-up.

Effects of a yoga breath intervention alone and in combination with an exposure therapy for PTSD and depression in survivors of the 2004 South-East Asia tsunami. Objective:? This study evaluated the effect of a yoga breath program alone and followed by a trauma reduction exposure technique on post-traumatic stress disorder and depression in survivors of the 2004 Asian tsunami. Method:? In this non-randomized study, 183 tsunami survivors who scored 50 or above on the Post-traumatic Checklist-17 (PCL-17) were assigned by camps to one of three groups: yoga breath intervention, yoga breath intervention followed by 3?8?h of trauma reduction exposure technique or 6-week wait list. Measures for post-traumatic stress disorder (PCL-17) and depression (BDI-21) were performed at baseline and at 6, 12 and 24?weeks. Data were analyzed using anova and mixed effects regression. Results:? The effect of treatment vs. control was significant at 6?weeks (F2,178?=?279.616, P?<?0.001): mean PCL-17 declined by 42.5?±?10.0 SD with yoga breath, 39.2?±?17.2 with Yoga breath?+?exposure and 4.6?±?13.2 in the control. Conclusion:? Yoga breath-based interventions may help relieve psychological distress following mass disasters.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction Strychnos nux-vomica L. (Loganiaceae), widely used in folk medicine, is grown extensively in southern Asian countries. Its major bioactive constituents are strychnine and brucine, which are frequently used in traditional herbal medicines for treatment of nervous diseases, vomiting and traumatic pain. Objective A new method using a carbon-paste electrode modified with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT/CPE) was developed and validated for single or simultaneous determination of strychnine and brucine in Strychnos nux-vomica seeds. Additionally, an environmentally friendly method was successfully applied to reduce the levels of strychnine and brucine in seeds. Materials and methods Cyclic voltammetry, chronocoulometry and differential pulse voltammetry were used with multi-walled carbon nanotube modified carbon-paste electrodes. Results The peak currents increase linearly with the strychnine and brucine concentrations in the ranges of 50?1000 and 5?355?µ m, and the detection limits for strychnine and brucine were 0.43 and 0.28?µ m, respectively. Of the processing methods used, the greatest reduction in the strychnine and brucine levels was observed in samples processed using milk and saltwater. Conclusion A new, sensitive and selective method was developed for the measurement of strychnine and brucine. This method was successfully applied to the determination of strychnine and brucine in unprocessed and processed Strychnos nux-vomica seed. Copyright ? 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Objective To evaluate outcome and adverse events following ventral stabilization of the atlantoaxial (AA) joint in dogs with clinical AA subluxation using screw/polymethymethacrylate (PMMA) constructs in a retrospective, multi-center cohort study. Study Design Historical cohort study. Animals 35 client-owned dogs. Methods Medical records from 3 institutions were reviewed to identify dogs with AA subluxation treated with ventral screw and PMMA constructs. Data on signalment, pre- and postoperative neurologic status, imaging performed, and adverse events were retrieved. Neurologic examination data were abstracted to generate a modified Frankel score at admission, discharge, and re-examination. Telephone interview of owners >180 days postoperative was conducted. Results Thirty-five dogs with AA subluxation treated with ventral screw/PMMA constructs were included. Most dogs were young (median age 1 year), small breed dogs with acute onset of neurologic signs (median duration 22.5 hours). Most dogs were non-ambulatory at the time of admission (median modified Frankel score 3). Adverse events were identified in 15/35 dogs including 9 dogs with major adverse events. Four dogs required a second surgery due to vertebral canal violation (n?=?2) or implant failure (n?=?2). Re-examination at 4?6 weeks postoperative reported 15/28 dogs with improved neurologic status and 19/28 dogs were ambulatory. Telephone follow-up was available for 23/35 dogs with 23/23 reported as ambulatory (median follow-up 390 days). Conclusions Ventral application of screw and PMMA constructs for AA subluxation, as described here, is associated with clinical improvement in the majority of dog. Major adverse events are infrequent and the technique is considered relatively safe.

AB  - Importance There is a paucity of evidence analysing the treatment of cyclodialysis clefts. Background We describe outcomes following the treatment of this rare condition at six centres internationally. Design Retrospective case series. Participants Thirty-six patients with a cyclodialysis cleft from 2003 to 2017 were recruited. Methods Clefts were treated with cycloplegic agents, laser therapy and/or surgery. Main Outcome Measures Postoperative best recorded visual acuity (BRVA), intraocular pressure (IOP) and the rate of cleft closure. Results The mean age was 45?±?17?years and 29 (80.6%) patients were male. One eye (2.8%) received only medical therapy, 5 (13.9%) received laser, 14 (38.9%) underwent surgery after laser failure and 16 (44.4%) eyes received exclusively surgery. Over 80% of eyes had a BRVA improvement of more than two lines. Closure was attained in 30 eyes (93.8%; n?=?32), with postoperative stabilized IOP?≥?12?mmHg in 29 eyes (80.6%; n?=?36) and postoperative BRVA ≤20/50 in 20 eyes (58.8%; n?=?34). Improved postoperative BRVA was related to better preoperative BRVA (P =?0.006) and preoperative IOP?≥?4?mmHg (P =?0.03). There was no significant difference between treatment approach for IOP?≥?12?mmHg (P =?0.85) or postoperative BRVA ≤20/50 (P =?0.80). Only two eyes at last follow-up required IOP lowering medication. Conclusions and Relevance There was a high closure rate with most eyes eventually requiring surgery. Clinically significant improvements in BRVA were found in most eyes. Improved postoperative BRVA was significantly related to better preoperative BRVA and IOP.

AB  - The sequelae of child maltreatment tend to extend current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. This study examined this assumption, hypothesizing that (a) PTSD and trauma-related symptoms are more severe after single trauma than after child maltreatment; (b) symptoms unrelated to trauma are more severe after child maltreatment than after single trauma; and (c) a comorbid association of clinical PTSD with trauma-related symptoms is more prevalent after single trauma, whereas a comorbid association of clinical PTSD with trauma unrelated symptoms is more prevalent after child maltreatment. The Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC) assessed PTSD and trauma-related symptoms in 256 children (83 children exposed to single trauma, 173 to child maltreatment). The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) assessed trauma-unrelated symptoms. Single-trauma children reported significantly more severe PTSD and trauma-related symptoms. Significantly more severe trauma unrelated symptoms were reported after child maltreatment. A significant relation was found between clinical PTSD and more severe trauma-related symptoms in both samples. Likelihood of children meeting PTSD symptoms after trauma seems to decrease when traumatization becomes more complex. Findings support our assumption that symptomatology of maltreated children extends current PTSD symptoms.

AB  - ABSTRACT Survival and causes of death of 218 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and of 115 patients with multi-infarct dementia (MID) were examined. The patients were originally found in a community-based epidemiological survey of dementia, and all patients with AD or MID alive on the prevalence day were included. The 6-years survival rate for AD was 21.1% vs. the expected rate 48.5%, that for MID 11.9% vs. 45.2% expected. A comparison of relative survival rates suggested that MID carries a less favorable survival prognosis than AD. The mean durations were: AD 5.7 years and MID 5.2 years; median duration being 5 years in both diseases. The excess mortality in both AD and MID was independent of age. In AD, the survival rate decreased with increasing severity of dementia, while in MID the mortality was the same regardless of the severity of the dementia. The dementia disorder was the underlying cause of death in 68% of AD patients, and in 38% of MID patients, bronchopneumonia being the most frequent immediate cause of death in both groups. As a cause of death, acute cerebrovascular accidents occurred more often in MID patients than in the general population of comparable age. Malignant diseases were less frequent as a cause of death in both dementia groups than in the general population.

AB  - ABSTRACT Patients with severe abdominal trauma injuries can have improved outcomes if a priority-oriented approach is taken to surgical intervention. This includes temporary abdominal closure and planned reoperation to complete complex, lengthy procedures when the patient is stabilized. Temporary abdominal closure can be achieved safely and cost-effectively by using a presterilized 3-liter cystoscopy fluid IV bag. This article discusses the rationale for temporary abdominal closure and planned reoperation, physiologic considerations in abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), abdominal injuries or conditions leading to ACS, and manifestations of ACS. It compares and contrasts various materials used for temporary abdominal closure, illustrates bag preparation and silo application and removal, and analyzes complex intraoperative and postoperative nursing activities.
