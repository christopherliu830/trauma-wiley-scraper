AB  - This study was undertaken to determine if, amongst civilian trauma patients requiring massive transfusion (MT), the use of a formal trauma transfusion pathway (TTP), in comparison with transfusion without a TTP, is associated with a reduction in mortality, or changes in indices of coagulation, blood product utilisation and complications. A systematic review of three bibliographic databases, reference lists and conference proceedings was conducted. Studies were included if comparisons were made between patients receiving transfusion with and without a TTP. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers on population characteristics, transfusion strategies, blood product utilisation, indices of coagulation, clinical outcomes and complications. Data were pooled using a random effects model and heterogeneity explored. Seven observational studies met all eligibility criteria. Amongst 1801 patients requiring MT, TTPs were associated with a significant reduction in mortality (RR 0·69, 95% CI 0·55, 0·87). No significant increase in the mean number of PRBC transfused between TTP and control patients was seen (MD ?1·17 95% CI ?2·70, 0·36). When studies assessing only trauma patients were considered, TTPs were associated with a reduction in the mean number of units of plasma transfused (MD ?2·63, 95% CI ?4·24, ?1·01). In summary, the use of TTPs appears to be associated with a reduction in mortality amongst trauma patients requiring MT without a clinically significant increase in the number of PRBC transfused and a potential reduction in plasma transfusion. Effects of TTPs on platelet transfusion, indices of coagulation and complications remain unclear. A randomised controlled trial is warranted.

AB  - Abstract Purpose Hemoperitoneum in the hypotensive trauma patient is an indication for emergent laparotomy. Focused assessment sonography in trauma (FAST) is a widely used tool for detecting hemoperitoneum. The usefulness of FAST is currently limited by low sensitivity. We hypothesize rolling patients onto their right side will pool small volumes of fluid into the right upper quadrant of the abdomen leading to increased sensitivity. Methods Peritoneal dialysis patients were recruited for voluntary participation in a small pilot prospective clinical trial. Each participant first underwent a supine FAST followed by a 30-second roll onto the right side. Once back in the supine position, the FAST was repeated (FASTeR or FAST examination after right-sided roll). About 50?mL aliquots of dialysate were sequentially infused into the abdomen and the imaging sequence repeated until a positive finding was obtained. Results Seven patients were consented for the study. One patient was found to have an equivocal examination secondary to renal cysts. All six remaining participants converted to a positive FASTeR at an intra-abdominal fluid volume at which standard FAST was negative. Conclusions Rolling patients to the right side increased FAST sensitivity, converting false-negative to true positives examinations. A larger study is needed to validate our preliminary data.

AB  - Abstract Background Evidence suggests that maternal interpersonal trauma can adversely affect offspring health, but little is known about potential transmission pathways. We investigated whether interpersonal trauma exposure had direct and indirect associations with offspring social-emotional development at 12-months of age in an at-risk, home visited population. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 1172 mother-child dyads who participated in a multi-site, early childhood home visiting program. Children were born January 2007 to June 2010 and data were collected at enrolment (prenatal/birth) through 12-months of age. Multivariable path analyses were used to examine the relationship between maternal interpersonal trauma, subsequent psychosocial mediators (maternal depressive symptoms, social support, and home environment), and the outcome of child social-emotional development measured with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social-Emotional (ASQ:SE). Maternal interpersonal trauma was characterized as any previous exposure, the level of exposure, and type (e.g. abuse) of exposure. Results The prevalence of maternal interpersonal trauma exposure was 69.1%, and exposures ranged from 1 type (19.3%) to 7 types (2.3%). Interpersonal trauma was associated with a 3.6 point (95% confidence interval 1.8, 5.4) higher ASQ:SE score among offspring and indicated greater developmental risk. An estimated 23.4% of the total effect was mediated by increased maternal depressive symptoms and lower social support. Differential effects were observed by the level and type of interpersonal trauma exposure. Conclusion Maternal interpersonal trauma exposures can negatively impact child social-emotional development, acting in part through maternal psychosocial factors. Future research is needed to further elucidate the mechanisms of intergenerational risk.

AB  - Background: Recent studies from the USA and South Africa suggest that primary repair or resection and primary anastomosis have become the recommended treatment for most traumatic colon injuries. The aim of the present review is to determine the applicability of these studies to the urban Australian setting. Methods: All patients with colon injuries operated on at the Royal Melbourne Hospital from March 1989 to March 1999 were identified. Data were collected by a retrospective chart review. Results:? A total of 20 patients sustained 26 injuries to the colon. Blunt injuries were more common than penetrating injuries (14?vs?6). Significant other injuries occurred in 15 patients. Colostomies were performed in four patients. The overall mortality rate was 10%. There were no anastomotic leaks. Primary repair or resection and primary anastomosis were not associated with any increase in intra-abdominal complications. Conclusion:? Evidence from large trauma centres supporting primary repair or resection and primary anastomosis is also applicable to regions that have a low rate of traumatic colon injury.

AB  - Research has demonstrated a strong positive association between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and physical pain. However, few studies have explored the impact of pain problems on the symptoms and treatment of PTSD, and results remain inconsistent. This longitudinal study examined whether trauma-related and trauma-unrelated pain differentially and uniquely predicted reexperiencing symptoms. We also examined whether levels of reexperiencing symptoms mediated the relationship between pain intensity and posttreatment symptoms of avoidance, numbing, and hyperarousal (ANH). Analyses were conducted using archival data from 99 treatment-seeking veterans who reported the etiology and intensity of their pain and severity of PTSD symptoms pre- and posttreatment. Among veterans with trauma-related pain, pain intensity (a) uniquely corresponded to greater posttreatment reexperiencing symptoms (b = 1.09), and (b) was indirectly predictive of ANH symptoms via the reexperiencing symptoms (b = 1.93). However, veterans with trauma-unrelated pain evidenced no associations between pain intensity and reexperiencing (b = 0.04) or ANH symptoms (b = 0.06). We thus found that trauma-related pain was indirectly related to poor PTSD treatment outcomes via reexperiencing symptoms. These findings offer additional insight into factors that may influence PTSD treatment outcomes for pain-suffering trauma survivors.

AB  - Abstract Objective Evidence-based management for patients with acute traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) in the ED has a critical impact on long-term outcomes. Acute hypotension post-injury may compromise spinal cord perfusion and extend neurological damage. Published guidelines recommend mean arterial blood pressure (BP) maintenance between 85 and 90?mmHg for 7 days post-injury; the extent to which this is followed in Australia is unknown. Methods Prospective observational study of patients ≥16?years with TSCI, treated at 48 hospitals across two Australian states. Mean arterial BPs were recorded in the Ambulance, and ED arrival and discharge. Patients? medical records documented treatment provided (intravenous fluids, vasopressors or both) for BP augmentation. Hypotension was defined as mean arterial BP <85?mmHg, per the American Association of Neurological Surgeons guidelines. Results The 208 patients with TSCI in the present study were more likely to receive BP augmentation if they experienced direct transport to a Spinal Cord Service hospital (OR 5.57, 95% CI 2.32?10.11), had a cervical level injury (OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.01?5.5) or were hypotensive on ED arrival (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.34?4.39). Of the 112 patients who were hypotensive, 71 (63.4%) received treatment for this; however, the majority (76%) remained hypotensive on discharge. Conclusion Hypotensive patients? post-TSCI experienced heterogeneous ED care discordant with published guidelines; varying by hospital type. Specialist care and more severe injury increased likelihood of guideline adherence. Lack of adherence may influence patient outcomes. Level 1 evidence is needed along with consistent guideline implementation and clinician training to likely improve TSCI management and outcomes.

This discussion paper reports development of a model to advance nursing science and practice in trauma care based on an analysis of the literature and expert opinion. Background.? The continuum of clinical care provided to trauma patients extends from the time of injury through to long-term recovery and final outcomes. Nurses bring a unique expertise to meet the complex physical and psychosocial needs of trauma patients and their families to influence outcomes across this entire continuum. Data sources.? Literature was obtained by searching CINAHL, PubMed and OvidMedline databases for 1990?2010. Search terms included trauma, nursing, scope of practice and role, with results restricted to those published in English. Manual searches of relevant journals and websites were undertaken. Discussion.? Core concepts in this trauma outcomes model include environment, person/family, structured care settings, long-term outcomes and nursing interventions. The relationships between each of these concepts extend across all phases of care. Intermediate outcomes are achieved in each phase of care and influence and have congruence with long-term outcomes. Implications for policy and practice.? This model is intended to provide a framework to assist trauma nurses and researchers to consider the injured person in the context of the social, economic, cultural and physical environment from which they come and the long-term goals that each person has during recovery. The entire model requires testing in research and assessment of its practical contribution to practice. Conclusion.? Planning and integrating care across the trauma continuum and recognition of the role of the injured person?s background, family and resources will lead to improved long-term outcomes.

AB  - Abstract The deleterious impact of concomitant muscle injury on fracture healing and limb function is commonly considered part of the natural sequela of orthopedic trauma. Recent reports suggest that heightened inflammation in the surrounding traumatized musculature is a primary determinant of fracture healing. Relatedly, there are emerging potential therapeutic approaches for severe muscle trauma (e.g., volumetric muscle loss [VML] injury), such as autologous minced muscle grafts (1 mm3 pieces of muscle; GRAFT), that can partially prevent chronic functional deficits and appear to have an immunomodulatory effect within VML injured muscle. The primary goal of this study was to determine if repair of VML injury with GRAFT rescues impaired fracture healing and improves the strength of the traumatized muscle in a male Lewis rat model of tibia open fracture. The most salient findings of the study were: (1) tibialis anterior (TA) muscle repair with GRAFT improved endogenous healing of fractured tibia and improved the functional outcome of muscle regeneration; (2) GRAFT repair attenuated the monocyte/macrophage (CD45+CDllb+) and T lymphocyte (CD3+) response to VML injury; (3) TA muscle protein concentrations of MCP1, IL-10, and IGF-1 were augmented in a proregenerative manner by GRAFT repair; (4) VML injury concomitant with osteotomy induced a heightened systemic presence of alarmins (e.g., soluble RAGE) and leukocytes (e.g., monocytes), and depressed IGF-1 concentration, which GRAFT repair ameliorated. Collectively, these data indicate that repair of VML injury with a regenerative therapy can modulate the inflammatory and regenerative phenotype of the treated muscle and in association improve musculoskeletal healing.

AB  - Abstract Blunt and penetrating trauma is common in small animal patients, accounting for a large number of emergency room visits. Rapid recognition and treatment of abnormalities in tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery is essential to ensure patient survival and decrease the risk for the development of the systemic inflammatory response and MODS. Knowledge of trauma patterns in dogs and cats can help the emergency veterinarian rapidly identify injuries associated with trauma and allow for directed care. Animal trauma scoring systems are useful to help identify more severely injured patients, evaluate hospital outcomes and for patient stratification for clinical trials.

AB  - Objective To review the guidelines released in the last decade by several organisations for the optimal evaluation and management of genitourinary injuries (renal, ureteric, bladder, urethral and genital). Methods This is a review of the genitourinary trauma guidelines from the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA), and renal trauma guidelines from the Société Internationale d'Urologie (SIU). Results Most recommendations are guided by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) organ injury severity system. Grade A evidence is rare in genitourinary trauma, and most recommendations are based on Grade B or C evidence. The findings of the most recent urological trauma guidelines are summarised. All guidelines recommend conservative management for low-grade injuries. The major difference is for haemodynamically stable patients who have high-grade renal trauma; the SIU guidelines recommend exploratory laparotomy, the EAU guidelines recommend renal exploration only if the injury is vascular, and the AUA guidelines recommend initial conservative management. Conclusion There is generally consensus among the three guidelines. Recommendations are based on observational or retrospective studies, as well as clinical principles and expert opinions. Multi-institutional collaborative research can improve the quality of evidence and direct more effective evaluation and management of urological trauma.

AB  - Aims and objectives To systematically review the relationship of trauma centre characteristics and trauma patient outcomes. Background Numerous studies have documented the impact of trauma centre level, trauma centre verification, volume per centre and per surgeon or resource availability on outcomes among trauma patients. However, there continues to be debated about whether trauma care is comparable by these trauma centre characteristics. Design Systematic review. Methods Eligible studies were identified via electronic database searches, footnote chasing and contact with clinical experts. Quality of selected studies was assessed in terms of internal and external validity using 14 questions. Two reviewers independently examined titles, abstracts and whether each met the predefined criteria. Results A total of 50 studies which met criteria were selected. Ten of 17 articles showed that level I trauma centres had better patient outcomes than level II centres. The achievement of trauma centre verification by American College of Surgeons or State was beneficial to decreasing mortality and length of stay in 9 of 11 studies. High trauma admission volume was beneficial in 8 of 16 studies. The volume per trauma surgeon did not contribute to better patient outcomes in 4 of 5 studies. The availability of in-house trauma surgeon was beneficial to lower mortality and shorter length of stay in only 2 of 9 studies. Conclusion This review supports that achieving the trauma centre verification by American College of Surgeons or State is definitely beneficial to patient outcomes. However, the benefit of level I centres compared with level II centres, and volume of annual trauma patients to outcomes is still debating. Further prospective study examining this relationship is required. Relevance to clinical practice Understanding which characteristics of trauma centre provides the best prospect for improved outcomes depending on patient need and resource availability would allow further appreciation of the processes that foster such enhancement.

AB  - Background and Objectives? The empiric use of a high plasma to packed red-blood-cell [fresh frozen plasma:red-blood-cells (FFP:RBC)] ratio in trauma resuscitation for patients with massive bleeding has become well accepted without clear or objective indications. Increased plasma transfusion is associated with worse outcome in some patient populations. While previous studies analyse only patients who received a massive transfusion, this study analyses those that are at risk to receive a massive transfusion, based on the trauma-associated severe haemorrhage (TASH) score, to objectively determine which patients after severe trauma would benefit or have increased complications by the use of a high FFP:RBC ratio. Methods? Multicentre retrospective study from the Trauma Registry of the German Trauma Society. Multivariate logistic regression and statistical risk adjustments utilized in analyses. Results? A high ratio of FFP:RBC in the ≥15 TASH group was independently associated with survival, with an odds ratio of 2·5 (1·6?4·0), while the <15 TASH group was associated with increased multi-organ failure, 47% vs. 38%, (P?<?0·005). Conclusions? A predictive model of massive transfusion upon admission might be able to rapidly identify which severe trauma patients would benefit or have increased complications from the immediate application of a high ratio of FFP:RBCs. This study helps to identify the appropriate population for a prospective, interventional trial.

The aim of this trial was to investigate the effectiveness of multi-layered soft silicone foam dressings in preventing intensive care unit (ICU) pressure ulcers when applied in the emergency department to 440 trauma and critically ill patients. Intervention group patients (n = 219) had Mepilex? Border Sacrum and Mepilex? Heel dressings applied in the emergency department and maintained throughout their ICU stay. Results revealed that there were significantly fewer patients with pressure ulcers in the intervention group compared to the control group (5 versus 20, P = 0·001). This represented a 10% difference in incidence between the groups (3·1% versus 13·1%) and a number needed to treat of ten patients to prevent one pressure ulcer. Overall there were fewer sacral (2 versus 8, P = 0·05) and heel pressure ulcers (5 versus 19, P = 0·002) and pressure injuries overall (7 versus 27, P = 0·002) in interventions than in controls. The time to injury survival analysis indicated that intervention group patients had a hazard ratio of 0·19 (P = 0·002) compared to control group patients. We conclude that multi-layered soft silicone foam dressings are effective in preventing pressure ulcers in critically ill patients when applied in the emergency department prior to ICU transfer.

AB  - Summary For well over a 100 years, a diagnostic stew of trauma-related 'diseases' and syndromes has been simmering. This chapter explores the changing meanings of this diagnosis from both historical and theoretical perspectives. Before the advent of the borderline category, the primary division in psychopathology was between neurosis and psychosis. Kernberg (1984) viewed splitting as a 'primitive form' of dissociation. But he used the term to describe dichotomous and alternating aggressive and libidinal ego-states. Trauma disrupts a person's sense of continuity, not only by breaking apart the prior organization of experience but also by impeding the linking of states of mind in the course of development. Ryle (1997) argues that splitting in borderline personality (BPD) is the manifestation of internalized reciprocal role relationships, such as victim/bully, needy child/nurturing caregiver. The splitting in BPD can almost reach the level of delusions.

AB  - Abstract Interest in trauma-informed approaches has grown substantially. These approaches are characterized by integrating understanding of trauma throughout a program, organization, or system to enhance the quality, effectiveness, and delivery of services provided to individuals and groups. However, variation in definitions of trauma-informed approaches, coupled with underdeveloped research on measurement, poses challenges for evaluating the effectiveness of models designed to support a trauma-informed approach. This systematic review of peer-reviewed and gray literature identified 49 systems-based measures that were created to assess the extent to which relational, organizational, and community/system practices were trauma-informed. Measures were included if they assessed at least one component of a trauma-informed approach, were not screening or diagnostic instruments, were standardized, were relevant to practices addressing the psychological impacts of trauma, were printed in English, and were published between 1988 and 2018. Most (77.6%) measures assessed organizational-level staff and climate characteristics. There remain several challenges to this emerging field, including inconsistently reported psychometric data, redundancy across measures, insufficient evidence of a link to stakeholder outcomes, and limited information about measurement development processes. We discuss these opportunities and challenges and their implications for future research and practice.

AB  - Abstract Objective: Laryngeal trauma is an infrequent diagnosis with a scarcity of published data. We aim to further define the factors associated with positive surgical outcomes of adult laryngeal trauma. Study Design: Multi-institution database analysis. Methods: Of the 1.9 million trauma cases from the National Trauma Database (NTDB), 564 adult trauma events were selected with ICD-9 codes specific to laryngeal trauma. Results: Laryngeal trauma was seen predominately in white (61.5%), middle-aged (40.6 years), male (83.7%) patients experiencing blunt (70.7%) laryngeal injury with multiorgan system (92.2%) trauma. There was an overall 17.9% mortality rate. Within the 564 cases, 133 direct laryngoscopies, 185 tracheostomies, 53 laryngeal suturing, and 60 laryngeal fracture repairs were performed. In univariate negative binomial regression models, trauma severity (P ≤ .01), placement of tracheostomy (P lt; .01), and delayed tracheostomy placement (P = .04, .03, .048) were associated with increased ventilator dependence, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and overall hospital admission duration. Multivariate regression models demonstrated significant associations between tracheostomy performed within 24 hours and shortened ICU stay (P = .03, ? = ?.28, SE = 1.7) and overall hospital stay (P = .009, ? = ?.23, SE = 3.1). Conclusions: The NTDB allows study of the largest laryngeal trauma cohort in modern literature. Although complexities arise in the treatment of laryngeal traumas, when indicated, surgical airway should be placed within 24 hours of presentation to improve the overall hospital course.

AB  - Highlights Schools should play an important role in promoting resilience in children who experience trauma. Schools remain poorly equipped to address the needs of children with trauma histories. More research on classroom-based and school-wide trauma-informed interventions is required. Evaluation of school-based programs requires designs suited to complex environments. Questions remain as to how to position programs to improve access to services and sustainability.
