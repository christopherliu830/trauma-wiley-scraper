AB  - choi y., lawler e., boenecke c.a., ponatoski e.r. & zimring c.m. (2011)?Developing a multi-systemic fall prevention model, incorporating the physical environment, the care process, and technology: a systematic review. Journal of Advanced Nursing67(12), 2501?2524. Abstract Aims.? This paper reports a review that assessed the effectiveness and characteristics of fall prevention interventions implemented in hospitals. A multi-systemic fall prevention model that establishes a practical framework was developed from the evidence. Background.? Falls occur through complex interactions between patient-related and environmental risk factors, suggesting a need for multifaceted fall prevention approaches that address both factors. Data sources.? We searched Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo and the Web of Science databases for references published between January 1990 and June 2009 and scrutinized secondary references from acquired papers. Review methods.? Due to the heterogeneity of interventions and populations, we conducted a quantitative systematic review without a meta-analysis and used a narrative summary to report findings. Results.? From the review, three distinct characteristics of fall prevention interventions emerged: (1) the physical environment, (2) the care process and culture and (3) technology. While clinically significant evidence shows the efficacy of environment-related interventions in reducing falls and fall-related injuries, the literature identified few hospitals that had introduced environment-related interventions in their multifaceted fall intervention strategies. Conclusion.? Using the multi-systemic fall prevention model, hospitals should promote a practical strategy that benefits from the collective effects of the physical environment, the care process and culture and technology to prevent falls and fall-related injuries. By doing so, they can more effectively address the various risk factors for falling and therefore, prevent falls. Studies that test the proposed model need to be conducted to establish the efficacy of the model in practice.

AB  - In recent years, local activists in the Global North and South have been organizing to improve degraded and abandoned spaces in marginalized neighborhoods by creating parks, playgrounds, urban farms, or community gardens. This paper integrates existing knowledge on urban place attachment and sense of community with scholarship on environmental justice in order to understand the role of place attachment in environmental mobilization in distressed neighborhoods across political systems and urbanization contexts. It examines the different forms of connections that activists develop and express toward neighborhoods with long-time substandard environmental conditions and how their experience of the neighborhood shapes their engagement in environmental revitalization projects. This comparison of three neighborhoods in Barcelona, Boston, and Havana shows that activists in all three places intend for their environmental endeavors to express grief at the loss of community, fears of erasure, and emotional connection and feelings of responsibility to place. To address environmental trauma, they aim to construct nurturing, soothing, ?safe havens,? recreate rootedness, and remake place for residents.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: Acute gastrointestinal bleeding (AGIB) is a serious and life-threatening condition. Many diagnostic procedures and tests are being used to detect the site of bleeding with different success rates. The aim of our study is to prospectively evaluate accuracy of 64-slice multi-detector computerised tomography (MDCT) in the diagnosis of lower AGIB. Methods: Between September 2007 and January 2009, patients with presumed lower AGIB were referred to the radiology department of our institution for 64-slice MDCT examination as part of the investigation for the lower AGIB. Any abnormalities to account for bleeding, such as tumours, bowel wall enhancement and increased intraluminal density, were recorded. Results: Out of 139 patients with AGIB that were admitted to our casualty department, 27 patients (19 men and 8 women) in the age range of 24?88?years (mean age, 56?years) were suspected to have lower AGIB. Sixty-four-slice MDCT was performed and considered positive for bleeding in 19 (70%) cases, and in all the cases, the bleeding source was indentified in the arterial phase, showing a focal dense wall enhancement in 8 (42%) cases, circumferential wall enhancement in 4 (22%) cases and progressive increasing intraluminal density in 7 (36%) cases. The venous phase scan showed increased dispersion of the contrast within the lumen as an additional clue for active extravasation in 15 (79%) out of the 19 cases. Delayed 5-min scanning showed the same findings as venous phase in all the 19 positive cases and failed to depict any additional findings in the eight cases that were negative on arterial or venous phases. Conclusion: The study supports the high accuracy of 64-slice MDCT in locating the site of AGIB in patients thought to have a distal source of bleeding. Its accuracy in clinically proximal bleeding is not clear from this study, but MDCT is capable of showing such sources.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The pathogenetic mechanisms causing a dementing brain disease after temporary ischemia, heat shock, or brain trauma are surveyed. These lesions increase beta amyloid precursor protein (beta APP) synthesis. This process is potentiated by an ischemic glutamate release that opens cellular Ca2+ channels, inhibiting glucose turnover and ATP production, which is, under these conditions, accompanied by the generation of beta amyloid (beta A), even in young persons. Beta amyloid starts a vicious circle by inactivating the glycolytic key enzyme, phos-phofructokinase, which, with age, exhausts the functional reserve capacity of the brain. This demonstrates that beta A is an epiphenomenon of a dementing brain disease, triggered by the disturbance of glucose turnover and oxidative phosphorylation. Clinical studies have shown that a dementing brain disease can be clearly objectified and monitored by 18F-2-deoxyglucose PET studies. This paper looks briefly a pharmacologic approaches to this disease using models of temporary ischemia, the testing of 14C-deoxyglucose turnover, or examination with 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques. In conclusion, the key process of all dementing brain diseases of the Alzheimer type is a decreased glucose turnover and subsequently decreased oxidative phosphorylation, linked directly to a secondary amyloid formation and nerve cell atrophy.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aim Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by symptoms of hyperarousal and hypervigilance. Increasing research on the ?gut?brain? axis (bidirectional signaling between the gut and the brain) has drawn links between PTSD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), an exceedingly common yet incompletely understood gastrointestinal condition. This meta-analysis thus aimed to examine the body of evidence and extent of association of PTSD with IBS. Methods Using the keywords [early abuse OR childhood abuse OR violence OR trauma OR PTSD] AND [irritable bowel syndrome or IBS], a preliminary search on the PubMed, Medline, Embase, ScienceDirect, PsychINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases yielded 11,257 papers published in English between January 1, 1988, and May 1, 2018. Of these, only eight studies were included in the final meta-analysis. Results The eight studies (four cross-sectional and four cohort) contained a total of 648,375 subjects. Most studies were from the USA and conducted on army veterans. The funnel plot revealed a roughly symmetrical distribution of studies, and Egger test was not significant for publication bias (P = 0.583). Random-effects meta-analysis found PTSD to be a significant risk factor for IBS (pooled odds ratio 2.80, 95% confidence interval: 2.06 to 3.54, P < 0.001). Conclusions Overall, PTSD is associated with an increased likelihood of IBS. This is the first meta-analysis to specifically examine the association between PTSD and IBS, and it provides insights into the probable (patho)physiology and management of IBS, supporting a holistic consideration of the psychosocial aspects of IBS and further research into effective multi-modal therapeutics.

AB  - Summary Multi-lumen extensions used to infuse multiple fluids via a single intravenous cannula might increase resistance and so limit the flow that can be achieved. We constructed low-pressure and high-pressure models and compared the effect of two different multi-lumen extensions on flow rate. Both multi-lumen extensions reduced flows by up to 76% (p < 0.001). The effect was greatest with large cannulae and in the high-pressure model, with the longer and narrower extension most impeding flow. Multi-lumen extensions can therefore significantly impede fluid flow, and should be avoided or removed when rapid infusion is required. These effects are less important in paediatric anaesthesia where smaller cannulae are used. Manufacturers should include internal diameter or flow effects on the packaging of these extensions to assist clinicians in making such decisions.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews a myriad of issues that often overshadow polygraph testing generally and post-conviction polygraph testing specifically. First the history of the post-conviction polygraph examination is reviewed and this is followed by discussions of the value and controversies that surround its use. The use of the polygraph in the United States is common. Polygraph testing is typically used in the military, employment screening and law enforcement interrogation. Research has established that, in combination with treatment, polygraph testing provides significant information about sex offenders that can be used to effectively treat and supervise them. Criminal justice supervision is also important, as it provides the incentive for compliance with treatment and polygraph testing. The Containment Model is a relatively new approach to dealing with sex offenders, and there are few studies evaluating its effectiveness.

Are multi family groups appropriate for patients with first episode psychosis? A 5-year naturalistic follow-up study. Objective:? To compare outcome over 5?years for patients who participated in multi family groups (MFGs) to those who refused or were not offered participation. Method:? Of 301 first episode psychotic patients aged 15?65?years, 147 participated in MFGs. Outcome was measured by drop-out rates, positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) symptom scores, and duration of psychotic episodes during the follow-up period. Results:? Multi family group participants had a significantly lower drop-out rates at 5-year follow-up than patients who did not participate. However, the MFG participants had significantly less improvement in PANSS positive and excitative symptoms and had significantly longer duration of psychotic symptoms during the follow-up period. Conclusion:? Multi family groups appear to increase the chance of retaining patients in a follow-up study, but adjustment of the programme may be necessary with first episode psychosis patients to meet their needs better.

AB  - Abstract A low-cost 3D printed model has been introduced into the oral and maxillofacial surgery teaching program of undergraduate students to improve education and mechanical comprehension of craniofacial trauma. Steps of the 3D printed haptic model building process are listed. 3D printed models of facial fractures were obtained from Data Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) data. Computed Aided Design and Manufacturing (CAD-CAM) freeware was used to create new fractures on the standard tessellation language (STL) file. 3D printed haptic model appears to be an efficient low-cost support for craniofacial trauma education of undergraduate students.

The 14-year survival rate for AD was 2.4% versus an expected rate of 16.6%, and for MID 1.7% versus 13.3% expected. MID showed a more malignant natural course than AD. Men carried a less favourable survival prognosis than women, both in AD and MID: the relative risk of dying for women was half that for men in both diseases. In MID, advanced disability indicated a relative risk of dying over twice as high. In both diseases the risk of death was substantially higher in the event of occurrence of primitive reflexes.

AB  - Abstract Genetic testing is increasingly available in medical settings and direct-to-consumer. However, the large and growing literature on genetic testing decisions is rife with conflicting findings, inconsistent methodology, and uneven attention across test types and across predictors of genetic testing decisions. Existing reviews of the literature draw broad conclusions but sacrifice nuanced analysis that with a closer look reveals far more inconsistency than homogeny across studies. The goals of this paper are to provide a systematic review of the empirical work on predictors of genetic testing decisions, highlight areas of consistency and inconsistency, and suggest productive directions for future research. We included all studies that provided quantitative analysis of subjective (e.g., perceived risk, perceived benefits of testing) and/or objective (e.g., family history, sociodemographic variables) predictors of genetic testing interest, intentions, or uptake, which produced a sample of 115 studies. From this review, we conclude that self-reported and test-related (as opposed to disorder-related or objective) predictors are relatively consistent across studies but that theoretically-driven efforts to examine testing interest across test types are sorely needed.

AB  - Abstract This paper examines the relationship between emotions, depression and eating disorders. Initially, a review is undertaken of the current state of the research and clinical literature with regard to emotional factors in eating disorders. This literature is then integrated within a version of the multi-level model of emotion proposed by Power and Dalgleish. The aim of this paper is to incorporate a basic emotions, multi-modal perspective into developing a new emotions-based model that offers a theoretical understanding of psychological mechanisms in eating disorders. Within the new Schematic Propositional Analogical Associative Representation System model applied to eating disorders, it is argued that the emotions of anger and disgust are of importance in eating disorders and that the eating disorder itself operates as an inhibitor of emotions within the self. It is hoped that the development of a multi-levelled model of eating disorders will allow for the construction of number of specific testable hypotheses that are relevant to future research into the psychological treatment and understanding of eating disorders.?Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

While progress has been made in recent years in relation to the understanding and development of aetiological theories, classification, assessment and management strategies and protocols in the adult population, similar advances have lagged behind for the elderly. Aims To review the adult literature regarding PTSD and discuss how this might apply to an elderly population. An attempt is made to highlight a better awareness of the field of psychological trauma in the elderly in the hope of stimulating debate and research. Method A review of the adult literature is conducted relating to classification, aetiology, demographic features, vulnerability, assessment, clinical management including psychotherapy and medications and how these may apply to the elderly. Results Little has been published in this field that directly relates to the elderly. The adult literature allows insight into understanding how PTSD may present in the elderly, and how they may be managed. Conclusions Further specific research is needed in the elderly in order to facilitate a better understanding of PTSD that present in this unique population. This will lead to better clinical assessment, management and treatment provision. Copyright ? 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Early life trauma is a risk factor for life-long disorders related to emotional processing, but knowledge underlying its enduring effect is incomplete. This study was motivated by the hypothesis that early life trauma increases amygdala-dependent threat responses via reduction in inhibition by parvalbumin (PV) interneurons and perineuronal nets (PNN) supporting PV cells, thus increasing excitability of the basolateral amygdala (BLA). From postnatal day (PN) 8?12, rat pups of both sexes were reared under normal bedding or under insufficient nest-building materials to induce maternal-to-infant maltreatment trauma (Scarcity-Adversity Model, SAM). At weaning age of PN23, the SAM group exhibited increased threat responses to predator odor. The SAM-induced increase in threat response was recapitulated in normally reared PN22?23 rats that were unilaterally depleted of PNN in the BLA by the enzymes, chondroitinase-ABC plus hyaluronidase at PN19?20. Light and electron microscopic analysis of the BLA revealed that anterior-to-mid levels of SAM group's BLAs exhibited decreased PNN intensity and decreased axo-somatic synapses between PV-to-principal pyramidal-like neurons and PV-to-PV. PV and PNN densities (cells/mm2) in the BLA of both control (CON) and SAM groups were still low at PN12 and SAM delayed the ontogenetic rise of PV intensity and PNN density. Moreover, PV cell density in the anterior-to-mid BLA correlated negatively with threat response of CON animals, but not for SAM animals. Thus, reduction of PNN-supported, PV-mediated somatic inhibition of pyramidal cells provides a mechanistic support for the enduring effect of early life maltreatment manifested as increasing innate threat response at weaning.

AB  - Abstract Preclinical Research Point of Care testing in the perioperative arena is a high priority topic, specifically in cardiac surgery where a majority of perioperative blood transfusions occur. Platelet function in particular is of interest in cardiac surgery as cardiopulmonary bypass itself creates known platelet dysfunction, but also because more and more patients are on antiplatelet agents due to coronary stenting procedures. This review will focus on presenting current data relating to platelet function in the perioperative setting, along with a brief review of general coagulation concepts.

AB  - Abstract Despite clinical observations that many veterans have multiple sources of war-related guilt, many problematic guilt issues are commonly not treated or even detected by clinicians. We describe development of a survey that systematically assesses idiosyncratic sources of guilt across the spectrum of events that are potential sources of trauma-related guilt from the war-zone. A multimethod strategy was used to develop a survey with strong content validity. Results indicate the survey is temporally stable, substantially correlated with other measures of guilt, and highly correlated with measures of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Findings confirm that many Vietnam veterans have multiple sources of severe war-related guilt. The survey may have important clinical utility for problem identification, treatment planning, and evaluating treatment efficacy.

AB  - ABSTRACT Kernel machine learning methods, such as the SNP-set kernel association test (SKAT), have been widely used to test associations between traits and genetic polymorphisms. In contrast to traditional single-SNP analysis methods, these methods are designed to examine the joint effect of a set of related SNPs (such as a group of SNPs within a gene or a pathway) and are able to identify sets of SNPs that are associated with the trait of interest. However, as with many multi-SNP testing approaches, kernel machine testing can draw conclusion only at the SNP-set level, and does not directly inform on which one(s) of the identified SNP set is actually driving the associations. A recently proposed procedure, KerNel Iterative Feature Extraction (KNIFE), provides a general framework for incorporating variable selection into kernel machine methods. In this article, we focus on quantitative traits and relatively common SNPs, and adapt the KNIFE procedure to genetic association studies and propose an approach to identify driver SNPs after the application of SKAT to gene set analysis. Our approach accommodates several kernels that are widely used in SNP analysis, such as the linear kernel and the Identity by State (IBS) kernel. The proposed approach provides practically useful utilities to prioritize SNPs, and fills the gap between SNP set analysis and biological functional studies. Both simulation studies and real data application are used to demonstrate the proposed approach.

AB  - Summary Major trauma increases vulnerability to systemic infections due to poorly defined immunosuppressive mechanisms. It confers no evolutionary advantage. Our objective was to develop better biomarkers of post-traumatic immunosuppression (PTI) and to extend our observation that PTI was reversed by anti-coagulated salvaged blood transfusion, in the knowledge that others have shown that non-anti-coagulated (fibrinolysed) salvaged blood was immunosuppressive. A prospective non-randomized cohort study of patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty included 25 who received salvaged blood transfusions collected post-operatively into acid?citrate?dextrose anti-coagulant (ASBT cohort), and 18 non-transfused patients (NSBT cohort). Biomarkers of sterile trauma included haematological values, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines and chemokines. Salvaged blood was analysed within 1?and 6?h after commencing collection. Biomarkers were expressed as fold-changes over preoperative values. Certain biomarkers of sterile trauma were common to all 43 patients, including supranormal levels of: interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-8, heat shock protein-70 and calgranulin-S100-A8/9. Other proinflammatory biomarkers which were subnormal in NSBT became supranormal in ASBT patients, including IL-1?, IL-2, IL-17A, interferon (IFN)-?, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and annexin-A2. Furthermore, ASBT exhibited subnormal levels of anti-inflammatory biomarkers: IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13. Salvaged blood analyses revealed sustained high levels of IL-9, IL-10 and certain DAMPs, including calgranulin-S100-A8/9, alpha-defensin and heat shock proteins 27, 60 and 70. Active synthesis during salvaged blood collection yielded increasingly elevated levels of annexin-A2, IL-1?, Il-1-receptor-antagonist, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, IFN-?, TNF-α, transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α. Elevated levels of high-mobility group-box protein-1 decreased. In conclusion, we demonstrated that anti-coagulated salvaged blood reversed PTI, and was attributed to immune stimulants generated during salvaged blood collection.
