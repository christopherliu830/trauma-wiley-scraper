AB  - Asymptomatic tumors are not uncommon, may be diagnosed during clinical examination or during surgical interventions for other purposes such as treatment of a hemorrhage due a blunt trauma. Case report? 6 year-old boy had fallen, hitting his abdomen against a rock, and arrived at hospital ten hours later. Initial assessment he was complaining of diffuse abdominal pain; his physical examination showed: respiratory rate: 16?mov/min, blood pressure: 100???80?mmHg, heart rate: 100?bat/min, and Glasgow coma score: 15. His abdomen was distended, with guarding and rebound tenderness, and had a palpable mass. FAST ultrasound was positive; and Ct-scan showed an abdominal mass with 15???12???7?cm dimension, and moderate amount of free blood in the abdominal cavity. Laboratory tests showed: hemoglobin 9.9?mg/dl, hematocritic 28.8%, white blood cells 6.900?cel/dl. Midline laparotomy was performed, a large, injured and bleeding mesenteric mass was found encircling superior mesentery artery and several small bowel loops; 500?ml of free blood was found in the peritoneal cavity. Mesenteric mass was partially removed with a segment of the small bowel. Findings of anatomico-pathologic examination revealed an intestinal Burkitt lymphoma, with mesenteric linfonodes. Patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and started with quimotherapy. Comments? This case report shows an unusual traumatic abdominal blending that could not be clearly diagnosed before laparotomy was performed. The emergency of this case was bleeding control, decision to remove mass was taken only for this purpose, and not to treat the tumor. As removal of the whole mass was impossible, a partial removal was performed.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of manual toothbrushes of the same type with different bristle stiffness concerning plaque removal, gingivitis development, and soft tissue trauma. Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, three groups with 40 subjects each used manual toothbrushes with either hard-, medium-, or soft-bristle stiffness. The at-home brushing time was set for 2 minutes, twice a day. Four and 8 weeks after the baseline examination, clinical parameters for plaque removal, gingivitis, and soft tissue damage were recorded again. Recruitment and examinations of the subjects were performed at the Department of Operative and Preventive Dentistry and Endodontics, Heinrich Heine University. A total of 120 volunteers (age range: 18 to 62 years) were recruited and stratified according to sex and age. Primary outcome measures were differences in the Quigley and Hein index (QHI) and papillary bleeding index (PBI) compared to baseline; secondary outcome measures were differences in the modified approximal plaque index (MAPI) and Danser gingival abrasion index. Results: The QHI and MAPI showed lower index scores in subjects who used hard-bristled toothbrushes after 8 weeks (P <0.05 and P <0.001, respectively). In contrast, subjects who used toothbrushes with hard bristles demonstrated more gingival lesions (P <0.01) and higher PBI scores after 4 and 8 weeks (P <0.001) compared to subjects who used soft- or medium-bristled toothbrushes. Conclusion: Manual toothbrushes with hard bristles may better remove plaque, but may also cause more soft tissue trauma compared to brushes with softer bristles.

AB  - Background To assess intra- and inter-tester reliability of measuring shoulder strength using a new hand-held dynamometer. Methods On two occasions, two examiners (blinded to output) measured seven separate tests of shoulder strength. Twenty-three participants with no shoulder symptoms were tested bilaterally. Each test was performed three times as a ?make test' using a hand-held digital dynamometer. Results Intraclass correlation coefficients (2,1) and (2,3), 95% confidence intervals and standard errors of measurements (SEM) demonstrated good intra- and inter-tester reliability of all tests [ICC(2,3) >0.87], with the exception of inter-tester reliability of right abduction [ICC(2,3) = 0.77]. Greater reliability of all tests was demonstrated when the mean of three trials was used compared to the first measurement. Intra-tester reliability of all tests using ICC(2,1) ranged from 0.74 to 0.98; ICC(2,3) ranged from 0.89 to 0.98. Inter-tester reliability using ICC(2,1) ranged from 0.52 to 0.94; ICC(2,3) ranged from 0.77 to 0.96. The smallest detectable difference (SDD), used to measure precision, ranged from 5.9 to 12.5 Newtons. Discussion The findings obtained in the present study suggest that using the methods employed in the population investigated demonstrated good to excellent intra- and inter-tester reliability for the measurement of shoulder strength. The SEM and SDD findings provide guidance for values that may be considered as a real change in strength.

AB  - Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) seeks to identify preimplantation embryos with a normal chromosome complement (euploid) during in vitro fertilisation (IVF). By sifting out embryos with abnormal chromosome numbers (aneuploid), PGT-A should theoretically improve pregnancy success. However, earlier versions of PGT-A were ineffective, and in some cases, detrimental, due to biopsy-induced trauma and because the technology at the time could analyse only a fraction of all chromosomes. More recently, the emergence of technologies enabling all chromosomes to be analysed and a switch to less traumatic blastocyst-stage biopsy have seen widespread uptake of PGT-A. Assessing the full impact of blastocyst biopsy PGT-A requires consideration of multiple factors, including embryonic mosaicism, sensitivity of the technological platform used, embryo loss during long-term in vitro culture, embryo cryopreservation and inter-clinic variability in expertise. Significantly, there hasnt yet been an appropriately designed randomised controlled trial (RCT) of blastocyst biopsy PGT-A analysed by intention-to-treat that accounts for all these parameters on a per-cycle basis. The three RCTs reporting benefits studied outcomes on a per-embryo transfer basis were small and underpowered and demonstrated benefits for a very select sub-group of good prognosis patients. The liberal use of this very expensive IVF add-on for other patient populations has not yet been shown to be effective, or indeed, without harm.

AB  - Diagnostic testing of positive blood cultures is among the most critical tasks performed by clinical microbiology laboratories, and the total analysis time from sampling to results should be kept as short as possible. By providing identification of pelleted bacteria directly from positive blood-cultures, MALDI-TOF MS opens for relatively low-complex species-adjusted genetic susceptibility testing from the same bacterial pellet. In our lab routine, we prospectively evaluated a rapid in-house real-time PCR targeting the most common aminoglycoside and cephalosporin resistance genes in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and measured time to preliminary susceptibility reporting for 138 samples. The results were compared to direct phenotypic susceptibility testing with interpretation after 6 h and overnight incubation respectively. Results from the genetic susceptibility testing were available for 69.5% (96/138) of the positive blood cultures within 24 h after sample collection. No phenotypic susceptibility results were available at this time. Compared to overnight direct susceptibility testing, the average time from sample collection to preliminary susceptibility reporting was reduced with 43%, from 45 h and 5 min to 25 h and 44 min, providing an earlier adjustment of antimicrobial therapy for 12 patients. Minor logistic adjustments have the potential to save yet another 4 h.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aims? Addiction is a frequent comorbid disorder in schizophrenia and associated with poor outcome. The present study sought to determine whether addicted and non-addicted schizophrenic patients are impaired differentially on the executive abilities of working memory and multi-tasking which are relevant for maintaining abstinence. Design? Comparisons of executive performance in clinical and control groups. Setting? In-patient setting. Participants? The cognitive profile of schizophrenic patients with and without comorbid substance abuse disorder was compared with that of patients suffering from major depression or alcoholism and healthy participants. Measurements? A range of cognitive tasks was used to assess: (i) the ability to update continuously context information in working memory and to use it for action selection; and (ii) the capacity to divide attention between different sensory input channels and to coordinate verbal and manual responses. Findings? Single-diagnosis schizophrenic patients showed pronounced impairments on measures of online maintenance and use of context information. Their ability to coordinate different sensory input channels (divided attention) was also impaired. Addicted schizophrenics showed evidence of impaired sensory input management and of reduced context sensitivity, when age differences were controlled. Conclusions? The present study indicates severe working memory and multi-tasking deficits in schizophrenia which are, however, not exacerbated by comorbid addiction.

AB  - Objectives The aim of this study was to test the association of current contextual income inequality, contextual income inequality experienced during childhood, and individual factors with oral-health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) in adolescents. Methods Individual data of 3,854 adolescents aged 15?19 years from the Brazilian Oral Health Survey (SB Brasil Project) nested within 27 cities and contextual income inequality were analysed. OHRQoL was assessed using the Oral Impacts on Daily Performance (OIDP) questionnaire. The individual variables were demographic characteristics, socio-economic factors, and oral clinical measures. The Gini Index was used to evaluate city-level income inequality in 2003 (during childhood) and in 2010 (current) according to the tertiles of distribution. Multi-level Poisson regression was used to test the association of contextual income inequality and individual characteristics with OIDP extent according to the WHO framework on social determinants of health. Results The prevalence of OIDP was 34.5%. In the adjusted analysis, adolescents living in the cities with high-level income inequality during childhood were 1.75 times more likely (95% confidence interval 1.23?2.48) to have a higher mean of OIDP extent. Current income inequality was not associated with OIDP extent in adolescents. Conclusions Contextual income inequality during childhood was a structural determinant of OHRQoL among Brazilian adolescents after adjustment for individual demographic characteristics, socio-economic factors and oral clinical measures. Reducing social inequalities through inter-sectoral actions should be on the political agenda to improve adolescents' oral health.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Clodronic acid (CA) is a bisphosphonate which inhibits bone resorption through inhibition of formation/dissolution of hydroxyapatite crystals and by direct cellular effects on osteoclasts. The study was conducted to assess the short- and long-term effectiveness of CA for the control of lameness associated with navicular syndrome. Objectives To demonstrate the effectiveness of CA in navicular syndrome. Study design Randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, placebo controlled field trial in client-owned horses. Methods Horses with unilateral or bilateral forelimb lameness (AAEP lameness scale grade ≥2); positive anaesthesia of the distal palmar digital nerve(s); radiographic evidence of navicular syndrome and the absence of other causes of lameness were eligible for enrolment. Horses were randomised to treatment groups in a 3:1 ratio of CA to saline control. Treatment was administered once via intramuscular injection at 1.2?mg/kg bwt (maximum 765?mg CA or 15?ml saline). Efficacy was assessed by comparing lameness grades before and after treatment. Results 146 horses of various breeds were enrolled at 6 sites in Germany and US. At 8 weeks, horses in the CA group had a significantly higher success rate than horses in the control group (least squares mean 74.72% vs. 3.30%; P?=?0.0028). Efficacy was sustained through 180 days in 66% of horses. Adverse events were few and considered to be mild and transient. Conclusions Clodronic acid was safe and effective in navicular syndrome. Ethical animal research:?Owners gave informed consent for their horses? inclusion in the study. Sources of funding:?Dechra Ltd. Competing interests:?The late Dr Frevel was a consultant to Omnimedic GbR, which has applied for a patent for the use of clodronic acid for navicular syndrome. Dr Poole is employed by Dechra.

AB  - Background There are no randomized studies that compare outcomes after single-incision (SLC) and conventional multi-incision (MLC) laparoscopic cholecystectomy under an optimized perioperative analgesic regimen. Methods This patient- and assessor-blinded randomized three-centre clinical trial compared SLC and MLC in women admitted electively with cholecystolithiasis. Outcomes were registered on the day of operation (day 0), on postoperative days 1, 2, 3 and 30, and 12?months after surgery. Blinding of the patients was maintained until day 3. The primary endpoint was pain on movement measured on a visual analogue scale, reported repeatedly by the patient until day 3. Results The intention-to-treat population comprised 59 patients in the SLC and 58 in the MLC group. There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to any of the pain-related outcomes, on-demand administration of opioids or general discomfort. Median duration of surgery was 32·5?min longer in the SLC group (P?<?0·001). SLC was associated with a reduced incidence of vomiting on day 0 (7 versus 22 per cent; P?=?0·019). The incidences of wound-related problems were comparable. One patient in the SLC group experienced a biliary leak requiring endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The rates of incisional hernia at 12-month follow-up were 2 per cent in both groups. Cosmetic rating was significantly improved after SLC at 1 and 12?months (P?<?0·001). Conclusion SLC did not significantly diminish early pain in a setting with optimized perioperative analgesic patient care. SLC may reduce postoperative vomiting.

AB  - Abstract Background Flexion?extension radiography (FER) has been utilised for the detection of ligamentous injury in patients who have been cleared of bony injury. Some studies call into question the diagnostic accuracy of FER, the high proportion of inadequate FER images and the adverse effects of prolonged cervical collar immobilisation although awaiting FER. Methods We conducted a two-part retrospective study of trauma patients presenting to a trauma centre between January 2007 and December 2014. A cross-sectional analytic study was used to determine diagnostic accuracy and a case?control design was used to compare characteristics and complications of those having FER with similar patients not having FER. Inclusion criteria were age ≥16, blunt trauma mechanism, a normal computed tomography (CT) of the cervical spine and FER to assess for ligamentous injury. The reference standard was magnetic resonance imaging evidence of ligamentous disruption or a therapeutic intervention to treat ligamentous instability. Results There were 176 participants meeting inclusion criteria. Studies were considered inadequate in 168 participants (95.5%). There were zero true positives, four false positives, 168 true negatives and four false negatives: sensitivity 0% (0.0?60.2%), specificity 97.7 (94.2?99.4%), positive predictive value 0% (0.0?60.2%) and negative predictive value 97.7 (94.2?99.4%). Participants having FER remained in cervical collars and in hospital longer than control patients. Complications of cervical collar use were uncommon. Conclusion FER does not contribute additional diagnostic accuracy for the detection of ligamentous injury to the cervical spine following a normal CT of the cervical spine. We recommend FER be removed from cervical spine clearance protocols.

AB  - Abstract T1? describes the spin-lattice relaxation in the rotating frame and has been proposed for detecting damage to the cartilage collagen-proteoglycan matrix in osteoarthritis. In this study, a multi-slice T1? imaging method for knee cartilage was developed using spin-lock techniques and a spiral imaging sequence. The adverse effect of T1 regrowth during the multi-slice acquisition was eliminated by RF cycling. Agarose phantoms with different concentrations, 10 healthy volunteers, and 9 osteoarthritis patients were scanned at 3T. T1? values decreased as agarose concentration increased. T1? values obtained with imaging methods were compared with those obtained with spectroscopic methods. T1? values obtained during multi-slice acquisition were validated with those obtained in a single slice acquisition. Reproducibility was assessed using the average coefficient of variation of median T1?, which was 0.68% in phantoms and 4.8% in healthy volunteers. There was a significant difference (P = 0.002) in the average T1? within patellar and femoral cartilage between controls (45.04 ± 2.59 ms) and osteoarthritis patients (53.06 ± 4.60 ms). A significant correlation was found between T1? and T2; however, the difference of T2 was not significant between controls and osteoarthritis patients. The results suggest that T1? relaxation times may be a promising clinical tool for osteoarthritis detection and treatment monitoring. Magn Reson Med, 2005. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background Previous studies have shown that children with isolated linear skull fractures have excellent clinical outcomes and low risk of surgery. We wish to identify other injury patterns within the spectrum of paediatric mild head injury, which need only conservative management. Children with low risk of evolving neurosurgical lesions could be safely managed in primary hospitals. Methods We retrospectively analysed all children with mild head injury (i.e. admission Glasgow coma score 13?15) and skull fracture or haematoma on a head computed tomography scan admitted to Westmead Children's Hospital, Sydney over the years 2009?2014. Data were collected regarding demographics, clinical findings, mechanism of injury, head computed tomography scan findings, neurosurgical intervention, outcome and length of admission. Wilcoxon paired test was used with P value <0.05 considered significant. Results Four hundred and ten children were analysed. Three hundred and eighty-one (93%) children were managed conservatively, 18 (4%) underwent evacuation of extradural haematoma (TBI surgery) and 11 (3%) needed fracture repair surgery. Two children evolved a surgical lesion 24 h post-admission. Only 17 of 214 children transferred from peripheral hospitals needed neurosurgery. Overall outcomes: zero deaths, one needed brain injury rehabilitation and 63 needed child protection unit intervention. Seventy-five percentage of children with non-surgical lesions were discharged within 2 days. Eighty-three percentage of road transfers were discharged within 3 days. Conclusions Children with small intracranial haematomas and/or skull fractures who need no surgery only require brief inpatient symptomatic treatment and could be safely managed in primary hospitals. Improved tertiary hospital transfer guidelines with protocols to manage clinical deterioration could have cost benefit without risking patient safety.

AB  - Purpose? To discuss the entire spectrum of injuries seen in lower limb trauma and choice of reconstructive options. Methodology? Retrospective review of 72 consecutive cases in one year. Data collected from individual case records and the department photo data base. Injuries were classified and analyzed based on bone and soft tissue involvement, associated vascular injuries, mechanism of injury as in crush, degloving, and combined. Bony injuries were classified according to Gustilo?s classification. Treatment options and outcome for bone and soft tissue are discussed separately. Results? Total of 72 cases. 95%of cases were two wheeler traffic accidents. Distribution of cases according to site involved: Leg-39; Foot-14; Leg and foot-16; Thigh, leg, and foot-3. 8 of them were of Gustilo?s IIIB and 7 of IIIC. 42 flaps done included Gastrocnemius-4, Soleus-7, reverse sural-7, Cross leg-2, Fasciocutaneous-5 Perforator based local flaps-3Latissimus dorsi-7, Gracilis-6 Lateral thigh-1 Intervention: Immediate: 12%. Early (less than 1 week): 36, Delayed (>1 week): 52% Complications:Wound infection:Minor: 12; Major: 8 (3 Cases ? Clostridia) Partial flap loss: 6; Loss of SSG over flap/donor site: 5; Acute renal failure: 1 Amputations: Above knee: 4; below knee: 2 Conclusions? This series represents the spectrum of high velocity injuries in an overcrowded urban locality of developing country. Significant tissue loss is most often the rule. A judicious execution of reconstructive options can optimize results. Management protocols were adopted to avoid delayed referrals. This audit served as a benchmark to put together a dedicated trauma team in our hospital.

AB  - ABSTRACT Communities with major recreational attractions tend to be rural and to have high injury experience both because of environmental hazards unique to rural areas and because they attract urban visitors who may be unfamiliar with the area andits roads, engaging in activities for which they are poorly prepared, and using equipment that is rented, in poor condition, or even of inherently hazardous design or construction. Alcohol abuse by visitors is often aproblem. Once injured, visitors may have difficulty gaining access to emergency care andwhen received, such care may be limited in both quantity and quality. While the influx of visitors to rural areas brings jobs and income, it also may bring crowding, violence, unintentional injury and other stresses. Most rural recreational communities do not actively plan as a community to deal with these problems, but rather approach them piecemeal and with limited communication among all necessary participants. Such planning is essential if progress is to be made.

AB  - Abstract Adolescents are at high risk for violence exposure and initiation of drug use. Co-occurring substance use and trauma exposure are associated with increased risk of mental health disorders, school underachievement, and involvement with multiple systems of care. Coordination and integration of systems of care are of utmost importance for these vulnerable youth. This study delineates the negative sequelae and increased service utilization patterns of adolescents with a history of trauma, substance abuse, and co-occurring trauma and substance abuse to support the need for integrated mental health and substance abuse services for youth. Data from two national sources, the National Child Traumatic Stress Network and Center for Substance Abuse Treatment demonstrate the increased clinical severity (measured by reports of emotional and behavioral problems), dysfunction, and service utilization patterns for youth with co-occurring trauma exposure and substance abuse. We conclude with recommendations for an integrated system of care that includes trauma-informed mental health treatment and substance abuse services aimed at reducing the morbidity and relapse probability of this high-risk group.

AB  - Abstract Drug addiction is a chronic brain disorder with no proven effective cure. Assessing both structural and functional brain alterations by using multi-modal, rather than purely unimodal imaging techniques, may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying addiction, which in turn may facilitate future treatment strategies. However, this type of research remains scarce in the literature. We acquired multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging from 20 cocaine-addicted individuals and 19 age-matched controls. Compared with controls, cocaine addicts showed a multi-modal hypo-status with (1) decreased brain tissue volume in the medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC); (2) hypo-perfusion in the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, right temporal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and (3) reduced irregularity of resting state activity in the OFC and limbic areas, as well as the cingulate, visual and parietal cortices. In the cocaine-addicted brain, larger tissue volume in the medial OFC, anterior cingulate cortex and ventral striatum and smaller insular tissue volume were associated with higher cocaine dependence levels. Decreased perfusion in the amygdala and insula was also correlated with higher cocaine dependence levels. Tissue volume, perfusion, and brain entropy in the insula and prefrontal cortex, all showed a trend of negative correlation with drug craving scores. The three modalities showed voxel-wise correlation in various brain regions, and combining them improved patient versus control brain classification accuracy. These results, for the first time, demonstrate a comprehensive cocaine-dependence and craving-related hypo-status regarding the tissue volume, perfusion and resting brain irregularity in the cocaine-addicted brain.

AB  - Background and Objectives To examine the associations between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, stimulant use, and treatment outcomes among dually diagnosed women. Methods Participants were 141 women who participated in a multisite clinical trial of group treatments for PTSD and addictions. Results Generalized linear models indicated Seeking Safety (SS; a cognitive-behavioral intervention) was significantly more effective than Women's Health Education (WHE; a control group intervention) in reducing stimulant use at follow-up among women who were heavy stimulant users at pre-treatment and who showed improvements in PTSD symptoms. There were no significant differences between the interventions among women who were light stimulant users at treatment entry. Conclusions and Scientific Significance These findings suggest that integrated treatment of co-occurring PTSD and addictions may be more effective than general health education approaches for heavy stimulant users. Assessment of frequency of stimulant use among individuals with PTSD symptoms may inform treatment selection for this population. (Am J Addict 2014;23:90?95)

AB  - Abstract A detailed finite element model of the human kidney for trauma research has been created directly from the National Library of Medicine Visible Human Female (VHF) Project data set. An image segmentation and organ reconstruction software package has been developed and employed to transform the 2D VHF images into a 3D polygonal representation. Non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) surfaces were then mapped to the polygonal surfaces, and were finally utilized to create a robust 3D hexahedral finite element mesh within a commercially available meshing software. The model employs a combined viscoelastic and hyperelastic material model to successfully simulate the behaviour of biological soft tissues. The finite element model was then validated for use in biomechanical research. Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Objectives This study investigated the frequency of traumatic experiences, prevalence rates of ICD-11 post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (CPTSD), and overlap with ICD-10 classified disorders in outpatient psychiatry. Method Overall, 165 Danish psychiatric outpatients answered the International Trauma Questionnaire, the Life Event Checklist, and the World Health Organization Well-being Index. ICD-10 diagnoses were extracted from the hospital record. Chi-square analysis, t-tests, and conditional probability analysis were used for statistical analysis. Results Nearly all patients (94%) had experienced at least one traumatic event. CPTSD (36%) was more common than PTSD (8%) and had considerable overlap with ICD-10 affective, anxiety, PTSD, personality, adjustment and stress-reaction disorders, and behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence. ICD-11 PTSD overlapped with ICD-10 anxiety, PTSD, adjustment and stress-reaction disorders, and behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence. A subgroup of patients with ICD-10 PTSD (23 %) did not meet criteria for ICD-11 PTSD or CPTSD. Conclusion Traumatic experiences are common. ICD-11 CPTSD is a highly prevalent disorder in psychiatric outpatients. One quarter with ICD-10 PTSD did not meet criteria for either ICD-11 PTSD or CPTSD. PTSD and CPTSD had considerable overlap with ICD-10 disorders.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of multi-slice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) enhanced scanning and postprocessing techniques in the diagnosis of arterial root lesions (ARL) in order to improve the understanding and diagnostic accuracy of ARL. We retrospectively analyzed the MSCT imaging findings of 1546 patients. MSCT parameters included the aortic valve annulus level, sinuses of Valsalva level, a sinotubular junction level, ascending aorta, effective diameter, aortic wall thickness, coronary artery height, and coronary sinus depth. The specific measurement method used was curved planar reformation. MSCT found 93 cases of aortic valve disease (AVD). The diagnostic accuracy of MSCT for AVD was 91.7% (33/36). MSCT found 95 cases of acute aortic syndrome involving the aortic root, 71 of which were Stanford type A-aortic dissection (AD), 22 cases of Stanford type A-interstitial hematoma (IHM), and two cases of penetrating aortic ulcers (PAU). MSCT diagnosed Stanford type A-AD, Stanford type A-IHM, and PAU had a specificity of 99.8% and a sensitivity of 98.9%. In conclusion, MSCT enhanced scanning and postprocessing techniques can accurately display the aortic root and adjacent structures, with clear positioning and high diagnostic accuracy, which can provide important basis for clinical diagnosis, preoperative localization, and postoperative follow-up.
