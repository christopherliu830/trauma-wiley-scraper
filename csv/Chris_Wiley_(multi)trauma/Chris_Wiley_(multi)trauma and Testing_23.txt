AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of multi-slice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) enhanced scanning and postprocessing techniques in the diagnosis of arterial root lesions (ARL) in order to improve the understanding and diagnostic accuracy of ARL. We retrospectively analyzed the MSCT imaging findings of 1546 patients. MSCT parameters included the aortic valve annulus level, sinuses of Valsalva level, a sinotubular junction level, ascending aorta, effective diameter, aortic wall thickness, coronary artery height, and coronary sinus depth. The specific measurement method used was curved planar reformation. MSCT found 93 cases of aortic valve disease (AVD). The diagnostic accuracy of MSCT for AVD was 91.7% (33/36). MSCT found 95 cases of acute aortic syndrome involving the aortic root, 71 of which were Stanford type A-aortic dissection (AD), 22 cases of Stanford type A-interstitial hematoma (IHM), and two cases of penetrating aortic ulcers (PAU). MSCT diagnosed Stanford type A-AD, Stanford type A-IHM, and PAU had a specificity of 99.8% and a sensitivity of 98.9%. In conclusion, MSCT enhanced scanning and postprocessing techniques can accurately display the aortic root and adjacent structures, with clear positioning and high diagnostic accuracy, which can provide important basis for clinical diagnosis, preoperative localization, and postoperative follow-up.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To describe haemodynamic resuscitation practices in ED patients with suspected sepsis and hypotension. Methods This was a prospective, multicentre, observational study conducted in 70 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand between September 2018 and January 2019. Consecutive adults presenting to the ED during a 30-day period at each site, with suspected sepsis and hypotension (systolic blood pressure?<100?mmHg) despite at least 1000?mL fluid resuscitation, were eligible. Data included baseline demographics, clinical and laboratory variables and intravenous fluid volume administered, vasopressor administration at baseline and 6- and 24-h post-enrolment, time to antimicrobial administration, intensive care admission, organ support and in-hospital mortality. Results A total of 4477 patients were screened and 591 were included with a mean (standard deviation) age of 62 (19) years, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score 15.2 (6.6) and a median (interquartile range) systolic blood pressure of 94?mmHg (87?100). Median time to first intravenous antimicrobials was 77?min (42?148). A vasopressor infusion was commenced within 24?h in 177 (30.2%) patients, with noradrenaline the most frequently used (n = 138, 78%). A median of 2000?mL (1500?3000) of intravenous fluids was administered prior to commencing vasopressors. The total volume of fluid administered from pre-enrolment to 24?h was 4200?mL (3000?5661), with a range from 1000 to 12?200?mL. Two hundred and eighteen patients (37.1%) were admitted to an intensive care unit. Overall in-hospital mortality was 6.2% (95% confidence interval 4.4?8.5%). Conclusion Current resuscitation practice in patients with sepsis and hypotension varies widely and occupies the spectrum between a restricted volume/earlier vasopressor and liberal fluid/later vasopressor strategy.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has a poorly understood pathology. Patients suffer from a variety of physical and cognitive effects that worsen as the type of trauma worsens. Some noninvasive insights into the pathophysiology of TBI are possible using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and many other forms of imaging as well. A recent workshop was convened to evaluate the common data elements (CDEs) that cut across the imaging field and given the charge to review the contributions of the various imaging modalities to TBI and to prepare an overview of the various clinical manifestations of TBI and their interpretation. Technical details regarding state-of-the-art protocols for both MRI and CT are also presented with the hope of guiding current and future research efforts as to what is possible in the field. Stress was also placed on the potential to create a database of CDEs as a means to best record information from a given patient from the reading of the images. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Objectives To report surgical technique, intra- and post-operative complications, and short- and long-term outcome following canine hepatobiliary surgery in which exposure of intra-abdominal hepatobiliary lesions was aided by diaphragmotomy. Materials and Methods Clinical records from four multi-disciplinary UK-based small animal referral hospitals were retrospectively reviewed for dogs in which diaphragmotomy was performed between January 2014 and May 2019. Signalment, diagnosis, surgery performed, diaphragmotomy technique, management of diaphragmotomy and pneumothorax, intra- and post-operative complications, short-term outcome and long-term outcome were recorded. Results Thirty-one cases were identified. The most common hepatobiliary surgeries performed alongside diaphragmotomy were single hepatic lobectomy (14/31) and cholecystectomy (11/31). The most common diagnoses were hepatocellular carcinoma (10/31), gall bladder mucocoele (7/31) and hepatic nodular hyperplasia (4/31). Peri-operative mortality rate was 9.7% (3/31 cases) though none of these deaths were considered attributable to diaphragmotomy. Post-operative complications were encountered in 67.9% (19/28) cases that survived the peri-operative period, of which 25.0% (7/28) suffered complications that were considered attributable or likely attributable to diaphragmotomy. These seven complications resolved following non-surgical intervention. Follow-up was available for 26 of 28 patients that survived to discharge at a median of 4-months (range 10?days to 24?months) following surgery and revealed no evidence of complications related to diaphragmotomy. Clinical Significance Diaphragmotomy appears safe and increases abdominal exposure of hepatobiliary lesions. The benefit of improved exposure must be carefully weighed up against the risks inherent in inducing pneumothorax.

AB  - Purpose:?? Currently there are no standards for testing efficacy of medical device cleaners. With fears of prion transmission, reliable protein on medical devices needs to be minimised. Aim:?? To develop a reliable test to detect efficacy of biofilm removal which can be used as an industry standard. Methodology:?? A bioreactor model was used to grow a characterised Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain on Teflon coupons. The coupons were subjected to various cleaners. Residual biofilm was detected by either a crystal violet assay (CV) or protein assay (PA). The % reduction of biofilm was compared to controls including analysis of variance and student t-tests. Each experiment was repeated three times. Inter and intra-experimental comparisons were made. Visual confirmation of the results was by confocal microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Results:?? NaOH 1% 40C for 30?min: CV 87.3% ± 5.4, PA 92.0% ± 2.3; NaOH 0.01N 70C for 5?min: PA 28.4% ± 2.7; Tween20 40C for 30?min: CV 25.1 ± 2.7, PA 14.5 ± 5.7 (not significant). Some representative commercial cleaners were tested. Matrix: CV 10.5% ± 3.7, PA 27.9% ± 3.0; RMEC 70500: CV 69.0% ± 4.5, PA 85.9% ± 2.9; Zen: PA 105.8% ± 1.5 (i.e. treatment coupons were cleaner than background coupons). All treatments were significant p < 0.05 except for Tween20, which was not consistently significant. There was no significant inter-experimental difference for % reduction. Conclusions:?? We have developed a reproducible method for testing efficacy of cleaning products against biofilm incorporating the use of crystal violet or protein assay to measure residual biofilm protein.

AB  - This multi-center study evaluated guided tissue regeneration (GTR) in Class II furcation defects using a polylactic acid biodegradable barrier in 29 patients with mandibular and maxillary molar defects. Following an initial hygienic phase, surgical flaps were elevated, and the sites scaled and root planed. Furcation defect perimeter was measured and a customized barrier (thickness 600 to 750 ?) was applied to cover the defect. Barriers adhered directly to tooth and bone. At baseline, sites were measured for probing depth (PD) (6.0 ± 0.2 [SE] mm), gingival margin location (GML) (?0.2 ± 0.2 mm), and attachment level in both vertical (AL-V) (6.2 ± 0.2 mm) and horizontal (AL-H) (5.4 ± 0.2 mm) directions. After the surgical procedure, there was good compatibility between the gingival tissues and barrier material. Clinically, barriers fragmented and became displaced in 3 to 6 weeks. Substantial granulation tissue was sometimes present between barrier and root surfaces. Comprehensive periodontal examination parameters were measured 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after baseline. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to evaluate changes from baseline. At 6 and 12 months postsurgery, GML was close to the presurgical level (?0.5 ± 0.2 mm). There was clinically and statistically significant improvement in all other parameters: mean PD reduction (2.2 mm), AL-V gain (1.7 mm), and AL-H gain (2.5 mm). These results indicated favorable clinical regenerative outcomes after using this barrier material in Class II furcation defects in humans. J Periodontol 1995; 66:377?385.

AB  - Background: There is a lack of studies showing the overall impact of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) on the treatment of critically ill patients in a general intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Methods: A prospective observational study on the effects of MDCT on the treatment of patients in a 12-bed medical?surgical ICU in a university hospital providing tertiary care. Results: During the 9-month study period, there were 343 admissions with ICU length of stay longer than 48?h. Of these patients, 64 (19%) had had inconclusive findings with other modalities of radiological imaging, and they underwent altogether 82 MDCT examinations. Fifty examinations (61%) resulted in a change of treatment. The changes included 22 surgical interventions, 16 percutaneous or paranasal interventions, 15 changes of antimicrobial therapy, three withdrawals of active treatment, and four other changes of treatment. Eight patients underwent two and one patient underwent three changes of treatment. Twenty examinations (24%) were regarded as otherwise necessary for clinical decision-making, although no change in the treatment was indicated. Twelve examinations (15%) failed to provide any additional information relevant to the patient's treatment. Conclusion: Sixty-one percent of the MDCT examinations led to a change of treatment, and 24% of them otherwise contributed to or supported clinical decision-making, suggesting that MDCT examination is helpful in the case of general ICU patients, with inconclusive findings with other imaging modalities.

Treatment strategies were classified and outcomes after a 6-month period presented. The study population comprised 76 patients (between the ages of 2 and 55 years) with 93 root fractures in their teeth (18 primary, 75 permanent). Data were collected following the taking of a detailed clinical history, objective clinical examination and photographic and radiological investigation. Since most of the primary teeth were extracted, only cases with root fracture of permanent teeth were followed-up: in all, 24 patients with 31 teeth with root fractures. The prevalence of root fractures in permanent teeth was 7.7% of all injuries, while in primary teeth it was 3.8%. The most frequently involved teeth were the maxillary incisors with a percentage of 75% in permanent teeth. Moreover, 40% of root fractures in permanent teeth were associated with fracture of the alveolar bone and of the soft tissues and in 45% of cases, the adjacent teeth were also injured. The results of this study reaffirm the necessity for scrupulous diagnosis of teeth after a traumatic injury. Adjacent teeth and those in the opposing arch should not be ignored. Treatment is multi-disciplinary, requiring surgical, orthodontic, operative and prosthetic compliance. Periodic check-up is essential.

AB  - Developing ways to manage terrorism effectively requires a better understanding of how the public perceives this threat. In the present study, Canadians' perceptions of terrorism risk and 4 other hazards were assessed using a word-association technique and rating scales reflecting key cognitive dimensions of risk (threat, uncertainty, control) and worry reactions. Data were collected in a national telephone survey. Canadians perceived terrorism as posing a lower threat, as more uncertain, and as less controllable, compared to the other hazards. Positive associations of perceived threat and of perceived uncertainty with worry about terrorism were observed. However, perceived control was unexpectedly positively associated with worry about terrorism. The findings also suggest that additional social contextual factors should be examined in future research.

AB  - Abstract An increasing emphasis has been placed across health care on evidence-based medicine with higher level studies, such as randomized trials and prospective cohort studies. Historically, clinical research in orthopaedic surgery has been dominated by studies with low patient numbers from a limited number of surgeons. The purpose of this study was to test our hypothesis that orthopaedics has fewer multi-center collaborative studies as compared to other medical disciplines. We chose three leading journals from general medicine, a leading journal from the surgical subspecialties of obstetrics and gynecology, ophthalmology and otolaryngology, and three leading journals from orthopaedic surgery based on highest impact factor. We compared the percentage of collaborative studies and the number of contributing institutions and authors in original research manuscripts published in 2009 between general medical, surgical subspecialty and orthopaedic surgery journals. A significantly higher percentage of manuscripts resulted from multicenter collaborative efforts in the general medical literature (p?<?0.000001) and the other surgical subspecialty literature (p?<?0.000001) compared to the orthopaedic surgery literature. Manuscripts published in the general medical journals came from more institutions (p?<?0.0001) and had significantly more authors (p?<?0.000001) than those published in the orthopaedic surgery journals. There is an opportunity to stimulate greater multicenter collaborative research, which correlates with increased patient numbers, a higher level of evidence and more generalizable findings, in the orthopaedic surgery community. These efforts can be supported through increased funding, surgeon participation, and appropriate expansion of authorship for multicenter studies in orthopaedic journals. ? 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract??? It is important that mouthguards have an adequate thickness of material if they are to be effective in the prevention of trauma. The aim of this study was to quantify dimensional changes that occur on thermoforming ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) sheets used in the construction of mouthguards. Fourteen batches of 3?mm thick sheet EVA were thermoformed over dental models under a number of common processing conditions including, model height, inclination, shape and model temperature, model position on thermoforming platform, plasticizing time and evacuation method. Thickness of thermoformed material was determined at anterior and posterior sites and measurements were compared to determine the magnitude and patterns of stretching collectively and within each processing condition. Overall, sheets of 3-mm EVA stretched by 52% during the thermoforming conditions tested. Incisal/cuspal sites were found to be significantly thinner when compared with all other locations measured. A number of thermoforming conditions were demonstrated to have a significant effect on the degree to which the EVA material stretched. For the combination of materials and equipment tested in this study, current thermoforming practices may cause excessive thinning of EVA in critical areas including incisal edges and cusp tips, thereby reducing the protective effect for professionally made mouthguards. To optimize protection in vulnerable areas, it is important that clinicians distinguish between EVA sheet thickness and the cross-sectional dimensions achieved in the finished mouthguards. They need to be specific in their prescription of the thickness of material they require especially in critical areas.

AB  - Background: We investigated the incidence and severity of post-injury morbidity and mortality in intensive care unit (ICU)-treated trauma patients. We also identified risk factors in the early phase after injury that predicted the later development of complications. Methods: A prospective observational cohort study design was used. One hundred and sixty-four adult patients admitted to the ICU for more than 24?h were included during a 21-month period. The incidence and severity of morbidity such as multiple organ failure (MOF), acute lung injury (ALI), severe sepsis and 30-day post-injury mortality were calculated and risk factors were analyzed with uni- and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: The median age was 40 years, the injury severity score was 24, the new injury severity score was 29, the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score was 15, sequential organ failure assessment maximum was 7 and ICU length of stay was 3.1 days. The incidences of post-injury MOF were 40.2%, ALI 25.6%, severe sepsis 31.1% and 30-day mortality 10.4%. The independent risk factors differed to some extent between the outcome parameters. Age, severity of injury, significant head injury and massive transfusion were independent risk factors for several outcome parameters. Positive blood alcohol was only a predictor of MOF, whereas prolonged rescue time only predicted death. Unexpectedly, injury severity was not an independent risk factor for mortality. Conclusions: Although the incidence of morbidity was considerable, mortality was relatively low. Early post-injury risk factors that predicted later development of complications differed between morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Abstract Background: This study was undertaken to measure survival of patients with multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma treated by cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy through a multi-institutional collaboration. Methods: A multi-institutional data registry, established by the Peritoneal Surface Oncology Group, was used to identify patients with peritoneal mesothelioma and the subgroup with multicystic tumours, treated by cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Outcomes for this subgroup are reported. The primary endpoint was overall survival. A secondary endpoint was the incidence of treatment-related complications. Results: Of 405 patients with peritoneal mesothelioma, 26 (6·4 per cent) had multicystic tumours. There were 20 women and six men with a mean(s.d.) age of 42(12) years. The median peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) was 14 (range 6?39). There was no perioperative mortality. Six patients developed grade III or IV complications. After a median follow-up of 54 (range 5?129) months, all 26 patients were still alive. Conclusion: Multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma appears to be a distinct subtype of peritoneal mesothelioma, where long-term survival may be achieved through cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.
