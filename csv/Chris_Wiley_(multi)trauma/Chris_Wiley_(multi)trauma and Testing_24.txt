AB  - Abstract Objective Blood pressure (BP) cuffs are potential vectors for transmission of multi-resistant organisms (MROs). The present study aims to determine MRO colonisation rates in BP cuffs from areas of high patient flow as an assessment of the quality of disinfection and infection control practices. Methods BP cuffs in the ED, high dependency unit (HDU) and operating theatres (OT) were prospectively examined after routine disinfection procedures. Swabs collected from the inner and outer surfaces of BP cuffs during inter-patient intervals were plated onto replicate organism detection and counting, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) chromogenic agar plates to detect rates of bacterial, MRSA and VRE colonisation, respectively. Results High bacterial colonisation rates were detected in BP cuffs from all three areas. BP cuffs from OT were significantly less colonised compared with cuffs from HDU and ED; 76% versus 96% and 100% (P < 0.0001) for inner surfaces and 86% versus 98% and 100% (P < 0.0001) for outer surfaces, respectively. Equivalent or higher bacterial growth was observed on the inner surface compared with outer surface in 54%, 84% and 86% of BP cuffs from OT, HDU and ED, respectively. MRSA was detected in 3 of 150 (2%) swabs collected, but no VRE was detected. Conclusion Although MRSA and VRE were infrequently isolated, current disinfection and infection control protocols need to be improved given the greater recovery of organisms from the inner compared with outer surfaces of BP cuffs.

AB  - Abstract Objectives/Hypothesis: To define the prevalence of tracheotomy tube complications and evaluate risk factors (RFs) associated with their occurrence. Study Design: Multi-institution historical cohort. Methods: Data regarding tracheotomy tube complications from consecutive surgeries performed across eight participating institutions between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2009 were retrospectively collected. Patient demographics, comorbidities, physician specialty, and surgical technique were recorded and statistically analyzed to identify the incidence of surgical complications following tracheotomy and associated RFs. Results: The charts of 1,175 tracheotomy procedures were reviewed from eight academic institutions. Otolaryngologists performed 66.2% of the tracheotomies. Intraoperative, early (<1 week), and late complication rates were 1.4%, 5.6%, and 7.1%, respectively. Postoperative bleeding was identified as the most common early complication (2.6%), whereas airway stenosis was the most common late complication (1.7%). The use of outer flange security sutures to anchor the tracheostomy tube was negatively associated with the incidence of early complication (P < .0001). The use of large endotracheal tubes (size >7.5) and obesity were associated with the development of airway stenosis (P < .05).Twenty-two percent of patients undergoing tracheotomy died during hospitalization. Conclusions: Perioperative tracheotomy complications are rare; however, the rate of death for all causes is high (22%) in this population. Obesity and the use of endotracheal tubes over 7.5 in size are major risk factors for the development of airway stenosis. Although percutaneous tracheotomy resulted in a significantly higher rate of postoperative bleeding (6.6%) than the open method (1.9%) (P < .05), the use of outer flange tracheostomy tube sutures may reduce this complication.Laryngoscope, 122:38?45, 2012

AB  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as delusions and misidentifications have been reported in dementia ranging from 10% to 73% in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and up to 40% in multi-infarct dementia (MID) patients. The aim of this study was to investigate in 61 AD and 31 MID patients both the frequency and the content of delusions during the course of illness and to evaluate the relationship between these and both functional and mental decline. The results indicated that delusion experiences had occurred in 45% of AD patients and in 38% of MID patients, occurring most frequently during the first year of illness. Patients who experienced psychiatric symptoms showed higher mini mental state examination scores and were less impaired in functional disability measures. With regard to the content, no significant differences were observed between AD and MID patients; 53% of psychotic symptoms were found to be paranoid delusions while 47% were misidentification delusions.

AB  - Introduction: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in dogs with urinary catheters in intensive care units (ICUs) are frequent. Historically, multi-drug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli account for about 10% of the UTIs. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of E. coli infections and of MDR E. coli in dogs with UTIs in our ICU, and to assess whether the MDR E. coli were community-acquired or nosocomial in origin. Methods: Over a 1-year period, rectal swabs were taken from all dogs in the ICU on the day of admission (D0) and on days 3 (D3), 6 (D6), 9 (D9) and 12 (D12). Urine was collected on these days from dogs with an indwelling urinary catheter (n=190). Rectal swabs and urine were routinely cultured. E. coli isolates were identified by biochemical tests. Using NCCLS guidelines, antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by disk diffusion method on fecal and urinary E. coli isolates. Twelve antimicrobial agents were used: nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin, and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to compare MDR E. coli UTI strains with fecal E. coli strains from the same patient and with MDR fecal E. coli from patients that were adjacent to, or housed in the same cages. Results: E. coli was cultured from 12 (48%) of 25 UTIs. Two of the E. coli were MDR. For one dog, PFGE showed no similarities among fecal E. coli and the urinary MDR E. coli isolates from the patient or between these isolates and fecal E. coli from a dog housed in the same kennel on the previous day. The MDR E. coli UTI was likely acquired prior to admission to the ICU, as it was present on D0. For the other dog, PFGE showed genetic similarity but not complete identity between the D3 MDR E. coli urinary isolate and the D3, D6, D9 fecal MDR isolates. This suggests that the UTI originated with the fecal E. coli. Using selective plates, fecal MDR E. coli were not found on D0. Selection of the MDR strain in the intestine by the use of antibiotics occurred while the dog was in the ICU and possibly led to the UTI. Conclusions: Multi-drug resistant E. coli accounted for 2 of 12 E. coli UTIs in dogs in the ICU over a 1-year period. Genotyping showed that one of the two MDR E. coli infections could possibly be of nosocomial origin.

AB  - Abstract About 10 % of infertile/subfertile women are diagnosed with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR), of which?<?5 % will become pregnant spontaneously. Fragile X (FMR1) genetic testing may provide a reason for her early ovarian aging and/or have reproductive implications. Seven women with DOR (genetic study subset) and the male partners of six of these women were separately interviewed about the experience of being asked to undergo this unanticipated genetic test. Three interviews were conducted (before, within 1 week after, and 3 months after learning the test results). None of the participants carried the FMR1 premutation (largest FMR1 allele 27?50 CGG repeats). For women, their pregnancy-seeking journey was long and exhausting. Women understood the reproductive implications of carrying the FMR1 premutation, and hoped for a negative result. Being offered a genetic test caused women to pause and re-think their future reproductive plans. Husbands viewed the infertility journey as filled with unknowns, of which the genetic test results would be one more puzzle piece. The expense of fertility testing/treatment was mentioned by both spouses, though more notably by husbands. The introduction of a possible genetic cause of infertility, with additional potential health consequences for future biological children, caused women to re-think their quest for pregnancy. In contrast, the genetic test was viewed as an additional source of information for their husbands as opposed to raising concern regarding potential reproductive ramifications.

AB  - Abstract We have previously shown that treatment with a mGluR5 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) is neuroprotective after experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI), limiting post-traumatic neuroinflammation by reducing pro-inflammatory microglial activation and promoting anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective responses. However, the specific molecular mechanisms governing this anti-inflammatory shift in microglia remain unknown. Here we show that the mGluR5 PAM, VU0360172 (VuPAM), regulates microglial inflammatory responses through activation of Akt, resulting in the inhibition of GSK-3?. GSK-3? regulates the phosphorylation of CREB, thereby controlling the expression of inflammation-related genes and microglial plasticity. The anti-inflammatory action of VuPAM in microglia is reversed by inhibiting Akt/GSK-3?/CREB signaling. Using a well-characterized TBI model and CX3CR1gfp/+ mice to visualize microglia in vivo, we demonstrate that VuPAM enhances Akt/GSK-3?/CREB signaling in the injured cortex, as well as anti-inflammatory microglial markers. Furthermore, in situ analysis revealed that GFP + microglia in the cortex of VuPAM-treated TBI mice co-express pCREB and the anti-inflammatory microglial phenotype marker YM1. Taken together, our data show that VuPAM decreases pro-inflammatory microglial activation by modulating Akt/GSK-3?/CREB signaling. These findings serve to clarify the potential neuroprotective mechanisms of mGluR5 PAM treatment after TBI, and suggest novel therapeutic targets for post-traumatic neuroinflammation.

AB  - Abstract Objective: Traumatic brain injuries (TBI), which are mostly due to road traffic crash (RTC), are a major public health concern. This article describes the incidence, severity and outcome of TBI caused by RTC in New Caledonia over a five-year period. Methods: Data of all individuals admitted in intensive care unit with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤8 at admission) caused by RTC in New Caledonia from 2008 to 2012 were analysed. Causes and severity of trauma, demographic data, and short-term as well as last available long-term outcome of patients were analysed. Five types of road users were compared (car drivers, car passengers, motorcyclists, bicyclists and pedestrians). Outcome was defined according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale classification. Results: A total of 109 patients were included in the study. The median age of patients was 24 [IQR18?33] years with a sex ratio of 2.8 (80 men/29 women). The rate of 44 among Melanesian males was two times higher that among 16 European males (22/100,000 people vs 11/100,000 people). The total survival at the Intensive Care Unit discharge (short-term outcome) was 84%, being the highest among passengers (88%) and the lowest among motorcyclists (69%). Of the patients tested for psychoactive substances, half tested positive. Lost to follow-up rate was 67%. Conclusion: Poor outcome occurs in patients with RTC-related TBI, with young Melanesian men being the most affected. Public health action should focus on this group using culturally appropriate messages.

AB  - Aim Previous research has demonstrated a strong association between early trauma exposure and the development of psychotic symptoms. However, few of these studies have included young adolescents and children. This study investigated rates and number of potentially traumatic experiences (PTEs) among typically developing youth (TD; n = 21), youth at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR; n = 38), and youth with a psychotic disorder (PD; n = 28) between 7 and 18 years of age. CHR participants were further evaluated to determine whether a history of PTEs was associated with prodromal symptom severity. Methods Study group inclusion was determined by structured interviews. Trauma history was assessed using the post-traumatic stress disorder module of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children?Present and Lifetime Version. CHR participants with vs without a history of PTEs were compared on severity of prodromal symptoms. Results CHR and PD participants reported significantly higher rates and numbers of PTEs than TD participants. Contrary to expectations and prior research, CHR participants with vs without a history of PTEs did not differ in prodromal symptom severity. Explanations and implications for the findings are discussed. Conclusions These findings suggest that the relationship between trauma and the development of psychotic symptoms extends to children and adolescents as young as 7 years of age. This study underscores the importance of screening for trauma exposure among youth seeking treatment for psychotic symptoms.

AB  - Abstract Objective: The purpose of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate peri-implant soft-tissue conditions and esthetic fulfillment during a 3-year follow-up period following prosthetic rehabilitation. Material and methods: As part of a prospective multi-center study, 152 ITI dental implants were placed in 80 patients in the maxillary anterior region. Fifty-nine crowns (38.82%) were cement retained, while 93 (61.18%) crowns were screw retained. At loading and 3, 6, 12 and 36 months post-loading, modified plaque index (MPI), sulcus bleeding index (SBI), keratinized mucosa (KM), gingival level (GL), and esthetic fulfillment were recorded. Results: All patients completed the study and no complications were reported. While statistically not significant at all time points, cement-retained crowns seemed to present a worsening trend in MPI and SBI scores. Interestingly, screw-retained crowns seemed to present an opposite picture, their MPI and SBI scores improved over time. While plaque accumulation, prophylaxis and depth of crown margin significantly affected levels of sulcus bleeding, prophylaxis alone played a key role in reducing plaque accumulation. No soft tissue recession was observed in either cement- or screw-retained crowns up to 3 years post-loading. Esthetic fulfillment survey revealed that patients did not have a preference for crown types; however, dentists favored cement-retained over screw-retained crowns. Conclusions: Peri-implant soft tissues responded more favorably to screw-retained crowns when compared with cement-retained crowns. However, no soft-tissue recession was observed in either type of crowns. Cement-retained crowns were preferred by dentists, while patients were equally satisfied with either type of crowns they received.

AB  - The reproducibility of skin prick tests under field conditions is essential for comparing prevalences between centers in epidemiologic multicenter studies. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the reproducibility of two widely used skin prick test devices: the Multi-Test and the ALK lancet. The subjects were 28 children, aged 6?14 years, with known sensitivities Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (D. pter). Both devices were applied to each subject on two occasions, 1 week apart, by different, randomly assigned fieldworkers, using histamine, negative control, and the D. pter. allergen extract. For all three tested solutions, mean wheal sizes were larger for the Multi-Test than for the ALK lancet. The coefficient of variation for histamine was 21.8% for the Multi-Test and 17.3% for the ALK lancet. The coefficients of variation for the allergen D. pter. amounted to 47.4% for the Multi-Test and to 24.6% for the ALK lancet. The percentage of concordant test results was 92.6% for the Multi-Test and 100.0% for the ALK lancet for a cutoff point of wheal size equal to or greater than 1 mm. The results of this study suggest that the single ALK lancet performs slightly better than the Multi-Test device with respect to reproducibility under conditions of epidemiologic field studies.

AB  - Purpose: To compare calculated effective doses for pediatric CT exams using the new and old ICRP recommendations. Methods and Materials: A total of 178 pediatric patients who underwent trauma CT studies were analyzed retrospectively. Subjects were divided into 6 groups according to the type of exams performed, ranging from only a head scan to a full body assessment (head/face/neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis). Two versions of ImPACT software (ImPACT CT, version 0.99x & 1.0) were used to analyze study data and extract the effective dose: the older version used ICRP-60 to calculate effective doses whereas ImPACT 1.0 used ICRP-103 recommendations. The correction factors for pediatrics, which are included in spreadsheet, were applied to obtain the equivalent pediatric effective dose. A paired student's t-test was used with significance threshold set at 0.01. Results: Pediatric effective doses using ICRP 103 were found to be significantly different from those calculated with ICRP 60 (p < 0.01) for the following scan groups: head/neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis, head/chest/abdomen/pelvis, head/neck, head/face, and head only. The difference in effective doses of full body group (head/face/neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis) was not found to be significant (p = 0.035).Conclusion: Our analysis showed that the calculated effective doses from CT studies using the newer ICRP 103 differed significantly from the old ICRP recommendations. The only scans which did not exhibit significant difference (p>0.01) were when face scans were included in the ?full body? scan. This is probably due to the fact that the new tissue weighting factors of face organs did not change significantly from ICRP-60. However, when only a head and face scans were performed, the difference was found to be highly significant most likely because of the inclusion of the brain and salivary glands, which accounted for a larger contribution of the received doses from head than face scan, in the new ICRP weighting factors.

AB  - Abstract Aim Single port (SP) ileocaecal resection (ICR) is an established technique but there are no large studies comparing SP and multi-port (MP) laparoscopic surgery in Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to compare postoperative pain scores and analgesia requirements after SP and MP laparoscopic ICR for CD. Method This was a retrospective study of patients undergoing SP or MP ICR for CD in three tertiary referral centres from February 1999 to October 2014. Baseline characteristics (age, sex, body mass index and indication for surgery) were compared. Primary end-points were postoperative pain scores, analgesia requirements and short-term postoperative outcomes. Results SP ICR (n = 101) and MP ICR (n = 156) patients were included in the study. Visual analogue scale scores were significantly lower after SP ICR on postoperative day 1 (P = 0.016) and day 2 (P = 0.04). Analgesia requirements were significantly reduced on postoperative day 2 in the SP group compared with the MP group (P = 0.007). Duration of surgery, conversion to open surgery and stoma rates were comparable between the two groups. Surgery was more complex in terms of additional procedures when MP was adopted (P = 0.001). There were no differences in postoperative complication rates, postoperative food intake, length of stay and readmissions. Conclusion These data suggest that in comparison to standard laparoscopic surgery SP ICR might be less painful and patients might require less opioid analgesia.

AB  - Objective Exposure to sexual assault is a significant risk factor to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in females. The early neurobiological changes leading to the development of PTSD remain understudied and unclear in this population. Methods Participants were 27 adult females recruited within a month following exposure to sexual assault (T1) and 20 age-matched non-exposed controls. Among the victims, 10 participants met (PTSD+) and 15 did not meet (PTSD?) DSM-IV criteria for PTSD 6 months post-trauma (T2). At both visits, hippocampal and amygdala volumes were extracted from magnetic resonance imaging scans, and indices of total diurnal cortisol changes were derived from individual areas under the curve relative to the ground (AUCg). Measures at T1 were compared between groups at T1, measures at T2 between groups at T2, and measures at T1 between groups at T2. Results At T1, victims had significantly smaller bilateral hippocampal volumes, but not AUCg, than controls. At T2, neither hippocampal volume nor AUCg significantly differed among the groups. However, the PTSD+ group had significantly smaller hippocampal volumes at T1 than the control group, but not compared to the PTSD? group. Conclusions This study indicates that having smaller hippocampal volumes is a risk factor to develop PTSD in females exposed to sexual assault.

AB  - Abstract With the growing elusiveness of the state apparatus in late modernity, military service is one of the last institutions to be clearly identified with the state, its ideologies and its policies. Therefore, negotiations between the military and its recruits produce acting subjects of citizenship with long-lasting consequences. Arguing that these negotiations are regulated by multi-level (civic, group, and individual) contracts, we explore the various meanings that these contracts obtain at the intersectionality of gender, class, and ethnicity; and examine how they shape the subjective experience of soldierhood and citizenship. More particularly, we analyse the meaning of military service in the retrospective life stories of Israeli Jewish women from various ethno-class backgrounds who served as army secretaries ? a low-status, feminine gender-typed occupation within a hyper-masculine organization. Findings reveal that for women of the lower class, the organizing cultural schema of the multi-level contract is that of achieving respectability through military service, which means being included in the national collective. Conversely, for middle-class women, it is the sense of entitlement that shapes their contract with the military, which they expect to signify and maintain their privileged status. Thus, while for the lower class, the multi-level contract is about inclusion within the boundaries of the national collective, for the dominant groups, this contract is about reproducing social class hierarchies within national boundaries.

AB  - Summary The objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of apoptosis of monocytes in an experimental model of multiple trauma and its probable correlation to bacterial translocation. Thirty-two rabbits were applied in three groups: A, controls; B, myotomy of the right femur; and C, myotomy and fracture of the right femur. Blood was sampled for the estimation of endotoxins [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)], tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, malondialdehyde (MDA) and isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs, derived after centrifugation over Ficoll, were incubated in flasks and apoptosis of non-adherent lymphocytes and adherent monocytes was estimated after staining for Annexin-V and flow cytometry. TNF-α of supernatants of cultured monocytes was also determined. Tissue segments were cultured after death. Median survival of groups A, B and C was?>?14,?>?14 and 9·00?days, respectively. Apoptosis of lymphocytes in group C was higher than group A at 2, 4 and 48 h and of monocytes in group C higher than group A at 2 and 4 hours. LPS in group C was higher than group A at 2, 4 and 48?h. Apoptosis of lymphocytes and monocytes was correlated positively with serum TNF-α and negatively with TNF-α of monocyte supernatants. Cultures of organ segments of group A were sterile. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from liver, lung and spleen in five animals in group B (45·45%) and in six in group C (54·54%). Early apoptosis of blood monocytes supervened after multiple trauma; the phenomenon was accompanied by apoptosis of blood lymphocytes and subsequent bacterial translocation.

Journal of Advanced Nursing66(3), 664?672. Abstract Aim.? This paper is a report of a study conducted to translate the Disaster Preparedness Evaluation Tool? into Arabic and to determine its psychometric properties, including reliability, validity and factorial structure. Background.? Worldwide numbers of natural and man-made disasters have greatly increased in recent years. Since disaster strikes without warning, all healthcare providers, especially nurses, must be prepared with appropriate skills and resources for disaster procedures and management during the three phases of disaster: pre disaster, during disaster and post disaster. Knowledge levels need to be evaluated to plan effective educational programmes. Methods.? The Disaster Preparedness Evaluation Tool? was translated into Classical Arabic using Beaton?s guideline for translation and validated by experts and a pilot study with 20 Registered Nurses from the target population. Data were collected in 2008 using self-administered questionnaires from 474 (79% return rate) Jordanian Registered Nurses who worked in randomly selected Ministry of Health hospitals and two university hospitals. Results.? Principal component analysis (Promax rotation with Kaiser Normalization procedure, SPSS? version 15) was used to determined construct validity, and three factors explained 64% of the variance: knowledge, skills and post disaster management. Cronbach?s alpha was 0·90, which demonstrated internal consistency. Conclusion.? These results support the reliability and validity of the Disaster Preparedness Evaluation Tool? as a measure of knowledge, skills and post disaster management. It can be used with confidence with an Arabic-speaking nursing population to measure their preparedness for disasters. Based on the results of such studies, effective disaster preparedness programmes could be developed to enhance nurses? disaster preparedness.

AB  - Abstract We have previously reported neuroprotection in spinal cord injury (SCI) by Lipitor [atorvastatin (AT)]-pre-treatment. Though informative, pre-treatment studies find only limited clinical application as trauma occurrence is unpredictable. Therefore, this study investigates the efficacy of AT treatment post-SCI. In a rat model of contusion-SCI resulting in complete hindlimb paralysis, AT treatment (5?mg/kg; gavage) was begun 2, 4, or 6?h post-SCI followed by a once daily dose thereafter for 6?weeks. While the placebo vehicle (VHC)-SCI rats showed substantial functional deficit, AT-SCI animals exhibited significant functional recovery. AT diminished injury-induced blood?spinal cord barrier (BSCB) dysfunction with significantly reduced infiltration and tumor necrosis factor-α/interleukin-1?/inducible nitric oxide synthase expression at site of injury. BSCB protection in AT-SCI was attributable to attenuated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) expression ? a central player in BSCB disruption. Furthermore, endothelial MMP9 expression was found to be RhoA/ROCK pathway-mediated and regulated by AT through an isoprenoid-dependent mechanism. Attenuation of these early inflammatory events reduced secondary damage. Significant reduction in axonal degeneration, myelin degradation, gliosis, and neuronal apoptosis with resultant enhancement in tissue sparing was observed in AT-SCI compared with VHC-SCI. In summary, this novel report presenting the efficacy of post-injury AT treatment might be of critical therapeutic value as effective treatments are currently unavailable for SCI.
