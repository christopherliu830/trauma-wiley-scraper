AB  - This paper reports on research into the effectiveness of strategic commanders and their multi-agency teams in response to major incidents. It is argued that current models of crisis leadership fail to establish a balance between the requirement for task skills, interpersonal skills, stakeholder awareness and personal qualities of commanders and their teams. The paper sets out a theoretical model for interwoven leadership combining these features.

AB  - Abstract The United States (US) Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Mid-Atlantic Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center (MIRECC) Post-Deployment Mental Health (PDMH) multi-site study examines post-deployment mental health in US military Afghanistan/Iraq-era veterans. The study includes the comprehensive behavioral health characterization of over 3600 study participants and the genetic, metabolomic, neurocognitive, and neuroimaging data for many of the participants. The study design also incorporates an infrastructure for a data repository to re-contact participants for follow-up studies. The overwhelming majority (94%) of participants consented to be re-contacted for future studies, and our recently completed feasibility study indicates that 73?83% of these participants could be reached successfully for enrollment into longitudinal follow-up investigations. Longitudinal concurrent cohort follow-up studies will be conducted (5?10+ years post-baseline) to examine predictors of illness chronicity, resilience, recovery, functional outcome, and other variables, and will include neuroimaging, genetic/epigenetic, serum biomarker, and neurocognitive studies, among others. To date, the PDMH study has generated more than 35 publications from the baseline data and the repository has been leveraged in over 20 publications from follow-up studies drawing from this cohort. Limitations that may affect data collection for a longitudinal follow-up study are also presented.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To compare the pharmacodynamics of once daily and twice daily administration of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) administration in horses. Study Design Randomized cross over study. Animals Adult mixed breed healthy mares (n?=?6). Methods LMWH (dalteparin) was administered (50?U/kg subcutaneously) either every 12 or 24?hours for 3 consecutive days. Anti-factor Xa activity was measured before and at select time points after LMWH administration. Packed cell volume (PCV), platelet count, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and anti-thrombin (AT) activity were monitored throughout the study. Results No changes in PCV, platelet count, or AT activity were detected with either frequency of daily LMWH administration. Values for PTT increased throughout the study but never exceeded the normal reference interval. Anti-factor Xa activity was maintained within or above the suggested thromboprophylactic range (0.1?0.2?U/mL) when LMWH was administered twice daily, but fell below this range ?16?hours after administration when given once daily. For both once and twice daily LMWH administration, the area under the curve was significantly greater after the last dose of LMWH when compared to the first dose. Conclusions Administration of LMWH once or twice daily for 3 consecutive days appears to be safe in healthy adult horses. Anti-factor Xa activity was maintained within or above the suggested thromboprophylactic range for 24?hours with twice daily LMWH administration but not with once daily administration.

AB  - Witnessed violence has significant negative consequences for youth behavior and mental health. However, many findings on the impact of witnessed violence have been based on a single informant. There is a general lack of consistency between caregiver and youth reports on both witnessed violence and behavioral problems. This study included data from both caregivers and youth and incorporated a multisource analytic approach to simultaneously examine the association between youth witnessed violence and externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. Data from 875 caregivers and 812 youth were collected as part of the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN). Findings showed that youth reported more witnessed violence than did their caregivers, and caregivers reported more externalizing and internalizing behavior problems than did youth. Further, the source of information had a significant impact on the association between witnessed violence and internalizing behaviors. These findings highlight the need to incorporate multiple sources and multi-informant analytic techniques to eliminate methodological limitations to understanding the effect of witnessed violence on youth behavioral problems.

AB  - Aim: To assess the causes and the prevalence of traumatic injuries to the permanent incisors of 12-year-old schoolchildren in Jaragua do Sul, Brazil. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Public and private primary schools. Participants: 476 children of both sexes, selected by multistage sampling technique. Methods: Clinical examination of upper and lower permanent incisors. Main outcome measures: Incisal overjet, lip coverage, traumatised anterior teeth, cause of trauma. Parents' levels of education and employment status and family income. Results: Boys experienced double the percentage of injuries compared to girls. Children with incisal overjet greater than 5mm (P = 0.077) and inadequate lip coverage (P = 0.667) were not more likely to have experienced dental injuries. The main causes of injuries to the permanent incisors were falls (26 per cent), traffic accidents (20.5 per cent), sports (19.2 per cent), violence (16.4 per cent) and collisions with people or inanimate objects (6.8 per cent). Socio-economic measures had no significant effect on prevalence of trauma. Conclusions: Policy makers must take the causes of trauma into account when developing a strategy for the prevention of dental injuries. The role of violence in causing traumatic dental injuries has been underestimated.

AB  - Objectives Studies in children of patients affected with bipolar disorder (BD; bipolar offspring) are at high risk to develop mood disorders. Our aim is to investigate how environmental factors such as childhood trauma and family functioning relate to the development of mood disorders in offspring at familial risk for BD. Design The current study is part of a longitudinal prospective cohort study among offspring of parents with BD. Methods The current study is part of the Dutch Bipolar Offspring Study, an ongoing prospective cohort study among adolescent offspring of a parent with BD. Bipolar offspring were psychiatrically evaluated at baseline and at 1-, 5-, and 12-year follow-up. Complete follow-up data over de 12-year follow-up were available for 102 offspring. Childhood trauma was measured with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and filled out by the offspring. Family functioning was reported by the mother with the 130-item Questionnaire for Family Problems (QFP). Results Emotional maltreatment was significantly associated (HR = 1.82, CI 1.18?2.82, p = .007) with mood disorder onset in bipolar offspring. No association was found with the family functioning total score (HR = 1.04, CI 0.94?15, p = .085) nor its subscales. Conclusions The current study suggests that emotional maltreatment is associated with mood disorder development in bipolar offspring. Remarkably, the association of offspring-reported emotional maltreatment and mood disorder onset was not reflected in parent-reported family functioning (e.g., support and communication, openness or involvement). Possible explanations are discussed and warrant further study. Practitioner points Offspring of bipolar patients are at increased risk of developing mood disorders across the life-time. Emotional trauma contributes to the likelihood of developing mood disorders in bipolar offspring. In the daily treatment of bipolar patients having children, attention should be given to parental style and difficulties. Further research using multiple informant methods on childhood trauma an family functioning is needed to further disentangle the effects of these variables on the onset of psychopathology in bipolar offspring.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To describe case mix variation among institutions, and report adverse event rates in congenital cardiac catheterization by case type. Background: Reported adverse event rates for patients with congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac catheterization vary considerably, due to non-comparable standards of data inclusion, and highly variable case mix. Methods: The Congenital Cardiac Catheterization Outcomes Project (C3PO) has been capturing case characteristics and adverse events (AE) for all cardiac catheterizations performed at six pediatric institutions. Validity and completeness of data were independently audited. Results: Between 2/1/07 and 4/30/08, 3855 cases (670 biopsy, 1037 diagnostic, and 2148 interventional) were recorded, median number of cases per site 480 (308 to 1526). General anesthesia was used in 70% of cases (28 to 99%), and 22% of cases (15 to 26%) were non-electively or emergently performed. Three institutions performed a higher proportion of interventions during a case, 72 to 77% compared to 56 to 58%. The median rate of AE reported per institution was 16%, ranging from 5 to 18%. For interventional cases the median rate of AE reported per institution was 19% (7 to 25%) compared to 10% for diagnostic cases (6 to 16%). The incidence of AE was significantly higher for interventional compared to diagnostic cases (20% vs 10%, p<0.001), as was the incidence of higher severity AE (9% vs 5%, p<0.001). Adverse events in biopsy cases were uncommon. Conclusions: In this multi-institutional cohort, the incidence of AE is higher among interventional compared to diagnostic cases, and is very low among biopsy cases. Equitable comparisons among institutions will require the development and application of risk adjustment methods.

AB  - Background Members of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex cause severe outbreaks in humans, and are increasingly reported in animals. Objective and Methods A retrospective study, describing a severe outbreak in dogs and cats caused by a multidrug resistant member of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex in a veterinary hospital, between July 2010 and November 2012. Results The study included 19 dogs and 4 cats. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex bacteria were isolated from urine (9 animals), respiratory tract (11), tissues (3) and blood (1). The most common infection-associated findings included fever, purulent discharge from endotracheal tubes, hypotension, and neutropaenia. Infections led to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis and sepsis. Infection was transmitted in the intensive care unit, where 22 of 23 animals were initially hospitalised. The mortality rate was 70% (16 of 23 animals), and was higher in cases of respiratory infection compared to other infections. Aggressive environmental cleaning and disinfection, with staff education for personal hygiene and antisepsis, sharply decreased the infection incidence. Clinical Significance Health care-associated outbreaks with multidrug resistant Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex in dogs and cats are potentially highly fatal and difficult to eradicate, warranting monitoring, antiseptic techniques and judicious antibiotic use.

AB  - Entheses are regions where tendons and ligaments attach to bone, and are the primary target in seronegative and other diseases of the musculoskeletal (MSK) system. MRI has been widely used for visualizing features of inflammatory and degenerative MSK disease; however, normal tendons and entheses have short transverse relaxation times (T2), and show little or no signal with conventional clinical MRI pulse sequences, making it difficult to investigate their MR properties. In this study we examined the normal MR morphology of the cadaveric Achilles tendon and enthesis at 3 T using novel three-dimensional ultrashort echo time (3D UTE) Cones sequences, and at 11.7 T using conventional MRI sequences. We also studied the MR properties of the Achilles tendon and enthesis including T2*, T1, and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR). In addition, MT modeling of macromolecular proton fractions was investigated using 3D UTE Cones sequences at 3 T. Indentation testing was performed to investigate the mechanical properties of the tendons and entheses, and this was followed by histological examination. In total five specimens (<50 years) were investigated. On average, tendons and entheses respectively had T2* values of 0.93 ± 0.48 ms and 2.77 ± 0.79 ms, T1 values of 644 ± 22 ms and 780 ± 55 ms, MTRs of 0.373 ± 0.03 and 0.244 ± 0.009 with an MT power of 1000° and frequency offset of 2 kHz, and macromolecular proton fractions of 18.0 ± 2.2% and 13.9 ± 1.9%. Compared with the tendon, the enthesis generally had a longer T2*, a longer T1, a lower MTR, and a lower macromolecular proton fraction as well as both a higher Young's modulus and stiffness. Results from this study are likely to provide a useful baseline for identifying deviations from the normal in seronegative arthritis and other disease of the entheses.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of Polyheal compared with surgery in treating chronic wounds with exposed bones and/or tendons (EB&T) due to trauma in France, Germany and the UK, from the perspective of the payers. Decision models were constructed depicting the management of chronic wounds with EB&T and spanned the period up to healing or up to 1 year. The models considered the decision by a plastic surgeon to treat these wounds with Polyheal or surgery and was used to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of Polyheal at 2010/2011 prices. Using Polyheal instead of surgery is expected to increase the probability of healing from 0·93 to 0·98 and lead to a total health-care cost of ?7984, ?7517 and ?8860 per patient in France, Germany and the UK, respectively. Management with surgery is expected to lead to a total health-care cost of ?12 300, ?18 137 and ?11 330 per patient in France, Germany and the UK, respectively. Hence, initial treatment with Polyheal instead of surgery is expected to lead to a 5% improvement in the probability of healing and a substantial decrease in health-care costs of 35%, 59% and 22% in France, Germany and the UK, respectively. Within the models' limitations, Polyheal potentially affords the public health-care system in France, Germany and the UK a cost-effective treatment for chronic wounds with EB&T due to trauma, when compared with surgery. However, this will be dependent on Polyheal's healing rate in clinical practice when it becomes routinely available.

AB  - Summary Sustainable, wide-reaching agricultural technology testing and transfer (TT&T) networks are usually beyond the implementation capacity of international and national agencies. Local, national and international non-governmental organizations (NGO) are one means to bridge the gap between funding agencies and rural households. This chapter reviews the role of development NGO in TT&T aimed at rural households. It looks at Mozambique's Zambezia Province and the approach one NGO has used in TT&T using donor funds. The chapter also looks at both the present as well as the future potential of the NGO as Mozambique's rural households seek to improve their economic security. The NGO have proven themselves capable of donor-funded, rural and agricultural TT&T where private sector, national and international research and extension agencies were unable to improve small farmer household income.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Common peroneal nerve (CPN) injury occurs in 10?40% of patients following knee dislocation. Is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using routine knee protocols able to adequately evaluate CPN injury and predict long-term outcome? Methods Trauma patients presenting for knee MRI at a single public hospital, between July 2007 and May 2017, were retrospectively identified using radiology and orthopaedic databases. Medical records were retrieved for clinical scores. MRI images were scored by two independent radiologists blinded to the clinical CPN status and scores correlated with initial clinical scores using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results Final cohort included 107 patients (81 males and 26 females) with a mean age of 39 (range 19?81 years). MRI was considered to be adequate for coverage of the CPN in 84 patients. Fourteen patients had CPN injury clinically (seven complete and seven partial). Concordance between MRI scores and initial clinical scores was 0.456 (P = 0.01). MRI sensitivity and specificity for CPN injury on the 84 adequate scans were 54.5% and 93.2% respectively. All seven cases of partial CPN injury and three of seven cases of complete CPN injury recovered fully. High MRI scores of 5 and 8 were given for the two patients with a persisting complete CPN palsy. Highest scores for partial CPN injury subjects were 2 and 4. Conclusions Magnetic resonance imaging using a routine knee protocol is not adequate for the assessment of CPN injury in many subjects. More specific MRI neural sequences with complete CPN coverage may be worth trialing.

AB  - Abstract Objective To test the efficacy of a piezoelectric instrument (PI) for bone removal during ventral slot surgery. Study Design Ex vivo feasibility study. Sample Population Cadaveric canine cervical spinal specimens (n?=?3; C1?7; C1?T1; C2?T1). Methods The spinal cord of each explanted spinal unit was replaced with a saline-filled latex condom. In 8 disc spaces, ventral slot surgery was performed using a previously reported technique. Bone removal was achieved using a motorized burr (MB). In 8 disc spaces, bone was removed via en bloc ostectomy with a PI that selectively cuts mineralized tissue. Surgical duration and operating field visibility were recorded. Rupture of the fluid filled condom was used as a measure of iatrogenic collateral trauma. Computed tomography was used to measure ventral slot morphometry. Results Mean surgical duration for PI (23.4?minutes) was significantly shorter than for MB (34.1?minutes; P?=?.049). Using a 4 point Likert scale (4?=?excellent, 3?=?good, 2?=?fair, 1?=?poor), median visibility score was significantly higher for PI (2) than for MB (1; P?=?.03). The condom burst twice (1MB, 1PI) during elevation of the dorsal longitudinal ligament; there was no significant difference between techniques for incidence of collateral trauma (P?=?.99). Regardless of surgical technique, there was a bias in slot deviation towards the right (i.e., the surgeon's left; P?=?.021). Conclusions The PI allowed completion of ventral slots in a significantly shorter time, without an increased incidence of iatrogenic trauma. The right-handed surgeon showed a left-sided aiming bias, regardless of surgical technique.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is arguably the most common psychiatric disorder to arise after exposure to a traumatic event. Since its formal introduction in the DSM-III in 1980, knowledge has grown significantly regarding its causes, maintaining mechanisms and treatments. Despite this increased understanding, however, the actual definition of the disorder remains controversial. The DSM-5 and ICD-11 define the disorder differently, reflecting disagreements in the field about whether the construct of PTSD should encompass a broad array of psychological manifestations that arise after trauma or should be focused more specifically on trauma memory phenomena. This controversy over clarifying the phenotype of PTSD has limited the capacity to identify biomarkers and specific mechanisms of traumatic stress. This review provides an up-to-date outline of the current definitions of PTSD, its known prevalence and risk factors, the main models to explain the disorder, and evidence-supported treatments. A major conclusion is that, although trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy is the best-validated treatment for PTSD, it has stagnated over recent decades, and only two-thirds of PTSD patients respond adequately to this intervention. Moreover, most people with PTSD do not access evidence-based treatment, and this situation is much worse in low- and middle-income countries. Identifying processes that can overcome these major barriers to better management of people with PTSD remains an outstanding challenge.

AB  - Depression is the most common mental disorder for young people, and it is associated with educational underachievement, self-harm, and suicidality. Current psychological therapies for adolescent depression are usually focused only on individual-level change and often neglect family or contextual influences. The efficacy of interventions may be enhanced with a broader therapeutic focus on family factors such as communication, conflict, support, and cohesion. This article describes a structured multi-family group approach to the treatment of adolescent depression: Behaviour Exchange Systems Therapy for adolescent depression (BEST MOOD). BEST MOOD is a manualized intervention that is designed to address both individual and family factors in the treatment of adolescent depression. BEST MOOD adopts a family systems approach that also incorporates psychoeducation and elements of attachment theories. The program consists of eight multifamily group therapy sessions delivered over 2 hours per week, where parents attend the first four sessions and young people and siblings join from week 5. The program design is specifically aimed to engage youth who are initially resistant to treatment and to optimize youth and family mental health outcomes. This article presents an overview of the theoretical model, session content, and evaluations to date, and provides a case study to illustrate the approach.

AB  - Objectives To compare the progression-free survival of dogs with high-grade T-cell lymphoma treated with either a cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone-based or a modified mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine chemotherapy protocol. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, cases were selected based on histologic or cytologic diagnosis of lymphoma, T-cell phenotype, hypercalcaemia, or both, and no previous chemotherapy for lymphoma. Treatment was not randomly allocated. Results Seventy-three dogs were included in this study: 50 in the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone group and 23 in the mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine group. The median progression-free survival was 133?days for dogs in the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone group and 97?days for dogs in the mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine group. When golden retrievers (n?=?16) were evaluated ?separately, progression-free survival was longer in the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone versus mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine treatment group (median PFS 154?days versus 70.5 days, respectively). Clinical Significance The progression-free survival time for dogs with multi-centric T-cell lymphoma treated with a modified mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine protocol was similar to that of dogs treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone. Further studies, including those evaluating golden retrievers separately, are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - Background:? Negative trauma-related cognitions have been found to be a significant factor in the maintenance of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults. Initial studies of such appraisals in trauma-exposed children and adolescents suggest that this is an important line of research in youth, yet empirically validated measures for use with younger populations are lacking. A measure of negative trauma-related cognitions for use with children and adolescents, the Child Post-Traumatic Cognitions Inventory (CPTCI), is presented. The measure was devised as an age-appropriate version of the adult Post-Traumatic Cognitions Inventory (Foa et al., 1999). Methods:? The CPTCI was developed and validated within a large (n?=?570) sample, comprising community and trauma-exposed samples of children and adolescents aged 6?18?years. Results:? Principal components analysis suggested a two-component structure. These components were labelled ?permanent and disturbing change? and ?fragile person in a scary world?, and were each found to possess good internal consistency, test?retest reliability, convergent validity, and discriminative validity. The reliability and validity of these sub-scales was present regardless of whether the measure was completed in the acute phase or several months after a trauma. Scores on these sub-scales did not vary with age. Conclusions:? The CPTCI is a reliable and valid measure that is not specific to the type of trauma exposure, and shows considerable promise as a research and clinical tool. The structure of this measure suggests that appraisals concerning the more abstract consequences of a trauma, as well as physical threat and vulnerability, are pertinent factors in trauma-exposed children and adolescents, even prepubescent children.

AB  - Summary Analysis of the bone marrow remains a basic tool in the evaluation of patients with hematopoeitic disorders. This chapter reviews the marrow biopsy procedure and the normal morphologic features of the marrow as well as outlining practical features in the evaluation the marrow aspirate smear and core biopsy. Ancillary diagnostic tests such as flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and cytogenetic studies important for defining the nature of marrow disorders are also discussed. The chapter should give the student a fundamental understanding of the bone marrow biopsy procedure and testing methods.

AB  - A sample of 313 Australian psychologists responded to a survey about their use of brief intelligence tests. Among those administering intelligence tests, approximately one in four used shortened versions of longer scales and just under half used a published test specifically constructed to provide quick information about intellectual functioning. Wechsler subtest short forms were the most frequent abbreviation while the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (Dunn & Dunn, 1981, 1997) and the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (Kaufman & Kaufman, 1990) were the most often used quick tests. The major reasons that psychologists used brief procedures was to save time, to obtain a global estimate of intelligence, to screen clients and to accommodate client characteristics that made full assessment difficult. Other aspects of brief intelligence testing are reported along with implications for training, practice and research.
