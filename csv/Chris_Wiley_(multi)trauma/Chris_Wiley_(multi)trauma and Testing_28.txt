AB  - ObjectiveTo investigate whether poor preoperative cardiopulmonary reserve and comorbid state dictate high-risk status and can predict complications in patients undergoing radical cystectomy (RC). Patients and Methods In all, 105 consecutive patients with transitional cell carcinoma (TCC; stage T1?T3) undergoing robot-assisted (38 patients) or open (67) RC in a single UK centre underwent preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). Prospective primary outcome variables were all-cause complications and postoperative length of stay (LOS). Binary logistic regression analysis identified potential predictive factor(s) and the predictive accuracy of CPET for all-cause complications was examined using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Correlations analysis employed Spearman's rank correlation and group comparison, the Mann?Whitney U-test and Fisher's exact test. Any relationships were confirmed using the Mantel?Haenszel common odds ratio estimate, Kaplan?Meier analysis and the chi-squared test. Results The anaerobic threshold (AT) was negatively (r = ?206, P = 0.035), and the ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide (VE/VCO2) positively (r = 0.324, P = 0.001) correlated with complications and LOS. Logistic regression analysis identified low AT (<11?mL/kg/min), high VE/VC02 (≥33) and hypertension as significant factors, such that, in their presence patients were 5.55-times more likely to have complications at 90 days postoperatively [P = 0.001, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2?13.9]. ROC analysis showed a high significance (area under the curve 0.78, 95% CI 0.69?0.87; P < 0.001). In addition, based on CPET criteria >50% of patients presenting for RC had significant heart failure, whereas preoperatively only very few (2%) had this diagnosis. Analysis using the Mann?Whitney test showed that a VE/VCO2 ≥33 was the most significant determinant of LOS (P = 0.004). Kaplan?Meier analysis showed that patients in this group had an additional median LOS of 4 days (P = 0.008). Finally, patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists grade of 3 (ASA 3) and those on long-term ?-blocker therapy were found to be at particular risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and death after RC with odds ratios of 4.0 (95% CI 1.05?15.2; P = 0.042) and 6.3 (95% CI 1.60?24.8; P = 0.008). Conclusion Patients with poor cardiopulmonary reserve and hypertension are at higher risk of postoperative complications and have increased LOS after RC. Heart failure is known to be a significant determinant of perioperative death and is significantly under diagnosed in this patient group.

AB  - SUMMARY The aim of this article was to review recent developments in the resuscitation of both trauma and non-trauma patients in haemorrhagic shock. Strategies for the resuscitation of massively haemorrhaging patients and the use of massive transfusion protocols (MTPs) have been a major focus of the trauma literature over the past several years. The application of haemostatic resuscitation practices and MTPs to non-trauma populations has long been in practice, but has only recently been the subject of active research. Medline and PubMed were reviewed for ?massive transfusion? (MT) from 2012 to present. Non-English and paediatric articles were excluded. Articles were systematically reviewed for their relevance to MT. There were eight major areas of development identified. In recent MT literature, there was an increased focus on massively haemorrhaging non-trauma patients, the role of acute traumatic coagulopathy, the use of thromboelastography (TEG), and the impact of MTPs on blood product waste and efficiency of product delivery. Other developments included additional MT prediction tools and The PRospective Observational Multicenter Major Trauma Transfusion (PROMMTT) study. There was also interest in re-evaluating the clinical relevance of the current MT definition and identifying new foci for MT. These recent developments reflect efforts to better understand and manage non-traumatic haemorrhage and to address prior limitations in the trauma literature. Inevitably, new questions have been raised, which will likely direct ongoing and future research in MT.

AB  - Abstract Researchers recognize that the connection between alcohol and peer violence may relate to community level ecological factors, such as the location of businesses that sell alcohol. Building on previous research among adults, this study examines the relationship between alcohol outlet density and violent behaviors among adolescents, taking into account demographic characteristics, individual alcohol use, and neighborhood level socioeconomic indicators. Data drawn from a diverse Emergency Department based sample of 1,050 urban adolescents, combined with tract level data from the state liquor control commission and U.S. Census, were analyzed. Results of multivariate multi-level regression analysis indicate that alcohol outlet density is significantly related to adolescents' violent behaviors, controlling for demographic characteristics and individual alcohol use. Census tract level socioeconomic indicators were not significantly associated with youth violence. Findings suggest that alcohol outlet density regulation should be considered as part of broader violence prevention strategies for urban adolescents.

AB  - Abstract Objective This study aims to describe the association between sociodemographic factors and trajectories of disease, disability and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in early rheumatoid arthritis (ERA). Methods Data were collected prospectively over 3 years in the Singapore Early Arthritis Cohort study. Trajectories were modeled using multi-trajectory group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) and determinants of trajectory membership were identified using multinomial logistic regression. Results Two hundred and thirteen patients were included: 58.2% Chinese, 16.4% Malay, 21.6% Indian, mean (SD) age 51.3 (12.6) years and symptom duration 21.8 (15.3) weeks. In the multi-trajectory analysis, three groups of disease trajectories and corresponding disability and HRQoL trajectories were identified: group 1 (moderate disease rapid response, 49.9%), group 2 (high disease rapid response, 31.1%) and group 3 (high disease slow response, 19.1%). Malay patients had higher relative risk ratio (RRR) of being in trajectory groups 2 and 3 compared to group 1 (RRR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.05-3.98 and RRR = 4.02, 95% CI 1.45-6.43, respectively) while patients with tertiary education had lower relative risk (RRR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.45-0.89 and RRR = 0.33, (95% CI 0.14-0.83, respectively). In the analysis of individual outcomes, ethnicity, education level and body mass index were determinants of the heterogeneous disease activity trajectories. Gender and education level were determinants of the disability trajectories. Only gender was a determinant of the HRQoL trajectories. Further, 96.2% of the patients were treated with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Conclusion Disparities in sociodemographic factors should be taken into consideration in formulating treatment strategies in ERA.

AB  - Background Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cells, originally identified in bone-marrow. Little is known about MSCs of the head and neck region. We investigated cell biological properties with a potential impact on wound healing of 2 different tissue-resident MSC populations. Methods MSCs were isolated from human nasal mucosa (nmMSCs) and parotid gland (pgMSCs). Clonogenic potential, cell surface markers, cytokine secretion, chemokine receptor expression, mobility, and adhesion to extracellular matrix were examined in unstimulated and stimulated MSCs. Results NmMSCs had the higher clonogenic potential. PgMSCs showed a broader panel of chemokine receptor expression and displayed higher mobility, especially after challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). NmMSCs were less mobile and showed increased LPS-induced secretion of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) compared with pgMSCs. Conclusion These data highlight functional differences between tissue-resident MSCs of the head and neck region, which may impact functional properties of these cells in response to trauma or infection. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary The cervical spine is approached in two separate anatomic and functional regions: the craniocervical junction (occiput, C1 and C2) and the subaxial spine (C3 to C7). Injury to the craniocervical junction or cervical spine trauma is usually indirect, related to forces transmitted through the head. Current recommendations for initial imaging in adults with suspected cervical spine injury is a thin slice CT of the cervical spine. The most common fracture of C1 is a bilateral vertical fracture through the neural arch. Fractures of C2 may occur in isolation or in association with additional cervical spine fractures. The most common fracture of C2 involves the odontoid, followed by Hangman's fracture, anteroinferior endplate (hyperextension teardrop) and least commonly, isolated C2 body or posterior element fractures. A burst fracture commonly results from combined axial loading and flexion vector in C5, C6, and C7 locations. Compression fractures are common in elderly patients with osteoporosis.

AB  - Abstract Through the application of the Delphi technique, this study draws on the expertise of British child protection academics and practitioners from a wide range of disciplines in seeking to develop a consensus opinion on possible early indicators of child abuse and neglect. The search for early indicators is described in the context of a secondary preventative approach to the problem of child maltreatment. A very tentative conclusion arising from the study is that the early indicators of child abuse and neglect that achieved consensus of agreement may help in diagnosing child abuse and neglect at an earlier stage, although they are not necessarily diagnostic. Alternative explanations, differential diagnoses and information-gathering are paramount, as is a willingness and ability to act on concerns. Although great caution is urged, it is suggested that the findings from the study are credible and of interest to those who are working towards more timely recognition and referral of abused and neglected children.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To generate a high-resolution atlas of the hippocampal subfields using images acquired from 7 T, multi-echo, gradient-echo MRI for the evaluation of epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders as well as investigating (apparent transverse relaxation rate) and quantitative volume magnetic susceptibility (QS) of the subfields. Experimental Design: Healthy control subjects (n?=?17) were scanned at 7 T using a multi-echo gradient-echo sequence and susceptibility-weighted magnitude images, and QS maps were reconstructed. We defined a hippocampal subfield labeling protocol for the magnitude image produced from the average of all echoes and assessed reproducibility through volume and shape metrics. A group-wise diffeomorphic registration procedure was used to generate an average atlas of the subfields for the whole subject cohort. The quantitative MRI maps and subfield labels were then warped to the average atlas space and used to measure mean values of and QS characterizing each subfield. Principal Observations: We were able to reliably label hippocampal subfields on the multi-echo susceptibility images. The group-averaged atlas accurately aligns these structures to produce a high-resolution depiction of the subfields, allowing assessment of both quantitative susceptibility and across subjects. Our analysis of variance demonstrates that there are more apparent differences between the subfields on these quantitative maps than the normalized magnitude images. Conclusion: We constructed a high-resolution atlas of the hippocampal subfields for use in voxel-based studies and demonstrated in vivo quantification of susceptibility and in the subfields. This work is the first in vivo quantification of susceptibility values within the hippocampal subfields at 7 T. Hum Brain Mapp 35:3588?3601, 2014. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - During one year all ankle inversion injuries seen at the acute ward of our institution were divided into grades of severity and classified according to the maximal area of tenderness at the time of clinical examination. Seven years later 648 of the subjects (91%) evaluated their ankle with the help of a questionnaire. Location of maximal tenderness at the time of injury was: lateral fibular ligaments 61%, lateral midfoot ligaments 24%, base of the fifth metatarsal/peroneal tendons 5% and combined lesions 8%. 39% were considered minor, 46% were moderate, and 15% severe. All cases followed a functional treatment protocol. Seven years post- injury 32% reported chronic complaints of pain, swelling or recurrent sprains. 72% of the subjects with residual disability reported that they were functionally impaired by their ankle ? in most cases a question of not performing sports at a desired level. 4% experienced pain at rest and were severely disabled. 19% were bothered by repeated inversion injuries ? 43% of these subjects felt that they could compensate by using an external ankle support. There was no correlation between the severity of the sprain as judged at the time of injury and the frequency of residual disability or between the area of maximal tenderness at the time of injury and the area of maximal pain at the time of follow-up.

AB  - Abstract Alterations in cerebrovascular function are evident acutely in moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), although less is known about their chronic effects. Adolescent and adult patients with moderate to severe TBI have been reported to demonstrate diffuse activation throughout the brain during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Because fMRI is a measure related to blood flow, it is possible that any deficits in blood flow may alter activation. An arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion sequence was performed on seven adolescents with chronic moderate to severe TBI and seven typically developing (TD) adolescents during the same session in which they had performed a social cognition task during fMRI. In the TD group, prefrontal CBF was positively related to prefrontal activation and negatively related to non-prefrontal, posterior, brain activation. This relationship was not seen in the TBI group, who demonstrated a greater positive relationship between prefrontal CBF and non-prefrontal activation than the TD group. An analysis of CBF data independent of fMRI showed reduced CBF in the right non-prefrontal region (p < .055) in the TBI group. To understand any role reduced CBF may play in diffuse extra-activation, we then related the right non-prefrontal CBF to activation. CBF in the right non-prefrontal region in the TD group was positively associated with prefrontal activation, suggesting an interactive role of non-prefrontal and prefrontal blood flow throughout the right hemisphere in healthy brains. However, the TBI group demonstrated a positive association with activation constrained to the right non-prefrontal region. These data suggest a relationship between impaired non-prefrontal CBF and the presence of non-prefrontal extra-activation, where the region with more limited blood flow is associated with activation limited to that region. In a secondary analysis, pathology associated with hyperintensities on T2-weighted FLAIR imaging over the whole brain was related to whole brain activation, revealing a negative relationship between lesion volume and frontal activation, and a positive relationship between lesion volume and posterior activation. These preliminary data, albeit collected with small sample sizes, suggest that reduced non-prefrontal CBF, and possibly pathological tissue associated with T2-hyperintensities, may provide contributions to the diffuse, primarily posterior extra-activation observed in adolescents following moderate to severe TBI.

AB  - In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of multi-family therapy at reducing the addiction severity and at improving the psychological and family dynamics of opiate addicts receiving methadone treatment at a public treatment center. The study compares multi-family therapy with a reflecting team (MFT-RT) and a standard treatment following a methadone maintenance treatment program. The results show that multi-family therapy with a reflecting team effectively reduces the addiction severity in several of the areas evaluated and noted that this effect is superior to standard treatment. The psychotherapy patients showed improvement in the areas of employment and social support; their drug use diminished and their psychiatric condition improved. At the same time, they needed a lower daily dose of methadone. In addition, the group undergoing standard treatment showed a noteworthy deterioration in their medical condition. Both groups showed a significant increase in their alcohol use. When applied to family treatments, the systemic-constructivist approach by the reflecting team offers combined techniques that can help improve care for the families of patients with addiction problems.

AB  - Background:? The role of pre-hospital trauma care and the effect of pre-hospital rapid sequence intubation (RSI) on patient outcome are still not clear. This study evaluated the impact of pre-hospital trauma care by emergency physicians (EP) on mortality from severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and a 180-day Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Methods:? A 48-month parallel non-controlled cohort study compared a group of 64 patients with severe TBI [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) < 9; Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 15] who received pre-hospital advanced life support (ALS) with RSI and were transported to the hospital by EPs (EP group), with a group of 60 patients who did not receive pre-hospital ALS with RSI [emergency medical technicians (EMT) group]. Results:? There were no significant statistical differences between the groups in age (P= 0.79), mechanism of injury (P= 0.68), gender (P= 0.82), initial GCS (P= 0.63), initial SaO2 in the field (P= 0.63), initial systolic blood pressure in the field (P= 0.47) and on-scene time (P= 0.41). In the EP group, there was significantly better first hour survival (97% vs. 79%, P= 0.02), first day survival (90% vs. 72%, P= 0.02), better functional outcome (GOS 4?5: 53% vs. 33%, P < 0.01; GOS 2?3: 8% vs. 20%, P < 0.01) and shortened hospitalization time in intensive care unit (ICU) (P= 0.03) and other departments (P= 0.04). In total hospital mortality, we detected no differences between both groups [EP group: 40% (95% CI: 34?45%) vs. EMT group 42% (95% CI: 36?47%, P= 0.76], except in a subgroup of patients with GCS 6?8 where there was significantly lower total hospital mortality in the EP group (24% vs. 78%, P < 0.01). Conclusion:? After starting the trauma care system with emergency physicians in our region, there was a decrease in the number of deaths on hospital admission, a reduction in hospital mortality in the GCS group 6?8, a change in the temporal distribution of deaths, an improvement in functional neurological outcome and shortened hospitalization time.

However, the total mechanical joint work (WTotal), parameter best related to the vertical displacement of the body mass center during vertical jumping, has not yet been studied. The aim of this research was to compare asymmetries between ACL-R subjects and healthy matched subjects, through the analysis of the kinematics and kinetics during a single-leg squat jump. Asymmetries are defined by the Limb Symmetry Index (LSI). A greater LSI was observed for WTotal in the ACL-R group than in the healthy group. There was no difference in LSI for knee joint work between the two groups, while the LSI for hip and ankle joint work was significantly larger in the ACL-R group. This was explained by greater LSI for the hip and ankle joint range of motion in the ACL-R group than in the healthy group. After ACL-R, patients exhibited greater asymmetries than healthy subjects during single-leg squat jump. Physiotherapists should focus on quality execution of multi-joint movement, especially on hip and ankle joints range of motion in order to reduce asymmetries and to improve vertical jumping performance.

AB  - Jafarzadeh H, Abbott PV. Review of pulp sensibility tests. Part II: electric pulp tests and test cavities. International Endodontic Journal, 43, 945?958, 2010. Abstract The electric pulp test (EPT) is one type of pulp sensibility test that can be used as an aid in the diagnosis of the status of the dental pulp. However, like thermal pulp sensibility tests, it does not provide any direct information about the vitality (blood supply) of the pulp or whether the pulp is necrotic. The relevant literature on pulp sensibility tests in the context of endodontics up to January 2009 was reviewed using PubMed and MEDLINE database searches. This search identified articles published between November 1964 and January 2009 in all languages. The EPT is technique sensitive, and false responses may occur. Various factors can affect the test results, and therefore it is important that dental practitioners understand the nature of these tests and how to interpret them. Test cavities have been suggested as another method for assessing the pulp status; however, the use of this technique needs careful consideration because of its invasive and irreversible nature. In addition, it is unlikely to be useful in apprehensive patients and should not be required because it provides no further information beyond what thermal and electric pulp sensibility tests provide ? that is, whether the pulp is able to respond to a stimulus. A review of the literature and a discussion of the important points regarding these two tests are presented.

AB  - Neuropsychological evaluation of persons with chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI) symptoms is complicated by multiple factors. The authors explored the impact of mechanism of injury, effort testing performance, and neuropsychiatric status in a sample of military veterans (V-TBI) and civilians (C-TBI) with chronic TBI. V-TBI (n?=?74), C-TBI (n?=?67), and healthy civilian control (C-HC) participants (n?=?66), completed a battery of neuropsychological, effort, and self-report neuropsychiatric measures. Results indicated that C-HC and C-TBI participants exhibited comparably low failure rates on effort tests (6% and 3%, respectively). V-TBI participants exhibited significantly higher rates of failure (18%). Subgroups (n?=?20) of effort-screened participants matched for demographics and disability level were compared regarding neuropsychological performance and neuropsychiatric self-report. Both TBI groups exhibited limited neuropsychological impairment, relative to the C-HC participants. The V-TBI group exhibited pronounced neuropsychiatric symptomology compared with the other participant groups. The implications of these findings are discussed for evaluation in the context of disability and litigation. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) presents in young, otherwise-healthy individuals. This study examined recurrence and survival characteristics after surgical resection for FLC by utilizing an international multi-institutional database. Methods Consecutive patients undergoing hepatectomy for FLC from six institutions (1993?2010) were reviewed retrospectively. Survival was studied with life tables and Cox regression models. Results Thirty-five patients (13 female, 37%) were included (median age: 32 years). R0 resection was achieved in all curative-intent operations (n?=?30), and palliative operations were performed for five patients. Crude 30-day morbidity and mortality rates were 22% and 3%, respectively. For curative-intent surgery, overall and recurrence-free survivals at 5 years were 62% and 45%, respectively. In patients who achieved a 4-year disease-free interval after surgery, none subsequently developed recurrence. In multivariate models, presence of extrahepatic disease was the only factor that independently predicted overall (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.58, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38?22.55, P?=?0.016) and recurrence-free survival (HR: 5.64, 95% CI: 1.48?21.49, P?=?0.011). Conclusions Patients with surgically amenable FLC had encouraging long-term survival. Recurrence-free survival to 4 years suggested possible freedom from disease thereafter. Recurrent resectable disease was associated with an excellent prognosis, and repeat surgery should be strongly considered. J. Surg. Oncol. 2014; 110:412?415. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objective To describe contemporary outcomes of balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAVP) performed in 22 US centers. Background: BAVP constitutes first-line therapy for congenital aortic stenosis (cAS) in many centers. Methods We used prospectively-collected data from two active, multi-institutional, pediatric cardiac catheterization registries. Acute procedural success was defined, for purposes of this review, as a residual peak systolic gradient?≤?35 mm Hg and no more than mild aortic regurgitation (AR) for patients with isolated cAS. For patients with mixed aortic valve disease, a residual peak systolic gradient?≤?35 mm Hg without worsening of AR was considered successful outcome. Results In 373 patients with a median age of 8 months (1 day to 40 years of age) peak systolic gradient had a median of 59 [50, 71] mm Hg pre-BAVP and 22 [15, 30] mm Hg post-BAVP (P?<?0.001). Procedural success was achieved in 160 patients (71%). The factors independently associated with procedural success were: first time intervention (OR?=?2.0 (1.0, 4.0) P?=?0.04), not-prostaglandin dependent, (OR=3.5 (1.5, 8.1); P?=?0.003), and isolated cAS (absence of AR) (OR?=?2.1 (1.1?3.9); P?=?0.03). Twenty percent of patients experienced adverse events, half of which were of high severity. There was no procedural mortality. Neonatal status was the only factor associated with increased risk of high severity adverse events (OR 3.7; 95% CI 1.5?9.0). Conclusion In the current era, BAVP results in procedural success (gradient reduction with minimal increase in AR) in 71% of patients treated at US centers where BAVP is considered first-line therapy relative to surgery. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
