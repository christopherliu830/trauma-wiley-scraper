AB  - Abstract Background Blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI) occurs in 0.2?2.7% of blunt trauma patients and has up to 30% mortality. Conventional screening does not recognize up to 20% of BCVI patients. To improve diagnosis of BCVI, both an expanded battery of screening criteria and a multi-detector computed tomography angiography (CTA) have been suggested. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the use of CTA restricted to the Denver protocol screen-positive patients would reduce the unnecessary use of CTA as a pre-emptive screening tool. Methods This is a registry-based study of blunt trauma patients admitted to Auckland City Hospital from 1998 to 2012. The diagnosis of BCVI was confirmed or excluded with CTA, magnetic resonance angiography and, if these imaging were non-conclusive, four-vessel digital subtraction angiography. Results Thirty (61%) BCVI and 19 (39%) non-BCVI patients met eligibility criteria. The Denver protocol applied to our cohort of patients had a sensitivity of 97% (95% confidence interval (CI): 83?100%) and a specificity of 42% (95% CI: 20?67%). With a prevalence of BCVI in blunt trauma patients of 0.2% and 2.7%, post-test odds of a screen-positive test were 0.03 (95% CI: 0.002?0.005) and 0.046 (95% CI: 0.314?0.068), respectively. Conclusions Application of the CTA to the Denver protocol screen-positive trauma patients can decrease the use of CTA as a pre-emptive screening tool by 95?97% and reduces its hazards.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the orthopedic and hand trauma. Pelvic binders reduce transfusion requirements, the length of hospital stay and mortality in patients with anteroposterior compression (APC) injuries. Although patients that sustain pelvic ring injuries complain of pelvic and low back pain, women have significant risk for pain with sexual intercourse. Women have a more than double rate of having a cesarean section after having a pelvic fracture. The rate of low back pain, posterior pelvic pain, and leg length discrepancy is not different from men. Wrist pain without acute radiographic findings occurs. Radial-sided wrist pain may indicate an occult scaphoid fracture. If there are no definitive radiographic findings, the best plan is to immobilize the wrist and repeat evaluation. If they still have radial-sided wrist pain, then referral to an orthopedic surgeon is appropriate.

AB  - Objectives This prospective study investigated whether within-individual relations between depression vulnerability factors (childhood trauma, dysfunctional attitudes, maladaptive coping) and depressive symptom trajectories varied as a function of the number of prior major depressive episodes (MDEs) experienced in their lifetime. Design Participants were 68 young adults who varied with regard to their history of depression; 32 were remitted depressed and 36 were never depressed. Methods Depressive symptoms and disorders were assessed using semi-structured psychiatric interviews conducted twice over a 6-month period; interviews yielded weekly ratings of depressive symptoms during the follow-up interval. Childhood trauma, dysfunctional attitudes and coping were assessed with self-report measures. Data analyses were conducted using time-lagged multilevel models. Results Individuals with more previous MDEs who reported greater childhood trauma exposure, more dysfunctional attitudes, or greater use of maladaptive coping strategies experienced more rapid increases in depressive symptoms during the follow-up period. A significant interaction of coping, number of previous MDEs, and time was found indicating that among individuals with less adaptive coping (i.e., lower primary or lower secondary control coping scores), depressive symptoms rating (DSR) increased significantly in relation to number of prior depressive episodes; no change in DSR was observed for never-depressed individuals. Among individuals with higher primary control coping scores, significant increases in DSR scores were observed for individuals with ≥3 prior MDEs only. Conclusions Findings highlight the need for treatment and prevention programmes that target stress reactivity and coping strategies early in the course of depression. Practitioner points Findings highlight the need to conduct multi-dimensional assessments of depression vulnerability that examine the interplay among risk factors over time. Relations between vulnerability factors (childhood trauma, dysfunctional attitudes, maladaptive coping) and depressive symptoms were stronger for individuals with more prior major depressive episodes (MDEs). Interventions for recurrent depression should focus on secondary control coping strategies that emphasize accommodation to stressful life events. Future studies should assess high-risk individuals before their first MDE to determine whether vulnerability factors linked with recurrence are pre-existing and relatively stable, or if they reflect ?scars? from MDEs.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides an overview of the pathology, epidemiology, prevention, identification and management of the most significant complications affecting the orthopaedic and trauma patient. These complications can be life threatening and lead to delays in recovery. They are often preventable and when they are not, early detection is vital so that interventions can be activated which minimise the consequences. The practitioner needs to understand how to prevent, recognise and manage complications ? both those which are general and relatively common and those which are relatively rare and related specifically to orthopaedic and trauma conditions and care. Some of the considerable evidence base which identifies best practice in risk management, detection and care are considered here so that the practitioner is provided with some guidance for practice in the most common complications: infection (including urinary and respiratory tract infections), compartment syndrome, fat embolism, venous thromboembolism, urinary retention, shock and constipation.

AB  - Severely injured patients are at a risk of acute traumatic coagulopathy contributing to high mortally rates. The early use of tranexamic acid in this setting has been shown to be safe and improves survival. Optimal FFP: Red cell ratios needed with respect to outcomes are yet to be defined. Slow turnaround times associated with the use of laboratory based coagulation testing can lead to delays in appropriate component support with a need for validated algorithms for near patient global tests of haemostasis. Multidisciplinary protocols are required for managing traumatic haemorrhage with emphasis on good communication supported by training, audit and on-going review of cases to optimise patient care.

AB  - Abstract Keloid scars are described as benign fibro-proliferative dermal outgrowths that commonly occur in pigmented skin post cutaneous injury, and continue to grow beyond the boundary of the original wound margin. There is a lack of thorough understanding of keloid pathogenesis and thus keloid therapeutic options remain ill-defined. In view of the poor response to current therapy and high recurrence rates, there is an unmet need in improving our knowledge and therefore in identifying targeted and effective treatment strategies in management of keloids. Keloid research however, is hampered by a lack of relevant animal models as keloids do not spontaneously occur in animals and are unique to human skin. Therefore, developing novel animal models and nonanimal models for functional evaluation of keloid cells and tissue for better understanding their pathobiology and response to putative candidate therapies are essential. Here, we present the key concepts and relevant emerging research on two-dimensional and three-dimensional cell and tissue models for functional testing of keloid scars. We will describe in detail current models including in vitro mono- and co-cultures, multi-cellular spheroids (organoids) and organotyopic cultures, ex vivo whole skin keloid tissue organ culture models as well as in vivo human patient models. Finally, we discuss the role played by time as the fourth dimension in a novel model that involves sequential temporal biopsies of human patients with keloids (a so called 4D in vivo human model). The use of these unique models will no doubt prove pivotal in identification of new drug targets as well as biomarkers, in functional testing of emerging novel therapeutics, and in enhancing our understanding of keloid disease biology.

AB  - Abstract Juvenile and family courts hold a unique position among the many stakeholders that comprise a healing community for persons experiencing adversity or trauma. Specifically, judges and other court leaders can promote the implementation of screening for trauma, the alignment of appropriate and effective treatment for trauma when indicated, and the accountability of systems for coordination and support of such services. To that end, the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges undertook a field-based project ? consisting of multiple semi-structured court surveys ? to elucidate the key features of a trauma-informed court and how to assist courts in becoming more trauma-responsive for both consumers and staff. With the assistance of courts in 11 pilot sites across the nation, the project has led to the development of a protocol called trauma consultation or trauma audit, which is outlined here. Our work in developing the consultation protocol highlighted the need to better understand (1) the prevalence and impact of secondary traumatic stress in court staff, (2) the potential for environment to contribute to traumatic stress reactions, and (3) the importance of consistent trauma screenings and subsequent use of findings. Practical suggestions for courts to become more trauma-informed are also provided.

AB  - Abstract:? Ten urine chemistry parameters were measured on 74 voided urine samples from 34 wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Multi-reagent urine dipstick tests were performed and results determined using colorimetric scales. Urine pH measured between 8 and 9 units in 91% of the chimpanzees. Test pads detected protein, erythrocytes, leukocyte esterase activity, and nitrites, ketones and bilirubin in 47, 32, 29, and <10% of the chimpanzees, respectively. No apparent association between positive test results for blood in adult females and reproductive status was found. Overall, 17 of the 34 chimpanzees had positive urine test results for protein, hemoglobin, erythrocytes, leukocytes, nitrites, ketones, and/or bilirubin. Dipstick urinalysis alone is an unreliable method for assessing health and physiological status of wild chimpanzees. However, if combined with other diagnostics it could prove to be a valuable health-monitoring tool. Limitations associated with this methodology need to be considered when interpreting urinary dipstick test results.

AB  - Summary Trauma is the leading cause of death in children. Genitourinary tract injuries are rare, accounting for <3% of trauma cases. The majority of these injuries are due to blunt trauma such as motor vehicle collisions. In developed countries, iatrogenic injuries are especially prominent in the neonatal period whilst school-age children are prone to sports-related injuries, kicks and straddle injuries. Recent literature regarding pediatric genital trauma has focused on identifying and treating sexual abuse injuries as well as distinguishing these injuries from accidental trauma. This chapter reviews common etiologies for traumatic genital injuries and evaluate current diagnostic and treatment options. Risk factors, presenting signs and the evaluation of sexual abuse will also be reviewed.

AB  - Abstract In poly-traumatic patients a blunt chest trauma is an important trigger of the posttraumatic systemic inflammatory response. There is clinical evidence that fracture healing is delayed in such patients, however, experimental data are lacking. Therefore, we investigated the influence of a thoracic trauma on fracture healing in a rat model. Male Wistar rats received either a blunt chest trauma combined with a femur osteotomy or an isolated osteotomy. A more rigid or a more flexible external fixator was used for fracture stabilization to analyze whether the thoracic trauma influences regular healing and mechanically induced delayed bone healing differently. The blunt chest trauma induced a significant increase of IL-6 serum levels after 6 and 24?h, suggesting the induction of a systemic inflammation, whereas the isolated fracture had no effect. Under a more rigid fixation the thoracic trauma considerably impaired fracture healing after 35 days, reflected by a significantly reduced flexural rigidity (three-point-bending test), as well as a significantly diminished callus volume, moment of inertia, and relative bone surface (µCT analysis). In confirming the clinical evidence, this study reports for the first time that a blunt chest trauma considerably impaired bone healing, possibly via the interaction of the induced systemic inflammation with local inflammatory processes. ? 2010 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Background Trauma remains the most frequent cause of death for patients under 35 years of age. Head injury and catastrophic haemorrhage account for the majority of early deaths. A trauma laparotomy is often necessary to arrest haemorrhage. Methods All patients who died in Queensland hospitals between 2011 and 2016 having had a trauma laparotomy were identified from the Queensland Audit of Surgical Mortality. Results About 69.0% of the 84 deaths were male with a median age of 47.6 years. About 64.3% of deaths occurred within the first 2 days following trauma. Mechanism of injury was typically road traffic accident (77.4%). Sixteen patients underwent a non-therapeutic laparotomy. Following peer-review, different management was recommended for only three patients. Conclusion This group of patients who died in the setting of a trauma laparotomy received high quality trauma care. Ongoing education is needed as some non-therapeutic laparotomies may be avoidable.

AB  - Abstract Background The pathway from acute trauma care to inpatient rehabilitation has not been previously studied in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. This study aimed to examine the outcomes of patients transferred from a trauma service to its ?in-house? rehabilitation service (Group A) compared with outcomes of patients transferred from a designated trauma centre to an external rehabilitation service (Group B). This is carried out to identify any inefficiencies, delays and opportunities for improvement. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study using linked registry data. This study included all patients admitted after a motor vehicle collision to trauma services in NSW over the period of 2009?2012, who required inpatient rehabilitation. Those requiring specialized brain or spinal injury rehabilitation or those who went to private rehabilitation units were excluded. Results There were 249 patients in this cohort with majority (59%) in Group A and the remainder in Group B. There was no significant difference between the age of the patients, injury severity or acute length of stay (LOS) between the two groups. Admission and discharge functional independence measure scores were also similar between the two groups. There was a significant difference in the LOS in rehabilitation (30 days for Group A compared with 40 days in Group B, P?=?0.02). Conclusions Transferring patients to an external rehabilitation service from a designated trauma service is less efficient than providing the same care by the ?in-house? rehabilitation service. There may be opportunities to improve the efficiency of trauma management and reduce costs.

AB  - Abstract Background/Purpose:? Non-operative management of blunt splenic trauma (BST) in children is the standard of care with a success rate of greater than 90%. This paper aims to determine the factors which could predict the need for operative intervention in children with BST. Methods:? Prospectively entered data of 69 children with BST, between 1997 and 2008, from a single tertiary level trauma centre, were retrospectively analysed. A radiologist blinded to the outcome reviewed all computed tomography scans retrospectively. Results:? Forty-two children had isolated BST (61%) and 27 children had associated injuries (39%). All except one survived the injury and non-operative treatment was successful in 91%. Six of the 69 children (9%) with BST underwent splenectomy. There was no independent correlation to age, gender, mechanism of injury (MOI), injury grade and the need for splenectomy, whereas haemodynamic instability within 6?h of injury defined as failed resuscitation had a 100% correlation. Conclusion:? Haemodynamic instability, which failed to respond to resuscitation within 6?h, predicted the need for splenectomy in children with BST. Splenic injury grade assessed by computed tomography scan does not predict the need for splenectomy.

AB  - SUMMARY Severe trauma can lead to a compromised immune response, thereby increasing susceptibility to infections. Here we will study to what extent these early changes in the immune status upon trauma affect a primary immune response to keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). Because glutamine is the preferred respiratory substrate for immune competent cells and known to be depleted after trauma, we studied the immune status and the primary sensitization in relation to the glutamine plasma concentration in a group of severe trauma patients [injury severity score (ISS) >17]. Trauma patients (n?=?31) were sensitized with KLH within 12 h after trauma; plasma glutamine concentrations and immune parameters were determined, after which KLH-specific immune responsiveness was evaluated on days 9 and 14. Low plasma glutamine concentrations were found after trauma. Significantly elevated numbers of granulocytes and CD14-positive leucocytes were found, whereas the HLA-DR expression on CD14-positive cells was significantly lower in trauma patients than in healthy controls. Trauma did not change the in vitro proliferative capacity of lymphocytes when cultured with glutamine; however, when lymphocytes were cultured without glutamine, trauma resulted in lower proliferation than healthy controls. Phytohaemagglutinin-(PHA)-induced interferon (IFN)-? and interleukin (IL)-10 production was significantly lower after trauma, whereas IL-4 production was not affected. KLH sensitization following trauma resulted in poor skin test reactivity and low in vitro KLH-induced lymphocyte proliferation compared to controls. In contrast, the development of anti-KLH IgM, IgG, IgA, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 production on days 9 and 14 following trauma was not different from that in healthy controls. Major trauma was associated with a reduced cell-mediated immune response, correlating with low plasma glutamine concentrations, while no effects of trauma were found on the development of a primary humoral immune response.

AB  - Summary Comorbidity of trauma and PTSD with addictive disorders is common in adolescents. The interrelationship between the two conditions is complex with addictive behaviors following the trauma, as well as preceding it. While there are established treatments for each of the conditions separately, few treatments addressing the comorbidity have been developed and tested. Little is known about the impact of the comorbid addictive disorders and trauma-related disorders on the adolescent developmental trajectory, the ability of the adolescents to acquire crucial psychosocial skills in the face of these twin disorders. In view of the adolescent tendency not to self-disclose, pro-active screening for trauma in the population of addicted adolescents, as well as screening for substance abuse in those who had experienced trauma, is highly indicated.

AB  - Objective To review the literature and make practical recommendations regarding the conservative management of renal trauma. Patients and Methods Relevant articles and guidelines published between 1980 and 2014 were reviewed. Graded recommendations were constructed by a multi-disciplinary panel consisting of urologists, radiologists, and infectious disease physicians. These recommendations underwent formal review and debate at the Western Australian USANZ 2013 state conference, and were presented at the USANZ 2014 annual scientific meeting. Results The literature on the conservative management of renal trauma is reviewed within the framework of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) kidney injury severity scale. Graded recommendations are made regarding several key topics including: imaging, inpatient management, antibiotics, return to activity, and follow-up. Grade IV injuries and intraoperative consults are examined separately in view of the difficulties these groups cause in making appropriate treatment decisions. Conclusion A practical clinical guideline is provided regarding the conservative management of renal trauma.

AB  - Abstract Trauma to the permanent teeth involves not only the teeth but also the pulp, the periodontal ligament, alveolar bone, gingiva and other associated structures. There are many variations in the types of injuries with varying severity and often a tooth may sustain more than one injury at the same time. In more severe trauma cases, there are many different cellular systems of mineralized hard and unmineralized soft tissues involved, each with varying potential for healing. Furthermore, the responses of the different tissues may be interrelated and dependent on each other. Hence, healing subsequent to dental trauma has long been known to be very complex. Because of this complexity, tissue responses and the consequences following dental trauma have been confusing and puzzling for many clinicians. In this review, the tissue responses are described under the tissue compartments typically involved following dental trauma: the pulp, periradicular and associated soft tissues. The factors involved in the mechanisms of trauma are analysed for their effects on the tissue responses. A thorough understanding of the possible tissue responses is imperative for clinicians to overcome the confusion and manage dental trauma adequately and conservatively in order to minimize the consequences following trauma.

AB  - Abstract??? Traumatized teeth present a clinical challenge with regard to their diagnosis, treatment plan, and prognosis. Recent developments in imaging systems have enabled clinicians to visualize structural changes effectively. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and cone beam computed tomography are among the most commonly used systems for dental and maxillofacial surgery. The purpose of this review is to describe the advantages and disadvantages of each technique and the clinical application for dento-alveolar trauma. Three clinical cases are described to illustrate the potential use of the NewTom 3G for diagnosis and treatment plan of dento-alveolar traumatic injuries.

AB  - Owing to the potentially devastating effects of trauma-induced depression, explaining the relationship between trauma and depressive symptoms is important. In this study, we measured lifelong exposure to potentially traumatic events and depressive symptoms in 370-female undergraduates. We also measured anxiety, past negative time perspective and dissociation as potential mediators. Trauma exposure and depressive symptoms were related with a small but significant effect size (r = .16). Trauma was not associated with dissociation. We found that past negative time perspective and anxiety were full statistical mediators of this trauma-depressive symptoms relationship. These two mediators combined accounted for all of the variance in that association. Anxiety accounted for more of the variance than past negative time perspective. A proposed explanation is that trauma both affectively elevates anxiety and cognitively creates an enduring focus on the events. Chronic anxiety and a past negative time perspective may lead to depression over time. The clinical implications are possible explanations as to why some treatments work.
