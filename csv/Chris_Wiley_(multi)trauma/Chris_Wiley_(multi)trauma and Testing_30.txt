AB  - Post-traumatic headache (PTH) is an important public health issue ? head injuries are common, headache is the most common sequelae of head injuries, and PTH can be particularly disabling. Fortunately, for most individuals with PTH, the headache gradually dissipates over a period of several days, weeks, or months either spontaneously or aided by non-pharmacologic and/or pharmacologic management. Regrettably, for a minority of head-injured individuals, the PTH is intractable and disabling despite aggressive and comprehensive treatment. Unfortunately, there are many prejudices against individuals with PTH. Frequently, the presence or absence of litigation and/or the mechanism of head injury (sports-related trauma, slip-and-fall injury, motor vehicle accident, or military service-related injury) biases physicians' views on the legitimacy of the patient's PTH. Accordingly, this review attempts to summarize the state of the art of our understanding of PTH. This clinical review highlights: (a) views on PTH throughout the last few centuries, (b) the ICHD-2 classification of PTH, (c) the epidemiology of head injuries and PTH, (d) the clinical characteristics of PTH, (e) PTH related postconcussive symptoms, (f) pathophysiology of PTH, (g) evaluation of PTH, and (h) management of PTH.

AB  - Purpose Typically, apolipoproteins are individually measured in blood by immunoassay. In this report, we describe the development of a multiplexed selected reaction monitoring (SRM) based assay for a panel of apolipoproteins and its application to a clinical cohort of samples derived from acute stroke patients. Experimental Design An SRM assay for a panel of nine apolipoproteins was developed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Quantitative data for each apolipoprotein were analyzed to determine expression ratio and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) values for ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke. Results The optimized SRM assay was used to interrogate a small cohort of well-characterized plasma samples obtained from patients with acute ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. The ROC analyses demonstrated good classification power for several single apolipoproteins, most notably apoC-III and apoC-I. When a novel multi-marker ROC algorithm was applied, the ischemic versus hemorrhagic groups were best differentiated by a combination of apoC-III and apoA-I with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.92. Conclusions and clinical relevance This proof-of-concept study provides interesting and provocative data for distinguishing ischemic versus hemorrhage within first week of symptom onset. However, the observations are based on one cohort of patient samples and further confirmation will be required.

AB  - Following the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the introduction of testing for erythropoietin in elite athletes, it became apparent that many athletes had reverted to blood doping using homologous and autologous transfusions. The Science and Industry Against Blood doping research consortium approached Dr Nelson at RPAH to determine if a test could be developed to detect recent blood transfusions. A grant was provided by the US Anti-Doping Agency to develop a flow cytometric assay which detects the expression of a panel of minor blood group antigens. Most blood bank reagents are IgM and are not satisfactory as they cause aggregation. A series of IgG polyclonal antibodies were sourced and the optimal titre of each antibody to detect minor negative and positive red cell populations in in vitro mixtures was determined. The test was validated by four Sydney flow cytometry laboratories who tested unknown samples in a proficiency exercise. In April 2004, IOC, WADA and ATHOC agreed to introduce the test into the Athens laboratory in time for the 2004 Olympics with assistance from RPAH. From May till August, RPAH sourced suitable antibodies, performed antibody titrations, provided a standard operating procedure, consulted daily with both the Athens lab and the Anti-doping lab in Lausanne and conducted a series of 3 Proficiency Testing exercises for both labs. No false positives were found in 254 antibody/sample test combinations. The Athens lab used a panel which included antibodies to C, c, E, Jka, Jkb, Fyb, Fyb, M, N and S. Reagents for anti s, K and e were also provided by RPAH. Two weeks before the Games, the lab personnel moved into the IOC Athens Testing lab. A total of 350 endurance athletes were tested. This included placegetters plus randomly selected competitors.

AB  - Introduction The ability to accurately assess equine oxygen consumption (VO2) under field conditions has been limited by the need for unrestricted gas exchange. Methods Two variations of a mask and an associated electronics control module (ECM) were designed to enable breath-by-breath measurement of airflows with two 8.0?cm diameter pneumotachometers located 7.5?cm in front of each narus and connected to differential pressure transducers mounted on the outside of the mask. The ECM was comprised of electronics for signal filtering to the flow transducers, an oxygen sensing cell, and an analog-to-digital converter all powered by a lithium-ion battery. The battery also powered a pump connected to gas sampling ports between the nares and pneumotachometers. Airflow and oxygen content of inspired and expired gases were recorded through the ECM and electronically transferred to a notebook. VO2 was determined from these recordings by an operator using a customized software analysis program. One mask encased the lower head (E). The other left the jaw free so horse could wear a bit and be ridden (R). Multiple treadmill exercise tests were undertaken by 6 horses to measure VO2max and blood gases. Each mask was worn twice and results compared to those from an open flow-through system (O) by 2-way RMANOVA (P<0.05). Utility of the system was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient of 4 independent raters. Results Blood gases and VO2max (152.0?±?4.0 (mean?±?SEM; O), 147.7?±?4.3 (E), 150.7?±?3.3 (R) ml/(kg.min) were not different between masks. VO2 measures were reproducible for each mask. Agreement between the 4 raters was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient?=?0.99). Conclusions Masks capable of measuring VO2 during field exercise were developed, tested and found accurate by multiple users. Ethical Animal Research Studies performed were approved by the Institution's Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #3807). Sources of funding:?Institutional sources. Competing interests:?Washington State University has filed notice of its intent to apply for a patent for facemask used in this study.

AB  - Abstract Despite the contrasts in chemistry and toxicity, for blister and nerve chemical warfare agents there may be some analogous proteolytic and in?ammatory mediators and pathological pathways that can be pharmacological targets for a single-drug multi-threat medical countermeasure. The dermal?epidermal separation caused by proteases and bullous diseases compared with that observed following exposure to the blister agent sulfur mustard (2,2?-dichlorodiethyl sul?de) has fostered the hypothesis that sulfur mustard vesication involves proteolysis and in?ammation. In conjunction with the paramount toxicological event of cholinergic crisis that causes acute toxicity and precipitates neuronal degeneration, both anaphylactoid reactions and pathological proteolytic activity have been reported in nerve-agent-intoxicated animals. Two classes of drugs already have demonstrated multi-threat activity for both nerve and blister agents. Serine protease inhibitors can prolong the survival of animals intoxicated with the nerve agent soman and can also protect against vesication caused by the blister agent sulfur mustard. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors can reduce both soman-induced neuronal degeneration and sulfur-mustard-induced epidermal necrosis. Protease and PARP inhibitors, like many of the other countermeasures for blister and nerve agents, have potent primary or secondary anti-in?ammatory pharmacology. Accordingly, we hypothesize that drugs with anti-in?ammatory actions against either nerve or blister agent might also display multi-threat ef?cacy for the in?ammatory pathogenesis of both classes of chemical warfare agent.

AB  - Abstract C-reactive protein (CRP) is a nonspecific biomarker of inflammation and infection that can be used as a predictive risk marker of cardiovascular disease in asymptomatic individuals or as a prognostic marker of recurrent ischemia and death among patients with coronary heart disease or stroke. We developed a sensitive, disposable, and easy to operate sensor based on heterogeneous sandwich immunoassay for high sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) measurement. We used screen-printed electrodes modified with multi-walled carbon nanotubes and protein A to ensure the oriented immobilization of anti-CRP antibodies. CRP was quantitatively measured down to a concentration of 0.5?ng mL?1, enabling high dilution of the samples before measurement and consequently reducing interferences present in the serum. The sensor developed is suitable for point of care detection of hs-CRP at clinically relevant concentrations for the diagnosis of both conventional and low-grade inflammations.

AB  - Abstract Background Single-event multi-level chemoneurolysis (SEMLC) is a single-session procedure that treats various limbs of patients with spasticity at multiple levels with chemoneurolytic agents. Phenol is used in combination with botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) to enable spastic muscles to be treated without overdosing with BTX-A. Objective To review unintended effects (UEs) of SEMLC for children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP). Design Retrospective chart review. Setting Pediatric rehabilitation outpatient clinic at an academic medical center. Participants The study included 98 children with CP who underwent SEMLC on at least one occasion. Interventions SEMLC. Main Outcome Measures UEs, the goal achievement for each SEMLC session, and the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS-ER). Results A total of 98 subjects and 146 SEMLC procedures were reviewed. Patients had a mean age of 7.56 years (standard deviation, 4.28); 57% were male; and 14 had hemiplegia, 22 had diplegia, 8 had triplegia, and 54 had quadriplegia. Most SEMLCs (72%) were performed with a combination of BTX-A and 5% phenol in a session. UEs were reported for 31/146 (21%) of SEMLC sessions, with 16 of 31 UEs being temporary weakness. The overall incidence of UEs of the group that received combined agent treatment was not different from the group that received BTX-A only (P = .267). Transient pain occurred in 7 of 105 patients who were treated with the combined agents BTX-A and phenol. Dysesthesia did not develop in any of the patients. The type of CP, GMFCS level, number of muscles injected, and doses of medications were not correlated with the incidence of UEs. Conclusions SEMLC using combined BTX-A and phenol is a safe procedure for children with spastic CP. It could be a treatment option for patients with diffuse spasticity, because combining agents allowed more muscles to be treated without enduring or serious UEs. Patient and family education is essential to prepare them for the occurrence of common UEs, such as temporary weakness and pain.

AB  - Abstract Survival from cancer has improved over the past decade resulting in more long-term survivors. The literature on multi-dimensional quality of life (QOL) among long-term (5+ years) adult survivors is reviewed for each of seven cancer sites (i.e. breast, ovarian, cervical, prostate, colorectal, head and neck, and Hodgkin's disease survivors). Overall, long-term survivors experience good to excellent QOL. Physical domain QOL was the most frequently measured while spiritual domain QOL was the least frequently measured. QOL varies according to treatment received and by age for all groups with older persons (excepting head and neck and Hodgkin's disease survivors) reporting better QOL. QOL improves with time for breast cancer survivors and tends to decrease over time for prostate cancer survivors. Issues regarding sexual functioning affected the social domain?especially for breast and prostate cancer survivors. Social support improves psychological domain QOL for breast, cervical, and colorectal survivors. Review of findings may assist researchers and clinicians wishing to enhance the QOL of the long-term survivor population by identifying the most pressing and widely experienced concerns and by providing directions for future research.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aims The gold standard procedure after a severe nerve injury is the nerve autograft, yet this technique has drawbacks. In recent years, progress has been made in the development of artificial nerve guides to replace the autograft, but no device has been able to demonstrate superiority. The present study introduces an adaptable foundation design for peripheral nerve regeneration. Methods Silk fibroin was electrospun, creating a tri-layered material with aligned fiber surfaces and a randomly deposited fiber interior. This material was rolled into a micro-channeled conduit, which was then enveloped by a jacket layer of the same tri-layered material. Results The proposed implant design succeeds in incorporating various desirable aspects of synthetic nerve guides, while facilitating the surgical implantation process for medical application. The aligned fiber surfaces of the conduit support axon guidance, while the tri-layered architecture improves its structural integrity compared with a fully aligned fiber material. Moreover, the jacket layer creates a small niche on each end which facilitates surgical implantation. An in vivo study in rats showed that nerve regeneration using this device was comparable to results after direct suture. Conclusion This proof-of-principle study, therefore, advances the development of tissue engineered nerve grafts by creating an optimized guidance conduit design capable of successful nerve regeneration.

AB  - Clinico-pathological studies have shown that the clinical diagnosis of multi-infarct dementia (MID) is even more difficult than that of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). The study evaluated the significance of course characteristics for the diagnosis of MID and DAT. Course characteristics were rated when 57 demented patients were admitted to our neurogeriatric department. Diagnosis of MID and DAT, respectively, was established after a follow-up study with repeated neurological, psychiatric and neuropsychological investigations. In 21 cases diagnosis was confirmed by postmortem neuropathology. MID lacked the typical course of the disease in about two thirds of patients, while most DAT patients presented with the typical course of primary degenerative dementia. Features of the ?typical? clinical course of MID (abrupt onset, stepwise deterioration) helped to exclude DAT, whereas MID could not be excluded on the basis of a history of insidious onset and gradual decline.

AB  - Low back pain patients (n=142) on sick leave for at least 8 weeks were given a multi-modal cognitive behavioural treatment program (MMCBT) that lasted for 4 weeks. Before treatment, all patients were tested with a comprehensive test battery. The outcome at 12-month follow-up was predictable from the pretest, but only when combining medical and psychological data. Patients who returned to work (Returners, 50%) in the MMCBT group were characterised by less pain, more psychological strength, were evaluated by the physiotherapist as having a good prognosis for return to work, and were less educated. Patients who did not return to work (Non-returners) in the MMCBT group felt tense and unfit, felt hopelessness concerning the future, were less physically active, thought their complaints would worsen if they continued working, and reported fewer difficulties driving a car. Returners to work (58%) in the randomised control group (n=81), who received ordinary physical therapy, were characterised by high levels of energy, less subjective health complaints, less exhaustion for a condition test, and did not work in positions giving a constant load on the back. There was no significant differences between number of patients who had returned to work in the MMCBT and the control group. Non-returners in the control group lacked energy, trained less regularly, worked in occupations that gave an almost constant load on the back, and did not expect to be back to work in the course of a couple of weeks. It seems to be important to develop further diagnostic tools to identify those who might benefit from extensive or specific treatments.

AB  - Systemic adenosine has been shown in earlier case reports and a small placebo-controlled study to reducepathological sensory dysfunction such as tactile allodynia in neuropathic pain. To evaluate this further, the effects of systemic adenosine infusion (50 ?g/kg/min for 60 min) on tactile sensory dysfunction and pain was evaluated in 26 patients suffering peripheral neuropathic pain characterized by dynamic tactile allodynia. A randomized, cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled technique was used in this multi-centre study. Psychophysical methods were used to evaluate sensory dysfunction and spontaneous pain. The area of dynamic tactile allodynia was significantly reduced by adenosine compared with placebo (p=0.043), but spon-taneous pain and tactile pain threshold were not significantly improved compared with the effects of placebo treatment. As a secondary outcome, a higher incidence of positive subjective effects on the clinical pain condi-tion, in a few cases with long duration (several months), following adenosine treatment was found when theglobal effect of respective treatment was assessed (p=0.028). The results demonstrate involvement of adenosine receptor-sensitive pain mechanisms in some aspects of the sensory dysfunction often found in neuropathic pain.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective To conduct interrater reliability testing of the Maternal Fetal Triage Index (MFTI), a standardized tool for obstetric triage. Design Observational study of a convenience sample of nurses? triage assessments of hospital-based obstetric patients. Setting A birth unit of a suburban hospital located in a large metropolitan region with approximately 5,200 births annually. Participants Ten registered nurses provided triage assessments of 211 pregnant women. Methods Using blinded paired triage assessments, we assessed the reproducibility of the triage priority levels assigned using the MFTI. Results Priority levels assigned by the MFTI research nurse and the study nurses were in agreement for 154 of the 211 (72.9%) triage assessments. The strength of agreement was classified as good based upon the weighted kappa score of 0.65. There was no statistically significant difference in the accuracy of assigning priority levels between the day and night shifts Conclusion The interrater reliability of the MFTI met the minimum strength of agreement threshold goal of 0.60 when used by nurses in a large birth unit to assign priority for evaluation. Based on this finding, the MFTI can be recommended for use in obstetric triage settings. Additional testing should be done to measure how this standardized tool improves care processes and outcomes.

Methods:? From January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2003, one hundred patients attended in a general dermatology unit were recruited for patch testing. Every patient underwent testing with the standard tray recommended by the Spanish Contact Dermatitis Research Group, and simultaneously, with a supplementary series of 35 allergens. Other specific series were performed in some cases, but their results have been omitted in this study. Patients with positive allergic reactions were divided into two groups based on the clinical relevance of their reactions. These groups were subsequently stratified in four subgroups: (1) reactions only to allergens in the standard series; (2) reactions only to additional allergens; (3) reactions to both standard and additional allergens; and (4) reactions to own substances or allergens in other series. Results:? Of patients tested, 62 had at least 1 positive allergic reaction, and among these, 44 had reactions deemed clinically relevant. Of all the patients with relevant positive tests, 70.5%(31/44) reacted only to allergens in the standard tray; 11.4%(5/44) reacted to supplementary allergens exclusively; 4.5%(2/44) reacted to both standard and supplementary allergens. Finally, 6 more patients (13.6%) reacted to other sensitizers. Conclusion:? In our study, 15.9% relevant allergies would have been missed by the standard series alone. Patch testing an extended standard series increased our diagnostic capability, and might be a useful screening tool in those dermatology offices where other series are lacking.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Abdominal metastases (AM) from soft tissue sarcoma (STS) are rare and prognosis is poor. The aims of the study were to (a) identify risk factors for the development of AM and to (b) investigate the outcome of AM-patients. Methods Seven-hundred-sixty-nine STS-patients with localised disease at diagnosis treated at three tumour centres (2000-2016) were retrospectively included (409 males; mean age, 55.6 years [range, 8-96 years]; median follow-up, 4.1 years [interquartile-range, 2.5-6.6 years]). Results Two-hundred-two patients (26.3%) developed secondary metastases, and 24 of them AM (3.1%). Ten patients developed first AM (FAM) after a mean of 2.4 years and 14 patients late AM (LAM, after being diagnosed with metastases to other sites) after a mean of 2.0 years. Patients with liposarcoma had a significantly higher risk of developing AM (P?=?.007), irrespective of grading. There was no difference in post-metastasis-survival (PMS) between patients with AM at any time point and those with metastases to other sites (P?=?.585). Patients with LAM or FAM showed no difference in post-abdominal-metastasis-survival (P?=?.884). Conclusions Survival in patients with AM is poor, irrespective of whether they develop secondarily to other metastases or not. Patients at high-risk of AM (ie, liposarcoma) may be followed-up regularly by abdominal-ultrasound/CT.

AB  - Introduction Endurance horses must attain heart rates below a certain limit (usually 64 beats/min) to pass veterinary inspections in endurance rides. The time necessary for heart rate recovery is therefore important in this equestrian discipline. The objective was to determine heart rate (HR) and heart rate recovery time (HRtime) of endurance horses exercised at various velocities. Methods Twelve Arabian endurance horses completed an incremental field exercise test with concurrent ECG-recording. Horses were actively competing at distances of 80?160?km. The exercise protocol defined five intervals with intended velocity range of 11?13?km/h, 15?17?km/h, 18?20?km/h, 21?25?km/h, and >25?km/h, respectively. Each interval was terminated by a halt lasting until HR declined to 64 beats/min. Velocity was determined by a global positioning system, while HR and HRtime were calculated from the ECG. Descriptive statistics was performed. Results Velocity, HR and HRtime (as mean?±?SD); Interval 1: 12.4?±?0.9?km/h, 104?±?11 beats/min, 50?±?34?s; Interval 2: 15.9?±?0.5?km/h, 120?±?9 beats/min, 128?±?81?s; Interval 3: 20.0?±?0.6?km/h, 133?±?10 beats/min, 202?±?120?s; Interval 4: 22.9?±?1.0?km/h, 140?±?11 beats/min, 264?±?170?s; and Interval 5: 29.3?±?3.8?km/h, 171?±?15 beats/min, 341?±?187?s. HR showed linear correlation with velocity. HRtime varied between horses especially after greater velocities, with a tendency of being shortest in the best performing horses. Four outliers of HRtime were excluded from horses reluctant to stand still during the halt due to anticipatory excitement. Conclusions Heart rate recovery time shows great individuality and could potentially be used as a performance indicator in endurance horses. Possible fluctuations of HR due to anticipatory excitement during the halt may prolong HRtime and must be accounted for.

AB  - Abstract Objective The proportion of adults in Australia meeting or exceeding the national guidelines for physical activity has remained relatively static over the past 10 years. The research objective was to measure self-reported physical activity and sedentary behaviour among ED patients in accordance with Australia's current physical activity and sedentary behaviour guidelines, revised in 2014. Methods A convenience sample of participants was recruited from three EDs in Melbourne between February and May 2016. Eligible participants were administered the International Physical Activity Questionnaire ? Short Form plus researcher-derived questions. Participants were assessed as whether meeting the physical activity guidelines or not, using pre-defined criteria. Results The proportion of 18?64 year olds meeting all of the physical activity guidelines was 19.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 15.2?22.8). A majority of participants (63.1%, 95% CI 58.5?67.7) met the aerobic component of the guidelines although only 28.9% (95% CI 24.5?33.3) of participants reported undertaking strength building exercises two or more times per week. Adults in the oldest age group were found to be less likely to engage in muscle strengthening exercises (23.3%, n = 30) than those in the youngest age group (40.0%, n = 60, P = 0.005). Average daily sitting time (minutes) did not differ between men (median = 300) and women (median = 360, P = 0.118). Conclusions Overall adherence with physical activity guidelines is low among adults attending the ED. All adults need to be encouraged to undertake muscle strengthening activities, especially adults in older age groups.

AB  - Objective To combine and analyse the results from centres with a large experience of laparoscopy for the impalpable testis with small series, to determine the expected success rate for laparoscopic orchidopexy. Methods A questionnaire was distributed to participating paediatric urologists; each contributor retrospectively reviewed the clinical charts for their cases of therapeutic laparoscopy for an impalpable testis, detailing 36 variables for each patient. The data were collated centrally into a computerized database. For inclusion, the testis was intra-abdominal (including ?peeping? at the internal ring) at laparoscopic examination, was not managed through an open approach and did not undergo orchidectomy. Three surgical groups were assessed, with success defined as lack of atrophy and intrascrotal position: group 1, primary laparoscopic orchidopexy; group 2, a one-stage Fowler-Stephens (F-S) orchidopexy; and group 3, a two-stage F-S orchidopexy. Results Data were gathered from 10 centres in the USA, covering the period 1990?1999; 252 patients representing 310 testes were included and overall, 15.2% were lost to follow-up. There was no significant difference between success rates in the larger and smaller series. Atrophy occurred in 2.2% of 178 testes, 22.2% of 27 testes and 10.3% of 58 testes in groups 1?3, respectively. Testes were not in a satisfactory scrotal position in 0.6%, 7.4% and 1.7% of groups 1?3, respectively. The mean follow-up for each group was 7.7, 8.6 and 20.0?months, respectively. The overall success for all groups was 92.8% (97.2% group 1; 74.1% group 2; 87.9% group 3), with an atrophy rate of 6.1%. Conclusion Laparoscopic orchidopexy for the intra-abdominal testis, in both large and small series, can be expected to have a success rate higher than that historically ascribed to open orchidopexy. Within this series, single-stage F-S laparoscopic orchidopexy resulted in a significantly higher atrophy rate than the two-stage repair. However, when considering both F-S approaches, the laparoscopic approach gave greater success than previously reported for the same open approaches. Despite the weaknesses inherent in a retrospective unrandomized study, we conclude that laparoscopic orchidopexy is, if not the procedure of choice, an acceptable and successful approach to the impalpable undescended testicle.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Point-of-care International Normalised Ratio (INR) testing is used frequently. We evaluated the microINR? POC system for accuracy, precision and measurement repeatability, and investigated instrument and test chip variability and error rates. Methods Venous blood INRs of 210 patients on warfarin were obtained with Thromborel? S on the Sysmex CS-2100i? analyser and compared with capillary blood microINR? values. Precision was assessed using control materials. Measurement repeatability was calculated on 51 duplicate finger-prick INRs. Triplicate finger-prick INRs using three different instruments (30 patients) and three different test chip lots (29 patients) were used to evaluate instrument and test chip variability. Results Linear regression analysis of microINR? and Sysmex CS2100i? values showed a correlation coefficient of 0.96 (P < .0001) and a positive proportional bias of 4.4%. Dosage concordance was 93.8% and clinical agreement 95.7%. All acceptance criteria based on ISO standard 17593:2007 system accuracy requirements were met. Control material coefficients of variation (CV) varied from 6.2% to 16.7%. The capillary blood measurement repeatability CV was 7.5%. No significant instrument (P = .93) or test chip (P = .81) variability was found, and the error rate was low (2.8%). Conclusion The microINR? instrument is accurate and precise for monitoring warfarin therapy.
