AB  - SUMMARY From a review of the literature, it can be concluded that it is always advantageous and usually necessary to distribute the casualties of a disaster to several hosp-hospitals rather than allowing 1 hospital, the nearest to the scene, to bear the whole load. The potential of these hospitals would be enhanced if their preparedness and planning included anticipation of their functioning as part of a framework of the entire capacity of the medical services of an entire small country, or a region of a larger one. For the smooth functioning of this framework, central co-ordination and control of the distribution of the load, the movements within it, the strengthening of its various component parts is necessary and services other than medical (transport, communications, etc.) are essential. The establishment of a multihospital system for disaster situations for a whole region is suggested. This would integrate all medical facilities and services of the region, as well as promoting additional services, first horizontally integrated and later vertically, and would have a central governing body with full authority to prepare the system for the calamity and to execute the implementation of the plan when disaster occurs. This body may find it useful to base some of its decision in the planning as well as the implementing stage, on an assumed population of casualties that is characteristic for the region and on implications that may be drawn from the population.

AB  - Summary The incidence of multiple pregnancies continues to rise, in part due to the increasing use of assisted reproduction techniques. Due to the serious maternal and perinatal complications with multiple pregnancies and the further increased risks with higher order multiples, selective fetal reduction has been offered in an attempt to improve perinatal outcomes. This invasive, ultrasound-guided, percutaneous procedure has theoretical risks of pregnancy loss, morbidity to the surviving fetuses and associated risks of premature ruptured membranes and preterm labour. It also evokes complex ethical and moral issues for the parents, clinicians and society as a whole. Pregnancy outcome rates have improved following selective fetal reduction as experience with techniques have improved and the number of very high order pregnancies has reduced.

AB  - We reviewed our experience patch testing to plastics at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, England. The department?s electronic database was searched from June 2002 to December 2003. In total 434 patients where patch tested to the British Standard Series. All positive reactions to epoxy resin and p-tert-Butylphenol-Formaldehyde resin (PTBF)where recorded. 28 of the patients tested to the Standard Series where also tested to an extended Plastics Series and again positive reactions where recorded. Type-4 mediated hypersensitivity reactions where seen in, 3 men secondary to epoxy resin, 2 men secondary to PTBF and in 1 women secondary to triethylene glycol acrylate. No irritant reactions where recorded. Epoxy resin was thought to be the cause of an occupational allergic hand dermatitis in 2 of the men. The positive reactions in the other patients where felt not to be of current relevance to their dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis to plastic appears to be rare in patients attending for patch testing in Sheffield. In particular the frequency of reactions to epoxy resin, a potent sensitizer, is less than 1%. This is perhaps surprising as Sheffield is a large industrial city where exposure to epoxy resins is likely to be common. Hopefully this reflects safe workin practices in Sheffield.

AB  - Summary This chapter begins with an introduction of the anatomy of the ankle and foot. Appropriateness criteria for imaging foot and ankle trauma are then discussed. The ankle and foot are anatomically distinct from each other and therefore radiographic evaluation of each is different from the other. Standard ankle radiographs include anteroposterior (AP), lateral, and mortise view, and foot radiographs include AP, lateral, and oblique views. Computed Tomography (CT) is used for pre-operative planning in patients with complex distal tibial and malleolar fractures, tarsal fractures and Lisfranc fracture-dislocations. Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging is indicated in assessment of radiographically occult stress and insufficiency fractures. In the setting of foot and ankle trauma, ultrasound is often performed to evaluate the Achilles tendon for the presence and severity of a tear. The key to interpreting ankle and foot radiographs is familiarity with normal anatomy and injury patterns that may involve the ankle and foot.

AB  - Abstract Given the increased demand on genetic services, it is important to identify clients who may require relatively more extensive psychosocial support. This paper describes which client characteristics, as assessed in the first psycho-social counselling session, were associated with requiring relatively more psycho-social support (≥3 sessions) in the process of predictive testing for cancer. The study population consisted of 244 counselees for hereditary cancer. Data were derived from an electronic data-base, used by psycho-social workers for the systematic registration of relevant details of each counselling session. Data were analysed for two respective groups: (A) patients who had a known mutation in the family and (B) patients with an as yet unknown mutation in the family. Results show that two or more psychosocial sessions were given if the information derived from the first session indicated the client to have childhood experiences with cancer (in group A), to experience the family role and/or the psychological impact as burdensome (in both groups) or to experience the social impact as burdensome (in group B). We conclude that the first assessment by a psychosocial worker already provides valuable information on the psychological support needs of patients. These findings provide insight into possible problem areas for clients dealing with predictive genetic testing.

AB  - Abstract Each year, 1.4 million people in the United States are seen in a hospital for a traumatic brain injury. Those with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury frequently go through a course of inpatient neurorehabilitation prior to discharge back into the community. A broad overview of neurorehabilitation is presented, including the standards for admission to inpatient rehabilitation and the members and roles of the neurorehabilitation team. Common medical complications that are managed after moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury are reviewed. The spectrum of arousal issues is summarized. The evidence regarding neurorehabilitation is then reviewed. Future studies that are underway to better understand the utility of neurorehabilitation are then discussed.

AB  - Abstract Background Great advancements have been made in patient and public involvement (PPI), including the development of guidance on how to conduct, report and evaluate PPI. Despite these efforts, the evidence base remains relatively weak. A substantive methodological development is required. This is particularly important for vulnerable groups within society, for whom PPI can be challenging but has the potential to play a transformative role in shaping research. Objectives To describe the group dynamic characteristics and immediate impact of PPI from the user representatives? perspective in a case study of refugee involvement in the development of mental health intervention research. To pilot and methodologically appraise the Active Involvement of Users in Research Observation Schedule and Questionnaire. Design The Active Involvement of Users in Research Observation Schedule and Questionnaire were administered together with a focus group discussion. Setting ?Refugee Advisors? were involved in the development of a randomized controlled trial protocol evaluating a brief group intervention for refugee children experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress in Sweden. Results The multi-method approach demonstrated good feasibility. There were clear examples of how the advisors influenced research development. The advisors described a perceived impact on the research, equality and acceptance, and knowledge gain. A sense of appreciation and empowerment was also interpreted. However, potential issues relating to the relevance of contributions and use of an interpreter were identified. Discussion and conclusion The methodological approach piloted in this study offers a promising, rigorous way to evaluate PPI. The research tools require further refinement and validation.

AB  - Background: Severe periodontal furcation invasion has long been a treatment dilemma for the clinician. Many techniques have been advocated in the treatment of multi-rooted posterior teeth ranging from conventional scaling and root planing (SRP), apically positioned flaps, root amputations, root resections, tunnel procedures, guided tissue regeneration, and restorations. The keys to success depend on the clinician's ability to access the furcation to remove local factors and create an environment that enhances the patient's own hygiene efforts. Long-term success in treating teeth with furcation invasion depends upon tooth retention and arresting the destructive processes within the furcation area. Methods: A Class III furcation invasion in a mandibular molar was treated by surgical access for SRP along with obliterating the furcation utilizing a resin ionomer restoration. Results: Initially, the patient was asymptomatic. Within 3 months of treatment, the patient presented with suppuration that was refractory to local efforts. Radiographs taken only 5 months postsurgery demonstrated advanced bone loss apical to the restoration. The tooth ultimately was extracted because mobility increased and the tooth became symptomatic. Conclusions: The clinician must consider the multi-factorial etiology of periodontal breakdown within a furcation. For this patient, the technique of sealing off the exposed furcation with restorative material appeared to have resulted in progressive bone loss and accelerate tooth loss. This single case report is presented as a rebuttal to recently published articles, which have demonstrated excellent results when treating furcations with ionomer restorations.

AB  - The ultimate promise of diffusion MRI (dMRI) models is specificity to neuronal microstructure, which may lead to distinct clinical biomarkers using noninvasive imaging. While multi-compartment models are a common approach to interpret water diffusion in the brain in vivo, the estimation of their parameters from the dMRI signal remains an unresolved problem. Practically, even when q space is highly oversampled, nonlinear fit outputs suffer from heavy bias and poor precision. So far, this has been alleviated by fixing some of the model parameters to a priori values, for improved precision at the expense of accuracy. Here we use a representative two-compartment model to show that fitting fails to determine the five model parameters from over 60 measurement points. For the first time, we identify the reasons for this poor performance. The first reason is the existence of two local minima in the parameter space for the objective function of the fitting procedure. These minima correspond to qualitatively different sets of parameters, yet they both lie within biophysically plausible ranges. We show that, at realistic signal-to-noise ratio values, choosing between the two minima based on the associated objective function values is essentially impossible. Second, there is an ensemble of very low objective function values around each of these minima in the form of a pipe. The existence of such a direction in parameter space, along which the objective function profile is very flat, explains the bias and large uncertainty in parameter estimation, and the spurious parameter correlations: in the presence of noise, the minimum can be randomly displaced by a very large amount along each pipe. Our results suggest that the biophysical interpretation of dMRI model parameters crucially depends on establishing which of the minima is closer to the biophysical reality and the size of the uncertainty associated with each parameter.

Study Design Experimental study. Sample Population Cadaveric, skeletally mature canine pelvic limb pairs (n = 8). Methods Pelvic limbs disarticulated at the coxofemoral joint were randomly assigned to the following 1 of 4 groups: (1) limbs had complete transection of the CrCL; (2) limbs had complete transection of the CdCL; (3) limbs had complete transection of both ligaments; and (4) both ligaments were left intact. Participants performed the DT and the TCT and a diagnosis was given based on the DT and on the combination of these tests. Results DT had a poor sensitivity for correctly identifying CrCL (69%), CdCL (45%), and TCL (26%) rupture, but had a high sensitivity when identifying intact limbs (97%). Specificity for DT was greatest when identifying limbs with CdCL (97%) and TCL (92%) rupture, and the lowest when palpating limbs with CrCL rupture (75%). Combining DT and TCT did not increase sensitivity or specificity values, nor did an increased level of evaluator training. Conclusions Independent of evaluator training, the DT alone or combined with the TCT poorly differentiates the cause of stifle instability associated with CrCL, CdCL, and TCL rupture.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to investigate the neurofunctional alterations in both acute and chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from the same stress experience. Methods Brain responses to emotional trauma-related and neutral pictures with a symptom provocation task were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-four PTSD patients resulting from a mining accident and 14 controls exposed to the same accident without PTSD two months post-trauma were recruited. In the follow-up study 20 PTSD patients and 14 controls were also recruited after 24 months post-trauma. Correlations were conducted in PTSD between altered fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals of areas extracted as regions of interest and three Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) subscores respectively. Results In response to picture stimulus (traumatic negative pictures versus neutral pictures), the acute PTSD group showed greater activation in the bilateral posterior cingulate gyri, left precuneus, right fusiform and left parahippocampal gyrus than the chronic PTSD group (P?<?0.001, cluster size?>?20 voxels). In the acute PTSD group, BOLD signals of either posterior cingulate gyrus correlated positively with CAPS intrusion subscores. There was also no significant correlation between BOLD signals of five regions mentioned above in the chronic PTSD group and three CAPS subscores. Discussion These findings suggested that brain circuits affected in acute PTSD may be more extended than chronic PTSD. The reason may due to the formation of traumatic memory in the acute phase of PTSD.

AB  - Abstract Aim This study aimed to determine the frequency of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on neuroimaging and the need for emergency neurosurgery in children with normal mental status following a post-traumatic seizure (PTS). Methods We searched six electronic databases from inception to October 15, 2018, to identify studies including children under 18 years with head injury and a Glasgow Coma Score of 15 after an immediate PTS. Relevant non-English articles were translated to determine eligibility. Results We performed random effect meta-analyses and assessed heterogeneity with I2. The pooled estimate of the frequency of TBI, from seven studies, was 13.0% (95% CI: 4.0?26.1; I2 = 81%). Data on the need of emergency neurosurgery were reported in four studies and the pooled estimate of its frequency was 2.3% (95% CI: 0.0?9.9; I2 = 86%). Two studies reported on children with isolated PTS without any other signs of head injury, representing 0.1% of patients in both studies, for a total of 76 children. Of these, only three had TBI and one underwent neurosurgery. Conclusion Children with immediate PTS and normal mental status frequently have TBI with a substantial need for neurosurgery. Clinicians should strongly consider neuroimaging for these children, although prolonged observation may be considered for those with isolated PTS.

AB  - Abstract Objective To test the hypothesis that disordered eating in second- and third-generation women would be related to their levels of Holocaust exposure and family dysfunction. Method One hundred eight mother-daughter dyads were ascertained through the daughters, all Israeli college students 18--35 years of age. Mothers and daughters assessed themselves on family function, Holocaust exposure and disordered eating. Results The disordered eating of women of the third generation was partially predicted by their mothers' disordered eating and by their mothers' Holocaust exposure. The second generation reported more maternal over-protection and emotional over-involvement than did the third generation. Contrary to expectation, the third-generation women were more Holocaust exposed than were the second generation. Discussion The nature of Holocaust exposure for second and third generations needs further study and clarification in relation to disordered eating. There is considerable disparity between the results of clinical and qualitative studies which tend to find a strong relationship between Holocaust exposure and psychopathology, and population-based quantitative studies which tend to find a much weaker relationship.

AB  - Identifying and characterizing top predators? use of trophic resources provides important information about animal ecology and their response to changing conditions. Information from sources such as stable isotopes can be used to infer changes in resource use as direct observations in the wild are difficult to obtain, particularly in the marine environment. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values were recovered from the canine teeth of grey seals collected from haul outs in the central North Sea in the 1970/1980s (n = 44) and 2000s (n = 25), spanning a period of marked ecosystem changes in the region. Extracting material deposited during juvenile and adult life-stages, we reconstructed a multi-decadal record of δ15N and δ13C variation. Using established correlations between stable isotope ratios and sea bottom temperature we created a proxy for baseline isotopic variability to account for this source of temporal change. We found 1) a significant long-term decline in juvenile grey seal δ15N values, suggesting trophic position has decreased over time; 2) a decline in adult δ15N values and contraction in stable isotopic niche space after the North Sea regime shift, signifying both a decline in trophic position and change in foraging habits over the 20th century; and 3) evidence for dietary segregation between juvenile and adult animals, showing juvenile individuals feeding at a lower trophic position and in more nearshore areas than adults. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of mining archived biological samples to address ecological questions and imply important ontogenetic and long-term shifts in the feeding ecology of a top predator. Long-term changes in grey seal trophic dynamics may be partly in response to well documented ecosystem changes in the North Sea. Such indirect monitoring of marine predators may have utility when set in the context of ecosystem assessments where paucity of long-term monitoring data is prevalent.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ciclosporin therapy alone or in combination with corticosteroids and/or ketoconazole in dogs with diagnosis of meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown aetiology. Methods: Medical records of 10 dogs diagnosed with meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown aetiology and treated with ciclosporin therapy alone or in combination with corticosteroids and/or ketoconazole were reviewed at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Laboratory abnormalities, side effects, clinical and cerebrospinal fluid responses to treatment and association between blood ciclosporin level and response to treatment were evaluated. Histopathological diagnosis was available in three patients. Results: No significant abnormalities were detected on serial complete blood count and serum chemistry panel in any of the dogs. Side effects of ciclosporin therapy included excessive shedding, gingival hyperplasia and hypertrichosis. Overall median survival time for all dogs in the study was 930 days (range, 60 to more than 1290 days). In all dogs, serial cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed a marked improvement in the inflammation. Clinical Significance: Results suggest that ciclosporin either alone or in combination with ketoconazole may be a safe and effective treatment for meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown aetiology in dogs.

AB  - Aims To determine whether the multi-modal web-based rehabilitation ?Move it to improve it? (Mitii) is more effective than wait list control (usual care) to improve occupational performance, upper limb function, and visual perception in children with acquired brain injury (ABI). Method Fifty-eight randomly allocated children (53% males; mean age 11y 11mo, SD 2y 6mo; Manual Abilities Classification Scale equivalent I=32, II=24, III=2; mean Full-scale IQ 75.8, SD 16.2) received either 20 weeks of Mitii (n=29) or usual care (n=29). Mitii comprised upper limb, cognitive, visual perception, and gross motor tasks, recommended for 30 minutes per day, 6 days per week, over 20 weeks. Outcomes were the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS), Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function, Jebsen?Taylor Test of Hand Function, Test of Visual Perceptual Skills, Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA), and Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. The primary comparison at 20 weeks between groups on the AMPS process and motor measures used generalized estimating equations. Results Groups were equivalent at baseline. Participants completed on average 17.6 hours (range 0?46h) of Mitii. There were no differences between groups on the primary outcome (AMPS process: estimated mean difference ?0.1, 95% CI ?0.3 to 0.2, p=0.589; and AMPS motor: estimated mean difference 0.2, 95% CI ?0.1 to 0.5, p=0.192). There were no differences between groups on overall visual perception, upper limb, and occupational performance outcomes. Interpretation Mitii led to negligible changes on all primary and secondary outcomes compared with usual care. This likely reflects the small dose achieved and poses questions around the acceptability and feasibility of home-delivered Mitii in this population of children with ABI.
