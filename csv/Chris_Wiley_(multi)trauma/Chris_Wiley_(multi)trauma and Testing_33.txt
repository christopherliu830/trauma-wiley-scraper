AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury can cause extensive damage to the white matter (WM) of the brain. These disruptions can be especially damaging in children, whose brains are still maturing. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is the most commonly used method to assess WM organization, but it has limited resolution to differentiate causes of WM disruption. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) yields spectra showing the levels of neurometabolites that can indicate neuronal/axonal health, inflammation, membrane proliferation/turnover, and other cellular processes that are on-going post-injury. Previous analyses on this dataset revealed a significant division within the msTBI patient group, based on interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT); one subgroup of patients (TBI-normal) showed evidence of recovery over time, while the other showed continuing degeneration (TBI-slow). We combined dMRI with MRS to better understand WM disruptions in children with moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (msTBI). Tracts with poorer WM organization, as shown by lower FA and higher MD and RD, also showed lower N-acetylaspartate (NAA), a marker of neuronal and axonal health and myelination. We did not find lower NAA in tracts with normal WM organization. Choline, a marker of inflammation, membrane turnover, or gliosis, did not show such associations. We further show that multi-modal imaging can improve outcome prediction over a single modality, as well as over earlier cognitive function measures. Our results suggest that demyelination plays an important role in WM disruption post-injury in a subgroup of msTBI children and indicate the utility of multi-modal imaging.

AB  - Background:? Drug eruptions as maculopapular rash, hypersensitivity syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis occur in about 2% of patients taking allopurinol. The allopurinol oxidation product ? oxypurinol ? seems to be responsible for these hypersensitivity reactions. Opposing what occurs during the study of drug eruptions induced by other drugs as carbamazepine or amoxiciline, patch testing with allopurinol is usually negative. Objective:? To evaluate skin reactivity to allopurinol and oxypurinol by patch testing in patients with a previous history of drug eruption related with allopurinol. Methods:? 10 patients (6 females and 4 males) with drug eruptions induced by allopurinol with a high imputability index (6 hypersensitivity syndromes, 2 Stevens-Johnson syndromes, 1 erythroderma and 1 toxic epidermal necrolysis) were patch tested with allopurinol in vaseline (10 and 20%) and with oxypurinol in vaseline (10 and 20%), acetone (10 and 20%) and alcohol (10 and 20%). Results:? Patch tests with allopurinol and oxypurinol were invariably negative after 48 and 96 hours in all patients tested. Conclusion:? Patch testing with oxypurinol as well as with allopurinol is usually negative and therefore is not helpful in the confirmation of these hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol.

AB  - Abstract Purpose Access to mental health care and programs that address violence prevention can be a challenge for veterans residing in rural and underserved areas. A growing number of trauma-affected veterans are now returning to rural areas upon completion of military service. The Palo Alto VA Health Care System has piloted a program known as the Peer Support Program (PSP) where certified peer support specialists hold group sessions for their fellow veterans in remote, community-based outpatient clinics. Methods A total of 29 peer-support group participants and 1 certified peer specialist were interviewed. Semistructured interviews began with open-ended questions regarding participant firsthand experiences with the support group setting. These were followed by direct questions that addressed the role of the PSP, expectations for the PSP, as well as benefits and limitations of the program. We performed a domain analysis using the Spradley ethnographic method on 325 pages of compiled narrative data focusing on violence-related themes. Findings Four key themes emerged, including: 1) Violence in Military Training Not Acceptable in Civilian Life, 2) Peer Support Creates the Trust to Speak Freely, 3) Skills Are Taught to Defuse Violence, and 4) The Veteran Peer Support Specialist Relationship Is Multi-Dimensional. Conclusions These emergent themes illustrate how trauma-focused assistance rendered by peer support specialists as part of an interdisciplinary mental health team can be implemented to benefit trauma-affected individuals and their communities in the prevention of future violence.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: Diagnosis and treatment of childhood cancer are continuous stressors in the lives of the entire family involved. Disease-related tools for the assessment of parental stress and adaptation are scarce. For that reason, the Pediatric Inventory for Parents (PIP), a disease-related measure, was translated into Dutch and its psychometric qualities were determined to prove its value. Methods: The PIP and three other measures (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, General Health Questionnaire and Parenting Stress Index, Short Form) were administered to 174 parents of 107 children diagnosed with cancer in three university medical centers in the Netherlands. Results: Internal consistency (Crohnbach's α=0.94 and 0.95) and test?retest reliability (Pearson's r between 0.67 and 0.87) of the Dutch PIP total scales are satisfactory. Validity was illustrated by a high correlation between PIP-scores and anxiety and general stress. Confirmatory factor analysis showed acceptable fit to the data for the original four-factor and the one-factor models; the four-factor model showed slightly better fit. Conclusion: The PIP can be used in clinical practice to assess disease-related parental stress. Further psychometric testing is highly recommended. Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Trend test based on cross-classified data in dose-response has been a central problem in medicine. Most of existing test methods are known to only fit to binary response variables. However, the approaches for binary response tables may suffer from the lack of a clear choice for dichotomization. For multivariate response with ordered categories, some studies have been done for simple stochastic order, likelihood ratio order and so on. However, methods of statistical inference on increasing convex order for more than two multinomial populations have not been fully developed. For testing the increasing convex order alternative, this article provides a model-free test method which can be used in the case of two-way tables and stratified data. Two real examples will be used to illustrate how to apply our test method. (? 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim)

AB  - Abstract The incidence of ovarian cancer is up to 10 times higher in Western countries than in rural Asia and Africa. One common consequence of a Western lifestyle is the development of excessive body weight and obesity. A multi-centre prospective study was conducted to investigate the association between body mass index (BMI) and ovarian cancer risk. A case-control study was nested within 3 prospective cohorts in New York (USA), Umeå (Sweden) and Milan (Italy). Information on anthropometry, demographic characteristics, medical history and lifestyle was obtained at the time of subjects' recruitment in each cohort. Women diagnosed with primary, invasive epithelial ovarian cancer from the 3 cohorts (n = 122) diagnosed 12 months or later after recruitment into the respective cohort served as case subjects. For each case subject, 2 control subjects that matched the case subject on cohort, menopausal status, age and date of recruitment were randomly identified. Data were analyzed by conditional logistic regression. There was an inverse association between BMI and ovarian cancer risk. For increasing quartiles of BMI above the lowest, the ORs were 0.62 (0.32?1.21), 0.59 (0.30?1.17) and 0.46 (0.23?0.92), p = 0.03. Analyses limited to women diagnosed 3 or more years after recruitment into the cohorts did not alter these findings. When obese women (BMI > 30) were compared to lean women (BMI ≤ 23), the inverse association became stronger, with an OR of 0.38 (0.17?0.85), p < 0.02. There was some evidence of direct association of ovarian cancer with height, which was limited to cancers diagnosed before age 55. Our data suggest that increasing body weight may confer a protection against ovarian cancer. ? 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective To test feasibility of a systematic approach to routine screening and response for intimate partner violence among women presenting to three New South Wales EDs. Methods This prospective feasibility study was conducted over 6?months in two rural and one major tertiary metropolitan ED in New South Wales. Women aged 16?45?years triaged category 3?5 (treat within 30?min/1 h/2 h), who could be approached privately, were screened for intimate partner violence using the validated HITS (Hurts, Insults, Threatens and Screams or Swears) tool. The follow-up protocol for patients who disclosed abuse, specified a social work/psychology (psychosocial) response within 1?h. Outcomes of interest were screening rates of eligible presentations, disclosures of abuse, psycho-social referral and responses. Interviews conducted with ED medical directors and nurse unit managers at each site explored barriers and facilitators. Results A total of 1047 women (11.4% of eligible presentations) completed screening at their first or subsequent presentation. Of 868 women screened on first presentation, 18% (n = 154) disclosed intimate partner violence, with no significant differences by age group, country of birth, triage category or time/day of arrival. Key barriers to screening were high patient volume, absence of electronic prompts and lack of privacy. Of those who screened positive 49% (n = 75) received an immediate, on-site psycho-social response. Conclusion The present study demonstrates that it is both possible and relevant, given the 18% disclosure rate, to screen women in relation intimate partner violence in EDs and provide a psycho-social response within 1?h. More needs to be done to address barriers to screening to provide opportunities for early intervention.

AB  - Abstract Background: Hypothermia is commonly used for organ and tissue preservation in multiple clinical settings, but its role in the management of injured patients remains controversial. There is no doubt that temperature modulation is a powerful tool, and hypothermia has been shown to protect cells during ischaemia and reperfusion, decrease organ damage and improve survival. Yet hypothermia is a double-edged sword: unless carefully managed, its induction can be associated with a number of complications. Methods: A literature review was performed to include important papers that address the impact of hypothermia on key biological processes, and explore the potential therapeutic role of hypothermia in trauma/haemorrhage models. Results: No clinical studies have been conducted to test the therapeutic benefits of hypothermia in injured patients. However, numerous well designed animal studies support this concept. Despite excellent preclinical data, there are several potential barriers to translating hypothermia into clinical practice. Conclusion: Therapeutic hypothermia is a promising life-saving strategy. Appropriate patient selection requires a thorough understanding of how temperature modulation affects various biological mechanisms. Copyright ? 2011 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd.

AB  - Objectives Elevated shame and dissociation are common in dissociative identity disorder (DID) and chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and are part of the constellation of symptoms defined as complex PTSD. Previous work examined the relationship between shame, dissociation, and complex PTSD and whether they are associated with intimate relationship anxiety, relationship depression, and fear of relationships. This study investigated these variables in traumatized clinical samples and a nonclinical community group. Method Participants were drawn from the DID (n = 20), conflict-related chronic PTSD (n = 65), and nonclinical (n = 125) populations and completed questionnaires assessing the variables of interest. A model examining the direct impact of shame and dissociation on relationship functioning, and their indirect effect via complex PTSD symptoms, was tested through path analysis. Results The DID sample reported significantly higher dissociation, shame, complex PTSD symptom severity, relationship anxiety, relationship depression, and fear of relationships than the other two samples. Support was found for the proposed model, with shame directly affecting relationship anxiety and fear of relationships, and pathological dissociation directly affecting relationship anxiety and relationship depression. The indirect effect of shame and dissociation via complex PTSD symptom severity was evident on all relationship variables. Conclusion Shame and pathological dissociation are important for not only the effect they have on the development of other complex PTSD symptoms, but also their direct and indirect effects on distress associated with relationships.

AB  - Skin tests are important diagnostic tools. To establish reactivity, a single allergen test concentration is considered to be sufficient. To diagnose sensitivity serial dilution or endpoint titration is recommended. Skin testing in drug allergy is complex, since pathogenetic mechanisms are diverse, and for many drugs cut-off skin test concentrations have not been established. Therefore, after a negative prick/puncture test with the stock solution, intradermal tests with serial (ten-fold) dilutions are recommended. Surprisingly in most publications dealing with serial skin test dilution, the technique is not described in detail. Aim:? Comparison of the variability of test substance concentrations produced with two serial dilution techniques conducted by experienced allergy nurses. Methods:? Two allergy nurses produced dilution series. Isosulfane blue was chosen as test substance, since it enabled easy and sensitive detection. Dilution series of isosulfan blue (aqueous solution of 10?mg/ml) from 1:10 to 1:10?000 were produced under sterile conditions by two dilution techniques: 1) Dilution in vials: 0.5?ml isosulfane blue solution was serially transferred with 1?ml tuberculine syringes to vials containing exactly 4.5?ml NaCl 0.9% 2) Dilution in syringes: 0.1?ml isosulfane blue solution with the higher concentration was aspirated into 1?ml tuberculine syringes followed by 0.9?ml NaCl 0.9%. These procedures were compared with a controlled experiment carried out using piston-stroke pipettes. The concentrations of isosulfan blue in all dilutions were determined by UV/VIS-spectroscopy and external standard calibration. Results:? In almost all samples the concentrations were higher than expected. In vials the concentrations varied from 83 to 360%, in syringes from 83 to 711% of the expected values. The dilution in vials gave consistently better results than dilution in syringes. A considerable interindividual variability was observed between the conducting nurses, however variability over time was smaller. Conclusions:? In routinely performed serial dilutions of allergen test preparation considerable deviations from the expected allergen test concentration have been observed. This might be of minor importance for an individual patient, however, in establishing e.g. cut-off concentrations for non-irritant drug concentrations or in multicenter studies such variations may result in major errors. Quality management of skin testing should not only include the recording, injection technique and test reactivity evaluation, but also the exact description of the preparation of test dilutions. In clinical routine dilution techniques should be applied, which give more accurate results.

AB  - Abstract Adaptive behavior impairments have been reported in children with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) but are not typically found following mild TBI. It is possible that mild TBI induces subtle changes in adaptive functioning that are not captured in conventional group comparisons. This study aimed to explore time course changes in adaptive functioning following early mild TBI. Parents of 63 children with mild TBI and 53 children with orthopedic injuries aged between 1.5 and 5 years at the time of injury completed the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-II at three time points: retrospectively to assess pre-injury functioning, then at 6 and 18 months post-injury. Developmental trajectories of adaptive functioning domains (practical, conceptual, and social) reported by parents were modeled using linear mixed-model analyses. Findings suggest that mild TBI may disrupt the expected developmental progression of children's social adaptive behavior, but does not appear to alter practical and conceptual domains.

Well-being is measured as attainment in maths and reading, and on two behavioural assessments. Multivariate multi-level modelling allows for heterogeneity both within and between families. We find little to no association between moving home and children's well-being. Associations between family living arrangements and children's development appear to be mediated by human, financial and social capital, but not, on average, worsened by geographical mobility.

AB  - Background Few efficacious early treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children and adolescents exist. Previous trials have intervened within the first month post-trauma and focused on secondary prevention of later post-traumatic stress; however, considerable natural recovery may still occur up to 6-months post-trauma. No trials have addressed the early treatment of established PTSD (i.e. 2- to 6-months post-trauma). Methods Twenty-nine youth (8?17 years) with PTSD (according to age-appropriate DSM-IV or ICD-10 diagnostic criteria) after a single-event trauma in the previous 2?6 months were randomly allocated to Cognitive Therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD; n = 14) or waiting list (WL; n = 15) for 10 weeks. Results Significantly more participants were free of PTSD after CT-PTSD (71%) than WL (27%) at posttreatment (intent-to-treat, 95% CI for difference .04?.71). CT-PTSD yielded greater improvement on child-report questionnaire measures of PTSD, depression and anxiety; clinician-rated functioning; and parent-reported outcomes. Recovery after CT-PTSD was maintained at 6- and 12-month posttreatment. Beneficial effects of CT-PTSD were mediated through changes in appraisals and safety-seeking behaviours, as predicted by cognitive models of PTSD. CT-PTSD was considered acceptable on the basis of low dropout and high treatment credibility and therapist alliance ratings. Conclusions This trial provides preliminary support for the efficacy and acceptability of CT-PTSD as an early treatment for PTSD in youth. Moreover, the trial did not support the extension of ?watchful waiting? into the 2- to 6-month post-trauma window, as significant improvements in the WL arm (particularly in terms of functioning and depression) were not observed. Replication in larger samples is needed, but attention to recruitment issues will be required.

This article reviews parental reactions to nonconforming gender developments and poses that the parental mandates of protection and acceptance are problematized by the difference of gender norms between the child and the family, as well as the child and the environment. Through multiple therapeutic modalities?parental coaching and education, parent support group, and child and family therapy?the author illustrates interventions supporting both parents and prepubescent children in their negotiation of safety, connection, and fluidity. Case vignettes illustrate the method in action.

AB  - Highlights Fostering Healthy Futures (FHF) is a preventive intervention for preadolescent youth in foster care. 95% of those offered FHF started the program, 92% completed it, and there was over 85% attendance. FHF reduced mental health symptoms, especially trauma, and mental health service utilization. Effects were consistent across almost all subgroups, suggesting FHF benefits diverse children. Positive youth development programming is acceptable and can be beneficial for vulnerable children.

AB  - Summary Hellmut Hartert was the first person to exploit the viscoelastic properties of clotting blood to measure blood coagulation in 1948. Since then, the technology has improved, allowing these analyses to be performed as point-of-care tests with immediately-available results. The addition of several activators and inhibitors to the original assay creates a panel of tests able to quantify the different aspects of blood clotting that can rival conventional laboratory assays. However, although much progress has been made, the standardization and validation of these tests still need improvement. Viscoelastic analyses of blood coagulation are mainly used to guide haemostatic therapy in bleeding patients and have proven superior to standard clotting tests in some circumstances. There is potential to extend their use to other areas, such as drug monitoring, and diagnosis and management of congenital bleeding disorders. The forthcoming cartridge-based assays are expected to improve the reliability and usability of viscoelastic assays of blood coagulation but high quality clinical trials remain urgently needed to determine their exact place, benefit and cost effectiveness.

AB  - Abstract??? An evaluation of dental and maxillofacial trauma in a level 1 trauma center in Israel was carried out to assess the causes of trauma and the relationship between the injuries to the patient?s age, gender and ethnicity. Analysis was based on data from the Israel Trauma Registry. Patients hospitalized in a level 1 trauma center from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2005 were analyzed according to age, gender, time, place, ethnicity and cause of injury. Files of 22?558 trauma patients were reviewed. Maxillofacial and tooth injuries were separated and further analyzed according to the above parameters. Maxillofacial or dental injuries were observed in 1668 (7.4%) of the trauma patients, caused by motor vehicle accidents (39.2%), falls (30.9%), and intentional injuries (21.2%). Most occurred on the street/road (46.5%), at home (18.8%), and in public buildings (12.4%). Arab patients suffered more from vehicle accidents while Jewish patients presented more intentional injuries. Men were hospitalized three times more than women, and young people were at greater risk. The most frequent age of trauma was 19?28?years (27.6%). Ethnic differences were particularly noticeable for intentional injuries and vehicle accidents. This emphasizes that a larger percentage of the Arab population suffered from dental and maxillofacial injuries. Further dental health education and training for primary caregivers are warranted.

AB  - Abstract A natural history study was conducted in 142 Thalassemic (Thal), 199 transfused Sickle Cell Disease (Tx-SCD, n = 199), and 64 non-Tx-SCD subjects to describe the frequency of iron-related morbidity and mortality. Subjects recruited from 31 centers in the US, Canada or the UK were similar with respect to age (overall: 25 ± 11 years, mean ± SD) and gender (52% female). We found that Tx-SCD subjects were hospitalized more frequently compared with Thal or non-Tx-SCD (P < 0.001). Among those hospitalized, Tx-SCD adult subjects were more likely to be unemployed compared with Thal (RR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.0?2.5) or non-Tx-SCD (RR = 3.1, 95% CI 1.3?7.3). There was a positive relationship between the severity of iron overload, assessed by serum ferritin, and the frequency of hospitalizations (r= 0.20; P = 0.009). Twenty-three deaths were reported (6 Thal, 17 Tx-SCD) in 23.5 ± 10 months of follow-up. Within the Tx-SCD group, those who died began transfusion (25.3 vs. 12.4 years, P < 0.001) and chelation therapy later (26.8 vs. 14.2 years, P = 0.01) compared with those who survived. The unadjusted death rate in Thal was lower (2.2/100 person years) compared with that in Tx-SCD (7.0/100 person years; RR = 0.38: 95% CI 0.12?0.99). However, no difference was observed when age at death was considered. Despite improvements in therapy, death rate in this contemporary sample of transfused adult subjects with Thal or SCD is 3 times greater than the general US population. Long term follow-up of this unique cohort of subjects will be helpful in further defining the relationship of chronic, heavy iron overload to morbidity and mortality. Am. J.
