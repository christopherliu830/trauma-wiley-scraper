AB  - Abstract PSD-95 inhibitors have been shown to be neuroprotective in stroke, but have only to a very limited extent been evaluated in the treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that has pathophysiological mechanisms in common with stroke. The aims of the current study were to assess the effects of a novel dimeric inhibitor of PSD-95, UCCB01-147, on histopathology and long-term cognitive outcome after controlled cortical impact (CCI) in rats. As excitotoxic cell death is thought to be a prominent part of the pathophysiology of TBI, we also investigated the neuroprotective effects of UCCB01-147 and related compounds on NMDA-induced cell death in cultured cortical neurons. Anesthetized rats were given a CCI or sham injury, and were randomized to receive an injection of either UCCB01-147 (10 mg/kg), the non-competitive NMDAR-receptor antagonist MK-801 (1 mg/kg) or saline immediately after injury. At 2 and 4 weeks post-trauma, spatial learning and memory were assessed in a water maze, and at 3 months, brains were removed for estimation of lesion volumes. Overall, neither treatment with UCCB01-147 nor MK-801 resulted in significant improvements of cognition and histopathology after CCI. Although MK-801 provided robust neuroprotection against NMDA-induced toxicity in cultured cortical neurons, UCCB01-147 failed to reduce cell death and became neurotoxic at high doses. The data suggest potential differential effects of PSD-95 inhibition in stroke and TBI that should be investigated further in future studies taking important experimental factors such as timing of treatment, dosage, and anesthesia into consideration.

AB  - Abstract Objective.? Occipital neuralgia (ON) is a challenging condition for which there is no reference standard for treatment. The purpose of this study was to provide outcome data on the largest study to date evaluating pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) for ON and to determine whether any demographic, clinical, or treatment characteristics are associated with success. Design.? Retrospective data analysis was conducted in 102 subjects evaluating the effect of myriad factors on treatment success. Setting.? This study was conducted in academic civilian and military pain treatment centers. Patients.? One hundred and two consecutive patients with a primary diagnosis of ON were treated with PRF of the greater and/or lesser occipital nerve. Outcome Measures.? A positive primary outcome was predefined as ≥50% pain relief lasting at least 3 months. The secondary outcome measure was procedural satisfaction. Results.? Fifty-two (51%) patients experienced ≥50% pain relief and satisfaction with treatment lasting at least 3 months. Variables associated with a positive outcome included a traumatic inciting event (65.7% success rate; P?=?0.03), lower diagnostic block volumes (odds ratio [OR]: 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62?0.82; P?<?0.0001), and employment of multiple rounds of PRF (OR: 2.95; 95% CI: 1.77?4.92; P?<?0.0001). Factors correlating with treatment failure included extension of pain anterior to the scalp apex (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.14?0.73; P?=?0.006) and ongoing secondary gain issues (OR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.11?0.33; P?<?0.0001). Conclusion.? PRF may provide intermediate-term benefit in ON to a significant proportion of refractory cases. Careful attention to selection criteria and treatment parameters may further improve treatment outcomes.

AB  - Abstract The aim of the study was to determine the effectiveness of the recently developed Eye Movement Desensitization (EMD) procedure on traumatic memory symptomatology. Twenty-two subjects suffering from symptoms related to traumatic memories were used in the study. All had been victims of traumatic incidents concerning the Vietnam War, childhood sexual molestation, sexual or physical assault, or emotional abuse. Memories of the traumatic incident were pivotal to the presenting complaints which included intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, sleep disturbances, low self-esteem, and relationship problems. Dependent variables were (1) anxiety level, (2) validity of a positive self-statement/assessment of the traumatic incident, and (3) presenting complaints. These measures were obtained at the initial session and at 1- and 3-month follow-up sessions. The results of the study indicated that a single session of the EMD procedure successfully desensitized the subjects' traumatic memories and dramatically altered their cognitive assessments of the situation, effects that were maintained through the 3-month follow-up check. This therapeutic benefit was accompanied by behavioral shifts which included the alleviation of the subjects' primary presenting complaints.

AB  - Abstract Objectives One of the hallmarks of contemporary osteoporosis and bone loss is dramatically higher prevalence of loss and fragility in females post-menopause. In contrast, bioarchaeological studies of bone loss have found a greater diversity of age- and sex-related patterns of bone loss in past populations. We argue that the differing findings may relate to the fact that most studies use only a single methodology to quantify bone loss and do not account for the heterogeneity and complexity of bone maintenance across the skeleton and over the life course. Methods We test the hypothesis that bone mass and maintenance in trabecular bone sites versus cortical bone sites will show differing patterns of age-related bone loss, with cortical bone sites showing sex difference in bone loss that are similar to contemporary Western populations, and trabecular bone loss at earlier ages. We investigated this hypothesis in the Imperial Roman population of Velia using three methods: radiogrammetry of the second metacarpal (N?=?71), bone histology of ribs (N?=?70), and computerized tomography of trabecular bone architecture (N?=?47). All three methods were used to explore sex and age differences in patterns of bone loss. Results The suite of methods utilized reveal differences in the timing of bone loss with age, but all methods found no statistically significant differences in age-related bone loss. Discussion We argue that a multi-method approach reduces the influence of confounding factors by building a reconstruction of bone turnover over the life cycle that a limited single-method project cannot provide. The implications of using multiple methods beyond studies of bone loss are also discussed.

AB  - Abstract ? This study aimed to assess the prevalence of injuries to the permanent incisors in Blumenau, Brazil. In addition, the relationship between dental injuries and socio-economic indicators was examined. A cross-sectional survey was carried out. It included a random sample of 652 children aged 12 years, from both sexes, attending public and private primary schools in Blumenau, Brazil. Multi-stage sampling technique and proportional representation were adopted. A trained and calibrated dentist collected the data through clinical examinations and interviews. Clinical examination included type of damage, treatment provided and needed, size of incisal overjet and type of lip coverage. The response rate was 82.5%. The prevalence of dental injuries was 58.6%. Boys experienced more injuries than girls, 67.2% and 50.2% (P=0.001), respectively. Children from mothers with higher schooling experienced more dental injuries than those from of mothers with lower schooling, 68.2% and 56.6% (P=0.03). Father?s level of education, parents? employment status and family income were not statistically significantly associated with dental injuries (P>0.05). There was a tendency for children with incisal overjet greater than 5 mm (P=0.2) and inadequate lip coverage (P=0.1) to have more dental injuries, but differences were not statistically significant. Nearly all (97.3%) children who had dental injuries needed treatment. In conclusion, the prevalence of dental injuries in Blumenau, Brazil, was very high, treatment of dental injuries was severely neglected, and boys and children from mothers with high schooling were more likely to have experienced dental injuries.

AB  - Abstract Facilitated attention toward angry stimuli (attention bias) may contribute to anger proneness and temper outbursts exhibited by children with high irritability. However, most studies linking attention bias and irritability rely on behavioral measures with limited precision and no studies have explored these associations in young children. The present study explores irritability-related attention biases toward anger in young children (N = 128; ages 4?7 years) engaged in a dot-probe task with emotional faces, as assessed with event-related brain potential (ERP) indices of early selective attention and multi-method assessment of irritability. Irritability assessed via semi-structured clinical interview predicted larger anterior N1 amplitudes to all faces. In contrast, irritability assessed via a laboratory observation paradigm predicted reduced P1 amplitudes to angry relative to neutral faces. These findings suggest that altered early attentional processing occurs in young children with high irritability; however, the nature of these patterns may vary with methodological features of the irritability assessments. Future investigations using different assessment tools may provide greater clarity regarding the underlying neurocognitive correlates of irritability. Such studies may also contribute to the ongoing debates about how to best define and measure irritability across the developmental spectrum in a manner that is most informative for linkage to neural processes.

AB  - Abstract Importance The transscleral XEN Glaucoma Gel Microstent (XEN-GGM, Allergan Plc., Parsippany, New Jersey) is implanted by a minimally invasive ab interno technique. Background The present study aims to assess the long-term clinical outcomes in patients after XEN-GGM implantation. Design This prospective, non-randomized, multi-centred study was conducted in three countries (Austria, Canada and Germany). Participants Sixty-four consecutive eyes of 64 patients with open angle glaucoma received the XEN-GGM (63 ?m) without Mitomycin C. Thirty-five (55%) were solo procedures, and 29 (45%) were combined with cataract surgery. Methods Visits were planned at baseline, 6 months, 1, 2, 3 and 4 years postoperatively. Main Outcome Measures The main outcome measures were mean intraocular pressure (IOP), mean number of IOP lowering medication. Secondary outcome parameters were: visual acuity, visual fields and complete surgical failure (defined as presence of a secondary IOP lowering procedure or loss of light perception) at 4 years, postoperatively. Results Mean best-medicated baseline IOP was 22.5 ± 4.2 mmHg and decreased significantly to 13.4 ± 3.1 mmHg 4 years postoperatively (?40%, n = 34, P < 0.001). Mean number of IOP lowering medication decreased significantly from 2.4 ± 1.3 preoperatively to 1.2 ± 1.3 (?50%, n = 34, P < 0.001) postoperatively. Visual field mean deviation showed no significant change between preoperative and postoperative examinations. Complete surgical failure rate per year was 10%. Conclusions and Relevance The XEN-GGM resulted in lower IOP and a reduction in medications from baseline over 4 years of follow-up. There was no detectable decrease in visual fields over the study. The surgical failure rate is comparable to other filtration surgeries.

AB  - Abstract Mouse spinal cord (SC) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) provides important information on tissue morphology and structural changes that may occur during pathologies such as multiple sclerosis or SC injury. The acquisition scheme of the commonly used DWI techniques is based on conventional spin-echo encoding, which is time-consuming. The purpose of this work was to investigate whether the use of echo planar imaging (EPI) would provide good-quality diffusion MR images of mouse SC, as well as accurate measurements of diffusion-derived metrics, and thus enable diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and highly resolved DWI within reasonable scan times. A four-shot diffusion-weighted spin-echo EPI (SE-EPI) sequence was evaluated at 11.75?T on a group of healthy mice (n?=?10). SE-EPI-derived apparent diffusion coefficients of gray and white matter were compared with those obtained using a conventional spin-echo sequence (c-SE) to validate the accuracy of the method. To take advantage of the reduction in acquisition time offered by the EPI sequence, multi-slice DTI acquisitions were performed covering the cervical segments (six slices, six diffusion-encoding directions, three b values) within 30?min (vs 2?h for c-SE). From these measurements, fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivities were calculated, and fiber tracking along the C1 to C6 cervical segments was performed. In addition, high-resolution images (74???94?µm2) were acquired within 5?min per direction. Clear delineation of gray and white matter and identical apparent diffusion coefficient values were obtained, with a threefold reduction in acquisition time compared with c-SE. While overcoming the difficulties associated with high spatially and temporally resolved DTI measurements, the present SE-EPI approach permitted identification of reliable quantitative parameters with a reproducibility compatible with the detection of pathologies. The SE-EPI method may be particularly valuable when multiple sets of images from the SC are needed, in cases of rapidly evolving conditions, to decrease the duration of anesthesia or to improve MR exploration by including additional MR measurements.

AB  - Abstract The NIH project ?Inflammatory and Host Response to Injury? (Glue) is being conducted to study the changes in the body over time in response to trauma and burn. Patients are monitored for changes in their clinical status, such as the onset of and recovery from organ failure. Blood samples are drawn over the first days and weeks after the injury to obtain gene expression levels over time. Our goal was to develop a method of selecting genes that differentially expressed in patients who either improved or experienced organ failure. For this, we needed a test for the association between longitudinal gene expressions and the time to the occurrence of ordered categorical outcomes indicating recovery, stable disease, and organ failure. We propose a test for which the relationship between the gene expression and the events is modeled using the cumulative proportional odds model that is a generalization of the pooling repeated observation method. Given the high-dimensionality of the microarray data, it was necessary to control for the multiplicity of the testing. To control for the false discovery rate (FDR), we applied both a permutational approach as well as Efron's empirical estimation method. We explore our method through simulations and provide the analysis of the multi-center, longitudinal study of immune response to inflammation and trauma (http://www.gluegrant.org).

AB  - Objectives: To compare the volume of in-stent neointimal proliferation, assessed by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), at 6-month follow-up after implantation of a coronary Carbofilm?-coated stent (Tecnic Carbostent?, Sorin Biomedica Cardio, Saluggia, Italy) versus a conventional 316 L stent (Rx Multi-Link Penta, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). Background: Many trials suggest that stent characteristics and coating could be important determinants of restenosis. Methods: From October 2004 to May 2005, 63 patients were randomized to Tecnic (T, n = 30) or Penta (P, n = 33). The primary end-point was in-stent volume of neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) measured by IVUS at 6 months. The secondary end-points included binary restenosis, minimal luminal diameter (MLD), target lesion revascularization, and major adverse cardiac events. Results: There were no significant differences between T and P as to mean age, male gender, clinical status, complexity of the lesion, lesion length, reference vessel diameter before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), MLD pre-PCI, and stent-to-artery ratio. However, MLD poststenting was greater in P group than T group (2.81 ± 0.45 mm vs. 2.49 ± 0.33 mm, P < 0.002). At 6 months, angiographic late lumen loss (0.61 ± 0.51 mm vs. 0.92 ± 0.61 mm, P < 0.043), in-stent obstruction (25.86 ± 16.48% vs. 38.33 ± 19.56%, P = 0.021), and in-stent late loss volume (31.62 ± 29.75 mm3 vs. 57.28 ± 37.16 mm3, P = 0.016) were significantly lower in T group than in P group. Conclusion: Penta stent appears to offer a better deployment and a larger MLD post-PCI than Carbofilm-coated stent. However, a thicker NIH was observed on Penta stent at 6-month follow-up, when compared to Tecnic.

AB  - Abstract Background The purpose of this study was to characterize hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated differences in the expression of 47 inflammatory factors and to evaluate the potential role of peripheral immune activation in HCV-associated neuropsychiatric symptoms?depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain. An additional objective was to evaluate the role of immune factor dysregulation in the expression of specific neuropsychiatric symptoms to identify biomarkers that may be relevant to the treatment of these neuropsychiatric symptoms in adults with or without HCV. Methods Blood samples and neuropsychiatric symptom severity scales were collected from HCV-infected adults (HCV+, n = 39) and demographically similar noninfected controls (HCV?, n = 40). Multi-analyte profile analysis was used to evaluate plasma biomarkers. Results Compared with HCV? controls, HCV+ adults reported significantly (P < 0.050) greater depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain, and they were more likely to present with an increased inflammatory profile as indicated by significantly higher plasma levels of 40% (19/47) of the factors assessed (21%, after correcting for multiple comparisons). Within the HCV+ group, but not within the HCV? group, an increased inflammatory profile (indicated by the number of immune factors > the LDC) significantly correlated with depression, anxiety, and pain. Within the total sample, neuropsychiatric symptom severity was significantly predicted by protein signatures consisting of 4?10 plasma immune factors; protein signatures significantly accounted for 19?40% of the variance in depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain. Conclusions Overall, the results demonstrate that altered expression of a network of plasma immune factors contributes to neuropsychiatric symptom severity. These findings offer new biomarkers to potentially facilitate pharmacotherapeutic development and to increase our understanding of the molecular pathways associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in adults with or without HCV.

AB  - An imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine productions in adipose tissue is thought to contribute to chronic, systemic, low-grade inflammation and consequently to an increased risk of cardiovascular complications in obese and type 2 diabetic patients. Nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), whose serum levels are elevated in such patients, have been shown to interfere with cytokine production in vitro. In order to evaluate the effects of elevated NEFA levels on cytokine production in adipose tissue in vivo we used an 18-gauge open-flow microperfusion (OFM) catheter to induce local inflammation in the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of healthy volunteers and to sample interstitial fluid (IF) specifically from the inflamed tissue. In two crossover studies, nine subjects received either an intravenous lipid-heparin infusion to elevate circulating NEFA levels or saline over a period of 28 h. The former increased the circulating levels of triglycerides (TGs), NEFA, glucose, and insulin over the study period. NEFA effects on locally induced inflammation were estimated by measuring the levels of a panel adipokines in the OFM probe effluent. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels increased during the study period but were not affected by lipid-heparin infusion. In contrast, the level of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was significantly reduced during the final hour of lipid-heparin infusion (saline: 449.2 ± 105.9 vs. lipid-heparin: 65.4 ± 15.4 pg/ml; P = 0.02). These data provide the first in vivo evidence that elevated NEFA can modulate cytokine production by adipose tissue.

AB  - An improved understanding and characterization of glial activation and its relationship with white matter injury will likely serve as a novel treatment target to curb post injury inflammation and promote axonal remyelination after brain trauma. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant public healthcare burden and a leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Particularly, traumatic white matter (WM) injury or traumatic axonal injury has been reported as being associated with patients' poor outcomes. However, there is very limited data reporting the importance of glial activation after TBI and its interaction with WM injury. This article presents a systematic review of traumatic WM injury and the associated glial activation, from basic science to clinical diagnosis and prognosis, from advanced neuroimaging perspective. It concludes that there is a disconnection between WM injury research and the essential role of glia which serve to restore a healthy environment for axonal regeneration following WM injury. Particularly, there is a significant lack of non-invasive means to characterize the complex pathophysiology of WM injury and glial activation in both animal models and in humans. An improved understanding and characterization of the relationship between glia and WM injury will likely serve as a novel treatment target to curb post injury inflammation and promote axonal remyelination.

AB  - In recent years, the local lymph node assay (LLNA) has emerged as a practical option for assessing the skin sensitization potential of chemicals. In addition to accurate identification of skin sensitizers, the LLNA can also provide a reliable measure of relative sensitization potency; information that is pivotal in successful management of human health risks. However, even with the significant animal welfare benefits provided by the LLNA, there is interest still in the development of non-animal test methods for skin sensitization. Here, we have collected a large dataset of chemicals that have been tested in the LLNA, and the activity of which correspond with what is known of their potential to cause skin sensitization in humans. It is anticipated that this will be of value to other investigators in the evaluation and calibration of novel approaches to skin sensitization testing, in particular for the development of in silico methods. Prerequisite for the development of in silico models is always the availability of a large high quality data set, suitable for modeling. This dataset encompasses both the chemical and biological diversity of known chemical allergens, and provides also examples of negative controls. The data are a collection of published and non-proprietary industry data. All materials were tested in standard vehicules following the standard LLNA protocol. It is hoped that this dataset will accelerate the development, evaluation and eventual validation of new approaches to skin sensitization testing.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare demographics and disease characteristics in dogs in which peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia (PPDH) had been diagnosed and report outcomes after surgical treatment (ST) or conservative treatment (CT). Study design Retrospective study. Sample population One hundred twenty-eight dogs (91 ST, 37 CT) in which PPDH had been diagnosed. Methods Medical records were reviewed for demographics, perioperative findings, and outcomes. Follow-up was obtained via telephone interview and email correspondence with owners and referring veterinarians. Baseline variables were compared between treatment groups. Results Dogs treated surgically were younger (P < .001), more likely to be sexually intact (P = .002), more likely to have clinical signs from PPDH vs an incidental diagnosis (P < .001), and more likely to have other congenital abnormalities (P = .003) compared with dogs treated conservatively. Ninety-seven percent of ST dogs were discharged from hospitals. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were reported in 22% and 41% of dogs, respectively, although most complications were classified as low grade (75% and 83%, respectively). Follow-up was available in 87 dogs, at a median of 1062?days. Hernia recurrence was not reported in any surgically treated dog. The deaths of nine dogs (five ST, four CT) could be attributed to PPDH, and long median survival times were observed in both the ST and CT groups (8.2 and 5?years, respectively). Conclusion Preoperative characteristics differed between dogs treated conservatively vs surgically. Surgical treatment was associated with low operative mortality, and both ST and CT dogs had good long-term survival. Clinical significance A diagnosis of PPDH can confer a good long-term prognosis for both ST and CT dogs.

AB  - Patch testing with materials brought in by the patient is useful to identify the cause(s) of current allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). However, little is known (i) on the contribution of such tests to diagnostic success and (ii) on the spectrum of contact allergens associated with ACD to certain product categories. Between 1998 and 2002, 5911 out of 48381 patients patch tested in the centres of the IVDK (http://www.ivdk.org) have been tested with own cosmetics and toiletries in addition to commercial allergens. These were manually assigned to 26 categories, based on a EU classification (annex I to 76/768/EEC), which was further refined. As illustrative example, data on ?Bath and shower preparations? are presented: out of 1333 patients tested with a total of 2336 single patches (1102 with 1%, 391 with 10% and 280 with 0.1% in water, remainder with other preparations, depending on the actual kind of product), 71 had positive reactions at the D3 reading. Only in 46 of these, reactions to potential cosmetic ingredients, tested as commercially available allergens, were observed. Among these, fragrance mix (30.0% vs. 12.9% in those not reacting positively to this product category), Myroxylon Pereirae resin (18.6% vs. 8.4%) and some biocides like MCI/MI (11.4% vs. 1.8%) and methyldibromo glutaronitrile?+?phenoxyethanol (12.1% vs. 5.3%) were the most common allergens. In conclusion, patch testing own products ? although not without pitfalls ? may (i) help to correctly diagnose ACD and (ii) give important hints on the occurrence of allergens in a particular type of (cosmetic) product.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Over the past decade, the human identity testing community has settled on a set of core short tandem repeat (STR) loci that are widely used for DNA typing applications. A variety of commercial kits enable robust amplification of these core STR loci. A brief history is presented regarding the selection of core autosomal and Y-chromosomal STR markers. The physical location of each STR locus in the human genome is delineated and allele ranges and variants observed in human populations are summarized as are mutation rates observed from parentage testing. Internet resources for additional information on core STR loci are reviewed. Additional topics are also discussed, including potential linkage of STR loci to genetic disease-causing genes, probabilistic predictions of sample ethnicity, and desirable characteristics for additional STR loci that may be added in the future to the current core loci. These core STR loci, which form the basis for DNA databases worldwide, will continue to play an important role in forensic science for many years to come.

AB  - Abstract An increasing number of suicide attempts involve the ingestion of glyphosate surfactant; hence, clinical toxicologists may encounter severe cases of glyphosate surfactant intoxication. In several other clinical conditions, serum lactate is used to predict outcome. We investigated the relationship between lactate levels and 30-day mortality from glyphosate surfactant poisoning. This retrospective analysis involved 232 patients who were admitted to the emergency department after acute glyphosate surfactant poisoning between January 2004 and June 2014. We used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to define the optimal cut-off point for lactate levels. A Kaplan?Meier 30-day survival curve was then analysed in terms of the defined cut-off level. We used multi-variate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to determine the risk factors for 30-day mortality. Of the 232 patients, 29 died, yielding a case fatality rate of 12.5%. Lactate was significantly higher in non-survivors (6.5 ± 3.1 mmol/L) than in survivors (3.3 ± 2.2 mmol/L; p < 0.001), and elevated lactate was significantly associated with 30-day mortality. The area under the ROC curve of lactate levels was 0.836 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.716?0.869]. Lactate levels higher than 4.7 mmol/L were associated with increased mortality in multi-variable analysis (hazard ratio: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.1?8.7). Besides lactate, age >59 years, corrected QT interval >495 ms and potassium >5.5 mmol/L were independent risk factors for 30-day mortality. Lactate is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality in patients with glyphosate surfactant poisoning. Early measurement of lactate levels may be a simple and practical way to assess the severity of intoxication.
