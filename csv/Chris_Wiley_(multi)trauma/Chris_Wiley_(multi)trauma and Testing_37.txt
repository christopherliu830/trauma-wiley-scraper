AB  - Background In this study, we evaluated the clinical efficacy of a biodegradable nerve conduit constructed of polyglycolic acid (PGA) tube with external and internal collagen scaffolding for digital nerve repair. Patients and methods A multi-center registry study was conducted in 11 locations between July 2013 and May 2016. Multiple mechanisms of injury included clean-cut (12 patients), crush (5 patients), and avulsion (3 patients) types of injuries. These patients underwent nerve repair with a biodegradable nerve conduit, with 9 patients having a primary repair and 11 patients having delayed repair. Average nerve gap was 16.7 mm (range: 1?50?mm). An average of 13?months follow-up (range: 12?15?months) was available including sensory assessments. Results Improved s2PD was found with less severe injury as in clean-cut (7.5?±?1.5 mm), which was statistically significant in comparison to those in crush (9.8?±?1.9 mm, P?=?.0384) and in avulsion (10.7?±?4.7 mm, P?=?.0013) type injuries. A meaningful recovery (S3+ or S4) was observed in 90% of the 20 digital nerve repairs with a biodegradable nerve conduit of PGA with external and internal collagen scaffolding. Avulsion injuries had significantly lower levels of meaningful recovery (67%) in comparison to those of clean-cut (P?=?.0291) and crush (P?=?.0486) types of injury. No adverse effects were reported postoperatively. Conclusion These results indicate that a biodegradable nerve conduit of PGA with external and internal collagen scaffolding is suitable for digital nerve repair of short nerve gaps with high levels of sensory recovery as measured by two-point discrimination.

AB  - The discrepancy between current and premorbid ability is a relevant indicator of acquired mental impairment, which itself is closely related to general cerebral dysfunction. The use of tests sensitive to cerebral dysfunction, raises relatively few problems compared with tests being resistent that are used to estimate premorbid mental ability. For premorbid ability, verbal tests assessing knowledge, especially vocabulary, have been shown to be valid. A test, possibly more insensitive to brain dysfunction than the ones usually administered, is the multiple choice vocabulary test (MWT = Mehrfachwahl-Wortschatz-Test). At present only German versions are available. They are presented in some detail because of their advantages. Construction of the MWT is simple, and it can be easily administered in about five minutes. The results correlate fairly well with global IQ in healthy adults (median of r = 0.72 in 22 samples) and are more insensitive to current disturbances than such tests as the WAIS vocabulary test. The limitations of premorbid tests with respect to diagnostic validity are discussed. It is concluded, that studies which do not control premorbid intelligence have to be considered as a ?malpractice? and should not be accepted by scientists.

AB  - Abstract Background: Psychosis can be considered one of the most severe stressors that an individual may face. Previous studies have suggested that the traumatic experience of psychotic symptoms and hospitalization may provoke a post-traumatic type reaction. Aim: The aim of this study was to establish the point prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among patients recovering from a first-episode of psychosis in Singapore, and to elucidate the factors associated with it. Methods: Patients from the Early Psychosis Intervention Programme in Singapore, who were recovering from their first psychotic episode, participated in this study. Diagnoses were made using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) ? Text Revised Axis I Disorders. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, an interviewer-rated semi-structured interview, was used to diagnose PTSD. Results: Sixty-one patients (30 males, 31 females) were recruited. Twelve (19.7%) patients were diagnosed with PTSD. Hospitalization for treatment, whether compulsory or otherwise, did not increase the rate of PTSD. The Chinese ethnic group had lower risk of developing PTSD (adjusted odds ratio 0.14, P?=?0.018). Conclusions: There was a high prevalence of PTSD in patients recovering from their first psychotic episode. This study raises awareness among clinicians and hopes to promote early recognition and treatment of PTSD so as to potentially improve outcome.

AB  - Objective. Little is known about socio-demographic, diagnostic, and clinical characteristics of patients referred for assessment to psychodynamic psychotherapy services. The aim of this study was to remedy this by prospectively collecting comprehensive and systematic demographic and clinical information on a large number of patients referred to NHS psychodynamic psychotherapy services. Design. Fourteen psychotherapy services operating within a National Health Service joined the study and contributed data for 1,136 patients referred from primary and secondary care clinics. Method. Patients were assessed using questionnaires and self-rated measures, which included the clinician-based version of the diagnostic form of the Millon clinical multi-axial inventory-III-revised edition (MCMI-III-R), the brief symptom inventory (BSI), the inventory of interpersonal problems (IIP), and the clinical outcome in routine evaluation (CORE). The pathway from assessment through to treatment and variables associated with treatment uptake and exclusion are described and examined. Results. Most patients were in the moderate to severe range of psychiatric severity at the time of presentation. Ninety-five percent met clinically based criteria for a psychiatric disorder (mostly anxiety and mood disorders) and/or personality disorder. Although the majority of patients were found suitable for treatment (N=935, 82%), analysis of uptake showed relatively high rates of treatment rejection by patients and treatment drop-out. Partial outcome data at 6-month follow-up after intake into treatment revealed significant change but modest effect size (d=0.35). Conclusion. Systematic collection of baseline and outcome data would provide a national database of the performance of psychotherapy services that would be invaluable in facilitating comparative studies.

AB  - Abstract Advanced therapies such as bioengineered skin substitutes (BSS) and dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (dHACM) have been shown to promote healing of chronic diabetic ulcers. An interim analysis of data from 60 patients enrolled in a prospective, randomised, controlled, parallel group, multi-centre clinical trial showed that dHACM (EpiFix?, MiMedx Group Inc., Marietta, GA) is superior to standard wound care (SWC) and BSS (Apligraf?, Organogenesis, Inc., Canton, MA) in achieving complete wound closure within 4?6 weeks. Rates and time to closure at a longer time interval and factors influencing outcomes remained unassessed; therefore, the study was continued in order to achieve at least 100 patients. With the larger cohort, we compare clinical outcomes at 12 weeks in 100 patients with chronic lower extremity diabetic ulcers treated with weekly applications of Apligraf (n = 33), EpiFix (n = 32) or SWC (n = 35) with collagen-alginate dressing as controls. A Cox regression was performed to analyse the time to heal within 12 weeks, adjusting for all significant covariates. A Kaplan?Meier analysis was conducted to compare time-to-heal within 12 weeks for the three treatment groups. Clinical characteristics were well matched across study groups. The proportion of wounds achieving complete closure within the 12-week study period were 73% (24/33), 97% (31/32), and 51% (18/35) for Apligraf, EpiFix and SWC, respectively (adjusted P = 0·00019). Subjects treated with EpiFix had a very significant higher probability of their wounds healing [hazard ratio (HR: 5·66; adjusted P: 1·3 x 10?7] compared to SWC alone. No difference in probability of healing was observed for the Apligraf and SWC groups. Patients treated with Apligraf were less likely to heal than those treated with EpiFix [HR: 0·30; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0·17?0·54; unadjusted P: 5·8 x 10?5]. Increased wound size and presence of hypertension were significant factors that influenced healing. Mean time-to-heal within 12 weeks was 47·9 days (95% CI: 38·2?57·7) with Apligraf, 23·6 days (95% CI: 17·0?30·2) with EpiFix group and 57·4 days (95%CI: 48·2?66·6) with the SWC alone group (adjusted P = 3·2 x 10?7). Median number of grafts used per healed wound were six (range 1?13) and 2·5 (range 1?12) for the Apligraf and EpiFix groups, respectively. Median graft cost was $8918 (range $1,486?19,323) per healed wound for the Apligraf group and $1,517 (range $434?25,710) per healed wound in the EpiFix group (P?<?0·0001). These results provide further evidence of the clinical and resource utilisation superiority of EpiFix compared to Apligraf for the treatment of lower extremity diabetic wounds.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis To describe postoperative adverse events (AEs) and outcomes after transoral surgery for bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP). Study Design Prospective observational multicenter study. Methods Thirty-six patients with BVFP underwent transoral surgery using standard surgical procedures to unilaterally widen the glottic area. Postoperative adverse events (AEs) including severe adverse events (SAEs) were registered continuously. Pre- and 6-month postoperative evaluations included the 6-Minute Walk Test, the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Glasgow Benefit Inventory, the 12-Item Voice Handicap Index (VHI-12), and a Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing graded according to the Penetration?Aspiration-Scale. Results The patients underwent posterior cordotomy, partial arytenoidectomy, or permanent laterofixation as single procedures or in combination. Forty-seven percent of the patients had postoperative AEs. Dyspnea was the most frequent AE (45%). In 40% of AEs, the events were severe (SAEs), and 72.5% were related to the study intervention. Revision surgery leading to prolonged hospitalization or rehospitalization was necessary in nine cases (25%). Laterofixation was correlated to a decreased risk of AEs (P?=?0.042). Six months after surgery, a significant improvement was seen in the SF-domains: Physical component score (P?=?0.008), physical functioning (P?=?0.001), physical role (P?=?0.031), and vitality (P?=?0.032). Concerning the voice handicap, only the VHI-12 physical subscore showed a decrease (P?=?0.005). The total score and other VHI-12 subscores did not change significantly (all P?>?0.05). Conclusion BCVP patients profit from modern transoral surgery for unilateral glottic widening; quality of life is improved; and the voice is preserved. Nevertheless, postoperative complications are frequent. Level of Evidence 2b. Laryngoscope, 125:1401?1408, 2015

AB  - Abstract The allotransplantation of vascularized femoral diaphyses and total knee joints is a novel approach in orthopedic surgery. Allogeneic femoral diaphyses were transplanted into three patients suffering from chondrosarcoma or posttraumatic defects. Total knee joints allografts were transplanted in five patients with large bone defects of the knee and loss of the extensor apparatus caused either by major trauma alone or infection after a major trauma. Bone segments and total joints were harvested from multi-organ donors, perfused with UW-solution and transplanted within cold ischemia times of 18?25 h. Patients were immunosuppressed postoperatively primarily with cyclosporine (Cyclosporin A) and azathioprine. Two allografts (1 femur, 1 knee) were lost due to infections. Seven of the eight patients are able to walk with full weight-bearing posttransplant. Two of the patients with transplanted joint allografts subsequently received total knee arthroplasty implantations. Vascularized bone and joint allotransplantation may serve as a last line of defense treatment before considering lower limb amputation. ? 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Microsurgery 20:375?383 2000

AB  - (Headache 2011;51:945-953) Objective.? The current study used a cross-sectional observational design to evaluate the relationship between psychological, physiological, and contextual factors and headache severity among 133 deployed military personnel and 4 civilian contractors diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) referred to a combat support hospital in Iraq. Background.? Although TBI and headache sequelae have been documented for military combatants, little is known about factors associated with headache severity. Methods.? Military personnel (n?=?157) and civilian (n?=?4) contractors referred to a combat support hospital in Iraq underwent a standardized intake evaluation which included computerized neurocognitive testing, psychological and physical health questionnaires, a clinical interview, and a physical examination by a physician. Results.? Results of zero-inflated Poisson regression modeling suggest that insomnia is associated with increased likelihood for endorsement of any headache, but loss of consciousness, post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, and slowed reaction time only are predictive of headache severity. Among the subset of patients presenting to the combat support hospital within 7 days of mTBI (n?=?101), number of TBI symptoms demonstrated a non-significant trend toward increased likelihood of headache endorsement of any kind, with loss of consciousness, post-traumatic stress disorder, and slowed reaction time demonstrating significant relationships with headache severity. Conclusion.? Knowledge of predictors of post-concussive headache onset and severity may assist clinicians in making important decisions regarding treatment recommendations for veterans with mTBI.

AB  - Objective The identification of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among natural disaster survivors is remarkably challenging, and there are no reliable objective signatures that can be used to assist clinical diagnosis and optimize treatment. The current study aimed to establish a neurobiological signature of PTSD from the connectivity of large-scale brain networks and clarify the brain network mechanisms of PTSD. Methods We examined fifty-seven unmedicated survivors with chronic PTSD and 59 matched trauma-exposed healthy controls (TEHCs) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). We extracted the node-to-network connectivity and obtained a feature vector with a dimensionality of 864 (108 nodes ? 8 networks) to represent each subject?s functional connectivity (FC) profile. Multivariate pattern analysis with a relevance vector machine was then used to distinguish PTSD patients from TEHCs. Results We achieved a promising diagnostic accuracy of 89.2% in distinguishing PTSD patients from TEHCs. The most heavily weighted connections for PTSD classification were among the default mode network (DMN), visual network (VIS), somatomotor network, limbic network, and dorsal attention network (DAN). The strength of the anticorrelation of FC between the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) in DMN and the VIS and DAN was associated with the severity of PTSD. Conclusions This study achieved relatively high accuracy in classifying PTSD patients vs. TEHCs at the individual level. This performance demonstrates that rs-fMRI-derived multivariate classification based on large-scale brain networks can provide potential signatures both to facilitate clinical diagnosis and to clarify the underlying brain network mechanisms of PTSD caused by natural disasters.

AB  - Abstract Aims This multi-centre prospective field study evaluated whether peripheral venous catheter site of insertion influences the risk of catheter-related phlebitis. Potential predictors of phlebitis were also investigated. Background Millions of patients worldwide use peripheral venous catheters, which frequently cause local complications including phlebitis, infection and obstruction. Although phlebitis predictors have been broadly investigated, uncertainties remain on the potential effect of cannulation anatomical site, duration and the appropriate time for catheter removal. Design A prospective cohort design was carried out from January?June 2012. Methods The clinical course of each patient who received a new peripheral venous catheter for any cause in five Italian hospitals was followed by trained nurses until catheter removal. The presence of phlebitis was assessed every 24 hours using the Visual Infusion Phlebitis score. Analyses were based upon multilevel mixed-effects regression. Results The final sample consisted of 1498 patients. The average time for catheters in situ was 65·6 hours and 23·6% of the catheters were in place beyond 96 hours. Overall phlebitis incidence was 15·4%, 94·4% of which were grade 1. The likelihood of phlebitis independently increased with increasing catheter duration, being highest after 96 hours. Compared with patients with catheter placed in the dorsum of the hand (22·8% of the sample), those with the catheter located in the antecubital fossa (34·1%) or forearm were less likely to have a phlebitis of any grade. Conclusions Antecubital fossa and forearm veins may be preferential sites for peripheral venous cannulation. Our results support Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations to replace catheters in adults no later than 96 hours. A relevant proportion of healthcare personnel did not adhere to such guidelines ? more attention to this issue is required.

AB  - Two groups of children, one able-bodied and the other with physical disabilities, explored a symmetrical three-tiered virtual building that contained six distinctive target objects, two on each storey. In a subsequent test, the target objects were removed and participants were asked to make judgments of the directions to the former target locations from each floor in turn. At each test site, judgments were required for targets that were formerly on the same floor and for those on higher and lower floors. Relative tilt error scores suggested a bias for both groups, in that targets that were higher than the test location were judged as consistently lower than their actual position, whereas targets that were lower than the test location were judged as higher than their actual position. Absolute tilt errors revealed an asymmetry in both groups, with more accurate tilt errors for judgments directed to lower than higher floors. The relevance of these results for the source of the asymmetry is discussed.

AB  - Propolis is an ancient remedy well known for its beneficial properties. The aim of our study was to estimate the frequency of sensitization to propolis in our pediatric patch test population. 1255 children, 583 boys and 672 girls, aged from 7 months to 12 years, were patch tested for suspected allergic contact dermatitis with our pediatric series of 30 allergens including propolis. Out of these, 37% were affected by atopic dermatitis. Among the 1255 children tested, 113 (9%), 60 boys and 53 girls reacted to propolis. In subjects reacting to propolis the dermatitis involved the face in 4% of cases, the trunk in 3%, the hands in 2,2%, and the flexural skin folds of the limbs in 1,7%. The wider and wider use of propolis in ?natural products? and biocosmetics, even in the pediatric age, could explain the high frequency of positive patch test responses to propolis we observed.

AB  - Abstract??? The objective of the study was to assess the prevalence of dental injuries and the influence of determining factors in preschool children from Belo Horizonte, Brazil. A cross-sectional survey was carried out through clinical examinations and the application of a questionnaire to the parents of 419 children aged 0 to 5?years attending preschool. The sample was stratified by region, type of institution and age. The eighteen preschools visited were chosen randomly. The prevalence of traumatic injury to primary teeth was 39.1%. Enamel fractures were the most common traumatic injury (49.7%). Boys were 1.62 times more likely to have dental injuries than girls. Children with inadequate lip coverage were 3.75 times more likely to have a traumatic dental injury than those with adequate lip coverage. Children attending state preschools had nearly two times greater chances of having dental trauma than children attending private preschools. It was concluded that the prevalence of dental injuries in preschool children is high in Belo Horizonte, Brazil and constitutes a public health problem.

AB  - Aims To present a series of urinary bladder xanthomas and characterize their clinical features and associated pathology. Methods and results We retrieved the clinicopathological data of bladder xanthomas, with and without associated urothelial neoplasms. We identified six isolated bladder xanthomas and 11 arising within or adjacent to urothelial neoplasms. The biopsies showed lamina propria aggregates of foamy histiocytes, without an accompanying inflammation. Patients presented either incidentally or with microscopic haematuria or irritative symptoms. Patients with isolated xanthomas had a mean age of 65.3 years (range: 54?75 years) and an equal male to female ratio. Four of five patients with isolated xanthomas with available serum results had an abnormal lipid profile. Eleven patients had xanthomas associated with urothelial neoplasms [papilloma n = 4, papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential (PUNLMP) n = 2 and low-grade urothelial carcinoma n = 5]. Mean patient age was 62.5 years (range: 51?69 years) and all were male. Of the six patients with metabolic abnormalities, five had hypercholesterolaemia and one had a history of diabetes mellitus. Conclusion Bladder xanthomas are rare lesions found in older patients who present either non-specifically or with microscopic haematuria or irritative symptoms. These lesions are often associated with underlying lipid abnormalities. A biopsy is recommended for an accurate diagnosis and to exclude neoplasia.

AB  - Objective? To record 17 cases of nocardiosis in cats from eastern Australia and to compare this series with cases previously reported. Design? Retrospective/prospective study. Results? Nocardia spp infections were diagnosed in 17 cats over 14 years from the three eastern states of Australia. There were no isolates from dogs during this period, but one isolate from a koala and two from dairy cows. The majority of cats presented with spreading lesions of the subcutis and skin associated with draining sinus tract(s). Early cutaneous lesions consisted of circumscribed abscesses. Infections spread at a variable rate, generally by extension to adjacent tissues. Lesions were generally located in regions subjected to cat bite or scratch injuries, including limbs, body wall, inguinal panniculus and nasal bridge. In some other cases, lesions were situated on distal extremities. The clinical course was variable, from chronic, indolent, initially localised infections to acute fulminating disease. Of the 17 cats, 14 were domestic crossbreds and three were purebreds. There was a preponderance of male cats (12 castrated, 1 entire young adult, 1 entire kitten). Nine of 17 cats were 10 years or older. Interestingly, the majority of infections were attributable to N nova. Immediate and/or predisposing causes could be identified in all cases, and included: renal transplantation [one cat]; chronic corticosteroid administration [three cats]; catabolic state following chylothorax surgery [one cat]; fight injuries [seven cats]; FIV infections [three of seven cats tested]. Of the 17 cats, three were apparently cured. Four were thought to be cured, but infection recurred after several months. Three cats responded partially but were euthanased, while another was improving when it died of unrelated complications. Two died despite treatment and two were euthanased without an attempt at therapy. For two cats there were either insufficient records or the patient was lost to follow up. Conclusion? Nocardiosis is a rare, serious disease. Currently it is more common in cats than dogs. Nocardial panniculitis may be clinically indistinguishable from the syndrome caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria. Although the prognosis is guarded, patients with localised infections caused by N nova often respond to appropriate therapy. If definitive treatment is delayed because of misdiagnosis, the disease tends to become chronic, extensive and refractory. Insufficient duration of therapy leads to disease recurrence.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare an estimate of blood loss obtained using measurements from the Hemocue photometer with a standard estimate in dogs undergoing spinal surgery. Study design? Prospective clinical study. Animals? Twenty-nine client-owned dogs. Methods? During surgery, blood and all lavage fluids were collected in the suction container and on to swabs. To prevent blood clot formation in the suction container, 10?mL citrate-phosphate dextrose adenine (CPDA) was added. At the end of the procedure, the total volume in the suction container was recorded. It was shaken to ensure uniformity and a 5 mL sample tested with the HemoCue photometer. Blood loss in the suction container was calculated as follows: Blood in suction (mL)?=?volume in bottle (mL)???[suction haemoglobin (Hb) concentration (g?dL?1)/pre-operative Hb concentration (g dL?1)]. This volume was added to the estimated volume of blood on the swabs (weight of soaked swabs minus that of dry swabs) to provide the Hemocue estimate of total blood loss. A standard haemorrhage estimate was performed using the volume of fluid in the suction container at the end of surgery in excess of the total volume of lavage fluid available, minus 10?mL CPDA. This volume was added to the estimated volume of blood on the swabs to provide the standard estimate of total blood loss. Data were analyzed with a paired t-test. Retrospective power calculations demonstrated an 80% power to detect a mean difference of 25?mL between the two methods with a level of significance of 0.05. Results? There was no significant difference in calculated blood loss between the two methods (p?=?0.8, mean difference: ?2?mL, 95% CI: ?20 to 16?mL). Conclusions and clinical relevance? The HemoCue may be used to help estimate blood loss in dogs undergoing spinal surgery.
