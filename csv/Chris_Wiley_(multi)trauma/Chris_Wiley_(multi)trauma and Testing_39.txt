Abstract:? Introduction:? Recombinant P-selectin glycoprotein ligand IgG fusion protein, rPSGL-Ig (YSPSL), a fusion protein of human P-selectin ligand and IgG1-Fc, blocks leukocyte adhesion and protects against ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) in animal models. Patients and Methods:? This randomized 15-center, double-blind, 59-patient Ph2a study assessed YSPSL?s safety in recipients of deceased-donor kidney allografts and its potential efficacy in improving early graft function. Two doses and two dosing modalities were evaluated. Results:? No drug-specific toxicities or increased adverse event rates were noted. Two YSPSL-treated patients died of causes determined as unrelated to study drug. YSPSL did not reduce the incidence of dialysis within the first week post-transplant (41% in treated vs. 20% in placebo patients). Renal function endpoints scored at post-operative days 1 & 2 were also not impacted by YSPSL. However, at day 5, the fraction of patients with serum creatinine above 6?mg/dL was lower in the YSPSL vs. placebo group (26% vs. 55%, p?=?0.043). Large variations in the dialysis-delayed graft function (DGF) rates were observed between centers, independently of treatment assignment, indicating subjectivity of this endpoint. Conclusion:? In this first Ph2a study in kidney transplantation, YSPSL was safe but did not impact the dialysis-DGF rate. Further studies with more objective efficacy endpoints are required to define the impact of YSPSL on early renal allograft function.

AB  - The study investigated the emergence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in child and adolescent survivors in Turkey three years after the 1999 Marmara Earthquake, with consideration of the severity of exposure and the survivors' gender and age. A representative sample of 293 young earthquake survivors (152 female and 141 male between the ages of 8 and 15) participated in the study. Participants' scores on the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index for Children indicated that 31.4% reported moderate, 24.2% reported severe, and 3.8% reported very severe traumatic stress reactions. Analysis of the Revised Impact of Events Scale for Children scores revealed that 56% reported severe PTSD symptoms. While severity of exposure and gender were significantly associated with severity of PTSD symptoms, age was not related to PTSD symptoms. The results indicated a high need for addressing the mental health problems of the child and adolescent trauma survivors in Turkey.

AB  - Abstract Background: We report a multi-institutional experience with intravascular stenting (IS) for treatment of coarctation of the aorta. Methods and Results: Data was collected retrospectively by review of medical records from 17 institutions. The data was broken down to prior to 2002 and after 2002 for further analysis. A total of 565 procedures were performed with a median age of 15 years (mean = 18.1 years). Successful reduction in the post stent gradient (<20 mm Hg) or increase in post stent coarctation to descending aorta (DAo) ratio of >0.8 was achieved in 97.9% of procedures. There was significant improvement (P < 0.01) in pre versus post stent coarctation dimensions (7.4 mm ± 3.0 mm vs. 14.3 ± 3.2mm), systolic gradient (31.6 mm Hg ± 16.0 mm Hg vs. 2.7 mm Hg ± 4.2 mm Hg) and ratio of the coarctation segment to the DAo (0.43 ± 0.17 vs. 0.85 ± 0.15). Acute complications were encountered in 81/565 (14.3%) procedures. There were two procedure related deaths. Aortic wall complications included: aneurysm formation (n = 6), intimal tears (n = 8), and dissections (n = 9). The risk of aortic dissection increased significantly in patients over the age of 40 years. Technical complications included stent migration (n = 28), and balloon rupture (n = 13). Peripheral vascular complications included cerebral vascular accidents (CVA) (n = 4), peripheral emboli (n = 1), and significant access arterial injury (n = 13). Older age was significantly associated with occurrence of CVAs. A significant decrease in the technical complication rate from 16.3% to 6.1% (P < 0.001) was observed in procedures performed after January 2002. Conclusions: Stent placement for coarctation of aorta is an effective treatment option, though it remains a technically challenging procedure. Technical and aortic complications have decreased over the past 3 years due to, in part, improvement in balloon and stent design. Improvement in our ability to assess aortic wall compliance is essential prior to placement of ISs in older patients with coarctation of the aorta. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To investigate the utility of multimodal quantitative MRI (qMRI) and atlas-based methods to identify characteristics of lesion-driven injury and neurodegeneration in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Materials and Methods: This work is health insurance portability and accountability act compliant. High resolution T1-weighted, dual echo, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion tensor MRI images were prospectively acquired on 68 RRMS patients (range, 25?58 years) and 68 age-matched controls. The data were analyzed using standardized human brain atlas-based tissue segmentation procedures to obtain regional volumes and their corresponding T2 relaxation times and DTI maps. Results: Group-averaged brain atlas-based qMRI maps of T2, fractional anisotropy and diffusivities are visually presented and compared between controls and RRMS. The analysis shows a widespread injury in RRMS. Atrophy of the corpus callosum (CC) was substantial in RRMS. The qMRI attributes of the neocortex in combination with the CC such as T2 and diffusivities were elevated and correlated with disability. Conclusion: Using a standardized multimodal qMRI acquisition and analyses that accounted for lesion distribution we demonstrate that cerebral pathology is widespread in RRMS. Our analysis of CC and neocortex qMRI metrics in relation to disability points to a neurodegenerative injury component that is independent from lesions. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Abstract:? A vast literature extolling the benefits of melatonin has accumulated during the past four decades. Melatonin was previously considered of importance to seasonal reproduction and circadian rhythmicity. Currently, it appears to be a versatile anti-oxidative and anti-nitrosative agent, a molecule with immunomodulatory actions and profound oncostatic activity, and also to play a role as a potent neuroprotectant. Nowadays, melatonin is sold as a dietary supplement with differential availability as an over-the-counter aid in different countries. There is a widespread agreement that melatonin is nontoxic and safe considering its frequent, long-term usage by humans at both physiological and pharmacological doses with no reported side effects. Endeavors toward a designated drug status for melatonin may be enormously rewarding in clinics for treatment of several forms of neurotrauma where effective pharmacological intervention has not yet been attained. This mini review consolidates the data regarding the efficacy of melatonin as an unique neuroprotective agent in traumatic central nervous system (CNS) injuries. Well-documented actions of melatonin in combating traumatic CNS damage are compiled from various clinical and experimental studies. Research on traumatic brain injury and ischemia/reperfusion are briefly outlined here as they have been recently reviewed elsewhere, whereas the studies on different animal models of the experimental spinal cord injury have been extensively covered in this mini review for the first time.

AB  - Background To ascertain the full mortality of influenza and other respiratory viruses, the testing of community autopsy specimens is essential. Methods Respiratory virus PCR and culture were performed on 2418 fresh unfrozen respiratory samples collected from 1611 coronial cases where the death was either unknown or infection was suspected, from July 2007 to June 2011, to detect the common respiratory viruses in children and adults, using standardized microbiological testing. Results The respiratory virus positive rate was 8·3% (134 cases) with a peak of 28% (42 of 151 cases) in children under 10 years of age. Influenza virus was the commonest respiratory virus (50 cases, 3%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (30 cases, 2%). All tested respiratory viruses were found in children, most commonly adenovirus, enterovirus and RSV, and influenza A and RSV predominated in those over 60 years, but coinfection was uncommon. Almost all influenza cases occurred when influenza was widely circulating in the community but few were diagnosed pre-mortem. Influenza and RSV detection was associated with bronchitis or bronchiolitis in 7 (9%) of the 80 cases and caused pneumonia in 14 (0·8%) deaths overall. Conclusions Our prospective review of respiratory viruses using standardized testing found a single lower respiratory tract autopsy specimen for respiratory virus PCR would detect most community infections at the time of death.

AB  - Abstract Little is known about the relationship between mother and infant within multiproblem, so-called ?hard to reach? families. In an effort to understand factors contributing to problems in caring for the young children of these parents, a group of 47 families was recruited for study by the Clinical Infant Development Program of the National Institute of Mental Health. Serious social pathology was found within 75 percent of families. The lives of mothers in these families was marked by long term disruptions: 64 percent were from families characterized by recurring poverty and psychiatric illness, and 69 percent reported disruptions in parental care prior to age twelve, while more than two-thirds reported a history of being physically and/or sexually abused as children. More than 75 percent of this group of women presently showed psychiatric distress. Many of these women have difficulty in providing adequately for their young children and require innovative intervention programs in order to facilitate parenting.

AB  - ?Thinking a lot? (TAL)?also referred to as ?thinking too much??is a key complaint in many cultural contexts, and the current article profiles this idiom of distress among Cambodian refugees. The article also proposes a general model of how TAL generates various types of distress that then cause PTSD-type psychopathology, a model we refer to as the TAL?PTSD model. As tested in this Cambodian refugee sample, the model is supported by the following: (1) the close connection of TAL to PTSD as shown by odds ratio (OR = 19.6), correlation (r = .86), and factor loading; and (2) the mediation of most of the effect of TAL on PTSD by TAL-caused somatic symptoms, catastrophic cognitions, trauma recall, insomnia, and irritability. The questionnaire used in the present study is provided and can be used to examine TAL in other cultural and global contexts to advance the study of this commonly encountered distress form.

AB  - Abstract Objective.? To determine whether pre- and post-operative administration of intravenous ibuprofen (IV-ibuprofen) can significantly decrease pain and morphine use when compared with placebo in adult orthopedic surgical patients. Design.? This was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Setting.? This study was completed at eight hospitals; six in the United States and two in South Africa. Patients.? A total of 185 adult patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery. Interventions.? Patients were randomized to receive either 800?mg IV-ibuprofen or placebo every 6 hours, with the first dose administered pre-operatively. Additionally, all patients had access to intravenous morphine for rescue. Outcome Measures.? Efficacy of IV-ibuprofen was demonstrated by measuring the patient's self assessment of pain using a visual analog scale (VAS; assessed with movement and at rest) and a verbal response scale (VRS). Morphine consumption during the post-operative period was also assessed. Results.? In the immediate post-operative period, there was a 25.8% reduction in mean area under the curve-VAS assessed with movement (AUC-VASM) in patients receiving IV-ibuprofen (P?<?0.001); a 31.8% reduction in mean AUC-VAS assessed at rest (AUC-VASR; P?<?0.001) and a 20.2% reduction in mean VRS (P?<?0.001) compared to those receiving placebo. Patients receiving IV-ibuprofen used 30.9% less morphine (P?<?0.001) compared to those receiving placebo. Similar treatment emergent adverse events occurred in both study groups and there were no significant differences in the incidence of serious adverse events. Conclusion.? Pre- and post-operative administration of IV-ibuprofen significantly reduced both pain and morphine use in orthopedic surgery patients in this prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The American Heart Association recommends automated external defibrillator placement in public areas with a high probability (>1) of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) occurring in 5 years. We aimed to determine the incidence rate of OHCA for different location categories in Singapore. Methods Cardiac arrest incidence was obtained from a national registry. Denominators for the actual number of sites per location category were obtained from public accessible sources, government officers and purchased statistics. Analysis was performed and expressed in terms of the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Results From 1 October 2001 to 14 October 2004, 2254 non-trauma OHCA cases were included. Mean age for arrests was 62.2 years, with 67.5% men. The location category with the highest incidence of cardiac arrests per site per 5 years was Port/Airport/Immigration Checkpoints (5.24 CI [3.66?7.20]). Top individual site with high average incidence of cardiac arrests per 5 years was Changi Airport (25.0 CI [16.18?36.90]). Seventy-one per cent of arrests occurred in residential areas. The postal sector with the highest average incidence per 100?000 population was Bedok Reservoir (54.89), whereas that with the highest population density was Bukit Merah/Alexandra with 348.14 population per 100 km2. Conclusion In this study, we found the categories and individual sites that clearly fulfilled the American Heart Association criteria of at least 1 OHCA per site per 5 years. This study provides a model of how cardiac arrest registry data can be used to guide local health policy on automated external defibrillator deployment.

AB  - Background:? The objectives of this study were to (1) describe the haemodynamic profile of patients with extensive burns during the early fluid resuscitation phase, (2) evaluate myocardial performance by invasive monitoring and echocardiography and (3) analyze the relations between serum cytokine (IL-6, IL-8, TNF) and natriuretic peptide (ANP, BNP) concentrations and myocardial function in these patients. Methods:? Prospective, clinical study in a tertiary care burn centre. Invasive haemodynamic measurements including a pulmonary artery catheter, echocardiography, blood samples for cytokine and atriopeptide analyses. The follow-up time was up to 72?h postinjury. Results:? According to echocardiography, patients were hypovolaemic despite aggressive (median 7,9?ml?kg?1?h?1, range 3.3?11.7) fluid resuscitation and adequate urine output (median 0.9?ml?kg?1?h?1, range 0.46?1.35) during the first day postinjury. There were no consistent findings of hyperlactatemia, metabolic acidosis or low mixed venous oxygen saturations. Daily highest and lowest values of cardiac index and stroke volume index increased and the lowest and highest values of systemic vascular resistance decreased. Cardiac performance (stroke volume index) improved during the study period even though there were no initial signs of myocardial depression in echocardiography. Three patients received a dobutamine infusion based on clinical judgement. There was no consistent association between haemodynamic changes and plasma cytokine concentrations. Conclusion:? Persisting hypovolaemia is evident in the resuscitation phase of extensive burns despite aggressive fluid therapy and the lack of classic signs of hypoperfusion. Cardiac performance improves during the first days after extensive burn injury without association with plasma cytokine profile.

However, dissemination efforts have not always translated into sustainability, which has prompted a more thorough investigation into those factors that impact implementation and encouraged the development of strategies that promote sustainability. Toward this end, the aims of this study were to: (1) determine which components of TF-CBT clinicians found the most difficult to implement; (2) explore clinicians? perceptions as to why these components were challenging; and (3) examine whether the use of formalized problem-solving approaches (FPSAs) or training format was associated with implementation outcomes. Methods A mixed methods design was utilized to analyse survey data from mental health professionals (N = 85) who received TF-CBT training. Thematic analysis explored responses to questions concerning those TF-CBT components respondents found most difficult to implement, while bivariate analyses helped determine whether training format or the use of FPSAs was associated with training engagement, confidence in delivering TF-CBT, fidelity or sustainability. Results Clinicians perceived the same three components of TF-CBT as most difficult regardless of the type of training they received, and provider, youth, caregiver, and organizational-related themes emerged from thematic analysis. Bivariate analyses indicated more extended training formats and the use of FPSAs were associated with greater implementation success. Conclusion Findings suggest that perceived difficulty of TF-CBT components did not vary by training format, but more extended formats and the use of FPSAs were associated with more favourable implementation outcomes. Implementers should consider ways to utilize FPSAs within training programs, as well as focus on content identified by clinicians as difficult, as this may assist clinicians in developing skills and managing implementation barriers.

AB  - This study examined factors related to children's acute symptoms following a potentially traumatic event (PTE) to more clearly identify domains that should be included in screenings of youth exposed to a PTE. In particular, the authors examined whether trauma category (i.e., sexual abuse/disclosure of abuse, intentionally perpetrated traumas other than sexual abuse, and unintentional traumas) was related to symptoms after controlling for other relevant factors. Participants were 112 youth presenting for clinical evaluation within a month of a PTE and their nonoffending caregivers. Using data from baseline assessments collected as part of a randomized controlled trial of a secondary prevention program, the following factors were tested in 3 hierarchical regression models: index PTE category, history of traumatic exposure, preindex event functioning, and parenting behaviors. Prior trauma exposure, preindex event functioning, and hostile parenting were uniquely related to children's symptoms in the acute posttraumatic period after controlling for time since the event and child age, but trauma category was not. Implications for identifying and referring children at high risk for poor outcomes in the early aftermath of a PTE are discussed. An exclusive focus on the event is insufficient and more comprehensive understanding of the child and family is required.

AB  - Summary Background Previous studies investigating factors associated with survival following endoscopic treatment of contamination/sepsis of the calcaneal bursa are limited. Objectives To investigate the factors associated with survival in horses with contamination/sepsis of the calcaneal bursae treated endoscopically and to describe the bacterial isolates involved in the synovial infections. Study design Retrospective analysis of clinical records. Methods Medical records from 128 horses with contamination/sepsis of the calcaneal bursae treated by endoscopic lavage at seven equine hospitals were reviewed. A follow-up questionnaire was used to determine survival and return to athletic performance. Descriptive statistics and Cox proportional hazards survival models were used to determine factors associated with survival. Results Horses underwent one (n = 107), two (n = 19), or three (n = 2) surgeries. Survival to hospital discharge was 84.4%. Univariable survival analysis revealed that administration of systemic antimicrobials prior to referral was associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio, [HR] 0.41, 95% CI 0.18?0.91, P = 0.03). Increased mortality was associated with bone fracture/osteomyelitis (HR 2.43, 95% CI 1.12?5.26, P = 0.03), tendon involvement (≥30% cross sectional area) (HR 3.78 95% CI 1.78?8.04, P = 0.001), duration of general anaesthesia (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00?1.02, P = 0.04), post-operative synoviocentesis (HR 3.18, 95% CI 1.36?7.43, P = 0.006) and post-operative wound dehiscence (HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.08?5.65, P = 0.04). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model revealed reduced mortality after systemic antimicrobial administration prior to referral (HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11?0.60, P = 0.002) and increased mortality with tendinous involvement (≥30% cross-sectional area) (HR 7.92, 95% CI 3.31?19.92, P<0.001). At follow-up (median 30 months, range 0.25?13 years, n = 70) 87.1% horses were alive, 7.1% had been euthanised due to the calcaneal injury and 5.7% had been euthanised for unrelated reasons. From 57 horses with athletic performance follow-up, 91.2% returned to the same/higher level of exercise, 5.3% to a lower level and 3.5% were retired due to persistent lameness of the affected limb. Main limitations Retrospective study and incomplete follow-up. Conclusion Endoscopic treatment of contamination/sepsis of the calcaneal bursae has an 84% survival rate to hospital discharge. Tendinous involvement reduced survival whilst systemic antimicrobials administration prior to referral improved survival.

AB  - We assess fiscal performances in G7 and selected Latin American and Asian countries. We consider two questions: (i) Have public finances been sustainable? (ii) Do countries follow more restrictive fiscal policies when debt starts to rise? We find that: (i) the traditional unit root tests often overlook the corrective actions taken by many governments; controlling for structural breaks changes the non-stationarity results dramatically among the three groups; (ii) estimation of a reaction function for governments, expanded by incorporating structural breaks, provides further evidence for significant active anti-debt policies among G7 countries, and to a lesser extent in the other regions.

AB  - Abstract Detecting the presence of injuries to the cervical spine is an important component of the initial assessment of patients sustaining blunt trauma. A small proportion of cervical spine injuries consists of ligamentous disruption. Accurate detection of ligamentous injury is essential as it may result in sequelae including radiculopathy, quadriplegia and death. Flexion?extension (FE) radiography has traditionally been utilised for the detection of ligamentous injury in patients who have been cleared of bony injury. There are controversies surrounding the use of FE for alert patients with neck pain. There are studies that call into question the diagnostic accuracy of FE, the high proportion of inadequate FE images due to muscle spasm and the adverse effects of prolonged cervical collar immobilisation while awaiting FE. Other literature indicates that FE provides no additional diagnostic information following a multi-detector helical computed tomography. This review evaluates the literature on the utility of FE for the detection of ligamentous injury and explores alternate strategies for clearing the cervical spine of ligamentous injury.

AB  - Abstract Indigenous women are subjected to high rates of multiple forms of violence, including intimate partner violence (IPV), in the context of ongoing colonization and neo-colonization. Health promotion interventions for women who experience violence have not been tailored specifically for Indigenous women. Reclaiming Our Spirits (ROS) is a health promotion intervention designed for Indigenous women living in an urban context in Canada. In this paper, we describe the development of the intervention, results of a pilot study, and the revised subsequent intervention. Building on a theory-based health promotion intervention (iHEAL) showing promising results in feasibility studies, ROS was developed using a series of related approaches including (a) guidance from Indigenous women with research expertise specific to IPV and Indigenous women's experiences; (b) articulation of an Indigenous lens, including using Cree (one of the largest Indigenous language groups in North America) concepts to identify key aspects; and (c) interviews with Elders (n?=?10) living in the study setting. Offered over 6?8 months, ROS consists of a Circle, led by an Indigenous Elder, and 1:1 visits with a Registered Nurse, focused on six areas for health promotion derived from previous research. Pilot testing with Indigenous women (n?=?21) produced signs of improvement in most measures of health from pre- to post-intervention. Women found the pilot intervention acceptable and helpful but also offered valuable suggestions for improvement. A revised intervention, with greater structure within the Circle and nurses with stronger knowledge of Indigenous women's experience and community health, is currently undergoing testing. ? 2017 The Authors.
