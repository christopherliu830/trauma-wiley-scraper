AB  - Owing to the potentially devastating effects of trauma-induced depression, explaining the relationship between trauma and depressive symptoms is important. In this study, we measured lifelong exposure to potentially traumatic events and depressive symptoms in 370-female undergraduates. We also measured anxiety, past negative time perspective and dissociation as potential mediators. Trauma exposure and depressive symptoms were related with a small but significant effect size (r = .16). Trauma was not associated with dissociation. We found that past negative time perspective and anxiety were full statistical mediators of this trauma-depressive symptoms relationship. These two mediators combined accounted for all of the variance in that association. Anxiety accounted for more of the variance than past negative time perspective. A proposed explanation is that trauma both affectively elevates anxiety and cognitively creates an enduring focus on the events. Chronic anxiety and a past negative time perspective may lead to depression over time. The clinical implications are possible explanations as to why some treatments work.

AB  - This paper reviews the research evidence concerning the intergenerational transmission of trauma effects and the possible role of epigenetic mechanisms in this transmission. Two broad categories of epigenetically mediated effects are highlighted. The first involves developmentally programmed effects. These can result from the influence of the offspring's early environmental exposures, including postnatal maternal care as well as in utero exposure reflecting maternal stress during pregnancy. The second includes epigenetic changes associated with a preconception trauma in parents that may affect the germline, and impact fetoplacental interactions. Several factors, such as sex-specific epigenetic effects following trauma exposure and parental developmental stage at the time of exposure, explain different effects of maternal and paternal trauma. The most compelling work to date has been done in animal models, where the opportunity for controlled designs enables clear interpretations of transmissible effects. Given the paucity of human studies and the methodological challenges in conducting such studies, it is not possible to attribute intergenerational effects in humans to a single set of biological or other determinants at this time. Elucidating the role of epigenetic mechanisms in intergenerational effects through prospective, multi-generational studies may ultimately yield a cogent understanding of how individual, cultural and societal experiences permeate our biology.

AB  - AbstractSevere extremity trauma often results in large zones of injury comprising multiple types of tissue and presents many clinical challenges for reconstruction. Considerable investigation is ongoing in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine therapeutics to improve reconstruction outcomes; however, the vast majority of musculoskeletal trauma models employed for testing the therapeutics consist of single-tissue defects, offering limited utility for investigating strategies for multi-tissue repair. Here we present the first model of composite lower limb bone and nerve injury, characterized by comparison to well-established, single-tissue injury models, using biomaterials-based technologies previously demonstrated to show promise in those models. Quantitative functional outcome measures were incorporated to facilitate assessment of new technologies to promote structural and functional limb salvage following severe extremity trauma. Nerve injury induced significant changes in the morphology and mechanical properties of intact bones. However, BMP-mediated segmental bone regeneration was not significantly impaired by concomitant nerve injury, as evaluated via radiographs, microcomputed tomography (?CT) and biomechanical testing. Neither was nerve regeneration significantly impaired by bone injury when evaluated via histology and electrophysiology. Despite the similar tissue regeneration observed, the composite injury group experienced a marked functional deficit in the operated limb compared to either of the single-tissue injury groups, as determined by quantitative, automated CatWalk gait analysis. As a whole, this study presents a challenging, clinically relevant model of severe extremity trauma to bone and nerve tissue, and emphasizes the need to incorporate quantitative functional outcome measures to benchmark tissue engineering therapies.

AB  - Oral Diseases (2010) 16, 188?192 Objective:? The purpose of this study was to investigate clinical and psychological characteristics of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) patients with trauma history. Materials and methods:? The clinical and psychological characteristics of 34 TMD patients with trauma history were compared with those of 340 TMD patients without trauma history. Craniomandibular index (CMI) was used for clinical characteristics of TMD patients. Symptom severity index (SSI) was used to assess the multiple dimensions of pain. Symptom checklist-90-revision (SCL-90-R) was used for psychological evaluation. Results:? Temporomandibular disorders patients with trauma history displayed significantly higher CMI and palpation index. TMD patients with trauma history also exhibited higher values in duration, sensory intensity, affective intensity, tolerability, scope of symptom, and total SSI score. In addition, these patients showed significantly higher values in symptom dimensions of somatization, depression, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and paranoid ideation. Among the symptom dimensions of SCL-90-R, somatization showed the most significant correlations with CMI and SSI. Conclusions:? Temporomandibular disorders patients with trauma history displayed more severe subjective, objective, and psychological dysfunction than those without trauma history. Pain of myogenous origin, history of physical trauma, and psychosocial dysfunction were all closely related.

Materials and Methods Prospective observational study on a new point-of-care ultrasound protocol on 64 dogs suffering from trauma and comparison of findings with radiology. Results Comparison of the results of this new ultrasound protocol for trauma patients with radiography findings for pneumothorax, pleural effusion, alveolar-interstitial syndrome and abdominal effusion revealed positive agreement of 89, 83, 100 and 87% and negative agreement of 76, 83, 76 and 92%, respectively. Novel findings of the ?veterinary focused assessment with sonography for trauma-airway, breathing, circulation, disability and exposure? exam, which were not previously reported for dogs undergoing focused assessment with sonography for trauma, included alveolar-interstitial syndrome (suggestive of pulmonary contusions), diaphragmatic hernia, retroperitoneal effusion and tracheal injury. Our new technique may also help identify increased intracranial pressure via changes in optic nerve sheath diameter and haemodynamic instability through the evaluation of the caudal vena cava and cardiac function. Clinical Significance The described ultrasound examination protocol can be rapidly performed on dogs suffering from trauma during resuscitation and it may detect injuries previously undetectable using other veterinary point-of-care ultrasound protocols.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aims In 2005 the American College of Surgeons passed a mandate requiring that level I trauma centers have mechanisms to identify and intervene with problem drinkers. The aim of this investigation was to determine if a multi-level trauma center intervention targeting both providers and patients would lead to higher-quality alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) when compared with trauma center mandate compliance without implementation enhancements. Design Cluster randomized trial in which intervention site (site n?=?10, patient n?=?409) providers received 1-day workshop training on evidence-based motivational interviewing (MI) alcohol interventions and four 30-minute feedback and coaching sessions; control sites (site n?=?10, patient n?=?469) implemented the mandate without study team training enhancements. Setting Trauma centers in the United States of America. Participants A total of 878 blood alcohol-positive in-patients with and without traumatic brain injury (TBI). Measurements MI skills of providers were assessed with fidelity coded standardized patient interviews. All patients were interviewed at baseline and 6- and 12-months post-injury with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Findings Intervention site providers consistently demonstrated enhanced MI skills compared with control providers. Intervention patients demonstrated an 8% reduction in AUDIT hazardous drinking relative to controls over the course of the year after injury (relative risk?=?0.88, 95%, confidence interval?=?0.79, 0.98). Intervention patients were more likely to demonstrate improvements in alcohol use problems in the absence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) (P?=?0.002). Conclusion Trauma center providers can be trained to deliver higher-quality alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) than untrained providers, which is associated with modest reductions in alcohol use problems, particularly among patients without TBI.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: Although individual HIV rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) show good performance in evaluations conducted by WHO, reports from several African countries highlight potentially significant performance issues. Despite widespread use of RDTs for HIV diagnosis in resource-constrained settings, there has been no systematic, head-to-head evaluation of their accuracy with specimens from diverse settings across sub-Saharan Africa. We conducted a standardized, centralized evaluation of eight HIV RDTs and two simple confirmatory assays at a WHO collaborating centre for evaluation of HIV diagnostics using specimens from six sites in five sub-Saharan African countries. Methods: Specimens were transported to the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM), Antwerp, Belgium for testing. The tests were evaluated by comparing their results to a state-of-the-art reference algorithm to estimate sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. Results: 2785 samples collected from August 2011 to January 2015 were tested at ITM. All RDTs showed very high sensitivity, from 98.8% for First Response HIV Card Test 1?2.0 to 100% for Determine HIV 1/2, Genie Fast, SD Bioline HIV 1/2 3.0 and INSTI HIV-1/HIV-2 Antibody Test kit. Specificity ranged from 90.4% for First Response to 99.7% for HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK with wide variation based on the geographical origin of specimens. Multivariate analysis showed several factors were associated with false-positive results, including gender, provider-initiated testing and the geographical origin of specimens. For simple confirmatory assays, the total sensitivity and specificity was 100% and 98.8% for ImmunoComb II HIV 12 CombFirm (ImmunoComb) and 99.7% and 98.4% for Geenius HIV 1/2 with indeterminate rates of 8.9% and 9.4%. Conclusions: In this first systematic head-to-head evaluation of the most widely used RDTs, individual RDTs performed more poorly than in the WHO evaluations: only one test met the recommended thresholds for RDTs of ≥99% sensitivity and ≥98% specificity. By performing all tests in a centralized setting, we show that these differences in performance cannot be attributed to study procedure, end-user variation, storage conditions, or other methodological factors. These results highlight the existence of geographical and population differences in individual HIV RDT performance and underscore the challenges of designing locally validated algorithms that meet the latest WHO-recommended thresholds.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The effectiveness of massive transfusion protocols (MTPs) has been assumed from low quality studies with multiple biases. This review aimed to (i) evaluate the association between the institution of an MTP and mortality and (ii) determine the effect of MTPs on transfusion practice post trauma. Methods A systematic review of studies that examined patient outcomes before and after the institution of an MTP in the same centre was conducted. The design and results of each study were described. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q test and the I2 statistic. Odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes from each study were pooled. Results There were eight studies that satisfied inclusion criteria with marked heterogeneity in study populations (I2 = 72.1%, P = 0.001). Two studies showed significantly improved mortality following implementation of an MTP, and six studies showed no significant change. Pooled OR for the effect of an MTP on short-term mortality was 0.73 (95% confidence interval: 0.48?1.11). The effect of MTPs on transfusion practice was varied. Conclusion Despite the popularity of MTPs and directives mandating their use in trauma centres, in before?after studies, MTPs have not always been associated with improved mortality. Evidence-based standardization of MTPs, improved compliance and analysis of broader endpoints were identified as areas for further research.

AB  - Objective:? To review the research addressing the relationship of childhood trauma to psychosis and schizophrenia, and to discuss the theoretical and clinical implications. Method:? Relevant studies and previous review papers were identified via computer literature searches. Results:? Symptoms considered indicative of psychosis and schizophrenia, particularly hallucinations, are at least as strongly related to childhood abuse and neglect as many other mental health problems. Recent large-scale general population studies indicate the relationship is a causal one, with a dose-effect. Conclusion:? Several psychological and biological mechanisms by which childhood trauma increases risk for psychosis merit attention. Integration of these different levels of analysis may stimulate a more genuinely integrated bio-psycho-social model of psychosis than currently prevails. Clinical implications include the need for staff training in asking about abuse and the need to offer appropriate psychosocial treatments to patients who have been abused or neglected as children. Prevention issues are also identified.

AB  - Objectives:? This study examined: (i) the prevalence of trauma in a bipolar disorder (BD) sample, and (ii) how trauma histories mediated by interpersonal difficulties and alcohol dependence impact on the severity of BD. The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its relationship to outcomes in BD were also examined. Methods:? Sixty participants were recruited from a geographically well-defined mental health service in Northern Ireland. Self-reported trauma histories, PTSD, interpersonal difficulties and alcohol dependence and were examined in relation to illness severity. Results:? A high prevalence of trauma was found. Trauma predicted the frequency of hospital admissions (R2?=?0.08), quality of life (R2?=?0.23) and inter-episode depressive symptoms (R2?=?0.13). Interpersonal difficulties, but not alcohol dependence, appeared to play an important role in mediating these adverse effects. While only 8% of the sample met criteria for active PTSD, this comorbid disorder was associated with BD severity. Conclusions:? This study indicates that awareness of trauma is important in understanding individual differences in bipolar presentations. The theoretical and clinical implications of evidence that trauma is related to more adverse outcomes in BD are discussed. The finding that interpersonal difficulties mediate the relationship between trauma and BD severity is novel. The need for adjunctive evidence-based treatments targeting interpersonal difficulties is considered.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the ventricular rate response of rate-adaptive (VVIR) pacemakers in dogs using a multi-stage exercise test. Methods: The rate-responsiveness of VVIR pacemakers was assessed in seven dogs with complete atrioventricular (AV) block and implanted with various models of pulse generators (six motion sensors and one automatic dual-sensor rate-response pacemaker). Response activity was assessed with a multi-stage exercise test on a treadmill. Atrial and ventricular rate were analysed retrospectively at the end of the test and the AV ratio was calculated after each minute of exercise. Results: During exercise, the mean (sd) AV ratio recorded in all paced dogs was 1.7 (0.5) (expected physiological ratio 1.0), although a variety of individual performances was observed. A poor response (AV ratio 2.8 [0.2]) was obtained with the automatic dual-sensor pacemaker, suggesting that this type of rate-responsive device may not be indicated for implantation in dogs with complete AV block. The overall AV ratio for the six dogs implanted with motion sensors was 1.4 (0.2), showing a better performance of these pacemakers during exercise. Clinical Significance: This multi-stage exercise test represents an easy and repeatable method for assessing the accuracy of rate-responsive sensors and offers valuable information for the correct setting of VVIR pacemakers in dogs.

AB  - Abstract The current project is a study of craniofacial trauma in a large sample (n?=?896) of Prehispanic Canary Islanders (PCIs). The possible causes and social implications of the trauma found are considered, with reference to archaeological and historical data. Variables include the island, period and ecology, the sex and age of the individuals, the distribution of lesions across the skull (by side and by individual bone) and ante-mortem tooth loss. The results show a fairly high trauma rate (16%), a low prevalence of peri-mortem trauma (3.8% of all lesions), higher prevalence of trauma in males than in females (25% vs. 13% of all individuals), more cranial than facial lesions (8.9% vs. 3.5% of all elements) and more lesions on the left side of the skull (6.7% vs. 4.5% of all elements) which suggests that the lesions were sustained through intentional rather than accidental agency. There was no correspondence between trauma prevalence and ecology. The archaeological and historical data support the assertion that the lesions may be the result of skirmishing between groups, using weapons such as slingshots, stones and staves. The presence of edged-weapon lesions on some individuals suggests that these may have been the victims of contact-period European groups. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Much of the extant literature addressing the psychosocial aspects of BRCA1/2 mutation testing and risk management aggregates mutation carriers of all ages in study recruitment, data analysis, and interpretation. This analytic strategy does not adequately address the needs of the youngest genetic testing consumers, i.e., women aged 18?25. Despite low absolute cancer risk estimates before age 30, BRCA1/2 mutation-positive women aged 18?25 feel vulnerable to a cancer diagnosis but find themselves in a management quandary because the clinical utility of screening and prevention options are not yet well defined for such young carriers. We present three cases, selected from a larger study of 32 BRCA1/2 mutation-positive women who completed or considered genetic testing before age 25, to demonstrate the unique developmental, relational and temporal influences, as well as the challenges, experienced by very young BRCA mutation-positive women as they complete genetic testing and initiate cancer risk management. The first case describes the maturation of a young woman whose family participated in a national cancer registry. The second addresses the experiences and expectations of a young woman who completed genetic testing after learning that her unaffected father was a mutation carrier. The third case highlights the experiences of a young woman parentally bereaved in childhood, who presented for genetic counseling and testing due to intense family pressure. Together, these cases suggest that BRCA1/2-positive women aged 18?25 are challenged to reconcile their burgeoning independence from their families with risk-related support needs. Loved ones acting in ways meant to care for these young women may inadvertently apply pressure, convoluting family support dynamics and autonomous decision-making. Ongoing support from competent healthcare professionals will enable these young women to remain informed and receive objective counsel about their risk-management decisions.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Volumetric studies on deep gray matter structures in bipolar disorder (BP) have reported contrasting results. Childhood trauma, a relevant environmental stressor for BP, could account for the variability of the results, modulating differences in the amygdala and hippocampus in patients with BP compared with healthy controls (HC). Our study aimed to test this hypothesis. Methods We assessed 105 outpatients, diagnosed with bipolar disorder type I (BP-I) or bipolar disorder type II (BP-II) according to DSM-IV-TR criteria, and 113 HC subjects. History of childhood trauma was obtained using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging was performed on all subjects and volumes of the amygdala, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, caudate, pallidum, putamen, and thalamus were measured using FreeSurfer. Results Patients with BP showed a global reduction of deep gray matter volumes compared to HCs. However, childhood trauma modulated the impact of the diagnosis specifically on the amygdala and hippocampus. Childhood trauma was associated with bilateral decreased volumes in HCs and increased volumes in patients with BP. Conclusions The results suggest that childhood trauma may have a different effect in health and disease on volumes of gray matter in the amygdala and hippocampus, which are brain areas specifically involved in response to stress and emotion processing.

AB  - Abstract Aim To determine the role of levator ani trauma in anal incontinence (AI), whilst controlling for anal sphincter injury. Methods The records of 1273 patients who had attended a tertiary urogynaecology unit between 1st of January to 31st December 2016 were reviewed. AI was assessed using St Mark's score and visual analogue scale (VAS). Levator muscle and anal sphincter trauma were examined by translabial ultrasound using tomographic imaging, with archived data sets investigated blinded against all clinical data. A complete avulsion was diagnosed if at least three central tomographic slices showed an abnormal muscle insertion, rated separately for each side. A significant anal sphincter defect was diagnosed if at least four out of six slices showed a defect of ≥ 30°. Results Avulsion was associated with St Mark's score (P = 0.005) and VAS bother of AI (P = 0.022) both on univariate analysis and when controlling for external anal sphincter (EAS) trauma on translabial imaging, forceps, body mass index (BMI) and age (P = 0.011 and P = 0.04, respectively). AI expressed as a binary variable was significantly associated with avulsion on univariate analysis (P = 0.011), although the association became nonsignificant after controlling for anal sphincter trauma, age, BMI and forceps delivery (P = 0.084). Conclusion In this retrospective observational study, we found a weak association between levator ani avulsion and measures of AI, which largely remained significant when controlling for anal sphincter trauma. However, given the large data set, any clinical effect of levator trauma on AI is likely to be minor.

AB  - Abstract Background The Trauma Pod (TP) vision is to develop a rapidly deployable robotic system to perform critical acute stabilization and/or surgical procedures, autonomously or in a teleoperative mode, on wounded soldiers in the battlefield who might otherwise die before treatment in a combat hospital could be provided. Methods In the first phase of a project pursuing this vision, a robotic TP system was developed and its capability demonstrated by performing selected surgical procedures on a patient phantom. Results The system demonstrates the feasibility of performing acute stabilization procedures with the patient being the only human in the surgical cell. The teleoperated surgical robot is supported by autonomous robotic arms and subsystems that carry out scrub-nurse and circulating-nurse functions. Tool change and supply delivery are performed automatically and at least as fast as performed manually by nurses. Tracking and counting of the supplies is performed automatically. The TP system also includes a tomographic X-ray facility for patient diagnosis and two-dimensional (2D) fluoroscopic data to support interventions. The vast amount of clinical protocols generated in the TP system are recorded automatically. Conclusions Automation and teleoperation capabilities form the basis for a more comprehensive acute diagnostic and management platform that will provide life-saving care in environments where surgical personnel are not present.

AB  - Summary Traumatic accidents are responsible for almost half of deaths of children between the ages of 1 and 14 years. Motor vehicles are most commonly involved, with pedestrian accidents being a leading cause in the 5?9-year age group. Injuries to the urinary tract and associated complications remain a source of significant morbidity following trauma in the pediatric age group. The kidney is also the most commonly injured abdominal organ in children. This chapter reviews the presentation and evaluation of pediatric traumatic injuries of the kidney and evaluates current treatment options. The current evolving literature on nonoperative management of even high-grade renal injuries is reviewed. Ureteral and bladder trauma will also be reviewed.

AB  - Abstract. Objective: To assess the effect of esmolol vs lidocaine to attenuate the detrimental rise in heart rate and blood pressure during intubation of patients with isolated head trauma. Methods: This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized study, performed at an urban, county teaching emergency department. Participants were 30 patients with isolated head trauma. Each underwent a standardized intubation protocol including esmolol or lidocaine, both at 2 mg/kg. Results: Esmolol was used in 16 patients and lidocaine in 14. Mechanisms of injury included 12 assaults, 6 motor vehicle collisions, 6 falls, 4 auto-vs-pedestrian crashes, and 2 bicycle incidents. Mean ethanol level was 0.116 ± 0.133 SD (range 0-0.482). Mean Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 7.9 ± 4.0 SD. Cranial computed tomography (CT) hemorrhagic findings included 9 subdural/epidural hematomas, 6 cortex hemorrhages, and 2 multi-hemorrhages. Eleven patients received surgical intervention: 9 patients received a craniotomy, and 2 a ventricular catheter. The 2-minute time interval around intubation was used to assess each drug's efficacy. The mean difference change between groups for heart rate was 4.0 beats/min (95% CI = -17.7 to 9.7 beats/min), for systolic blood pressure was 1.3 mm Hg (95% CI = -27.8 to 30.4 mm Hg), and for diastolic blood pressure was 2.6 mm Hg (95% CI = -27.1 to 21.9 mm Hg). The power of this study was 90% to detect a 20-beat/min difference in heart rate, a 35-mm Hg difference in systolic blood pressure, and a 20-mm Hg difference in diastolic blood pressure. Conclusions: Esmolol and lidocaine have similar efficacies to attenuate moderate hemodynamic response to intubation of patients with isolated head trauma.
