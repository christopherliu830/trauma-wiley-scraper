AB  - Abstract Indigenous women are subjected to high rates of multiple forms of violence, including intimate partner violence (IPV), in the context of ongoing colonization and neo-colonization. Health promotion interventions for women who experience violence have not been tailored specifically for Indigenous women. Reclaiming Our Spirits (ROS) is a health promotion intervention designed for Indigenous women living in an urban context in Canada. In this paper, we describe the development of the intervention, results of a pilot study, and the revised subsequent intervention. Building on a theory-based health promotion intervention (iHEAL) showing promising results in feasibility studies, ROS was developed using a series of related approaches including (a) guidance from Indigenous women with research expertise specific to IPV and Indigenous women's experiences; (b) articulation of an Indigenous lens, including using Cree (one of the largest Indigenous language groups in North America) concepts to identify key aspects; and (c) interviews with Elders (n?=?10) living in the study setting. Offered over 6?8 months, ROS consists of a Circle, led by an Indigenous Elder, and 1:1 visits with a Registered Nurse, focused on six areas for health promotion derived from previous research. Pilot testing with Indigenous women (n?=?21) produced signs of improvement in most measures of health from pre- to post-intervention. Women found the pilot intervention acceptable and helpful but also offered valuable suggestions for improvement. A revised intervention, with greater structure within the Circle and nurses with stronger knowledge of Indigenous women's experience and community health, is currently undergoing testing. ? 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Abstract Recent advances in molecular genetics are making it increasingly feasible to construct individual genetic profiles predicting susceptibility to heart disease, cancer and respiratory disorders. This paper reviews current knowledge about the social and cultural impact of providing people with information relating to their risk for future disease, focusing not only on currently available predictive genetic testing but also on hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and cancer screening. We highlight the importance of issues of probability and uncertainty, and the tension between collective and individual goals in the assessment of medical risk. We conclude with a proposed research agenda for studies of the social and cultural impact of predictive genetic testing, and argue that there is a pressing need for rigorous, empirical, social research in this area.

AB  - Severe Traumatic brain injury (sTBI) often instigates widespread long-lasting disability and is accompanied by extensive rehabilitation. Unsurprisingly, sTBI also holds malignant consequences for patients? close relatives. The burden caused by the injury and its severity explains some of the ramifications for the relatives. Additionally, some findings demonstrate that patients with sTBI and their relatives develop posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms. However, although the link between PTS symptoms and physical and mental health is well-documented in literature, the effect of PTS symptoms on relatives of patients with sTBI has barely been examined. This study examines the influence of PTS symptoms of patients with sTBI and their relatives on the physical and mental health and functioning of the relatives. Patients who sustained a severe sTBI (Abbreviated Injury Scale of the head region > 3) and close relatives were included in a multi-center, prospective cohort study (TRAST-MI). One-hundred patients and their relatives were assessed at 2, 6, and 12 months post injury. Outcome variables included health-related quality of life (SF-12) as well as emotional, cognitive, interpersonal, and total functioning (PCRS). Relatives? physical health was predicted by relatives? PTS symptoms (Slope=?1.76; p = .043), and mental health was predicted by both patients? (Slope=?2.77; p = .034) and relatives? (Slope=?6.59; p < .001) PTS symptoms. Functioning level was only predicted by patients? PTS symptoms (Slope=?.25; p<.001). The findings emphasize that TBI should be considered a comprehensive traumatic experience reaching further than mere physical damage to the brain and its direct consequences, affecting the injured individual and close relatives.

AB  - The aim of this study was to prove the effectiveness of MatriDerm? combined with skin grafting versus skin grafting alone in post-traumatic wounds treatment. At the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, we treated 60 patients: 30 patients with dermal substitutes (MatriDerm?) combined with autologous skin graft and 30 with skin graft alone. Two weeks after the first treatment, 95% of wounds treated with MatriDerm? and skin graft showed a re-epithelisation, whereas it was 75?80% in the control group. We used the Manchester Scar Scale (MSS) and patient's self-estimation scale to assess the outcomes. Mann?Whitney U test was performed for the five items of the MSS and the results were combined to those of patient's self-estimation scale and the re-epithelialisation percentage to test the significance between the two groups. These data confirm the evidence of the clinical use of MatriDerm? technology in the healing of soft tissue wounds and prove the effectiveness of combining MatriDerm? and skin grafting for the first time. Furthermore, we observed a percentage reduction of wound contraction and in the same time an improvement of elasticity, quality of scars tissue and dermal architecture.

AB  - ABSTRACT Effective, patient-centered communication facilitates interception and correction of potentially harmful conditions and errors. All team members, including women, their families, physicians, midwives, nurses, and support staff, have roles in identifying the potential for harm during labor and birth. However, the results of collaborative research studies conducted by organizations that represent professionals who care for women during labor and birth indicate that health care providers may frequently witness, but may not always report, problems with safety or clinical performance. Some of these health care providers felt resigned to the continuation of such problems and fearful of retribution if they tried to address them. Speaking up to address safety and quality concerns is a dynamic social process. Every team member must feel empowered to speak up about concerns without fear of put-downs, retribution, or receiving poor-quality care. Patient safety requires mutual accountability: individuals, teams, health care facilities, and professional associations have a shared responsibility for creating and sustaining environments of mutual respect and engaging in highly reliable perinatal care. Defects in human factors, communication, and leadership have been the leading contributors to sentinel events in perinatal care for more than a decade. Organizational commitment and executive leadership are essential to creating an environment that proactively supports safety and quality. The problem is well-known; the time for action is now.

AB  - Each year, exposure to violent trauma takes its toll on the development of millions of children. When their trauma goes unaddressed, children are at greater risk for school failure; anxiety and depression and other post-traumatic disorders; alcohol and drug abuse, and, later in life, engaging in violence similar to that to which they were originally exposed. In spite of the serious psychiatric/developmental sequelae of violence exposure, the majority of severely and chronically traumatized children and youth are not found in mental health clinics. Instead, they typically are seen as the ?trouble-children? in schools or emerge in the child protective, law enforcement, substance abuse treatment, and criminal justice systems, where the root of their problems in exposure to violence and abuse is typically not identified or addressed. Usually, providers in all of these diverse service systems have not been sufficiently trained to know and identify the traumatic origins of the children's presenting difficulties and are not sufficiently equipped to assist with their remediation. This multiplicity of traumatic manifestations outside the mental health setting leads to the inescapable conclusion that we are dealing with a supra-clinical problem that can only be resolved by going beyond the child's individual clinical needs to enlist a range of coordinated services for the child and the family. This paper will focus on domestic violence as a paradigmatic source of violent traumatization and will (a) describe the impact and consequences of exposure to violence on children's immediate and long-term development; (b) examine the opportunities for, as well as the barriers to, bridging the clinical phenomena of children's violent trauma and the existing systems of care that might best meet their needs; and (c) critique current national policies that militate against a more rational and coherent approach to addressing these needs.

AB  - Abstract Background The aim of the present study was to report the clinicopathologic, radiographic and immunohistochemical features of five South American cases of intraosseous xanthomas of the mandible and to compare them to those detected in a literature review. Methods Clinical data were collected from the records of three Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology services in South America and compared with those compiled from a literature review based on a search of three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus). All cases were evaluated by haematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry for CD68 and S-100. Results The series comprised four females (80%) and one male (20%) with a mean age of 23.3 ± 10.9 years (range: 13-45 years). In four cases, there was involvement of the posterior region of the mandible (80%). The lesions presented radiographically as unilocular (60%) radiolucencies with punched-out margin (80%). All cases predominantly consisted of CD68-positive and S-100-negative xanthomatous cells. No recurrences were observed after curettage, with a median follow-up of 27 months. Conclusion Intraosseous xanthoma of the jaws is a rare benign disorder. We report here five additional cases affecting the mandible, for a total of 36 cases of the jaws reported in the literature. Overall, this lesion has predilection for posterior sites of the mandible of asymptomatic young adults.

AB  - Medical Education 2010: 44: 1016?1026 Context? Burnout is prevalent among medical students and is a predictor of subsequent serious consideration of dropping out of medical school and suicide ideation. Understanding of the factors that protect against burnout is needed to guide student wellness programmes. Methods? A total of 1321 medical students attending five institutions were studied longitudinally (2006?2007). The surveys included standardised instruments to evaluate burnout, quality of life, fatigue and stress. Additional items explored social support, learning climate, life events, employment status and demographics. Students who did not have burnout at either time-point (resilient students) were compared with those who indicated burnout at one or both time-points (vulnerable students) using a Wilcoxon?Mann?Whitney test or Fisher?s exact test. Similarly, the differences between those who recovered and those who were chronically burned out were also compared in students with burnout at the first time-point. Logistic regression modelling was employed to evaluate associations between the independent variables and resiliency to and recovery from burnout. Results? Overall, 792 (60.0%) students completed the burnout inventory at both time-points. No differences in demographic characteristics were observed between resilient (290/792 [36.6%]) and vulnerable (502/792 [63.4%]) students. Resilient students were less likely to experience depression, had a higher quality of life, were less likely to be employed, had experienced fewer stressful life events, reported higher levels of social support, perceived their learning climate more positively and experienced less stress and fatigue (all p?<?0.05) than vulnerable students. On multivariable analysis, perceiving student education as a priority for faculty staff, experiencing less stress, not being employed and being a minority were factors independently associated with recovery from burnout. Conclusions? Modifiable individual factors and learning climate characteristics including employment status, stress level and perceptions of the prioritising of student education by faculty members relate to medical students? vulnerability to burnout.

AB  - Abstract We investigated the relationship between serum cystatin C levels and the prognosis of diabetic foot ulcerations (DFU). A population-based cohort study involving 1018 patients with type 2 diabetes was conducted. These patients recruited and divided into two groups: nondiabetic foot ulcer group (NDF, n?=?865, 85.5%) and diabetic foot ulcer group (DFU, n?=?147, 14.5%).After a 1-year-follow-up, DFUs were grouped into healing (n?=?110, 74.8%) and nonhealing (n?=?37, 25.2%) group based on the clinical prognosis. Compared with the healing group, the nonhealing group were older, had long diabetic duration and had significantly increased serum cystatin C concentrations in DFU (p?<?0.01). After adjustments for age, diabetes duration, renal function and infection control, multiple logistical regression analysis revealed that cystatin C remained associated increased risk of undesirable DFU outcome (OR?=?7.279, 95% CI: 1.299?40.784, p?<?0.05). When divided into quartiles according to cystatin C levels, the healing rate of Quartile 4 was significantly lower (57.9%) compared with other groups (p?<?0.01). The odd is ratio (OR) analysis showed that the risk of undesirable DFU outcome in Quartile 4 was significantly higher (OR?=?4.554, 95% CI: 3.14?5.12, p?<?0.05) compared with that in Quartile 1. We concluded that there was a strong and independent association between serum cystatin C and diabetic foot ulceration prognosis, cystatin C?>?1.35 mg/L predicts more than sixfold increased risk of incurable foot ulceration.

AB  - Abstract Aim: The aim of this study was to describe a service operating in Milan, Italy, that provides early intervention for young people aged 17?30?years at the onset and at high risk of psychosis. Method: Following 2?years of preliminary study and organization, Programma2000 was launched in Milan in 1999. This programme was targeted at early detection and intervention in subjects at the onset of, at risk of, or showing ?prodromal? signs of psychosis. This paper contains data on the organization and activities of Programma2000. Results: The service has been active since its launch and has received 378 referrals as of March 2009, 342 of which were thoroughly evaluated. At entry, patients undergo a detailed evaluation of their psychopathology, personal and social role functioning, and cognitive status, with repeated testing over time in order to multidimensionally assess outcome. Treatment involves cognitive?behavioural psychotherapy, structured and unstructured psychosocial interventions, and pharmacotherapy when deemed necessary. Treatment appears effective in reducing morbidity and improving social functioning. Conclusion: A team dedicated to the early identification and treatment of young people with early psychosis is a feasible and sustainable extension of the traditional methods of care for people with mental disorders in Italy.

AB  - Summary Background The GlideScope Cobalt Video laryngoscope is being used more often in children with challenging laryngoscopy. There are, however, no pediatric trials comparing it to flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy, the current accepted gold standard. This preliminary manikin study compares the first-attempt intubation success of the GlideScope Cobalt video laryngoscope to the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope when performed by attending pediatric anesthesiologists at two major pediatric centers. Methods This prospective randomized, crossover study evaluated 120 attempts (60 with each study device) to intubate the AirSim Pierre Robin manikin (PRM) with fiberoptic bronchoscopy and video laryngoscopy (VL). Attending pediatric anesthesiologists from two quaternary pediatric centers were eligible to participate. Each attending anesthesiologist randomly performed a single tracheal intubation attempt with one of the study devices followed by the alternate method. The primary outcome was the first-attempt success rate of tracheal intubation. Blinding was not feasible. We hypothesized that first-attempt success would be higher with fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Results Thirty anesthesiologists from each center were randomized to use one of the study devices followed by the alternate method. We analyzed all participants' data. There was no overall difference in first-attempt success between VL and fiberoptic bronchoscopy (88.3% vs 85% respectively, P = 0.59). There were significant institutional differences in first-attempt success using VL (76.7% vs 100%). Conclusions There was no difference in first-attempt success of tracheal intubation using VL vs fiberoptic bronchoscopy when performed by attending anesthesiologists at two large pediatric centers. However, institutional differences exist in success rates with VL across the two centers. Results from single-center device evaluations should be verified by multi-center evaluations. A significant proportion of attending anesthesiologists lack experience with advanced airway devices; targeted education may enhance intubation success and patient safety.

AB  - BACKGROUND The use of male-donor-predominant plasma has reduced the risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), but the possible benefit of different mitigation strategies for other components is unknown. We evaluated the risk of TRALI from apheresis platelets (PLTs) to predict the effect of selectively testing female plateletpheresis donors who have been pregnant for HLA antibodies. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The American Red Cross hemovigilance program classified TRALI cases from apheresis PLTs or red blood cells (RBCs) in 2006 to 2013 or from predominantly male-donor (>95%) plasma in 2008 to 2013 and compared the component-specific TRALI rates. RESULTS The overall rate of TRALI was significantly higher for apheresis PLTs (6.2 cases per 106 units; OR [95% CI], 3.3 [2.3-4.8]) or plasma (3.8 cases per 106 units; OR [95% CI], 2.0 [1.4-2.9]) compared to RBCs (1.9 per 106 units). Twenty-nine of the 41 apheresis PLT cases involved female donors; 28 had been pregnant, and one had not been pregnant and was not tested. Twenty-five (61%) of the apheresis PLT TRALI cases had female donors with HLA Class I or Class II antibodies. In five of six cases that implicated specific HNA antibodies, the female parous donors also had multiple HLA antibodies. CONCLUSIONS TRALI was more likely after transfusion of apheresis PLTs than male-donor-predominant plasma or RBCs. A selective strategy to test all female plateletpheresis donors who have been pregnant for HLA antibodies might reduce the risk of TRALI by approximately 60% and prevent some cases from coexisting HNA antibodies.

AB  - Abstract: Treatment of pain is one of the major challenges in clinical medicine. However, it is often difficult to evaluate the effect of a treatment, as the many symptoms of the underlying diseases often confound this assessment. Furthermore, as the pain mechanisms in many diseases are poorly understood, the limited successful trial and error approach is most often used in the selection of analgesics. Hence, there is a need for new methods in the characterization and treatment of pain. Human experimental pain models offer the possibility to explore the pain system under controlled settings. The models can also be used to screen the analgesic profiles of drugs targeted to treat pain. This review gives a brief introduction to the methods used to evoke and assess pain in the skin, muscle and viscera. New methods using multimodal stimulation and activation of central pain mechanisms can to a higher degree mimic the clinical situation, and such methods are recommended in the future screening of analgesics. Examples of the use of experimental pain models in the testing of analgesics are given. With these models the therapeutic spectrum may be defined from a differentiated knowledge on the effect of drugs on the pain system. Such information may be used in the future guidelines for trials and clinical use of analgesics.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of acquired disability globally, and effective treatment methods are scarce. Lately, there has been increasing recognition of the devastating impact of TBI resulting from sports and other recreational activities, ranging from primarily sport-related concussions (SRC) but also more severe brain injuries requiring hospitalization. There are currently no established treatments for the underlying pathophysiology in TBI and while neuro-rehabilitation efforts are promising, there are currently is a lack of consensus regarding rehabilitation following TBI of any severity. In this narrative review, we highlight short- and long-term consequences of SRCs, and how the sideline management of these patients should be performed. We also cover the basic concepts of neuro-critical care management for more severely brain-injured patients with a focus on brain oedema and the necessity of improving intracranial conditions in terms of substrate delivery in order to facilitate recovery and improve outcome. Further, following the acute phase, promising new approaches to rehabilitation are covered for both patients with severe TBI and athletes suffering from SRC. These highlight the need for co-ordinated interdisciplinary rehabilitation, with a special focus on cognition, in order to promote recovery after TBI.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the current recommendations for the care of the seriously injured polytraumatized small animal patient, including team organization and facility readiness; scene assessment and care; transport; and hospital assessment and care. Data sources: Original research articles, scientific reviews, book chapters, and clinical experience. Human data synthesis: The care of the seriously injured patient is demanding and requires adequate preparation, rapid access to organized resources and equipment, and skilled personnel. Second in urgency only to stabilization of the airway and breathing is shock. In many, surgical intervention to provide improved and continued stability is required. Evidence is provided by data published comparing survival for humans with high injury scores being cared for at level I trauma centers compared with small rural hospitals. Personal experience as a member of an emergency medical team in the care of multiple injured human patients in both level I trauma centers and small hospitals is also used in this review. Veterinary data synthesis: Publications reporting large clinical series of seriously injured dogs and cats are minimal. Experimental animal models of shock caused by blood loss and the study of various organ injuries and their management are numerous. These and 35 years of the author's experience in managing severely injured dogs and cats (estimated to be >750) is also used in this review for generation of guidelines. Conclusions: Guidelines for care of severe multiple injury patients are presented and are recommended to be used in clinical veterinary medical practice to improve outcome.

AB  - ABSTRACT Contemporary theories of borderline personality disorder (BPD) have detailed the functional importance of emotional invalidation in meaningful relationships as an aetiological and perpetuating factor of its core disturbances. The purpose of our study was to test aspects of Linehan's (1993) biosocial and Fruzzetti (1996) and Fruzzetti, Shenk, and Hoffman's (2005) validation/invalidation family interactions transactional theories in a community sample of 186 participants. Results indicated that a multi-mediational path model of invalidation in meaningful relationships, emotion dysregulation, poor distress tolerance and BPD symptoms provided a perfect fit to the data and accounted for a substantial amount of variance in BPD (38%). The results provided support for these complimentary theories of BPD, which hold promise for clinical applications and future research. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract The use of ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to data independent tandem mass spectrometry with traveling wave ion mobility for detection and structural identification of ether-linked glycerophosphoethanolamine is described. The experimental design generates 4D data (chromatographic retention time, precursor accurate mass, drift time with associated calculated collisional cross-section, and time-aligned accurate mass diagnostic product ions) for each ionization mode. Confident structure identification depends on satisfying 4D data confirmation in both positive and negative ion mode. Using this methodology, a number of ether-linked glycerophosphoethanolamine lipids are structurally elucidated from mouse brain lysosomes. It is further determined that several ether-linked glycerophosphoethanolamine structures are differentially abundant between lysosomes isolated from mouse cortex following traumatic brain injury as compared to that of sham animals. The combined effort of aligning multi-dimensional mass spectrometry data with a well-defined traumatic brain injury model lays the foundation for gaining mechanistic insight in the role lysosomal membrane damage plays in neuronal cell death following brain injury.
