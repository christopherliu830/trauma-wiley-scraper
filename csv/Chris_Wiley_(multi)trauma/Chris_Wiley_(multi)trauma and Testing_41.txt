AB  - Background Small pigtail catheters appear to work as well as the traditional large-bore chest tubes in patients with traumatic pneumothorax, but it is not known whether the smaller pigtail catheters are associated with less tube-site pain. This study was conducted to compare tube-site pain following pigtail catheter or chest tube insertion in patients with uncomplicated traumatic pneumothorax. Methods This prospective randomized trial compared 14-Fr pigtail catheters and 28-Fr chest tubes in patients with traumatic pneumothorax presenting to a level I trauma centre from July 2010 to February 2012. Patients who required emergency tube placement, those who refused and those who could not respond to pain assessment were excluded. Primary outcomes were tube-site pain, as assessed by a numerical rating scale, and total pain medication use. Secondary outcomes included the success rate of pneumothorax resolution and insertion-related complications. Results Forty patients were enrolled. Baseline characteristics of 20 patients in the pigtail catheter group were similar to those of 20 patients in the chest tube group. No patient had a flail chest or haemothorax. Pain scores related to chest wall trauma were similar in the two groups. Patients with a pigtail catheter had significantly lower mean(s.d.) tube-site pain scores than those with a chest tube, at baseline after tube insertion (3·2(0·6) versus 7·7(0·6); P < 0·001), on day 1 (1·9(0·5) versus 6·2(0·7); P < 0·001) and day 2 (2·1(1.1) versus 5·5(1·0); P = 0·040). The decreased use of pain medication associated with pigtail catheter was not significantly different. The duration of tube insertion, success rate and insertion-related complications were all similar in the two groups. Conclusion For patients with a simple, uncomplicated traumatic pneumothorax, use of a 14-Fr pigtail catheter is associated with reduced pain at the site of insertion, with no other clinically important differences noted compared with chest tubes.

AB  - Background:? Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in infancy is relatively common, and is likely to lead to poorer outcomes than injuries sustained later in childhood. While the headlines have been grabbed by infant TBI caused by abuse, often known as shaken baby syndrome, the evidence base for how to support children following TBI in infancy is thin. These children are likely to benefit from ongoing assessment and intervention, because brain injuries sustained in the first year of life can influence development in different ways over many years. Methods:? A literature search was conducted and drawn together into a review aimed at informing practitioners working with children who had a brain injury in infancy. As there are so few evidence-based studies specifically looking at children who have sustained a TBI in infancy, ideas are drawn from a range of studies, including different age ranges and difficulties other than traumatic brain injury. Results:? This paper outlines the issues around measuring outcomes for children following TBI in the first year of life. An explanation of outcomes which are more likely for children following TBI in infancy is provided, in the areas of mortality; convulsions; endocrine problems; sensory and motor skills; cognitive processing; language; academic attainments; executive functions; and psychosocial difficulties. The key factors influencing these outcomes are then set out, including severity of injury; pre-morbid situation; genetics; family factors and interventions. Conclusions:? Practitioners need to take a long-term, developmental view when assessing, understanding and supporting children who have sustained a TBI in their first year of life. The literature suggests some interventions which may be useful in prevention, acute care and longer-term rehabilitation, and further research is needed to assess their effectiveness.

AB  - Summary The physiological derangements that are frequently witnessed in the heartbeating brainstem-dead multiorgan donor are a result of both the adverse somatic consequences of treatment strategies for acute catastrophic brain injury as well as the well-described and specific consequences of brainstem ischaemia. The latter include diabetes insipidus, hypothermia, cardiovascular instability, neurogenic pulmonary oedema and systemic inflammation, and together they jeopardise the donation potential of the brainstem-dead donor. Donor management protocols are designed to help clinical staff detect and reverse these various derangements and require a continuation, and on occasion escalation, of physiological monitoring and support on the intensive-care unit. By increasing the number and quality of organs that are available for transplantation, physiological optimisation more completely fulfils the altruistic gift being made by the donor and their family, and should therefore be seen as an important component of the donor's end of life care.

AB  - ABSTRACT Knee injuries cause structural damage and acute inflammation that initiates the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4), a member of a family of enzymes that generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays a pivotal role in normal development of the musculoskeletal system, but may increase ROS production to harmful levels after joint injury. The role of ROS in both normal joint homeostasis and injury is poorly understood, but inhibition of excessive ROS production by Nox4 after joint injury could be protective to the joint, decreasing oxidative stress, and initiation of PTOA. Knee injuries were simulated using inflammatory cytokines in cultured primary human chondrocytes and a non-invasive mouse model of PTOA in C57BL/6N and Nox4 knockout mice. There is an acute decrease in Nox4 activity within 24?h after injury in both systems, followed by a subsequent sustained low-level increase, a novel finding not seen in any other system. Inhibition of Nox4 activity by GKT137831 was protective against early structural changes after non-invasive knee injury in a mouse model. Nox4 knockout mice had significant differences in structural and mechanical properties of bone, providing further evidence for the role of Nox4 in development of joint tissues and biochemical response after joint injury. Nox4 plays a significant role in the acute phase after joint injury, and targeted inhibition of inflammation caused by Nox4 may be protective against early joint changes in the pathogenesis of PTOA. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Summary Background Decline in high speed treadmill (HSTM) exercise testing may be attributed to the rise of over-ground endoscopy and telemetric electrocardiography, in addition to concerns of adverse events during treadmill exercise resulting in injury or inadequate testing. Objectives To describe adverse events occurring during HSTM exercise tests at a single institution and determine their effect on likelihood of completing diagnostic HSTM exercise testing. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods Pearson?s chi-square test was used to determine if a significant difference in frequencies of adverse events existed between complete and incomplete HSTM exercise tests. Two Firth logistic regression models were used to determine likelihood of exercise test completion given the presence of any adverse event, and the likelihood of exercise test completion for each type of adverse event. Results The majority of horses presenting for HSTM evaluation underwent exercise testing (900/1003; 90%). Eight-hundred and seven (90%) exercise tests were completed. Adverse events occurred in 136 (15%) HSTM exercise tests of which 97 (71%) did not impact ability to complete HSTM testing. Adverse events significantly but variably decreased the likelihood of HSTM exercise test completion. Sixty-six percent of incomplete exercise tests were prematurely terminated due to poor performance abnormalities during which diagnosis of poor performance cause(s) was still achieved. Main limitations Variable personnel recorded data over the study period. Per-test rather than per-horse evaluation does not account for the effect of multiple training and testing episodes performed in the same horse. Conclusions This study supports the continued usage of HSTM exercise testing for examination of horses with poor performance, with adverse events occurring infrequently. Adverse events reduced the likelihood of completing HSTM exercise testing although not all adverse events affected likelihood of completion similarly. In many cases, a performance limiting problem was identified for horses in which an exercise test was considered incomplete. The Summary is available in Spanish ? see Supporting information

AB  - Abstract Ethnoracial minority status contributes to an increased risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after trauma exposure, beyond other risk factors. A population-based sampling frame was used to examine the associations between ethnoracial groups and early PTSD symptoms while adjusting for relevant clinical and demographic characteristics. Acutely injured trauma center inpatients (N = 623) were screened with the PTSD Checklist. American Indian and African American patients reported the highest levels of posttraumatic stress and preinjury cumulative trauma burden. African American heritage was independently associated with an increased risk of higher acute PTSD symptom levels. Disparities in trauma history, PTSD symptoms, and event related factors emphasize the need for acute care services to incorporate culturally competent approaches for treating these diverse populations.

AB  - Background The prognostic value of early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in dogs after traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains unclear. Objectives Determine whether MRI findings are associated with prognosis after TBI in dogs. Animals Fifty client-owned dogs. Methods Retrospective study of dogs with TBI that underwent 1.5T MRI within 14 days after head trauma. MRI evaluators were blinded to the clinical presentation, and all images were scored based on an MRI grading system (Grade I [normal brain parenchyma] to Grade VI [bilateral lesions affecting the brainstem with or without any lesions of lesser grade]). Skull fractures, percentage of intraparenchymal lesions, degree of midline shift, and type of brain herniation were evaluated. MGCS was assessed at presentation. The presence of seizures was recorded. Outcome was assessed at 48 h (alive or dead) and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after TBI. Results Sixty-six percent of the dogs had abnormal MRI findings. MRI grade was negatively correlated (P < .001) with MGCS. A significant negative correlation of MRI grade, degree of midline shift, and percentage of intraparenchymal lesions with follow-up scores was identified. The MGCS was lower in dogs with brain herniation (P = .0191). Follow-up scores were significantly lower in dogs that had brain herniation or skull fractures. The possibility of having seizures was associated with higher percentage of intraparenchymal lesions (P = 0.0054) and 10% developed PTE. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Significant associations exist between MRI findings and prognosis in dogs with TBI. MRI can help to predict prognosis in dogs with TBI.

AB  - Abstract Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has become a major disease that threatens human health. Neurotransmitters and the amygdala are found to be critical in the development and maintenance of PTSD. We aim to investigate the role of glycyrrhizin in treating PTSD. Contextual fear extinction and elevated plus maze test were applied to evaluate the anxiety and fear memory. Microdialysis and high-performance liquid chromatography were used to analyze the expression of amygdala neurotransmitters in PTSD animal models and to verify the effects of glycyrrhizin on major neurotransmitters. The protein levels of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) were examined by western bolt. Glycyrrhizin treatment significantly reduced anxiety and fear memory after 1 and 7 days of PTSD modelling. In addition, glycyrrhizin treatment restored the circadian rhythm changes of serotonin and TPH2. The present study found a significant circadian rhythm change of serotonin in the amygdala in PTSD rats. Besides, glycyrrhizin treatment restored the altered serotonin diurnal fluctuations, which raises important implications for PTSD treatment.

AB  - SUMMARY Recently it has been demonstrated that the CD14 molecule which is expressed on monocytes and macrophages serves as a receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) bound to LPS-binding protein (LBP) and thus mediates LPS-induced tumour necrosis factor (TNF) production. Here we report that CD14 is found as a soluble (s) molecule in serum. In healthy volunteers sCD14 levels (mean ± s.e.m.) were 3.7±0.05 ?g/ml (n= 30, 25?50 years of age) as determined by ELISA (detection limit 20 ?g/ml serum) using two monoclonal antibodies in a sandwich technique. In polytraumatized patients (n= 16) significantly decreased levels (1.7 ± 0.3) were detected immediately after the trauma, which increased to 4.9±0.3 ?g/ml within the first 6 days post trauma. sCD14 remained elevated during the first 14 days post trauma in patients with the most severe injuries (injury severity score > 45 points), whereas a return to normal levels was observed in patients with an injury score of < 45 points. In addition, the levels of the high-density lipoproteins that partially inactivate free endotoxin are significantly decreased post trauma. No correlation between parameters of inflammation (C3a and neopterin levels, leucocyte counts, amount of band cells), liver function and sCD14 levels was established. Comparable to polytraumatized patients, increased sCD14 serum levels were observed in five patients with burn trauma (burned area > 35%) within the second week post trauma when clinical signs of septicaemia were evident.

AB  - Support from an intimate partner predicts recovery in individuals who have survived a traumatic injury, but not all partners are willing or able to provide support. To account for support provision after a traumatic injury, both members of 58 young couples were interviewed shortly after one member experienced a traumatic injury. Characteristics of the situation, the support recipient, and the support provider accounted for unique variance in support provision. Specifically, partners of trauma survivors reported providing more support when the injury was more severe, they were more religious, and their partners were higher in neuroticism. Contrary to expectations, no relationship variables were significantly associated with support provision. Results highlight the need to examine predictors of support in real-world contexts.

(1) Center group: 165 patients operated on in six medical centers participating in a cooperative study; (2) Noncenter group, sufficient data available: 203 patients operated on by surgeons with experience limited to a few cases; (3) Nonstudy group, minimal data available: 109 patients operated on as in group 2; vital statistics only were contributed. The protocol for data gathering was comprised of 154 major variables. Basic data on age, sex, diagnosis and etiology were analyzed for homogenicity of data among the groups. A comprehensive analysis of the pacing methods, complication and results fom the Center group yielded information on the early experience with diaphragm pacing important to its future application.

AB  - Iodopropynylbutyl carbamate (IPBC)is a preservative that has been increasingly used for skin care products and cosmetics within the last years and the first cases of contact sensitization have meanwhile been reported. Therefore, a surveillance for IPBC contact allergy is now necessary. Our study was aimed to find out a suitable test concentration of IPBC for this purpose. The data 8106 patients tested by 23 centres of the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG) and the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK)in the time from May 2001 to July 2003 with IPBC in concentrations of 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, and 0.5% were retrospectively evaluated. Criteria considered to determine the optimal test concentration of IPBC were the reaction index, the positivity ratio, the rate of crescendo reactions, and the relation of IPBC-reactions with MOAHLFA-indices, with irritant reactions to sodium lauryl sulfate, and with positive reactions to the most common standard contact allergens and 4 other preservatives. For statistical evaluations the exact McNemar test was applied and odds ratios were calculated according to the profile likelihood method, as derived from logistic regression analyses. The rate of positive reactions to IPBC increased from 0.5% with IPBC 0.1% to 1.7% with IPBC 0.5%, but there was a problem with sensitivity or specificity with both of these 2 concentrations. Therefore, we focused on IPBC 0.2%(0.8% positive reactions) and IPBC 0.3%(1.3% positive reactions) for further detailed analyses. An evaluation of the related parameters revealed that with IPBC 0.2% as compared to IPBC 0.3% a higher percentage of crescendo reactions, a higher reaction index, a lower number of doubtful reactions, a plausible association of positive reactions with reactions to other preservatives, nd no association with a pronounced skin irritability was found. In conclusion, we recommend to start with IPBC 0.2% for patch testing of all persons with contact dermatitis that may be related to preservatives.

The clinical team shares what they did, what was learned, the questions raised, and preliminary evaulations about the multiple family meeting that were the major intervention. Because of the vast diversity, training of therapists and interventions for families aimed for cultural competence. The community-based approach, preferred by union families, plus family therapy using the lens of ambiguous loss are proposed as necessary additions to disaster work.

AB  - Objectives Blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI) is a known sequela of high-energy craniomaxillofacial (CMF) trauma and can result in stroke or death. The objective of this systematic review is to 1) identify CMF trauma patients who may benefit from BCVI screening and 2) describe the optimal diagnostic and treatment modalities. Study Design Systematic review of the literature (1946?2013). Methods An a priori study protocol was created using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis. The authors conducted a search of Ovid/Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane databases for articles related to BCVI and CMF fractures. All abstracts were reviewed, and data was extracted to determine the incidence of BCVI in the setting of CMF trauma. Individual fracture patterns were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results Twenty-one studies met inclusion criteria. The overall incidence of CMF fracture-associated BCVI was 0.45%. The majority of patients (86.6%) sustained BCVI in the setting of high-energy trauma. The distribution of CMF fractures among BCVI patients was the mandible (12.5%), followed by the maxilla (11.8%). Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) was the most common diagnostic modality. A total of 63.1% of patients with BCVI were managed medically. The mortality among CMF patients with BCVI was 23.9%, and stroke rate was 47.1%. Conclusion Blunt cerebrovascular injury is a rare but devastating complication of blunt trauma. The recommended screening modality is CTA, and the most common treatment is antiplatelet/anticoagulant medication. Mandibular and LeFort fractures were the most common isolated CMF injury associated with BCVI, highlighting the need for prospective trials to expand current screening criteria.

AB  - Abstract In this article, we report the prevalence of traumatic events (TEs), lifetime and 12-month posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among 148 women experiencing homelessness in 3 midsized cities in the United States (Omaha, NE, Pittsburgh, PA, and Portland, OR). The women ranged in age from 19 to 54 years with an average age of 38.89 years (SD = 10.18). The sample was 42.6% White/European American. We investigated the mediation of distal TEs (i.e., childhood maltreatment) by more proximal TEs associated with being homeless (i.e., homelessness-related stressors) for meeting diagnostic criteria for 12-month PTSD. Results indicated that 42.6% of the women met criteria for lifetime PTSD and 39.7% met criteria for past-year PTSD. The number of TEs reported ranged from 0 to 16 in order of prevalence with a median of 6 TEs. The correlations between childhood maltreatment and 12-month PTSD ranged from .16 to .20 and the correlations between homelessness-related stressors and 12-month PTSD ranged from .21 to .30. The mediation analysis was consistent with the association between childhood maltreatment and past-year PTSD being fully mediated by homelessness-related trauma.

AB  - Abstract Patients with supraventricular tachycardia commonly present to the ED. There is a lack of consensus regarding assessment of these patients. Our aim was to determine the utility of troponin and four other investigations (full blood examination, electrolyte levels, thyroid function tests and chest X-rays) commonly requested for these patients. MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 1992?March 2017) were searched for randomised controlled trials and observational studies (of sample size greater than 10). Our search strategy yielded no randomised controlled trials and seven observational studies with significant statistical heterogeneity among selected studies (I2 87.3%, P < 0.001). Included studies investigated a total of 1155 patients. All studies reported on the utility of troponin testing in this patient population. The pooled proportion of patients investigated with troponin was 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.44?0.88). The pooled proportion of positive troponin tests was 0.32 (95% confidence interval 0.23?0.41). Only one study reported on the utility of the remaining four investigations with abnormal results as follows: thyroid stimulating hormone 14%, haemoglobin 6%, white cell count 19% and chest X-ray 22%. Investigations are commonly requested for patients presenting with supraventricular tachycardia. Troponin testing is commonly performed with a high proportion of positive findings although these results did not appear to be associated with major adverse cardiac events. Heterogeneity among studies and low levels of evidence precluded conclusions on full blood examinations, electrolyte levels, thyroid testing and utility of chest X-rays in this patient population.

AB  - Abstract Due to its early utilization and increasing ability to provide genetic information, non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) has reinforced social and bioethical quandaries concerning prenatal genetics. This paper presents exploratory findings based on 20 semi-structured interviews conducted in 2017?2019 with Israeli parents of children with Down syndrome (DS), four of whom also serving as representatives of DS organizations. Their views are presented regarding the pros and cons of NIPS; the social context of decision-making about NIPS; and views on life with DS and termination of pregnancies on that ground. While illustrating the large heterogeneity of views concerning NIPS and prenatal diagnosis (PND) amongst parents of children with DS, our respondents commonly criticized the imbalanced information provided by professionals regarding DS, seen as sending a discriminating message in line with the public ignorance surrounding DS. These views are further discussed in the multi-cultural, ableist and pro-natal context of Israeli society. We conclude by offering practical implications concerning NIPS, parental autonomy, and informed choice.
