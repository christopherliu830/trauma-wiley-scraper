AB  - The aim of this replication study was to determine if prior findings at one U.S. dental school about dental students' comfort discussing and perceptions of the relevance of 15 risk behaviors to adolescent patient oral health care would be observed at other institutions. All first- and fourth-year dental students (n=414) at three U.S. dental schools in fall 2017 were invited to participate, and 218 completed the survey (52.7% response rate). These students reported feeling comfortable to uncomfortable discussing risk behaviors with adolescent patients, yet perceived those risk behaviors as relevant to their oral health. There were significant differences in student comfort discussing risk behaviors with adolescents and their perceptions of relevance by gender, age, class status, and school location. Males were more comfortable than females discussing oral health risk behaviors. There were no significant differences by race/ethnicity. Fourth-year students had higher levels of comfort discussing risk behaviors than first-year students. Compared to students in the South and Midwest schools, students at the West school were more comfortable discussing selected topics and had higher perceptions of their relevance to adolescent oral health care. These results suggest there is room for improvement in this area of dental education. Dental schools should aim to strengthen students' knowledge of and comfort in discussing oral health risk behaviors with adolescent patients with the use of educational activities and clinical experiences.

AB  - Clinical data related to GTR therapy for Class II furcations were analyzed from 7 treatment centers that evaluated one of two possible treatment pairs, either bioabsorbable collagen membrane (Type I bovine tendon collagen) (COLL) versus control surgical debridement (DEBR) or COLL versus expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE). After initial preparation and re-evaluation, full thickness flaps were reflected, the defects debrided, and the roots planed. Furcations and associated bony defects in each patient were randomly assigned to one of the 2 treatments in each pair, and the flaps closed. Patients received quarterly periodontal maintenance until surgical re-entry at 6 to 12 (mean 11.1) months. Data from 59 pairs of Class II furcations were analyzed via paired t, Wilcoxon signed rank, and RM ANOVA tests. COLL showed better results than DEBR for vertical defect fill, percent defect resolution, and horizontal furcation fill. When COLL was compared to ePTFE in furcations across patients, no differences were found. Both COLL and ePTFE resulted in an improvement in clinical furcation Class about 50% of the time (compared to 7% frequency with DEBR). COLL use yielded 8 and ePTFE yielded 1 clinically-complete furcation closures. COLL barriers resulted in generally favorable clinical results in furcation defects, appeared to be better than DEBR alone, and were at least similar to and often better than ePTFE. COLL of the type used in this study appears to be a useful and beneficial material for regenerative therapy in Class II furcation type periodontal defects. J Periodontol 1996;67:650?657.

AB  - Abstract Japanese macaque societies are characterized by frequent intragroup conflict both in free-ranging and zoo-housed conditions. In zoos, understanding the factors that contribute to wounding is of interest because this knowledge can aid in proactive husbandry and management planning that can minimize the negative impacts wounding can have on individual welfare. This study sought to determine whether the variables sex, season and age predicted wounding rates. Data were collected for 24 months on 119 Japanese macaques living in 10 zoos, and we analyzed the contribution of variables using generalized linear mixed models. A total of 1,007 wounds were reported, and the best model included the interaction between sex and season. Follow-up analyses revealed that females incurred more wounds than males, and this sex difference was more pronounced during the breeding compared to the nonbreeding season. On average, individuals received 4.67 (±SEM: 0.55) wounds per year and 77.31% of the population incurred at least one wound in the study period. The majority of wounds were superficial and did not require veterinary intervention. Wound locations were not randomly distributed across body regions and were most often reported on the face. Finally, macaques living in larger social groups experienced more wounds, on average. This study represents the first quantification of wounding in this species and may provide insight to help inform husbandry and management strategies in zoos.

AB  - Abstract Post-traumatic stress disorder is a long-lasting psychiatric disease after the traumatic experience of severe fatal stress with the consequence of hippocampal atrophy. Freezing behaviors were more than quintupled on the fear-conditioning test in mice previously subjected to water immersion restrain stress (WIRS) with metronome tones when determined 1?28?days after WIRS, while these mice exhibited the increased immobility time on the forced swimming test with the increased spontaneous locomotion. Prior experience of WIRS led to a transient decrease in subsequent 5-bromo-2?-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation into proliferating cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. These behavioral and neurochemical alterations were significantly prevented by the daily injection of the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine, respectively. Moreover, WIRS significantly decreased the number of cells holding BrdU without affecting the differentiation ratio to astroglial and neuronal lineages 28?days later. Prior administration of an NMDA receptor antagonist significantly prevented the aforementioned changes by WIRS. These results suggest that NMDA receptors may play a role in mechanisms underlying the crisis of a variety of psychiatric symptoms relevant to post-traumatic stress disorder through transient suppression of neural progenitor cell proliferation in the murine hippocampal dentate gyrus.

AB  - Aim:? To study and compare the type and frequency of injury to indigenous and non-indigenous patients admitted to the Orthopaedic Unit at Cairns Base Hospital. Method and analysis:? Relevant statistics for all patients were entered or calculated: demographics, length of stay, comorbidity and complications were available. After Variance Analysis, age-standardised rates of trauma were tested using confidence intervals. Results:? Of 2254 admissions for trauma in 32 months, 23% were indigenous (12% of the catchment population). Upper limb injuries were significantly higher for all indigenes, these males being admitted three times as frequently as non-indigenous males. Specific lesions showed greater differences and punch injuries were prominent in both indigenous sexes. Indigenous women were much more likely to be the victims of assault or fights than other groups. Conclusions:? Personal injury costs are high in the indigenous community, in human and material terms. More resources should be directed towards injury prevention.

AB  - Abstract BACKGROUND To assess whether the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is associated with the risk of prostate cancer (PCa) detection via a multi (≥12)-core prostate biopsy. METHODS From January 2004 to May 2011, 3,107 patients underwent transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) prostate biopsies due to elevated PSA levels ranging between 3 and 20?ng/ml or abnormal digital rectal exams (DREs). Multivariate logistic analysis was used to assess the potential association of LUTS and PCa detection via biopsy. The predictive accuracy of the multivariate model was assessed based on the receiver operating characteristics-derived area under the curve. RESULTS The median International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was 11, and the mean PSA was 6.81?ng/ml. Of the total subjects, PCa was detected from biopsy in 931 (30.0%) patients. In a comparison of 1,465 patients with IPSS ≥11 and 1,642 patients with IPSS <11, those with a higher IPSS were older, had higher PSA and had a larger prostate, but there were no significant differences in the PCa detection rates. However, in multivariate analysis incorporating other associated variables, a higher IPSS was significantly associated with lower odds of PCa detection (P?=?0.016). Nevertheless, addition of the IPSS did not significantly increase the accuracy of the multivariate model devised for the detection of PCa (P?=?0.098). CONCLUSIONS Although PCa was detected less commonly among men with higher LUTS, LUTS may not provide additional prognostic information beyond that which can be obtained via previously established prognostic factors.

AB  - Background and purpose Enzogenol, a flavonoid-rich extract from Pinus radiata bark with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties has been shown to improve working memory in healthy adults. In traumatic brain injury (TBI), oxidation and inflammation have been linked to poorer cognitive outcomes. Hence, this phase II, randomized controlled trial investigated safety, compliance and efficacy of Enzogenol for improving cognitive functioning in people following mild TBI. Methods Sixty adults, who sustained a mild TBI, 3?12?months prior to recruitment, and who were experiencing persistent cognitive difficulties [Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ) score >?38], were randomized to receive Enzogenol (1000?mg/day) or matching placebo for 6?weeks. Subsequently, all participants received Enzogenol for a further 6?weeks, followed by placebo for 4?weeks. Compliance, side-effects, cognitive failures, working and episodic memory, post-concussive symptoms and mood were assessed at baseline, 6, 12 and 16?weeks. Simultaneous estimation of treatment effect and breakpoint was effected, with confidence intervals (CIs) obtained through a treatment?placebo balance-preserving bootstrap procedure. Results Enzogenol was found to be safe and well tolerated. Trend and breakpoint analyses showed a significant reduction in cognitive failures after 6?weeks [mean CFQ score, 95% CI, Enzogenol versus placebo ?6.9 (?10.8 to ?4.1)]. Improvements in the frequency of self-reported cognitive failures were estimated to continue until week 11 before stabilizing. Other outcome measures showed some positive trends but no significant treatment effects. Conclusions Enzogenol supplementation is safe and well tolerated in people after mild TBI, and may improve cognitive functioning in this patient population. This study provides Class IIB evidence that Enzogenol is well tolerated and may reduce self-perceived cognitive failures in patients 3?12?months post-mild TBI.

AB  - Objectives This comprehensive review examined the prevalence and progression of disturbances in reality testing (DRT), defined as psychotic symptoms, cognitive disruptions, and thought problems, in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (O-BD). Our approach was grounded in a developmental psychopathology perspective and considered a broader phenotype of risk within the bipolar?schizophrenia spectrum as measured by categorical and dimensional assessments of DRT in high-risk youth. Methods Relevant studies were identified from numerous sources (e.g., PubMed, reference sections, and colleagues). Inclusion criteria were: (i) family risk studies published between 1975 and 2012 in which O-BD were contrasted with a comparison group (e.g., offspring of parents who had other psychiatric disorders or were healthy) on DRT outcomes and (ii) results reported for categorical or dimensional assessments of DRT (e.g., schizophrenia, psychotic symptoms, cluster A personality traits, or thought problems), yielding a total of 23 studies. Results Three key findings emerged: (i) categorical approaches of DRT in O-BD produced low incidence base rates and almost no evidence of significant differences in DRT between O-BD and comparison groups, whereas (ii) many studies using dimensional assessments of DRT yielded significant group differences in DRT. Furthermore, (iii) preliminary evidence from dimensional measures suggested that the developmental progression of DRT in O-BD might represent a prodrome of severe psychological impairment. Conclusions Preliminary but promising evidence suggests that DRT is a probable marker of risk for future impairment in O-BD. Methodological strengths and weaknesses, the psychometric properties of primary DRT constructs, and future directions for developmental and longitudinal research with O-BD are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Trends indicate overall declines in numbers of volunteer emergency service workers and suggest negative organisational factors impacting adversely on volunteers and organisations. Conflict between emergency service work and family is implicated in falling volunteer numbers, and there is thus a need for research on difficulties experienced in balancing volunteer work and family. The current study tested an adaptation of the work-family conflict (WFC) model originally proposed by Frone, Russell, and Cooper, in a sample of 102 couples in which one partner was an Australian emergency service volunteer. Results supported a model in which volunteer work-related antecedents, including time invested in on-call emergency activities and post-traumatic stress symptoms, had indirect links with outcomes, including volunteer burnout and their partners' support for the volunteer work role, through the effects of WFC. These results add to research using theoretical models of paid work processes to better understand the problems faced by volunteer workers, and identify specific antecedents and outcomes of WFC in the volunteer emergency services. Implications for future research and organisations reliant on volunteer workers are discussed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background Patients with severe, multiple, traumatic injuries are challenging to manage in critical care. Early identification of injuries and optimal resuscitation is essential for favourable outcomes. Trauma-related haemorrhage can lead to the lethal triad of hypothermia, coagulopathy and acidosis. Many trauma patients require urgent haemorrhage control and structural fixation through operative intervention. However, metabolic derangement and cardiovascular instability may delay surgery, resulting in an ongoing cycle of deterioration. Damage control surgery (DCS) may be used as a temporizing measure until the patient is stabilized in critical care. The aim of this case study is to discuss the complex issues faced in the critical care management of a severely injured patient. Design We conducted a patient case study, with analysis of care using published evidence. The key terms used to search for evidence were trauma, injury, damage control surgery, spinal fixation, critical/intensive care and nurse. Results We report the care of a trauma patient with complex, conflicting injuries requiring management of the lethal triad and DCS. The delay in subsequent definitive repair of spinal column fractures provided many challenges for critical care nurses including restricted patient mobilization, positioning and pressure ulcer prevention. A review of contemporary evidence relating to DCS reveals that whilst this technique is used increasingly in trauma, the research focuses on single system injuries. Conclusion Evidence and guidelines are required to support DCS for critical care patients with multiple, conflicting injuries including spinal fractures. For patients with delayed surgical intervention, rotational bed therapy may assist critical care nurses in meeting needs.

AB  - Abstract Heterotopic ossification (HO) occurs at a high frequency in severe orthopaedic extremity injuries; however, the etiology of traumatic HO is virtually unknown. Osteogenic progenitor cells have previously been identified within traumatized muscle. Although the signaling mechanisms that lead to this dysregulated differentiation pathway have not been identified, it is assumed that inflammation and fibrosis, which contribute to an osteoinductive environment, are necessary for the development of HO. The hypothesis of this study was that cytokines related to chronic inflammation, fibrogenesis, and osteogenesis become up-regulated following severe muscle trauma where HO forms. Classification of these cytokines by their differential expression relative to control muscle will provide guidance for further study of the mechanisms leading to HO. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed no significant up-regulation of cytokines typically associated with HO (e.g., BMP-4, as observed in the genetic form of HO, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva). Instead, the cytokine gene expression profile associated with the traumatized muscle included up-regulation of cytokines associated with osteogenesis and fibrosis (i.e., BMP-1 and TGF-?1). Using immunohistochemistry, these cytokines were localized to fibroproliferative lesions, which have previously been implicated in HO. This study identifies other cell and tissue-level interactions in traumatized muscle that should be investigated further to better define the etiology of HO. ? 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Damage control resuscitation (DCR) has become a more widely adopted acute management strategy over the past decade. A cornerstone of this strategy is the performance of an initial limited surgical intervention for the control of active bleeding and contamination. This technique is indicated where significant physiological compromise exists and immediate surgical intervention is required. This damage control surgery itself is completed judiciously to allow a period of resuscitative stabilisation before later definitive surgical solutions. This discussion describes the three further principles of DCR and then explores the rationale and drivers behind the development of this approach.

AB  - Background:? Building on previous research with adolescents that examined demographic variables and other forms of substance abuse in relation to non-medical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD), the current study examined potentially traumatic events, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), other substance use, and delinquent behavior as potential correlates of past-year non-medical use of prescription drugs. Method:? A nationally representative sample of 3,614 non-institutionalized, civilian, English-speaking adolescents (aged 12?17?years) residing in households with a telephone was selected. Demographic characteristics, traumatic event history, mental health, and substance abuse variables were assessed. NMUPD was assessed by asking if, in the past year, participants had used a prescription drug in a non-medical manner. Multivariable logistic regressions were conducted for each theoretically derived predictor set. Significant predictors from each set were then entered into a final multivariable logistic regression to determine significant predictors of past-year NMUPD. Results:? NMUPD was endorsed by 6.7% of the sample (n?=?242). The final multivariable model showed that lifetime history of delinquent behavior, other forms of substance use/abuse, history of witnessed violence, and lifetime history of PTSD were significantly associated with increased likelihood of NMUPD. Conclusions: Risk reduction efforts targeting NMUPD among adolescents who have witnessed significant violence, endorsed abuse of other substances and delinquent behavior, and/or endorsed PTSD are warranted. Interventions for adolescents with history of violence exposure or PTSD, or those adjudicated for delinquent behavior, should include treatment or prevention modules that specifically address NMUPD.

AB  - Background Appropriate allergen threshold concentrations (TCs) for intradermal testing (IDT) have not been established in horses for many pollen and mould allergens. Objectives To determine the TCs in non-allergic horses and describe the frequency of late phase reactions for 26 allergens, including trees, grasses, weeds and moulds in horses residing in the southern Unites States. Animals Twenty four clinically normal horses in the southern United States. Methods Threshold concentrations for different allergens were determined using IDT subjective measurements at 30 minutes. Delayed reactions were evaluated at 4 and 24 h. Results Threshold concentrations (all PNU/mL) were established for eight tree allergens (black willow 1,000, box elder 1,000, live oak 1,000, pecan 2,000, white ash 4,000, red oak 4,000, red mulberry 2,000 and green ash 2,000); two grass allergens (Johnson grass 250 PNU/mL and Kentucky blue grass 500 PNU/mL); two weeds (carelessweed 1,000 PNU/mL, great ragweed 500 PNU/mL) and one mould (Curvularia 8,000 PNU/mL). The TC was not determined due to excessive reactivity at the lowest concentration tested (1,000 PNU/mL) for bahia and perennial rye grass. Eleven other allergens did not meet the criteria to establish a TC when evaluated at 30 min due to lack of positive reactions. Multiple allergens caused positive reactions in ≥10% of horses at 4 h. Reactions at 24 h were rare with the exception of one horse. Conclusions and clinical importance This study identified intradermal TC for multiple pollen and mould allergens in horses. These values may prove useful for optimizing allergen concentrations for IDT of allergic horses.

AB  - Purpose? TRD is an uncommon but serious consequence of blunt trauma. It is often associated with other life threatening injuries and its diagnosis is challenging. Limited information exists on outcomes following rupture, although there are increasing reports of late recurrent herniation. Our aim was to document the outcome of TRD initially and at intermediate term follow up (up to five years). Methodology? A review of all patients suffering TRD, over the past five years, at The Alfred Hospital was performed. Injury severity score (ISS), associated injuries, diagnosis- early versus late and imaging modality used, and surgical repair technique were recorded. All patients were followed up with a questionnaire, regarding symptoms of recurrence and chest X-ray (CXR). Results? 33 patients (18 female, 15 male; mean age 36?yrs, mean ISS 42) were included. All injury mechanisms were high energy (motor vehicle occupants 27, pedestrians 5, horse rider 1); 25 sustained other intra-abdominal injuries. There were nine early and no late deaths. CXR was diagnostic in 14 cases, with 23 recognised early (pre-operatively). 6 were diagnosed intra-operatively (5 for instability, 1 following unremarkable imaging). 3 late diagnoses (>24 hours after presentation) occurred, with 1 at 6 months post injury. Emergent primary repair was undertaken using non-absorbable sutures, although in three cases absorbable sutures were used. Conclusions? TRD is associated with high energy blunt force and severe multi-system injury. We advocate emergent primary repair with non-absorbable suture and advise a minimum five year follow-up.

AB  - Abstract Aim This study aimed at exploring changes in YAP expression and their effect on periodontitis (PD) combined with traumatic occlusion (TO). Materials and Methods BALB/cJ mice were used to establish a PD model by local administration of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g, ATCC 33277) and a TO model by occlusal elevation (OE) using composite resin bonding on the bilateral maxillary molar. The mouse fibroblast cell line (L929) and pre-osteoblast cell line (MC3T3-E1) were subjected to cyclic tensile/compressive stress and inflammatory stimuli (lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli) to verify in vivo results. Results Severe bone resorption was observed by microCT scanning in OE with P.g group, when compared to OE only and P.g only groups. Mechanical stress caused by OE activated the Hippo-YAP pathway in periodontal tissues and upregulated the expression of JNK/AP-1. OE with P.g further promoted the expression of YAP and JNK/AP1, leading to the upregulation of the JNK/AP-1 related inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL6. Similar results were obtained when osteoblasts were subjected to mechanical stress in vitro. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that periodontitis with TO caused severe inflammation-induced bone resorption. Activation of YAP and upregulation of JNK/AP-1 induced by TO potentially aggravated the symptoms of PD.

AB  - Abstract This chapter reviews psychological trauma from a multilevel developmental psychopathology. This perspective holds that no single approach or discipline adequately encompasses the phenomenon of psychological trauma and how it interacts with development in terms of its impact on the individual. Rather, multiple levels are preferable, including the areas of neurobiology, psychology, psychopathology, and psychiatric diagnosis, individual, familial, societal, cultural, economic, and physical. To address all of these levels, an interdisciplinary team approach is required, with individuals who have expertise in as wide a range of fields as psychology, psychiatry, neurobiology, immunology, genetics, cardiology, internal medicine, statistics, radiology, physics, computer science, psychopharmacology, child development, philosophy and literature. The implication is that no single individual or specialty will have sufficient expertise and knowledge in enough areas to provide an appropriate characterization of the effects of trauma on the individual. Additionally, all of these areas will interact with developmental epoch in different ways. Use of the multilevel developmental psychopathology approach has the promise of being more helpful to individuals affected by psychological trauma.

AB  - Abstract Background We sought to determine the feasibility of co-administering everolimus with a four-drug reinduction in children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) experiencing a first marrow relapse. Procedure This phase I study tested everolimus with vincristine, prednisone, pegaspargase and doxorubicin in patients with marrow relapse occurring >18 months after first complete remission (CR). The primary aim was to identify the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus. Three dose levels (DLs) were tested during dose escalation (2, 3, and 5 mg/m2/day). Additional patients were enrolled at the 3- and 5 mg/m2/day DLs to further evaluate toxicity (dose expansion). Results Thirteen patients enrolled during dose escalation and nine during dose expansion. During dose escalation, one dose-limiting toxicity occurred (grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia) in six evaluable patients at DL3 (5 mg/m2/day). The most common grade ≥3 adverse events were febrile neutropenia, infections, transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypophosphatemia. Two of the 12 patients treated at DL3 developed Rothia mucilaginosa meningitis. Nineteen patients (86%) achieved a second CR (CR2). Of those, 13 (68%) had a low end-reinduction minimal residual disease (MRD) level (≤10?3 by polymerase chain reaction?based assay). The CR2 rate for patients with B-cell ALL treated at DL3 (n = 12) was 92%; 82% of these patients had low MRD. Conclusions Everolimus combined with four-drug reinduction chemotherapy was generally well tolerated and associated with favorable rates of CR2 and low end-reinduction MRD. The recommended phase 2 dose of everolimus given in combination with a four-drug reinduction is 5 mg/m2/day. This promising combination should be further evaluated in a larger patient cohort.

AB  - Objective:? Bipolar disorder (BPD) is associated with significant functional morbidity at a rate which is particularly elevated among patients discharged from hospital. The aim of this study was to examine the degree to which neurocognitive test performance, measured following hospitalization for an acute affective episode, is predictive of functional recovery 1?year later. Methods:? Seventy-eight Zucker Hillside Hospital patients aged 18?59?years and having Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar I disorder (BPD I), bipolar II disorder (BPD II) or BPD not otherwise specified (NOS) confirmed through a rigorous diagnosis consensus procedure, underwent a comprehensive neurocognitive test battery after initial stabilization (baseline) and were followed for at least 12?months (follow-up). Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and Clinician-Administered Rating Scale for Mania (CARS-M) ratings were made at baseline and follow-up. At follow-up, functionality was assessed using the Multidimensional Scale for Independent Functioning (MSIF). Logistic regression was used to examine the predictive value of each of six validated neurocognitive domains for determining functionality (MSIF) at follow-up. Baseline and follow-up HAM-D and CARS-M were entered as covariates as was number of days between baseline and follow-up. Results:? Attention and Ideational Fluency were significantly predictive of functional recovery 12?months later. Residual mania but not depression was associated with 12-month MSIF rating. Lithium and benzodiazepine treatment at the time of neurocognitive testing did not affect the results. Conclusions:? This is the first study examining the predictive value of neurocognitive deficits, independent of residual mania or depression, for long-term functional recovery following hospitalization. Selective neurocognitive deficits are predictive of long-term functional recovery and, as such, should be candidate targets in treatment and rehabilitation programs.

AB  - Literature describing medical treatment of canine prostatic carcinoma (PC) is sparse. The aims of this study were to assess outcomes, including time to progression (TTP) and median survival time (MST), of canine PC treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or chemotherapy, and to identify prognostic factors. Records from 8 institutions were searched for dogs with cytologically or histologically confirmed PC without bladder involvement: 67 dogs were included. Presenting signs were urinary (25), gastrointestinal ([GI], 11) and systemic (3); 16 dogs had GI and urinary signs, 7 dogs had systemic signs with concurrent GI or urinary signs and in 5 dogs the tumour was an incidental finding. Out of 27 dogs, 9 (33%) had positive urine culture. Metastases were identified in 26 dogs to lymph nodes (19), lungs (10), bone (2) and liver (1). Treatment included NSAIDs and chemotherapy (32), NSAIDs alone (31) and chemotherapy alone (4). The overall MST was 82 days (range 9-752) and median TTP was 63 days (range 9-752). Dogs receiving NSAIDs combined with chemotherapy experienced a significantly longer MST (106 vs 51 days; P?=?.035) and TTP (76 vs 44 days; P?=?.02) compared to dogs receiving NSAIDs alone. Intact dogs and those with metastatic disease had significantly shorter MST (31 vs 90 days, P?=?.018 and 49 vs 109 days, P?=?.037, respectively); intact dogs also had significantly shorter TTP (25 vs 63 days, P?=?.0003). This study suggests that a combination of NSAIDs and chemotherapy may improve outcomes in canine PC. Metastatic disease and being entire negatively influenced prognosis.
