AB  - Objectives To determine whether past history of depression is associated with increased rates of gestational diabetes, and whether history of gestational diabetes is associated with increased rates of postpartum depression. Research design Data for this case?control study consisted of de-identified chart records for 1439 women who received pregnancy care at a large university hospital between 1998 and 2017. Results A history of depression prior to pregnancy was associated with gestational diabetes requiring insulin, although not with subtler degrees of gestational hyperglycemia. Diabetes in pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk of postpartum depression. Trauma history was associated with both impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy and postpartum depression. Conclusions Past episodes of depression increase risk for the most severe form of gestational diabetes; however, gestational diabetes does not contribute significantly to risk for postpartum depression. This suggests a unidirectional association, unlike the bidirectional association of diabetes with depression among the general population. History of trauma increases risk for both gestational hyperglycemia and postpartum depression, suggesting important health effects of trauma that may differ measurably from those associated with depression.

AB  - Background: Several studies have shown that GTR therapy of intrabony defects results in significantly better outcomes than access flap alone. Most of the available data, however, have been produced in highly controlled research environments by a small group of investigators. Generalizability of results to different clinicians and different subject populations has not been evaluated so far. Methods: This parallel group study involved 143 patients recruited in a practicebased research network of 11 offices in 7 countries. It was designed to evaluate: 1) the applicability of the documented added benefits of GTR in the treatment of intrabony defects to different populations, and 2) the generalizability of the expected results to different clinicians. GTR was compared to access flap alone. Defects, one in each patient, were accessed with a previously described papilla preservation flap in both the test and control group. In addition, GTR sites received application of a bioabsorbable poly-D,L-lactide-co-glycolide membrane. A stringent plaque control regimen was enforced in all patients during the 1-year observation period. Outcomes included gains in clinical attachment (CAL) and reductions in probing depth. Results: Observed gains in CAL were 2.18 ± 1.46 mm for access flap and 3.04 ± 1.64 mm for the GTR-treated group. The treatment-associated difference was statistically significant (P = 0.03) after correcting for both center effect and defect anatomy. Among the various centers, a 1.73 mm difference in CAL gain was observed. This is a clinically relevant amount, which underlines the significance of center variability in the outcome of periodontal surgical procedures. A frequency distribution analysis of the obtained CAL gains indicated that GTR treatment of deep intrabony defects decreased, with respect to the access flap control, the probability of obtaining only a modest attachment gain at 1 year. Conversely, CAL gains of 4 mm or more were observed in more than 40% of GTR-treated defects and in less than 20% of the controls (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: These data indicate that GTR therapy of deep intrabony defects performed by different clinicians on various patient populations resulted in both greater amounts and improved predictability of CAL gains than access flap alone.

AB  - Summary As more patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are surviving, despite severe immune suppression, clinicians are faced with atypical manifestations of both common and uncommon dermatoses. A 30-year-old black South African woman presented with a 10-month history of multiple chronic ulcers appearing on a multidermatomal herpes zoster (HZ) scar. The woman was infected with HIV, and her CD4 count was 45 cells/?L. Histology and PCR revealed cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. This case highlights an unusual presentation of cutaneous CMV occurring as an isotopic immune response on a pre-existing multidermatomal HZ scar.

AB  - Summary Moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a risk factor for several diseases of the aging brain, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While advancing age is the primary risk factor for several neurodegenerative diseases, onset and progression can be strongly influenced by genetics, comorbid conditions, and environmental exposures. Cumulative subconcussive blows, such as those sustained in amateur or professional contact sports, may be a risk factor for cognitive impairment or chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Despite gaps in knowledge, the Committee on Long Term Consequences of Traumatic Brain Injury of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) concluded, after an exhaustive review of hundreds of studies, that there was sufficient evidence to support an association between severe TBI and dementia, and a ?suggestive? association between moderate TBI and dementia.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aim A previous cross-sectional study found that young adults with depression were more likely to have traumatic dental injuries (TDIs). The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between depressive symptoms during early and middle adolescence, and TDIs at age 15-16 years. Method This study used longitudinal data from phases 1 and 3 of the Research with East London Adolescents Community Health Survey (RELACHS), a school-based survey following a representative, multi-ethnic sample of adolescents attending public schools in East London (England). Information on depressive symptoms was collected using the Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) during early (age 11-12 years) and middle adolescence (age 15-16 years). TDIs were identified during clinical examinations in phase 3 when pupils were 15-16 years old. Logistic regression was used to test the association between depressive symptoms at different stages of adolescence and TDIs adjusting for confounders (age, gender, ethnicity, parental employment and overjet). Results Depressive symptoms were reported by 24% and 32% of adolescents in early and middle adolescence, respectively. Evidence of TDIs was found in 18% of adolescents at age 15-16 years. Adolescents with depressive symptoms, either in early or middle adolescence, had greater odds of experiencing TDIs. However, these estimates were not statistically significant. In regression models adjusted for confounders, the odds of having TDIs were 1.23 (95% CI: 0.77-1.96) and 1.23 (95% CI: 0.76-1.95) among pupils with depressive symptoms in early and middle adolescence, respectively. Conclusion There was no association between depressive symptoms and TDIs in early and middle adolescents.

AB  - Summary Fragility fracture accounts for a large percentage of hospital attendances and admissions in orthopaedic trauma settings. Such fractures occur as a result of weakened bone mainly due to osteoporosis. The majority of this type of fracture occurs in older people who have sustained the injury following minimal trauma or following a fall. The most common reason for hospital admission is following a hip fracture. This chapter considers fragility fracture generally and then focusses on the care of the older following hip fracture. This type of injury presents numerous challenges for the orthopaedic practitioner because it often occurs in frail older people and necessitates surgery followed by a protracted period of rehabilitation. The chapter considers how evidence based practice can be applied to ensuring that this vulnerable group of patients can receive care that is focused on achieving the best outcomes.

Methods and results Randomized, controlled, multi-center prospective clinical trial with randomization 2:1 in favor of the OFFII. Primary efficacy endpoint was the rate of successful device placement and defect closure without major complications at hospital discharge. All data were assessed through a core laboratory. Interim analysis was performed when 70% of the patients were treated to evaluate for noninferiority. From a total of 176 randomized subjects, interim analysis was performed on the first 158 patients (65.2% female) (107 OFFII/51 ASO) undergoing device closure at a median weight of 42?kg (range 13-125?kg). Seventy-six percent (120 patients) completed 6-month follow-up. Successful device placement (first attempt) was achieved in 99.1% of the OFF group vs 90.2% of the ASO group (P?<?0.05). Early efficacy success was achieved in 94.4% of the OFFII group vs 90.2% of the ASO group (P?<?0.001). The incidence of major complications was 5.6% for the OFFII group compared to 9.8% for the ASO. Conclusions The OFFII device was not inferior to the ASO with less complications and greater efficacy than the ASO.

AB  - Background and Objective Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease caused by oral bacterial infection, is considered to be a risk factor for systemic diseases including diabetes mellitus, bacterial pneumonia, hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of melatonin against periodontal inflammation-induced multiple organ injury in rats. Material and Methods Eighteen female Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into three groups of six rats each: control; lipopolysaccharide (LPS); and LPS + melatonin. During the experimental period (10 d) all rats in the LPS and LPS + melatonin groups were given 10 ?L of LPS (from a 10 mg/mL standard solution of LPS dissolved in saline) on days 1, 3 and 5. The rats in the LPS + melatonin group were given 50 mg/kg of melatonin, daily for 10 d, starting on day 1 after the administration of LPS. All rats were killed at the end of the experimental period. Liver, kidney and lung tissues were removed for investigation by light microscopy. Results The levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were significantly increased in the LPS group compared with the LPS + melatonin group (p < 0.05). There was no significant change in the serum creatinine levels in the groups. However, the changes in serum AST, ALT and BUN levels in the experimental groups did not correlate with changes in histological data. Both LPS and LPS + melatonin groups displayed structural features similar to those of the control group. Conclusion The results revealed that increased serum AST, ALT and BUN levels following periodontitis are ameliorated with melatonin treatment.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs at a high incidence, involving millions of individuals in the U.S. alone. Related to this, there are large numbers of litigants and claimants who are referred annually for forensic evaluation. In formulating opinions regarding claimed injuries, the present review advises experts to rely on two sets of information: TBI outcome and neuropsychological dose?response studies of non-litigants and non-claimants, and response bias literature that has demonstrated the relatively high risk of invalid responding among examinees referred within a secondary gain context, which in turn has resulted in the development of specific assessment methods. Regarding prospective methods for detecting possible response bias, both symptom validity tests, for measuring over-reporting of symptoms on inventories and questionnaires, and performance validity tests, for measuring insufficient effort on ability tests, are considered essential.

AB  - We tested the incremental impact of a job-related set of variables for explaining a utility judgment training effectiveness variable, that is, course completion skill preparedness, beyond background and course-related variables. Our respondents were two different emergency medical service samples, 415 basics and 742 paramedics, from the 2008 US Longitudinal Emergency Medical Technician Attributes and Demographic Study. Extending earlier research into the training of US emergency medical services staff, we developed scales for measuring two course-related affective reaction variables, quality of course materials and quality of lead instructor. We found for both samples that the quality of course materials and quality of lead instructor variables each significantly explained course completion skill preparedness variance beyond controlled-for background variables. We also found that the set of job-related variables explained further, additional variance and that job satisfaction was positively related to course completion skill preparedness for both samples. The limitations of the study and future research ideas are discussed.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its associated concussion are major causes of disability and death. All ages can be affected but children, young adults and the elderly are particularly susceptible. A decline in mortality has resulted in many more individuals living with a disability caused by TBI including those affecting vision. This review describes: (1) the major clinical and pathological features of TBI; (2) the visual signs and symptoms associated with the disorder; and (3) discusses the assessment of quality of life and visual rehabilitation of the patient. Defects in primary vision such as visual acuity and visual fields, eye movement including vergence, saccadic and smooth pursuit movements, and in more complex aspects of vision involving visual perception, motion vision (?akinopsia?), and visuo-spatial function have all been reported in TBI. Eye movement dysfunction may be an early sign of TBI. Hence, TBI can result in a variety of visual problems, many patients exhibiting multiple visual defects in combination with a decline in overall health. Patients with chronic dysfunction following TBI may require occupational, vestibular, cognitive and other forms of physical therapy. Such patients may also benefit from visual rehabilitation, including reading-related oculomotor training and the prescribing of spectacles with a variety of tints and prism combinations.

AB  - Abstract??? The aim of this study was to investigate the current method for recording trauma in UK dental hospitals. A standard questionnaire was sent out to all 19 UK and Irish dental hospitals to investigate how trauma was recorded both at initial presentation and at review appointments. Where a standard form was used, a copy was requested. Each form was analysed to assess what information was being recorded and whether prompts were used. For the initial presentation of trauma, nine institutions had a standard trauma form, one used a standard form for avulsions only, seven had no form and two did not respond. For subsequent follow-up visits of trauma cases, six hospitals had a standard form, one used a standard from for avulsions only, 10 had no form and two did not respond. There was considerable variation in the questions that were asked at initial presentation of trauma cases and follow-up reviews in dento-alveolar trauma. Without consistent recording, there is little chance that multi-centred prospective clinical trials can take place in the field of dental trauma.

AB  - Abstract Background Demand for revision total hip replacement (RTHR) is increasing. Outcomes after RTHR are varied, with reasonable pain relief but smaller gains in function and mobility. Whether sub-optimal rehabilitation contributes to poorer functional outcomes is unclear. Current rehabilitation is not well defined and there is little research into RTHR rehabilitation. Aims and objectives To gather information about the current rehabilitation of patients undergoing planned, single-stage revision or re-revision THR surgery. Methods An online survey was developed and sent to clinicians at 117 orthopaedic centres in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Questions were asked about standard rehabilitation practice pre-operatively, post-operatively and immediately after discharge. The frequency (%) of responses to closed questions was analysed and free-text comments were summarized thematically. Results There were 133 respondents: mostly physiotherapists (92, 69%) and occupational therapists (39, 29%). Pre-operative education was common (112, 84%) but not uniform, and for 52 (46%) the same as for primary THR patients. Respondents were more likely to agree about the general objectives of rehabilitation, for example gait re-education with walking aids (93, 70%), and retraining functional mobility (92, 69%) rather than about specific elements including exercise prescription, duration of hip precautions and provision of occupational therapy. The provision of rehabilitation following discharge varied considerably. Conclusions This survey adds to sparse information about rehabilitation RTHR. No consensus emerged about optimal rehabilitation. The diversity in approach and lack of clear structure suggests work is needed to develop rehabilitation interventions that are tailored to this population.

AB  - Summary.? In spite of an increased interest in the assessment of quality of life (QoL) in children, so far no instrument for children with haemophilia is available. Because of the low prevalence of the condition, such an instrument should also be cross-culturally applicable. In the study presented, a (QoL) assessment instrument for children with haemophilia (the Haemo-QoL questionnaire) was developed and tested in six countries (France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom) for psychometric properties in 339 children with haemophilia and their parents. The Haemo-QoL is a self-reported questionnaire for children in the age ranges 4?7 (I: 21 items), 8?12 (II: 64 items), 13?16?years (III: 77 items) as well as for parent rating containing 9?11 subscales (depending on age-group versions). Psychometric testing involved the examination of reliability and validity. The three age-group versions of the Haemo-QoL had acceptable internal consistency and retest reliability values, as well as possessing sufficient discriminant and convergent validity. However, in young children when compared to older children, these indicators were less satisfactory. The Haemo-QoL full version is now available for children of three age groups and their parents and is ready for use in clinical research (http://www.haemoqol.org).

AB  - Abstract Objectives Post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) have been identified as a meaningful indicator of distress in cancer survivors. Distinct from young adult survivors of childhood cancer, young people diagnosed with cancer as adolescents and young adults (AYAs) face unique psychosocial issues; however, there is little published research of PTSS in the AYA population. This study examines prevalence and predictors of PTSS among AYAs with cancer. Methods As part of a longitudinal study of AYAs with cancer, 151 patients aged 15?39?years completed mailed surveys at 6 and 12?months post-diagnosis. Severity of PTSS was estimated at 6 and 12?months post-diagnosis. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to investigate the predictive effects of socio-demographic and clinical characteristics on changes in PTSS over time. Results At 6 and 12?months, respectively, 39% and 44% of participants reported moderate to severe levels of PTSS; 29% had PTSS levels suggestive of post-traumatic stress disorder. No significant differences in severity of PTSS between 6 and 12?months were observed. Regression analyses suggested that a greater number of side effects were associated with higher levels of PTSS at 6?months. Currently receiving treatment, having surgical treatment, diagnosis of a cancer type with a 90?100% survival rate, remaining unemployed/not in school, and greater PTSS at 6?months were associated with higher levels of PTSS at 12?months. Conclusions Post-traumatic stress symptoms were observed as early as 6?months following diagnosis and remained stable at 12-month follow-up. The development of early interventions for reducing distress among AYA patients in treatment is recommended. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Although psychological resilience has been shown to ?buffer? against depression following major stressors, no studies have reported on this relationship within the prostate cancer (PCa) population, many of whom are at elevated risk of depression, health problems and suicide. To investigate the effects of resilience upon anxiety and depression in the PCa population, postal surveys of 425 PCa patients were collected from two sites: 189 PCa patients at site 1 and 236 at site 2. Background data plus responses to depression and resilience scales were collected. Results indicated that total resilience score was a significant buffer against depression across both sites. Resilience had different underlying component factor structures across sites, but only one (common) factor significantly (inversely) predicted depression. Within that factor, only some specific items significantly predicted depression scores, suggesting a focused relationship between resilience and depression. It may be concluded that measures of resilience may be used to screen depression at-risk PCa patients. These patients might benefit from resilience training to enhance their ability to cope effectively with the stress of their diagnosis and treatment. A focus upon specific aspects of overall resilience may be of further benefit in both these processes.

AB  - Abstract Objective This study aimed to explore the analgesic regimes adopted in our contemporary retrieval practice and the incidence of vomiting in ED after prehospital analgesic use. Method A retrospective review was conducted on trauma patients retrieved by the Hunter Primary Retrieval Service in the Hunter New England Local Health District, New South Wales, Australia, during 2015. Results Of the 379 patients attended by the service in 2015, 196 of them (mean age 38.6, SD 19.68, years) were selected for this review. Morphine was the most commonly used analgesic (mean 68.37%; 95%?CI 61.36?74.81%), followed by fentanyl (mean 48.47%; 95%?CI 41.29?55.70%) and ketamine (mean 34.18%; 95%?CI 27.57?41.28%). Fourteen (7.14%, 95% CI 3.96?11.69%) patients vomited either prehospital or within the ED. Patients in both the emesis and the non-emesis group were comparable in demographics. None of the three studied analgesics were observed to be significantly associated with higher risk of vomiting than the others in this review, although a higher dose of fentanyl was given to the non-emesis group (P?=?0.04). Conclusions The frequency of vomiting in the retrieved patients observed in our study was less than previously reported in the literature. Opioids still prevailed over ketamine as the preferred initial analgesic, with ketamine most commonly used as an adjunct. Multi-centre trials in this field would be preferable in future in view of the relatively low incidence of vomiting in retrieved trauma patients.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To examine the prospective associations among peer victimization and somatic symptoms across 5 years of adolescence using multiple informants and disaggregating effects at the within-person and between-person level. Methods From age 13?17 years, 612 Canadian children (54% girls; 76% White) completed measures of peer victimization and somatic symptoms. Parents (89% mothers) reported on their child's somatic symptoms. We built autoregressive latent trajectory models with structured residuals, controlling for diagnosed medical and psychiatric conditions, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Results Within-person, self-reported somatic symptoms were stable across time and there were bidirectional associations between peer victimization and somatic symptoms across the 5-year period. The magnitude of effect was strongest from somatic symptoms to peer victimization. Between-person, being a girl or having a psychiatric diagnosis predicted higher mean levels and rising trajectories of somatic symptoms and higher mean levels of peer victimization. The level of peer victimization among non-White participants increased over time. In the parent-reported model, somatic symptoms were less stable and did not predict peer victimization. Conclusions The results highlight the dynamic processes between peer victimization and somatic symptoms. Increased effort is needed to protect adolescents with psychiatric problems, girls, and ethnic minorities from peer abuse.
