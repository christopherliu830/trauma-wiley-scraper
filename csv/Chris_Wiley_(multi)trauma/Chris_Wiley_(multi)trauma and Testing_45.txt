AB  - Summary Alternative methods to animal tests form their own category of assays. Unlike industrial applications that almost instantaneously translate acquired scientific knowledge as cell assays, regulatory applications suffer, to put it lightly, from a chronic delay in the transfer of the same knowledge. For soluble-phase approaches, certain laboratories use cocultures with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Recently, two more live cell assays have been adopted by the OECD: the fluorescein diffusion assay published in 2012 and the short-time exposure (STE) assay published on July 28, 2015. In terms of corrosion and irritation measurements, the closest model to physiology consists of using biological skin equivalents. As early as 2004, the OECD noted that skin absorption measurement methods in vitro had been used for many years, with experts adjudging the volume of evaluated data sufficient to establish a guideline.

AB  - Purpose: To test whether chronic stress, interpersonal relatedness, and cognitive burden could explain depression after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Design: A nonprobability sample of 75 mild-to-moderately injured TBI survivors and their significant others, were recruited from five TBI day-rehabilitation programs. All participants were within 2 years of the date of injury and were living in the community. Methods: During face-to-face interviews, demographic information, and estimates of brain injury severity were obtained and participants completed a cognitive battery of tests of directed attention and short-term memory, responses to the Perceived Stress Scale, Interpersonal Relatedness Inventory, Sense of Belonging Instrument, Neurobehavioral Functioning Inventory, and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale;. Findings: Chronic stress was significantly and positively related to post-TBI depression. Depression and postinjury sense of belonging were negatively related. Social support and results from the cognitive battery did not explain depression. Conclusions: Postinjury chronic stress and sense of belonging were strong predictors of post-injury depression and are variables amenable to interventions by nurses in community health, neurological centers, or rehabilitation clinics. Future studies are needed to examine how these variables change over time during the recovery process.

AB  - Introduction Mangalarga Marchador (MM) is the most important Brazilian horse breed. Functional evaluation of MM horses is performed in marcha competitions, where horses must perform 4-gaited exercise at 13?km/h for 70?min. The aim of this work was to test a training protocol to prepare MM horses for marcha competition. Methods Eight untrained MM mares, in randomized blocks with Split plots, were trained for 84 days. Three days/week horses were ridden for one hour (10?min walk, then an individual amount of marcha exercise at 13?km/h established in a previous test, then walk to complete one hour total exercise time). Two days/week, horses walked for one hour. Before training and every 21 days a marcha test (MT) was performed, totaling 5 tests in the experimental period. During the MT, mares were exercised at 13?km/h using a heart rate monitor. Every 10?min heart rate (HR) and blood lactate concentration [La] were recorded. The MT was stopped at 70?min of exercise, or if HR was ≥150?bpm and [La] was ≥4?mmol/L, or if Marcha Time was reached. Blood samples for hemogram, lactate, glucose, triglyceride and CK, LDH, AST determination were collected. Individual time used for training was 10?min less than the exercising time in the previous MT. Regression was used to analyze the results. Results From MT 1 to 4, the positive effect of training was shown on HR, [La] and marcha time (from 9.52?min to 70.5?min, CV?=?26.41). There was not an increase in marcha time on test 5. Conclusions MM mares trained for 63?days with the described protocol are ready to compete in marcha competition. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the Ethical Animal (CETEA) of the UFMG with the 255/11 protocol. Sources of funding:?CNPq, CAPES, FAPEMIG, ABCCMM, Haras Catuni e Raç?es Total.

AB  - Abstract Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can induce long-term behavioral and cognitive disorders. Although the exact origin of these mTBI-related disorders is not known, they may be the consequence of diffuse axonal injury (DAI). Here, we investigated whether MRI at the subacute stage can detect lesions that are associated with poor functional outcome in mTBI by using anatomical images (T1) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Twenty-three patients with mTBI were investigated and compared with 23 healthy volunteers. All patients underwent an MRI investigation and clinical tests between 7 and 28 days (D15) and between 3 and 4 months (M3) after injury. Patients were divided in two groups of poor outcome (PO) and good outcome (GO), based on their complaints at M3. Groupwise differences in gray matter partial volume between PO patients, GO patients and controls were analyzed using Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) from T1 data at D15. Differences in microstructural architecture were investigated using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) and the diffusion images obtained from DTI data at D15. Permutation-based non-parametric testing was used to assess cluster significance at p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons. Twelve GO patients and 11 PO patients were identified on the basis of their complaints. In PO patients, gray matter partial volume was significantly lower in several cortical and subcortical regions compared with controls, but did not differ from that of GO patients. No difference in diffusion variables was found between GO and controls. PO patients showed significantly higher mean diffusivity values than both controls and GO patients in the corpus callosum, the right anterior thalamic radiations and the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus and the fronto-occipital fasciculus bilaterally. In conclusion, PO patients differed from GO patients by the presence of diffusion changes in long association white matter fiber tracts but not by gray matter partial volume. These results suggest that DTI at the subacute stage may be a predictive marker of poor outcome in mTBI. Hum Brain Mapp, 2011. ? 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of impairment and functional disability in children and adolescents, including deterioration in fine as well as gross motor skills. The aim of this study was to assess deficits in sensory organization and postural ability in a young group of TBI patients versus controls by using quantitative force-platform recordings, and to test whether balance deficits are related to variation in structural properties of the motor and sensory white matter pathways. Twelve patients with TBI and 14 controls (aged 8?20 years) performed the Sensory Organisation Test (SOT) protocol of the EquiTest? (Neurocom). All participants were scanned using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) along with standard anatomical scans. Quantitative comparisons of DTI parameters (fractional anisotropy, axial and radial diffusivity) between TBI patients and controls were performed. Correlations between DTI parameters and SOT balance scores were determined. Findings revealed that the TBI group scored generally lower than the control group on the SOT, indicative of deficits in postural control. In the TBI group, reductions in fractional anisotropy were noted in the cerebellum, posterior thalamic radiation, and corticospinal tract. Degree of white matter deterioration was highly correlated with balance deficits. This study supports the view that DTI is a valuable tool for assessing the integrity of white matter structures and for selectively predicting functional motor deficits in TBI patients.

AB  - Abstract Purpose? Child sexual abuse (CSA) is rarely addressed in the Arab world. This study examined the prevalence, risk factors and consequences associated with CSA in Lebanese children before, during and after the 2006 Hezbollah-Israeli war. Method? A total of 1028 Lebanese children (556 boys; 472 girls) were administered an interview questionnaire that included the International Child Abuse Screening Tool, the Trauma Symptom Checklist and the Family Functioning in Adolescence Questionnaire. Results? In total, 249 (24%) children reported at least one incident of CSA; 110 (11%) occurred before the war, 90 (8%) took place in the 1-year period after the war to the time of the data collection and 49 (5%) occurred during the 33-day war. There were no gender differences in CSA reports before or after the war, but boys reported more incidents during the war than did girls. Girls who reported CSA had higher trauma-related symptoms for sleep disturbance, somatization, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and anxiety than did boys. There were geographic differences in the reports of abuse that may be associated with poverty and living standards. Logistic regression analyses correctly classified 89.9% of the cases and indicated that children's age, family size, fathers' education level and family functioning significantly predicted CSA during the period following the war. Conclusions? The prevalence of CSA in the current study is within the reported international range. Given the increase in the incidents of CSA during the war and the significant findings for family-related risk factors, there is an urgent need to provide multi-component culturally appropriate interventions that target the child and the family system in times of peace and conflict.

AB  - Abstract As scholars of crime increasingly use narratives elicited from people found guilty of committing crime, it is critical that we reflect methodologically and theoretically on exactly how researchers collect those narratives, and what scholars do with people's stories and conceptualisations of their past, present, and future. To contribute to these reflections, we examine the utility of the Life History Calendar (LHC) and the Life as a Film (LAAF) procedure for collecting retrospective life histories from incarcerated chronic offenders. We note the respective advantages of each method, particularly for capturing the dynamic social contexts and reflected appraisals during critical periods of the life course of offenders. Most importantly, we argue that using the LHC and the LAAF together not only supplements the deficiencies of each method, but they also work together synergistically to improve the breadth and depth of data collection and our ability to understand the interplay between narratives, context, and experience.

AB  - Abstract Although the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is high among those with severe mental illness, little is known about the use of interventions to lessen the burden of PTSD in this population. Currently, there are limited data about safe and effective interventions to treat these individuals. This systematic published work review presents the scientific published work reporting studies of psychological treatment approaches for individuals with comorbid PTSD and severe mental illness. A secondary aim of this study was to identify the specific models implemented and tested, and their impact upon patient outcomes. A review of the published work from January 2001 through January 2012 of English-language publications retrieved from the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), MEDLINE, and the American Psychological Association generated abstracts (PsycINFO) databases was conducted. Six studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. The treatment programs described were cognitive?behavioural therapy, psychoeducation, exposure-based cognitive?behavioural therapy, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. Evidence of the effectiveness of these programs is examined. Data to support the use of these interventions are limited, indicating the need for further research and efficacy trials. Future areas of research and implications for nursing are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Background and aims The focus of this paper is on the improvement of substance use disorder (SUD) screening and measurement. Using a multi-dimensional item response theory model, the bifactor model, we provide a psychometric harmonization between SUD, depression, anxiety, trauma, social isolation, functional impairment and risk-taking behavior symptom domains, providing a more balanced view of SUD. The aims are to (1) develop the item-bank, (2) calibrate the item-bank using a bifactor model that includes a primary dimension and symptom-specific subdomains, (3) administer using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and (4) validate the CAT-SUD in Spanish and English in the United States and Spain. Design Item bank construction, item calibration phase, CAT-SUD validation phase. Setting Primary care, community clinics, emergency departments and patient-to-patient referrals in Spain (Barcelona and Madrid) and the United States (Boston and Los Angeles). Participants/cases Calibration phase: the CAT-SUD was developed via simulation from complete item responses in 513 participants. Validation phase: 297 participants received the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and the CAT-SUD. Measurements A total of 252 items from five subdomains: (1) SUD, (2) psychological disorders, (3) risky behavior, (4) functional impairment and (5) social support. CAT-SUD scale scores and CIDI SUD diagnosis. Findings Calibration: the bifactor model provided excellent fit to the multi-dimensional item bank; 168 items had high loadings (> 0.4 with the majority > 0.6) on the primary SUD dimension. Using an average of 11 items (four to 26), which represents a 94% reduction in respondent burden (average administration time of approximately 2 minutes), we found a correlation of 0.91 with the 168-item scale (precision of 5 points on a 100-point scale). Validation: strong agreement was found between the primary CAT-SUD dimension estimate and the results of a structured clinical interview. There was a 20-fold increase in the likelihood of a CIDI SUD diagnosis across the range of the CAT-SUD (AUC = 0.85). Conclusions We have developed a new approach for the screening and measurement of SUD and related severity based on multi-dimensional item response theory. The bifactor model harmonized information from mental health, trauma, social support and traditional SUD items to provide a more complete characterization of SUD. The CAT-SUD is highly predictive of a current SUD diagnosis based on a structured clinical interview, and may be predictive of the development of SUD in the future.

AB  - Introduction The objective of this study was to validate a field standardized exercise test (SET) adapted for young endurance horses and to evaluate the effects of age/conditioning level on speed and heart rate values. Methods The study involved 31 horses of Arabian origin bred specifically for endurance and aged 4?yo (n?=?11), 5?yo (n?=?13) or 6?yo (n?=?7). The SET consisted of a warm-up, followed by 15 (4?yo), 30 (5?yo) or 45 (6?yo) minutes of canter at a comfortable steady speed, and finished with 500 meters of fast gallop. Heart rate (HR) was recorded continuously during the SET. The velocities at which HR reached 160 and 200 beats per minute (V160 and V200) were calculated by the linear regression of HR versus speed. Results All horses were able to complete the SET. Resting HR was higher in 4?y than in 5?y and 6?y (P<0.05 via Student's t test). HR and velocities during the SET did not vary significantly with age. Mean?±?SD values for 4?yo, 5?yo and 6?yo respectively are as follows: Resting HR: 47.5?±?7.2, 42.3?±?3.2, 41.3?±?5.4?bpm; HRcanter: 162.7?±?14.3, 156.9?±?17.3, 161.4?±?10.7?bpm; Vcanter: 22.6?±?0.9, 22.4?±?1.2, 23.3?±?1.6?km/h; HRsprint: 191.3?±?18.1, 181.7?±?18.5, 184.1?±?16.2?bpm; Vsprint: 30.3?±?3.0, 31.5?±?6.4, 35.3?±?6.9?km/h; V160: 25.8?±?3.5, 24.8?±?5.0, 27.1?±?5.8?km/h; V200: 36.8?±?6.1, 37.4?±?7.3, 44.3?±?10.9?km/h; Post-exercice lactatemia: 7.4?±?4.5, 13.5?±?3.6, 5.6?±?3.4?mmol/l. These values perfectly fit with those described previously for adult endurance horses. Conclusions The proposed field SET involved both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism reproducing the progress of an endurance race. Further studies are being conducted to discriminate if possible the effects of age from those of conditioning. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the Ethics Committee for the Alfort Veterinary School and the University of Paris-Est; Owner informed consent for participation was obtained.

AB  - Abstract No standard of care is currently recognized for treatment of canine prostatic carcinoma (PC). This retrospective study assesses outcome following definitive-intent, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (RT) in dogs with PC. Medical records review was performed, including 18 patients from four institutions undergoing definitive-intent intensity-modulated radiotherapy to treat PC. Diagnosis was incidental in 7/18 (39%) patients. Five dogs (28%) had evidence of metastasis to loco-regional lymph nodes at diagnosis. Seventeen patients received concurrent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; 15/18 (83%) patients received maximally-tolerated dose (MTD) chemotherapy, with variable drugs and protocols employed. Total prescribed radiation dose ranged from 48 to 54?Gy (median 50?Gy) delivered as daily doses of 2.5-2.8 Gy. One patient was euthanized prior to completing radiotherapy. Acute toxicity was observed in nine patients; Grade 1-2 diarrhoea was the most common toxicity observed. Suspected late toxicity (urethral stricture, ureteral stricture and hindlimb oedema) was observed in three patients. Median event-free survival (EFS) following RT was 220?days, and median overall survival was 563?days. Local progression occurred in seven patients at a median of 241?days. Median overall survival was significantly longer in incidentally diagnosed dogs (581 vs 220?days in symptomatic dogs, P = .042). EFS was significantly longer in patients treated with MTD chemotherapy (241 vs 25?days, P <?.001), and significantly shorter in patients presenting with evidence of metastatic disease (109?days) vs those without (388?days, P = .008). These findings suggest that definitive-intent radiotherapy is a valuable treatment option for local control of canine PC with moderate risk of toxicity.

AB  - In elite sport, the use of strength testing to establish muscle function and performance is common. Traditionally, isokinetic strength tests have been used, measuring torque during concentric and eccentric muscle action. A device that measures eccentric hamstring muscle strength while performing the Nordic hamstring exercise is now also frequently used. The study aimed to investigate the variability of isokinetic muscle strength over time, for example, between seasons, and the relationship between isokinetic testing and the new Nordic hamstring exercise device. All teams (n = 18) eligible to compete in the premier football league in Qatar underwent a comprehensive strength assessment during their periodic health evaluation at Aspetar Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital in Qatar. Isokinetic strength was investigated for measurement error, and correlated to Nordic hamstring exercise strength. Of the 529 players included, 288 players had repeated tests with 1/2 seasons between test occasions. Variability (measurement error) between test occasions was substantial, as demonstrated by the measurement error (approximately 25 Nm, 15%), whether separated by 1 or 2 seasons. Considering hamstring injuries, the same pattern was observed among injured (n = 60) and uninjured (n = 228) players. A poor correlation (r = .35) was observed between peak isokinetic hamstring eccentric torque and Nordic hamstring exercise peak force. The strength imbalance between limbs calculated for both test modes was not correlated (r = .037). There is substantial intraindividual variability in all isokinetic test measures, whether separated by 1 or 2 seasons, irrespective of injury. Also, eccentric hamstring strength and limb-to-limb imbalance were poorly correlated between the isokinetic and Nordic hamstring exercise tests.

Results: Of 123 health professionals participating in training, 67 completed baseline and follow-up surveys. Training improved health professionals? self-reported knowledge of, and confidence in, responding to family violence and understanding of lawyers? roles in hospitals. Belief that patients should be referred to on-site legal services increased. Training did not correspond to actual increased referrals to legal assistance. Conclusion: The program built capacity and willingness of health professionals to identify signs of, and respond to, family violence. Increase in referral rates to legal assistance was not shown. Potential improvements include better data capture and greater availability of legal services. Implications for public health: Strong hospital system supports and reliable recording of family violence referrals need to be in place before introducing such partnerships to other hospitals.

AB  - Summary: We surveyed the treatment of 1 04 patients admitted to 27 out of the 46 departments of neurology (64.5%), neurosurgery (23.0%), and child neurology (12.5%) of Lombardy, the largest Italian Region (population, 9,000,000). Our main aim was to assess the penetration of correct diagnostic and clinicopharmacological information into routine practice. A detailed analysis and discussion are given of data concerning reasons for hospital admission (therapeutic adjustment accounting for 27.3%; diagnostic ascertainment, 53.8%); characteristics of the disease, in terms of duration, clinical manifestations, and pattern of seizures; associated disorders; prevalence and criteria for the use of instrumental diagnostic procedures (EEG, brain scan, computed tomography, etc.); pattern of prescriptions of anticonvulsant drugs at admission and at discharge, with particular emphasis on specific drug choices by specialty; prevalence of single-drug therapy (41% at admission and 47.0% at discharge) versus polytherapy; degree of correspondence between recommended and observed dosage regimens (undertreatment being a more common problem than excessive dosing); and reporting of side effects. Although some of the findings of some recent studies are confirmed, this report documents the feasibility of a regular audit program of the performance of an entire health care system in the treatment of epilepsy. RÉSUMÉ 1104 Patients admis dans 27 des 46 départements de neurologie (64,5%), de neurochirurgie (23,0%) et neurologie pédiatrique (12,5%), de Lombardie, la plus grande région d'ltalie (9.000.000 d'habitants), ont été inclus dans une enquête dont le but principal était d'apprécier la pénétration d'un diagnostic et d'une information clinico-pharmacologique corrects dans la pratique de routine. Une analyse detaillee et une discussion des donnees suivantes sont rapportees: les raisons de 1'hospitalisation (ajustement therapeutique, 27,3%, affirmation du diagnostic, 53,8%); les caracteristiques de la maladie, selon sa duree, ses manifestations cliniques et le type des crises; les troubles as-socies; la prevalence et les criteres d'utilisation des procedes instrumentaux de diagnostic (EEG, radio du crane, scanographie, etc ?); les modalites de prescription des medicaments antiepileptiques à l'entree et à la sortie, en mettant l'accent sur les choix par specialite; la fréquence de la monothérapie (41%à l'entrée, 47,0% a la sortie) par rapport à la polythérapie; le degré de correspondance entre les doses prescrites et les doses prises par le patient (les patients tendent plus souvent à diminuer les doses qu'à les augmenter); l'observation des effets collatéraux. Tout en confirmant certains résultats d'études récentes, ce travail illustre la possibilite de mise au point d'un programme régulier de contrôle des résultats de l'ensemble d'un systeme sanitaire dans le traitement de l'épilepsie.

AB  - Abstract Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was initially conceptualized as a psychopathology that arose as a consequence of war time experiences. More recently, available evidence has demonstrated that post-traumatic stress (PTS) as a consequence of war is buffered by social identity processes. In such contexts, identity resources are arguably more readily accessible given the integral relationship between social identities and intergroup violence. There is no evidence as yet to suggest that social identity processes may act to reduce PTS responses to naturally occurring disasters such as earthquakes and even less data pertaining to non-Western contexts where the impact of such disasters tends to be particularly catastrophic. This article reports on a study undertaken in earthquake-affected regions in Nepal devastated by the April 2015 quake and its major aftershock a month later. Participants (n=399) completed measures of their earthquake experience, Post-Traumatic Stress and Post Traumatic growth (PTG), as well as measures of community identification and collective efficacy. In total 399 people completed the measures approximately six months after the quakes. Results of the study indicated that consistent with tenets of the social identity framework, ethnic and gender group memberships impacted on reported experiences during the earthquake. Reported experience during the quakes and ethnic group membership were both related to increased symptoms of PTS. Ethnicity was also linked to the proportion of respondents reporting clinical levels of PTSD symptoms. The relationship between earthquake experience and PTG was mediated by community identification and collective efficacy. Earthquake experience also had an indirect effect on PTS through collective efficacy. Implications of these findings for those working with traumatized groups are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in significant inflammation which contributes to the evolving pathology. Previously, we have demonstrated that cyclic AMP (cAMP), a molecule involved in inflammation, is down-regulated after TBI. To determine the mechanism by which cAMP is down-regulated after TBI, we determined whether TBI induces changes in phosphodiesterase (PDE) expression. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats received moderate parasagittal fluid-percussion brain injury (FPI) or sham injury, and the ipsilateral, parietal cortex was analyzed by western blotting. In the ipsilateral parietal cortex, expression of PDE1A, PDE4B2, and PDE4D2, significantly increased from 30 min to 24 h post-injury. PDE10A significantly increased at 6 and 24 h after TBI. Phosphorylation of PDE4A significantly increased from 6 h to 7 days post-injury. In contrast, PDE1B, PD4A5, and PDE4A8 significantly decreased after TBI. No changes were observed with PDE1C, PDE3A, PDE4B1/3, PDE4B4, PDE4D3, PDE4D4, PDE8A, or PDE8B. Co-localization studies showed that PDE1A, PDE4B2, and phospho-PDE4A were neuronally expressed, whereas PDE4D2 was expressed in neither neurons nor glia. These findings suggest that therapies to reduce inflammation after TBI could be facilitated with targeted therapies, in particular for PDE1A, PDE4B2, PDE4D2, or PDE10A.

AB  - Summary Our study examines how personality and coping influence soldiers' psychological health among 648 US Army personnel who were at that time deployed in Iraq at the height of an insurgency. Conscientiousness, neuroticism, and extraversion were associated with different coping behaviors, and these were in turn related to psychological distress. Conscientiousness was positively associated with problem-focused coping and negatively with avoidance coping, whereas neuroticism was most positively associated with avoidance coping. Extraversion was positively related to both seeking social support and avoidance coping. As expected, avoidance coping was positively associated with psychological distress. Coping style explained more variance in the relationship between personality and distress among soldiers who perceived higher levels of threat, thus supporting a moderated mediation hypothesis. We discuss implications for facilitating the stress coping of workers who face acute and potentially traumatic stress exposures. Copyright ? 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background Traumatic brain injury is a worldwide health issue and a significant cause of preventable deaths and disabilities. We aimed to describe population-based data on intensive care treated traumatic brain injury in Iceland over 15 years period. Methods Retrospective review of all intensive care unit admissions due to traumatic brain injury at The National University Hospital of Iceland 1999?2013. Data were collected on demographics, mechanism of injury, alcohol consumption, glasgow come scale upon admission, Injury Severity Scoring, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score, length of stay, interventions and mortality (defined as glasgow outcome score one). All computerized tomography scans were reviewed for Marshall score classification. Results Intensive care unit admissions due to traumatic brain injury were 583. The incidence decreased significantly from 14/100.000/year to 12/100.000/year. Males were 72% and the mean age was 41 year. Majority of patients (42%) had severe traumatic brain injury. The most common mechanism of injury was a fall from low heights (36.3%). The mortality was 18.2%. Increasing age, injury severity score, Marshall score and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score are all independent risk factors for death. Glasgow coma scale was not an independent prognostic factor for outcome. Conclusions Incidence decreased with a shift in injury mechanism from road traffic accidents to falls and an increased rate of traumatic brain injury in older patients following a fall from standing or low heights. Mortality was higher in older patients falling from low heights than in younger patients suffering multiple injuries in road traffic accidents. Age, injury severity score, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score and Marshall score are good prognostic factors for outcome. Traumatic brain injury continues to be a considerable problem and the increase in severe traumatic brain injury in the middle age and older age groups after a seemingly innocent accident needs a special attention.

AB  - Abstract Aim This is a study protocol to investigate nurses' perspectives on refugee health care in two countries. The aims are to: (a) explore self-reported work environment factors, including work stressors, self-rated leadership, staffing and resources adequacy, and teamwork among Jordanian and Lebanese nurses caring for refugees; (b) investigate the relationship between nurse related outcomes (physical health; emotional exhaustion) and their psychosocial work environment; and (c) assess the association between nurses' perceived work environment factors and implicit rationing of care and quality of patient care. Background Globally, the care of refugees is achieving increased attention. Over 6.3 million people are internally displaced and 4.8 million recorded Syrian expatriates are residing in and receiving healthcare services in the neighbouring host countries. Design This is a cross-sectional, comparative study using a survey design. Method The study setting involves both private and public hospitals and primary healthcare centres that provide care to refugees on regular basis in Lebanon and Jordan. The estimated sample size includes 3,000 Registered Nurses from Lebanon and 2,500 nurses and midwives from Jordan. Discussion Workplace factors affecting quality of nursing care and psychosocial status of nurses caring for refugees will be identified. Potential findings will help leaders design interventions to support nurses who are serving refugees for safer care and better patient outcomes. Findings will assist in more efficient resource allocation and management. Impact New knowledge on the impact of providing health care for refugees will be generated based on the structure of nursing care (e.g., work environment), on the nursing process (e.g., implicit rationing of care), and nurse outcomes (health) in two hosting communities. Moreover, factors enabling resilience in patients, providers, and systems will be identified and be of potential use in addressing the growing global problem of caring for displaced persons.
