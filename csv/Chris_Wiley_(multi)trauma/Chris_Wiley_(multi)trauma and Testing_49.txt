AB  - Abstract Background: Bleeding is a major concern in endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), as it may impede surgical progress and is often associated with complications. To improve the study and management of intraoperative bleeding, a standardized method of recording bleeding during ESS is needed. The aim of this study was to develop a standardized method of documenting bleeding in ESS and of grading the surgical field. Methods: Bleeding after endoscopic sinus surgery was recorded using video-endoscopy. Standardized and non-standardized video-endoscopies of 20 patients were graded using a previously published grading scale (the Boezaart scale) in randomized order on two different occasions. Effects of standardization on intra- and interrater reliability were evaluated. Based on this experience, a new 11-point surgical field grading scale was developed and simultaneously compared with the six-point Boezaart scale via means of a DVD in three international centers. Results: Inter and intrarater reliability of the Boezaart and new Wormald scales significantly improved by employing a standardized video-endoscopy technique. The Wormald scale had significantly higher interrater (0.80 vs. 0.74, P < .001) and intrarater (0.89 vs. 0.83, P < .001) reliability than the Boezaart scale. Linear regression analysis revealed the Wormald scale to be more sensitive to changes in the most common surgical fields experienced in ESS. Conclusion: Standardized video-endoscopy has been demonstrated to significantly improve reliability and reproducibility of results and is recommended for future work evaluating bleeding in ESS. The new Wormald grading scale has been shown to be an inexpensive, reliable, and sensitive tool to rapidly evaluate intraoperative bleeding in ESS. It overcomes several limitations of the Boezaart scale, enabling us to analyze currently employed and newly developed hemostatic methods and agents.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes the move away from tradition and using only nursing experience towards a more questioning and research supported evidence-based practice (EBP) approach in orthopaedic and trauma nursing. The migration from the more narrow and specific use of research-based practice to the broader and encompassing use of evidence on which to base guidance and care decisions is explored. Weaknesses and strengths of adopting a culture of EBP nursing are addressed along with how to develop a search question, find and appraise the evidence, make sense of it and then apply the findings.

AB  - ABSTRACT Purpose Second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are widely used for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), although without strong evidence base. With substantial numbers of veterans returning from Iraq/Afghanistan conflicts with PTSD, it is important to characterize the extent of SGA use and identify associated factors. Methods We determined time trends and patient characteristics associated with the use of SGAs in veterans with PTSD, without comorbid schizophrenia or bipolar disorders, using the Department of Veterans Affairs national administrative data 2003?2010. Results Among 732?085 veterans with PTSD, 27.6% received an intentional trial of an SGA in 2003?2010. The annual number treated with SGAs almost doubled (45?268 to 84?197, p?<?0.001), while prescribing rates decreased (28.6% to 21.5%, p?<?0.001). In multivariate analyses, African Americans (odds ratio (OR)?=?1.07, 95%confidence interval (CI)?=?1.06?1.09) and Hispanics (OR?= 1.13, 95%CI?=?1.10?1.17) were more likely to receive SGAs than Whites. Strongest clinical associations were with prior diagnosis of depression (OR?=?1.96; 95%CI?=?1.94?1.99), substance use disorders (OR?=?1.86; 95%CI?=?1.84?1.88), and other anxiety disorders (OR?=?1.27; 95%CI?=?1.26?1.29) (all p???<?0.0001) as well as cardiovascular risk factors. Veterans previously deployed to Iraq/Afghanistan had lower likelihood of SGA receipt. Substantial regional differences were demonstrated (South?>?Northeast; Midwest and West?<?Northeast; p?<?0.0001); regional administrative units (veterans integrated service networks) contributed minimally to regional differences. Conclusions Post-traumatic stress disorder population growth is driving substantial increases in SGA use. Decreasing rates of the Department of Veterans Affairs prescribing may be due to integrated system-wide mechanisms (e.g., national practice guidelines), although regional variations remain prominent. These analyses provide foundational steps for identifying modifiable provider-level and organization-level determinants of SGA prescription in this growing population. Published 2013.

AB  - Background: The incidence of awareness in patients undergoing general anesthesia is 0.1?0.2% in Western countries. The medical literatures about awareness during general anesthesia are still rare in China, but some previous studies have reported a higher incidence (1.4?6%) of intra-operative awareness. To find out the reason why the incidence reported in China is much higher than that in Western countries, we performed a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized observational study to determine the true incidence of intra-operative awareness in China. Methods: This is a prospective, non-randomized descriptive cohort study that was conducted at 25 academic medical centers in China. Eleven thousand one hundred and eighty-five patients were interviewed by research staff for evaluation of awareness at the first and fourth day after general anesthesia with muscle relaxation. An independent blinded committee evaluated the responses and determined whether awareness occurred. Necessary data were collected for a binary logistic regression analysis. Results: Data from 11,101 patients were presented. Forty-six cases (0.41%) were reported as definite awareness and 47 additional cases (0.41%) as possible awareness. Three hundred and fifty-five patients (3.19%) had dreams during general anesthesia. Awareness was associated with increased American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status, a previous anesthesia, and anesthesia methods of total intravenous anesthesia. Conclusion: The incidence of intra-operative awareness in China is approximately 0.41%, two to three times higher than that widely cited in Western countries. Inappropriately light anesthesia, and the population proportion of surgery and general anesthesia in China may account for the difference. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier, NCT00693875.)

AB  - Abstract Background The first year of prosthetic loading is crucial to peri-implant bone levels; however, contributing factors are yet barely understood. Purpose The purpose of the study is to investigate the influence of patient-, implant-, and prosthetic-related parameters on marginal bone resorption in partially edentulous patients within the first year of prosthetic loading. Materials and Methods This retrospective multifactorial analysis involved the following influencing factors: patient gender and age, implant diameter, implant location and neck design, insertion torque, insertion depth, splinted versus single-tooth restorations, crown height space, and crown-to-implant ratio. Results Mean peri-implant bone resorption around 200 dental implants was 0.98?±?0.76?mm and significantly correlated to higher implant insertion depth (p?<?.001), whereas no association to prosthetic parameters could be observed. Conclusions Within the limits of the present analysis, it can be concluded that apical implant positioning may constitute a relevant determinant of early peri-implant bone resorption.

AB  - Summary This paper describes the methodology necessary to perform a clinical exercise test and the expected variability in an individual horse's exercise test measurements based on comparing the results of two repetitions of the test with six horses. The exercise test measurements were obtained with an open flow respiratory gas analysis system, fast time response lactate analyser and an on-board heart rate monitor during an incremental inclined treadmill exercise test. With the exception of peak venous lactate concentration (LACpeak), the results indicate that the mean variability in peak oxygen consumption (V?O2peak) peak carbon dioxide production (V?CO2peak), peak respiratory exchange ratio (Rpeak), peak heart rate (HRpeak), peak packed cell volume (PCVpeak), peak total plasma protein (TPPpeak) and the maximum number of steps completed during the exercise test (STEPmax) was less than 5 per cent. Variation in the regression analysis of V?O2, V?CO2 and HR versus velocity was also less than 5 per cent. Slightly higher variation was recorded for LAC and R. Mean variation in the regression analysis of PCV and TPP versus velocity was more than 16 per cent. Mean variation for all of the post exercise test measurements was less than 10 per cent at 1, 5 and 15 mins post exercise. Therefore, the results obtained during a single exercise test are a reliable assessment of a horse's metabolic capability.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: The aim of this study is to investigate the role of social support and coping strategies in enhancing post-traumatic growth (PTG) in cancer patients. The study focused on both avoidance and approaching coping and on four distinct types of social support: (a) perceived availability, (b) actual received, (c) satisfaction with received support, and (d) the competence of caregiver to satisfy the patient's basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Methods: A longitudinal study was conducted with a group of 41 cancer patients currently in the treatment and management phase of their illness. Data were collected by means of a written questionnaire, at two time points (T1 and T2) that were 6 months apart. Social support was assessed using the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List and the Need Satisfaction in Relationship Scale. Coping strategies were assessed using the Brief COPE questionnaire. Social support and coping strategies were assessed only at T1. PTG was assessed using the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory at T1 and T2. Correlation and regression analyses were used to examine the association between social support and coping strategies with short-term reports of post-traumatic growth. Results: Regression analyses showed that autonomy-supportive caregivers and a problem-focused strategy of coping significantly predicted greater PTG at T2. Conclusions: This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the type of social support that may specifically aid cancer patients in experiencing PTG. Furthermore, findings confirm the important role of problem-focused coping strategies in growing psychologically. Copyright ? 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Trauma surgery lack, substitute, for the reconstruction of large defects of the long bones. Encouraged by the promising results of bone allotransplantation in animal models, we successfully performed vascularized bone transplantation in humans. Vascularized femoral diaphyses were allogenically transplanted into three patients suffering from chondrosarcoma or post-traumatic osteomyelitis with postoperative immunosuppression. The bone segments were harvested from multi-organ donors and perfused with UW solution. After back-table preparation, the grafts were transplanted into the defect zone. Interlocking devices were used in these operations. Vascular anastomoses were performed in end-to-side technique. The early clinical course of the patients was not free of anatomical, technical, or immunological complications. However, all patients are currently free of malignancy and infection. They are also free of pain and full weight bearing. We conclude that allogenic grafting of vascularized bone segments has the potential to become an alternative for the replacement of large bone defects.

AB  - Objective To compare cost-effectiveness of integrated care with therapeutic assertive community treatment (IC-TACT) versus standard care (SC) in multiple-episode psychosis. Method Twelve-month IC-TACT in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum and bipolar I disorders were compared with a historical control group. Primary outcomes were entropy-balanced cost-effectiveness based on mental healthcare costs from a payers? perspective and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as a measure of health effects during 12-month follow-up. Results At baseline, patients in IC-TACT (n = 214) had significantly higher illness severity and lower functioning than SC (n = 56). Over 12 months, IC-TACT had significantly lower days in inpatient (10.3 ± 20.5 vs. 28.2 ± 44.9; P = 0.005) and day-clinic care (2.6 ± 16.7 vs. 16.4 ± 33.7; P = 0.004) and correspondingly lower costs (??55 084). Within outpatient care, IC-TACT displayed a higher number of treatment contacts (116.3 ± 45.3 vs. 15.6 ± 6.3) and higher related costs (?+1417). Both resulted in lower total costs in IC-TACT (mean difference = ??13 248 ± 2975, P < 0.001). Adjusted incremental QALYs were significantly higher for IC-TACT versus SC (+0.10 ± 0.37, P = 0.05). The probability of cost-effectiveness of IC-TACT was constantly higher than 99%. Conclusion IC-TACT was cost-effective compared with SC. The use of prima facies ?costly? TACT teams is highly recommended to improve outcomes and save total cost for patients with severe psychotic disorders.

AB  - The extent and kind of personal change experienced by newcomers during organizational socialization has not been thoroughly addressed. Studies have concentrated on increases in knowledge and adjustment and neglected the influence of starting work on sense of self. Multiple methods are used to explore graduates? accounts of change in early career. Questionnaires were sent to graduates in eight different organizations on two occasions one year apart (Time 1 N = 906; Time 2 N = 936). Graduates rated the amount of change they experienced highest in competence (median: Quite a lot), followed by career (median: A little), personality (median: A moderate amount/A little), values (median: Not at all/A little) and lowest in attitudes (median: Not at all). Content analysis of open-ended comments showed that changes were generally positive or neutral rather than negative. Discourses of personal change were explored in interviews with nine graduates who were selected as most likely to have experienced change. The criteria were that they were women in sex atypical occupations with high self-ratings of personal change. Accounts demonstrated the complexity and contradictions in defining and discussing change and the dilemma in both describing change and maintaining continuity. Narratives presented change as a response to adversity involving emotional control, increased self-knowledge and increased confidence. A further theme was the personal dilemma inherent in maintaining balance between the contested identities of self at work and outside. This research contributes to our understanding of newcomers? experiences of organizational socialization by emphasizing the importance of multiple methods to understand the ambiguity and ambivalence in complex developmental processes. It highlights the elusive nature of change and the complex negotiations in establishing the sense of self in different contexts.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To analyse and evaluate the correlation between traumatic head injuries (THIs) and maxillofacial fractures (MF). Age, gender and trauma mechanism correlated with THI were also investigated. Patients and Methods We conducted a hospital-based retrospective case?control study at Stomatology College and Hospital, Wuhan University. From January 2000 to December 2009, a total of 1131 patients with MF were enrolled in the statistical study to evaluate the association of THI and other risk factors with MF. Among these patients, 86 presented with THI. We utilized binary logistic regression and risk analysis to investigate the associations among MF and other risk factors with HI. Results Head injuries (103 injuries) were sustained by 86 patients (7.6%), with male-to-female ratio of 4.1:1.0. Most of the patients (52 patients, 50.5%) also exhibited cranial bone fractures. The age group with most patients was the 30?39 years age group (26 patients, 30.2%), followed by the 19?29 years age group (22 patients, 25.6%). Motor vehicle accident (MVA) was the most common mechanism of injury (49 patients, 74.1%). Patients older than 50 years showed the highest risk for head injury (OR, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1?3.7; P = 0.025). MVA had a sixfold risk of head injury (OR, 6.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.5?26.1; P = 0.013). Head injuries were more prone to occur in patients who had combined fracture of the mid-face and mandible (OR = 4.6, P < 0.001), and only a 0.3-fold risk of multimandible fractures (P < 0.001), 0.5-fold risk of single mandibular fracture (P = 0.017) and 0.3-fold risk of patients who sustained only single mandibular condylar fracture (P = 0.019). Conclusions The occurrence of head injuries is significantly related to age, aetiology and the pattern and position of maxillofacial fractures.

Fractional anisotropy (FA) in the fornix was elevated in the mild traumatic brain injured group. Performance on the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) was lower in the group with mTBI. A relation was found between lower performance on cognitive tasks and higher FA. The potential role of fornix injury as a basis of memory and processing speed deficits in mTBI is discussed.

AB  - In contrast to traditional static cold preservation of donor livers, normothermic machine perfusion may reduce preservation injury, improve graft viability and potentially allows ex vivo assessment of graft viability before transplantation. We have studied the feasibility of normothermic machine perfusion in four discarded human donor livers. Normothermic machine perfusion consisted of pressure and temperature controlled pulsatile perfusion of the hepatic artery and continuous portal perfusion for 6 h. Two hollow fiber membrane oxygenators provided oxygenation of the perfusion fluid. Biochemical markers in the perfusion fluid reflected minimal hepatic injury and improving function. Lactate levels decreased to normal values, reflecting active metabolism by the liver (mean lactate 10.0 ± 2.3 mmol/L at 30 min to 2.3 ± 1.2 mmol/L at 6 h). Bile production was observed throughout the 6 h perfusion period (mean rate 8.16 ± 0.65 g/h after the first hour). Histological examination before and after 6 h of perfusion showed well-preserved liver morphology without signs of additional hepatocellular ischemia, biliary injury or sinusoidal damage. In conclusion, this study shows that normothermic machine perfusion of human donor livers is technically feasible. It allows assessment of graft viability before transplantation, which opens new avenues for organ selection, therapeutic interventions and preconditioning.

AB  - Aims To develop and validate a scoring method for assessing ?-amyloid precursor protein (APP) staining in cerebral white matter and to investigate the occurrence, amount and deposition pattern based on the cause of death in infants and young children. Methods Archival cerebral tissue was examined from a total of 176 cases (0 to 3 years of age). Each of the APP-stained sections was graded according to a simple scoring system based on the number and type of changes in eight anatomical regions. Results Examination of the sections revealed some degree of APP staining in 95% of the cases. The highest mean APP scores were found in cases of head trauma, and the lowest scores were found in the cases of drowning. APP staining, although sometimes minimal, was found in all 48 cases of and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Patterns of APP staining (the amount and distribution) were different in cases of head trauma, infection and SIDS but were similar in the SIDS and asphyxia groups. Conclusion This study demonstrates the use of an integrated scoring system that was developed to assess APP staining in the brain. APP staining was seen in a high proportion of cases, including relatively sudden deaths. The amount of APP was significantly higher in cases of trauma than in nontraumatic deaths. However, APP was detected within all groups. The pattern of APP staining was similar in infants who had died of SIDS and from mechanical asphyxia.

AB  - Aims Schwann cells myelinate axons of the peripheral nervous system. This process of myelination is regulated by various transcription factors. c-Jun and Sox-2 are negative regulators of myelination and control Schwann cell differentiation and plasticity. Schwannoma cells within tumours no longer express myelin markers, and show increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. We have shown previously that several signalling pathways are activated in schwannoma cells in situ, in particular the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. Both in vitro and in vivo we have demonstrated that c-Jun and Sox-2 are co-regulated in Schwann cells and evidence shows that both these proteins regulate myelination negatively. In this study, we aimed to characterize the expression of c-Jun and Sox-2 in schwannoma and traumatic neuroma. Methods and results Immunohistochemistry using antibodies to c-Jun and Sox-2 was applied to six schwannomas, and the results were compared with those seen in traumatic neuroma and normal nerve. Increased expression of c-Jun and Sox-2 was seen in schwannoma. Conclusions We have demonstrated increased expression of c-Jun and Sox-2 in schwannoma compared to traumatic neuroma. There was no expression of c-Jun and Sox-2 in a histologically normal peripheral nerve.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to determine the range of threshold responses of healthy dental pulps and test the reproducibility of the electric pulp test (EPT). Forty-nine dental students participated in the study. Sound teeth in both arches, except third molars, were included. The teeth were isolated using cotton rolls and dried with compressed air, and the threshold responses were recorded. Participants stopped the stimulus increase by pressing the switch at the first sensation of discomfort. The measurements were repeated after 30 days. The obtained data were analysed using SPSS?16.0. The mean thresholds for the maxillary incisors, canines, premolars and molars were 10.77, 21.07, 21.88 and 34.07 ?A, and for mandibular incisors, canines, premolars and molars 9.81, 18.7, 19.24 and 30.1 ?A respectively. The differences between the two measurements were statistically significant for teeth 32, 31, 41 and 42. The EPT was shown to be reproducible for all the teeth tested except mandibular incisors.

AB  - Summary Despite reports of successful pregnancies in heart transplant (HTx) recipients, many centers recommend their patients against maternity. We reviewed our provincial experience of pregnancy in HTx recipients by performing charts review of all known gestations following HTx in the province of Quebec (Canada), stratified between planned and unplanned pregnancies. Long-term survival was compared to HTx recipient women of childbearing age who did not become pregnant. Eighteen pregnancies, 56% unplanned, occurred in eight patients, 10.1 (2.6?27.0) years after HTx. Immunosuppression was CNI-based, with a mean dose increase of 48.3% (tacrolimus) and 26.5% (cyclosporine), without rejection. Cardiometabolic complications were high compared to the general Canadian population, including preeclampsia (15.4% vs. 5.5%), hypertension (38.5% vs. 4.6%), and diabetes (15.4% vs. 5.6%). Mean gestational age was 35.1 (23.4?39.6) weeks (72.2% live births; 53.8% prematurity). Mean birthweight was 2418 (660?3612) g. Serum creatinine increased during pregnancy, becoming significant after delivery (P = 0.0239), and returning to preconception level in all but three patients within a year. After 4.6 (1.2?17.2) years of follow-up, two rejection episodes occurred in one patient. Long-term mortality was similar to overall HTx women (Kaplan?Meier; P = 0.8071). Pregnancy in HTx carries high cardiometabolic complications and decreased kidney function, but is feasible with acceptable outcomes and no impact on mother's survival.
