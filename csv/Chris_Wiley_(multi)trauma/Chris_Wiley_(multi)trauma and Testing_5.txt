AB  - Abstract Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common and is a leading cause of presentations to emergency departments. Understanding the epidemiology of TBI can aid in improving overall management and identifying opportunities for prevention. Currently, there is a paucity of data on paediatric TBI in NSW. The purpose of this study was to determine the demographics, causes, treatment and outcome of TBI at The Children's Hospital at Westmead (CHW), a large trauma referral paediatric hospital. Methods A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients admitted to CHW emergency from 2006 to 2011 with a TBI. Patients who presented to the emergency department and had a history of TBI with either symptoms of concussion and/or positive computed tomography (CT) findings of head injury were selected. Information regarding demographics, injury pattern, CT findings, treatment and outcome were retrieved. Results Over the 6-year period, there were 1489 presentations at the CHW. Of these, 65% were male and 35% were female. The mean age was 7 years. A total of 93% were classified as mild, 1.5% as moderate and 5.5% as severe. Sports and recreational injuries accounted for 26% of all TBI presentations, while motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) accounted for 77% of all TBI deaths. Sixty-two per?cent of children underwent a CT brain, and of those, 40% were normal. Conclusion The majority of TBI are mild in nature, with younger children and males at greatest risk. There was a low rate of operative intervention and a high rate of good outcomes. Many injuries may be preventable with the adaptation of better public health education programmes, particularly in very young children and those related to MVAs.

AB  - Abstract Purpose Healthcare professionals who provide services in the immediate or long-term aftermath of traumatic events need to understand the nature and frequency of traumatic events in the lives of women. However, research on trauma exposure in women has only recently begun to assess events other than intimate partner and sexual violence and has not supported direct statistical comparison of cross-national and cross-cultural data. The purpose of this descriptive, correlational study was to describe and compare trauma exposure prevalence and type in community-based samples of women in the United States, Colombia, and Hong Kong. Design Women were recruited through posted notices at community health sites, snowball sampling, and online advertisements (N = 576). The Life Stressor Checklist-Revised (total score range 0 to 30) was used to determine the type and prevalence of trauma exposure. Data were collected by native language members of the research team. Methods Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic characteristics and trauma exposure for the total sample and each community-based sample (location). Between-location differences were tested using Fisher's exact tests for categorical measures and general linear models with pairwise a posteriori least squares t-test for continuous measures. Responses to open-ended questions were translated and categorized. Findings Over 99% of women in the total sample reported at least one traumatic life event. The mean number of traumatic life events per participant was 7, ranging from 0 to 24. Although there was consistency in the most commonly reported trauma exposures across locations, the rates of specific events often differed. Conclusions Historical, political, geographic, and cultural factors may explain differences in trauma exposure among women in the four locations studied. Clinical Relevance This study offers relevant knowledge for providers in diverse locations who provide services to women who have experienced traumatic events and provides evidence for the need for future research to further enhance knowledge of trauma exposure among women, and on the effects of trauma in women's lives.

AB  - As with all areas of medicine, high-quality clinical research is essential to improving the care of trauma patients. This research is crucial in developing evidence-based treatments that decrease cost, decrease morbidity, and improve mortality. Trauma continues to extract a significant toll on society and is the single largest cause of years of life lost in the United States. The need to conduct high-quality clinical research in trauma is not disputed. However, significant challenges and barriers unique to the field of trauma make performing this research more difficult. It is critical to be aware of these challenges and barriers to performing clinical research involving trauma patients so these challenges can be accounted for and solutions implemented to minimize their impact on research. This review will focus on the barriers and challenges that are encountered while performing clinical research in trauma.

AB  - Background Death after injury with low energy has gained increasing focus lately, and seems to constitute a significant amount of trauma-related death. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of deaths from low-energy trauma in a rural Norwegian cohort. Methods All deaths from external causes in Finnmark County, Norway, from 1995 to 2004 were identified retrospectively through the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry. Deaths caused by hanging, drowning, suffocation, poisoning, and electrocution were excluded. Trauma was categorised as high energy or low energy based on mechanism of injury. All low-energy trauma deaths were then reviewed. Results There were 262 cases of trauma death during the period. Low-energy trauma counted for 43% of the trauma deaths, with an annual crude death rate of 13 per 100,000 inhabitants. Low falls accounted for 99% of the injuries. Fractures were sustained in 89% of cases and head injuries in 11%. Ninety per cent of patients had pre-existing medical conditions, and the median age was 82 years. Death was caused by a medical condition in 85% of cases. Fifty-two per cent of the patients died after discharge from the hospital. Conclusion In this cohort, low-energy trauma was a significant contributor to trauma related death, especially among elderly and patients with pre-existing medical conditions.

AB  - Abstract. Objective: To determine the utility of the ED physical examination and laboratory analysis in screening hospitalized pediatric blunt trauma patients for intra-abdominal injuries (IAIs). Methods: The authors reviewed the records of all patients aged <15 years who sustained blunt traumatic injury and were admitted to a Level 1 trauma center over a four-year period. Patients were considered high-risk for IAI if they had any of the following at ED presentation: decreased level of consciousness (GCS < 15), abdominal pain, tenderness on abdominal examination, or gross hematuria. Patients without any of these findings were considered moderate risk for IAI. The authors compared moderate-risk patients with and without IAIs with regard to physical examination and laboratory findings obtained in the ED. Results: Of 1,040 children with blunt trauma, 559 (54%) were high-risk and 481 (46%) were moderate-risk for IAI. 126 (23%) of the high-risk and 22 (4.6%) of the moderate-risk patients had IAIs. Among moderate-risk patients with and without IAIs, those with IAIs were more likely to have abdominal abrasions (5/22 vs 34/459, p = 0.008), an abnormal chest examination (11/22 vs 86/457, p = 0.01), higher mean serum concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (604 U/L vs 77 U/L, p < 0.001) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (276 U/L vs 39 U/L, p = 0.002), higher mean white blood cell (WBC) counts (16.3 K/mm3 vs 12.8 K/mm3, p < 0.001), and a higher prevalence of >5 RBCs/hpf on urinalysis (7/22 vs 54/427, p = 0.02). There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) between moderate-risk patients with and without IAIs in initial serum concentrations of amylase, initial hematocrit, drop in hematocrit >5 percentage points in the ED, or initial serum bicarbonate concentrations. Conclusion: In children hospitalized for blunt torso trauma who are at moderate risk for IAI, ED findings of abdominal abrasions, an abnormal chest examination, and microscopic hematuria as well as elevated levels of AST and ALT, and elevated WBC count are associated with IAI.

AB  - Summary An animal trauma triage (ATT) scoring system was devised to provide stratification of veterinary trauma patient populations based upon severity of injury. A retrospective population of 101 trauma patients and a prospective population of 88 patients were used to evaluate the predictive power of the ATT scoring system for survival seven days after initial presentation of the emergency service. In Both groups, the mean ATT score for survivors was significantly lower than the mean ATT score for non-survivors. In a logistic regression mode, the ATT score was found to be a significant predictor of the likelihood of survival seven days after initial presentation for both populartions. Each point increase in the ATT score resulted in a 2.3?2.6 times decreased likelihood of survival. The ATT scoring system is a useful objective classification scheme for predicting the likelihood to survive a traumatic incident and can serve as prototype for severity of injuroy scoring systems for the veterinary trauma patient.

AB  - Blast-induced traumatic brain injury is on the rise, predominantly as a result of the use of improvised explosive devices, resulting in undesirable neuropsychological dysfunctions, as demonstrated in both animals and humans. This study investigated the effect of open-field blast injury on the rat brain using multi-echo, susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). Multi-echo SWI provided phase maps with better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), making it a sensitive technique for brain injury. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a survivable blast of 180 kPa. The visibility of blood vessels of varying sizes improved with multi-echo SWI. Reduced signal intensity from major vessels post-blast indicates increased deoxyhaemoglobin. Relative cerebral blood flow was computed from filtered phase SWI images using inferred changes in oxygen saturation from major blood vessels. Cerebral blood flow decreased significantly at day 3 and day 5 post-blast compared with that pre-blast. This was substantiated by the upregulation of ?-amyloid precursor protein (?-APP), a marker of ischaemia, in the neuronal perikaya of the cerebral cortex, as observed by immunofluorescence, and in the cortical tissue by western blot analysis. Our findings indicate the presence of brain ischaemia in post-blast acute phase of injury with possible recovery subsequently. Our results from cerebrovascular imaging, histology and staining provide an insight into the ischaemic state of the brain post-blast and may be useful for prognosis and outcome.

AB  - Background Genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be conferred by the susceptibility polymorphism apolipoprotein E (APOE), where the ε4 allele increases the risk of developing late-onset AD but is not a definitive predictor of the disease, or by autosomal dominant mutations (eg, the presenilins), which almost inevitably result in early-onset familial AD. The purpose of this study was to compare the psychological impact of using these two different types of genetic information to disclose genetic risk for AD to family members of affected patients. Methods Data were compared from two separate protocols. The Risk Evaluation and Education for Alzheimer's Disease (REVEAL) Study is a randomized, multi-site clinical trial that evaluated the impact of susceptibility testing for AD with APOE in 101 adult children of AD patients. A separate study, conducted at the University of Washington, assessed the impact of deterministic genetic testing by disclosing presenilin-1, presenilin-2, or TAU genotype to 22 individuals at risk for familial AD or frontotemporal dementia. In both protocols, participants received genetic counseling and completed the impact of event scale (IES), a measure of test-specific distress. Scores were analyzed at the time point closest to 1 year after disclosure at which IES data were available. The role of genetic test result (positive vs negative) and type of genetic testing (deterministic vs susceptibility) in predicting log-transformed IES scores were assessed with linear regression, controlling for age, gender, and time from disclosure. Results Subjects from the REVEAL Study who learned that they were positive for the susceptibility gene APOE ε4+ experienced similar, low levels of test-specific distress compared with those who received positive results of deterministic testing in the University of Washington study (P = .78). APOE ε4+ individuals in the susceptibility protocol experienced more test-specific distress than those who tested ε4? in the same study (P = .04); however, among those receiving deterministic test disclosure, the subjects who received positive results did not experience significantly higher levels of distress when compared with those who received negative results (P = .88). Conclusions The findings of this preliminary study, with limited sample size, suggest that the test-related distress experienced by those receiving positive results for a deterministic mutation is similar to the distress experienced by those receiving positive results from genetic susceptibility testing, and that the majority of participants receiving genotype disclosure do not experience clinically significant distress as indicated by IES scores 1 year after learning of their test results.

AB  - Abstract In poly-traumatic patients, second hits are known to potentiate the posttraumatic systemic inflammatory response, thus increasing the risk of multi-organ dysfunction. In accordance with ?damage control orthopaedic surgery? principles, fractures are initially treated with external fixators, which are replaced by internal osteosynthesis once the immunological status of the patient is considered stable. Recently, we demonstrated that a severe trauma impaired the healing of fractures stabilized by external fixation during the entire healing period. The question arose, whether switching to intramedullary nailing increases the inflammatory response in terms of a second hit, leading to a further impairment of bone healing. Wistar rats received a femoral osteotomy stabilized by an external fixator. Simultaneously half of the rats underwent an additional thoracic trauma. After 4 days, the external fixator was replaced by an intramedullary nail in half of the rats of the two groups. The inflammatory response was evaluated by measuring serum C5a levels. Fracture healing was determined by three-point-bending, µCT, and histomorphometry. The thoracic trauma significantly increased C5a concentrations 6, 24, and 72?h after the second surgical intervention. After 40 days, conversion to intramedullary nailing considerably decreased the flexural rigidity of the callus, with no significant differences between rats with or without thoracic trauma. After 47 days, flexural rigidity in rats subjected to conversion remained decreased compared to animals solely treated by external fixation, particularly in combination with blunt chest trauma. The results indicate that accumulation of second hits after multiple injuries could lead to aggravation of the fracture healing outcome. ? 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society.

The aim of this study was to describe the longer term independent living and return to work outcomes following severe pelvic ring fracture. Methods Adult survivors to discharge from two major trauma centres with AO/Tile type B and C fractures were followed up at 6, 12 and 24-months post-injury to capture functional (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended [GOS-E]) and return to work data. Multivariable, mixed effects models were used to identify predictors of outcome. Results A total of 111 of 114 (97%) cases were followed up. The mean (SD) age of participants was 41.9 (18.9) years, 77% were male, 81% were transport-related and 90% were multi-trauma patients. Further, 11% were managed conservatively, 10% with external fixation and 79% with open reduction and internal fixation. At 24 months, 77% were living independently (GOS-E > 4) and 59% had returned to work. Higher Injury Severity Scores (ISS) were associated with lower risk-adjusted odds of return to work (P = 0.04) and independent living (P = 0.06). Post-operative infection was associated with living independently (P = 0.02). Conclusion Despite the severity of the injuries sustained, 77% of severe pelvic ring fracture patients were living independently and 59% had returned to work, 2-years post-injury. Fracture type and management were not key predictors of outcome. Large-scale multi-centre studies are needed to fully understand the burden of severe pelvic ring fractures and to guide clinical management.

AB  - Abstract Hundreds of thousands of children are confronted with traumatic experiences each year in the United States. As trauma-informed care begins to take hold in schools, school mental health providers (e.g., school psychologists, counselors, and social workers) desire concrete service-delivery options for students affected by trauma. This article provides examples from the literature via a narrative review of assessment, intervention, and practitioner support options related to childhood trauma. Specific attention is paid to framing concrete school-based trauma service-delivery options within a multitiered systems of support model to align with existing school practices. Given the large amount of literature on this topic, this article aims to reduce the barriers practitioners face when looking to implement trauma services in their schools by organizing example practices from the literature in a commonly used service-delivery framework.

AB  - Abstract Objective Women veterans have a higher prevalence of chronic pain relative to men. One hypothesis is that differential combat and traumatic sexual experiences and attenuated levels of social support between men and women may differentially contribute to the development and perpetuation of pain. This investigation examined [1] gender differences in trauma, social support, and family conflict among veterans with chronic pain, and [2] whether trauma, social support, and family conflict were differentially associated with pain severity, pain interference, and depressive symptom severity as a function of gender. Methods Participants included 460 veterans (56% female) who served in support of recent conflicts, and who endorsed pain lasting 3 months or longer. Participants completed a baseline survey during participation in a longitudinal investigation. Self-report measures included pain severity, pain interference, depressive symptom severity, exposure to traumatic life events, emotional and tangible support, and family conflict. Results Relative to men, women veterans reporting chronic pain evidenced higher rates of childhood interpersonal trauma (51% vs 34%; P?<?0.001) and military sexual trauma (54% vs 3%; P?<?0.001), along with lower levels of combat exposure (10.00 vs 16.85, P?<?0.001). Gender was found to be a moderator of the association of marital status, combat exposure, childhood interpersonal trauma, and family conflict with pain interference. It also moderated family conflict in the prediction of depressive symptoms. Conclusions Results underscore the potential importance of developing and testing gender specific models of chronic pain that consider the relative roles of trauma, social support, and family conflict.

AB  - Summary Tranexamic acid is used both pre-hospital and in-hospital as an antifibrinolytic drug to treat or prevent hyperfibrinolysis in trauma patients; dosing, however, remains empirical. We aimed to measure plasma levels of tranexamic acid in patients receiving pre-hospital anti-hyperfibrinolytic therapy and to build a population pharmacokinetic model to propose an optimised dosing regimen. Seventy-three trauma patients were enrolled and each received tranexamic acid 1 g intravenously pre-hospital. A blood sample was drawn after arrival in the emergency department, and we measured the plasma tranexamic acid concentration using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and modelled the data using non-linear mixed effect modelling. Tranexamic acid was administered at a median (IQR [range]) time of 43 (30?55 [5?135]) min after trauma. Plasma tranexamic acid levels were determined on arrival at hospital, 57 (43?70 [20?148]) min after pre-hospital administration of the drug. The measured concentration was 28.7 (21.5?38.5 [8.7?89.0]) ?g.ml?1. Our subjects had sustained severe trauma; injury severity score 20 (16?29 [5?75]), including penetrating injury in 2.8% and isolated traumatic brain injury in 19.7%. The pharmacokinetics were ascribed a two-compartment open model with body-weight as the main covariate. As tranexamic acid concentrations may fall below therapeutic levels during initial hospital treatment, we propose additional dosing schemes to maintain a specific target blood concentration for as long as required. This is the first study to investigate plasma level and pharmacokinetics of tranexamic acid after pre-hospital administration in trauma patients. Our proposed dosing regimen could be used in subsequent clinical trials to better study efficacy and tolerance profiles with controlled blood concentrations.

AB  - Abstract: Blunt abdominal trauma is the commonest cause of intra-abdominal injuries in children. The use of computerized axial tomography and non-operative management of haemoperitoneum are two significant developments in the last two decades in the management of blunt abdominal trauma in children. The concept of non-operative management was introduced in late 1979 and wherever possible remains the optimum treatment. Computerized tomography scan for paediatric abdominal trauma was first described in 1980 and remains the investigation of choice. There is no substitute, however, for a good history, astute physical examination, and strict adherence to the principles of primary and secondary survey, prompt resuscitation, vigilant monitoring and repeated evaluation.

AB  - Existing research suggests that approximately 19% of females experience childhood sexual trauma (CST). Little is known, however, about the parenting behaviour of mothers who have experienced CST. Using propensity-matched controls, the present study examines prenatal psychosocial distress, postnatal depressive symptomatology, and caregiving behaviours of women reporting CST at or before the age of 14. Data for these analyses were obtained from mother reports and from observational protocols from a longitudinal study of low-income, rural families. Propensity score methodology was used to create a contrast group matched on family of origin variables in an effort to isolate and examine the long-term associations of CST beyond the effects of other childhood adversities such as poverty. Study findings provide evidence that women with CST histories report greater prenatal psychosocial distress compared to women without trauma histories. Findings further provide evidence for a spillover process from prenatal distress to the broader caregiving system including less sensitive parenting through postnatal depressive symptoms for women with CST histories. These results highlight the importance of screening for CST and psychosocial distress and depression prenatally. Interventions for women with CST histories and directions for future study are proposed. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - ABSTRACT Current designs of leg-lengthening implants have faced serious failures due to inadequacies in the mechanical design. The failure typically is the result of fatigue induced by a combined loading condition with axial and shear components acting in the tubular body of the implant. One of the reasons leading to the failure is improper verification testing for the design of the fatigue limit. The current test standards for pre-clinical design phases of nail implants are relatively straightforward and widely accepted yet cannot produce the three-dimensional stress state representative of the anticipated operation in a patient during the consolidation phase. This work introduces a major improvement toward a method for verifying fatigue life of tubular as well as solid implants under combined torque, axial load, and bending. The report describes a new loading fixture, a calibration method, and compares the qualification results of finite element simulation analyses and experimental measurements during cyclic loading tests. The findings state that the fixture produces controlled multi-axial loadings to study varied osteotomy locations, quasi-static strength and fatigue of intramedullary implants at an intermediate, 2?Hz, cycle rate. ? 2019 The Authors.

AB  - This is the first controlled study of an expressive arts group intervention with unaccompanied minor asylum seeking children. The aim of the study was to examine whether such an intervention may alleviate symptoms of trauma and enhance life satisfaction and hope. One hundred forty five unaccompanied minor refugee boys with their stated age between 15 and 18 were allocated into a 10 session 5 weeks manualized expressive arts intervention (EXIT) or a life as usual (LAU) control group. The participants were assessed at onset and 4 times over a period of 25 months with a battery of instruments measuring post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), general psychological distress (HSCL-25A), current life satisfaction (CLS) and expected life satisfaction (ELS). The instruments were presented in the participants? native languages, using touch-screen laptops and the computer program Multilingual Computer Assisted Interview (MultiCASI). There were significant time by group interactions in favor of the EXIT group for PTSS and CLS. At the end of the follow up the EXIT group had higher life satisfaction and hope for the future than the LAU group. A manualized EXIT group intervention can have a beneficial effect on helping minor refugee boys to cope with symptoms of trauma, strengthen their life satisfaction and develop hope for the future. Our findings support previous studies showing that the arts may help people in reconstructing meaning and connection with others by focusing on resources and creativity.

AB  - Objective To detail the 9-year experience of renal trauma at a modern Level 1 trauma centre and report on patterns of injury, management and complications. Patients and methods We analysed 338 patients with renal injuries who presented to our institution over a 9-year period. Data on demographics, clinical presentation, management and complications were recorded. Results Males comprised 74.9% of patients with renal injuries and the highest incidence was amongst those aged 20?24 years. Blunt injuries comprised 96.2% (n = 325) of all the renal injuries, with road trauma being the predominant mechanism accounting for 72.5% of injuries. The distribution of injury grade was; 21.6% grade 1 (n = 73), 24.3% grade 2 (n = 82), 24.9% grade 3 (n = 84), 16.6% grade 4 (n = 56), and 12.7% grade 5 (n = 43). Conservative management was successful in all grade 1 and 2 renal injuries, and 94.9%, 90.7% and 35.1% of grade 3, 4 and 5 injuries respectively. All but one of the 13 patients with penetrating injuries were successfully managed conservatively. Conclusions Road trauma is the greatest cause of renal injury. Most haemodynamically stable patients are successfully managed conservatively.

AB  - ABSTRACT Maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following trauma exposure during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of affective disorders in children. To investigate the mechanisms by which prenatal trauma and/or maternal PTSD affect brain development and behavior we established a mouse model of prenatal traumatic (PT) experience based on the application of an electric foot shock to C57Bl/6N female mice on the gestational day 12 during their pregnancy. The model is based on a previously validated animal model of PTSD. We found high anxiety levels and poor maternal care along with reduced serum prolactin and increased corticosterone levels in dams following maternal trauma (MT). PT-pups were born smaller and stayed smaller throughout their life. We show increased time and frequency of ultrasonic calls in PT-pups when separated from the mothers on the postnatal day (PND) 9. Cross-fostering experiments reveal lower anxiety levels in PT pups raised by healthy mothers as compared to trauma-naive pups raised by MT-dams. Importantly, the combination of prenatal trauma and being raised by a traumatized mother leads to: (1) the highest corticosterone levels in pups, (2) longest USV-call time and (3) highest anxiety levels in comparison to other experimental groups. Our data indicates a distinct change in maternal care following MT which is possibly associated with trauma-induced decrease in prolactin levels. Furthermore, we show that maternal behavior is crucial for the development of the offspring anxiety and specific aspects in maternal care overwrite to a significant extend the effects of in utero and postnatal environment. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
