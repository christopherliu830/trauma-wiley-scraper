AB  - Abstract Background Few prospective studies about early loading of short implant have been available and very little evidence exists on the outcomes longer than 3 years. Purpose To assess clinical and radiographic outcomes of 6 mm-short implants placed in the posterior maxilla and mandible applying an early loading protocol. Materials and methods Ninety-five short implants (6 mm-short, ? 4 mm) were placed in 45 subjects at 3 study sites, 2 or 3 implants per subject, using a one-stage surgical procedure and loaded with a screw-retained splinted fixed prosthesis 6 weeks later. Follow-up took place at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after loading. Marginal bone level changes, implant survival, clinical variables, and adverse events were assessed. Results The survival rate for all implants placed was 95.8%. From implant loading to 3 years follow-up, mean marginal bone level changes were minimal (0.07?±?0.49 mm) and the peri-implant soft tissue status was healthy. No major technical or biological complications occurred except for the 4 early implant losses. Conclusion Three-year data indicates that the use of splinted 6 mm-short implants is a viable treatment in posterior regions with low marginal bone resorption. Early loading after 6 weeks should be taken cautiously in patients with known risk factors.

AB  - The existence of seasonal patterns to patch test reactions has been described, but with conflicting causal interpretations. The potential seasonality of patch tests may be due to irritation, changes to skin barrier or changes to immunological functions caused by meteorological fluctuations. For example, increased skin irritability due to cold winter weather and low humidity may cause an increase in irritative/doubtful and weak positive (false positive) reactions. To investigate the extent of the association between weather and patch test results, consecutive patients (N?=?73691) patch tested with the standard series of the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG) at German or Austrian IVDK (http://www.ivdk.de) centres were matched with weather data collected at a nearby (30?km radius) weather station. Temperature and absolute humidity (AH) on the day of patch test application and the two preceding days were averaged to represent the environment most likely to have influenced the skin condition at the time of testing. The results of 24 standard series substances were analyzed with multivariate logistic regression. Half of the standard series substances examined, including fragrance mix, nickel sulphate, and formaldehyde, exhibited evidence of a relationship with meteorological conditions. Fragrance mix and p-Phenylene diamine exhibited the strongest evidence of an association to weather, with the odds of the reactions in all three reaction categories (ir/?, +, ++/+++) increasing during winter conditions. Due to the association between weather and patch test reactivity, the potential effect of meteorological conditions should be considered in the interpretation of patch test reactions.

AB  - Abstract This review covers the most recent clinical and surgical advances made in the development and application of cochlear implants (CIs). In recent years, dramatic progress has been made in both clinical and basic science aspect of cochlear implantation. Today's modern CI uses multi-channel electrodes with highly miniaturized powerful digital processing chips. This review article describes the function of various components of the modern multi-channel CIs. A selection of the most recent clinical and surgical innovations is presented. This includes the preliminary results with electro-acoustic stimulation or hybrid devices and ongoing basic science research that is focused on the preservation of residual hearing post-implantation. The result of an original device that uses a binaural stimulation mode with a single implanted receiver/stimulator is also presented. The benefit and surgical design of a temporalis pocket technique for the implant's receiver stimulator is discussed. Advances in biomedical engineering and surgical innovations that lead to an increasingly favorable clinical outcome and to an expansion of the indication of CI surgery are presented and discussed.

AB  - Fourth-year medical students in emergency medicine (EM) clerkships are evaluated by various methods. Multiple choice examinations are frequently used to supplement clinical evaluations. These are limited in their ability to evaluate students? clinical reasoning skills. The Script Concordance Test (SCT) is an innovative assessment method developed to evaluate clinical reasoning. The SCT consists of a series of clinical vignettes, each followed by a series of specific questions that present an additional piece of data (a lab result, a physical finding, etc.) to the student. The students then indicate how the additional data affect their thinking regarding a possible diagnosis, an investigational strategy, or a therapeutic intervention, using a 5 point Likert scale (-2,-1,0,+1,+2). SCT questions have no single correct answer; instead, students receive credit based upon the level of agreement between their answers and those of a panel of 10 to 20 expert physicians who take the test to derive the answer key. The SCT is easily administered. In other disciplines, the SCT has demonstrated the ability to differentiate between the clinical reasoning skills of experienced and novice clinicians. The clerkship directors developed an EM SCT using an expert panel of 10 EM attending physicians. For the 07-08 academic year, SCT questions have been incorporated into the EM clerkship end-of-rotation written examination. The EM SCT shows promise as a measure of a student's clinical reasoning ability. Future studies will assess in greater detail the performance and statistical properties of the SCT in the setting of the EM clerkship.

AB  - A trend is observed towards more specialized training and selection into talent programs at an early age for youth athletes. Little is known how this might influence the risk of illness and injury. The aim of the study was to assess whether, in a group of youth elite athletes, those specializing early or performing best were at increased risk of incurring injury or illness after entering a specialized Sport Academy High School program. We enrolled 259 16-year-old elite athletes. They completed a baseline web-based questionnaire covering their age at specialization, single- versus multi-sport involvement during the previous 2 years and current performance level (rated by themselves and their coach). Subsequently, the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Centre (OSTRC) questionnaire on health problems was used to self-report injuries and illnesses weekly for 26 weeks from October to May. In this specialized Sport Academy High School program, 39% of the athletes reported early specialization (at 12 years or younger). However, early specialization did not increase the risk of injury or illness during the 26 weeks, nor did being a single-sport athlete the previous two years increase this risk. The best performing athletes at the time of enrollment were not at greater risk of becoming injured or ill during the 26 weeks. In conclusion, in a group of youth elite athletes entering a specialized Sport Academy High School program neither early single-sport specialization nor performance level appears to represent risk factors for injury or illness after enrollment.

AB  - Summary.? von Willebrand?s disease (VWD) is an inherited bleeding disorder characterized by deficient levels of or dysfunctional von Willebrand factor (VWF). This phase II/III open-label, multicentre study evaluated the efficacy and safety of BIOSTATE?, a high purity plasma-derived double-virus inactivated FVIII/VWF concentrate, when used in non-surgical bleeds, surgical procedures and prophylactic therapy in VWD patients for whom desmopressin treatment was deemed ineffective, inadequate or contraindicated. Twenty three patients (7 type 1, 9 type 2 and 7 type 3; 12 male, 11 female), who received FVIII/VWF concentrate as part of their VWD management, were recruited prospectively between December 2004 and May 2007 from eight centres in Australia and New Zealand. BIOSTATE dosing was based on pre-treatment FVIII:C and/or VWF:RCo plasma levels and a predetermined dosing guide. Haemostatic efficacy of BIOSTATE was rated as excellent or good for all major and minor surgery events, long-term prophylaxis, and for four of the six assessable non-surgical bleeding events. Blood transfusions were required by two major surgery patients as well as one patient with a non-surgical bleed. The median overall exposure to BIOSTATE across all groups was 8?days, greater in the prophylactic group (range 53?197) compared with major surgery (3?24), minor surgery (1?8) and non-surgical bleeds (1?10). BIOSTATE was shown to be efficacious and well tolerated when treating patients with VWD. This study also provides important insights into dosing regimens with BIOSTATE and the role of monitoring therapy with FVIII:C and VWF:RCo.

AB  - Massive transfusion protocols became common practice between 2006 and 2010. The terminology of ?massive transfusion protocol? was improved to ?massive haemorrhage protocol (MHP)? with the astute recognition that at the start of such a protocol, it is unclear which patients will meet the definition of massive transfusion (10 U/24 h). Despite the majority of the literature being reported from the trauma population, hospitals have generally adopted a single MHP for all patients. It remains unclear whether the same protocol can be used for all patients. MHPs assist with the prevention and management of the acute coagulopathy of trauma/shock (ACOTS). The goals of a MHP are to improve haemostasis, communication and patient outcomes. The protocol must be specific for an individual hospital, depending on factors such as prehospital transport times, distance from laboratory to trauma and operating rooms, patient populations served and types of tests available. The key components of a MHP are the 6Ts: triggering of the protocol, laboratory testing, tranexamic acid, temperature maintenance, transfusion support and termination of the protocol when haemostasis is achieved. The evidence and importance of each of these steps will be discussed in detail. It is also critical that a quality assurance programme supports the MHP. Poor compliance with the institutional MHP is associated with inferior survival. Each MHP activation should be followed by a formal debrief by the team. Audits should be performed to determine compliance and to inform annual update of the MHP. Formal training and/or simulation should be a core part of the policy.

AB  - Background and purpose Treatments to facilitate recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI) are urgently needed. We conducted a 9-month pilot, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial to examine the safety and potential effects of the herbal supplement MLC901 (NeuroAiD II?) on cognitive functioning following TBI. Methods Adults aged 18?65 years at 1?12 months after mild or moderate TBI were randomized to receive MLC901 (0.8 g capsules 3 times daily) or placebo for 6 months. The primary outcome was cognitive functioning as assessed by the CNS Vital Signs online neuropsychological test. Secondary outcomes included the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, the Rivermead Post-concussion Symptom Questionnaire (neurobehavioral sequelae), Quality of Life after Brain Injury, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale and extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (physical disability). Assessments were completed at baseline and at 3-, 6- and 9-month follow-up. Linear mixed-effects models were conducted, with the primary outcome time-point of 6 months. Results A total of 78 participants [mean age 37.5 ± 14.8 years, 39 (50%) female] were included in the analysis. Baseline variables were similar between groups (treatment group, n = 36; control group, n = 42). Linear mixed-effects models controlling for time, group allocation, repeated measurements, adherence and baseline assessment scores revealed significant improvements in complex attention (P = 0.04, d = 0.6) and executive functioning (P = 0.04, d = 0.4) at 6 months in the MLC901 group compared with controls. There were no significant differences between the groups for neurobehavioral sequelae, mood, fatigue, physical disability or overall quality of life at 6 months. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions MLC901 was safe and well tolerated post-TBI. This study provided Class I/II evidence that, for patients with mild to moderate TBI, 6 months of MLC901 improved cognitive functioning.

AB  - Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients with comorbid panic disorder (PD) may express additive symptoms of central fear system disturbance. They endorse elevated levels of sleep and nightmare disturbance [Leskin GA, et al., J Psychiatr Res 2002;36:449?452], and demonstrate movement suppression during laboratory sleep [Woodward SH, et al., Sleep 2002;25:681?688]. We estimated respiratory rate and rate variability separately for rapid-eye movement (REM) and non-rapid-eye movement (NREM) sleep. Subjects were 49 Vietnam combat-related PTSD inpatients (11 with comorbid PD and 38 without) and 15 controls. Computer-based estimates of respiratory rate and variability were derived from 10 to 18 hr of baseline sleep collected over two or three nights. Neither rate nor rate variability distinguished PTSD patients with comorbid PD from those without, or PTSD patients from controls; however, PTSD patients failed to exhibit the expected differences between REM and NREM respiratory rates. Moreover, the difference between REM and NREM respiratory rate was inversely related to a continuous measure of PTSD severity. PTSD patients with trauma-related nightmare complaint exhibited higher sleep respiration rates over both REM and NREM sleep. Conversely, in addition to slowed respiration, nightmare-free patients exhibited reduced respiratory rate variability in REM relative to NREM sleep, which was a reversal of the normal pattern. These finding are discussed in light of known telencephalic regulatory influences upon respiration rate. Depression and Anxiety 18:198?204, 2003 ? 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Any discussion of the regulation of effector class must include feedback control on the magnitude of the response. The induced effector activities are biodestructive and ridding. They are, in and of themselves, unspecific with respect to self and nonself. Consequently all responses include some level of innocent bystander pathology. The regulation of magnitude is essential to keeping this level of pathology at an evolutionarily acceptable level. This is my postulated role of suppressor T-cells, more popularly referred to as Treg. In order to perform this function they must be somatically selected to be anti-nonself like all other T/B-cells. If correct, any role that they might play in determining normal tolerance is excluded. As the commentary of Ellestad illustrates, their function to regulate autoimmunity is the consensus view today and, therefore, this competing concept and my analysis of suggested papers should invite a wide ranging debate.

AB  - Abstract Cognitive deficits after a traumatic brain injury can result in significant functional limitations in all areas of daily living. An individual's ability to generalize learning may be limited, thus making it harder to live independently in the community. Assessing a client's metacognitive skills and awareness level may help to establish a baseline understanding about the supervision required and the most suitable living arrangements. This study describes a multicontextual, community re-entry occupational therapy programme directed at awareness training and compensation for cognitive problems in a 34-year-old man with traumatic brain injury. Intervention consisted of metacognitive training, exploration and use of effective processing strategies, task gradations and practice of functional activities in multiple environmental contexts. Strategies such as self-prediction, self-monitoring, role reversal and the use of checklists were used. Results after six months of intervention show improvements in the client's awareness level, enhancement of his occupational function, increased satisfaction with performance and a decrease in the level of attendant care. Additional studies are recommended to validate the findings. Copyright ? 2001 Whurr Publishers Ltd.

This article briefly describes the winding journey of three investigators, two Kuwaitis, a sociologist and the other asocial work researcher, and one American psychologist. Their goal was to tale the emotional pulse of Kuwait in the shadows of fifteen years of Iraq-induced trauma. Along the way they adopt an indigenous focus that lead them to invent a measure of Raha (wellbeing) especially suited for studying Kuwaitis. The latter portion of the paper describes the procedures and results of the development of the Kuwaiti Raha Scale, ending with a discussion of the implications for international research in the social sciences. This study was funded by the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Science (KFAS).

Methods:? Pregnancy records of 409 pregnants were reviewed. Patients were screened for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) with one-hour 50?g glucose challenge test (GCT) at 24?28?weeks of gestation. Patients with glucose challenge tests values?≥?130?mg/dL were refered for the 3?h, 100-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Positive GCT but negative for OGTT group (Group A) were compared retrospectively with the group of negative GCT (Group B) for obstetrics outcomes. Result:? GDM and impared glucose tolerance (IGT) were diagnosed in 33 (7.6%) and 46 (10.5%) patients, respectively. We identified 141 (34.4%) patients with positive GCT but negative for OGTT (Group A) and 189 (46.2%) patients with negative GCT (Group B). Gestational weight gain, polyhydramnios, family history of diabetes mellitus were significantly higher in group A than group B (P?<?0.05). Prevalance of preterm labor, hypertension, cesarean delivery, mean birthweight, proportion of babies admitted to neonatal intensive care unit were similar in both groups. Conclusion:? There are some differences for pregnancy outcomes between pregnants with positive GCT but negative for OGTT and negative GCT. These patients should be followed up carefully during the antepartum and intrapartum period.

Method This was a cross-sectional study from the MELoR study consisting of a representative group of 1011 community-dwelling older persons (57% female), mean age 86.5 (54?94) years; 313 were Malays, 367 Chinese and 330 Indians. Participants were asked if they had knee pain. Levels of serum 25-hydroxy cholecalciferol (25-[OH]D), an indicator of vitamin D status, were measured using routine laboratory techniques. Results In unadjusted analysis, presence of knee pain was significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency (odds ratio [OR] 1.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08?1.85, P 0.011). Vitamin D levels were significantly associated with ethnicity differences where Malays (OR 7.08; 95% CI 4.94?10.15) and Indians (OR 6.10; 95% CI 4.28?9.71) have lower levels of vitamin D compared to Chinese. Subsequent multivariate analysis revealed that the association between vitamin D deficiency and knee pain was confounded by ethnic differences. Conclusion A previous study suggested that vitamin D deficiency was associated with knee pain. This relationship was reproduced in our study, but we further established that the association was explained by ethnic variations. As vitamin D status is dependent on skin tone, diet and sunlight exposure, which are all effected by ethnicity, future studies are now required to determine whether a true relationship exists between vitamin D and knee pain.

AB  - Background:? According to The American Pain Society, pain should be considered a fifth vital sign. Pain is a prominent feature of venous leg ulcerations (VLUs). Sixty-five percent of VLU patients complain of severe pain. In several multicenter clinical trials, Apligraf, a bioengineered living skin construct, has been shown to accelerate healing in venous leg ulcerations. Anecdotal clinical observations suggest that Apligraf treatment is associated with pain relief. A treatment modality which promotes healing and reduces pain would significantly improve the quality of life in patients with VLU. Methods:? VLU patients with pain scores greater than 5/10 on a numerical scale or requiring narcotic analgesia were randomized to receive either Apligraf and compression or compression alone. There was a 3-week ?wash-out? period to ensure that pain was not due to other factors such as inadequate compression or infection. Patients were enrolled only after a negative quantitative biopsy. The intensity of pain was self-scored and a quality-of-life questionnaire was completed at each visit. Weekly wound area measurements were obtained with digital planimetry. Results:? Thus far in the enrollment period we have already seen a trend toward a significant reduction in pain in the Apligraf group. This pain relief occurs shortly after application indicating that a mechanism distinct from clinical healing. The Apligraf group also demonstrated acceleration in wound healing as well as a decreased time-to-complete closure. Conclusion:? Interval analysis of this multicenter trial suggests that Apligraf accelerates wound healing and reduces the pain associated with venous leg ulcerations. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Summary Up to 75% of pre-hospital trauma patients experience moderate to severe pain but this is often poorly recognised and treated with insufficient analgesia. Using multi-level logistic regression analysis, we aimed to identify the determinants of pre-hospital analgesia administration and choice of analgesic agent in a single helicopter-based emergency medical service, where available analgesic drugs were fentanyl and ketamine. Of the 1156 patients rescued for isolated limb injury, 657 (57%) received analgesia. Mean (SD) initial pain scores (as measured by a numeric rating scale) were 2.8 (1.8), 3.3 (1.6) and 7.4 (2.0) for patients who did not receive, declined, and received analgesia, respectively (p < 0.001). Fentanyl as a single agent, ketamine in combination with fentanyl and ketamine as a single agent were used in 533 (84%), 94 (14%) and 10 (2%) patients, respectively. A high initial on-scene pain score and a presumptive diagnosis of fracture were the main determinants of analgesia administration. Fentanyl was preferred for paediatric patients and ketamine was preferentially administered for severe pain by physicians who had more medical experience or had trained in anaesthesia.

AB  - ABSTRACT A proficiency test specimen was developed for evaluating laboratory precision in paralytic shellfish poisoning bioassays. Such a specimen is needed since much of health and economic consequence depends on an analyst's precision in measuring the toxin. Therefore, after testing clams, mussels, and mashed potato matrices, a test specimen composed of saxitoxin dihydrochloride and hydrated potato flakes was selected. Samples containing two toxin levels were sent to 14 collaborating laboratories. Analysis of results identified errors arising from poor dilution techniques. Recovery percentages and variances of mashed potato were comparable to those previously reported with shellfish matrices. Use of the potato matrix appears to offer cost and convenience advantages.

AB  - Abstract Objective To investigate school performance of childhood cancer survivors focusing on the child's functioning, including peer relationships, school attendance, and academic achievement. Methods We studied 241 children from 15 institutions in Korea between 2015 and 2016. The self-reported paper-and-pencil questionnaires were used. Results Approximately 22% of the survivors suffered from lack of friends. Bullying was reported by 30% of survivors. Survivors who returned to primary school reported a higher incidence of bullying compared with survivors who returned to middle or high school (P = 0.03). The percentage of children who missed classes more than 4 days in a month was higher in survivors with brain tumors than those with other tumors (P = 0.04). Approximately 41% of children reported learning difficulty. After returning to school, 53% of the patients reported that they had lower overall mark averages than they had before. Patients who returned to high school showed the highest rate of repeating a grade and the lowest rate of achieving high academic marks. The school marks in the Korean (P = 0.03), English (P = 0.04), and physical education (P = 0.04) were worse for the children with brain tumors than for the children with other tumors. Conclusion We found that 20% to 25% of survivors experienced peer-related difficulties upon returning to school. Patients who return to school, especially high school, should be provided more educational support to overcome low academic achievement. Particular concern is needed to the patients with brain tumors, who are at risk for significant academic and social difficulties and therefore may require more intensive support in school.

AB  - Abstract Objectives/Hypothesis To describe the acoustic characteristics of voice in individuals with motor speech disorders after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Study Design Prospective study of 100 individuals with TBI based on consecutive referrals for motor speech evaluations. Methods Subjects were audio tape-recorded while producing sustained vowels and single word and sentence intelligibility tests. Laryngeal airway resistance was estimated, and voice quality was rated perceptually. Results None of the subjects evidenced vocal parameters within normal limits. The most frequently occurring abnormal parameter across subjects was amplitude perturbation, followed by voice turbulence index. Twenty-three percent of subjects evidenced deviation in all five parameters measured. The perceptual ratings of breathiness were significantly correlated with both the amplitude perturbation quotient and the noise-to-harmonics ratio. Conclusions Vocal quality deviation is common in motor speech disorders after TBI and may impact intelligibility.
