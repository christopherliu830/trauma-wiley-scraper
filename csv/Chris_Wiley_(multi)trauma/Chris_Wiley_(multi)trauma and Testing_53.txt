AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has become an important area for social work practice. Children and adults sustaining TBI often undergo hospitalisation, rehabilitation and face the prospect of lifelong cognitive and psychosocial impairments. Families are profoundly affected by the consequences of the injury. TBI is a ?hidden disability? because there are typically no physical markers indicating a person has brain damage. This paper aims to provide some guidelines for social work practice in the area, in particular, outlining options for social work interventions at individual, family, community, service system and policy levels. Social workers need to acquire specialised knowledge about brain injury, reformulate traditional models of grief counselling to address the adjustment challenges and utilise community education and service innovation to address the social stigma and reduced level of community participation associated with brain damage. Finally, social workers aim to nurture a sense of hope in the face of the tragedy.

AB  - Abstract This article examines later fidelity and implementation of a five-site pan-Canadian Housing First research demonstration project. The average fidelity score across five Housing First domains and 10 programs was high in the first year of operation (3.47/4) and higher in the third year of operation (3.62/4). Qualitative interviews (36 key informant interviews and 17 focus groups) revealed that staff expertise, partnerships with other services, and leadership facilitated implementation, while staff turnover, rehousing participants, participant isolation, and limited vocational/educational supports impeded implementation. The findings shed light on important implementation ?drivers? at the staff, program, and community levels.

AB  - Objectives:? Study patch test reactivity to nickel sulphate and fragrance mix in a population of unselected infants with focus on reproducibility, clinical relevance, and nickel patch test concentration. Method:? The data presented is part of a clinical epidemiological study of allergic diseases in newborns followed prospectively with questionnaire, clinical examination and testing at 0, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months of age. TRUE Test patches were used with nickel sulphate in 3 concentrations: 200, 66, 22?ìg/cm2 and fragrance mix 430?ìg/cm2. A positive reaction suggesting sensitisation was defined as at least palpable erythema present at both the 12 and 18 months follow-up visits. Results:? A total of 543 children (268 girls, 275 boys) were patch tested at least once, 304 children were tested at both 12 and 18 months. The prevalence of a reproducible positive reaction to nickel sulphate 200?ìg/cm2 was 8.6%(20 girls, 6 boys). A transient reactivity was observed in 111 children (53 girls, 58 boys). A clinical relevance to nickel was found in only one child. There was no association between number of patch test procedures performed and reactions to nickel sulphate. Reproducible reactivity to fragrance mix was not found. Conclusion:? A high proportion of transient patch test reactivity to nickel sulphate 200?ìg/cm2 was found. Patch testing with nickel in concentrations used for adults cannot be recommended in infants. The interpretation of a singular positive nickel patch test in small children must be assessed with caution. Allergic reactions to fragrance mix were not found in this age group.

AB  - Accessible summary What is known on the subject? Since the promulgation of the one-child policy in 1979, most families have had only one child. Shidu parents, as a special group of Sichuan 2008 earthquake victims, are parents who lost their only child in the earthquake. What does this paper added to existing knowledge? Shidu parents are an especially vulnerable group in China. This study was the first systematic population-based investigation to explore quality of life (QOL) risk factors and to examine the moderating role of social support between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and QOL in Shidu parents. What are the implications for practice? The results found that further social support should be provided as a long-term mental health intervention strategy to promote QOL in Shidu parents suffering from PTSD. The research may provide information to assist psychologists in post-disaster mental health interventions with Shidu parents and to inspire decision makers who work with similar groups in other countries. Abstract Introduction Because of the one-child policy in force in China from 1979 to 2015, most parents were only allowed to have a single child. Of all the Sichuan earthquake victims, there was a special group called the Shidu parents who lost their only child in the earthquake. Aim The aim of this study was to identify the related risk factors for the Shidu parents' quality of life (QOL) and to examine the role of social support as a moderator between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and QOL in Shidu parents. Method A cross-sectional sample survey was conducted to collect data from 10 heavily damaged counties in Sichuan province (n = 176). Discussion PTSD was found to be negatively associated with the Shidu parents' QOL, and social support had a major effect on moderating the association between the PTSD and QOL in Shidu parents. Implications for practice Developing suitable social support could be considered a key part of psychological intervention strategies to promote QOL in Shidu parents suffering from PTSD. This study could provide decision support for mental health professionals (e.g. nurses and psychiatrists) working on mental crisis interventions with Shidu parents.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Skeletal age estimation is an integral part of the biological profile. Recent work shows how multiple-trait approaches better capture senescence as it occurs at different rates among individuals. Furthermore, a Bayesian statistical framework of analysis provides more useful age estimates. The component-scoring method of Transition Analysis (TA) may resolve many of the functional and statistical limitations of traditional phase-aging methods and is applicable to both paleodemography and forensic casework. The present study contributes to TA-research by validating TA for multiple, differently experienced observers using a collection of modern forensic skeletal cases. Materials and methods Five researchers independently applied TA to a random sample of 58 documented individuals from the William M. Bass Forensic Skeletal Collection, for whom knowledge of chronological age was withheld. Resulting scores were input into the ADBOU software and maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were produced using the forensic prior. Krippendorff's alpha was used to evaluate interrater reliability and agreement. Inaccuracy and bias were measured to gauge the magnitude and direction of difference between estimated ages and chronological ages among the five observers. Results The majority of traits had moderate to excellent agreement among observers (≥0.6). The superior surface morphology had the least congruence (0.4), while the ventral symphyseal margin had the most (0.9) among scores. Inaccuracy was the lowest for individuals younger than 30 and the greatest for individuals over 60. Consistent over-estimation of individuals younger than 30 and under-estimation of individuals over 40 years old occurred. Individuals in their 30s showed a mixed pattern of under- and over-estimation among observers. Discussion These results support the use of the TA method by researchers of varying experience levels. Further, they validate its use on forensic cases, given the low error overall.

AB  - The International Working Group on Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggested the free and cued selective reminding test (FCSRT) to assess memory, as it showed high sensitivity and specificity in the differentiation of AD from healthy controls and other dementias. The FCSRT involves the use of selective reminding with semantic cueing in memory assessment. This study aims to validate the FCSRT for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD through the analysis of the diagnostic accuracy and the suggestion of cut-off scores. Patients were classified into two groups according to standard criteria: MCI (n = 100) and AD (n = 70). A matched control group (n = 101) of cognitively healthy subjects was included. The reliability and the validity of the FCSRT were analysed on the immediate (IR) and delayed (DR) recalls. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.915 for the IR and 0.879 for the DR. The total recall measures revealed good areas under the curve for MCI (IR: .818; DR: .828) and excellent for AD (IR: .987; DR: .991). Furthermore, the MCI group was subdivided with respect to a non-similar/similar AD pattern of impairment, with almost half of the subjects showing an AD-like decline. This analysis represents a novel contribution regarding the properties of the FCSRT in illustrating the heterogeneity of MCI at baseline. The FCSRT has proved to be a very useful tool in the characterization of the memory impairment of the AD spectrum.

AB  - Introduction Biochemical and hemogasometric parameters have been used to evaluate equine performance. This study evaluated blood biochemical and hemogasometry variables of horses during incremental jumping and speed tests. Methods Eighteen horses performed a jumping test with four steps over a vertical obstacle of 1.10?m height (10, 15, 20 and 25 jumps, respectively) totaling 70 jumps, and a speed test with six steps of one minute each with increasing speed from 2 to 8?m/s. Blood samples were collected before and immediately after each test to determine plasma lactate, hematocrit, total plasma protein, glucose, uric acid and hemogasometry variables. Results were analysed by ANOVA and compared by 5% Tukey test. Results Immediately after tests the hematocrit and total plasma protein decreased from 52.4% to 38.9%, and from 7.2 to 6.7?g/dl respectively, and the glucose increased from 98.3 to 109.8?mg/dl (P<0.05). The lactate and uric acid concentrations were higher with speed testing (7.97?±?4.8?mmol/l and 1.33?±?0.8?mg/dl respectively) than jumping testing (3.92?±?3.0?mmol/l and 1.24?±?0.9?mg/dl respectively). The blood pH was lower after speed testing (7.36?±?0.1) than the jumping test (7.40?±?0.04) (P<0.05). Blood pCO2, Na and K concentrations increased more after the speed test (53.38?±?7.3?mmHg/l; 139?±?3.0?mEq/l; 4.7?±?0.8?mEq/l respectively) than after the jumping test (49.34?±?3.2?mmHg/l; 138.3?±?2.3?mEq/l; 4.51?±?0.6?mEq/l respectively) (P<0.05). Blood pO2 was not different among tests (P>0.05). Conclusions Incremental jumping and velocity tests are useful tools for assessing performance of jumping horses. Differences among tests could evidence a smaller anaerobic contribution during jumping test.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to describe the response in heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, hematocrit and plasma lactate concentration in Icelandic horses performing the riding assessment in an official breed evaluation field test (BEFT) in Iceland (April 2011). It was hypothesized that the riding assessment constituted high intensity exercise. Methods Data was collected from 15 of 28 horses shown at the BEFT. Horses were judged for riding abilities (all gaits) on a straight track. Respiratory rate and rectal temperature were recorded and blood samples were taken from the jugular vein before the warm-up and within 5?min after the riding assessment. Hematocrit was analysed by centrifugation of capillary tubes and plasma lactate concentration using an enzymatic and spectrophotometric method. Velocity, distance and heart rate were recorded (Polar, Kempele, Finland) during the riding assessment. Anova (Proc GLM) was performed in SAS and data is presented as LSMean ±?SE (P<0.05). Results The distance covered was 2.7?±?0.1?km, the duration 9:13?±?0:21?min?:?sec and the average speed 17.5?±?0.3?km/h. The peak heart rate was 214?±?3?bpm. Post-exercise plasma lactate concentration was 18.6?±?1.7?mmol/L and there was an increase (P<0.001) in respiratory rate (40?±?6 to 118?±?6 breaths/min), rectal temperature (38.1?±?0.1 to 39.8?±?0.1°C) and hematocrit (35?±?2 to 47?±?2%) following the breed evaluation field test. Conclusions The physiological responses indicate that the riding assessment in BEFT is a demanding exercise, requiring some contribution of anaerobic metabolism. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the National Animal Research Committee of Iceland. Owners and trainers were informed that participation was voluntary.

AB  - Introduction There is little information about biochemical and physiologic responses to exercise in Brazilian gaited horses. The aim of this study was to evaluate blood biomarkers and heart rate (HR) in gaited horses during a standardized gaited field test (SGT). Methods Sixteen horses performed a SGT (10?min warm-up, 30?min of marcha gait and 15?min recovery). Blood samples and HR were collected at rest, after warm-up, after 15 (F?+?15) and 30?min (F?+?30) of marcha, and after recovery. Assays were performed to measure glucose, lactate, total plasma protein, hematocrit, urea, creatinine, glutamine, glutamate, triglycerides, total cholesterol, Ca, P, Mg, Na, Cl and K. HR was measured using a HR monitor. Results were analyzed using one-way or two-way ANOVA. Post-hoc analyses included the Holm-Sidak test, Student's t-tests, and Pearson's correlation analyses. The null hypothesis was rejected when P<0.05. Results [Glucose] and [lactate] increased during SGT (P<0.05). A significant interaction between phase of SGT and fitness level was observed for [glucose] but not for [lactate]. The SGT also produced increases (P<0.05) in hematocrit, [TPP], [urea], [creatinine], [triglycerides], [P] and [K] and a reduction (P<0.05) in [Ca]. HR increased from ?47?bpm at rest, to ?140?bpm at F?+?15 and F?+?30 (P<0.05). Conclusions This study documents submaximal aerobic exercise, as performed during the GST is sufficient to alter energy biomarkers in gaited horses.

AB  - In traumatised non-vital immature permanent incisors, clinicians are challenged by thin root dentine walls and a wide-open apex. Apexification involves using a temporary paste to stimulate the formation of calcified tissue at the apex; while apical plug techniques involve packing of a material into the apical 2?4?mm of an immature canal to act as a barrier against which gutta-percha is condensed. The risk of root fracture during apexification in immature roots is a concern. This complication has lead researchers to explore ways of root strengthening in addition to inducing a barrier. Objectives:? To assess the effectiveness of methods for inducing an apical barrier or root strengthening and immediate & long-term side effects of these interventions. Design:? Cochrane Systematic Review of randomised controlled trials. Methods:? Electronic and manual search using controlled vocabulary and free text terms with no language restrictions. The methodological quality of each study is assessed using the criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Primary results:? Multi-database electronic search via OVID revealed 117 total hits. Conclusions:? Primary analysis of reports yielded 10 studies initially fulfilled inclusion criteria, five retrospective studies, 18 in vitro studies, six animal studies, 53 case reports & review articles and 25 not applicable reports.

AB  - ABSTRACT Joint injury causes post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). About ?50% of patients rupturing their anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) will develop PTOA within 1?2 decades of the injury, yet the mechanisms responsible for the development of PTOA after joint injury are not well understood. In this study, we examined whole joint gene expression by RNA sequencing (RNAseq) at 1 day, 1-, 6-, and 12 weeks post injury, in a non-invasive tibial compression (TC) overload mouse model of PTOA that mimics ACL rupture in humans. We identified 1446 genes differentially regulated between injured and contralateral joints. This includes known regulators of osteoarthritis such as MMP3, FN1, and COMP, and several new genes including Suco, Sorcs2, and Medag. We also identified 18 long noncoding RNAs that are differentially expressed in the injured joints. By comparing our data to gene expression data generated using the surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) PTOA model, we identified several common genes and shared mechanisms. Our study highlights several differences between these two models and suggests that the TC model may be a more rapidly progressing model of PTOA. This study provides the first account of gene expression changes associated with PTOA development and progression in a TC model. ? 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Abstract Symptom checklists and a follow-up questionnaire were mailed to the first 180 graduates of an inpatient Post Traumatic Stress Treatment program. Eighty-six of the 180 responded to the survey. Their responses were compared to measures obtained on them while they were inpatients at the treatment program. Significant differences were found on one symptom checklist, while positive trends toward symptom reduction were noted on another. Demographic characteristics of the respondents were dicusssed, as were responses to open-ended questions regarding in what ways the program helped most and least. Changes in a positive direction were noted in the area of self-esteem, interpersonal relationships, and symptoms of numbing and arousal. PTSD-related intrusive symptoms had the least clear-cut improvement. Implications of these findings for inpatient treatment and aftercare are reviewed, with suggestions for future applied research.

AB  - Abstract The present study aimed to test whether monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene polymorphism was a marker of the genetic vulnerability model or the differential susceptibility model by investigating the interaction of MAOA gene polymorphism with maternal parenting on externalizing and internalizing problems and social competence among Chinese children. Participants were 290 children and their parents in China. MAOA genotypes were ascertained by polymerase chain reaction amplification. Mothers reported their parenting stress and engagement in parent?child activities when the child was 6 months old. Children's behavioral problems and social competence were rated by mothers and fathers at 48 months old. The results showed that MAOA genotypes interacted with maternal parenting stress in predicting boys' internalizing problems. Also, MAOA genotypes interacted with maternal engagement in parent?child activities in predicting boys' social competence. The analyses of regions of significance and the proportion of interaction index indicated that boys with the low-activity genotype were at risk for (a) high internalizing problems under high maternal parenting stress and (b) low social competence if mothers displayed a low level of maternal engagement. No significant interaction effects were found among girls. The results suggested that the MAOA gene might be a marker of the genetic vulnerability model among Chinese boys. Highlights We evaluated whether MAOA gene was a marker of the genetic vulnerability model or the differential susceptibility model by investigating the interaction of MAOA gene polymorphism with maternal parenting on behavioral problems and social competence among 4-year-old Chinese children. The results of regions of significance and the proportion of interaction index indicated that boys with the low-activity genotype were at risk of high internalizing problems or low social competence with high maternal parenting stress or low engagement. No significant interaction effects were found among girls. The results indicated that MAOA gene might be a marker of the genetic vulnerability model rather than the differential susceptibility model.

AB  - Abstract Patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) suffer from a failure of cognitive control over emotional distracters. The physiological substrates of cognitive-emotional interactions and their breakdown in disease are, however, unknown. Here, we studied brain activity in PTSD patients and healthy controls in response to emotion-provoking pictures using electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We demonstrate that in healthy individuals, emotion-induced frontal theta rhythm modulates activity in the beta rhythm mainly in sensory-motor regions. In contrast, in PTSD patients, beta activity is elevated irrespective of emotion, and is not modulated by frontal theta activity in response to negative emotion. EEG source localization and fMRI findings suggest that theta activity is localized to the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices while beta activity is localized to sensory-motor regions. We further found that beta activity in sensory-motor regions is related to the emotion-induced slowing of the motor response in healthy controls while the excess frontal theta activity in PTSD is related to the intensity of negative emotional experience. These findings reveal for the first time the importance of brain electrical oscillations and coherence in emotional top-down modulation and point to specific failure of these mechanisms in PTSD.

AB  - Abstract There is growing evidence of the brain's ability to increase its reliance on alternative metabolic substrates under conditions of energy stress such as starvation, hypoxia and ischemia. We hypothesized that following traumatic brain injury (TBI), which results in immediate changes in energy metabolism, the adult brain increases uptake and oxidation of the alternative substrate ?-hydroxybutyrate (?HB). Arterio-venous differences were used to determine global cerebral uptake of ?HB and production of 14CO2 from [14C]3-?HB 3?h after controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury. Quantitative bioluminescence was used to assess regional changes in ATP concentration. As expected, adult sham and CCI animals with only endogenously available ?HB showed no significant increase in cerebral uptake of ?HB or 14CO2 production. Increasing arterial ?HB concentrations 2.9-fold with 3?h of ?HB infusion failed to increase cerebral uptake of ?HB or 14CO2 production in adult sham animals. Only CCI animals that received a 3-h ?HB infusion showed an 8.5-fold increase in cerebral uptake of ?HB and greater than 10.7-fold increase in 14CO2 production relative to sham ?HB-infused animals. The TBI-induced 20% decrease in ipsilateral cortical ATP concentration was alleviated by 3?h of ?HB infusion beginning immediately after CCI injury.

AB  - Abstract Objective Soft tissue (ST) dehiscence with graft exposure is a frequent complication of vertical augmentation. Flap dehiscence is caused by failure to achieve tension-free primary wound closure and by the impairment of flap microcirculation due to surgical trauma. Soft tissue expansion (STE) increases ST quality and quantity prior to reconstructive surgery. We hypothesized that flap preconditioning using STE would reduce the incidence of ST complications after bone augmentation and that optimized ST healing would improve the outcome of bone regeneration. Materials and methods Self-filling tissue expanders were implanted in mandibular bone defects in ten beagle dogs. After expansion, alloplastic scaffolds were placed for vertical bone augmentation in STE sites and in control sites without STE pre-treatment. ST flap microcirculation was analysed using laser Doppler flowmetry. The incidence of graft exposures was evaluated after 2 weeks. Bone formation was assessed after 2 months, using histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry. Results Test sites showed significantly less impairment of perfusion and faster recovery of microcirculation after bone augmentation. Furthermore, no flap dehiscences occurred in STE sites. Bone regeneration was found in both groups; however, significantly greater formation of new bone was detected in test sites with preceding STE. Conclusions Preconditioning using STE improved ST healing and bone formation after vertical augmentation. The combination of STE and the subsequent placement of alloplastic scaffolds may facilitate the reconstruction of severe bone defects.

AB  - Abstract This study tests a model that uses organizational justice variables and the personality trait of negative affectivity to explain two forms of deviant employee behavior. Prior research suggests that deviance can be directed interpersonally or against organizations. We propose a model that links unfavorable perceptions of distributive, procedural, and interactional justice, as well as the dispositional trait of negative affectivity, to both types of deviant acts. To test the model, a survey was distributed to employees from a government agency and an international manufacturer of paper products. Responses to the survey were analysed using structural equation modeling to evaluate the fit of the theoretical model to the data. Results showed that the model fits the data well and that nearly all of the hypothesized relations among constructs were supported. Implications of the results for the prediction and control of deviant behavior are discussed and future research directions are offered. Copyright ? 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
