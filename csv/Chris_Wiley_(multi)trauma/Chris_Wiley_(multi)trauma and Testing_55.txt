AB  - Abstract Purpose: To use a new approach which provides, based on the widely used three-dimensional double-echo steady-state (DESS) sequence, in addition to the morphological information, the generation of biochemical T2 maps in one hybrid sequence. Materials and Methods: In 50 consecutive MRIs at 3.0 Tesla (T) after matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte transplantation (MACT) of the knee, by the use this new DESS-T2d approach, the morphological Magnetic resonance Observation of CArtilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score, as well as biochemical T2d values were assessed. Furthermore, these results were correlated to standard morphological sequences as well as to standard multi-echo spin-echo T2 mapping. Results: The MOCART score correlated (Pearson:0.945; P < 0.001) significantly as assessed with standard morphological sequences (68.8 ± 13.2) and the morphological images of the DESS T2d sequence (68.7 ± 12.6). T2 and T2d relaxation times (ms) were comparable in between the control cartilage (T2: 52.5 ± 11.4; T2d: 46.6 ± 10.3) and the repair tissue (T2: 54.4 ± 11.4; T2d: 47.5 ± 13.0) (T2: P = 0.157; T2d: P = 0.589). As expected, T2d values were lower than the standard-T2 values, however, both functional relaxation times correlated significantly (Pearson:0.429; P < 0.001). Conclusion: The presented hybrid approach provides the possibility to combine morphological and biochemical MRI in one fast 3D sequence, and thus, may attract for the clinical use of biochemical MRI.

AB  - During its nine years of existence, AmeriCorps has had a tremendous impact on its volunteers and the communities it serves. Despite concerns expressed by the Republican congressional leadership, the Corporation for National and Community Service?the federally funded administrative organization that directs AmeriCorps programs at the national level?has made clear its intention to operate in a nonpartisan, politically neutral manner. A study of AmeriCorps programs in four western states finds the corporation is accomplishing its ?neutrality? objective and is rebuilding a sense of civic?mindedness in a manner that lacks gender or racial bias?a critical element in reestablishing a strong choral society?all the while properly respecting diversity.

AB  - Aim? Since 1995, the SCBB has used three protocols to screen CB for contaminating microbes. The protocols differed in the number of culture bottles inoculated and sample volume used. The aim of this study was to compare microbial detection rates for each method. Method? CB units (n?=?9,618) were tested for microbial contamination using BacT/ALERT blood culture bottles (BioMerieux). Of these, 6,836 had 20?ml plasma waste fraction inoculated into adult anaerobic and aerobic bottles (Group A), 365 had 1?ml final stem cell product into an aerobic paediatric bottle (Group B), and 2,417 had 1?ml final product into a paediatric bottle and 10?ml plasma waste fraction into an adult anaerobic bottle (Group C). All bottles were incubated for a minimum of 5?days. Detection rates for microbe contamination were calculated for each group. Result? Microbe detection rates were: Group A ?345/6836 (5.0%), Group B ? 3/365 (0.8%) and Group C ? 66/2417 (2.7%)(p?<?0.0001). Organisms detected by A but not by B (and to a lesser extent C) included Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Bacteroides and Proprionibacterium. Conclusion? Contamination detection rates differ significantly, depending upon the sample volume and type of culture bottle used. A protocol that uses the recommended sample volume and both anaerobic and anaerobic test bottles is likely to detect the highest number of contaminated units. Testing of a small sample from the final product using only a single paediatric aerobic bottle is likely to miss detection of the majority of anaerobic and some aerobic organisms. Prospective studies to define a standardised method for microbial detection for CB are required.

AB  - Introduction In an official breed evaluation field test (BEFT) for Icelandic horses, gaits are scored from 5?10 and there is an option for judges to add standardized comments on the gaits. The aim of this study was to test if comments given on pace were related to horses? plasma lactate concentration (Lac) post BEFT, with the hypothesis that some of the comments would be related to Lac. Methods Data was collected from 157 horses (age 4?11 years) at a BEFT in Iceland in 2011. Venous blood samples were obtained after exercise and lactate concentration determined. Judges? comments were obtained from Worldfengur. The comments that could be given were: ?good speed?, ?clear beat?, ?sure?, ?big movements?, ?good suspension?, ?long strides? (positive comments); and ?lack of speed?, ?unsure?, ?four-beat?, ?short strides?, ?changing gait? and ?jumping out of gait? (negative comments). Results were separated into two groups (within each comment); horses/pace with the comment and horses/pace without the comment. Data were analysed via ANOVA (Proc GLM, SAS) including sex, age group, comment, average speed and distance (P<0.05). Results Lac was higher when pace had comments ?good speed? and ?sure? than when no comment was given (23.6?±?1.2 vs. 17.9?±?0.5, P<0.001; and 20.2?±?0.9 vs. 18.1?±?0.6, P<0.05) and was lower when pace had comments ?lack of speed? and ?unsure? (16.8?±?1.0 vs. 19.2?±?0.6; and 16.2?±?1.0 vs. 19.3?±?0.5, P<0.05). No other significant effects on Lac were observed. Conclusions Horses with pace subjectively judged as fast and ?sure? had higher blood lactate concentration indicating that successful pace is more anaerobic than less successful pace. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the National Animal Research Committee of Iceland. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study is not stated. Sources of funding:?Developmental Fund of the Icelandic Horse Breeding, the Pálmi Jónsson Natural Conservation Fund and the Stock Protection Fund of the Icelandic Horse breed. Competing interests:?none.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively useful sonographic diagnostic criteria for testicular rupture in patients with blunt scrotal trauma and to determine significant predictors among the criteria. Methods From July 2004 to February 2007, 29 consecutive patients (mean age, 22.8 years; range, 20?43 years) with blunt scrotal trauma who underwent scrotal sonography were enrolled. Ten ruptured testes and 6 intact testes were confirmed by surgery, and an additional 13 intact testes were confirmed by a physical examination. The sonographic findings were recorded with respect to contour irregularity, the presence of intratesticular and extratesticular heterogeneous echoes, loss of blood flow on color Doppler sonography, and engorgement of the pampiniform plexus by consensus between 2 radiologists. The sonographic findings used to diagnose testicular rupture were analyzed by the Fisher exact test, and significant predictors were determined by multiple regression analysis. Results The ruptured testes showed contour irregularity (P = .0002), a heterogeneous intratesticular echo pattern (P = .0077), and loss of blood flow on color Doppler sonography (P = .0093). Engorgement of the pampiniform plexus was seen in most nonruptured testes (P = .0178). Contour irregularity was the only significant predictor for the diagnosis of testicular rupture (P = .0002). On the basis of this single predictor, diagnostic predictive values for sonography were calculated; the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were all 90%. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 82% and 94%, respectively. Conclusions Among the useful sonographic criteria, contour irregularity is the only significant predictor for the diagnosis of testicular rupture in patients with blunt scrotal trauma.

AB  - Summary? Putty form graft materials may have additional favourable effects when compared with particulate ones in periodontal bone defects. The purpose of this study was to assess clinical and also radiographic changes following application of (i) putty form demineralized bone matrix (DBM), (ii) particulate form DBM and (iii) open flap debridement (control), using modified curtain suturing technique in the treatment of interproximal suprabony (horizontal) defects. Twenty-five chronic periodontitis patients with 125 sites (radiologically ≥4?mm horizontal bone defect) were selected to participate in this triple-blind, split mouth, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Putty and particulate form DBM grafts were placed at experimental sites. Clinical measurements included probing depth (PD), relative attachment level (RAL), gingival recession and bone probing depth (BPD) were made at baseline and repeated 12?months after the operations. Standardized digital radiographs were also taken to measure radiographic bone level (RBL) at baseline and 12?months later to be compared in a software. Probing depth reductions and RAL gains were significantly improved in all treatment groups (P?<?0·001). No significant differences in soft tissue parameters were found among three groups (P?>?0·05). Bone probing depth measurements indicated comparable significant bone gain in graft applied groups (P?<?0·01) and a significant bone resorption in open flap debridement group (P?<?0·01). Radiographic evaluation did not show any significant bone gain or resorption in all treatment groups (P?>?0·05). The results of this study indicate that either putty or particulate DBM demonstrates similar enhancements in soft and hard tissue parameters. Applying putty or particulate form DBM results with slight bone formation when compared with open flap debridement in horizontal bone defects at 1-year post-operative examination according to BPD measurements.

AB  - ABSTRACT Patients with tibial pilon fractures have a higher incidence of post-traumatic osteoarthritis than those with fractures of the tibial plateau. This may indicate that pilon fractures present a greater mechanical insult to the joint than do plateau fractures. We tested the hypothesis that fracture energy and articular fracture edge length, two independent indicators of severity, are higher in pilon than plateau fractures. We also evaluated whether clinical fracture classification systems accurately reflect severity. Seventy-five tibial plateau fractures and 52 tibial pilon fractures from a multi-institutional study were selected to span the spectrum of severity. Fracture severity measures were calculated using objective CT-based image analysis methods. The ranges of fracture energies measured for tibial plateau and pilon fractures were 3.2?33.2?Joules (J) and 3.6?32.2?J, respectively, and articular fracture edge lengths were 68.0?493.0?mm and 56.1?288.6?mm, respectively. There were no differences in the fracture energies between the two fracture types, but plateau fractures had greater articular fracture edge lengths (p?<?0.001). The clinical fracture classifications generally reflected severity, but there was substantial overlap of fracture severity measures between different classes. Similar fracture energies with different degrees of articular surface involvement suggest a possible explanation for dissimilar rates of post-traumatic osteoarthritis for fractures of the tibial plateau compared to the tibial pilon. The substantial overlap of severity measures between different fracture classes may well have confounded prior clinical studies relying on fracture classification as a surrogate for severity. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - The cognitive and behavioral deficits caused by traumatic brain injury (TBI) to the immature brain are more severe and persistent than injuries to the adult brain. Understanding this developmental sensitivity is critical because children under 4 years of age of sustain TBI more frequently than any other age group. One of the first events after TBI is the infiltration and degranulation of mast cells (MCs) in the brain, releasing a range of immunomodulatory substances; inhibition of these cells is neuroprotective in other types of neonatal brain injury. This study investigates for the first time the role of MCs in mediating injury in a P7 mouse model of pediatric contusion-induced TBI. We show that various neural cell types express histamine receptors and that histamine exacerbates excitotoxic cell death in primary cultured neurons. Cromoglycate, an inhibitor of MC degranulation, altered the inflammatory phenotype of microglia activated by TBI, reversing several changes but accentuating others, when administered before TBI. However, without regard to the time of cromoglycate administration, inhibiting MC degranulation did not affect cell loss, as evaluated by ventricular dilatation or cleaved caspase-3 labeling, or the density of activated microglia, neurons, or myelin. In double-heterozygous cKit mutant mice lacking MCs, this overall lack of effect was confirmed. These results suggest that the role of MCs in this model of pediatric TBI is restricted to subtle effects and that they are unlikely to be viable neurotherapeutic targets. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background Hospital readmissions due to illness among geriatric patients result in human suffering and psychological trauma. Resilience in chronic illness protects geriatric patients from outcomes of trauma leads to psychological and physical well-being and enables bouncing back to life. While communication has been linked to improved health outcomes, little is known about communication pathways in the context of postdischarge resilience. Aim and objective To explore the role of communication pathways that acute-care clinicians used with geriatric patients in postdischarge resilience. Methodological design and justification Participants were ten geriatric patients who were readmitted several times in the past year. Twenty narrative interviews were conducted, one upon discharge and the other a month thereafter. Data for each phase of interviews were analysed using methods of selection mechanisms and Bricolage. Ethical issues The ethics committee approved the study. Participants signed an informed-consent form for participation and publication. Findings Communication in acute care that enhanced health literacy, perceived control and reflection, contributed to higher comprehensibility and manageability during the hospitalisation and postdischarge meaningfulness postdischarge, contributing resilience. Participants who experienced other forms of communication demonstrated anxiety and helplessness with lingering psychological trauma postdischarge. Conclusions Acute care may provide clinicians with opportunities to alleviate the suffering of geriatric patients and contribute to their postdischarge resilience. The suggested T.E.R model delineates communication pathways to fuel the trajectory from psychological trauma to postdischarge resilience in practice.

AB  - Abstract This paper compares diagnoses of the DSM-IV algorithms of the computer-assisted version of the Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview (M-CIDI) with clinical diagnoses made by treating physicians using the standard LEAD procedure. A random sample of 68 patients being treated in three psychiatric and one neurological ward of the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry were first examined with the CIDI, using the M-CIDI/DSM-IV algorithms. Diagnostic findings were then compared with lifetime and cross-sectional diagnoses assigned by the treating physician, who was blind to the CIDI findings, taking into account all available symptom and diagnostic information from current and previous charts as well as his own assessments. Clinicians were encouraged to use the DSM-IV manual to assign multiple lifetime diagnoses and not to focus exclusively on primary diagnoses. To explore agreements and disagreements further, all discrepant cases were subsequently discussed with the treating physicians. There was generally good concordance between clinicians and interview DSM-IV diagnoses, with the exception of psychotic disorders (kappa: 0.21), dysthymia (0.54) and somatoform disorders (0.50), with kappa values for the remaining categories ranging from 0.63 (any panic disorder) to 0.96 (any depressive episode). It is concluded that the M-CIDI, in clinical cases, provides valid diagnoses for almost all non-psychotic disorders and is sensitive for all disorders but might have reduced specificity and predictive value in some anxiety and somatoform disorders.

We analyzed the conduction values in these hand nerves in healthy volunteers to find any physiological differences between them. Methods: We performed standard conduction studies and conduction velocity distribution (CVD) tests with estimation of 3 quartiles in 31 healthy right-handed volunteers (17 women, 14 men) with a mean age of 44.8?±?15.5?years. Results: The conduction velocities in all quartiles of CVD tests were statistically faster in the ulnar nerve (P?<?0.00001), with no differences in the spread of conduction values and no differences between sides. In the ulnar nerve, CVD velocities in all quartiles were faster in the female group (P?<?0.05). Discussion: The ulnar nerve has more fibers conducting with high velocities than does the median nerve. Electrophysiological comparisons between hand nerves must be performed carefully. Muscle Nerve 59:470?474, 2019

AB  - (Headache 2010;50:1262-1272) Objectives.? To determine the prevalence, characteristics, impact, and treatment patterns of headaches after concussion in US Army soldiers returning from a deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan. Methods.? A cross-sectional study was conducted with a cohort of soldiers undergoing postdeployment evaluation during a 5-month period at the Madigan Traumatic Brain Injury Program at Ft. Lewis, WA. All soldiers screening positive for a deployment-related concussion were given a 13-item headache questionnaire. Results.? A total of 1033 (19.6%) of 5270 returning soldiers met criteria for a deployment-related concussion. Among those with a concussion, 957 (97.8%) reported having headaches during the final 3 months of deployment. Posttraumatic headaches, defined as headaches beginning within 1 week after a concussion, were present in 361 (37%) soldiers. In total, 58% of posttraumatic headaches were classified as migraine. Posttraumatic headaches had a higher attack frequency than nontraumatic headaches, averaging 10 days per month. Chronic daily headache was present in 27% of soldiers with posttraumatic headache compared with 14% of soldiers with nontraumatic headache. Posttraumatic headaches interfered with duty performance in 37% of cases and caused more sick call visits compared with nontraumatic headache. In total, 78% of soldiers with posttraumatic headache used abortive medications, predominantly over-the-counter analgesics, and most perceived medication as effective. Conclusions.? More than 1 in 3 returning military troops who have sustained a deployment-related concussion have headaches that meet criteria for posttraumatic headache. Migraine is the predominant headache phenotype precipitated by a concussion during military deployment. Compared with headaches not directly attributable to head trauma, posttraumatic headaches are associated with a higher frequency of headache attacks and an increased prevalence of chronic daily headache.

AB  - Voting is the foundation of democracy. Limited data exist about voting characteristics of individuals with neurologic impairment including those living with a traumatic brain injury (TBI). To statistically examine voting characteristics using a convenience sample of registered voters with TBI during elections held in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina?2007, 2008. Data were collected on 51 participants with TBI during May 2007, 2008 general, and 2008 Presidential Election. (i) There was a significant difference between the Competence Assessment Tool for Voting (CAT-V) total score of participants with TBI who voted and the CAT-V total score of participants with TBI who did not vote and the CAT-V total score predicted voting; (ii) the age of the participants with TBI was predictive of voting; and (iii) being married was inversely related to voting. We find that there is variation in voting even among this small sample interviewed for the present study, and that the variation is predictable. Those with the highest CAT-Vs are most likely to vote. In addition, we find that traditional predictors of voting simply are not predictors among this TBI group, and even one, whether the person is married, has a negative effect on voting.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction Volumetric muscle loss (VML) occurs following significant traumatic injury or surgical removal of skeletal muscle, resulting in nonrecoverable loss of tissue and long-term dysfunction. Perhaps less recognized is that VML injuries inherently disrupt the neuromuscular unit, resulting in fiber denervation and presumptive motor unit rearrangement, expansion, and/or loss. To characterize neural dysfunction we quantified motoneuron axotomy, in efforts to understand how this relates to the temporal coordination of neuromuscular and morphological alterations due to injury. Methods In an established rat tibialis anterior (TA) VML injury model, we examined the motoneuron, skeletal muscle, and maximal isometric torque at 3, 7, 14, and 21 days postinjury. Results Significant axotomy of 57?79% of all TA muscle motoneurons was observed through 21 days postinjury, which was coupled with a 45?90% TA maximal torque deficit. Discussion A ?20% partial ablation of the TA muscle causes disproportionate damage across the motor unit acutely postinjury. Muscle Nerve 57: 799?807, 2018

AB  - A child's adjustment to wartime stress is reliant not only on individual responses and qualities, but very significantly on the availability of support that they may receive from their parent or caregivers and quality of relationships. Strengthening parental support has the potential to be valuable. A pilot two-arm randomised controlled trial investigated the feasibility of delivering and evaluating the ?Caring for Children Through Conflict and Displacement? intervention with caregivers in the West Bank. Feasibility to recruit and train non-specialist staff on-the-ground to screen families for eligibility, collect outcome data, deliver the intervention and to recruit and retain families in the study were examined. Research staff and intervention facilitators were successfully appointed in the field, screened participants and delivered the intervention to 120 caregivers, collecting outcome measures pre-and post-delivery. All families completed the outcome measures, with very little missing data. This indicated that the intervention can be delivered feasibly and evaluated with families in this humanitarian context. Preliminary outcome data showed promise that the intervention may have the potential to both improve family functioning and reduce children's problem behaviour. Implications of family-focused initiatives, particularly within a conflict/post-conflict context for the prevention of several negative health and social outcomes directions, are discussed.

AB  - Objectives Relatively little research has been directed toward the assessment of resilience in the health care context. Given the stressors associated with the provision of health care, the present study describes the development and evaluation of a situational judgement test (SJT) designed to assess resilience in palliative care health care workers. Methods An SJT was developed to measure behaviours associated with resilience in a palliative care context. Next, SJT reliability and validity analyses were assessed in a sample of acute ward, hospice and community palliative care workers (n = 284). Results Findings showed the SJT to have a negative association with self-reported sickness absence and a positive association with well-being and employee attitudes (in terms of turnover intention, organisational commitment and job satisfaction). A series of two-wave longitudinal (hierarchical) regressions showed the SJT was predictive of well-being and employee attitudes at two time-points (4 weeks apart) over and above self-report measures of resilience, education and experience, and the Big Five personality dimensions of Emotional Stability and Openness. Reliability analyses showed the SJT to have acceptable test?retest scores (? = 0.71) and high internal consistency (α = 0.91). Conclusions The study findings suggest that the SJT is a valid assessment of resilience in at-risk workers and can be used in either summative or formative assessment under the right set of conditions. More research is needed to test the hypothesis that the SJT might be used as a formative tool to develop workplace resilience.

AB  - Background:? We examined the prevalence and nature of comorbid post-traumatic stress reactions and depressive symptoms, and the impact of exposure to traumatic events on both types of psychopathology, among Palestinian children during war conflict in the region. Methods:? The 403 children aged 9?15 years, who lived in four refugee camps, were assessed by completing the Gaza Traumatic Events Checklist, the Child Post Traumatic Stress Reaction Index (CPTSD-RI), and the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ). Results:? Children reported experiencing a wide range of traumatic events, both direct experience of violence and through the media. CPTSD-RI and MFQ scores were significantly correlated. Both CPTSD-RI and MFQ scores were independently predicted by the number of experienced traumatic events, and this association remained after adjusting for socioeconomic variables. Exposure to traumatic events strongly predicted MFQ scores while controlling for CPTSD-RI scores. In contrast, the association between traumatic events and CPTSD-RI scores, while controlling for MFQ scores, was weak. The CPTSD-RI items whose frequency was significantly associated with total MFQ scores were: sleep disturbance, somatic complaints, constricted affect, impulse control, and difficulties in concentration. However, not all remaining CPTSD-RI items were significantly associated with exposure to traumatic events, thus raising the possibility that the association between depression and PTSD was due in part to symptom overlap. Conclusions:? Children living in war zones are at high risk of suffering from PTSD and depressive disorders. Exposure to trauma was not found to have a unique association with PTSD. The relationship between PTSD and depressive symptomatology requires further investigation.

AB  - TRUE Test? is the only standardized patch test system for the diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis based on 24 fully stable and reproducible formulations. New standardized patches are in process of development for TRUE Test? Panel 3. The allergens chosen are well-known sensitizers and include preservatives, steroids, metals and others. 14 new patches are included in an Experimental panel which is tested in several European clinics. 11 of the patches contain new allergens while 3 patches consist of improved TRUE Test? formulations with Neomycine sulphate, Fragrance mix and Potassium dichromate. A number of the patches from the Experimental panel will be selected for TRUE Test? Panel 3. The overall purpose with pharmaceutical development of patch test materials for TRUE Test? is to obtain a precise dose, bioavailability and stability in every single patch. The patches have to be chemically stable for at least 2 years at refrigerated temperature. The selected preservatives on the Experimental panel are Methyldibromoglutaronitrile, Germall 115, Germall II and Bronopol. All 4 patches have proven to be difficult to stabilize because of the natural reactivity of the allergenic substances. The steroids chosen are Budesonide, Tixocortol-21-pivalate and Hydrocortisone-17-butyrate. All 3 steroids are stable in TRUE Test? formulations. Other allergens on the Experimental panel are Ammoniated Mercury, Goldsodiumthiosulphate, Parthenolide and Disperse blue 106, where the latter consists of a complex mixture. Chemical stabilization of the patches as well as clinical studies will be presented.

AB  - Summary Aims This study aimed at understanding the neurobiological mechanisms associated with inattention induced by traumatic brain injury (TBI). To eliminate the potential confounding caused by the heterogeneity of TBI, we focused on young adults postsports-related concussion (SRC). Methods Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data were collected from 27 young adults post-SRC and 27 group-matched normal controls (NCs), while performing a visual sustained attention task. Task responsive cortical activation maps and pairwise functional connectivity among six regions of interest were constructed for each subject. Correlations among the brain imaging measures and clinical measures of attention were calculated in each group. Results Compared to the NCs, the SRC group showed significantly increased brain activation in left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and increased functional connectivity between right inferior occipital cortex (IOC) bilateral calcarine gyri (CG). The left MFG activation magnitude was significantly negatively correlated with the hyperactive/impulsive symptom severity measure in the NCs, but not in the patients. The right hemisphere CG-IOC functional connectivity showed a significant positive correlation with the hyperactive/impulsive symptom severity measure in patients, but not in NCs. Conclusion The current data suggest that abnormal left MFG activation and hyper-communications between right IOC and bilateral CG during visual attention processing may significantly contribute to behavioral manifestations of attention deficits in patients with TBI.

AB  - Recent studies suggest a possible link between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obesity risk, which would have implications for the development of obesity-related diseases in this population. The present study examined the association between PTSD and obesity and whether this association differed by sex in a representative sample of the US population. A secondary objective was to determine whether the association between PTSD and obesity was mediated by binge eating disorder (BED). Data were from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES), which comprises three nationally representative cross-sectional surveys that were conducted between 2001 and 2003. Logistic regression analyses weighted to represent the general US adult population were performed. In the total sample of 20,013 participants, rates of obesity were 24.1% for persons without a lifetime history of PTSD and 32.6% among persons with PTSD in the past year. Adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics, depression, substance and alcohol abuse/dependence, and psychotropic medication status, past year PTSD was associated with greater likelihood of obesity (odds ratio (OR) = 1.51; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.18, 1.95), with no differences by gender. BED did not statistically mediate the relationship between PTSD and obesity. The present study provides support for a link between PTSD and obesity. Findings further existing literature by indicating that the association is consistent across sexes and is not statistically mediated by BED.
