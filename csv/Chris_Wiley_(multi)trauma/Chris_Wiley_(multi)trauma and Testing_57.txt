AB  - Abstract. The authors have recently demonstrated that increased gene expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (Glu-6-Pase) in hemorrhagic hypotension (HH) and following lactated Ringer's resuscitation (LR) is associated with a decrease in insulin and an increase in corticosterone concentrations. Objective: To evaluate the in-vivo role of hormones the authors used insulin (IN), phentolamine and propranolol (PP) as an adrenergic blocker, and cyclic somatostatin (CS) as a glucagon blocker to prevent the induction of Glu-6-Pase gene expression in liver and kidney following HH and LR. Methods: Hemorrhage was induced in fasted anesthetized rats, and the reduction of blood pressure to 40 mm Hg for a duration of 30 minutes was accomplished by withdrawal or infusion of shed blood. The resuscitated group underwent hemorrhage followed by fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution. Results: Neither PP nor CS treatment could block the induction of Glu-6-Pase messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) following either HH or LR. However, the administration of IN significantly prevented the increase of Glu-6-Pase mRNA level and activity in both liver and kidney following HH and LR. This was associated with a normalization of plasma glucose, corticosterone, and glucagon levels and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations in liver and kidney toward prehemorrhage levels. Conclusions: These results indicate that in-vivo treatment with insulin during hemorrhagic hypotension and resuscitation is capable of preventing the increase in Glu-6-Pase gene expression in liver and kidney responsible for the observed hyperglycemia.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of splenectomy on cellular immunity. We studied the cellular phenotype and type 1 [interferon-?, interleukin-2 (IL-2)] and type 2 (IL-4 and IL-10) cytokine-producing peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in 22 healthy adults who had undergone post-traumatic splenectomy about 1 to 35 years ago. Splenectomy resulted in a long-term reduction of the percentage of CD4+CD45RA+ cells and a late increase of the percentage and absolute numbers of T-cell receptor ?/δ cells. Stimulation with Staphylococcal enterotoxin B resulted in normal IL-2 production by CD4+ T cells, indicating that the naïve cells were not anergic. Splenectomy also resulted in long-term priming of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. During the first 8 years, both type 1 and type 2 CD4+ T cells were primed to varying degrees. About 8 years later, the percentage of primed type 2 CD4+ T cells subsided, but that of type 1 CD4+ T cells, although decreased, remained detectable over a longer period. Priming of CD8+ T cells persisted throughout the study period. The long-term priming of type 1 CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which may result in partial impairment of T-cell functions, may explain reported defects of immune responses to recall antigens in splenectomized individuals. In addition, changes in the profile of primed CD4+ T cells with time may be clinically relevant to relapses in autoimmune thrombocytopenia after splenectomy.

AB  - Abstract Recent evidence suggests that military suicide rates now exceed those of the general public. Numerous recent efforts to address this growing concern have focused on the interpersonal psychological theory of suicidal behavior (IPTS). In the current study, we explored the relationships among reexperiencing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and the three components of the IPTS in a sample of deployed military personnel examined for traumatic brain injury. Results indicated that reexperiencing symptoms were directly related to the acquired capability for suicide, but their relationships to perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness were statistically explained by general mental health distress. Results indicate that mental rehearsal of painful and provocative experiences may have an impact on suicide risk. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Clin Psychol 67:1?10, 2011.

AB  - Abstract??? One of the commonly encountered dental emergencies is dentoalveolar traumatic injuries (DTIs). Unfortunately, DTIs result in fractured, displaced, or lost anterior teeth and this could have significant negative functional, esthetic, speech, and psychological effects on children thus affecting their quality of life. Although it is impossible to guarantee permanent retention of a traumatized tooth, patient age, severity of injury, and timely treatment and follow up of the tooth using recommended procedures can maximize the chances for success. This review examines the recent trends in the management of DTI to primary and young permanent teeth. Electronic search of scientific papers written in English from 1990s to 2009 was accomplished using Pub Med search engine. Dental practitioners should follow current literature and consider carefully evidenced-based recommendations that may enhance periodontal healing and revascularization of avulsed permanent teeth.

AB  - Abstract Aim:? To study the efficacy and complications of uterine tamponade using condom catheter balloon in non-traumatic postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Material and Methods:? This prospective study was conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital in India. Eighteen patients with non-traumatic PPH not responding to medical management were included in the study. Uterine tamponade was achieved by a condom catheter balloon filled with saline and kept in situ for 8?48?h. The main outcome measures were success rate in controlling hemorrhage, time required to stop bleeding, subsequent morbidity and technical difficulties. Data was analyzed using appropriate statistical methods. Results:? The success rate of condom catheter balloon in controlling hemorrhage was 94%. The mean amount of fluid filled in the condom catheter balloon was 409?mL. The average time taken to control bleeding was 6.2?min. The mean duration for which condom catheter balloon was left in situ was 27.5?h. The average amount of blood loss was 1330?mL. Five patients (28%) had infective morbidity. Conclusion:? Condom catheter balloon is effective in controlling non-traumatic PPH in 94% cases. It is effective, simple to use, easily available and is a cheap modality to manage non-traumatic postpartum hemorrhage, especially in limited resource settings.

AB  - Abstract Mild traumatic brain injury patients (mTBI) frequently report symptoms of increased distractability and sensory disturbances during mutisensory stimulation. These common post-concussive symptoms could putatively result from dysfunction within the cognitive control network (CCN; top-down) or from unisensory cortex (bottom-up) itself. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and high-resolution structural data were therefore prospectively collected during a multisensory (audio-visual) cognitive control task from 46 mTBI patients within 3 weeks of injury and 46 matched healthy controls (HC), with a subset of participants returning at 4 months. Multisensory stimuli were presented at two frequencies to manipulate cognitive and perceptual load. Patients self-reported more cognitive, emotional, somatic, vestibular and visual symptoms relative to HC, which improved, but did not entirely resolve, over the 4 month follow-up period. There were no group differences in behavior or functional activation during cognitive control (incongruent ? congruent trials). In contrast, patients exhibited abnormal activation within different regions of visual cortex that depended on whether attention was focused on auditory or visual information streams. Patients also exhibited increased activation within bilateral inferior parietal lobules during higher cognitive/perceptual loads, suggesting a compensatory mechanism to achieve similar levels of behavioral performance. Functional abnormalities within the visual cortex and inferior parietal lobules were only partially resolved at 4 months post-injury, suggesting that neural abnormalities may take longer to resolve than behavioral measures used in most clinical settings. In summary, current results indicate that abnormalities within unisensory cortex (particularly visual areas) following mTBI, which likely contribute to deficits commonly reported during multisensory stimulation.

AB  - Abstract Susceptibility to PTSD is determined by both genes and environment. Similarly, gene-expression levels in peripheral blood are influenced by both genes and environment, and expression levels of many genes show good correspondence between peripheral blood and brain. Therefore, our objectives were to test the following hypotheses: (1) pre-trauma expression levels of a gene subset (particularly immune-system genes) in peripheral blood would differ between trauma-exposed Marines who later developed PTSD and those who did not; (2) a predictive biomarker panel of the eventual emergence of PTSD among high-risk individuals could be developed based on gene expression in readily assessable peripheral blood cells; and (3) a predictive panel based on expression of individual exons would surpass the accuracy of a model based on expression of full-length gene transcripts. Gene-expression levels were assayed in peripheral blood samples from 50 U.S. Marines (25 eventual PTSD cases and 25 non-PTSD comparison subjects) prior to their deployment overseas to war-zones in Iraq or Afghanistan. The panel of biomarkers dysregulated in peripheral blood cells of eventual PTSD cases prior to deployment was significantly enriched for immune genes, achieved 70% prediction accuracy in an independent sample based on the expression of 23 full-length transcripts, and attained 80% accuracy in an independent sample based on the expression of one exon from each of five genes. If the observed profiles of pre-deployment mRNA-expression in eventual PTSD cases can be further refined and replicated, they could suggest avenues for early intervention and prevention among individuals at high risk for trauma exposure. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objective:? To investigate whether application of allergic patch tests with transparent semi-occlusive adhesive plastic foils yields higher test sensitivity than when tapes are used. To study whether such foils compared to tapes allow a shorter application time of tests. Methods:? We applied different doses of budesonide printed on polyester squares and vehicle control squares to budesonide allergic subjects for 4 days. Each subject was tested with a set of tests both with a tape and a foil. We assessed all tests when they had been detached and additionally those applied with foils at earlier time points. All assessments were performed both visually and with a laser Doppler perfusion imaging technique. Results:? Test sensitivity is higher with foil applications than when tapes are used and the perfusion is higher with the foils in many cases. The foils allow detachment of visually positive tests before 48 hours in some subjects, regardless of dose. Conclusions:? Test applications with transparent semi-occlusive adhesive plastic foils is sensitive and should be considered for application of patch tests when a short application time is important as when tests are carried out with occupationally hazardous allergens or when test substances containing allergens are expected to be irritating.

This dermatitis persisted despite the fact she had stopped the use of make up; she had acrylic artificial nails since 2 months and sometimes used hair dyes;patch tests were performed with Finn Chamber? tests with readings at D2 and D3, according ICDRG criteria, with European standard series, additional series (including toluenesulfonamide formaldehyde resin), cosmetic, acrylates, hairdressing series, in 3 patch test sessions, using Chemotechnique Diagnostics? allergens. Results:? The only positive patch test was coconut diethanolamide (0.5% pet.)++ at D2 and D3. After removal of the shampoo containing this allergen, the dermatitis cleared. Coconut diethanolamide (cocamide DEA), tensioactive synthesized with coconut oil is widely used in shampoos, soaps, shower gels, barrier creams, washing up liquids, metalworking fluids, hydraulic oils. Involvement of eyelids is not frequently described in the literature with this allergen. Conclusion:? Coconut diethanolamide should be added in cosmetic series, and it should be useful to test this allergen in patients with eyelid dermatitis.

AB  - Objective:? To investigate whether interleukins in blisters formed at patch-test sites can be used as markers of the grade of contact allergy. Methods:? Recently patch-tested volunteers with and without allergy to nickel sulfate were retested with 5 nickel sulfate patch tests and 5 control tests. 48 hours later, the test were removed and the perfusion of the test sites was assessed with a laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) technique. Then, suction blisters were made at the test sites. Blister fluids were collected separately from the allergen test sites and the control-test sites. Results:? The patch-test results prior to the study and in current study, and the results with the LDPI helped to distinguish between subjects with and without allergy to nickel sulfate. The concentration of one of the interleukins was high in the blister fluid from the nickel-test sites in all of the allergic subjects while the concentration was not detectable or low in fluid from the control sites and in fluid both from the nickel and the control sites in subjects without nickel allergy. Conclusion:? Immunological factors in fluid from blisters at patch-test sites may be important for the detection of contact allergy. Acknowledgement:? Icelandic Research Council.

AB  - Introduction NaHCO3 has been administered prior to racing in an attempt to enhance performance but it remains unclear whether potential ergogenic effects may be due to increased buffering capacity or expanded extracellular fluid volume. Methods Solutions of 1?g/kg of NaCl, KCl, NaHCO3, or KHCO3 in 8?L of water were administered via a nasogastric tube 60?min prior to a high intensity treadmill exercise test (12?m/s to fatigue) to 4 horses in a randomized fashion. Changes in mixed venous plasma electrolyte concentrations (NOVA Biomedical analyser) and run time to fatigue were compared by repeated measures ANOVA. Results Administration of Na and K salts increased Na and K concentrations before and during maximal exercise, respectively. Administration of bicarbonate salts attenuated acidosis and the decrease in bicarbonate concentration during exercise, as compared to Cl salts. Of interest, run time to fatigue was longer (P<0.001, power?=?0.98) after administration of KCl (5.1?±?0.6?min) as compared to both bicarbonate salts (3.7?±?0.6 and 3.6?±?0.8?min for NaHCO3 and KHCO3, respectively), but was not different than run time after NaCl administration (4.3?±?0.8?min). Conclusions Preloading with large amounts of Na and K salts produced expected changes in mixed venous Na and K concentrations but preloading with bicarbonate did not improve performance. Observation of longer run times to fatigue after administration of NaCl or KCl was unexpected and warrants further investigation.

AB  - Reimbursement policies for health care services are greatly diminishing in the U.S. and Western Europe. Hence, there is an increasing need for doctors and other care givers to reduce costs without compromising the quality of the care being delivered. The clinical laboratory is viewed as an area of high costs where significant reductions have been targeted. Efficient utilization of laboratory services can be achieved by elimination of the general health panel, removal of old tests or those that provide redundant information, a reduction in the use of standing orders, more judicious use of drug assays, acceptance of clinical practice guidelines, and use of reflex testing algorithms. New technologies such as DNA probes can substantially improve diagnostic efficiency. Point-of-care testing devices which have higher costs than incremental central laboratory expenses should only be used if they reduce overall operating expenses. Implementation of expert systems can make remaining tests more effective. Doctors and laboratorians must collaborate to achieve more efficient utilization practices.

AB  - Abstract The aim of the present study was to investigate a systemic induction of bone formation in rats by immunosuppression with FK506 (1 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally [ip]) in a model of osteoinduction of isogeneic and xenogeneic demineralized bone matrix (DBM) for a period of 28 days. In particular, alterations of in vitro cytokine synthesis and changes of lymphocyte subsets were studied. DBM was implanted intramuscularly in the abdominal wall of Lewis rats (seven per group). Blood was sampled on days ?7, 0, 7, and 28 for determination of in vitro tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) synthesis and lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD45+, ED9+, and Ia+ antibodies). Ossicles of de novo formed bone and the tibias were removed on day 28 after double tetracycline labeling for histomorphometric analysis. Immunosuppression with FK506 significantly decreased lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated in vitro cytokine synthesis after 7 days and 28 days (p < 0.05). Compared with control animals FK506 treatment significantly increased the volume of induced bone in isogeneic (2.1 ± 0.3 mm3 vs. 10.8 ± 0.9 mm3) and xenogeneic (0 mm3 vs. 4.7 ± 0.8 mm3) DBM. Bone histomorphometry of the tibias revealed that immunosuppression increased both bone formation and bone resorption, accompanied by a significant reduction in the relative trabecular area (Tb.Ar). FK506 caused a decrease in the counts of CD8+ T cells probably because of destruction or dislocation of these cells. This suggests that the amount of CD8+ cells and the degree of T cell activation in terms of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) may be associated with bone metabolism. In support of this, statistical analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between parameters of bone formation as well as bone resorption and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio. There was a significant negative correlation between parameters of remodeling of the metaphysis of the tibia and induced bone volume (BV), respectively, and MFI values of CD3+/Ia+ cells. These findings suggest an important role of T lymphocytes in bone formation and bone resorption in vivo. FK506 caused a marked increase of bone formation in DBM. However, the conclusion that immunosuppression increases fracture healing warrants further investigation.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this report was to review retrospectively the management of splenic trauma at a major Australian tertiary referral centre (Westmead Hospital) over a 10 year period. Forty-nine patients (0-15 years of age) with documented blunt splenic trauma were identified. The causes of splenic injury were road trauma (73%) and falls (27%). There were 22 minor injuries (Injury severity score [ISS] <16) and 27 severe injuries (ISS ≥16). All nine deaths were related to road trauma (mean ISS = 59). The investigation most commonly used was CT scanning (47%). Peritoneal lavage was performed in six patients (12%). Management involved non-operative care in 29 patients (57%), exploratory laparotomy alone in 5 (10%), splenic salvage in 2 (4%) and splenectomy in 13 (26%). This experience supports the view that non-operative management of splenic injury in haemodynamically stable children is safe and is the preferred treatment. Experienced assessment and meticulous observation is necessary. Laparotomy is indicated if there is continuing haemodynamic instability despite resuscitation. Operative management is aimed at splenic salvage with splenectomy being reserved for uncontrolled haemorrhage.

AB  - Abstract Background The purpose of this study was to compare the cerebral hemodynamic changes brought about by common carotid artery (CCA) digital compression and angiographic internal carotid artery (ICA) balloon occlusion. Methods Bilateral transcranial Doppler ultrasonographic monitoring of the middle cerebral artery blood velocity (VMCA) was performed in 12 subjects with neck neoplasms or traumatic carotid-cavernous fistulas. The MCA pulsatility index (PIMCA) and hemodynamic tension (Uhem MCA) were calculated. Results Common carotid artery compression provoked the largest drop in ipsilateral VMCA, PIMCA, and Uhem MCA. Common carotid artery compression caused a steal of blood from the intra- to the extracranial circulation, with the discrepancy in hemodynamic findings between CCA and ICA test occlusions being dependent on the quantity of reversed ipsilateral ICA blood flow. Conclusion If the carotid artery is to be sacrificed, permanent ICA closure is the procedure of choice with respect to the occurrence of cerebral ischemic lesions in patients with neck neoplasms and ICA flow reversal during CCA compression. ? 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Objectives:? The strip patch test (SPT), proposed by Spier and Sixt (Hautarzt 1955;6:152?9), is a modification of the patch test (PT). This technique is used to enhance penetration through the stratum corneum for poorly penetrating substances such as medicaments. So far, a standardised procedure is lacking. This multicentre study aims at standardising the SPT procedure. Methods:? A total of 83 healthy volunteers participated. In each subject, we determined the number of strips (A) until the surface became glistening and then calculated the median number of strips in the sample (??=?26). We ascertained the median number of strips in the sample (??=?11) that was necessary to achieve a first statistically significant and medically relevant increase of the TEWL revealing a critical stratum corneum strip depth. For the finally calculated number of strips for each subject (a/A?=?(?/?)?a?=?A???(?/?)), the actual increase in test sensitivity was substantiated employing SLS 0.125% aqueous. Standardisation results:? Perform stripping at one upper part of the back until the surface becomes glistening: gently press a 25?mm diameter adhesive tape downward vertically for about 2 seconds and then remove it in one quick movement at the angle in direction of adherence; continue stripping with a new tape cut on exactly the same skin area. Multiply number of strips by the correction factor (cf?=??/??=?11/26?=?0.4). Perform calculated number of strips likewise on the contralateral site and then apply there the test preparation for 24 hours. Conclusions:? If clinically an allergic contact dermatitis is expected but PT is negative, the SPT might reveal the potential allergen.

AB  - Abstract Results from efforts to develop and validate PTSD measures are promising, but a ?gold standard? has not been achieved. Keane, Malloy, and Fairbank (1984) have developed an MMPI PTSD subscale that has been crossvalidated with clinicians' classification of PTSD at acceptable levels of agreement, specificity, and sensitivity. There is, however, room for improvement. Empirical evidence is presented that indicates that the next round of efforts to increase reliability and validity of PTSD measures must account for the presence/abence of co-morbidity (i.e., the simultaneous occurrence of other psychiatric disorders). For example, differences are noted in MMPI group profiles and PTSD scales between psychiatric patients and substance abusers. Second, different MMPI items emerge as indicative of PTSD; these vary as a function of the presence of other Axis I disorders among groups of Vietnam combat veterans who seek treatment for substance abuse. Results substantiate that different MMPI items for classifying PTSD occur with groups that differ in co-morbidity. Improvements in PTSD scale development are more likely when the contributions of pre-existing or subsequently co-occurring psychiatric disorders are taken in account, as well as variations in level of personality maturity. The evidence suggests that a ?family? of PTSD scales need to be developed that take into account co-morbidity differences.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis Associations between olfactory function to quality-of-life (QOL) and disease severity in patients with rhinosinusitis is poorly understood. We sought to evaluate and compare olfactory function between subgroups of patients with rhinosinusitis using the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT). Study Design Cross-sectional evaluation of a multicenter cohort. Methods Patients with recurrent acute sinusitis and chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyposis were prospectively enrolled from three academic tertiary care sites. Each subject completed the B-SIT, in addition to measures of disease-specific QOL. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and clinical measures of disease severity were compared between patients with normal (BSIT ≥9) and abnormal (BSIT <9) olfaction scores. Regression modeling was used to identify potential risk factors associated with olfactory impairment. Results Patients with rhinosinusitis (n?=?445) were found to suffer olfactory dysfunction as measured by the B-SIT (28.3%). Subgroups of rhinosinusitis differed in the degree of olfactory dysfunction reported. Worse disease severity, measured by computed tomography and nasal endoscopy, correlated to worse olfaction. Olfactory scores did not consistently correlate with the Rhinosinusitis Disability Index or Sinonasal Outcome Test scores. Regression models demonstrated nasal polyposis was the strongest predictor of olfactory dysfunction. Recalcitrant disease and aspirin intolerance were strongly predictive of worse olfactory function. Conclusions Olfactory dysfunction is a complex, multifactorial process found to be differentially expressed within subgroups of rhinosinusitis. Olfaction was associated with disease severity as measured by imaging and endoscopy, with only weak associations to disease-specific QOL measures. Level of Evidence 2b.
