AB  - Objectives:? Diphenylmethane-4,4?-diisocyanate (MDI) is a very common isocyanate which is used in the plastics industry in its? polymeric form in the production of polyurethane products such as rigid and flexible foams, elastomers (rubbers) and coatings. Previous reports on MDI-related contact allergy have shown a pattern where patients seem to react to their own MDI-based work material but not to the commercial patch test preparations of MDI. Therefore, we performed chemical analysis of 14 commercial patch test preparations of MDI. Materials and Methods:? MDI preparations from 8 European and 4 American dermatology departments as well as preparations obtained from 2 major European suppliers of patch test allergens were analyzed with respect to MDI content using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Results:? None of the preparations obtained from dermatology departments contained more than 12% of the concentration stated on the label. In most cases the MDI content was only a few percentages or less of the concentration stated. In only 1 commercial preparation the MDI content came close to the declared concentration. Conclusion:? 7 of the 14 preparations were analyzed before the expiry date. Yet, only 1 of them contained a concentration that came close to that stated on the label. Thus, using these preparations patients will be tested with a much lower concentration than intended leading to a high risk of false-negative reactions and thereby underdiagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis from MDI.

AB  - Abstract Purpose. To evaluate the sonographic features of traumatic neuromas after neck dissection. Methods. This study included 8 patients whose ages ranged from 36?69 years (mean, 49 years). In all cases, traumatic neuromas were incidentally detected at neck sonography for evaluation of suspected recurrence of well-differentiated papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. All sonograms and medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Results. This study covered 8 cases in which traumatic neuromas were diagnosed by clinical, laboratory, fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), and other imaging modalities. None of the patients had clinical signs of neuromas, which were, incidentally, discovered by neck sonography. A noticeable sonographic feature in all cases was an isoechoic mass with internal parallel heterogeneous hyperechogenicity. All patients complained of severe pain during FNAB. The cytological results of 2 patients showed fragments of nerve tissue. The remaining 6 FNABs were nondiagnostic. Thyroglobulin (Tg) levels in washout fluids from FNAB of all patients were <0.2 ng/mL, indicating nonthyroidal origin. Conclusion. Distinctive sonographic features, sharp pain during FNAB, and low Tg levels in FNAB washout fluid can help to diagnose traumatic neuromas without surgery. ? 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract This paper will review issues in clinical assessment of minority combat veterans who served in Vietnam. We will specify differences and similarities for assessing minorities within the context of evaluating the larger combat veteran population. As a way of introducing a need for specialized diagnosis and treatment, we will present data demonstrating that minorities may be characterized as a distinct group among Vietnam combat veterans; data demonstrating differential rates of PTSD and other psychological disorders; as well as differences in vocational, social, educational, physical and health adjustment along with differential rates of health services utilization. Throughout this paper, we will attempt to give a historical perspective to the role of the minority soldier before, during, and after military service in Vietnam, as well as inter-related civilian events that impacted minority veterans. We will review pertinent theories that explain higher PTSD rates among minority veterans-considering the special nature of the Vietnam War and its impact on young minority soldiers. We will frankly discuss problems we have observed about clinician prejudice that adversely affect clinical assessment and treatment. We emphasize that every combat veteran, regardless of racial background, is a unique individual with his or her own unique story to tell. We are aware, though, that cross-cultural interactions, because of factors internal to both client and clinician, can impede, if not preclude, effective therapeutic encounter. We recognize that providing information about minorities may do relatively little to alter deeply rooted prejudice of an unconscious nature. We hope to address the issues of ethnicity in ways that do not stir clinical resistance but rather that enhance clinician sensitivity, curiosity, and confidence.

AB  - To review the prevalence of depression among adolescents and young adults after moderate to severe TBI. A systematic literature search was conducted on literature published up to December 2018 in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane and PsychInfo. A systematic review of the identified literature was based on PRISMA guidelines. Risk of Bias was evaluated based on the aspects of Risk of Bias assessment described by the Agency of Health Research and Quality. Seven studies were deemed eligible and information on the prevalence of depression among adolescents and young adults (age 13?35) after moderate to severe TBI was extracted. Depression was assessed at 12 months (n = 2), >12 months (n = 2) or at varying times (n = 3) after TBI. The identified studies reported a prevalence proportion of depression from 1.6% to 60%. The Risk of Bias assessment showed a range of study quality with the selection of subjects and analysis of attrition being problematic. Although literature is sparse and of varying quality, depression was found to be common among adolescents and young adults with moderate to severe TBI which implies a need to focus on depression in the rehabilitation process and calls for further research.

AB  - Abstract Material extrusion-based additive manufacturing, also known as fused filament fabrication (FFF) or 3D printing facilitates the fabrication of cranial implants with different materials and complex internal structures. The impact behavior plays a key role in the designing process of cranial implants. Therefore, the performance of impact tests on novel implant materials is of utmost importance. This research focuses on investigating the dependency of the infill density and pattern on the impact properties of 3D-printed poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) sandwich specimens including internal rectilinear, gyroid, and 3D-honeycomb (3D-HC) structures. 3D-HC structures show higher impact forces and dissipated energies as well as dynamic stiffness values compared to rectilinear and gyroid structures at the same infill density. 70% infill 3D-HC and 100% infill rectilinear structures prove to be most promising. In addition, two different optimization techniques to further improve the impact properties of these specimens, namely a material and a topology optimization, are applied. Topology optimization shows promising results until first damage and material optimization regarding dissipated energies. However, both are not able to outperform the 3D-HC pattern.

AB  - Since the advent of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes in 1980, they have become the device of choice for providing long-term enteral nutrition. Despite their overall safety, a number of complications can occur after PEG placement. Bleeding is usually a minor complication associated with PEG placement that occurs soon after the procedure and is most often caused by puncture of an abdominal wall vessel. More severe bleeding can occur when a branch of one of the gastric arteries is punctured. There are only a few case reports of traumatic gastric ulceration secondary to the internal bolster of a PEG. The internal bolsters are either balloons or dome shaped, and are 1.5?2.0 cm in height. We report a case in which a patient developed hemorrhage from a gastric ulcer induced by a balloon-type PEG tube that was resolved only after replacement with a tube manufactured with a low-profile internal bolster that was only 0.3 mm in height. The protruding tip of a balloon-type gastrostomy tube was believed to have caused traumatic injury to the gastric mucosa in our patient, causing ulceration. Usually, removal of the tube and placement in a different location may solve the problem. However, we believe that the PEG tube fashioned with a low-profile internal bumper is a safer option.

AB  - This paper examines risk factors for the development of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and its severity and chronicity, in a group of 217 young adults who survived a shipping disaster in adolescence. The survivors were followed up 5 to 8 years after the disaster. Risk factors examined fell into three main categories: pre-disaster child and family vulnerability factors, including childhood psychopathology; objective and subjective disaster-related experiences; and post-disaster factors, including results from screening questionnaires administered 5 months post-disaster, coping mechanisms adopted subsequently, life events, and availability of social supports. Developing PTSD following the disaster was significantly associated with being female, with pre-disaster factors of learning and psychological difficulties in the child and violence in the home, with severity of exposure to the disaster, survivors' subjective appraisal of the experience, adjustment in the early post-disaster period, and life events and social supports subsequently. When all these factors were considered together, measures of the degree of exposure to the disaster and of subjective appraisal of life threat, and ratings of anxiety obtained 5 months post-disaster, best predicted whether survivors developed PTSD. For those survivors who developed PTSD, its duration and severity were best predicted not by objective and subjective disaster-related factors, but by pre-disaster vulnerability factors of social, physical, and psychological difficulties in childhood together with ratings of depression obtained 5 months post-disaster, and whether survivors received post-disaster support at school. The implications of these findings are considered for targeting assessment and intervention efforts at survivors most at risk of developing difficulties in adjustment following similar traumatic experiences.

AB  - Objectives To determine the underlying disease prevalence in acute feline dyspnoea and to examine whether historical and clinical examination findings can differentiate between acute cardiac and non-cardiac dyspnoea in cats in primary practice. Materials and Methods We prospectively enrolled cats presenting with dyspnoea for the first time to primary practice between June 1, 2011 and October 31, 2016. We collected signalment, historical and clinical data at presentation using a standard form. Cases were investigated by primary clinicians, and the final diagnosis was confirmed by the authors. Records lacking critical data were excluded. Relationships between historical or clinical variables and dyspnoea aetiology were examined. Diagnostic test performance analyses were used to find optimal cut-off values for select historical or clinical variables that could differentiate cardiac and non-cardiac dyspnoea. Results Participants included 108 cats. A definitive diagnosis was reached in 92 cases; 60 were cardiac (65%), 15 respiratory (16%), 10 neoplastic (11%) and 7 traumatic (8%). Of cats with cardiac dyspnoea, 25% had a history of cough. A gallop sound, rectal temperature less than 37·5°C, heart rate of greater than 200?bpm and respiratory rate greater than 80 per minute were all useful to predict cardiac-associated dyspnoea. A triage algorithm using these findings in combination was designed to optimise the rapid diagnosis of probable cardiac dyspnoea. Clinical Significance Dyspnoeic cats presenting in practice with hypothermia, tachycardia, gallop sounds or profound tachypnoea are likely to have a cardiac cause underlying their dyspnoea. Although diagnosis requires confirmation, clinicians may be able to stratify risk and prioritise further investigation based on these findings.

AB  - The preset response surface designs often lack the ability to adapt the design based on the characteristics of application and experimental space so as to reduce the number of experiments necessary. Hence, they are not cost effective for applications where the cost of experimentation is high or when the experimentation resources are limited. In this paper, we present an adaptive sequential methodology for n-dimensional response surface optimization (n-dimensional adaptive sequential response surface methodology (N-ASRSM)) for industrial experiments with high experimentation cost, which requires high design optimization performance. We also develop a novel risk adjustment strategy for effectively considering the effect of noise into the design. The N-ASRSM is a sequential adaptive experimentation approach, which uses the information from previous experiments to design the subsequent experiment by simultaneously reducing the region of interest and identifying factor combinations for new experiments. Its major advantage is the experimentation efficiency such that, for a given response target, it identifies the input factor combination in less number of experiments than the classical response surface methodology designs. We applied N-ASRSM to the problem of traumatic brain injury modeling and compared the result with the conventional central composite design. Also, through extensive simulated experiments with different quadratic and nonlinear cases, we show that the proposed N-ASRSM method outperforms the classical response surface methodology designs and compares favorably with other sequential response surface methodologies in the literature in terms of both design optimality and experimentation efficiency.

Fungal hyphae (KOH and Calcofluor) were seen on direct microscopy of lung biopsy sample and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample. C. globosum isolated on culture clinched the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary infection by Chaetomium spp. A positive galactomannan of serum and BAL was repeatedly seen and was utilised for follow-up and as prognostic marker in patient management. The patient was successfully treated with liposomal amphotericin B followed by voriconazole. All the Chaetomium infections reported till date since 1980 are reviewed. Chaetomium spp. with its unique ecology has a hidden clinical potential to cause invasive mould infections.

AB  - Objectives. To compare levels of depression, anxiety, and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) amongst immigration detainees with a comparison group of asylum seekers living within the community. Design. A cross-sectional questionnaire study. Method. Sixty-seven detained asylum seekers, 30 detainees who had previously been imprisoned within the UK for criminal offences, and 49 asylum seekers living in the community completed the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and the impact of event scale-revised (IES-R). Demographic information was collected. Results. High levels of anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms were reported by all three groups. Detained asylum seekers had higher scores than asylum seekers living within the community for depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. There was an interaction between length of detention period and prior exposure to interpersonal trauma (IP trauma) on depression scores. Conclusions. Immigration detainees are highly vulnerable to psychological distress. A review of detention policies is recommended in light of this. Immigration detention may have an independent adverse effect on mental health. It is also possible that individuals with mental health problems may be more likely to be detained. Further research is required to investigate this.

AB  - Abstract The periosteum serves as bone's bounding membrane, exhibits hallmarks of semipermeable epithelial barrier membranes, and contains mechanically sensitive progenitor cells capable of generating bone. The current paucity of data regarding the periosteum's permeability and bidirectional transport properties provided the impetus for the current study. In ovine femur and tibia samples, the periosteum's hydraulic permeability coefficient, k, was calculated using Darcy's Law and a custom-designed permeability tester to apply controlled, volumetric flow of phosphate-buffered saline through periosteum samples. Based on these data, ovine periosteum demonstrates mechanically responsive and directionally dependent (anisotropic) permeability properties. At baseline flow rates comparable to interstitial fluid flow (0.5?µL/s), permeability is low and does not exhibit anisotropy. In contrast, at high flow rates comparable to those prevailing during traumatic injury, femoral periosteum exhibits an order of magnitude higher permeability compared to baseline flow rates. In addition, at high flow rates permeability exhibits significant directional dependence, with permeability higher in the bone to muscle direction than vice versa. Furthermore, compared to periosteum in which the intrinsic tension (pre-stress) is maintained, free relaxation of the tibial periosteum after resection significantly increases its permeability in both flow directions. Hence, the structure and mechanical stress state of periosteum influences its role as bone's bounding membrane. During periods of homeostasis, periosteum may serve as a barrier membrane on the outer surface of bone, allowing for equal albeit low quiescent molecular communication between tissue compartments including bone and muscle. In contrast, increases in pressure and baseline flow rates within the periosteum resulting from injury, trauma, and/or disease may result in a significant increase in periosteum permeability and consequently in increased molecular communication between tissue compartments. Elucidation of the periosteum's permeability properties is key to understanding periosteal mechanobiology in bone health and healing, as well as to elucidate periosteum structure and function as a smart biomaterial that allows bidirectional and mechanically responsive fluid transport. ? 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Summary The purpose of this prospective study was to enumerate Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)+ cells and measure their function using synthetic oligonucleotides enriched in CG dinucleotide motifs (CpG)-induced proliferation within 48?h after trauma in severely injured patients prone to sepsis. Sixteen consecutive trauma patients with an injury severity score (ISS)?>?21 and 16 blood donors (controls) were included in this study. Using two-colour flow cytometry, TLR9 expression was detectable intracellularly and also on the surface of B lymphocytes. The surface expression of TLR9 of B lymphocytes from whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated with CpG was significantly increased in B cells of severely injured patients prone to sepsis compared to controls. No significant differences could be observed between CpG-induced proliferation of PBMC of severely injured patients prone to sepsis and controls. As a measure of immunosuppression, human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression of monocytes of the trauma patients was significantly diminished compared with controls in PBMC and in whole blood. Immunosuppression in the early phase after trauma seems not to be associated with a disturbed sensing of bacterial DNA.

AB  - A new fragrance mix (FM II) with 6 frequently used chemicals was evaluated in consecutive patients patch tested in 6 dermatological centres in Europe. 28% FM II contained 5% Lyral, 1% citral, 5% farnesol, 5% coumarin, 1% citronellol and 10% alpha-hexyl cinnamic aldehyde (AHCA); in 14% FM II the single constituents? concentrations was lowered to 50% and in 2.8% FM II to 10%. Each patient was classified regarding a history of adverse reactions to fragrances: certain, probable, questionable and none. The frequency of positive reactions to the currently used 8% fragrance mix (FM I) and the new mix in 1703 patients was as follows: FM I, 6.6%; 2.8% FM II, 1.3%; 14% FM II, 2.9%; 28% FM II, 4.1%. The number of doubtful/irritant reactions was 7.2% for FM I and ranged from 1.8% to 10.6% for FM II. 8.7% of tested patients had a certain fragrance history. Of these 25.2% were positive to FM I, reactivity to FM II was dose-dependent and ranged from 8.1% to 17.6% in this subgroup. Comparing 2 groups of history ? certain and none ? values for sensitivity (sens) and specificity (spec) were calculated. Sens: FM I, 27.2%; 2.8% FM II, 8.7%; 14% FM II, 15.9%; 28% FM II, 21.5%. Spec: FM I, 96.3%; 2.8% FM II, 99.5%; 14% FM II, 98.7%; 28% FM II, 97.9%. 31/70 (44.3%) patients positive to 28% FM II were negative to FM I. In the group of patients with a certain history a total of 6 patients was found reacting only to FM II. Simultaneous break-down testing with the single constituents produced positive reactions in 54.3% for 28% FM II and 48% for 14% FM II. Lyral was the dominating single constituent with positive reactions (37.1% for 28% FM II, 36% for 14% FM II), followed by citral, farnesol, citronellol, AHCA and coumarin. Chemical analysis for the 6 constituents of FM II was performed on 25 products used by 12 patients being patch test positive to FM II. Lyral was detected in 76% of these products, citral in 16% and AHCA in 8%. In conclusion, the new FM II detects additional patients with contact allergy to fragrances missed by the currently used FM I. The medium concentration, 14% FM II, is probably the most useful one for diagnostic screening.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to report the minimum test battery needed to screen non-strabismic binocular vision anomalies (NSBVAs) in a community set-up. When large numbers are to be screened we aim to identify the most useful test battery when there is no opportunity for a more comprehensive and time-consuming clinical examination. Methods The prevalence estimates and normative data for binocular vision parameters were estimated from the Binocular Vision Anomalies and Normative Data (BAND) study, following which cut-off estimates and receiver operating characteristic curves to identify the minimum test battery have been plotted. In the receiver operating characteristic phase of the study, children between nine and 17 years of age were screened in two schools in the rural arm using the minimum test battery, and the prevalence estimates with the minimum test battery were found. Results Receiver operating characteristic analyses revealed that near point of convergence with penlight and red filter (> 7.5 cm), monocular accommodative facility (< 10 cycles per minute), and the difference between near and distance phoria (> 1.25 prism dioptres) were significant factors with cut-off values for best sensitivity and specificity. This minimum test battery was applied to a cohort of 305 children. The mean (standard deviation) age of the subjects was 12.7 (two) years with 121 males and 184 females. Using the minimum battery of tests obtained through the receiver operating characteristic analyses, the prevalence of NSBVAs was found to be 26 per cent. Near point of convergence with penlight and red filter > 10 cm was found to have the highest sensitivity (80 per cent) and specificity (73 per cent) for the diagnosis of convergence insufficiency. For the diagnosis of accommodative infacility, monocular accommodative facility with a cut-off of less than seven cycles per minute was the best predictor for screening (92 per cent sensitivity and 90 per cent specificity). Conclusion The minimum test battery of near point of convergence with penlight and red filter, difference between distance and near phoria, and monocular accommodative facility yield good sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of NSBVAs in a community set-up.

AB  - ABSTRACT A thorough understanding of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) function and the effects of surgical interventions on knee biomechanics requires robust technologies and simulation paradigms that align with clinical insight. In vitro orthopedic biomechanical testing for the elucidation of ACL integrity doesn't have an established testing paradigm to simulate the clinical pivot shift exam on cadaveric specimens. The study aim was to develop a robotically simulated pivot shift that represents the clinical exam. An orthopedic surgeon performed a pivot shift on an instrumented ACL-deficient cadaver leg to capture 6 degree-of-freedom motion/loads. The same knee was mounted to the robot and the sensitivity of the motion/loading profiles quantified. Three loading profile candidates that generated positive pivot shifts on the instrumented knee were selected and applied to 7 ACL-intact/deficient specimens and resulted in the identification of a profile that was able to induce a positive pivot shift in all ACL-deficient specimens ( p?<?0.001). The simulated shifts began at 22?±?8° and ended at 33?±?6° of flexion with the average magnitude of the shifts being 12.8?±?3.2?mm in anterior tibial translation and 17.6?±?4.3° in external tibial rotation. The establishment and replication of a robotically simulated clinical pivot shift across multiple specimens show the robustness of the loading profile to accommodate anatomical and experimental variability. Further evaluation and refinement should be undertaken to create a useful tool in evaluating ACL function and reconstruction techniques. Statement of clinical significance: Creation and successful demonstration of the simulated clinical pivot shift validates a profile for robotic musculoskeletal simulators to analyze ACL related clinical questions. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - 1. The compensation of fluid loss from the circulation after an LD50 period of bilateral hind-limb ischaemia in a thermoneutral environment has been studied in the rabbit from birth until young adulthood. 2. The fluid loss from the circulation was calculated from the increase in the great vessel haematocrit value as the red cell volume and Fcells were unchanged after limb ischaemia. This ?apparent? fluid loss was compared with the ?actual? fluid loss calculated from the increase in water content of the injured limbs. 3. The 0- to 1-day-old rabbit was better able to restore fluid, and protein, to the circulation than the older animal and suffered a smaller percentage reduction in arterial blood pressure after an LD50 period of ischaemia. 4. The better compensation of post-traumatic fluid loss during the first 48 hr of life may be explained by the high capillary filtration coefficient and the post-traumatic increase in plasma protein osmotic pressure found at that age. 5. The more efficient restoration of the plasma volume by the 0- to 1-day-old rabbit may account for the increased ability to withstand post-traumatic fluid loss at that age.

AB  - Abstract Altered inflammation in the early stage has long been assumed to affect subsequent steps of the repair process that could influence proper wound healing and remodeling. However, the lack of explicit experimental data makes the connection between dysregulated wound inflammation and poor wound healing elusive. To bridge this gap, we used the established rabbit ear hypertrophic scar model for studying the causal effect of dysregulated inflammation. We induced an exacerbated and prolonged inflammatory state in these wounds with the combination of trauma-related stimulators of pathogen-associated molecular patterns from heat-killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa and damage-associated molecular patterns from a dermal homogenate. In stimulated wounds, a heightened and lengthened inflammation was observed based on quantitative measurements of IL-6 expression, tissue polymorphonuclear leukocytes infiltration, and tissue myeloperoxidase activity. Along with the high level of inflammation, wound healing parameters (epithelial gap and others) at postoperative day 7 and 16 were significantly altered in stimulated wounds compared to unstimulated controls. By postoperative day 35, scar elevation of stimulated wounds was higher than that of control wounds (scar elevation index: 1.90 vs. 1.39, p?<?0.01). Moreover, treatment of these inflamed wounds with Indomethacin (at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, and 0.4%) reduced scar elevation but with adverse effects of delayed wound closure and increased cartilage hypertrophy. In summary, successful establishment of this inflamed wound model provides a platform to understand these detrimental aspects of unchecked inflammation and to further test agents that can modulate local inflammation to improve wound outcomes.

AB  - ABSTRACT Based on data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 1,149), the current article provides the first large-sample investigation of associations between different forms of infant attachment insecurity and dissociative symptomatology from childhood through midadolescence as measured by scales based on the mother, teacher, and youth self-report versions of the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessments. Findings did not replicate the previously reported and highly cited evidence that infant attachment disorganization is associated with dissociative symptomatology. In contrast, correlations of small magnitude were observed between infant avoidance and dissociative symptomatology, as assessed by teachers and mothers (but not self-report). Results were not moderated by contextual risk. Limitations of the study included the absence of measures of maltreatment and interpersonal trauma, leaving open the possibility that infant attachment disorganization is a diathesis for later dissociation in the context of severe and/or chronic trauma. Nevertheless, the present results strongly indicate the need for additional research exploring the possible role of environmental factors in the development of dissociative symptomatology.

AB  - Abstract Objective This study investigated the incidence and determinants of chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) in a general surgical patient population. Design This is a prospective cross-sectional study at a university-affiliated clinic/level 1 trauma center. Patients were followed at least 1 year postoperatively. By surgical discipline, procedures were 50% orthopedic/trauma, 33% general (abdominal/visceral), and 17% vascular. Setting All patients admitted during one year (N?=?3020) were eligible. Exclusion criteria were cognitive impairment, communication/language barrier, nonoperative treatment, and refusal to participate. A CPSP questionnaire was completed. Step-by-step analysis followed with a 2nd questionnaire to detect CPSP with numeric rating scale (NRS) pain intensity ≥3. Finally, individual follow-up examinations were performed. Results 911 patients responded (30.2%). 522 complained of pain intensity ≥3 on NRS (scale 0?10). The second step identified 214 patients with chronic pain (NRS ≥3, mean 29 months postoperatively). On final examination, 83 CPSP patients (14.8%) were identified. By surgical discipline, 28% were general, 15% vascular, and 57% trauma/orthopedic surgery. Most oftenly cited pain sites were joint (49.4%), incisional/scar (37.7%), and nerve pain (33.7%). By procedure, patients underwent pelvic surgery, colon surgery, laparoscopies, inguinal herniorrhaphies, arthroscopies, and hardware extractions. All patients in the ?laborer? and ?unemployed? categories reported chronic pain. Conclusion Bias due to study design and/or heterogeneity of patients is possible, but there was a high CPSP rate after 2 years both generally and particularly in orthopedic/trauma (57%) patients. Both ?major? and ?minor? surgical procedures led to CPSP.
