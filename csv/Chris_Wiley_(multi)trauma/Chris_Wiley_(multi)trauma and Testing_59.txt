AB  - Concomitant sensitizations to Nickel, Cobalt and Chromate are often observed among patch test patients. However, the reasons for being sensitized to two or more of these substances are not completely understood. Examination of IVDK (http://www.ivdk.org) patch test results with multivariate procedures has been conducted to further elucidate the mechanisms involved with these sensitizations and potential exposure factors that may have led to the concomitant sensitizations. Gender, age, occupational dermatitis, and construction work were considered and examined with multivariate logistic regression models with the dependent response variable being concurrent reactions to a metal pair versus no reactions. In addition to the aforementioned anamnestic data, examination of a poly-sensitizations variable (reactions to 1, 2, or 3 standard series allergens other than Nickel, Cobalt or Chromate) provided information regarding general susceptibility to positive patch test reactions. Combined reactions to Cobalt and Chromate were strongly linked to construction work (OR?=?11.23 (7.46, 16.90)) and occupational dermatitis. Female patch test patients had a higher odds of a positive patch test reaction to both Nickel and Cobalt (OR?=?4.73 (3.81, 5.87)). Sensitization to other, unrelated standard series substances was associated with concurrent reactions to all of the metal pairs. The association between construction work and Cobalt-Chromate reactions corresponds with the hypothesis that cement exposures lead to cobalt-chromate sensitizations. Individual susceptibility to delayed-type sensitizations, as represented by the poly-sensitization variable, also appears to be associated with coupled sensitizations to metals and warrants further examination.

AB  - Objectives Prevalence and risk factors of PTSD among injured garment workers who survived a major factory collapse. Methods Survivors receiving treatment or rehabilitation care at one year post event were surveyed, which included Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Specific version. Results The respondents consisted of 181 people with a mean age of 27.8 years and a majority had less than high school education (91.2%). Multivariable logistic regression found that the odds of having PTSD was higher among married (OR: 3.2 [95% CI: 1.3?8.0]), those who used to work more than 70?hr/week (OR: 2.4 [1.1?5.3]), workers who used to hold higher job positions (OR: 2.6 [1.2?5.6]) or who had a concussion injury (OR: 3.7 [1.4?9.8]). Among the respondents, 83.4% remained unemployed, and only 57.3% (63 people) reported receiving a quarter or less of what they were promised as compensation. Conclusions Probable PTSD was prevalent among surviving workers of the Rana Plaza building collapse in Bangladesh. Am. J. Ind. Med. 58:756?763, 2015. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Diseases that jeopardize the musculoskeletal system and cause chronic impairment are prevalent throughout the Western world. In Germany alone, ~1.8 million patients suffer from these diseases annually, and medical expenses have been reported to reach 34.2bn Euros. Although musculoskeletal disorders are seldom fatal, they compromise quality of life and diminish functional capacity. For example, musculoskeletal disorders incur an annual loss of over 0.8 million workforce years to the German economy. Among these diseases, traumatic skeletal muscle injuries are especially problematic because they can occur owing to a variety of causes and are very challenging to treat. In contrast to chronic muscle diseases such as dystrophy, sarcopenia, or cachexia, traumatic muscle injuries inflict damage to localized muscle groups. Although minor muscle trauma heals without severe consequences, no reliable clinical strategy exists to prevent excessive fibrosis or fatty degeneration, both of which occur after severe traumatic injury and contribute to muscle degeneration and dysfunction. Of the many proposed strategies, cell-based approaches have shown the most promising results in numerous pre-clinical studies and have demonstrated success in the handful of clinical trials performed so far. A number of myogenic and non-myogenic cell types benefit muscle healing, either by directly participating in new tissue formation or by stimulating the endogenous processes of muscle repair. These cell types operate via distinct modes of action, and they demonstrate varying levels of feasibility for muscle regeneration depending, to an extent, on the muscle injury model used. While in some models the injury naturally resolves over time, other models have been developed to recapitulate the peculiarities of real-life injuries and therefore mimic the structural and functional impairment observed in humans. Existing limitations of cell therapy approaches include issues related to autologous harvesting, expansion and sorting protocols, optimal dosage, and viability after transplantation. Several clinical trials have been performed to treat skeletal muscle injuries using myogenic progenitor cells or multipotent stromal cells, with promising outcomes. Recent improvements in our understanding of cell behaviour and the mechanistic basis for their modes of action have led to a new paradigm in cell therapies where physical, chemical, and signalling cues presented through biomaterials can instruct cells and enhance their regenerative capacity. Altogether, these studies and experiences provide a positive outlook on future opportunities towards innovative cell-based solutions for treating traumatic muscle injuries?a so far unmet clinical need.

AB  - Objective? To investigate the mechanical characteristics of a nontoxic, low-cost, rigid polymer (RP) and to compare the structural and mechanical properties of a full-frame external skeletal fixator (ESF) with either RP connecting bars, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) connecting bars, or stainless-steel (SS) clamps and connecting bars. Study Design? In vitro mechanical evaluation. Methods? Mechanical properties were assessed using an in vitro bone fracture model with a bilateral uniplanar ESF (type II). Identical ESF were built with connecting bars using RP (n = 8), PMMA (n = 8), and SS connecting bars and clamps (System Meynard; n = 3). Nondestructive mechanical tests were performed in uniaxial compression (AC) and craniocaudal (CC) 4-point bending, as well as fatigue AC. Composite stiffness for each specimen and for each loading mode was calculated from 6 replicate measures using the slope of the load displacement curve at small displacements. Results? RP, PMMA, and SS ESF constructs yielded mean ± SD composite stiffness values of 227 ± 15, 381 ± 30, and 394 ± 9 N/mm in AC and of 35 ± 2, 24 ± 2, and 15 ± 0 N/mm in CC, respectively. Conclusions? Structural and mechanical properties of RP are satisfactorily rigid and fatigue resistant for its use as a connecting bar in ESF. Clinical Relevance? RP connecting bars in an ESF are a reliable, versatile, nontoxic and inexpensive option for the veterinary surgeon.

AB  - Alcohol misuse remains the single most important contributing factor to road accident deaths and injuries in Australia. The results of compulsory blood alcohol tests on road casualties have shown that probationary licensed drivers have a threefold increased risk of road accident injury compared to fully licensed drivers and are additionally over-represented in alcohol-related crashes. These findings led the Victorian Road Trauma Committee to campaign for a zero blood alcohol limit for learner and probationary drivers and motorcyclists. In May 1984, zero blood alcohol legislation was enacted in Victoria. The present legislation applies to learner and first year probationary licence holders. For the first time we have evidence of a moderate reduction in alcohol-related road trauma in Victoria. Between 1977 and 1983 there has been a significant reduction in the proportion of driver casualties admitted to hospital with illegal blood alcohol concentrations and in the number of driver fatalities with blood alcohol concentrations in excess of 0.15 g%. An evaluation of the following recommended drink driver countermeasures is presented: improved driver education, increased penalties, re-education-rehabilitation programmes for convicted drink drivers, interlock devices and an increase in the legal drinking age.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? In the era of orally active agents, dynamic penile color-duplex ultrasound (D-PCDU) is not considered a necessary first screening for all patients with erectile dysfunction (ED). Various parameters, such as peak systolic flow velocity, end diastolic velocity, resistance index, acceleration time, and degree of arterial dilatation, have been suggested for the diagnosis of vascular ED by D-PCDU. Aim.? To highlight the clinical utility and evidence-based interpretation of D-PCDU criteria. Methods.? Extensive, unsystematic PubMed literature search reviewing relevant data on D-PCDU in the evaluation of male ED. Results.? The advantage of ultrasound is the minimally invasive nature of the procedure and the ability to screen patients to identify a normal arterial response of cavernous arteries. Men with sexual dysfunctions above 55 years of age and comorbidities are more likely to have multi-organ vascular dysfunction and may necessitate further testing because erectile failure may be the first presenting symptom requiring investigation and treatment even in the absence of cardiovascular risk factors. All patients affected with Peyronie's disease and younger men with persistent ED, a history of pelvic traumas, or fractures of the penile shaft should be offered ultrasonographic penile blood flow studies before referral to surgery or more invasive vascular investigations. Conclusions.? In the near future, D-PCDU may be used in preference to patients presenting with or without vascular risk factors, particularly those not responding to first-line orally active drugs and seeking an explanation as to why these agents failed.

AB  - Aim Hip fracture as a result of bone fragility is characterized by poor health outcomes in the medium and long term. Our goal was to compare a new orthogeriatric model with the old trauma model and evaluate improvements in clinical management. Methods We carried out a comparative unicentric study, a historical sample (trauma model) collected from 1 June 2007 to 31 May 2010, versus a prospective sample (orthogeriatric model) collected from 1 June 2010 until 31 May 2013. We included all patients aged >69 years with hip fracture as a result of bone fragility. Results A total of 792 patients were evaluated (mean age 84.3 years). The surgical waiting period went from 2.70 days in the trauma model to 1.86 days in the orthogeriatric model (P < 0.001); the average stay was 15.76 days in the trauma model, and for the orthogeriatric model was reduced to 5.90 days (P < 0.001); mortality went from 4.5% to 1.3% (P ≤ 0.010); 1 month readmission for hip dislocation was reduced from 2.3% to 0.5% (P = 0.032). After a 6-month follow up, we had 302 trauma model patients and 287 orthogeriatric model patients. After 1 year, we had 288 patients in the trauma model and 264 patients in the orthogeriatric model. The main cause of abandonment was death, 108 patients (27.3%) in the trauma model and 100 patients (27.5%) in the orthogeriatric model (P = 0.951). Conclusions When we compared the two models, we found statistically significant better results in the preoperative waiting period, average stay, hospital mortality and 1 month readmission as a result of hip prosthesis luxation in favor of the orthogeriatric model.

AB  - Abstract Background and Purpose Variability in clinical presentation among patients with neck pain disorders, in relation to symptom severity and the effect of the disorder on their physical and psychological function, has not been well documented. The present study examined the variability in pain intensity, physical and emotional or cognitive function in patients with non-acute, non-traumatic neck pain, and the extent to which these factors are associated at the time of referral for physiotherapy treatment. Method The study utilized a survey of patients referred for physiotherapy treatment for non-acute, non-traumatic neck pain. Seventy-two patients (mean age 58 years; SD 15.5 years) with a symptom duration ranging from four weeks to 30 years were recruited. Each completed measures of pain intensity using a visual analogue scale, and neck-pain related disability by use of the ?Neck Pain and Disability? scale (NPAD). Frequency distributions were calculated to examine variability in pain intensity, the total NPAD score and the effect of the disorder on different aspects of physical and emotional or cognitive function. Relationships between pain intensity, and physical and psychological function, were also examined. Results Pain intensity was normally distributed with a mean score of 6.3 cm (SD 2.5 cm). NPAD scores were normally distributed (mean 54.8%; SD 18%). Similar variability was noted in each of the NPAD factor scores for neck function, pain intensity, emotional or cognitive function and activities of daily living. Pain intensity was significantly (p<0.01) correlated with the total NPAD score (r = 0.55) and with each of the four effects of neck pain represented in the NPAD sub-domains (r = 0.42?0.63). Symptom duration was not significantly correlated with pain intensity, or with the severity of disability, as reflected in the total NPAD score. Conclusions The results highlight the variability between patients with neck pain, in relation to pain intensity and the effect of the disorder on physical and psychological function. Identifying the specific effects of the neck pain disorder in individual cases is important when defining the treatment objectives and selecting measures of treatment response.

AB  - Abstract Haemodynamic targets, such as cardiac output, mean arterial blood pressure and central venous oxygen saturations, remain crude predictors of tissue perfusion and oxygen supply at a cellular level. Shocked patients may appear adequately resuscitated based on normalization of global vital signs, yet they are still experiencing occult hypoperfusion. If targeted resuscitation is employed, appropriate use of end-points is critical. In this review, we consider the value of directing resuscitation at the microcirculation or cellular level. Current technologies available include sublingual capnometry, video microscopy of the microcirculation and near-infrared spectroscopy providing a measure of tissue oxygenation, whereas base deficit and lactate potentially provide a surrogate measure of the adequacy of global perfusion. The methodology and evidence for these technologies guiding resuscitation are considered in this narrative review.

AB  - Objective? To compare shear stability of simulated humeral lateral condylar fractures reduced with either a self-compressing pin or cortical bone screw. Study Design? In vitro biomechanical tests. Sample Population? Bilateral cadaveric canine humeri (n=18) without evidence of elbow disease. Methods? Lateral condylar fracture was simulated by standardized osteotomy. Bone fragments were stabilized with a self-compressing pin or a cortical bone screw (2.7 or 3.5?mm) inserted in lag fashion. Specimens were mounted in a materials testing system and the condylar fragment displaced in a proximal direction until failure. Mechanical testing variables derived from load?deformation curves were compared between stabilization methods using a Student's paired t-test. Results? There were no statistically significant differences for mechanical testing variables between pin and screw stabilized specimens at expected walk and trot loads. Three yield points subjectively coincided with yield of the interfragmentary interface (Y1), bone at the implant interface (Y2), and implant deformation (Y3). Displacements at Y1 were 48?156% greater for pin than screw stabilized specimens. Y2 and Y3 loads were higher for screw than pin stabilized specimens, but likely supraphysiologic for dogs convalescing after surgical repair. Conclusions? A self-compressing pin or a cortical bone screw inserted in lag fashion both provided adequate strength in applied shear to sustain expected physiologic loads through the repaired canine elbow during postoperative convalescence. Clinical Relevance? Because self-compressing pins were easy to implant and mechanical properties were not significantly different than cortical screws at expected physiologic loads, pins should be considered for the repair of traumatic humeral condylar fractures.

AB  - Abstract Free water elimination (FWE) in brain diffusion MRI has been shown to improve tissue specificity in human white matter characterization both in health and in disease. Relative to the classical diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model, FWE is also expected to increase sensitivity to microstructural changes in longitudinal studies. However, it is not clear if these two models differ in their test?retest reproducibility. This study compares a bi-tensor model for FWE with DTI by extending a previous longitudinal-reproducibility 3T multisite study (10 sites, 7 different scanner models) of 50 healthy elderly participants (55?80 years old) scanned in two sessions at least 1 week apart. We computed the reproducibility of commonly used DTI metrics (FA: fractional anisotropy, MD: mean diffusivity, RD: radial diffusivity, and AXD: axial diffusivity), derived either using a DTI model or a FWE model. The DTI metrics were evaluated over 48 white-matter regions of the JHU-ICBM-DTI-81 white-matter labels atlas, and reproducibility errors were assessed. We found that relative to the DTI model, FWE significantly reduced reproducibility errors in most areas tested. In particular, for the FA and MD metrics, there was an average reduction of approximately 1% in the reproducibility error. The reproducibility scores did not significantly differ across sites. This study shows that FWE improves sensitivity and is thus promising for clinical applications, with the potential to identify more subtle changes. The increased reproducibility allows for smaller sample size or shorter trials in studies evaluating biomarkers of disease progression or treatment effects.

AB  - Abstract Many factors can affect the characterisation of biomaterials during testing. Among them is the type of the testing solution, such as human, animal blood or saline solutions of even different composition. Further influencing factors are drugs that have been administered to the blood donor prior to testing. Experimental details affecting the quality of testing refer to the guidance of blood across the biomaterial leading to different shear stress on blood cells and specific blood donor conditions, such as the age, race and gender. Some of the misconceptions in testing are described here and serve to indicate that a systems approach, and not only individual test parameters, is best when reliably testing for the biocompatibility of biomaterials for further use in medical devices. Viele Faktoren können die Charakterisierung von Biomaterialien in der Testphase beeinflussen. Darunter fällt z.B. die Art der Testlösung, wie Humanblut oder tierisches Blut, NaCl-Lösungen verschiedener Tonizität, u. a. Weitere Einflussfaktoren sind Pharmaka, die der Blutspender vor der Blutspende zu sich genommen hat. Experimentelle Einflussgrößen sind auch die rheologischen Randbedingungen, mit denen die Testlösung über das Biomaterial geleitet wird, da damit unterschiedliche Scherraten auf Blutzellen ausgeübt werden. Für Blutspender findet man Unterschiede beim Testen je nach Alter, Rasse und Geschlecht des Spenders. In dieser kurzen Übersicht sollen einige grundsätzliche Fehler beim Testen von Biomaterialien angesprochen werden. Für das zuverlässige Testen von Polymeren und Biomaterialien ist ein Systemansatz notwendig, der nicht nur individuelle Testparameter in den Mittelpunkt stellt, sondern das gesamte Spektrum der klinischen Randbedingungen berücksichtigt.

AB  - Background Ethanol (EtOH) exposure prior to traumatic injury, such as a burn, elevates systemic and local inflammatory responses and increases morbidity and mortality. Adipose is a large tissue mass that is often inflamed during obesity or other stresses, which disturbs metabolic homeostasis. To date, there has been little investigation into the inflammatory response of adipose tissue after combined EtOH exposure and burn injury. Methods Two EtOH exposure regimens were utilized to examine the role of inflammation in adipose tissue after EtOH and burn injury. Mice were either given a single or episodic binge exposure to EtOH or saline followed by scald (burn) or sham injury 30 minutes later. Twenty-four hours post injury, serum and adipose tissue were collected for assessment of inflammatory mediators. Results Single binge EtOH alone induced no inflammation in adipose when compared with sham vehicle-treated mice. However, single binge EtOH followed by burn injury induced significant elevations in mRNA and protein concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators interleukin-6 (IL-6), KC, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 compared with either insult alone or sham vehicle group. Additionally, EtOH exposure and burn injury significantly blunted inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), indicating a complex inflammatory response. Episodic binge EtOH exposure followed by burn injury exacerbated the postburn adipose inflammatory response. The magnitude of the episodic binge-induced inflammatory parameters postburn were 2- to 5-fold greater than the response detected after a single exposure of EtOH, indicating EtOH-induced potentiation of burn-induced inflammatory response. Finally, inflammatory loci and crown-like structures in adipose were significantly increased by episodic binge EtOH and burn injury. Conclusions This is the first report of binge and burn-induced crown-like structure formation. Evidence presented herein suggests an important role for alcohol and burn as an additional mediator of adipose inflammation in postburn injury, a common complication in burn patients.

AB  - ABSTRACT Melorheostosis is a rare non-hereditary condition characterized by dense hyperostotic lesions with radiographic ?dripping candle wax? appearance. Somatic activating mutations in MAP2K1 have recently been identified as a cause of melorheostosis. However, little is known about the development, composition, structure, and mechanical properties of the bone lesions. We performed a multi-method phenotype characterization of material properties in affected and unaffected bone biopsy samples from six melorheostosis patients with MAP2K1 mutations. On standard histology, lesions show a zone with intensively remodeled osteonal-like structure and prominent osteoid accumulation, covered by a shell formed through bone apposition, consisting of compact multi-layered lamellae oriented parallel to the periosteal surface and devoid of osteoid. Compared with unaffected bone, melorheostotic bone has lower average mineralization density measured by quantitative backscattered electron imaging (CaMean: ?4.5%, p?=?0.04). The lamellar portion of the lesion is even less mineralized, possibly because the newly deposited material has younger tissue age. Affected bone has higher porosity by micro-CT, due to increased tissue vascularity and elevated 2D-microporosity (osteocyte lacunar porosity: +39%, p?=?0.01) determined on quantitative backscattered electron images. Furthermore, nano-indentation modulus characterizing material hardness and stiffness was strictly dependent on tissue mineralization (correlation with typical calcium concentration, CaPeak: r?=?0.8984, p?=?0.0150, and r?=?0.9788, p?=?0.0007, respectively) in both affected and unaffected bone, indicating that the surgical hardness of melorheostotic lesions results from their lamellar structure. The results suggest a model for pathophysiology of melorheostosis caused by somatic activating mutations in MAP2K1, in which the genetically induced gradual deterioration of bone microarchitecture triggers a periosteal reaction, similar to the process found to occur after bone infection or local trauma, and leads to an overall cortical outgrowth. The micromechanical properties of the lesions reflect their structural heterogeneity and correlate with local variations in mineral content, tissue age, and remodeling rates, in the same way as normal bone. ? 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research

AB  - Abstract Background:? There has been a growing need for a cognitive assessment tool that can be used for older adults with schizophrenia in clinical settings. The clock-drawing test (CDT) is a brief cognitive test that covers a wide range of cognitive function. Although it is widely used to assess patients with dementia, limited data are available on its usefulness in older patients with schizophrenia. Thus, we investigated the psychometric properties of the CDT and their relationship with life functions to examine the test's usefulness for assessing cognitive function in older adults with schizophrenia. Methods:? Seventy-three older adults with chronic schizophrenia who had been hospitalized for over 1?year participated in the study. We adopted the executive clock-drawing task for administration and scoring of the CDT, which consists of free-drawn and copy conditions. The Mini-Mental State Examination and the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia were administered. Symptom severity and life functions were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Life Skills Profile, respectively. Results:? Both free-drawn and copy scores significantly correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination score and the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia composite score. These scores also significantly correlated with symptom severity and length of current hospitalization. Stepwise regression analysis showed that only the copy score, together with symptom severity, predicted the Life Skills Profile score. Conclusions:? The CDT can assess cognitive function in older adults with schizophrenia. Moreover, CDT performance is associated with life functions independent from other clinical variables. These results suggest that the CDT is a useful cognitive assessment tool for this population.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to determine if early enteral nutrition improves outcome for trauma patients with an open abdomen (OA). Methods: Retrospective review was used to identify 78 patients who required an OA for ≥4 hospital days, survived, and had available nutrition data. Demographic data and nutrition data comprising enteral nutrition initiation day and daily % target goal were collected. Patients were divided into 2 groups: early enteral feeding (EEN), initiated ≤4 days within celiotomy; and late enteral feeding (LEN; >4 days). Outcomes included infectious complications, early closure of the abdominal cavity (<8 days from original celiotomy), and fistula formation. Results: Fifty-three of 78 (68%) patients were men, with a mean age of 35 years; 74% had blunt trauma. Forty-three of 78 (55%) patients had EEN, whereas 35 of 78 (45%) had LEN. There was no difference with respect to demographics, injury severity, or infectious complication rates. Thirty-two of 43 (74%) patients with EEN had early closure of the abdominal cavity, whereas 17 of 35 (49%) patients with late feeding had early closure (p = .02). Four of 43 (9%) patients with EEN demonstrated fistula formation, whereas 9 of 35 (26%) patients with late feeding formed fistulae (p = .05). The EEN group had lower hospital charges (p = .04) by more than $50,000. Conclusions: EEN in the OA was associated with (1) earlier primary abdominal closure, (2) lower fistula rate, (3) lower hospital charges.

AB  - Summary The majority of esthetic emergencies involve fracture of the clinical crown. Traumatic conditions such as avulsion, bony fracture, extrusive and lateral luxation, and root fracture are considered to be acute and demand immediate treatment. Subacute conditions, including intrusion, subluxation, pulpal concussion, and crown fracture with pulp exposure, necessitate treatment within 24?h. In most cases, the emergency-bonded composite restoration will be the definitive restorative treatment. In the case of an esthetic emergency shortly before a social engagement, a dislodged crown or fixed dental prosthesis can be temporarily retained through the application of a little denture adhesive. Although replacement of the prosthesis may ultimately be recommended, patients may need an immediate interim repair. The responsibility of the dentist is to facilitate the long-term preservation of the natural dentition, the supporting periodontium and bone, and the surrounding soft gingival tissues.

AB  - Aim In this observational study using 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor, we investigated the differential effects of pathology, stage of disease, state of consciousness, and aetiology on the modifications of supra- and infra-tentorial white matter tracts and their correlations with clinical scales in paediatric patients with severe non-traumatic brain injury. Method Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) was obtained from seven children with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS; five males, two females; age at event 5y; standard deviation [SD] 2y 1mo), six children in a minimally conscious state (MCS; three males, three females; age at event 5y 10mo; SD 5y), and 10 healthy children as controls(two males, eight females; age at study 10y 10mo; SD 2y 10mo). Fractional anisotropy, mean, axial, and radial diffusivities were calculated for the corpus callosum, inferior, middle (MCP), and superior cerebellar peduncles (SCP). Results DT-MRI parameters from corpus callosum and SCP differed between patients and controls. MCP abnormalities were detected in patients presenting non-traumatic composite aetiology (n=4) versus those suffering from pure anoxia (n=9). The supra-tentorial compartment was more damaged (i.e. decreased fractional anisotropy and increased diffusivities) than the infra-tentorial one. Correlations were found between DT-MRI abnormalities and Glasgow Outcome Scale scores. Interpretation In paediatric UWS/MCS, the severity of clinical disability correlates with white matter tract abnormalities.

AB  - Introduction Many jurisdictions measure plasma tCO2 to determine if racehorses may have been administered exogenous alkalinizers illegally (?milkshakes?). Our hypothesis was that plasma tCO2 test results vary within a racing jurisdiction due to inter-day instrument variability. Methods Individual or daily mean plasma tCO2 test results from New York (n?=?584) and Maine (n?=?443) Standardbreds and California Thoroughbreds (n?=?23,686) were obtained through legal discovery in adjudicated cases where trainers were accused of tampering with horses resulting in tCO2 concentrations ≥37.0?mmol/L. Daily results were grouped by days on which no horse tested ≥37.0?mmol/L (LOW) or days on which at least one horse tested ≥37.0?mmol/L (HIGH). HIGH days were further subsampled by eliminating ?positive? test results ≥37.0?mmol/L (MODIFIED HIGH). With P<0.05 considered significant, differences between groups were compared by Student's t test for means and Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test for medians. Results HIGH tCO2 means (32.9?±?2.6, 35.2?±?3.4, 32.6?±?2.7) and medians (32.9, 35.4, 32.6) for all 3 jurisdictions were higher than LOW means (31.7?±?2.3, 31.9?±?4.3, 31.5?±?0.7) and medians (31.8, 32.9, 31.5) (P<0.001). Even when ?positive? tests ≥37.0 were eliminated, MODIFIED HIGH means (32.5?±?2.2, 33.6?±?2.6, 32.4?±?2.5) and medians (32.7, 34.2, 32.5) were still higher than LOW (P<0.001). Conclusions Unless the population tCO2 mean varies significantly daily, it must be concluded that instrument variability resulted in day-to-day differences in plasma tCO2 test results. Without appropriate quality control including correction of individual suspect results to a contemporaneous standard curve, horse trainers may be accused unfairly of tampering when day-to-day instrument variability contributes to positive plasma tCO2 test results. Ethical Animal Research This was a retrospective study investigating laboratory results obtained through adjudication of legal cases before various racing commissions. Sources of funding:?none. Competing interests:?none.
