AB  - Abstract Introduction and Aims Despite advances towards integration of care for women with co-occurring substance use disorder (SUD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), low abstinence rates following SUD/PTSD treatment remain the norm. The utility of investigating distinct substance use trajectories is a critical innovation in the detection and refining of effective interventions for this clinical population. Design and Methods The present study reanalysed data from the largest randomised clinical trial to date for co-occurring SUD and PTSD in women (National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network; Women and Trauma Study). Randomised participants (n?=?353) received one of two interventions in addition to treatment as usual for SUD: (i) trauma-informed integrative treatment for PTSD/SUD; or (ii) an active control psychoeducation course on women's health. The present study utilised latent growth mixture models (LGMM) with multiple groups to estimate women's substance use patterns during the 12-month follow-up period. Results Findings provided support for three different trajectories of substance use in the post-treatment year: (i) consistently low likelihood and use frequency; (ii) consistently high likelihood and use frequency; and (iii) high likelihood and moderate use frequency. Covariate analyses revealed improvement in PTSD severity was associated with membership in a specific substance use trajectory, although receiving trauma-informed treatment was not. Additionally, SUD severity, age and after-care efforts were shown to be related to trajectory membership. Discussion and Conclusions Findings highlight the necessity of accounting for heterogeneity in post-treatment substance use, relevance of trauma-informed care in SUD recovery and benefits of incorporating methodologies like LGMM when evaluating SUD treatment outcomes.

AB  - Abstract ? Displacement injuries of permanent teeth are an increasing emergency in the dental office. Children and adolescents are particularly prone to dental trauma due to participation in risky activitiess. Repositioning or replantation with subsequent stabilization by a dental splint is the standard of care for most displaced or avulsed permanent teeth. Non-rigid fixation allowing physiologic tooth mobility has been shown to be desirable for periodontal healing. A flexible splint of short duration appears to reduce the risk of dentoalveolar ankylosis or external replacement resorption. Different splinting techniques are currently recommended for stabilization of repositioned or replanted teeth, including a wire-composite splint, an orthodontic bracket splint or a resin splint. Each splinting option has its specific advantages and shortcomings. This paper describes a new splinting technique which offers improved comfort and handling to the patient and dentist alike.

AB  - Recovery from the profound negative psychological and spiritual effects of genocide is essential for individuals to live fulfilling lives, engage in reconciliation, and prevent future violence. This article discusses community approaches to trauma recovery that focus on individuals within their social context. It briefly identifies common psychological problems that follow genocide. It then presents constructivist self development theory (CSDT) as a foundation for understanding these effects and the RICH (Respect, Information, Connection, and Hope) framework, based in CSDT, for designing and assessing the effects of post-genocide psychosocial interventions. The article reviews three approaches to collective recovery: a multifamily group approach, a psychoeducational program focused on youth, and a public education program aimed to promote trauma recovery and prevent future violence. The RICH framework is applied to each approach.

AB  - Summary Teeth have two regions where trauma can cause irreparable damage: the dental pulp and periodontium. The classification of the injury type, and signs and symptoms may not fully indicate the true extent of the injury, which may be multi-factorial. Exposure or near exposure of the pulp in the mouth and damage to the neurovascular bundle can result in one of several different outcomes for the dental pulp. The rate of pulp necrosis with a number of different injuries varies with age and the stage of tooth development. Endodontic treatment would only be commenced if there were signs and symptoms of an endodontic infection. A thorough history and examination are necessary to not only reveal the full extent of injuries to the teeth and jaws, but also to exclude more serious injuries, such as concussion and neck injuries, which may need urgent medical care.

AB  - SUMMARY HLA-DR expression on monocytes as marker for monocytic function is severely depressed after major trauma. The membrane enzyme aminopeptidase N/CD13 can trigger help in antigen processing by MHC class II molecules of antigen-presenting cells. We determined the simultaneous expression of HLA-DR and CD13 on peripheral blood monocytes of patients with major trauma (injury severity score of ≥16). 1?: 1 conjugates of phycoerythrin (PE)-to-monoclonal antibody were used in combination with QuantiBRITETM PE beads for a standardized quantification in terms of antibodies bound per cell (ABC). The very low expression of HLA-DR antigen on monocytes of patients at day 1 after major trauma confirmed previous results in the literature. Monocytic HLA-DR expression increased slowly to reach values in the lower range of healthy volunteers at day 14. Monocytic CD13 expression at day 1 showed values in the range of healthy volunteers, and a strong rise afterwards. Fourteen days after trauma, the monocytic expression of CD13 was still much higher than in the control group. Because lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 have been shown to be involved in the depressed HLA-DR expression on monocytes in trauma patients, we studied the in vitro effects of LPS and interleukin (IL)-10 on the expression of CD13 on monocytes prepared from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers. Whereas a 3-day IL-10 treatment resulted in a down-regulation of both HLA-DR and CD13 expression on monocytes, LPS caused a down-regulation of HLA-DR but a rapid up-regulation of CD13 levels. Therefore we suggest that, with respect to monocytic CD13 expression, LPS rather than IL-10 could well be the explanation for monocytic surface molecules after severe injury, although other mediators with a CD13 regulating function have to be considered.

AB  - Background and Objectives Smoking rates are markedly higher among trauma-exposed individuals relative to non?trauma-exposed individuals. Extant work suggests that both perceived stress and negative affect reduction smoking expectancies are independent mechanisms that link trauma-related symptoms and smoking. Yet, no work has examined perceived stress and negative affect reduction smoking expectancies as potential explanatory variables for the relation between trauma-related symptom severity and smoking in a sequential pathway model. Methods The present study utilized a sample of treatment-seeking, trauma-exposed smokers (n?=?363; 49.0% female) to examine perceived stress and negative affect reduction expectancies for smoking as potential sequential explanatory variables linking trauma-related symptom severity and nicotine dependence, perceived barriers to smoking cessation, and severity of withdrawal-related problems and symptoms during past quit attempts. Results As hypothesized, perceived stress and negative affect reduction expectancies had a significant sequential indirect effect on trauma-related symptom severity and criterion variables. Conclusions and Scientific Significance Findings further elucidate the complex pathways through which trauma-related symptoms contribute to smoking behavior and cognitions, and highlight the importance of addressing perceived stress and negative affect reduction expectancies in smoking cessation programs among trauma-exposed individuals.

AB  - ABSTRACT This article examines two novels by seminal German-language Jewish authors, Benjamin Stein's Die Leinwand (2010) and Eva Menasse's Quasikristalle (2013), to shed light on major shifts in Holocaust memory since the turn of the millennium. I argue that developments such as the disappearance of the eyewitness generation, coupled with the increasing hypermediation and globalisation of Holocaust memories, force us to reconsider certain conceptions of trauma which for a long time have dominated engagements with the Holocaust and its representation. Instead of approaching Holocaust trauma as unspeakable and inherently inaccessible, I propose to read the novels? engagements with the Holocaust through the lens of Terri Tomsky's concept of ?travelling trauma?, which allows us to conceive of the Holocaust as a culturally mediated signifier that moves transgenerationally, transmedially, and transnationally through various discursive networks. The novels by Stein and Menasse furthermore enable us to examine critically certain manifestations of ?travelling trauma? and the current state of Holocaust representation in a way that Tomsky's more descriptive approach does not.

AB  - Summary Treatment paradigms for bleeding and major vascular injury have evolved with the rise of endovascular surgery. Just over 2% of trauma patients suffer a vascular injury. The decision for endovascular or open intervention should be guided by the patient's clinical status, anatomy of the injury, and the resources available. Early endovascular procedures for solid organ injury are independently associated with a 35% reduction in mortality risk after controlling for major confounders, including mechanism of injury and presence of hypotension on arrival. In all-comers, the arterial injuries are transection (35%), occlusion (17%), partial transection/flow limiting defect (25%), pseudoaneurysm (9.0%), and other injuries including intimal defects (23%). Over half of the patients can be managed with non-operative management with a low 4% failure rate and conversion to intervention. Definitive endovascular and open repair were used in <10% and <25% of all patients, respectively, presenting to level 1 trauma centers.

AB  - Objective:? To construct a model on the consequences of political violence for refugee families based upon a qualitative investigation. Methods:? This study used a grounded-theory approach to analyze qualitative evidence from the CAFES multi-family support and education groups with Bosnian refugee families in Chicago. Textual coding and analysis was conducted using ATLAS/ti for Windows. Results:? A grounded-theory model of Family Consequences of Refugee Trauma (FAMCORT) was constructed that describes Displaced Families of War across four realms of family life: (1) changes in family roles and obligations, (2) changes in family memories and communications, (3) changes in family relationships with other family members; and (4) changes in family connections with the ethnic community and nation state. In each realm, the model also specifies family strategies, called Families Rebuilding Lives, for managing those consequences. Conclusions:? Political violence leads to changes in multiple dimensions of family life and also to strategies for managing those changes. Qualitative family research is useful in better understanding refugee families and in helping them through family-oriented mental health services.

AB  - Abstract Background There is a lack of research on trauma in people with intellectual disabilities. This study assessed expert consensus on the traumatic potential of a broader range of adverse life events, and differences in symptom manifestation and behavioural symptom equivalents of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Method The present authors conducted a three-step Delphi survey using a mixed-methods design. Twenty-nine expert raters participated in the survey, and 16 persisted to the final round. Consensus was calculated using the interquartile range. Results Traumatic potential was attributed to adverse life events, particularly revolving around sexuality and autonomy. DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD were rated as partially adequate, with behavioural symptom expression being the main difference to the general population. Conclusion The range of traumatic events should be broadened for people with intellectual disabilities. A specific subset of events need to be defined in future research. Detection of PTSD depends upon determining specific symptom correlates of challenging behaviour.

Developing and evaluating knowledge tests for use in multi-disciplinary post-graduate training is challenging. The objective of this study was to describe the process of developing and evaluating a multiple-choice question (MCQ) test for use in a multi-disciplinary training program in obstetric-anesthesia emergencies. Methods A multi-disciplinary working committee with 12 members representing six professional healthcare groups and another 28 participants were involved. Recurrent revisions of the MCQ items were undertaken followed by a statistical analysis. The MCQ items were developed stepwise, including decisions on aims and content, followed by testing for face and content validity, construct validity, item?total correlation, and reliability. Results To obtain acceptable content validity, 40 out of originally 50 items were included in the final MCQ test. The MCQ test was able to distinguish between levels of competence, and good construct validity was indicated by a significant difference in the mean score between consultants and first-year trainees, as well as between first-year trainees and medical and midwifery students. Evaluation of the item?total correlation analysis in the 40 items set revealed that 11 items needed re-evaluation, four of which addressed content issues in local clinical guidelines. A Cronbach's alpha of 0.83 for reliability was found, which is acceptable. Conclusion Content and construct validity and reliability were acceptable. The presented template for the development of this MCQ test could be useful to others when developing knowledge tests and may enhance the overall quality of test development.

AB  - Abstract Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a relatively highly prevalent psychiatric disorder that is associated with very high personal and socioeconomic costs. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of the relationship between complex trauma and key features of BPD, with a focus on problems with self-coherence and self-continuity. We first review evidence for the high prevalence of complex trauma in BPD patients. This is followed by a discussion of emerging knowledge concerning the biobehavioral mechanisms involved in problems related to self and identity in BPD. We emphasize three biobehavioral systems that are affected by complex trauma and are centrally implicated in identify diffusion in BPD: the attachment system, mentalizing or social cognition, and the capacity for epistemic trust?that is, an openness to the reception of social communication that is personally relevant and of generalizable significance. We formulate a new approach to personality and severe personality disorders, and to problems with self and identity in these disorders, rooted in a social-communicative understanding of the foundations of selfhood. We also discuss how extant evidence-based treatments address the above-mentioned biobehavioral systems involved in identity diffusion in BPD and related disorders, and the supporting evidence. We close the paper with recommendations for future research.

AB  - Abstract Background To investigate the prevalence of findings of spinal injury on computed tomography (CT) images of pediatric trauma patients and to define indicators for the possible presence of spinal injuries. Methods Spinal CT for pediatric trauma patients (age ≤ 12 years) over a 2-year period was retrospectively evaluated for the presence of findings suggestive of spinal injury. Results Of the 773 patients reviewed, 19 (2.4%) showed traumatic spinal lesions on their spinal CT images. These patients were significantly older than those without spinal lesions (mean age 7.9 ± 3.3 years vs 6.1 ± 3.3 years; P = 0.02). The prevalence of spinal trauma was significantly lower in patients aged 0?8 years than in those aged 9?12 years (P = 0.025). Spinal injury was significantly higher in female patients (P = 0.014). Most of the spinal injuries were located at the lumbar and sacral vertebral levels, and most did not cause neurological complications or require surgical treatment. Important indicators of the possible presence of spinal injuries were pain, tenderness, or ecchymosis over the spine, a low Glasgow Coma Scale score (≤12), head injury (for cervical injuries), or intrathoracic injuries and pelvic fractures (for lumbar and sacral injuries). Conclusions Most spinal CT examinations for the diagnosis of spinal injuries in children did not show positive findings. Thus, many children were exposed to an unnecessary high dose of radiation. New clinical evaluation criteria and indicators should be defined to diagnose spinal injuries and avoid unnecessary radiological examinations.

AB  - Background: Most studies on trauma and trauma systems have been conducted in the United States. We aimed to describe the factors predicting mortality in European trauma patients, with focus on triage. Methods: We prospectively registered all trauma patients in Eastern Denmark over 12 consecutive months. We analysed the flow of trauma patients through the system, the time spent at different locations, and we assessed the risk factors of mortality. Results: We included 2875 trauma patients, of whom 158 (5.5%) died before arrival at the hospital. Most patients (75.3%) were brought to local hospitals and patients primarily (n=82) or secondarily triaged (n=203) to the level I trauma centre were the most severely injured. Secondarily transferred patients spent a median of 150?min in the local hospital before transfer to the level I trauma centre and 48?min on transportation. Severe injury with an injury severity score >15 was seen in 345 patients, of whom 118 stayed at the local hospital. They had a significantly higher mortality than 116 of those secondarily transferred [45/118, 38.1% vs. 11/116, 9.7% (P<0.0001)]. Mortality within 30 days was 4.3% in admitted patients, and significant risk factors of death were violence [odds ratio (OR)=5.72], unconsciousness (OR=4.87), hypotension (OR=4.96), injury severity score >15 (OR=27.42), and age. Conclusions: Around 50% of all trauma deaths occurred at the scene. Increased survival of severely injured patients may be achieved by early transfer to highly specialised care.

AB  - Abstract:? Impaired declarative memory performance and smaller hippocampal volume have been observed in young and middle-aged adults with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These alterations may put trauma survivors with PTSD at greater risk for cognitive decline in later life. This article focuses on the emerging literature on neuropsychological impairment in aging trauma survivors, in particular, elderly combat veterans and survivors of the Holocaust. In veterans and in Holocaust survivors, PTSD was associated with substantial impairments in learning, free and cued recall, and recognition memory compared to the respective nonexposed subjects; however, in neither group was PTSD associated with impaired retention or ?rapid forgetting.? Additionally, PTSD was not associated with smaller right or left hippocampal volume in either cohort. PTSD is associated with considerable cognitive burden with age. Longitudinal studies of older subjects are warranted to examine whether PTSD is associated with accelerated aging or progressive memory loss.

AB  - Abstract Objective: Patient outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is highly variable. The underlying pathophysiology of this is poorly understood, but inflammation is potentially an important factor. Microglia orchestrate many aspects of this response. Their activation can be studied in vivo using the positron emission tomography (PET) ligand [11C](R)PK11195 (PK). In this study, we investigate whether an inflammatory response to TBI persists, and whether this response relates to structural brain abnormalities and cognitive function. Methods: Ten patients, studied at least 11 months after moderate to severe TBI, underwent PK PET and structural magnetic resonance imaging (including diffusion tensor imaging). PK binding potentials were calculated in and around the site of focal brain damage, and in selected distant and subcortical brain regions. Standardized neuropsychological tests were administered. Results: PK binding was significantly raised in the thalami, putamen, occipital cortices, and posterior limb of the internal capsules after TBI. There was no increase in PK binding at the original site of focal brain injury. High PK binding in the thalamus was associated with more severe cognitive impairment, although binding was not correlated with either the time since the injury or the extent of structural brain damage. Interpretation: We demonstrate that increased microglial activation can be present up to 17 years after TBI. This suggests that TBI triggers a chronic inflammatory response particularly in subcortical regions. This highlights the importance of considering the response to TBI as evolving over time and suggests interventions may be beneficial for longer intervals after trauma than previously assumed.

AB  - Abstract Background Traumatic injury can lead to dysregulation of the normal clotting system, resulting in hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications. Platelet activation is robust following traumatic injury and one process of platelet activation is to release of extracellular vesicles (PEV) that carry heterogenous cargo loads and surface ligands. Objectives We sought to investigate and characterize the release and function of PEVs generated following traumatic injury. Methods PEV content and quantity in circulation following trauma in humans and mice was measured using flow cytometry, size exclusion chromatography, and nanoparticle tracking analysis. PEVs were isolated from circulation and the effects on thrombin generation, bleeding time, hemorrhage control, and thrombus formation were determined. Finally, the effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on PEV release and thrombosis were examined. Results Human and murine trauma results in a significant release of PEVs into circulation compared with healthy controls. These PEVs result in abundant thrombin generation, increased platelet aggregation, decreased bleeding times, and decreased hemorrhage in uncontrolled bleeding. Conversely, PEVs contributed to enhanced venous thrombus formation and were recruited to the developing thrombus site. Interestingly, HCQ treatment resulted in decreased platelet aggregation, decreased PEV release, and reduced deep vein thrombosis burden in mice. Conclusions These data demonstrate that trauma results in significant release of PEVs which are both pro-hemostatic and pro-thrombotic. The effects of PEVs can be mitigated by treatment with HCQ, suggesting the potential use as a form of deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

AB  - Abstract Background The rate of hospitalization in elderly patients because of falls is increasing. The objective of this study was to investigate long-term trends in injury profiles of low-energy falls and to identify injuries associated with need for in-patient rehabilitation. Methods A single-centre retrospective study was performed at an inner city Major Trauma Centre in Sydney. Trauma registry data were obtained from patients who were 65 years of age or over with low-energy falls (trip and fall from height ≤1?m, including falls from standing) from the trauma registry between January 2000 and December 2011. Demographic data, time and date of presentation and injury characteristics were collected. Outcomes of interests were proportions of hip fractures, head injuries and discharge to in-patient rehabilitation facilities. Results A total of 4964 cases were identified. There was a 6.5% per annum decrease in the proportion of elderly patients with low-energy falls who sustained hip fractures compared with a relative increase in severe head injuries, 5.7% per annum. Around 25% of patients were transferred to in-patient rehabilitation. Severe head injuries and lower-limb injuries were the two injuries most associated with transfer to in-patient rehabilitation. Conclusion In elderly patients with low-energy falls, a significant decrease in hip fractures was associated with a rise in severe head injuries over the past decade.

AB  - Abstract Definitions of multi-impulsivity and sample characteristics between studies of impulsivity vary widely leading to inconsistent results. Outcome data was examined to assess the comparative response of multi-impulsive and non multi-impulsive bulimic patients to a supervised self-help CBT programme. Multi-impulsivity was defined as the presence of two or more impulsive behaviours in the last 2 months in addition to bulimia nervosa as reported with the Multi-Impulsivity Scale. Multi-impulsive patients reported similar levels of bulimic behaviours but higher levels of depression at pre-treatment. They achieved similar levels of change by the end of treatment. However, despite improvements, their levels of depressive symptoms remain high and bulimic symptoms subclinical and may be at higher risk of relapse.
