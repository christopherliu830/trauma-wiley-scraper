AB  - Abstract In hospitalized patients, lipid emulsions are an integral part of balanced parenteral nutrition. Traditionally, a single lipid source, soybean oil, has been given to patients and was usually regarded as just a source of energy and to prevent essential fatty-acid deficiency. However, mixtures of different lipid emulsions have now become widely available, including mixtures of soybean oil, medium-chain triglycerides, olive oil, and fish oil. Fish oil is high in the ?-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). There is a growing body of evidence that these ?-3 fatty acids can exert beneficial immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and inflammation-resolution effects across a wide range of patient groups including surgical, cancer, and critically ill patients. At least in part, these effects are realized via potent specialized pro-resolution mediators (SPMs). Moreover, parenteral nutrition including ?-3 fatty acids can result in additional clinical benefits over the use of standard lipid emulsions, such as reductions in infection rates and length of hospital and intensive care unit stay. Clinical and experimental evidence is reviewed regarding lipid emulsion use in a variety of hospitalized patient groups, including surgical, critically ill, sepsis, trauma, and acute pancreatitis patients. Practical aspects of lipid emulsion use in critically ill patients are also considered, such as how to determine and fulfill energy expenditure, how and when to consider parenteral nutrition, duration of infusion, and safety monitoring.

AB  - Understanding dentinogenesis and pulp regeneration during physiological and pathological conditions represents a real challenge in the provision of a suitable treatment that ideally leads to the induction of the pulp regenerative potential. This paper focusses on the early steps of dentin?pulp regeneration that appear to be critical after pulp capping procedures. Different models are described in this paper where the interactions between different cell types in vitro illustrate their role in maintaining pulpal homeostasis. After traumatic injuries, the cells modify the local pulpal microenvironment by secreting growth factors that orchestrate and induce the processes required for dentin?pulp regeneration. Applying dental materials onto the injured pulp modifies this local microenvironment and affects the potential for pulpal regeneration. The paper also describes the added value of developing an entire human tooth culture model for understanding these early steps and discusses the interest of its use in evaluating newly developed pulp capping materials through the example of BiodentineTM, developed as a dentin substitute. The growth factors sustained release simulating the local microenvironment is also discussed. Simulating the pulp local environment with a continuous growth factors release is also a basic requirement for establishing future pulp tissue engineering.

AB  - Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment protocols have been introduced in the intensive care unit (ICU) to avoid secondary brain injury. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the deviations from such a treatment protocol and the frequency of extracranial complications, and relate these findings to outcome. Methods During a 5-year period (2004?2009), 133 patients with severe TBI [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score?≤?8] were prospectively included. The following deviations from treatment goals were studied: intracranial pressure (ICP), blood pressure, haemoglobin, blood glucose, serum sodium, serum albumin, body temperature and extracranial complications during the ICU stay. Outcome was assessed using Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score at 12 months. Results The frequencies of deviations from the treatment goals were: episodes of intracranial hypertension 69.5% (of monitored patients), hypotension 20.3%, anaemia 77.4%, hyperglycaemia 42.9%, hyponatremia 34.6%, hypoalbuminemia 30.8% and hyperthermia 54.9%. Pulmonary complications were common (pneumonia 72.2%, acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury 31.6%). Thrombocytopenia (4.5%), severe sepsis (3.0%), renal failure (0.8%) and liver failure (0.8%) were infrequent. Twenty-six (19.5%) patients died within the first 12 months due to the head injury. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, Injury Severity Score (ISS), ICP?>?25?mmHg, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome. Conclusions Deviations from the TBI treatment protocol were frequent. Pneumonia was the most frequent extracranial complication. Age, GCS score, pupil dilation, ISS, high ICP, hyperglycaemia and pneumonia predicted a worse outcome.

AB  - Many clonal plants consist of many connected individual ramets, allowing them to share water and nutrients via physiological integration. Integration among ramets may also improve the ability of clonal plants to tolerate abiotic stress or improve the competitive ability of individual ramets. Here I use a field experiment to determine whether clonal integration improves ramet performance for a widespread clonal tree species invading into native prairie. Aspen (Populus tremuloides) dominates the southern treeline in western Canada, has long-lived belowground connections between mother and daughter ramets, and reproduces vegetatively via resprouting rhizomes after disturbance. I applied two competition treatments (neighbors present or absent) and two clonal integration treatments (belowground rhizomes between mother and daughter ramets either severed or left intact) to 12 replicate Populus daughter ramets at each of three sites. Neighbors improved the survivorship of Populus ramets by 25?35% after 2 yr, but decreased growth by ?20%. Clonal integration tended to improve ramet survival and growth, but these trends were often not significant. Clonal integration did not alter the effects of competition from neighboring vegetation, suggesting that connections between ramets do not necessarily improve the competitive ability of Populus invading into native prairie.

AB  - Although the general surgeon who takes emergency call may be confronted with a patient who has sustained a blunt liver injury, the decrease in road trauma and work-place accidents has meant that this will be an infrequent occurrence. Minimal exposure will, of necessity, extrapolate to difficulty in coping with a catastrophic event which comes unheralded, at an inconvenient time and usually when there is less than ideal support. During the past 15 years, there has been an evolution in the treatment of liver injuries which is exemplified by a non-operative approach in selected patients and more conservative procedures in those who require operative intervention. At present, ?damage control? is in vogue; do the least possible to control life-threatening injuries and come back another day. This is a cogent and admirable philosophy, provided that the pendulum does not swing too far and that a planned course of action is in place. This paper reviews the present status of managing blunt liver injuries, with an emphasis on the general surgeon who has little cause to be involved with surgery of the liver.

Pilot study efforts to meet their support needs with a novel and practical approach to dietary intake data collection are described in this brief report. Materials and Method? Still photography kits were used by nine adult volunteer participants with intellectual disabilities who lived in group homes or in semi-independent living arrangements to capture images of the food they consumed over 24?h. Results? Use of photographs during dietary intake interviews improved the reliability of the participants? responses. Mean reliability ratings improved from ?Indiscernible/Poor? (mean range 1.0?1.7) to ?Good/Excellent? (mean range 3.6?5.0). Conclusions? Our preliminary data imply that Food on Film is an effective and appropriate tool for use in community settings and warrants further testing.

AB  - Abstract A perilymphatic fistula (PLF) is an abnormal communication between the inner and middle ear resulting in vestibular or cochlear symptoms. We review three pediatric traumatic temporal bone fractures with pneumolabyrinth, confirmed radiologically by the presence of air within the cochlea (pneumocochlea) or vestibule (pneumovestibule). Patients were treated conservatively with complete resolution of vestibulopathy. Hearing outcome was variable and worse in two patients with pneumocochlea. A pneumolabyrinth on radiologic imaging confirms a PLF and obviates the need for exploration to reach a diagnosis. We suggest exploration be reserved for patients with persisting cerebrospinal fluid leakage, progressive sensorineural hearing loss, or vestibular symptomatology. Laryngoscope, 2011

AB  - Reasons for performing study Early identification of surgical cases of colic is critical to improving outcome and welfare. There have been a number of studies on diagnostic tests for colic, evaluating a range of tests to differentiate between medical and surgical cases. Objectives To systematically review and appraise the evidence on diagnostic tests for identifying surgical colic. Study design Systematic review. Methods The primary literature search was conducted in CAB Abstracts (1910?2014), WEB of Science (1950?2014) and MEDLINE (1946?2014) using search terms relating to equine colic. Publications were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria, and then reviewed using the QUADAS quality assessment tool. Results The primary search identified 5508 publications relating to equine colic; 976 related to diagnostic tests, 29 met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using the QUADAS tool. Of these, 16 papers reported on peritoneal fluid parameters, 21 on blood parameters, 10 on blood and peritoneal parameters, 3 on physical and blood parameters and one study on urine parameters. A range of different parameters were evaluated, with the majority of tests only being evaluated in single studies. None of the studies met QUADAS criteria 1 (representative spectrum of patients), 7/29 studies met criteria 2 (description of selection criteria) and 10/29 studies met criteria 9 (description of reference standard). Conclusions There are currently no published studies which use appropriate methodology to assess the accuracy of a diagnostic test in differentiating medical and surgical colic. This made direct application of the QUADAS tool challenging; predominantly due to the lack of a pre mortem ?gold standard? reference diagnostic test for colic. Very few studies enrolled a randomised selection of patients and there was also a propensity to case?control study design, both increasing the risk of bias and under/overestimating diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract The use of appropriate resuscitation targets or end-points may facilitate early detection and appropriate management of shock. There is a fine balance between oxygen delivery and consumption, and when this is perturbed, an oxygen debt is generated. In this narrative review, we explore the value of global haemodynamic resuscitation end-points, including pulse rate, blood pressure, central venous pressure and mixed/central venous oxygen saturations. The evidence supporting the reliability of these parameters as end-points for guiding resuscitation and their potential limitations are evaluated.

AB  - Abstract The aim of the study was to explore the degree (and type) of burnout and trauma symptoms, personal histories and coping strategies retrospectively reported by those who work with maltreated children and their families. A self-selected sample of workers (N = 44) completed a self-report questionnaire assessing childhood maltreatment, family background characteristics, current adjustment, coping strategies and burnout. Workers reported high levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, and a low to moderate sense of personal accomplishment. Family background characteristics predicted the occurrence of maltreatment and current adjustment, and a personal history of maltreatment predicted current trauma symptoms, but not burnout. Workers most frequently used problem-focused coping strategies and sought social support; however, coping strategies were not associated with the level of either trauma symptoms or burnout. Despite employing positive coping strategies, their efficacy may be affected by other interpersonal, intra-individual and job resource issues. Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract We address the comparison of results between two diagnostic tests applied multiple times to the same subjects. The estimand of interest is the sensitivity of the combined test (primary and adjunct) relative to a primary test. Analytical methods are first described that assume independence between the multiple observations within a subject. In order to account for the within-subject correlation introduced by the multiple measurements, analytical approaches for correlated, categorical response data are described. In the discussion of these methods, we pay particular attention to the presence of a structural zero which results from the decision rule for the combination of diagnostic tests. In a simulation study, we compare the finite sample performances of all analytical approaches in terms of confidence interval coverage rates and median lengths. Our methods are cast in the context of a diagnostic bronchoscopy technology for the detection of lung cancer. Copyright ? 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Objective In this trial, we compared the relative efficacy of dialogical exposure group treatment using Gestalt empty-chair method with a supportive group in the treatment of symptoms stemming from traumatic loss in a post-war society. Methods One-hundred and nineteen women whose husbands were either killed or registered as missing during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina were quasi-randomized to seven sessions of group treatment with dialogical exposure or to an active control condition. Results Both interventions resulted in significant improvement from baseline to post-treatment for both kinds of loss, in terms of post-traumatic symptoms, general mental health and grief reactions, with the exception of depression and traumatic grief in the control condition. Regarding mean effect sizes (Cohen's d), pre-treatment to post-treatment improvements were moderate (d?=?0.56) for the dialogical exposure group and small (d?=?0.34) for the supportive group. Treatment gains were maintained at least until the 1-year follow-up. In controlled comparisons, dialogical exposure was superior concerning traumatic grief (Cohen's d?=?0.37) and post-traumatic avoidance (d?=?0.73) at post-treatment. Conclusions Results show that short-term dialogical exposure group treatment was moderately effective in treating traumatically bereaved women. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message Research attests to high levels of symptoms among post-war civil populations, in particular, when a loved one was killed, which can lead not only to trauma reactions but also to severe separation distress. Grieving the loss of a loved one is hampered if the death remains unconfirmed. Unconfirmed loss could be conceptualized as unfinished business in terms of Gestalt therapy, which offers empty-chair dialogue for resolving unfinished business and grief. Dialogical exposure therapy (DET) supports the client in gaining awareness of and expressing his or her inner dialogues concerning the traumatic event, using Gestalt empty-chair method. Short-term DET was effective in treating traumatically bereaved women but showed little additional effects in comparison with a supportive group treatment, so further research is warranted.

AB  - Abstract One of the central considerations in the validity argument for the TOEFL iBT is the relationship between the language on the exam and the language required for university courses. Corpus linguistics has recently been shown to be an effective way to explore this relationship, which can also be considered as an aspect of authenticity. Applying Multi-Dimensional Analysis, our study is the first to directly compare the lexico-grammatical characteristics of texts produced by second language writers on a high-stakes standardized exam (the TOEFL iBT) to the characteristics of texts produced by the same writers for disciplinary writing tasks required as part of their academic career (e.g., lab reports, argumentative essays). Our findings show that the language of TOEFL iBT tasks have patterns of both similarity and difference from disciplinary tasks with respect to four linguistic dimensions of language use: (a) Compressed Procedural Information versus Stance toward the Work of Others, (b) Personal Stance, (c) Possible versus Completed Events, and (d) Information Density. Integrated iBT tasks show similarities to certain kinds of disciplinary tasks, while independent iBT tasks differ linguistically from almost all disciplinary writing tasks. These general patterns hold regardless of the score levels of test takers. We discuss the implications of these findings for language teaching and assessment.

AB  - Aim To evaluate the influence of supracondylar femoral derotation osteotomy (FDO) on hip abduction muscle force and frontal hip moments in children with bilateral cerebral palsy. Method For this retrospective cohort study 79 children (36 females, 43 males; mean age at surgery 11y [SD 3y]; range 4?17y) with bilateral cerebral palsy and preoperatively and 1-year postoperatively documented frontal hip moments who received supracondylar FDO in 134 limbs were included. The control group consisted of eight children (two females, six males; mean age 11y [SD 4y]; range 5?17y) who received single-event multi-level surgery without FDO. Results Hip joint impulse (p<0.001) and the first peak of frontal hip moments (p=0.003) increased, whereas the second peak decreased (p<0.001) from preoperatively to postoperatively. Hip abductor strength improved (p=0.001) from preoperatively to postoperatively. Interpretation Despite the compensatory mechanism, frontal hip moments are decreased preoperatively. Supracondylar FDO results in increased frontal hip moments. Changes in anteversion directly influence hip kinetics, although no direct change of the proximal bony geometry is performed. What this paper adds Internal rotation gait cannot fully restore the frontal hip moment. Supracondylar femoral derotation osteotomy (FDO) influences frontal hip kinetics in children with bilateral cerebral palsy. Supracondylar FDO changes the curve progression of frontal hip moments. Supracondylar FDO restores the hip abductor moment arm. Supracondylar FDO leads to an increase in hip abductor muscle force.

AB  - Abstract The development of math skills is a critical component of early education and a strong indicator of later school and economic success. Recent research utilizing population-normed, standardized measures of math achievement suggest that structural and functional integrity of parietal regions, especially the intraparietal sulcus, are closely related to the development of math skills. However, it is unknown how these findings relate to in-school math learning. The present study is the first to address this issue by investigating the relationship between regional differences in grey matter (GM) volume and performance in grade-level mathematics as measured by a state-wide, school-based test of math achievement (TCAP math) in children from 3rd to 8th grade. Results show that increased GM volume in the bilateral hippocampal formation and the right inferior frontal gyrus, regions associated with learning and memory, is associated with higher TCAP math scores. Secondary analyses revealed that GM volume in the left angular gyrus had a stronger relationship to TCAP math in grades 3?4 than in grades 5?8 while the relationship between GM volume in the left inferior frontal gyrus and TCAP math was stronger for grades 5?8. These results suggest that the neuroanatomical architecture related to in-school math achievement differs from that related to math achievement measured by standardized tests, and that the most related neural structures differ as a function of grade level. We suggest, therefore, that the use of school-relevant outcome measures is critical if neuroscience is to bridge the gap to education.

AB  - Purpose To implement and optimize a new approach for susceptibility-weighted image (SWI) generation from multi-echo multi-channel image data and compare its performance against optimized traditional SWI pipelines. Materials and Methods Five healthy volunteers were imaged at 7 Tesla. The inter-echo-variance (IEV) channel combination, which uses the variance of the local frequency shift at multiple echo times as a weighting factor during channel combination, was used to calculate multi-echo local phase shift maps. Linear phase masks were combined with the magnitude to generate IEV-SWI. The performance of the IEV-SWI pipeline was compared with that of two accepted SWI pipelines?channel combination followed by (i) Homodyne filtering (HPH-SWI) and (ii) unwrapping and high-pass filtering (SVD-SWI). The filtering steps of each pipeline were optimized. Contrast-to-noise ratio was used as the comparison metric. Qualitative assessment of artifact and vessel conspicuity was performed and processing time of pipelines was evaluated. Results The optimized IEV-SWI pipeline (σ?=?7?mm) resulted in continuous vessel visibility throughout the brain. IEV-SWI had significantly higher contrast compared with HPH-SWI and SVD-SWI (P?<?0.001, Friedman nonparametric test). Residual background fields and phase wraps in HPH-SWI and SVD-SWI corrupted the vessel signal and/or generated vessel-mimicking artifact. Optimized implementation of the IEV-SWI pipeline processed a six-echo 16-channel dataset in under 10?min. Conclusion IEV-SWI benefits from channel-by-channel processing of phase data and results in high contrast images with an optimal balance between contrast and background noise removal, thereby presenting evidence of importance of the order in which postprocessing techniques are applied for multi-channel SWI generation.

AB  - We measured the effects of divided attention on the aggressive behavior of a 20-year-old man within a test-control functional analysis (FA; Iwata, B. A., Duncan, B. A., Zarcone, J. R., Lerman, D. C., & Shore, B. A. (1994). A sequential, test-control methodology for conducting functional analyses of self-injurious behavior. Behavior Modification, 18, 289?306). The FA confirmed that divided attention was associated with high-frequency aggression and aggression-contingent attention from a familiar and preferred staff person. A subsequent treatment evaluation confirmed that aggression decreased when the man was able to request attention from the staff person under the divided attention condition. We discuss the clinical utility of a divided attention and test-control methodology when conducting a FA of serious problem behavior within applied settings Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the extent that acute asthma is inappropriately treated with antibiotics in Japanese emergency departments (EDs). Objectives: We examined the proportion and predictors of inappropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute asthma in the Japanese EDs. Methods: We conducted a chart review study in 23 Japanese EDs. Subjects were ED patients aged 18 to 54 years with acute asthma between 2009 and 2011. To examine predictors of inappropriate antibiotic use, we performed multi-level logistic regression analysis at both the patient- and ED-level modeling EDs as a random variable. Results: Among 1380 patients in the overall study, the analytic cohort comprised 1311 patients. Overall, antibiotics were inappropriately prescribed for 4.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.4%?5.7%). In the multi-level logistic regression analysis, higher annual ED asthma visit volume was significantly associated with a lower proportion of inappropriate antibiotic use (odds ratio per 100-visit increase, 0.3 ; 95%CI, 0.2?0.6). Conclusions: In this large multicenter study in Japan, we found that approximately 4% of ED patients with acute asthma were inappropriately treated with antibiotics. We also demonstrated that the inappropriate use of antibiotics largely differed across the EDs and was less common in EDs with a more annual ED asthma visits. Organized knowledge translation initiatives are warranted to address this gap in emergency asthma care.
