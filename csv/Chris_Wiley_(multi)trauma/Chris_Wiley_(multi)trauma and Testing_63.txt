AB  - Abstract This study examines the association between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and combat exposure with the socioeconomic status of 2210 male monozygotic veteran twin pairs in 1987. In the unadjusted analysis on individuals, modest correlations indicated that those with PTSD were more likely to have been divorced, and less likely to be currently employed or to achieve high status in income, education or occupation. In the crude analysis of veterans not suffering from PTSD, there were small positive correlations between combat level experienced and the likelihood of ever being married, ever being divorced, and the number of years employed at the current job. However, when we examined identical twins discordant for PTSD, and adjusted for pre-military and military service factors, only unemployment remained significant. Likewise, in combat-discordant twins, no significant effects on the socioeconomic indicators were seen. We conclude that PTSD and combat experience in Southeast Asia have not had a major impact on the socioeconomic status of veterans.

AB  - Abstract Craniocerebral trauma is a serious disease accompanied with mechanical damage, oxidative damage, and neuronal apoptosis. Circular RNA HIPK3 (circHIPK3), an abundant circRNA, exerts the function in promoting cell growth. Therefore, we aimed to explore the biological roles and mechanism of circHIPK3 on cell damage in craniocerebral trauma. PC-12 cells were cotransfected with PLCDH-cirHIPK3 and microRNA-455 (miR-455) inhibitor and then were treated with H2O2 for 24?hours. Cell viability, apoptosis and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) were tested through trypan blue staining, flow cytometry and reactive oxygen species assay, respectively. Expression of circHIPK3 and miR-455 were tested through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Expression of pro-PARP, cleaved-PARP, pro-caspase-3, cleaved-caspase-3, pro-caspase-9, cleaved-caspase-9, ?-actin, beclin-1, p62, light chain 3-I (LC3-I), LC3-II, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), t-extracellular-regulated kinase (t-ERK) and p-ERK were tested via Western blot experiments. The 100??M H2O2-induced cell damage presented as reducing cell viability, increasing apoptosis, autophagy, and MFI. Besides, H2O2 could downregulate circHIPK3. However, overexpression of circHIPK3 attenuated cell damage caused by H2O2 that it increased cell viability, decreased apoptosis, autophagy and MFI through upregulating miR-455. Additionally, circHIPK3 overexpression promoted the activation of Nrf2 and ERK signal pathways by upregulating miR-455. Our study demonstrated that circHIPK3 attenuated H2O2-induced cell damage and activated Nrf2 and ERK signal pathways by upregulation of miR-455.

AB  - Dry air and cold weather have been shown to influence skin irritability. We have recently proposed a routine irritant patch test to assess skin irritability in a standardised fashion in occupational dermatology. The effects of local meteorological parameters on this test were studied. In 556 consecutive persons (276 female [median age: 36], 280 male [median age: 42]) with former occupational skin disease, who were seen for medico-legal evaluation from Feb. 2000 to Aug. 2003, a swift modified alkaline resistance test (SMART) was conducted simultaneously in the volar forearm and the dorsum of the hand. The test comprises a 0.5?M NaOH-challenge for 2???10 minutes with intermediate TEWL-measurements and a clinical assessment with an NaCl 0.9% control site. TEWL was measured according to current guidelines. The outcome of each patient was related to standardised data on the local temperature [T] and absolute humidity [aH] on the day of examination, obtained by the German Meteorological Service. There was no relevant correlation between ?basal TEWL? or ?TEWL after NaOH? and ?aH? or ?T?, respectively. There was no association between meteorological conditions and demographic characteristics potentially relevant for susceptibility to irritants and, hence, no indication of confounding. In a logistic regression model increasing ?aH?(OR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.87?0.96 per 1?mg/l humidity) and ?T?(OR 0.94, 95% CI: 0.81?0.97 per °?C) were associated with a decreasing likelihood of a clinically positive reaction to irritation. Although there are only slight seasonal effects detectable, they should be taken into consideration when interpreting the test.

AB  - Objectives The current study examined whether various types of rumination are distinguishable and the effects of personal growth initiative (PGI) on posttraumatic growth, posttraumatic stress, and depression through adaptive and maladaptive rumination. Method Sample included 292 college students who experienced a potentially traumatic event (PTE). Results Intrusive and deliberative rumination were found to be distinct factors. However, brooding and reflection, thought to be separate aspects of depression, were a single factor. PGI was positively associated with growth and negatively associated with depression for both genders, and a negative relationship was found between PGI and posttraumatic stress among women. Indirect effects of PGI were found on posttraumatic stress and growth through different forms of rumination. These relations did not change after including the covariates (i.e., time since the trauma, direct exposure, and intentional harm). Conclusion The study provides new insight integrating rumination from the depression literature in the context of trauma and a potential benefit in applying PGI in alleviating pathology after a PTE and facilitating growth.

AB  - Introduction Eventing is a challenging equestrian discipline. Insight into causes of wastage and withdrawal from competition is essential for animal welfare and economic reasons. Methods Twenty-nine animals selected for the European Championship (EC) in 2010 (9 ponies) and 2011 (20 horses) were followed prospectively monitoring fitness using standardized exercise tests. Causes of withdrawal were noted. Data were analyzed using logistic-regression, likely-ratio-tests, Fisher-exact-test, general-linear-model and Chi-square tests as appropriate. Results Seventeen weeks before EC 17 horses and 9 ponies were tested: mean VLa4 was 10.3?±?0.4?m/s and 7.8?±?0.9?m/s respectively, and V200 was 11.4?±?0.8?m/s and 9.6?±?0.7?m/s respectively. Six weeks before EC 16/20 horses and 6/9 ponies were withdrawn, mainly for locomotor injury: 9/16 horses (P<0.001), 4/6 ponies (P?=?0.011). Other reasons were ?not-meeting-competition-criteria? (4/16 horses, 2/6 ponies) and ?being sold? (3/16 horses). Divided on the basis of VLa4 and ?recovery-HR-during-SET-I? into good (GP) and average performers (AP), AP were more likely to be injured (50%) than GP (0%, P?=?0.05). In a subpopulation (n?=?10, all condition training sessions evaluated for HR and speed) HRpeak was significantly lower in horses staying sound (186?±?9 beats/min) compared to horses withdrawn because of injury (201?±?5 beats/min; P?=?0.016). Conclusions For the European Championship 45% of national selection horses were unavailable because of locomotor injuries. GP at the beginning of the season were less likely to become injured than AP. HRpeak during condition training showed predictive value for future injuries. Ethical Animal Research Owners gave consent for horses to participate in the study. Sources of funding:?Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Dutch National Equestrian Federation. Competing interests:?none.

AB  - Abstract Background There is a critical need for evidence-based health education interventions for women with intellectual disabilities (IDs) to promote receipt of preventive health screenings. Previous research has established Women Be Healthy, an 8-week classroom-style intervention designed to teach women with IDs about breast and cervical cancer screenings, as a promising practice. However, additional research is needed to determine how to further improve screening-related knowledge gains. This study aimed to test a modified version of Women Be Healthy, Women Be Healthy 2, and compare its effectiveness in increasing knowledge gains to the original intervention. Method Women living in the community across one state in the United States were randomly assigned to a treatment (n?=?98), delayed treatment, (n?=?35), or no intervention group (n?=?65). Women in the treatment group received Women Be Healthy, and women in the delayed treatment group received the modified Women Be Healthy 2. Baseline and post-intervention interviews were conducted to measure knowledge of cervical and breast cancer screening. Knowledge scores were compared across groups. Results Among the nine knowledge items measured, one breast knowledge measure and one cervical knowledge measure showed statistically significant group differences; marginally significant differences were observed for two other knowledge measures. After adjusting for covariates, women who received Women Be Healthy 2 had increased knowledge overall compared with the women receiving no intervention. Conclusion Women Be Healthy 2 is promising, but additional efforts appear necessary to increase the knowledge women with IDs have about cervical and breast cancer screening.

AB  - ABSTRACT Many large GWAS consortia are expanding to simultaneously examine the joint role of DNA methylation in addition to genotype in the same subjects. However, integrating information from both data types is challenging. In this paper, we propose a composite kernel machine regression model to test the joint epigenetic and genetic effect. Our approach works at the gene level, which allows for a common unit of analysis across different data types. The model compares the pairwise similarities in the phenotype to the pairwise similarities in the genotype and methylation values; and high correspondence is suggestive of association. A composite kernel is constructed to measure the similarities in the genotype and methylation values between pairs of samples. We demonstrate through simulations and real data applications that the proposed approach can correctly control type I error, and is more robust and powerful than using only the genotype or methylation data in detecting trait-associated genes. We applied our method to investigate the genetic and epigenetic regulation of gene expression in response to stressful life events using data that are collected from the Grady Trauma Project. Within the kernel machine testing framework, our methods allow for heterogeneity in effect sizes, nonlinear, and interactive effects, as well as rapid P-value computation.

AB  - Objectives: We devised a method of irradiating a fresh traumatic tattoo with long pulse alexandrite laser in conjunction with the use of a dynamic cooling device (DCD) to minimize the injury of the epidermal layer before the occurrence of pigmentation in the deep layer of the skin, when the wound is not completely epithelialized. Methods: A 4-year-old girl suffered a burn injury and deposition of fuel residues in a diameter of 5?cm on the left cheek by backfire of a motorcycle muffler. The patient was treated with an ointment at a hospital for about 10 days, and then referred to our hospital. On initial visit, removal of foreign bodies was attempted by brushing but with little success. Accordingly, long pulse alexandrite laser treatment was performed four times in total at intervals of about one week. On the initial irradiation DCD was not used, but was used on all subsequent treatments thereafter for the protection of the epidermal layer. Results: Since remarkable pigment reduction was observed after the laser irradiation, the treatment was stopped. Follow-up was performed while the lesion was shielded from light. Conclusion: Since the long pulse alexandrite laser with the DCD conveniently enables continuous irradiation of pigments in a short time while minimizing damage to the epidermis, its therapeutic effect can be expected. However, great care is needed during the treatment to prevent scarring.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant health issue that often causes enduring cognitive deficits, in particular memory dysfunction. The hippocampus, a structure crucial in learning and memory, is frequently damaged during TBI. Since long-term potentiation (LTP) is the leading cellular model underlying learning and memory, this study was undertaken to examine how injury affects area CA1 LTP in mice using lateral fluid percussion injury (FPI). Brain slices derived from FPI animals demonstrated an inability to induce LTP in area CA1 7 days postinjury. However, area CA1 long-term depression could be induced in neurons 7 days postinjury, demonstrating that some forms of synaptic plasticity can still be elicited. Using a multidisciplined approach, potential mechanisms underlying the inability to induce and maintain area CA1 LTP were investigated. This study demonstrates that injury leads to significantly smaller N-methyl-D-aspartate potentials and glutamate-induced excitatory currents, increased dendritic spine size, and decreased expression of α-calcium calmodulin kinase II. These findings may underlie the injury-induced lack of LTP and thus, contribute to cognitive impairments often associated with TBI. Furthermore, these results provide attractive sites for potential therapeutic intervention directed toward alleviating the devastating consequences of human TBI. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

All participants were free from known conditions which may have given misleading results from cortisol assay. Of nine participants who showed symptoms possibly indicating depression the DST results concurred in two cases (i.e. there were two true-positives). However there were four or five (depending on criteria adopted) false-positive DST results. There did not appear to be a consistent behavioural profile for positive DST responders. With sensitivity to possible depression estimated at 22%, and a diagnostic confidence of <35%, these data do not support recommendations that the DST is useful for assisting in diagnosis of depression in this population.

Methods An anonymous survey of all ACEM Fellows (FACEMs) listed on the ACEM researcher database was conducted between January and March 2013. Results Of 108 FACEMs invited to participate, 54 (50%) responded. Over half of respondents (61%) had a higher research degree but only a minority (24%) had funded research positions. The top research categories identified as priorities were resuscitation, trauma, cardiology, ED ultrasound, acute behavioural disturbance and geriatrics. The most common specific sub-categories included anterior chest pain, fluid resuscitation in trauma, and drug therapy for both atrial fibrillation and acute behavioural disturbance. Several specific research questions related to chest pain, resuscitation/sepsis, stroke, paediatrics and pulmonary embolus. Conclusion The findings provide guidance and support for research areas amenable to collaborative multicentre clinical research within emergency medicine. Discussion rounds are planned to translate these perceived research priorities to actual priorities.

AB  - Abstract Cell viability is crucial for effective cell-based cartilage repair. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of handling the membrane during matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation surgery on the viability of implanted chondrocytes. Images were acquired under five conditions: (i) Pre-operative; (ii) Handled during surgery; (iii) Cut edge; (iv) Thumb pressure applied; (v) Heavily grasped with forceps. Live and dead cell stains were used. Images were obtained for cell counting and morphology. Mean cell density was 6.60???105 cells/cm2 (5.74?7.11???105) in specimens that did not have significant trauma decreasing significantly in specimens that had been grasped with forceps (p?<?0.001) or cut (p?=?0.004). Cell viability on delivery grade membrane was 75.1%(72.4?77.8%). This dropped to 67.4%(64.1?69.7%) after handling (p?=?0.002), 56.3%(51.5?61.6%) after being thumbed (p?<?0.001) and 28.8%(24.7?31.2%) after crushing with forceps (p?<?0.001). When cut with scissors there was a band of cell death approximately 275?µm in width where cell viability decreased to 13.7%(10.2?18.2%, p?<?0.001). Higher magnification revealed cells without the typical rounded appearance of chondrocytes. We found that confocal laser-scanning microscope (CLSM) can be used to quantify and image the fine morphology of cells on a matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) membrane. Careful handling of the membrane is essential to minimise chondrocyte death during surgery. ? 2014 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Orthop Res 32:1495?1502, 2014.

AB  - ABSTRACT This study evaluates trepanations from five well-contextualized prehistoric sites in the south-central highlands of Andahuaylas, Peru. The emergence of trepanation in this region coincides with the collapse of the Wari Empire, ca. ad 1000. Thirty-two individuals from Andahuaylas, AMS radiocarbon dated to the early Late Intermediate Period (ca. ad 1000?1250), were found to have 45 total trepanations. Various surgical techniques were being employed concurrently throughout the region. Scraping trepanations evinced the highest survival rate; circular grooving, drilling and boring, and linear cutting were far less successful. Evidence of perioperative procedures like hair shaving, poultice application, and possible cranioplasty use aimed to ensure the survival of a trepanation recipient. Postmortem trepanations, also present in Andahuaylas, were likely executed on corpses as a means of better understanding cranial anatomy and improving techniques. Similarities in trepanation patterns throughout the region attest to common motivations to engage in surgery. Although moderate physical head trauma seems to be the impetus for intervention in many cases of trepanation, other motivations included physiological and possibly psychosomatic factors. Nevertheless, treatment was not for everyone. In Andahuaylas, trepanations were withheld from subadults, females, and those individuals who practiced cranial modification.

AB  - ABSTRACT Educational measurement is undergoing a revolution, due to the rapid dissemination of information-processing technology. One of the most notable aspects of that revolution is the rapidity with which it has come upon us. It is perhaps inevitable that the recent growth in power and sophistication of computing resources and the widespread dissemination of computers in daily life have brought about irreversible changes in educational measurement. Recent developments in computerized measurement are summarized by placing them in a four-generation framework, in which each generation represents a genus of increasing sophistication and power.

AB  - ABSTRACT This study was carried out to determine the time and concentration profile required to achieve vancomycin-mediated eradication of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm. This information is critical for the identification of performance targets for local antibiotic delivery vehicles that target biofilm infections. S. aureus UAMS-1 biofilms were grown for 7 days on titanium?aluminium?niobium discs in Mueller Hinton broth. After 7 days, the discs were then incubated in Mueller Hinton broth containing vancomycin at concentrations of 100, 200, 500, 1,000, and 2,000?mg/L. Biofilm eradication was assessed under both static and shaking conditions. Samples were retrieved at regular intervals for up to 28 days for quantification of residual biofilm. One additional disc was processed per time point for scanning electron microscopy. Progressive and significant reduction of viable bacteria was observed over time at all concentrations compared to unexposed controls. After 28 days under static conditions, the S. aureus biofilm was completely eradicated at 200?mg/L vancomycin and higher concentrations, but not at 100?mg/L. In contrast, bacterial biofilm could not be eradicated under shaking conditions at any concentration. Clinical significance: The present study shows that it is possible to eradicate mature S. aureus biofilm from metal implants by vancomycin alone although the time concentration profile required cannot be achieved by systemic administration or any of the local delivery vehicles currently available. Identifying targets for antibiotic delivery is the first step in developing fit for purpose local antibiotic delivery vehicles that will successfully and predictably treat established biofilm infection. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Progesterone (P4) has the potential therapeutic effects for traumatic brain injury (TBI) whose recovery depended on the enhanced angiogenesis. Endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) plays an essential role in vascular biology. We previously demonstrated that P4 administration improved circulating EPC level and neurological recovery of rat with TBI. Here, we hypothesized that P4 augmented angiogenic potential of EPC and the angiogenesis-related neurorestoration after TBI through classical progesterone receptor (PR). Materials and methods EPC derived from rats were stimulated with graded concentrations (0, 10?10, 10?9, 5 ? 10?9, 10?8, 10?7 mol/L) of P4 or 10?6 mol/L ulipristal acetate (UPA, a PR antagonist). Male rats were subjected to cortical impact injury and treated with (i) DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), (ii) P4 and (iii) P4 and UPA. Results It showed that P4 improved the angiogenic potential of EPC, including tube formation, adhesion, migration and vascular endothelial growth factor secretion, in a dose-dependent fashion with the maximal effect achieved at 10?9 mol/L P4. High concentration (10?7 mol/L) of P4 impaired the angiogenic potential of EPC. Notably, 10?6 mol/L UPA antagonized the stimulatory effects of 10?9 mol/L P4. After administrating P4, a significant improvement of neurological function and the restoration of the leaked blood-brain barrier were observed as well as a reduction of the brain water content. Both vessel density and expression of occludin of vessels were increased. When UPA was administered with P4, the neural restoration and angiogenesis were all reversed. Western blot showed that 10?9 mol/L P4 increased the content of PRA and PRB of EPC, while 10?7 mol/L P4 reduced the content of both PR isoforms, but there was no change found in the TBI rats. Conclusions It may suggest that P4-mediated angiogenic activity of EPC and angiogenesis in TBI rats were antagonized by PR antagonist.

AB  - Aim In certain cases, a patient's anxiety, fear, or misconceptions can represent significant obstacles to the learning of Clean Intermittent Self Catheterization (CISC), and little is known about these psychological barriers. The aim of the present study is thus to construct and validate an ?Intermittent Catheterization Acceptance Test (I-CAT)? to evaluate the psychological acceptance of CISC. Methods A study was carried out in nine neuro-rehabilitation and urology departments in French university hospitals. Fifty-five items were identified, following a comprehensive review of the literature and cognitive debriefing interviews with patients. Following an initial expert panel meeting (EPM) with a French-speaking neuro-urology study group (GENULF), this list was refined and reduced to a draft I-CAT comprising 34 items. The face validity of the draft I-CAT was determined, and the results were then analyzed in a second EPM, leading to the elaboration of a second version of the I-CAT (23 items, 5 dimensions). Psychometric validation of this second version was established from a longitudinal, non-randomized study involving 201 neurological and non-neurological patients. Linguistic validation was carried out in English. Results Following the construct validity analyses, several items were deleted due to item overlap, ceiling effects, or poor content validity and 14 items were retained. Confirmatory factor analysis shows that this version has 2 dimensions. Cronbach's alpha was 0.93. The ICC demonstrated good test-retest reliability and satisfactory responsiveness. Conclusion The upstream identification and solving of potential psychological barriers prior to the learning of CISC could improve patients? acceptance of this procedure.
