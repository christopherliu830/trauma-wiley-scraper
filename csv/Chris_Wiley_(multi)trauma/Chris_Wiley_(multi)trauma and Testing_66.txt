AB  - Abstract Objective: The prospective study compares, in split-mouth design, the use of two different suture materials, silk vs. Teflon-coated, multi-filament braided polyester threads suture. Material and methods: Ten edentulous or partially edentulous patients were surgically treated for implant installation. Each side was sutured with either, randomly selected one or the other suture material. Seven days postsurgically, the sutures were removed and three knots per patient and side were collected for microbiological testing. Additionally, a piece of each suture thread was analysed before clinical use to test its susceptibility for bacterial adherence. To evaluate the patient's subjective opinion, a questionnaire based on Visual Analogue Scale had to be filled out by all included patients 1 week after the intervention. Results: The results showed a more pronounced plaque accumulation for silk sutures but there was not a statistical difference. The intraoperative handling of the silk sutures was less comfortable and the patient comfort was worse than Teflon-coated polyester suture. Conclusion: The bacterial adherence on Teflon-coated polyester suture was slightly inferior than silk suture although it did not show the expected differences.

AB  - Summary Intranasal meningoencephaloceles are characterised by protrusion of brain and meninges through a skull-base defect. Nasal intubation or instrumentation may lead to complications such as meningoencephalitis and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhoea or fistula formation. A 62 year old lady developed rhinorrhea following failed videolaryngoscopic and nasal fibreoptic intubation, which ultimately necessitated emergency surgical tracheostomy for a ?can't intubation can't ventilate? scenario. This case highlights the diagnosis and management of an unusual complication resulting from difficult airway management.

AB  - Recent findings suggest that extracellular ubiquitin has pleiotropic effects on host defence mechanisms, but its cellular mechanism of action is not yet understood. Using fluorescence and in vivo confocal microscopy, we observed uptake of N-terminal fluorescein-labelled ubiquitin into human PBMC and MonoMac 6 cells. Immunoblotting experiments indicated that extracellular ubiquitin is then rapidly conjugated to a multitude of intracellular proteins. LPS and lipoteichoic acid significantly increased uptake and subsequent conjugation to intracellular proteins dose dependently. This mechanism showed saturation kinetics with a K d value for ubiquitin in the low nanomolar range (<10 nmol/L) and a B max value of 0.14?0.27 ?mol ubiquitin/mg protein. These results suggest that the monocytic ubiquitin system can be targeted with physiologically relevant concentrations of extracellular ubiquitin during inflammation. This concept could provide a simple explanation for a multitude of extracellular ubiquitin's actions and open up new strategies to influence ubiquitin-dependent intracellular processes.

AB  - Abstract Background: We present recommendations for revision of the diagnostic criteria for the Dissociative Disorders (DDs) for DSM-5. The periodic revision of the DSM provides an opportunity to revisit the assumptions underlying specific diagnoses and the empirical support, or lack of it, for the defining diagnostic criteria. Methods: This paper reviews clinical, phenomenological, epidemiological, cultural, and neurobiological data related to the DDs in order to generate an up-to-date, evidence-based set of DD diagnoses and diagnostic criteria for DSM-5. First, we review the definitions of dissociation and the differences between the definitions of dissociation and conceptualization of DDs in the DSM-IV-TR and the ICD-10, respectively. Also, we review more general conceptual issues in defining dissociation and dissociative disorders. Based on this review, we propose a revised definition of dissociation for DSM-5 and discuss the implications of this definition for understanding dissociative symptoms and disorders. Results: We make the following recommendations for DSM-5: 1. Depersonalization Disorder (DPD) should include derealization symptoms as well. 2. Dissociative Fugue should become a subtype of Dissociative Amnesia (DA). 3. The diagnostic criteria for DID should be changed to emphasize the disruptive nature of the dissociation and amnesia for everyday as well as traumatic events. The experience of possession should be included in the definition of identity disruption. 4. Dissociative Trance Disorder should be included in the Unspecified Dissociative Disorder (UDD) category. Conclusions: There is a growing body of evidence linking the dissociative disorders to a trauma history, and to specific neural mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To assess outcome of phacoemulsification in cats. Methods Records of 71 cats (82 eyes) from five referral centers were reviewed. Groups were divided by cause of cataract (congenital/juvenile [n = 32], traumatic [n = 33], and secondary to uveitis [n = 6]), and group comparisons were performed for the most common complications: postoperative ocular hypertension (POH), uveitis, corneal ulceration, synechia/dyscoria, and posterior capsular opacity (PCO) in three different time periods: immediately postoperatively, at 1-90 days, and at >90 days. Results Median follow-up was 198 days (interquartile range 64-518 days). The overall visual success rate of the cats with a 12-month follow-up was 92.6% (25/27 eyes). POH occurred in 35/82 (42.6%) eyes. Immediately postoperatively, uveitis was the most common complication in 28/82 eyes (34.1%) followed by corneal ulceration in 22/82 eyes (26.8%). At 1-90 days, uveitis in 41/81 eyes (50.6%) remained the most common complication, followed by synechia/dyscoria in 21/81 eyes (25.9%), corneal ulceration in 16/81 eyes (19.7%), and PCO in 15/81 eyes (18.5%). At >90 days, PCO in 17/47 eyes (36.1%), followed by synechia/dyscoria in 16/47 eyes (34%), was the most common complications. The number of eyes with synechia/dyscoria in the trauma group was higher (13/33 [39.3%]) than in the congenital/juvenile group (5/31 [16.1%]) at 1-90 days (P = .039). No statistical difference was found for the other group comparisons. Three eyes in total were enucleated owing to endophthalmitis, post-traumatic ocular sarcoma, and secondary glaucoma. Conclusion Uveitis in the short-term and PCO and synechia/dyscoria in the long-term were the most common complications following phacoemulsification in cats.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes the features of dissociative schizophrenia and the clinical model and research data supporting its existence. In classical dissociative identity disorder (DID), the characteristic symptoms are due to full switches of executive control between highly structured, personified, and discrete ego states, or alter personalities. Typically, even in DID, much of the personality system is often structured and functions at the level of Other Specified Dissociative Disorder (OSDD). Dissociative schizophrenia fits into broader conception of dissociative disorders, as do the Schneiderian first-rank symptoms of schizophrenia. The clinical implications of dissociative schizophrenia are the following: dissociative symptoms are common in schizophrenia and must be considered in treatment, some cases of schizophrenia may be treatable with psychotherapy, the environment can be the major aetiological factor in many cases of schizophrenia, and psychological trauma is a major theme in schizophrenia.

AB  - Early prerferential looking methods for the assessment of infant visual acuity relied upon formal psychophysical procedures that were lengthy and only easily applicable to laboratory studies. Two clinically appropriate techniques evaluted in this study both maintain a forced-choice testing protocol and are administered by a single examiner. One method employs a specially constructed optical projection system to present gratings in a dark-room. The second method relies upon a relies upon a commercially available acuity card test, used with good room lighting. Paediatric clinical patients and normal infants and young children were examined using both techniques. Findings demonstrate that suitably adapted preferential looking methods can provide rapid and valid estimates of visual acuity in infants and young children. The tests appear sufficiently robust to be appropriate for routine clinical use.

AB  - Abstract Appropriate deliberate clinical inertia refers to the art of doing nothing as a positive clinical response. It includes shared decision-making to improve patient care with the use of clinical judgement. We discuss common clinical scenarios where the use of deliberate clinical inertia can occur. The insertion of peripheral intravenous cannulae, investigating patients with suspected renal colic and the investigation of low risk chest pain are all opportunities for the thoughtful clinician to ?stand there? and use effective patient communication to avoid low value tests and procedures. Awareness is key to identifying these opportunities to practice deliberate clinical inertia, as many of the situations may be so much a part of our environment that they are hidden in plain view.

AB  - Aims This study investigates the influence of intensive care unit nurses? knowledge sharing behaviour on nurse innovation, given different conditions of care quality control. Background Health-care organisations face an increasing pressure to innovate while controlling care quality. We have little insight on how the control of care quality interacts with the knowledge sharing behaviour of intensive care nurses to affect their innovative behaviours. Methods We developed a multi-source survey study of more than 200 intensive care nurses at 22 intensive care units of 17 Danish hospitals. Two versions of the questionnaire were used ? one designed for nurse employees and the other for the managing nurse(s). An ordinary least squares regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. Results Different aspects of knowledge sharing affect innovation differently, depending on the strength of the control of care quality within the unit. Conclusions The increasing pressures to implement the control of care quality and innovate may be conflicting, unless handled properly. Implications for nursing management Process control at intensive care units should be loosened, when personal interaction between intensive care nurses is encouraged to stimulate nurse innovations. Alternatively, managers may develop a climate where helping others, especially with younger colleagues, offsets the negative effects of strong process control.

AB  - Summary Massive haemorrhage is a life-threatening emergency affecting many patient groups. 5?30% of critically ill patients with major blood loss have an accompanying coagulopathy, and this confers a poor prognosis. Successful treatment of severe bleeding is dependent upon many factors, including early identification of any at-risk patient, recognition and treatment of any accompanying coagulopathy, and the proactive delivery of red blood cells (RBC), to maintain tissue oxygenation, and blood components (FFP, platelets), to target the coagulopathy. This chapter will summarize the general haemostatic changes that occur during major blood loss and detail how this information has helped to drive recent changes to transfusion practices. It will focus on the general management of major blood loss and discuss how this may vary according to the different clinical settings.

AB  - Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a method that uses the intrinsic nature of local magnetic fields to enhance image contrast in order to improve the visibility of various susceptibility sources and to facilitate diagnostic interpretation. It is also the precursor to the concept of the use of phase for quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Nowadays, SWI has become a widely used clinical tool to image deoxyhemoglobin in veins, iron deposition in the brain, hemorrhages, microbleeds and calcification. In this article, we review the basics of SWI, including data acquisition, data reconstruction and post-processing. In particular, the source of cusp artifacts in phase images is investigated in detail and an improved multi-channel phase data combination algorithm is provided. In addition, we show a few clinical applications of SWI for the imaging of stroke, traumatic brain injury, carotid vessel wall, siderotic nodules in cirrhotic liver, prostate cancer, prostatic calcification, spinal cord injury and intervertebral disc degeneration. As the clinical applications of SWI continue to expand both in and outside the brain, the improvement of SWI in conjunction with QSM is an important future direction of this technology.

AB  - Background: The aims of the present multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial were: 1) to compare the efficacy of the simplified papilla preservation flap with and without a barrier membrane in deep intrabony defects; 2) to evaluate the postoperative morbidity and surgical complications; and 3) to preliminarily test the impact of baseline tooth mobility on clinical outcomes. Methods: This parallel group, randomized, multi-center, controlled clinical trial involved 112 patients in 8 periodontal practices in 4 countries. A deep intrabony defect in each patient was accessed with the simplified papilla preservation flap. In the test defects, a bioabsorbable membrane was positioned. Patients' experiences with the surgical procedure and postoperative period were evaluated with a questionnaire. Clinical outcomes included clinical attachment level (CAL) and probing depth (PD) changes. Results: Complete observations were available for 55 test and 54 control defects. CAL gains at 1 year were 3.5 ± 2.1 mm in the guided tissue regeneration (GTR) group and 2.6 ± 1.8 mm in the control group (P = 0.0117). CAL gains ≥4 mm were observed in 50.9% of GTR sites and 33.3% of control sites. A signifi-cant center effect of 2.1 mm was observed (P = 0.01). Initial PD (P = 0.01) and baseline tooth mobility (P = 0.036) were significant covariates. During the procedure, 30.4% of test and 28.6% of controls reported feeling moderate pain, and subjects estimated the hardship of the procedure at 24 ± 25 visual analog scale (VAS) units in the test group, and at 22 ± 23 VAS in controls. In terms of the investigated outcomes, differences between test and control groups were not statistically significant. Among the postoperative complications, edema was most prevalent at week 1, and more frequently associated with the test treatment (P = 0.01). In the test group, 53.6% of membranes were exposed at week 3. Conclusions: The present study further supports the added benefits of guided tissue regeneration with respect to access flap alone in the treatment of deep intrabony defects, as well as the general efficacy of GTR in different clinical settings. Furthermore, our study indicates a possible influence of baseline tooth mobility on clinical outcomes. J Periodontol 2001;72:1702-1712.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on acute occupational trauma in agriculture resulting from a wound or immediate damage by sudden one-time application of external force. It provides a general description of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries in agriculture and discusses the unique attributes of farm and agriculturally related trauma. Furthermore, the chapter provides: injury statistics and epidemiological data, rescue and medical treatment considerations, and illustrative injury descriptions. It helps to provide an understanding of how agricultural injuries occur and assisting in anticipating medical implications and prevention opportunities. The injury scenarios given in the chapter should enhance understanding of agents, events, causes, treatment, prevention, and rehabilitation of acute traumatic injuries. These scenarios are augmented with special considerations for those who are first on the scene, first responders and rescue personnel, emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and transport personnel, emergency medical treatment providers, primary care providers, secondary/tertiary care providers, and providers of rehabilitation services.

AB  - Abstract This chapter articulates how research concerning brain development and brain trauma can help practitioners engage individuals in forensic work. A range of factors are important in shaping the structure and functioning of the brain -these include biological factors, genetics, and hormones. The chapter focuses on the practical ideas to help practitioners work with individuals who have been affected by neurological damage. Problems resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) or substance misuse can also occur later in life and affect brain development. The chapter argues that treatment approaches with forensic populations should be informed by an understanding of how neurological problems can arise and affect cognitive functioning. It describes some of the deficits that are common within our client group, and consider the ramifications for treatment. The chapter provides a practical resource using accessible language, which will help practitioners work with forensic clients.

AB  - Abstract Scaffolds play a key role in the field of tissue engineering. Particularly for meniscus replacement, optimal scaffold properties are critical. The aim of our study was to develop a novel scaffold for replacement of meniscal tissue by means of tissue engineering. Emphasis was put on biomechanical properties comparable to native meniscus, nonimmunogenecity, and the possibility of seeding cells into and cultivating them within the scaffold (nontoxicity). For this purpose, native ovine menisci were treated in vitro in a self-developed enzymatic process. Complete cell removal was achieved and shown both histologically and electron microscopically (n?=?15). Immunohistochemical reaction (MHC 1/MHC 2) was positive for native ovine meniscus and negative for the scaffold. Compared to native meniscus (25.8 N/mm) stiffness of the scaffold was significantly increased (30.2 N/mm, p?<?0.05, n?=?10). We determined the compression (%) of the native meniscus and the scaffold under a load of 7 N. The compression was 23% for native meniscus and 29% for the scaffold (p?<?0.05, n?=?10). Residual force of the scaffold was significantly lower (5.2 N vs. 4.9 N, p?<?0.05, n?=?10). Autologous fibrochondrocytes were needle injected and successfully cultivated within the scaffolds over a period of 4 weeks (n?=?10). To our knowledge, this study is the first to remove cells and immunogenetic proteins (MHC 1/MHC 2) completely out of native meniscus and preserve important biomechanical properties. Also, injected cells could be successfully cultivated within the scaffold. Further in vitro and in vivo animal studies are necessary to establish optimal cell sources, sterilization, and seeding techniques. Cell differentiation, matrix production, in vivo remodeling of the construct, and possible immunological reactions after implantation are subject of further studies. ? 2007 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Aims and objectives To investigate uptake of a Chest Injury Protocol (ChIP), examine factors influencing its implementation and identify interventions for promoting its use. Background Failure to treat blunt chest injuries in a timely manner with sufficient analgesia, physiotherapy and respiratory support, can lead to complications such as pneumonia and respiratory failure and/or death. Design This is a mixed-methods implementation evaluation study. Methods Two methods were used: (i) identification and review of the characteristics of all patients eligible for the ChIP protocol, and (ii) survey of hospital staff opinions mapped to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation. The characteristics and treatment received between the groups were compared using the chi-square test or Fischer's exact test for proportions, and the Mann?Whitney U-test for continuous data. Quantitative survey data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were coded in NVivo 10 using a coding guide based on the TDF and Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW). Identification of interventions to change target behaviours was sourced from the Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy Version 1 in consultation with stakeholders. Results Only 68.4% of eligible patients received ChIP. Fifteen facilitators and 10 barriers were identified to influence the implementation of ChIP in the clinical setting. These themes were mapped to 10 of the 14 TDF domains and corresponded with all nine intervention functions in the BCW. Seven of these intervention functions were selected to address the target behaviours and a multi-faceted relaunch of the revised protocol developed. Following re-launch, uptake increased to 91%. Conclusions This study demonstrated how the BCW may be used to revise and improve a clinical protocol in the ED context. Relevance to clinical practice Newly implemented clinical protocols should incorporate clinician behaviour change assessment, strategy and interventions. Enhancing the self-efficacy of emergency nurses when performing assessments has the potential to improve patient outcomes and should be included in implementation strategy.

AB  - Abstract Clinicians are charged with the significant task of distinguishing between accidental and inflicted head trauma. Oftentimes this distinction is straightforward, but many times probabilities of injuries from accidental scenarios are unknown making the differential diagnosis difficult. For example, it is unknown whether intracranial hemorrhage (IH) can occur at a location other than a focal contact site following a low height fall. To create a foundation for predicting regional IH in infants, we sought to identify the biomechanical response and injury threshold best able to predict IH in 3?5 day old piglets. First, finite element (FE) model simulations of in situ animal studies were performed to ascertain the optimal representation of the pia-arachnoid complex, cerebrospinal fluid and cortical vasculature (PCC) for predicting brain strain and brain/skull displacement. Second, rapid head rotations resulting in various degrees of IH were simulated (n = 24) to determine the biomechanical predictor and injury threshold most closely correlated with IH. FE models representing the PCC with either spring connectors or solid elements between the brain and skull resulted in peak brain strain and brain/skull displacement similar to measured values in situ. However, when predicting IH, the spring connector representation of the PCC had the best predictive capability for IH with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 85% when ≥1% of all spring connectors had at least a peak strain of 0.31 mm/mm. These findings and reported methodology will be used in the development of a human infant FE model to simulate real-world falls and identify injury thresholds for predicting IH in infants.

AB  - A case of central nervous system protothecosis in a dog is reported. A three-year-old male Maremma sheepdog was referred with a two month history of diarrhoea associated with progressive tetraparesis, depression and right circling. Stupor, severe proprioceptive deficits, bilateral decreased thoracic limb flexor reflexes and bilateral deficit of the menace reaction were detected on neurological examination and a multi-focal neurological localisation was suspected. Histopathological evaluation revealed multi-focal granulomatous foci in the thalamus, hippocampus and caudal brainstem containing numerous oval-rounded organisms with a thick, periodic acid-Schiff-positive and Gomori?s methenamine silver-positive cell wall, a basophilic cytoplasm and one nucleus. Scattered sporangia containing two to four endospores were also observed. Morphological features were consistent with Prototheca species. Ultrastructurally, numerous degenerated algae were present within macrophages mainly lacking nuclei and cytoplasmic organelles. Generally, protothecosis in dogs is characterised by systemic signs because of a multi-organ involvement, and haemorrhagic colitis or ophthalmologic signs are the most frequent presenting signs. However, protothecosis should be added, also in Europe, to the list of the differential diagnoses in adult dogs with a multi-focal neurological localisation even in absence of other clinical signs.
