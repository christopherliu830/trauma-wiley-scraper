AB  - Abstract Ankle and foot injuries are the most common musculoskeletal injuries presenting to Australian EDs and are associated with a large societal and economic impact. The quality of ED care provided to patients with ankle and foot fractures or soft tissue injuries is critical to ensure the best possible outcomes for the patient. This rapid review investigated best practice for the assessment and management of common ankle and foot injuries in the ED. Databases including PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, TRIP and the grey literature, including relevant organisational websites, were searched in 2017. Primary studies, systematic reviews and guidelines were considered for inclusion. English language articles published in the last 12?years that addressed the acute assessment, management or prognosis in the ED were included. Data extraction of included articles was conducted, followed by quality appraisal to rate the level of evidence where possible. The search revealed 1242 articles, of which 71 were included in the review (n?=?22 primary articles, n?=?35 systematic reviews and n?=?14 guidelines). This rapid review provides clinicians managing fractures and soft tissue injuries of the ankle and foot in the ED a summary of the best available evidence to enhance the quality of care for optimal patient outcomes. Following a thorough history and physical examination, including the application of the Ottawa ankle rules, ED clinicians should not only provide a diagnosis, but rate the severity of soft tissue injuries, or stability of fractures and dislocations, which are the pivotal decision points in guiding ED treatment, specialist referral and the follow-up plan.

AB  - Introduction Antimicrobial resistance is a growing concern with implications for animal health. This study investigated the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among commensal and environmental Escherichia coli isolated from animals sampled in referral hospitals in the UK. Materials and Methods Resistant Escherichia coli isolated from animal faeces and practice environments were tested for susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. PCR and sequencing techniques were used to identify extended spectrum beta-lactamase and AmpC-producer genotypes. Results In total, 333 faecal and 257 environmental samples were collected. Multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli were found in 13·1% of faecal and 8·9% of environmental samples. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase and AmpC genes were identified 14% and 7·7% of faecal samples and 8·6% and 8·6% of environmental samples, respectively. The most common extended spectrum beta-lactamase gene type detected was blaCTX-M ?15, although blaTEM-158 was detected in faecal and environmental samples from one practice. Clinical Significance Escherichia coli resistant to key antimicrobials were isolated from hospitalised animals and the practice environment. We identified the emergence of the inhibitor resistant and extended spectrum beta-lactamase blaTEM-158 in companion animals. Further investigation to determine risk factors for colonisation with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria is needed to provide evidence for antimicrobial stewardship and infection control programmes.

AB  - Abstract Background:? To assess pediatric bicycle-related traumatization in view of types of injuries, incidence and modes of prevention. Methods:? Retrospective study of pediatric cases admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit of a university-affiliated level II trauma hospital in Israel over 12 consecutive years. Results:? Forty-six patients (three girls, 43 boys) with bicycle-related injuries formed 1% of the total pediatric intensive care unit admissions during the study period. The number of patients with bicycle-related injuries increased significantly during recent years (1996?2001 vs 2002?07: P= 0.003). Most of the cases presented abdominal injuries (54.4%) followed by head (32.6%) and chest (13%) injuries. The median age of patients with abdominal trauma was significantly lower in comparison to patients with other types of injuries (P= 0.002). Abdominal cases required longer hospitalization compared with other patients (P= 0.003). Falling from a bicycle was the main mechanism of injury in abdominal cases (88%) (P= 0.003). Motor vehicle impacts were the main mechanism of injury in patients with head (60%) and chest (66.6%) trauma. Conclusion:? The incidence of severe bicycle-related injuries requiring intensive care hospitalization is increasing and abdominal trauma forms the main portion of those injuries. We suggest introducing a trunk-protective measure for young bicyclists. Exact information on the mechanism of the injury is important for evaluating the injured patient more accurately.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate robotic dry laboratory (dry lab) exercises in terms of their face, content, construct and concurrent validities. To evaluate the applicability of the Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS) tool to assess dry lab performance. Materials and Methods Participants were prospectively categorized into two groups: robotic novice (no cases as primary surgeon) and robotic expert (≥30 cases). Participants completed three virtual reality (VR) exercises using the da Vinci Skills Simulator (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), as well as corresponding dry lab versions of each exercise (Mimic Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) on the da Vinci Surgical System. Simulator performance was assessed by metrics measured on the simulator. Dry lab performance was blindly video-evaluated by expert review using the six-metric GEARS tool. Participants completed a post-study questionnaire (to evaluate face and content validity). A Wilcoxon non-parametric test was used to compare performance between groups (construct validity) and Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to assess simulation to dry lab performance (concurrent validity). Results The mean number of robotic cases experienced for novices was 0 and for experts the mean (range) was 200 (30?2000) cases. Expert surgeons found the dry lab exercises both ?realistic? (median [range] score 8 [4?10] out of 10) and ?very useful? for training of residents (median [range] score 9 [5?10] out of 10). Overall, expert surgeons completed all dry lab tasks more efficiently (P < 0.001) and effectively (GEARS total score P < 0.001) than novices. In addition, experts outperformed novices in each individual GEARS metric (P < 0.001). Finally, in comparing dry lab with simulator performance, there was a moderate correlation overall (r = 0.54, P < 0.001). Most simulator metrics correlated moderately to strongly with corresponding GEARS metrics (r = 0.54, P < 0.001). Conclusions The robotic dry lab exercises in the present study have face, content, construct and concurrent validity with the corresponding VR tasks. Until now, the assessment of dry lab exercises has been limited to basic metrics (i.e. time to completion and error avoidance). For the first time, we have shown it is feasibile to apply a global assessment tool (GEARS) to dry lab training.

AB  - ABSTRACT The purposes of this study were (1) to develop and validate measures of diagnostic problem solving that might be useful in the selection of medical students and in evaluating performance during training, and (2) to improve our understanding of the cognitive processes involved in such problem solving. The study involved three kinds of measures. (1) Criterion tests were paper-and-pencil simulations of the salient aspects of medical diagnostic situations. Three such problems used a free-response format that required examinees to think of ideas for themselves, while three employed a structured-response (expanded multiple-choice) format. (2) Experimental selection tests were paper-and-pencil simulations of situations that present problems of a nonmedical nature and that could presumably be solved by methods like those used for medical problems. Both free-response and structured-response problems were included. (3) Process measures were selected from existing test batteries to measure cognitive abilities and personality characteristics thought to be involved in carrying out problem-solving activities. All three kinds of measures were administered to 122 fourth-year medical students. The selection tests and the process variables were given to 97 first-year students. Finally, a small number (30) of advanced residents took the criterion tests only. Data from student records, such as MCAT and National Board scores, were also obtained as appropriate.

AB  - Abstract A three-group quasi-experimental design contrasted the responses of rescue workers to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake Interstate 880 freeway collapse (n = 198) with responses to critical incident exposure of Bay Area Controls (n = 140) and San Diego Controls (n = 101). The three groups were strikingly similar with respect to demographics and years of emergency service. The I-880 group reported higher exposure, greater immediate threat appraisal, and more sick days. The three groups did not differ on current symptoms. For the sample as a whole EMT/ Paramedics reported higher peritraumatic dissociation compared with Police. EMT/ Paramedics and California road workers reported higher symptoms compared with Police and Fire personnel. Nine percent of the sample were characterized as having symptom levels typical of psychiatric outpatients. Compared with lower distress responders, those with greater distress reported greater exposure, greater peritraumatic emotional distress, greater peritraumatic dissociation, greater perceived threat, and less preparation for the critical incident.

AB  - Adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASCs) represent a widely used cell source with multi-lineage differentiation capacity in approaches for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Despite the multitude of literature on their differentiation capacity, little is reported about the physiological properties contributing to and controlling the process of lineage differentiation. Direct intercellular communication between adjacent cells via gap junctions has been shown to modulate differentiation processes in other cell types, with connexin 43 (Cx43) being the most abundant isoform of the gap junction-forming connexins. Thus, in the present study we focused on the expression of Cx43 and gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) in human ASCs, and its significance for adipogenic differentiation of these cells. Cx43 expression in ASCs was demonstrated histologically and on the gene and protein expression level, and was shown to be greatly positively influenced by cell seeding density. Functionality of gap junctions was proven by dye transfer analysis in growth medium. Adipogenic differentiation of ASCs was shown to be also distinctly elevated at higher cell seeding densities. Inhibition of GJIC by 18α-glycyrrhetinic acid (AGA) significantly compromised adipogenic differentiation, as demonstrated by histology, triglyceride quantification, and adipogenic marker gene expression. Flow cytometry analysis showed a lower proportion of cells undergoing adipogenesis when GJIC was inhibited, further indicating the importance of GJIC in the differentiation process. Altogether, this study demonstrates the impact of direct cell?cell communication via gap junctions on the adipogenic differentiation process of ASCs, and may contribute to further integrate direct intercellular crosstalk in rationales for tissue engineering approaches.

AB  - ABSTRACT Orthogonal plate osteosynthesis enhances fixation stability in periprosthetic femur fractures. Another option are locking attachment plates (LAP) allowing bicortical locking screw placement lateral to the prosthesis stem. Stability of lateral plate osteosynthesis with two LAP (2LAP) was compared to anterolateral orthogonal plate osteosynthesis (OP) with one LAP in a periprosthetic femur fracture model. In six pairs of fresh frozen human femora with cemented Charnley hip prosthesis, a transverse osteotomy was set distal to the tip of the prosthesis simulating a Vancouver type B1 fracture. Each pair was instrumented using a plate tensioner with either one lateral plate and two LAP, or two orthogonal anterolateral plates and one LAP. Stiffness was determined in a four-point-bending test prior to cyclic testing (2Hz) with physiologic profile and progressively increasing load up to catastrophic construct failure. Paired t-test and Wilcoxon-signed-rank test were used for statistical evaluation at a level of significance p?=?0.05. The OP construct exhibited a significantly higher number of cycles and load to failure (39,627 cycles?±?4,056; 4,463?N?±?906) compared to the 2LAP construct (32,927 cycles?±?3,487; 3,793?N?±?849), p?<?0.01. Mediolateral bending and torsional stiffness of the OP (1610?N/mm?±?249; 16.9?Nm/mm?±?6.3) were significantly higher compared to 2?LAP (1077?N/mm?±?189; 12.1?Nm/mm?±?3.9), p?=?0.03 for both comparisons. Orthogonal plate osteosynthesis is a valuable option in periprosthetic fracture surgery, offering increased stability compared to a single lateral plate fixed with two LAP. ? 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Three-dimensional (3D) printing, or additive manufacturing, is now a widely used tool in pre-operative planning, surgical teaching and simulator training. However, 3D printing technology that produces models with accurate haptic feedback, biomechanics and visuals for the training surgeon is not currently available. Challenges and opportunities in creating such surgical models will be discussed in this review paper. Surgery requires proper tissue handling as well as knowledge of relevant anatomy. To prepare doctors properly, training models need to take into account the biomechanical properties of the anatomical structures that will be manipulated in any given operation. This review summarises and evaluates the current biomechanical literature as it relates to human tissues and correlates the impact of this knowledge on developing high fidelity 3D printed surgical training models. We conclude that, currently, a printer technology has not yet been developed which can replicate many of the critical qualities of human tissue. Advances in 3D printing technology will be required to allow the printing of multi-material products to achieve the mechanical properties required.

AB  - Abstract Background The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of inherited, progressive, multi-system lysosomal storage disorders. Musculoskeletal manifestations include nerve entrapment syndromes, most commonly carpal tunnel syndrome. Tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS) has also been reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical course of MPS patients with suspected TTS and to conduct a literature review of TTS in MPS. Methods A review of the Medline and EMBASE databases was conducted in accordance with published guidelines from the Joanna Briggs Institute of Evidence Based Medicine with search strategy developed by a librarian trained in systematic reviews. A medical record review was undertaken for all patients managed in the multi-disciplinary MPS clinic in a tertiary referral paediatric centre, identifying patients with a suspected or established diagnosis of TTS. Data regarding the demographics, investigations, presentation, management, and clinical course were collected. Results The literature review failed to identify any published papers regarding TTS in MPS, with conference proceedings only identified. Within a cohort of 19 MPS patients, four patients with a suspected diagnosis of TTS were identified (MPS I: two patients, MPS VI: two patients). Three patients underwent surgical tarsal tunnel decompression, two with good result. One patient had overlapping symptoms with spinal stenosis and improvement in suspected tarsal tunnel symptoms following spinal decompression and fusion.

AB  - Abstract? It was examined whether bulimia and dissociation are common in male self-cutters, as has been found in female self-cutters. The subjects were 796 male inmates of a juvenile prison. A self-reporting questionnaire was used to assess self-cutting, histories of psychoactive substance use, problem behaviors, and traumatic life events in the subjects. The Adolescent Dissociative Experience Scale and the Bulimia Investigatory Test of Edinburgh were also used. Subjects were divided into two groups: self-cutting and non-cutting. Questionnaire responses and dissociation and bulimia assessments were compared between the groups. Self-cutters began smoking (P?<?0.001) and drinking (P?<?0.001) earlier, and more frequently used illicit psychoactive drugs (P?<?0.001), experienced childhood physical abuse (P?<?0.001), and reported suicide attempts (P?<?0.001), suicidal ideation (P?<?0.001), and outward violence toward a person (P?<?0.001) or object (P?<?0.001) than non-cutters. Self-cutters also scored significantly higher on the bulimia (P?<?0.001) and dissociation tests (P?<?0.001). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that suicide attempt (odds ratio, 4.311) and suicidal ideation (odds ratio, 2.336) could discriminate between male inmates with and without self-cutting. Male self-cutters showed ?multi-impulsive bulimic? tendencies resembling those of female self-cutters, although to a lesser extent. Clinical features of male as opposed to female self-cutters were influenced by gender differences.

AB  - Objective To test whether polygenic risk score for schizophrenia (PRS-S) interacts with childhood adversity and daily-life stressors to influence momentary mental state domains (negative affect, positive affect, and subtle psychosis expression) and stress-sensitivity measures. Methods The data were retrieved from a general population twin cohort including 593 adolescents and young adults. Childhood adversity was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Daily-life stressors and momentary mental state domains were measured using ecological momentary assessment. PRS-S was trained on the latest Psychiatric Genetics Consortium schizophrenia meta-analysis. The analyses were conducted using multilevel mixed-effects tobit regression models. Results Both childhood adversity and daily-life stressors were associated with increased negative affect, decreased positive affect, and increased subtle psychosis expression, while PRS-S was only associated with increased positive affect. No gene?environment correlation was detected. There is novel evidence for interaction effects between PRS-S and childhood adversity to influence momentary mental states [negative affect (b = 0.07, P = 0.013), positive affect (b = ?0.05, P = 0.043), and subtle psychosis expression (b = 0.11, P = 0.007)] and stress-sensitivity measures. Conclusion Exposure to childhood adversities, particularly in individuals with high PRS-S, is pleiotropically associated with emotion dysregulation and psychosis proneness.

AB  - Summary.? Twenty years after its first use in the diagnostic workup of suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE), fibrin D-dimer (DD) testing has gained wide acceptance for ruling out this disease. The test is particularly useful in the outpatient population referred to the emergency department because of suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), in which the ruling out capacity concerns every third patient clinically suspected of having the disease. This usefulness is based on the high sensitivity of the test to the presence of VTE, at least for some assays. Due to its poor specificity precluding its use for ruling in VTE, DD testing must be integrated in comprehensive, sequential diagnostic strategies that include clinical probability assessment and imaging techniques such as lower limb venous compression ultrasonography for suspected DVT or multi-slice helical computed tomography for suspected PE. The present narrative review updates the data available on the use of the various commercially available DD assays in the diagnostic approach of clinically suspected VTE in distinct patient populations or situations, including outpatients and inpatients, patients with cancer, older age, pregnancy, a suspected recurrent event, limited thrombus burden, and patients already on anticoagulant treatment.

AB  - The case study uses secondary information to examine the financial crisis that morphed into public health emergency in Flint, Michigan. While previous crisis management studies have examined financial crises and public health emergencies, the present study embodies both of them and offers an opportunity to understand how multi-level governments cooperate in responding to multiple emergencies. The overarching question of interest is how do local governments cooperate with multi-level governments to respond to multiple local emergencies? The specific research questions are as follows: (i) What are the causes, consequences, cautions, and coping strategies of the Flint crises; (ii) What are the roles of multi-level governments in responding to the Flint crises? and (iii) What are the indicators of success and failure in the response by multi-level governments to the Flint crises? The paper draws on the American federalism and crisis management scholarship for context and finds that crisis management leadership, effective communication, subsidiarity principles as in multi-level response, and accountability are necessary for effective response efforts that build resilient organizations. The findings corroborate previous studies making the present study generalizable to other emergencies. Local governments can learn from the Flint experience in mitigating the impact of crises.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare rectal (CR°), coronary band (PCB°) and ear base (PE°) temperatures with pulmonary arterial temperature (CPA°), and to investigate the relationship between core?peripheral temperature difference ([C???P]t°) and cardiac output (Qt) in an acute ovine trauma model (PIL 60/9064). Study design? Observational study. Animals? Thirteen mixed-breed male sheep, body mass (mean?±?SD) 45.50?±?4.21?kg, aged approximately 1?year. Materials and methods? Anaesthesia was induced with intravenous etomidate 0.5?mg?kg?1 and midazolam 0.5?mg?kg?1 and following endotracheal intubation maintained with halothane in a 2:1 N2O:O2 mixture. The lungs were mechanically ventilated to maintain normocapnia. Core temperature was measured using a pulmonary arterial thermistor. Rectal temperature and peripheral temperatures at the thoracic limb coronary band and ear base were recorded using themistor probes with a multi-channel recorder. Cardiac output was measured by continuous thermodilution. Recordings were taken hourly over a 24-hour period. After baseline data collection, hypovolaemia was induced by haemorrhage from bilateral femoral fractures. The development of hypovolaemic shock was confirmed by falling Qt, central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure and urine output. Resuscitation was attempted using intravenous fluids, inotropes and vasoconstrictors. Nine sheep received lumbosacral extradural bupivacaine. Results? The rectal temperature correlated closely with pulmonary arterial temperature in all sheep (rc?=?0.924). There was no consistent statistically significant relationship between Qt and [C???P]t°. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Rectal temperature accurately reflected core temperature in anaesthetized sheep but [C???P]t° was unrelated to Qt, under the conditions described in this study.

AB  - The study describes a battery of clinical neuropsychological tests, and aims to show that inferences about underlying functions can be drawn from the results. The test battery is applied to a sample of 108 aphasic patients, and is shown to measure performances with acceptable stability across testing sessions and relatively independently of general background factors. The results of factor analysis show that five underlying functions can be assessed. A functional model is described and the factors are interpreted as reflecting the functions of Praxis, Attention, Language, Motor Deficit, and Perceptual Integration. Although aphasia is defined as a disturbance of language, the aphasic patient is best described by a functional profile with dimensions based on the factors isolated.
