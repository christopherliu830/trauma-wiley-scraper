AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare rectal (CR°), coronary band (PCB°) and ear base (PE°) temperatures with pulmonary arterial temperature (CPA°), and to investigate the relationship between core?peripheral temperature difference ([C???P]t°) and cardiac output (Qt) in an acute ovine trauma model (PIL 60/9064). Study design? Observational study. Animals? Thirteen mixed-breed male sheep, body mass (mean?±?SD) 45.50?±?4.21?kg, aged approximately 1?year. Materials and methods? Anaesthesia was induced with intravenous etomidate 0.5?mg?kg?1 and midazolam 0.5?mg?kg?1 and following endotracheal intubation maintained with halothane in a 2:1 N2O:O2 mixture. The lungs were mechanically ventilated to maintain normocapnia. Core temperature was measured using a pulmonary arterial thermistor. Rectal temperature and peripheral temperatures at the thoracic limb coronary band and ear base were recorded using themistor probes with a multi-channel recorder. Cardiac output was measured by continuous thermodilution. Recordings were taken hourly over a 24-hour period. After baseline data collection, hypovolaemia was induced by haemorrhage from bilateral femoral fractures. The development of hypovolaemic shock was confirmed by falling Qt, central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure and urine output. Resuscitation was attempted using intravenous fluids, inotropes and vasoconstrictors. Nine sheep received lumbosacral extradural bupivacaine. Results? The rectal temperature correlated closely with pulmonary arterial temperature in all sheep (rc?=?0.924). There was no consistent statistically significant relationship between Qt and [C???P]t°. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Rectal temperature accurately reflected core temperature in anaesthetized sheep but [C???P]t° was unrelated to Qt, under the conditions described in this study.

AB  - Abstract Neck pain and whiplash injuries are a common presentation to the ED, and a frequent cause of disability globally. This rapid review investigated best practice for the assessment and management of musculoskeletal neck pain in the ED. PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, TRIP and the grey literature, including relevant organisational websites, were searched in 2017. Primary studies, systematic reviews and guidelines were considered for inclusion. English-language articles published in the past 12 years addressing acute neck pain assessment, management or prognosis in the ED were included. Data extraction was conducted, followed by quality appraisal to rate levels of evidence where possible. The search revealed 2080 articles, of which 51 were included (n?=?22 primary articles, n?=?13 systematic reviews and n?=?16 guidelines). Consistent evidence was found to support the use of ?red flags? to screen for serious pathologies, judicious use of imaging through clinical decision rule application and promotion of functional exercise coupled with advice and reassurance. Clinicians may also consider applying risk-stratification methods, such as using a clinical prediction rule, to guide patient discharge and referral plans; however, the evidence is still emerging in this population. This rapid review provides clinicians managing neck pain in the ED a summary of the best available evidence to enhance quality of care and optimise patient outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Background Information regarding clinical signs, assessment, treatment, and outcome in cats with hiatal hernia (HH) is limited. Objectives To characterize the clinical presentation of HH and medical and surgical outcomes in a cohort of affected cats. Animals Thirty-one client-owned cats with HH. Methods Medical records of cats with HH were retrospectively reviewed for signalment, history, results of diagnostic tests, details of surgical and medical treatments, complications, and outcome. Long-term follow-up data were obtained by telephone communication. Relationships between clinical variables and outcome were evaluated by regression analysis. Results Type I HH was present in 85.7% (24/28) of cats, and 64.5% (20/31) were >3?years of age at diagnosis. Twenty-one of 31 (67.7%) cats underwent surgical repair including phrenoplasty, esophagopexy, and left-sided gastropexy, and 10 of 31 cats were treated medically without surgery. Concurrent illness was common, and 77.4% cats had comorbidities. All cats survived to discharge, and median time to death or follow-up was 959?days (range, 3-4015?days). Cats treated medically survived longer than cats treated surgically, with median time to death or follow-up of 2559 and 771?days, respectively. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Type I HH is the most common type of HH in cats. A congenital etiology is possible, but many cats with HH were >3?years of age at diagnosis and suffered from comorbidities, including upper airway obstruction. Case selection and the presence of comorbidities likely influenced the outcome. Cats with HH may not be diagnosed until disease is advanced or concurrent illness draws attention to clinical signs.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: Laryngotracheal stenosis is a complex problem resulting most often from intubation, trauma,or autoimmune disease. Management options include dilation or airway reconstruction including laryngotracheoplasty (LTP), cricotracheal resection (CTR), and tracheal resection (TR). We describe our experience with management of this difficult problem. Study Design: Retrospective chart review of patients treated for laryngotracheal stenosis between January 1995 and July 2005 at an academic, tertiary referral center. Methods: A total of 127 patients were treated during the study period. Patients were followed, and hospital records were reviewed. Results: There were 38 male and 89 female patients with an average age of 55.5 years treated for laryngotracheal stenosis resulting from intubation (64), idiopathic (25) or autoimmune disease (18), radiation (9), trauma (5), prior surgery (4), and relapsing polychondritis (2). Thirty-three percent were treated for grade I stenosis, 44% grade II, 19% grade III, and 4% grade IV. Seventy percent of patients undergoing initial dilation required a subsequent procedure. LTP, CTR, or TR was performed in 43%, 48%, 71%, and 100% of patients with grade I through IV stenosis, respectively. Among 76 patients undergoing LTP, CTR, or TR, 24 (32%) required a subsequent intervention. Among 36 patients treated with primary LTP, CTR, or TR, only 10 (28%) required further therapy. Twenty-two of 35 (63%) tracheostomy-dependent patients were ultimately decannulated. Three patients died in the immediate postoperative period. Conclusions: Patients undergoing dilation for laryngotracheal stenosis require multiple procedures. However, major reconstructive procedures are well tolerated and currently represent a viable primary treatment for laryngotracheal stenosis.

AB  - Abstract Urinary diversion techniques are commonly required in the emergency room to correct life-threatening electrolyte and metabolic derangements resulting from urinary tract obstruction or leakage. These techniques may be permanent or temporary; temporary techniques are most often utilized in the ER to avoid long periods of anesthesia or sedation in critically ill animals as part of damage control surgical techniques. The most commonly used diversion technique is urethral catheterization. However, depending on the location of obstruction or trauma, other techniques such as cystostomy tubes or abdominal drainage catheters may be indicated. The implementation of interventional radiology in veterinary patients has also provided many alternative techniques within this setting.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Decreased efficacy of veterinary antimicrobials and increased prevalence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) is of concern, but little is known of antimicrobial resistance encompassing the New Zealand (NZ) equine population. Recent concerns have arisen over the emergence of multi-resistant bacteria [1], especially on NZ stud farms where antibiotics are frequently used for respiratory disease without veterinary input [2]. Objectives To describe bacterial culture and antimicrobial sensitivity results from respiratory samples submitted of young horses (4 weeks to 3 years old). Study design Retrospective study of clinical pathology records. Methods A database search for isolates and sensitivity of respiratory samples from young horses (April 2004?July 2014) was conducted. The results of in vitro sensitivity testing by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion were tabulated for major bacterial species isolated. Multiple correspondence analysis was used to describe clustering of multi-drug resistance (MDR) and selected demographic variables. Results 237/289 eligible respiratory samples had at least one aerobic bacterial isolate. Most of the 774 bacterial isolates were Gram-positive (68%). Streptococcus species were the most common genus isolated (40% of isolates). Sensitivity of Streptococcus spp. to penicillin, gentamicin and ceftiofur was >85%, but only 53% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxone. Gram-negative sensitivity to ceftiofur, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxone was <75%. MDR was found for 16% of isolates and in 39% of horses. Conclusions Penicillin is an appropriate first-line antimicrobial for use in most NZ young horses with suspected bacterial respiratory infection. However, based on findings of MDR, submission of samples for culture and monitoring of sensitivity should be used to inform antimicrobial selection. Ethical animal research:?Not applicable. Sources of funding:?Massey University McGeorge Fund; New Zealand Equine Research Foundation. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Abstract Objective There is some speculation that an intact distal sphincter complex is of decisive importance for continence, although the external anal sphincter (EAS) is considered to be a single functional and anatomical entity. On trans-labial ultrasound (TLUS), the caudal slice at the level of the subcutaneous EAS is currently omitted from the diagnostic algorithm due to the prevalence of artefact at that level. Hence, we aim to determine the predictive value of assessment of the subcutaneous EAS for anal incontinence. Methods We analysed datasets of 463 women seen at our urogynaecological service in 2015. All underwent a standardized questionnaire including a St Mark's incontinence score (SMIS), clinical examination and 4D TLUS. Slices 1 to 7 were assessed and rated positive for a defect if the defect angle was >=30-degrees. Results While there was a highly significant association between all measures of anal incontinence (AI) and significant EAS trauma in slice 7, addition of the 7th slice to the existing 6-slice model did not improve the predictive value for AI. Conclusion As inclusion of the subcutaneous slice of the EAS on the TLUS does not seem to improve the predictive value of AI, the current methodology for EAS trauma on tomographic ultrasound can remain unchanged.

AB  - A key assumption of general strain theory (GST) is that various factors condition the effects of strains on crime. Past research examining this conditioning hypothesis tended to focus on youth samples and use gender as a control variable. Using survey data from Chinese female inmates, this study tests the strain?crime relationship posited in GST as well as the hypothesized effects of the conditioning factors. Regression results show that different types of strains have distinct effects on respondents? odds to commit violent over property crimes. Conditioning factors are found to moderate the strengths of strains toward respondents? likelihood to commit property crimes over violent crimes.

The aim was to evaluate the disinfection properties of six multi-purpose contact lens disinfection solutions (MPDS) available in Iran against Fusarium solani and Candida albicans, based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14729 guidelines. Methods:? Three lots each of six multi-purpose solutions, namely, Renu MultiPlus, Solo Care Aqua, All-Clean soft, Contact All In One Advanced, Hippia, Ginza Multi-Purpose Solution and 0.9% normal saline solution were inoculated with standard strains of Fusarium solani (ATCC 36031) and Candida albicans (ATCC 10231). Surviving fungi were determined by counting colony-forming units on recovery plates at specified times. The mean log reduction in fungal numbers at the manufacturer's minimum recommended disinfection time was determined and compared with the criteria for stand-alone disinfection products for each MPDS against each fungal strain. Results:? Renu MultiPlus, Contact All In One Advanced and All-Clean Soft were effective in achieving the mean 1.0 log reduction in fungal numbers, based on ISO 14729 stand-alone primary acceptance criteria. Solo Care Aqua failed to achieve the ISO 14729 stand-alone primary acceptance criteria for Candida albicans. The other solutions were not effective against test microorganisms after the specified times. Conclusions:? There were differences in the rates of disinfection efficacy. Generally, Renu MultiPlus, Contact All In One Advanced and All-Clean Soft exceeded the primary acceptance criteria of the ISO 14729 guidelines for stand-alone contact lens solutions.

AB  - Abstract:? First described in the 1500s, scurvy is infrequently seen in industrialized countries today, although vulnerable patient groups remain. A 15-yr-old girl underwent liver transplantation at age 26?months for a primary diagnosis of biliary hypoplasia, and subsequently developed late allograft failure and progressive renal insufficiency culminating in listing for combined liver retransplantation and kidney transplantation at age 13?yr. She required regular hemodialysis treatment for 12?months prior to deceased donor organ availability, with a complicated clinical course including recurrent septic episodes and severe cachexia. Ten months after initiation of hemodialysis, she presented with severe bone pain, purpura, ecchymoses, gingival hyperplasia, mucosal bleeding, and subconjunctival hemorrhages. Serial serum ascorbic acid levels were found to be extremely low (<10??mol/L) despite routine supplementation both in her dialysate and via regular oral supplementation. Histopathology from skin biopsy revealed purpura, hyper- and parakeratosis, and follicular plugging. She had ECG and 2D echocardiogram disturbances, as well as osteopenia and sclerosis of the extremities on radiological evaluations. Therapy with high-dose ascorbic acid (1?g/day orally) led to complete resolution of skin lesions. This case highlights the importance of awareness and recognition of this historic diagnosis, and particularly in children with end-stage organ disease with severely compromised nutrition.

AB  - Background Clinicians are routinely required to make decisions about fall risk among lower limb prosthesis (LLP) users. These decisions can be guided by standardized clinical balance tests but require population- and test-specific cutoff scores and validity indices to categorize individuals as probable fallers or nonfallers on the basis of test performance. Despite the importance of cutoff scores and validity indices to clinical interpretation of clinical balance test scores, they are rarely reported for LLP users. In their absence, clinicians cannot use results from clinical balance tests to assess the likelihood of a fall by any one patient. Objective Derive cutoff scores, and associated validity indices, for clinical balance tests administered to established unilateral LLP users. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Outpatient clinic and research laboratory. Participants Established ambulatory unilateral transtibial and transfemoral prosthesis users (n?=?40). Intervention Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure(s) Optimal cutoff scores and related validity indices (ie, area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios) were computed for five balance tests, the activities-specific balance confidence scale (ABC), timed up and go (TUG), four square step test (FSST), Berg balance scale (BBS), and narrowing-beam walking test (NBWT). Results Cutoff scores were identified for the NBWT (≤.43/1.0), TUG (≥8.17?seconds], FSST (≥8.49 seconds), BBS (≤50.5/56), and ABC (≤80.2/100). Validity indices (ie, area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios) for the NBWT, TUG, and FSST had greater diagnostic accuracy and provided more information about the probability of a fall than those for the BBS or ABC. Conclusion Performance above or below identified cutoff scores for the NBWT, FSST, and TUG provides information about potentially important shifts in the probability of falling among established unilateral LLP users. These results can serve as initial benchmarks to reduce uncertainty surrounding fall risk assessment in established unilateral LLP users but require future prospective evaluation.

This was confirmed by a radiograph of the lip that showed a radiopaque material, being similar to the coronal fragment of the fractured incisor. It was successfully surgically removed and immediately reattached using a composite adhesive technique. At the follow-up of 1?year later the vitality test on the teeth was positive and neither one of the two traumatized teeth showed any sign of discoloration.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides an overview of the principles of orthopaedic elective surgery and some of the common surgical procedures. The patient pathway of pre-, peri- and post-operative care will be described and the implications for nursing care discussed. The evidence base for practice, including enhanced recovery programmes, will be explored so that the practitioner can ensure they are providing the optimum care for patients.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Bipolar disorder is marked by progressive symptomatic changes, which have been linked with episode-related structural findings?particularly in the prefrontal cortex. However, few studies have examined neurofunctional and neurochemical effects of disease burden. In this study, we compared first- and multi-episode bipolar individuals. We hypothesized that the latter would demonstrate evidence of neurophysiological differences consistent with a model of progressive functional degradation of these networks. Methods First- and multi-episode manic bipolar subjects participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) including a continuous performance task with emotional distractors, and in single-voxel (1H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). A priori fMRI regions-of-interest (ROI) included structures comprising prefrontal-striatal-amygdala networks; (1H)MRS voxels were placed within bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal (VLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Both ROI and voxel-based brain activation in response to emotional stimuli, and neurochemical concentrations derived from (1H)MRS were compared across bipolar groups. Results Multi-episode bipolar subjects showed relatively lower regional activation across prefrontal-striatal-amygdala networks, including bilateral VLPFC, orbitofrontal cortex, ACC, putamen, caudate, and amygdala. Exploratory whole-brain, voxel-based analysis suggested additional areas of lower activation extending into Brodmann area 22, posterior parietal regions, and right thalamus. Glutamate and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) concentrations were also relatively lower in the ACC of multi-episode subjects. Conclusions Disease burden, exemplified by multiple affective episodes is associated with evidence of widespread decrements in affective network activity. Lower ACC NAA concentration is similarly consistent with a model of progressive functional deficits. These findings support the functional significance of previously observed progressive structural changes throughout these regions.

AB  - Abstract Background: There are very few formal language assessments aimed at the very severely neurologically impaired individual. These individuals often have multiple deficits on top of their communication impairment that demand a novel approach to assessment. The authors set out to devise a tool (PASWORD) to enable professionals in this field to screen their clients' ability to understand and respond to very simple, closed questions by using their preferred modality. Aims: PASWORD assessment was examined for its reliability as a tool for determining whether profoundly neurologically impaired individuals could indicate yes or no reliably to simple closed questions. Methods & Procedures: The assessment comprises 20 high-frequency objects that can be presented visually, auditorily or in the tactile modality, depending on the subject's abilities. Subjects are then asked a one-word level closed question related to the object and were asked to give a yes or no response. Seventy control subjects with no neurological impairment first underwent the PASWORD test to assess for ambiguities in the test items (group 1, n = 74). Neurologically impaired subjects at the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability in the two experimental groups were allocated according to the opinion of the experienced multidisciplinary team, which observed the subjects closely over a period of time, in different contexts. Those that the team agreed were reliably able to answer simple yes/no questions on observation (group 2, n = 9) and those the team agreed could not indicate yes/no reliably to closed questions (group 3, n = 7). The results of the PASWORD were then compared with the original opinion of the team. Groups 2 and 3 were studied on two occasions to examine test?retest reliability. Outcomes & Results: There were no real ambiguities in the test items and the results of the PASWORD reflected the opinion of the experienced multidisciplinary team. As there are no other tests of single-word closed questions, which can be presented in any of three modalities and during which the subject can respond in any augmentative or alternative fashion, the opinion of the team at the Royal Hospital, a centre of excellence for neurorehabilitation, was used against which to measure reliability. Conclusions: The findings imply that PASWORD is a useful screening tool when assessing the basic language skills of neurologically impaired individuals, whose extensive physical, linguistic and cognitive deficits often render the administration of more traditional language assessments impossible.
