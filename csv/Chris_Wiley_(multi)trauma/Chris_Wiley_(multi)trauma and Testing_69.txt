AB  - Summary Acute pain follows surgery, diagnostic procedures, or trauma. In addition, there are many medical conditions that cause acute inflammatory pain. Acute pain after surgery or a diagnostic intervention is preventable with the pre-emptive use of analgesics. Acute pain from trauma cannot be pre-empted, and its treatment may require the use of combinations of drugs and larger dosages. The drugs used to treat acute pain can be divided into five main classes: opioids, local anesthetics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), α-2 adrenoceptor agonists, and miscellaneous drugs or adjuncts. Most opioids have minimal effects on the cardiovascular system and, consequently, are often used in protocols for dogs suffering from cardiovascular disease. The most common adverse effects reported are those associated with the gastrointestinal tract. Physical therapy techniques including passive range of motion, massage, ultrasound, low-level laser, and acupuncture can be useful adjuncts to pharmaceutical treatment of acute pain in dogs.

AB  - We present a young man who developed fat embolism syndrome following a fractured femoral shaft. By intermittently measuring oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter and varying the inspired partial pressure of oxygen we were able to quantify the development of shunt and ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch over the course of his illness. Shunt and low V/Q gradually improved in the week following admission but deteriorated following general anaesthesia for nailing of the femur.

AB  - Abstract A child who had had surgery at 5 months of age, and who had been treated at the time for post-traumatic symptoms (reported in a previous paper by the author), was interviewed 2 years later and almost 3 years later to test for possible verbal recall of his hospitalization. He appeared to have some memories of the experience at 29 months of age, and he was able to superimpose verbal labels onto the preverbal memories. At 40 months of age, however, the memories were no longer verbally accessible. The results are discussed in the context of different theories of encoding, storage, retrieval, and loss of early memories. The findings from this study support other findings indicating that there appears to be some form of long-term memory in place early in life, at least for highly salient, traumatic events. There may be one memory system for traumatic memories, fully functional at birth, and a later developing, different system for neutral memories. It is further hypothesized that there may be a sensitive period around 2?3 years of age for the recall of early traumatic memories, and that verbal recall is more likely to be present in verbally precocious children during that period.

AB  - Abstract Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging of the brain following head injury is used in two distinct clinical contexts, (1) acutely, within days of the injury, to evaluate an unexplained neurologic deficit or to obtain prognostic information, and (2) chronically, to assess the degree of brain injury and explain neurologic or neuropsychologic findings. In this unit, two basic protocols are presented, one for acute imaging and the other for chronic imaging. Advanced MR imaging sequences, such as MR spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging can provide additional prognostic information in the acute setting and are also described. MR angiography (MRA) and direct vessel wall imaging techniques are mentioned briefly.

AB  - Abstract The impact fracture resistance of crowned endodontically treated teeth with composite cores but without posts, that had either no coronal dentin remaining or a 1mm dentin collar was compared to that of unrestored, caries free teeth. The teeth were struck mid-labially to simulate a common trauma situation using a pendulum device and fracture1 resistance determined by calculation of absorbed energies. No significant difference was found between the intact teeth and the-crowned root treated teeth with composite core and a 1mm dentin collar. Crowned loot treated teeth with a composite core but no coronal dentin had significantly reduced fracture resistance (p < 0.05). Teeth with the dentin collar mainly fractured obliquely from the bueeal crown margin to a point coincident with the simulated alveolus, representing a clinical situation which would allow retention rather than extraction of the tooth.

AB  - Introduction Exercise can provide numerous benefits to haemophilia patients, including bleeding reduction in muscles and joints. Aim This systematic review (SR) aims to evaluate the effects of physical exercise on pain and the musculoskeletal function of patients with hemophilia. Methods Literature searches of Pubmed, Web of Science, PEDro, Cochrane, Clinical Trials SciELO and Lilacs were performed. The risks of bias were measured using the JADAD scale. Results Nine controlled clinical trials were included in the SR. Conclusion Physical exercise can promote a reduction in the perception of pain and can increase ROM and muscle strength in haemophilia patients. Future RCTs with greater methodological rigor that focus on the parameters used to prescribe exercises are necessary.

AB  - The parenteral multivitamin preparations that are commercially available in the United States (U.S.) meet the requirements for most patients who receive parenteral nutrition (PN). However, a separate parenteral vitamin D preparation (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) should be made available for treatment of patients with vitamin D deficiency unresponsive to oral vitamin D supplementation. Carnitine is commercially available and should be routinely added to neonatal PN formulations. Choline should also be routinely added to adult and pediatric PN formulations; however, a commercially available parenteral product needs to be developed. The parenteral multi?trace element (TE) preparations that are commercially available in the U.S. require significant modifications. Single-entity trace element products can be used to meet individual patient needs when the multiple-element products are inappropriate (see Summary/A.S.P.E.N. Recommendations section for details of these proposed modifications).

AB  - Abstract Structural equation models articulate the assumed measurement and causal relations among variables, imposing discipline on otherwise unstructured and redundant associations that arise in correlational studies. Biomedical research has eschewed such methods, relying on the generally superior causal inference afforded by randomized controlled trials. Increasingly, however, clinical trials incorporate numerous covariates that are measured but unmanipulated. Most clinical trials now also include multiple correlated endpoints, which can generate ambiguous outcome patterns refractory to simple statistical analysis and interpretation. Modern clinical trials are really multivariate longitudinal studies with at best a component of randomized control; as such, structural equation approaches can add rigour and clarity. The analysis of latent variance (LANOVA) conception combines structural equation and experimental analysis of variance legacies. It allows, for any design that can be decomposed into between-group and within-person models, tests on latent means (that is, the means of the unobserved factors) that are directly analogous to their analysis of variance counterparts. LANOVA variables are either outcomes (which may have a time structure), varying covariates (which may have a time structure), or background covariates (which are static). Allowable causal relations are set-recursive: background covariates can affect all other variables; varying covariates can affect current outcomes and later outcomes and covariates; outcomes can affect only later outcomes. All standard ANOVA and ANCOVA hypotheses can then be tested by proper restrictions among the means and intercepts of these latent variables. Structural equation modelling programs can be used to estimate the models and test the hypotheses. I demonstrate the approach by expressing and testing hypotheses appropriate for two clinical studies that evaluate patient-reported outcomes in populations with solid and haematological malignancies.

AB  - Background Various treatments are available for ear mite infestations in dogs. Objective The efficacy of sarolaner was evaluated against ear mite infestation caused by Otodectes cynotis in dogs and compared with topical moxidectin/imidacloprid in a single-masked, multi-centre field study. Animals Client-owned dogs with O. cynotis infestation were treated monthly with oral sarolaner (n = 163) or topical moxidectin/imidacloprid (n = 78). Methods The presence of mites in the ear canals and the clinical signs associated with otoacariasis (including head shaking, pruritus/ear scratching, trauma or alopecia of the pinnae, and erythema, ulceration and debris in the ear canals) was evaluated on days 0, 14 and 30, and, if applicable, on day 60. Dogs were considered cured of mite infestation following one (on day 0) or two (on days 0 and 30) monthly treatments, if no live mites were found in either ear. Non-inferiority was evaluated at days 14 and 30. Results Parasitological cure was achieved in 76.4%, 90.5% and 93.3% of the sarolaner-treated and in 53.9%, 63.5% and 66.7% of the moxidectin/imidacloprid-treated dogs on days 14, 30 and 60, respectively. At study completion, on day 60 at the latest, parasitological cure was achieved overall in 99.4% of sarolaner-treated and 87.8% of moxidectin/imidacloprid-treated cases. The parasitological cure rate for sarolaner was non-inferior to moxidectin/imidacloprid at days 14 and 30. The clinical signs of otoacariasis improved throughout the study in both groups. There were no treatment-related adverse events. Conclusions A single oral administration of sarolaner was safe and highly effective in the treatment of O. cynotis infestation in dogs.

Materials and Methods Dogs were included in this retrospective study if they had complete medical records, complete neurological examination, MR imaging, cerebellomedullary cerebrospinal fluid sample consistent with eosinophilic pleocytosis and negative infectious disease testing. Results Eleven dogs were included with a median age of 22·0?months (range 7·6 to 92·0?months). Nine breeds were represented. Neurological abnormalities included obtundation (n=10), menace response deficits (n=9), proprioceptive deficits (n=7), ataxia (n=7) and seizures (n=2). Neuroanatomical localisation was multi-focal (n=4), central vestibular system (n=4), diffuse forebrain (n=2) or left trigeminal/facial nerves (n=1). Seven dogs had peripheral eosinophilia. Ten dogs had bilateral symmetrical lesions affecting the cortical grey matter, which was hyperintense on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuating inversion recovery images and iso- to hypointense on T1-weighted images with associated meningeal contrast enhancement. MRI findings were consistent with diffuse meningitis and atrophy or necrosis of cortical grey matter. One dog had increased contrast uptake in the left trigeminal nerve. Ten dogs receiving corticosteroids survived to discharge, with seven also receiving cytarabine arabinoside. Median survival time was 762?days. Clinical Significance Eosinophilic meningoencephalitis of unknown origin affects younger larger-breed dogs, with the majority having suspected diffuse cerebrocortical meningitis and cortical (polio)encephalitis, which can be identified on MRI. Response to immunosuppressive treatment is good in the medium to long term, although further studies are required in this area.

Methods A multi-centre, stratified (by years of experience) two group parallel arm, single blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted. Participants (n = 48) were allocated to one of two groups to receive image interpretation education: (1) intensive format (13.5 h over two consecutive days) (2) non-intensive (sequential 90-min tutorials delivered 1 week apart). Participants undertook x-ray interpretation tests before education, at 1-week post-education completion and at 12-week post-education completion. Results Image interpretation performance was not significantly different between groups at baseline. A generalised linear model indicated that participants who received intensive education format improved image interpretation performance by a greater margin than the group that received non-intensive education at 1-week (P = 0.002) and 12-week (P < 0.001) follow-up assessments. Conclusions Although both formats of education delivery may be beneficial, the findings of this study have indicated that the intensive format of delivery was more effective at improving radiographers? ability to interpret trauma radiographs in the weeks after completion of the image interpretation program.

Methods A total of 225 newly diagnosed HIV-positive MSM were interviewed using a combined interviewer?computer-assisted method in Chengdu, China. Results The prevalence of UAI with regular and nonregular partners since diagnosis was 27.7% and 33.8% among participants reporting having sex with regular and nonregular partners (n = 159 and 133), respectively. Adjusted analysis showed that: (1) cognitive variables based on the Health Belief Model (perceived susceptibility to HIV transmission and perceived severity of the consequences of HIV transmission, perceived barriers and perceived self-efficacy related to consistent condom use), (2) emotion-related variables (worry about transmitting HIV to others), (3) psychological factors (post-traumatic growth) and (4) socio-structural factors (perceived partners? responsibility for condom use) were significantly associated with UAI with regular and/or nonregular partners. Conclusions Interventions are warranted, and should be designed with consideration of multi-dimensional factors and be partner type-specific.

AB  - Introduction During racing, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is a major source of energy for muscle contraction. Assessment of muscle OXPHOS capacity by high-resolution respirometry (HRR) might identify animals with altered energy metabolism and consequently increased risk of exertional rhabdomyolysis (ER). Methods Prospective cohort study. Ten healthy French Standardbreds in active training, aged 4?7 years, recruited at the start of a competitive racing season, underwent a standardised field exercise test with determination of speed at onset of lactate accumulation (VLa4) and measurement of serum creatine kinase activity (CK) two hours post-exercise. Triceps brachii muscle microbiopsies were obtained for determination of OXPHOS and electron transfer system (ETS) capacities with HRR. Associations between HRR variables and occurrence of ER over the following four months of racing were analysed using univariate logistic regression. Results Two horses developed ER during the study period: one within one month of recruitment, another presented multiple minor episodes over the season. For these ER horses OXPHOS/ETS ratio was lower, and Complex I/Complex I?+?II ratio and Complex I /Complex II ratio were higher than non-affected horses in the study (perfect prediction of occurrence of ER with ratio of ≤0.74, ≥0.60 and ≥0.715 respectively). VLa4 for ER horses was within the range of non-affected horses. Post-exercise CK was within normal limits for all horses in the study. Conclusions OXPHOS and ETS capacities and their derived ratios indicate dysfunctional muscle energy metabolism whereas VLa4 and CK were unremarkable in horses subsequently affected by ER. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by Liège University's Animal Ethics Committee (agreement N° 07-629); owner informed consent was obtained. Sources of funding:?Part of the study protocol was funded by Les Haras Nationaux (France). Competing interests:?The Oxygraph-2k HRR apparatus was provided on loan by OROBOROS Instruments (Innsbruck, Austria); there are no patents, products in development or marketed products to declare.

AB  - Abstract Pulpal healing patterns were studied in a clinical material of 637 luxated and 95 root-fractured permanent incisors followed routinely for up to 11 years. It was found that pulpal healing patterns could generally be divided into 3 groups according to the degree of injury sustained by the pulp: little, moderate or severe. Thus after luxation injuries, pulp survival could be without radiographic change (PS), with pulp canal obliteration (PCO) or nonhealing (pulp necrosis (PN)). After root fracture, similar healing patterns could be observed: healing by hard tissue union of fragments (HT), by connective tissue union of fragments (CT) or by nonunion due to interposition of granulation tissue between fragments (GT) resulting from PN of the coronal fragment. In both trauma situations, healing or nonhealing could be determined by type of luxation injury, stage of root development and type of fixation used (forceful application of orthodontic bands vs. passively applied acid-etch fixation). Pulpal healing complications (PN or GT) were based on clinical findings (coronal discoloration, loss of pulpal sensibility) and radiographic findings (resorption processes of the lamina dura at the root apex or at the level of the root fracture). However, in both injury groups the same changes could also be seen to be intermediate steps in the pulpal healing process. Based on findings from these studies, hypotheses for the mechanics of pulpal healing are proposed as well as guidelines for acute and later treatment of dental luxations, root fractures and the diagnosis of healing complications.

AB  - Abstract Understanding co-activation patterns of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and sympathetic adrenal medullary (SAM) during early adolescence may illuminate risk for development of internalizing and externalizing problems. The present study advances empirical work on the topic by examining SAM-HPA co-activation during both the reactivity and recovery phases of the stress response following acute stress exposure. Fourth and fifth grade boys and girls (N = 149) provided cortisol and alpha-amylase via saliva at seven times throughout a 95-min assessment in which they were administered the modified Trier Social Stress Test. Parents reported on adolescents? life stress, pubertal development, medication use, and externalizing problems. Adolescents reported their own internalizing symptoms. Multiple linear regressions tested both direct and interactive effects of SAM and HPA reactivity and recovery on internalizing and externalizing problems. Results from these analyses showed that whereas SAM and HPA reactivity interacted to predict internalizing symptoms, it was their interaction during the recovery phase that predicted externalizing. Concurrent high SAM and HPA reactivity scores predicted high levels of internalizing and concurrently low SAM and HPA recovery scores predicted high levels of externalizing. Implications of the findings for further study and clinical application are discussed.

AB  - Objectives To retrospectively evaluate cases presented for percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis for associated complications, identify risk factors associated with complications and to assess ultrasonographic findings and relate these to bacterial culture results. Methods Data on 300 patients presented for percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis were retrospectively collected and ultrasonographic images were assessed for defined structural changes. The incidence of major complications was determined. Multi-variable multi-level logistic regression was used to investigate the association of ultrasonographic findings with positive bile culture. Results Three hundred percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis procedures performed in 201 dogs and 51 cats were included; 35 patients had the procedure performed more than once. The overall incidence of major complications was 8 of 300 procedures (2·7%). Bile peritonitis occurred in 2 of 300 procedures (0·7%). An ultrasonographically abnormal gall bladder was found in 52% of cases and had a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 82, 55·7 and 61·5% respectively, to predict a positive bile culture. Clinical Significance Percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis is overall a safe technique when carried out in selected patients. Abnormal ultrasonographic findings are only a fair predictor of a positive bile culture.
