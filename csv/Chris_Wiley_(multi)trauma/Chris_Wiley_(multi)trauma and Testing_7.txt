AB  - Background: Since 1992 the Consultative Committee on Road Traffic Fatalities in Victoria has identified deficiencies and errors in the management of 559 road traffic fatalities in which the patients were alive on arrival of ambulance services. The Committee also assessed the preventability of deaths. Reproducibility of results using its methodology has been shown to be statistically significant. The Committee?s findings and recommendations, the latter made in association with the learned Colleges and specialist Societies, led to the establishment of a Ministerial Taskforce on Trauma and Emergency Services. As a consequence, in 2000, a new trauma care system will be implemented in Victoria. This paper presents a case example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology. Methods: The Committee has two 12 member multidisciplinary evaluative panels. A retrospective evaluation was made of the complete ambulance, hospital and autopsy records of eligible fatalities. The clinical and pathological findings were analysed using a comprehensive data proforma, a narrative summary and the complete records. Resulting multidisciplinary discussion problems were identified and the potential preventability of death was assessed. Results: In the present case example the Committee identified 16 management deficiencies of which 11 were assessed as having contributed to the patient?s death; the death, however, was judged to be non-preventable. Conclusion: The presentation of this example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology may be of assistance to hospital medical staff undertaking their own major trauma audit.

AB  - Objectives To analyse the contemporary management of renal injuries in a UK major trauma centre and to evaluate the utility and value of re-imaging. Patients and methods The prospectively maintained ?Trauma Audit and Research Network? database was interrogated to identify patients with urinary tract injuries between January 2014 and December 2017. Patients? records and imaging were reviewed to identify injury grades, interventions, outcomes, and follow-up. Results Renal injury was identified in 90 patients (79 males and 11 females). The mean (sd; range) age was 35.5 (17.4; 1.5?94) years. Most of the renal traumas were caused by blunt mechanisms (74%). The overall severity of injuries was: 18 (20%) Grade I, 19 (21%) Grade II, 27 (30%) Grade III, 22 (24%) Grade IV, and four (4%) Grade V. Most patients (84%) were managed conservatively. Early intervention (<24 h) was performed in 14 patients (16%) for renal injuries. Most of these patients were managed by interventional radiology techniques (nine of 14). Only two patients required an emergency nephrectomy, both of whom died from extensive polytrauma. In all, 19 patients underwent laparotomy for other injuries and did not require renal exploration. The overall 30-day mortality was 13%. Re-imaging was performed in 66% of patients at an average time of 3.4 days from initial scan. The majority of re-imaging was planned (49 patients) and 12% of these scans demonstrated a relevant finding (urinoma, pseudoaneurysm) that altered management in three of the 49 patients (6.1%). Conclusion Non-operative management is the mainstay for all grades of injury. Haemodynamic instability and persistent urine leak are primary indications for intervention. Open surgical management is uncommon. Repeat imaging after injury is advocated for stable patients with high-grade renal injuries (Grade III?V), although more research is needed to determine the optimal timing.

AB  - Abstract Individuals with a history of trauma, particularly maltreatment, often have accurate memories for trauma-related events. This does not mean that trauma never adversely affects autobiographical memory performance; indeed, some individuals with a trauma history reveal deficits in their memory performance while others at times show memory advantages over individuals without a trauma history. We posit here that individual differences in memory may be related in part to the emotion dysregulation and psychopathology resulting from the trauma and in part to the nature of the event to be recalled. In this chapter, we focus on the scientific literature on child maltreatment, trauma-related psychopathology, and memory from a developmental psychopathology perspective. We summarize relevant theory and research on memory development, trauma-related psychopathology symptoms, and psychophysiological and neuroscience processes relevant to child maltreatment. We also review behavioral studies on childhood trauma and autobiographical memory development. We discuss the translation of such research into clinical and legal practice. We conclude with future directions for research, with the hope of moving this crucial area of study forward to spawn new insights.

AB  - OBJECTIVES Limited guidelines exist regarding the optimal treatment of traumatic canine elbow luxation, and there is a lack of information on long-term functional outcome. Here we report reduction and stabilisation techniques for a series of traumatic elbow luxations and describe clinical outcome plus long-term questionnaire-based follow-up. METHODS Retrospective review of canine traumatic elbow luxations (2006 to 2013) treated at five referral centres. Data recorded included signalment, luxation aetiology, time to reduction, reduction technique, surgical procedure, post-reduction care and complications. Questionnaire follow-up was attempted for all cases with owners completing the Canine Brief Pain Inventory. RESULTS Thirty-seven dogs were included. The most frequent cause of luxation was road traffic accident (n=22). Twenty cases were treated surgically. Seven dogs suffered major postoperative complications: reluxation (n=6), infection requiring implant removal (n=1). Four of the six reluxations occurred in dogs that had other orthopaedic injuries. Twenty-two owners completed the Canine Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire: there were 13 excellent, 6 very good, 1 good and 2 fair outcomes. Outcome was not associated with the reduction technique. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Initial closed reduction, followed by surgical stabilisation if unsuccessful, results in good-to-excellent outcomes in the majority of traumatic canine elbow luxations. Reluxation was the most common major complication and there was a higher incidence of reluxation in patients with multiple orthopaedic injuries.

AB  - Abstract Purpose The purpose of this study was to analyze and evaluate the correlation between dental injuries and the pattern of maxillofacial fractures. The correlation with age, gender, trauma mechanism and type of maxillofacial fracture was also investigated. Materials and methods From January 2000 to December 2009, 1131 patients with facial fractures were registered. Of these, 473 presented with associated dental trauma. The information and data collected and analyzed included: age, gender, mechanism of injury, type of facial fracture, type of dental injury, and the relationship between dental injury and facial fracture. Results Dental injury was sustained by 473 patients (41.8%), with a total of 2215 injured teeth. Of the 2215 injured teeth, 1191 (53.8%) were in the maxilla and 1024 (46.2%) in the mandible. Fall from a height had the highest risk of dental injuries (OR = 4.145, P = 0.002). The central incisor was the most injured tooth for both the maxilla (388, 36.2%) and mandible (284, 27.7%). The most common type of dental injury was avulsion (1070, 47.4%). More anterior teeth in the maxilla were of crown fracture, avulsion, and intrusion than that in the mandible, whereas more anterior teeth in the mandible were of subluxation and concussion than that in the maxilla. Dental injuries were more prone to occur in patients who sustained only symphysis fractures (OR = 2.817, P < 0.001), only 0.236-fold risk in patients who sustained only mandible angle fracture (P < 0.001). Conclusions The occurrence of dental trauma is significantly related to the pattern and position of the maxillofacial fractures.

One hundred and one subjects were studied. The roles of coping behavior as a moderating factor were also tested. Psychosocial reaction during disaster and coping behavior were significantly correlated with trauma. Hierarchical regression analysis found that coping behavior was a significant potential moderating variable in terms of correlation between psychosocial reaction and trauma after a natural disaster.

AB  - Abstract Large oil spills are disasters associated with psychological effects for exposed communities. The amount of worry that individuals experience after a disaster may be influenced by many factors, such as the type and extent of exposure to disaster impacts, prior trauma, and sociodemographic characteristics. This study examined the nature and predictors of worry about ongoing impacts of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DH) oil spill reported by Gulf of Mexico coastal residents. A random sample of 2,520 adult residents of Gulf of Mexico coastal counties were administered a telephone survey in 2016, including items about persistent worry and exposure to DH impacts, prior trauma, residence at the time of the spill, and sociodemographic characteristics. Respondents varied in the amount of worry they reported about ongoing health, social, and economic impacts. Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, higher exposure to the DH oil spill was related to higher levels of worry about ongoing impacts, with past traumatic events related specifically to worry about health impacts. Unexpectedly, those who moved into the region after the spill showed similar levels of worry to residents exposed to the spill, and higher levels than residents who did not recall being exposed to the DH oil spill. This study highlights the impact of the DH oil spill on coastal residents many years after the DH disaster. The findings underscore the need to examine multiple pathways by which individuals experience disasters and for risk researchers to close knowledge gaps about long-term impacts of oil spills within a multi-dimensional framework.

AB  - Abstract Aims A mixed-methods study details a multidisciplinary team's efforts to assess and transform police response to sexual assault in a mid-size community. Method A police department-wide survey (n?=?331) determined baseline levels of officer exposure to trauma-informed training, rape myth acceptance, and awareness of community and nationwide sexual assault movements to understand officer attitudes towards factors influencing sexual assault investigations. These data, in conjunction with SAMHSA's (2012) trauma-informed assumptions, were leveraged to develop and adopt trauma-informed policies that would enhance the police department's response to sexual assault. Results At baseline, few officers reported receiving trauma-informed interviewing training (21.8%) or having knowledge of local SAK, #MeToo, or #TimesUp movements (10.0%, 7.2%, 3.9%, respectively). Chi-square analyses suggested officer knowledge of community SAK movement, personal investment in learning about sexual assault, and understanding of trauma were higher in officers with versus without training; of concern, officers with more sexual assaults on their caseload were more likely to endorse rape myths. Training understanding was related to lower rape myth acceptance. Conclusions Policy changes, including adding trauma-informed training to the Police Academy, were implemented by the MDT to promote a system-wide trauma-informed approach to sexual assault and ensure community safety.

AB  - Summary This chapter considers the various injuries that occur to the hard and soft intraoral tissues and the options that are available to treat those injuries on an immediate, midterm, and long-term basis. It discusses the equipment needed to develop a pitch-side emergency dental kit, for any dentist or associated professional who may be able to give immediate relief and treatment to an injured athlete. Trauma to the supporting structures of the teeth can be classified as: concussion, lateral luxation, subluxation, intrusion, extrusion, and avulsion. The chapter outlines the types of root fracture commonly seen, looks at the response of the tissues to root fractures, and discusses the treatment options following a root fracture. It deals with the splinting techniques that provide support for traumatized teeth during the initial healing phase. Prolonged use of a splint can result in ankylosis of the tooth, which may be transient unless the injury to the cementum is extensive.

AB  - Abstract Individuals with spinal cord injury are at risk of sacral pressure ulcers due to, among other reasons, prolonged immobilisation. The effectiveness of a multi-layer foam dressing installed pre-operatively in reducing sacral pressure ulcer occurrence in spinal cord injured patients was compared to that of using a gel mattress, and stratified analyses were performed on patients with complete tetraplegia and paraplegia. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected from 315 patients admitted in a level-I trauma centre following a spinal cord injury between April 2010 and March 2016. Upon arrival to the emergency room and until surgery, patients were transferred on a foam stretcher pad with a viscoelastic polymer gel mattress (before 1 October 2014) or received a multi-layer foam dressing applied to their sacral-coccygeal area (after 1 October 2014). The occurrence of sacral pressure ulcer during acute hospitalisation was similar irrespective of whether patients received the dressing or the gel mattress. It was found that 82% of patients with complete tetraplegia receiving the preventive dressing developed sacral ulcers as compared to only 36% of patients using the gel mattress. Although multi-layer dressings were suggested to improve skin protection and decrease pressure ulcer occurrence in critically ill patients, such preventive dressings are not superior to gel mattresses in spinal cord injured patients and should be used with precaution, especially in complete tetraplegia.

AB  - Abstract:? We tested the independent utility of ?-amyloid precursor protein (?-APP) immunohistochemical staining as evidence of brain trauma in the deaths of young children. Blinded reviewers retrospectively reviewed immunostained brain tissues from homicidal deaths, age-matched control cases without evidence of trauma, as well as cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The reviewers correctly identified five of the seven cases with documented inflicted head trauma. However, one of seven age-matched control cases and one of 10 SIDS/sudden unexplained death in infancy (SUDI) cases demonstrated staining patterns similar to those seen in cases of inflicted trauma. We discuss these cases and the circumstances surrounding them with the intent to explain the difficulties associated with immunohistological interpretation of axonal injury. Although the utility of ?-APP is quite powerful if not confounded by global hypoxic-ischemic injury, ultimately, ?-APP studies should be only one piece of information in the determination of cause and manner of death.

AB  - Background:? The aims of this cohort study were to assess the survival of trauma patients treated in a general intensive care unit (ICU) and to evaluate the simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II, maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, injury severity score (ISS), age, sex and severe head injury as predictors of 30-day mortality. Methods:? Three hundred and twenty-five adult patients admitted during 1998?2003 were evaluated retrospectively with update of survival data in January 2005. Kaplan?Meier statistics and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to study survival and to assess predictors of mortality, respectively. Results:? The 30-day mortality was 16.9%, ICU mortality 13.8% and hospital mortality 17.8%. Long-term survival (observation time, 1?7 years) was 77.8%. After 3.5 years, mortality was the same as for the background population. Severe head injury was the main cause of death and increased the risk of 30-day mortality 2.4-fold. In addition, SAPS II and an age above 50 years proved to be significant predictors of mortality in a multivariate analysis. Sex was not associated with mortality, and ISS and the maximum SOFA score were significant predictors in univariate analyses only. Conclusion:? Reduced long-term survival was observed up to 3.5 years after acute injury. The 30-day mortality was strongly related to severe head injury, SAPS II and an age above 50 years. These variables may be useful as predictors of mortality, and may contribute to risk adjustment of this subset of trauma patients when treatment results from different centres are compared.

AB  - Abstract Excessive alcohol use is extremely prevalent in the United States, particularly among trauma-exposed individuals. While several studies have examined genetic influences on alcohol use and related problems, this has not been studied in the context of trauma-exposed populations. We report results from a genome-wide association study of alcohol consumption and associated problems as measured by the alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT) in a trauma-exposed cohort. Results indicate a genome-wide significant association between total AUDIT score and rs1433375 [N = 1036, P = 2.61 ? 10?8 (dominant model), P = 7.76 ? 10?8 (additive model)], an intergenic single-nucleotide polymorphism located 323 kb upstream of the sodium channel and clathrin linker 1 (SCLT1) at 4q28. rs1433375 was also significant in a meta-analysis of two similar, but independent, cohorts (N = 1394, P = 0.0004), the Marine Resiliency Study and Systems Biology PTSD Biomarkers Consortium. Functional analysis indicated that rs1433375 was associated with SCLT1 gene expression and cortical-cerebellar functional connectivity measured via resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Together, findings suggest a role for sodium channel regulation and cerebellar functioning in alcohol use behavior. Identifying mechanisms underlying risk for problematic alcohol use in trauma-exposed populations is critical for future treatment and prevention efforts.

AB  - Abstract??? Background/Aims:? The stability of immobilization devices varies from flexible to rigid, depending on the trauma. We evaluated the rigidity of various commonly used splints in vitro Material and Methods:? An acrylic resin model was used. The central incisors simulated injured teeth, with increased vertical and horizontal mobility. The lateral incisors and canines stimulated uninjured teeth. Tooth mobility was measured with the Periotest? device. Vertical and horizontal measurements were made before and after splinting, and the difference between values was defined as the splint effect. We evaluated 4 composite splints, 3 wire-composite splints, a titanium trauma splint, a titanium ring splint, a bracket splint, and 2 Schuchardt splints Results:? For all injured teeth and all splints, there was a significant splint effect for the vertical and horizontal dimensions (P?<?0.05). For injured teeth, the composite splints produced the largest changes in vertical tooth mobility; wire-composite splints 1 and 2, using orthodontic wires, produced the smallest vertical splint effects. For uninjured teeth, the Schuchardt 1 splint and the bracket splint produced the largest splint effects; wire-composite splints 1 and 2 produced only a slight change in tooth mobility. Composite splints 2 and 3 produced the largest horizontal splint effects for injured teeth, and the 4 composite splints produced the largest horizontal splint effects for uninjured teeth. The most horizontally flexible splints were the titanium trauma splint and wire-composite splints 1 and 2. Conclusions:? According to the current guidelines and within the limits of an in vitro study, it can be stated that flexible or semirigid splints such as the titanium trauma splint and wire-composite splints 1 and 2 are appropriate for splinting teeth with dislocation injuries and root fractures, whereas rigid splints such as wire-composite splint 3 and the titanium ring splint can be used to treat alveolar process fractures.

AB  - Abstract??? Dental trauma is an irreversible pathology which after occurrence is characterized by life long debilitating effects. The objective of the study was to measure the prevalence of trauma in anterior permanent teeth among children and associations with independent variables. A total of 453 5th and 6th grade Arab Eastern Jerusalem schoolchildren participated. Trauma, incisal overjet and lip competence were measured by one examiner in the schools. Reasons and location of trauma were assessed by telephone interviews with the parents. The total prevalence of dental trauma was 33.8%. Severe trauma prevalence (involving dentine) was 12.6%. Severe trauma was more prevalent among boys (OR?=?2.03, P?=?0.026); children with lip incompetence (OR?=?2.71, P?=?0.001); and those with an overjet of 4mm or more (OR?=?3.73, P?<?0.001). The main reported causes for dental trauma were falling (29.1%), sports (16.4%), violence (20%) and playing (20%). According to the parents? reports, more fall-related injuries were reported at home, more sport injuries at school, more ?playing? injuries ?outside? (P?<?0.001). Combination of results with a previous study among Jewish schoolchildren demonstrated: severe dental trauma was related to overjet (OR?=?1.73, P?=?0.002), lip incompetence (OR?=?2.19, P?<?0.001), gender (OR for males?=?1.54, P?=?0.005), but not to ethnicity (Arab or Jewish). The reasons for trauma observed in this study were potentially preventable. A community effort should therefore be pursued, with the aim of educating sports teachers, teachers, health personnel and schoolchildren regarding awareness of dental trauma prevention, with emphasis on utilizing mouthguards and early orthodontic intervention, when financially possible.

AB  - In recent years, a range of counselling and psychotherapy interventions have been developed in work with clients and patients suffering from the psychological effects of trauma. This paper outlines various theoretical models of psychological trauma, selected because they can specifically encompass both the external aetiology (i.e. the traumatic event) and also explain (to a greater or lesser extent) the enormous range of reactions to that event. These models are critically discussed in terms of their implications for counselling practice, and as guides to further research. Examples are given of ways in which the author has drawn on different theoretical frameworks to inform her own therapeutic practice in work with people experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder.

AB  - ABSTRACT Adversity early in life can disrupt the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes and increase risk for negative health outcomes. The interplay between these axes and the environment is complex, and understanding needs to be advanced by the investigation of the multiple hormonal relationships underlying these processes. The current study examined basal hormonal associations between morning levels of cortisol, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone in a cohort of adolescents (mean age 15.56 years). The moderating influence of childhood adversity was also examined, as indexed by self-reported trauma (at mean age 14.91), and observed maternal aggressive parenting (at mean age 12.41). Between-person regressions revealed significant associations between hormones that were moderated by both measures of adversity. In females, all hormones positively covaried, but also interacted with adversity, such that positive covariation was typically only present when levels of trauma and/or aggressive parenting were low. In males, hormonal associations and interactions were less evident; however, interactions were detected for cortisol-testosterone ? positively covarying at high levels of aggressive parenting but negatively covarying at low levels ? and DHEA-cortisol ? similarly positively covarying at high levels of parental aggression. These results demonstrate associations between adrenal and gonadal hormones and the moderating role of adversity, which is likely driven by feedback mechanisms, or cross-talk, between the axes. These findings suggest that hormonal changes may be the pathway through which early life adversity alters physiology and increases health risks, but does so differentially in the sexes; however further study is necessary to establish causation. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
