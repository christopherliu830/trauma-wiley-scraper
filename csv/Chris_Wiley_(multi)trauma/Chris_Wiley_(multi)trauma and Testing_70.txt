AB  - Objectives To evaluate relationships between heart rate and clinical variables in healthy dogs and dogs examined at a referral hospital. Methods Clinical data were extracted from the electronic patient records of a first opinion group (5000 healthy dogs) and a referral hospital (5849 dogs). Univariable and multi-variable general linear models were used to assess associations between heart rate and clinical characteristics. Separate multi-variable models were constructed for first opinion and referral populations. Results In healthy dogs, heart rate was negatively associated with bodyweight (P<0·001) but was higher in Chihuahuas. The mean difference in heart rate between a 5 and 55?kg dog was 10·5 beats per minute. In dogs presenting to a referral hospital, heart rate was negatively associated with bodyweight (P<0·001) and the following breeds; border collie, golden retriever, Labrador retriever, springer spaniel and West Highland white terrier and positively associated with age, admitting service (emergency and critical care, emergency first opinion and cardiology) and the following breeds; Cavalier King Charles spaniel, Staffordshire bull terrier and Yorkshire terrier. Clinical Significance Bodyweight, age, breed and disease status all influence heart rate in dogs, although these factors account for a relatively small proportion of the overall variability in heart rate.

AB  - SYNOPSISThis study attempts to replicate and synthesize previous headache/MMPI research by investigating scale differences amongst diagnoses and between a control group; re-examining the occurrence of the conversion ?V? pattern; evaluating the Kudrow-Sutkus (1979) classification system; measuring score changes which occur with prognosis; and observing the effect that ?headache items? have on scale score elevations. Several mean scale scores differed from previous studies. A number of these differences were clinically significant. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) (sex [370 males and females] and headache diagnosis) for each scale determined that males had higher L scores; the control group had higher K scores than post trauma, mixed, or vascular patients; each headache diagnosis had higher 1, 2, 3, and 7 scores than the control group (scales 1, 2, and 3 were clinically elevated in only the post trauma and mixed conditions); scale 9 scores varied between conditions; and scale 10 scores were higher for migraine, mixed, cluster, and post trauma patients. Chi-square analysis determined that the conversion ?;V? pattern occurred in a significantly greater degree in headache patients. However, the percentage of occurrence ranged from only 12.50 to 31.03 percent. The Kudrow-Sutkus system correctly diagnosed only 40.08 percent of 90 randomly selected subjects. One-way ANOVA determined that no significant change occurred in group scale scores in 20 headache sufferers who received treatment ranging from a multi-disciplinary hospital program to none at all and whose prognosis ranged from excellent to poor. One-way ANOVA determined that the removal of items which inquire about ?headache symptoms? produced significant reductions on scales 1 and 3.The inability of this study to replicate previous empirical investigations raises questions of the MMPI's reliability as a diagnostic classifier in chronic headache. Certain elevations on the MMPI may be the result of symptom measurement and not psychopathology.

AB  - Background Far West New South Wales Local Emergency Management Committee runs an annual crash simulation exercise to assess the operational readiness of all local emergency services to coordinate and manage a multi-casualty exercise. Context Since 2009, the Broken Hill University Department of Rural Health (BHUDRH) has collaborated with the committee, enabling the inclusion of health students in this exercise. It is an immersive interprofessional learning experience that evaluates teamwork, communication and safe effective clinical trauma management outside the hospital setting. Innovation After 7 years of modifying and developing the exercise, we set out to evaluate its impact on the students? learning, and sought ethics approval from the University of Sydney for this study. At the start of this year's crash simulation, students were given information sheets and consent forms with regards to the research. Once formal debriefing had finished, the researchers conducted a semi-structured focus-group interview with the health students to gain insight into their experience and their perceived value of the training. Students also completed short-answer questionnaires, and the anonymised responses were analysed. Crash simulation ? evaluates teamwork, communication and safe effective clinical trauma management Implications Participants identified that this multidisciplinary learning opportunity in a pre-hospital mass casualty situation was of value to them. It has taken them outside of their usually protected hospital or primary care setting and tested their critical thinking and communication skills. We recommend this learning concept to other educational institutions. Further research will assess the learning value of the simulated event to the other agencies involved.

AB  - Abstract Clinically, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have been used in treatment of many diseases, but the local oxidative stress (OS) of lesion severely limits the survival of BMSCs, which reduces the efficacy of BMSCs transplantation. Therefore, enhancing the anti-OS stress ability of BMSCs is a key breakthrough point. Preconditioning is a common protective mechanism for cells or body. Here, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of OS preconditioning on the anti-OS ability of BMSCs and its mechanism. Fortunately, OS preconditioning can increase the expression of superoxide dismutase, catalase, NQO1, and heme oxygenase 1 through the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 pathway, thereby decreased the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, relieved the damage of ROS to mitochondria, DNA and cell membrane, enhanced the anti-OS ability of BMSCs, and promoted the survival of BMSCs under OS.

AB  - Our review aimed to answer the question of whether exposure to PPD in the European standard series could lead to subsequent sensitisation in a significant number of patients. We aimed to achieve this by comparing the frequency of PPD sensitivity in patients who had never been patch tested compared to those who were having repeat patch testing and who therefore had been exposed to PPD in patch test conditions. From January 1990 to December 1999 14,001 patient?s with suspected contact dermatitis were tested with the European standard series in St. Johns. We selected and obtained the records of all patient?s during this time period who had a positive patch test to PPD free base 1% pet. Of the 14,001 patient?s tested, 1035 had previously been patch tested on at least one occasion representing 7.4% of the population. This proportion varied from 5.6% in 1994 to 11.1% in 1991 but there was no obvious trend during the ten year period. The total number of PPD positive reactions (+ to +++) over the ten year period in the whole population was 449 (3.2%). The number of PPD positive reactions in the first time testers was 419 (3.2%) compared to 30 (2.9)% in the repeat testers. Our figures over a ten-year period do not show an increase in the rate of PPD sensitivity in patients who have been previously patch tested. These figures suggest that PPD 1% pet. as used in the standard series is not actively sensitising patients who are repeatedly patch tested.

AB  - Summary Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) affects an estimated 98,400 individuals in the UK, including 21900 who are infected but remain undiagnosed (1). The prevalence of HIV is increasing worldwide, in part due to ongoing transmission and more widespread testing, but also as a consequence of the improved life expectancy which highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has brought. Despite the dramatic reduction in the overall incidence of opportunistic infections in the post-HAART era, there is still significant morbidity and mortality associated with late diagnosis. Late diagnosis (defined as CD4 count <350 cells/mm3 at diagnosis) accounts for approximately 50% of new diagnosis in UK and Europe (1). Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are extremely common amongst individuals living with HIV - the reasons for which are likely to be multi-factorial. Patients may experience GI side effects as a result of antiretroviral therapy or other drugs used to treat HIV-related complications. They may develop opportunistic infections affecting any part of the GI tract from mouth to anus, related to their degree of immuno-compromise. Finally, their epidemiological risk group may place them at increased risk of certain diseases e.g. viral hepatitis in injecting drug users, lymphogranuloma venereum in men having sex with men (MSM). It is therefore important for GI physicians to have an awareness of the various manifestations of GI disease in HIV positive patients in order to help formulate a differential diagnosis and guide investigation in those with known infection (Table 1). Recognizing the association between specific conditions and HIV/AIDS may prompt testing by GI physicians and provide a valuable opportunity to diagnose HIV earlier resulting in better clinical outcome.

AB  - Abstract A biogeographic estimate of a certain population can not only discern population substructure in the whole genome association study, but also provide informative clues for forensic investigations when obtained DNA genotypes do not find a match in the available forensic DNA database. In this study, 100 ancestry informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (AISNPs) were first presented to differentiate three continental ancestries (African, East Asian and European). Ultimately, forty-two AISNPs were chosen from the 100 AISNPs. Distinguishing power of the 100 and 42 AISNPs for differentiating continental populations was further evaluated with population cluster analyses. Results indicated both of AISNP sets could efficiently differentiate 11 training populations from the three continents. Further validation of 42 AISNPs in testing population set indicated these 42 AISNPs performed well for ancestry inferences of these testing individuals. Ancestry components of Uyghur group were assessed by comparing with different continental populations based on these 42 AISNPs. Results revealed that East Asian populations contributed more ancestry components to the studied Uyghur group than European populations. In conclusion, our study is expected to provide more AISNP markers and enrich extant reference database.

AB  - Abstract ?-Secretase is an aspartyl protease composed of four proteins: presenilin (PS), nicastrin (Nct), APH1, and PEN2. These proteins assemble into a membrane complex that cleaves a variety of substrates within the transmembrane domain. The ?-secretase cleavage products play an important role in various biological processes such as embryonic development and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The major role of ?-secretase in brain pathology has been linked to AD and to the production of the amyloid ?-peptide. However, little is known about the possible role of ?-secretase following acute brain insult. Here we examined by immunostaining the expression patterns of two ?-secretase components, PS1 and Nct, in three paradigms of brain insult in mice: closed head injury, intracerebroventricular injection of LPS, and brain stabbing. Our results show that in naïve and sham-injured brains expression of PS1 and Nct is restricted mainly to neurons. However, following insult, the expression of both proteins is also observed in nonneuronal cells, consisting of activated astrocytes and microglia. Furthermore, the proteins are coexpressed within the same astrocytes and microglia, implying that these cells exhibit an enhanced ?-secretase activity following brain damage. In view of the important role played by astrocytes and microglia in brain disorders, our findings suggest that ?-secretase may participate in brain damage and repair processes by regulating astrocyte and microglia activation and/or function. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Background There has been little research on the perioperative D-dimer levels in oesophageal cancer patients. Plasma D-dimer levels can be used to predict the outcome in cancer patients. Methods A cancer group of 66 oesophageal cancer patients and a control group of 12 patients with benign disease were enrolled in this cohort study. The plasma D-dimer levels during the pre-operation and 3rd and 9th day post-operation periods were prospectively examined and analysed between the two groups. Plasma D-dimer levels were also compared with the clinicopathological characteristics and 3-year survival of the oesophageal cancer patients. Results Plasma D-dimer levels increased in both groups after surgery, but they were significantly higher in the cancer group. In oesophageal cancer patients, pre-operation plasma D-dimer levels were significantly higher in TNM stage IV patients. Perioperative plasma D-dimer levels significantly increased after surgery, and the survival was shortened in those patients whose D-dimer levels on the 3rd and 9th post-operative day above the median. In addition, increased plasma D-dimer levels at the 3rd and 9th days after surgery were influenced by the patient's age. Conclusion In oesophageal cancer patients, D-dimer levels increased after surgery, and the increases were associated with poor outcomes. J. Surg. Oncol. 2013 108:34?41. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Safety and efficacy of two manual toothbrushes. Abstract:? Objective:? The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy and safety of a newly designed multi-level manual toothbrush (Profit-Haije-Brush) compared with a control flat-trimmed manual reference toothbrush from the American Dental Association (ADA). Material and methods:? For this study, 36 healthy subjects without previous experience in the use of the Profit-Haije-Brush (PHB) were selected. Subjects were given a period of 2?weeks to become familiar with both types of brushes and were instructed to use them on alternate days for 2?min twice daily. Prior to their visit, subjects refrained from all oral hygiene procedures for 48?h. Prebrushing plaque and gingival abrasion scores were assessed. Subsequently, two randomly chosen contra-lateral quadrants were brushed with one of both brushes and the other two quadrants with the alternate brush. Subjects were supervised during their 2-min brushing exercise. After brushing, plaque and gingival abrasion were re-assessed. A questionnaire was filled out to investigate the subjects? attitudes towards both brushes. Results:? The overall mean prebrushing PI was 2.47 for the PHB and 2.44 for the ADA. The reduction in PI was 1.32 and 1.23 respectively (P?<?0.05). With regard to gingival abrasion the overall mean prebrushing scores were 4.57 (PHB) and 5.34 (ADA). Post-brushing scores were 13.49 and 13.77 for the PHB and ADA respectively. Conclusion:? Statistically, the multi-level PHB was significantly more efficacious than the flat-trimmed ADA. However, the difference is clinically considered small and the amount of remaining plaque was not significantly different between brushes. No greater potential to cause gingival abrasion to the oral tissues was observed.

AB  - Abstract Objective In order to optimize psycho-oncologic care for patients with severe stressor-related symptomatology, we aimed to provide (a) valid and generalizable prevalence rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in oncological patients and (b) the percentage of PTSD cases elicited by cancer-related events. Methods This multi-center study was based on a representative sample of patients across cancer types. A diagnostic interview (CIDI-O) was used to assess PTSD according to DSM-IV. We first describe type and frequency of potentially traumatic events (A1-events) and the degree to which they meet the trauma criteria (A2-events). Subsequently, we present adjusted prevalence rates of PTSD and explore the proportion of patients with cancer-related PTSD. Results Four thousand twenty patients participated (response rate: 68 %), and 2141 completed the diagnostic interview; 1641 patients reported at least one A1-event, of whom 16% (n = 257) reported cancer-related events. Ninety-one percent (n = 232) of theses cancer-related events qualified as A2-events. Across cancer types, the adjusted 4-week prevalence of PTSD was 2.0% (95% CI, 1.5-2.7); 9% (n = 5) of the 4-week PTSD cases were cancer-related. Conclusions Across cancer types and treatment settings, few cancer patients fulfilled diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Of those, a mere fraction was attributable to cancer-related events. These robust findings should be taken into account in both research and practice to develop and provide adequate care for cancer patients with severe stressor-related symptomatology.

AB  - ABSTRACT The ability to form biofilm on the surface of implanted devices is often considered the most critical virulence factor possessed by Staphylococcus epidermidis in its role as an opportunistic pathogen in orthopaedic device-related infection (ODRI). Despite this recognition, there is a lack of clinical evidence linking outcome with biofilm forming ability for S. epidermidis ODRIs. We prospectively collected S. epidermidis isolates cultured from patients presenting with ODRI. Antibiotic resistance patterns and biofilm-forming ability was assessed. Patient information was collected and treatment outcome measures were determined after a mean follow-up period of 26 months. The primary outcome measure was cure at follow-up. Univariate logistic regression models were used to determine the influence of biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance on treatment outcome. A total of 124 patients were included in the study, a majority of whom (n?=?90) involved infections of the lower extremity. A clear trend emerged in the lower extremity cohort whereby cure rates decreased as the biofilm-forming ability of the isolates increased (84% cure rate for infections caused by non-biofilm formers, 76% cure rate for weak biofilm-formers, and 60% cure rate for the most marked biofilm formers, p?=?0.076). Antibiotic resistance did not influence treatment cure rate. Chronic immunosuppression was associated with a statistically significant decrease in cure rate (p?=?0.044). Clinical significance: The trend of increasing biofilm-forming ability resulting in lower cure rates for S. epidermidis ODRI indicates biofilm-forming ability of infecting pathogens does influence treatment outcome of infections of the lower extremity. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract L1 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules that is associated with axonal growth, including formation of the corticospinal tract (CST). The present study describes the effects of L1 deletion on hindlimb function in locomotion, and examines the role of L1 in recovery and remodeling after contusive spinal cord injury (SCI) in mice. Uninjured adult L1 knockout (Y/?) mice had impaired performance on locomotor tests compared with their wild-type littermates (Y/+). Anterograde tracing demonstrated that CST axons project to thoracic, but not lumbar, levels of the spinal cord of Y/? mice, and revealed a diversion of these fibers from their position in the base of the dorsal columns. Retrograde tracing also revealed reduced numbers of descending projections from paraventricular hypothalamus and red nuclei to the lumbar spinal cord in Y/? mice. SCI at the mid-thoracic level produced a lesion encompassing the center of the spinal cord, including the site of the dorsal CST and surrounding gray matter (GM). The injury caused lasting deficits in fine aspects of locomotion. There was no effect of genotype on final lesion size or the growth of axons into the lesion area. However, injured Y/? mice demonstrated a robust expansion of CST projections throughout the GM of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord rostral to the lesion compared with Y/+ littermates. Thus, L1 is important for the development of multiple spinal projections and also contributes to the restriction of CST sprouting rostral to the site of a SCI in adults.

AB  - Abstract Background Major surgery comes with a high risk for postoperative inflammatory complications. Preoperative risk scores predict mortality risk but fail to identify patients at risk for complications following cardiovascular surgery. We therefore assessed the value of preoperative red cell distribution width (RDW) as a predictor for pneumonia and sepsis after cardiovascular surgery and studied the relation of RDW with hematopoietic tissue activity. Methods RDW is an easily accessible, yet seldomly used parameter from routine haematology measurements. RDW was extracted from the Utrecht Patient Orientated Database (UPOD) for preoperative measurements in patients undergoing open abdominal aortic anuerysm repair (AAA)(N = 136) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)(N = 2193). The cohorts were stratified in tertiles to assess effects over the different groups. Generalized Linear Models were used to determine associations between RDW and postoperative inflammatory complications. Hematopoietic tissue activity was scored using fluor-18-(18F)-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography and associated with RDW using linear regression models. Results In total, 43(31.6%) and 73 patients (3.3%) suffered from inflammatory complications after AAA-repair or CABG, respectively; the majority being pneumonia in both cohorts. Postoperative inflammatory outcome incidence increased from 19.6% in the lowest to 48.9% in the highest RDW tertile with a corresponding risk ratio (RR) of 2.35 ([95%CI:1.08-5.14] P = 0.032) in AAA patients. In the CABG cohort, the incidence of postoperative inflammatory outcomes increased from 1.8% to 5.3% with an adjusted RR of 1.95 ([95%CI:1.02-3.75] P = 0.044) for the highest RDW tertile compared with the lowest RDW tertile. FDG-PET scans showed associations of RDW with tissue activity in the spleen (B = 0.517 [P = 0.001]) and the lumbar bone marrow (B = 0.480 [P = 0.004]). Conclusion Elevated RDW associates with increased risk for postoperative inflammatory complications and hematopoietic tissue activity. RDW likely reflects chronic low-grade inflammation and should be considered to identify patients at risk for postoperative inflammatory complications following cardiovascular surgery.

AB  - Summary This chapter first briefly talks about leg ulcers, which are the most common chronic wounds in developed countries affecting 1?3% of the British population. It then discusses lower limb trauma. The annual incidence of open lower limb fractures is approximately 5 per 100,000 population. Most common mechanisms of injury include: (i) Fall from height; (ii) Motor vehicle collision; and (iii) Interpersonal violence. A brief discussion of osteomyelitis, which is inflammation of bone caused by an infecting organism, is then presented. The discussion includes classification, mechanism of infection, pathology, investigation and treatment. The chapter also describes the pathogenesis, classification, staging, clinical diagnosis, and surgical management of lymphoedema. Finally it presents a brief discussion of pressure ulcers.

AB  - Abstract The impact of trauma experiences on neurodevelopment (child development in general) appears to be a central component in understanding the etiology of sexual behavior problems and therefore is a key area to address in the treatment of these problems. Research from the National Child Traumatic Stress Network identified the seven most frequent types of developmental insults that contribute to behavioral difficulties in children. These developmental insults are emotional abuse, the loss of important relationships, impaired caregivers, exposure to domestic violence, sexual abuse, neglect, and physical abuse. This chapter suggests that at least five of these 'developmental insults' directly involve disruptions in early attachment relationships and that depending on the circumstances, all seven of these experiences may directly involve the nature of the parent-child interaction and the attachment relationship. Emotional and behavioral regulation, promoted by a sense of safety and parental engagement, are important developmental foundations for pro-social functioning.

AB  - Abstract Hemocompatible materials for extracorporeal life support (ECLS) technology are investigated to mitigate thrombotic complications associated with this therapy. A promising solution is an omniphobic bilayer coating, tethered liquid perfluorocarbon (TLP), which utilizes an immobilized tether to anchor a mobile, liquid surface lubricant that prevents adhesion of blood components to the substrate. In this study, we investigated the effects of TLP on real-time clot formation using thromboelastography (TEG). TLP was applied to TEG cups, utilizing perfluorodecalin (PFD) or FluorLube63 as the liquid layer, and compared to uncoated cups. Human blood (n = 10) was added to cups; and TEG parameters (R, K, α-angle, MA, LY30, LY60) and adherent thrombus weight were assessed. TLP decreased clot amplification (α-angle), clot strength (MA), and adherent clot weight (p?<?.0001). These effects were greater with FluorLube63 versus PFD (α-angle p?<?.0001; MA p = .0019; clot weight p?<?.0001). Reaction time (R) was longer in TLP-coated cups versus control cups with liquid lubricant added (p = .0377). Percent fibrinolysis (LY30 and LY60) was greater in the TLP versus controls at LY30 (p?<?.0001), and in FluoroLube63 versus controls at LY60 (p = .0021). TLP significantly altered clot formation, exerting antithrombogenic effects. This reduction in surface thrombogenicity supports TLP as a candidate for improved biocompatibility of ECLS materials, pending further validation with exposure to shear stress.

AB  - Abstract The concept that the mammalian glycoprotein vitronectin acts as a biological ?glue? and key controller of mammalian tissue repair and remodelling activity is emerging from nearly 50 years of experimental in vitro and in vivo data. Unexpectedly, the vitronectin-knockout (VN-KO) mouse was found to be viable and to have largely normal phenotype. However, diligent observation revealed that the VN-KO animal exhibits delayed coagulation and poor wound healing. This is interpreted to indicate that VN occupies a role in the earliest events of thrombogenesis and tissue repair. VN is the foundation upon which the thrombus grows in an organised structure. In addition to sealing the wound, the thrombus also serves to protect the underlying tissue from oxidation, is a reservoir of mitogens and tissue repair mediators, and provides a provisional scaffold for the repairing tissue. In the absence of VN (e.g., VN-KO animal), this cascade is disrupted before it begins. A wide variety of biologically active species associate with VN. Although initial studies were focused on mitogens, other classes of bioactives (e.g., glycosaminoglycans and metalloproteinases) are now also known to specifically interact with VN. Although some interactions are transient, others are long-lived and often result in multi-protein complexes. Multi-protein complexes provide several advantages: prolonging molecular interactions, sustaining local concentrations, facilitating co-stimulation of cell surface receptors and thereby enhancing cellular/biological responses. We contend that these, or equivalent, multi-protein complexes facilitate VN polyfunctionality in vivo. It is also likely that many of the species demonstrated to associate with VN in vitro, also associate with VN in vivo in similar multi-protein complexes. Thus, the predominant biological function of VN is that of a master controller of the extracellular environment; informing, and possibly instructing cells ?where? to behave, ?when? to behave and ?how? to behave (i.e., appropriately for the current circumstance). ? 2013 IUBMB Life, 65(10):807-818, 2013

AB  - Summary A 5-year-old Rheinlander gelding was evaluated for left hindlimb stifle lameness. The lameness was localised to the stifle, but source of the lameness was not specifically diagnosed from the physical, radiographic and ultrasonographic examinations. Computed tomography (CT) and CT arthrography were therefore used for further investigation since these imaging techniques image bony structures, cartilage and soft tissues. This examination showed multiple lesions in the stifle: an osteochondrosis dissecans like lesion of the medial femoral condyle, bony fragments, cartilage trauma and caudal cruciate ligament injury. The prognosis for continuing use as a sports horse was regarded as unfavourable. Therefore, the horse was subjected to euthanasia. All CT findings were confirmed by gross pathology. The CT and CT arthrography examination in this case provided a diagnosis not achieved with other conventional imaging techniques.
