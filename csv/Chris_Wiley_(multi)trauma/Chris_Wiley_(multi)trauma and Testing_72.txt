AB  - Summary This chapter presents various eye diseases of the goat, such as blindness, cyclopia, tumours of the eyelids, and mycoplasma. There is strong evidence that Mycoplasma conjunctivae is a major causal agent of keratoconjunctivitis in the United Kingdom. Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) can cause a mucopurulent conjunctivitis in goats. The cornea of goats is commonly traumatised, often by stalks of hay or straw; overlarge tags on the ears of Angora kids may irritate the eye and the eye will also be damaged when entropion is present. Treatment involves correcting or removing the cause of the trauma and then treating the resultant conjunctivitis or corneal damage. Photosensitisation from whatever cause will affect the head, resulting in swelling of unpigmented skin of the muzzle, drooping ears, and swollen eyelids. Affected animals should be removed from exposure to sunlight and any possible photosensitising substance.

AB  - Synopsis Bacillus cereus is ubiquitous in nature and thus occurs naturally in a wide range of raw materials and foodstuffs. B. cereus spores are resistant to desiccation and heat and able to survive dry storage and cooking. Vegetative cells produce several toxins which on ingestion in sufficient numbers can cause vomiting and/or diarrhoea depending on the toxins produced. Gastrointestinal disease is commonly associated with reheated or inadequately cooked foods. In addition to being a rare cause of several acute infections (e.g. pneumonia and septicaemia), B. cereus can also cause localized infection of post-surgical or trauma wounds and is a rare but significant pathogen of the eye where it may result in severe endophthalmitis often leading to loss of vision. Key risk factors in such cases are trauma to the eye and retained contaminated intraocular foreign bodies. In addition, rare cases of B. cereus-associated keratitis (inflammation of the cornea) have been linked to contact lens use. Bacillus cereus is therefore a microbial contaminant that could adversely affect product safety of cosmetic and facial toiletries and pose a threat to the user if other key risk factors are also present. The infective dose in the human eye is unknown, but as few as 100 cfu has been reported to initiate infection in a susceptible animal model. However, we are not aware of any reports in the literature of B. cereus infections in any body site linked with use of personal care products. Low levels of B. cereus spores may on occasion be present in near-eye cosmetics, and these products have been used by consumers for many years. In addition, exposure to B. cereus is more likely to occur through other routes (e.g. dustborne contamination) due to its ubiquity and resistance properties of spores. The organism has been recovered from the eyes of healthy individuals. Therefore, although there may be a perceived hazard, the risk of severe eye infections as a consequence of exposure through contaminated near-eye cosmetics is judged to be vanishingly small. It is unlikely that more stringent microbiological standards for near-eye cosmetics will have any impact on the risk of severe eye infections caused by B. cereus, as these are not linked to use of personal care products.

AB  - Introduction? Trauma teams and cardiac arrest teams provide an urgent and expert multi-disciplinary response to time critical emergencies. The present study documents the contribution of a medical emergency team (MET) to managing non-trauma surgical emergencies. Materials and Methods? Data was prospectively collected over a two year period concerning the contribution of medical emergency teams to the resuscitation of all patients with non-trauma surgical emergencies and altered vital signs in hospital wards. Results? Over the study period, the details of 19 patients with surgical emergencies were recorded. 63% of emergencies occurred outside of normal working hours. In 53% of cases, the surgical registrar was off-site or physically unavailable to attend the emergency immediately. In 11% of cases, the medical emergency team was activated prior to the arrival of the surgical registrar. In 26% of cases, the patient was left unattended whilst awaiting arrival of the surgical registrar. The medical emergency team provided resuscitation procedures and arranged urgent investigations in all patients, physically transported the patient to the operating theatre in 16% of patients and prepared for general anaesthetic in the operating theatre in 11% of cases. The surgical registrar complemented the medical emergency team response by liaising with consultant surgeons, anaesthetists and operating theatre staff in all cases. All patients received definitive treatment within 30 minutes of MET response. Conclusion? Routine use of medical emergency teams in the initial resuscitation of patients with surgical emergencies expedites definitive management.

AB  - Abstract There is increasing evidence that titanium ions are released from orthopedic implants by biocorrosion. The aim of this study was to investigate titanium uptake by human T-lymphocytes and its effects on phenotype and proliferation. Freshly isolated human nonadherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells (NA-PBMC), were exposed to TiCl4 [Ti(IV)]. Bioavailability and distribution of Ti(IV) in T-lymphocytes was determined by energy-filtered electron microscopy (EFTEM). The effects of Ti(IV) challenge on nonactivated and PHA-activated cells were assessed by flow cytometric analysis of surface markers, RANK-L production, and proliferation assays. EFTEM colocalized Ti(IV) with phosphorus in the nucleus, ribosomes, cytoplasmic membranes, and the surface membrane of T-lymphocytes. Ti(IV) increased significantly the expression of CD69, CCR4, and RANK-L in a concentration-dependent manner. Titanium enters T-lymphocytes through a currently unknown mechanism and binds to phosphorus-rich cell structures. Titanium influences phenotype and function of T-lymphocytes, resulting in activation of a CD69+ and CCR4+ T-lymphocyte population and secretion of RANK-L. These results strongly suggest the involvement of titanium ions challenged T-lymphocytes in the complex pathophysiological mechanisms of aseptic loosening of orthopedic implants. ? 2009 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Aims To estimate the influence of non-medical use of prescription opioids (NMUPO) on heroin initiation among US veterans receiving medical care. Design Using a multivariable Cox regression model, we analyzed data from a prospective, multi-site, observational study of HIV-infected and an age/race/site-matched control group of HIV-uninfected veterans in care in the United States. Approximately annual behavioral assessments were conducted and contained self-reported measures of NMUPO and heroin use. Setting Veterans Health Administration (VHA) infectious disease and primary care clinics in Atlanta, Baltimore, New York, Houston, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and Washington, DC. Participants A total of 3396 HIV-infected and uninfected patients enrolled into the Veterans Aging Cohort Study who reported no life-time NMUPO or heroin use, had no opioid use disorder diagnoses at baseline and who were followed between 2002 and 2012. Measurements The primary outcome measure was self-reported incident heroin use and the primary exposure of interest was new-onset NMUPO. Our final model was adjusted for socio-demographics, pain interference, prior diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder and/or depression and self-reported other substance use. Findings Using a multivariable Cox regression model, we found that non-medical use of prescription opioids NMUPO was associated positively and independently with heroin initiation [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 5.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.01, 7.35]. Conclusions New-onset non-medical use of prescription opioids (NMUPO) is a strong risk factor for heroin initiation among HIV-infected and uninfected veterans in the United States who reported no previous history of NMUPO or illicit opioid use.

AB  - Objectives: The present study investigated the specificity of autobiographical memories among depressed and non-depressed borderline patients, compared with depressed patients and controls. The influence of childhood trauma, intrusions of traumatic events, avoidance of intrusions, dissociation and depression on memory specificity was also studied. Method: The Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT), a trauma interview and self-report measures of intrusions, avoidance, depression and dissociation were administered to 83 borderline outpatients, 26 depressed outpatients and 30 controls. Results: Depressed borderline patients and depressed patients reported fewer specific memories than controls. Depressed patients generated fewer specific memories than non-depressed borderline patients. Neither trauma nor traumatic intrusions, avoidance of intrusions or dissociation were related to the specificity of memories. Level of depressive symptoms (BDI) was also not related, but the presence of a depression was. Conclusion: In this large sample of outpatients with borderline personality disorder, only the subgroup with a co-morbid diagnosis of depression had trouble remembering specific events from the past. Trauma, intrusions, avoidance of intrusions and dissociation seem to be unrelated to the specificity of autobiographical memories in borderline personality disorder.

AB  - Summary. An emergency medicine and trauma programme was implemented at Ben Gurion University Medical School in Israel. Clinical performance assessment of the first-year course in emergency medicine and trauma was done using a practical examination (PE). In the continuous process of critically reviewing the course objectives and assessment methods the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) was chosen, for the first time in our medical school, as a tool for course development as well as evaluation of the existing PE. Seven experimental OSCE stations were designed which covered some of the course and practical examination topics. Twenty-six first-year medical students have taken both examinations concurrently. Twenty-three students answered an attitude questionnaire regarding both examinations. Results have indicated that the OSCE provided additional and crucial information on students' deficiencies in clinical performance which were not available from the PE. Those differences were probably due to realistic OSCE station content, highly simulated set-ups, and the objectivity of the examiner, all of which have contributed to a more challenging examination, as compared to the PE. The OSCE in emergency medicine and trauma seemed to have a relatively high level of acceptance by both staff and students. In our opinion it seems that the OSCE is a better tool for first-year level final assessment in emergency medicine and trauma.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the integrity of the welded end loop on unidirectional knotless suture after transabdominal passage in a canine cadaver. Study design Ex vivo biomechanical study. Study population Four variations of unidirectional knotless suture and 1 canine cadaver. Methods Welded end loop on strands consisted of 0 Quill polydioxanone (QP; n?=?22), 0 Quill monoderm (QM; n?=?23), 2-0?V-Loc 90 (V9; n?=?12), and 2-0?V-Loc 180 (V18; n?=?12). Half of the suture strands in each group were passed percutaneously through an insufflated cadaveric body wall, and the remaining half served as intact controls. A linear testing machine was used to load the sutures to failure. Modes of and loads to failure were compared within and between suture types. Results Loads to failure did not differ between sutures passed through the body wall and their controls when the loop remained intact. Sutures V9, V18, and QM sustained higher loads to failure compared with QP. All Quill suture lines failed at the weld during testing. Thirty-three percent of QP sutures failed at the weld during initial passage through the body wall. V-Loc sutures failed at the suture?apparatus interface, within the welded loop, or a combination. Conclusion Passing suture through a cadaveric body wall did not affect the integrity of the welded end loop of any of the unidirectional knotless sutures tested here when the loop remained intact. Clinical significance Unidirectional knotless suture (V9, V18 and QM) can be safely passed through a canine body wall for use in laparoscopic procedures. The use of QP in this manner cannot be recommended.

AB  - Key points Ongoing, moderate noise exposure does not instantly damage the auditory system but may cause lasting deficits, such as elevated thresholds and accelerated ageing of the auditory system. The neuromodulatory peptide urocortin-3 (UCN3) is involved in the body's recovery from a stress response, and is also expressed in the cochlea and the auditory brainstem. Lack of UCN3 facilitates age-induced hearing loss and causes permanently elevated auditory thresholds following a single 2 h noise exposure at moderate intensities. Outer hair cell function in mice lacking UCN3 is unaffected, so that the observed auditory deficits are most likely due to inner hair cell function or central mechanisms. Highly specific, rather than ubiquitous, expression of UCN3 in the brain renders it a promising candidate for designing drugs to ameliorate stress-related auditory deficits, including recovery from acoustic trauma. Abstract Environmental acoustic noise is omnipresent in our modern society, with sound levels that are considered non-damaging still causing long-lasting or permanent changes in the auditory system. The small neuromodulatory peptide urocortin-3 (UCN3) is the endogenous ligand for corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 2 and together they are known to play an important role in stress recovery. UCN3 expression has been observed in the auditory brainstem, but its role remains unclear. Here we describe the detailed distribution of UCN3 expression in the murine auditory brainstem and provide evidence that UCN3 is expressed in the synaptic region of inner hair cells in the cochlea. We also show that mice with deficient UCN3 signalling experience premature ageing of the auditory system starting at an age of 4.7 months with significantly elevated thresholds of auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) compared to age-matched wild-type mice. Following a single, 2 h exposure to moderate (84 or 94 dB SPL) noise, UCN3-deficient mice exhibited significantly larger shifts in ABR thresholds combined with maladaptive recovery. In wild-type mice, the same noise exposure did not cause lasting changes to auditory thresholds. The presence of UCN3-expressing neurons throughout the auditory brainstem and the predisposition to hearing loss caused by preventing its normal expression suggests UCN3 as an important neuromodulatory peptide in the auditory system's response to loud sounds.

AB  - Abstract Executive Functions (EFs) development is critically affected by stress and trauma, as well as the socioeconomic context in which children grow up (Welsh, Nix, Blair, Bierman, & Nelson, 2010, Journal of Educational Psychology, 102, 43?53). Research in this field is surprisingly lacking in relation to war contexts. This study represents a first attempt at addressing this topic by evaluating EFs in Yazidi children. The Yazidi community is an ethnic and religious minority living in Iraq. From August 2014 onwards, the Yazidi community has been the target of several atrocities perpetrated by ISIS and described as genocide by the international community at large. The University of Trieste, thanks to a program financed by the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region, developed a study aimed at (a) evaluating hot and cool EFs in children living in a war context and (b) developing a specific training method to enhance hot and cool EFs in Yazidi children of preschool age (N = 53). Data related to this group of children were compared with a sample of typically developing Italian children randomly assigned to either an EFs training group (N = 55) or a passive control group (N = 51). Results indicate different baselines in EFs in Yazidi and Italian samples and a significant effect of the program on both trained groups, especially in tasks measuring hot EFs. Data are discussed in terms of hot and cool EFs in children growing in adverse environments, as well as the evaluation of educational and developmental opportunities to prevent children who survived genocide from becoming a ?lost generation?.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the development and implementation of a Pacific medical mentoring programme and to evaluate the programme after the first year. Methods The mentoring programme was adapted from Australasian College for Emergency Medicine resources and involved Australian emergency physicians mentoring Pacific Island Country doctors. Using a prospective, cross-sectional survey of all participants, researchers collected data that were analysed for content using deductive and inductive methods. Content analysis aimed to generate new concepts that could apply to different components of mentoring, and overarching themes that apply to the mentoring programme overall. Results Nineteen doctors participated in the first year of the programme; 11 mentees from three different Pacific Island Countries and eight Australasian College for Emergency Medicine Fellow mentors. The survey was completed with a 100% response rate. Five core themes were identified from the data: vital face-to-face communication (the key to effective communication); supportive personal relationship (valued and desired by mentees); motivating professional relationship (including a regional Pacific network); substantial challenges (time, distance, remote communication); and issues around the mentoring model (goal-orientation, mentor-driven, culture). Conclusions The present study suggests a new model of Pacific mentoring that recognises the centrality of the mentoring relationship, and allows for flexible communication, shared responsibility of mentors and mentees as co-drivers and a broad understanding of goals and timelines. Future programmes should incorporate funding for in-person meetings and educational opportunities to enhance contextual and cultural understanding. These lessons can inform future medical mentorship programmes across the Pacific.

Individuals were trained in cognitive functions in their homes to compensate for cognitive impairment, assisted in work activities and helped in leisure time occupations. The four people received individually adapted computers and peripheral equipment, and the environment was changed to accommodate their needs. Each person received guidance and instruction from an occupational therapist once or twice a week for 12?18 weeks. The goals for each person were achieved according to evaluation with Goal Attainment Scaling.

Computed tomography (CT) imaging, in particular, has become a useful tool in medico-legal death investigation in many forensic institutes, and has wide applications in the field of forensic odontology. This chapter will discuss the development of CT imaging, its migration into the realm of forensic practice, and current uses of this technology in the conduct of post-mortem examinations. Particular emphasis will be given to its application to odontology in the areas of age estimation, identification, trauma analysis and Disaster Victim Identification.

AB  - Abstract Objective While emergency medicine (EM) physicians treat the majority of pediatric EM (PEM) patients in the United States, little is known about their PEM experience during training. The primary objective was to characterize the pediatric case exposure and compare to established EM residency training curricula among EM residents across five U.S. residency programs. Methods We performed a multicenter medical record review of all pediatric patients (aged < 18 years) seen by the 2015 graduating resident physicians at five U.S. EM training programs. Resident-level counts of pediatric patients were measured and specific counts were classified by the 2016 Model of Clinical Practice of Emergency Medicine (MCP) and Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) diagnostic categories. We assessed variability between residents and between programs. Results A total of 36,845 children were managed by 68 residents across all programs. The median age was 6 years. The median number of patients per resident was 660 with an interquartile range of 336. The most common PECARN diagnostic categories were trauma, gastrointestinal, and respiratory disease. Thirty-two core MCP diagnoses (43% of MCP list) were not seen by at least 50% of the residents. We found statistically significant variability between programs in both PECARN diagnostic categories (p < 0.01) and MCP diagnoses (p < 0.01). Conclusion There is considerable variation in the number of pediatric patients and the diagnostic case volume seen by EM residents. The relationship between this case variability and competence upon graduation is unknown; further investigation is warranted to better inform program-specific curricula and to guide training requirements in EM.

AB  - Summary This chapter explains how to establish a dental health screening program within modern sport. Common dental diseases can manifest as tooth surface loss, dental caries, and periodontal disease, which may severely compromise the longevity and restorative status of a patient's dentition in later life. The outer surface of a tooth is a highly protective mineralized enamel layer, which covers the inner dentine structure. Saliva has a crucial role in tooth protection due to its chemical composition, and the physical and mechanical effects of saliva flow. A mouth guard is a key feature in dental trauma impact minimisation and prevention of orofacial injuries. The main rationale for screening is to identify members of the public likely to have a particular disease and to either confirm or exclude the disease. After screening completion the dental professional will need to collate the data and identify the 'at risk athletes and dentitions'.

AB  - Background In the past 15 years, there have been a substantial number of rigorous studies examining the effectiveness of various treatments for child trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although a number of review articles exist, many have focused on randomized controlled trials or specific treatment methodologies, both of which limit the ability to draw conclusions across studies and the statistical power to test the effect of particular treatment characteristics on treatment outcomes. The current study is a review and meta-analysis of 74 studies examining treatments for children exposed to violence. Methods After reviewing the literature, we examined the relationship of a variety of treatment characteristics (e.g., group or individual treatments) and sample characteristics (e.g., average age) on treatment effect sizes. Results Results indicated that individual therapies and those with exposure paradigms within a cognitive-behavioral therapy or skills-building framework show the most promise, but treatment is somewhat less effective for those with more severe symptomology and for younger children. Conclusions Future treatments should consider the developmental and social contexts that may impede treatment progress for young children and consider how best to develop the effectiveness of group interventions that can be readily delivered in settings of mass trauma.

AB  - Summary.? We conducted a review of a single institutional experience of patients with haemophilia presenting with suspected intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) who underwent computed tomographic (CT) neuro-imaging. We found that over a 9-year period (1996?2004) 43 patients with haemophilia presented 73 times with suspected ICH: 10 presented multiple times (range: 2?9 times). The median age at presentation was 3.5?years (range: 0.5?17). Preceding trauma occurred in most (62/73; 85%) episodes. ICH was confirmed in 11 of the 73 (16%) episodes in eight patients. Patients with severe haemophilia accounted for a disproportionate number of episodes of suspected (60/73; 82%) and of confirmed ICH (10/11; 91%). All ICH occurred in patients not on prophylaxis; five occurred in three inhibitor-positive patients. Altered consciousness at presentation was present in 10/11 (91%) cases of confirmed ICH but only in 5/62 (8%) (ICH-negative) episodes. The positive and negative predictive values of altered consciousness to predict/rule out an ICH was 67% and 98%, respectively. The following were associated with an increased risk of presenting with suspected ICH and of having a confirmed ICH: (i) having severe haemophilia; (ii) not being on prophylaxis; (iii) having an inhibitor; and (iv) presenting with an altered level of consciousness. Patients without any of these features may not need to undergo CT imaging when presenting with suspected ICH. Ideally a prospective study to evaluate this hypothesis should be conducted.

AB  - Microsporum canis is a pathogenic fungus that typically causes dermatophytosis in cats. This report describes a cat with a Microsporum canis infection causing invasive fungal rhinitis that extended through the hard palate, resulting in adjacent stomatitis. Treatment with itraconazole and terbinafine resolved the infection.
