AB  - Abstract Chromosomal aberrations were investigated in nuclei extracted from synovial tissue and first-passage synovial fibroblasts (P-1 SFB, 98% enrichment) or macrophages (P-1 M?) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 10). The findings were compared with those in other rheumatic diseases (osteoarthritis, n = 14; reactive arthritis, n = 1), as well as with those in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 8). Controls were paired peripheral blood lymphocytes from arthritic patients, synovial tissue or SFB/M? from joint trauma/normals (n = 9), and peripheral blood monocytes from normal donors (n = 10). GTG banding of metaphase chromosomes and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization with centromere-specific probes were used. Comparable chromosomal aberrations were observed in synovial tissue and P-1 SFB of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and reactive arthritis (polysomy 7 and aneusomies of chromosomes 4, 8, 9, 12, and 18). Notably, aneusomies of chromosomes 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and/or X were also detected in P-1 synovial M? from rheumatoid arthritis (90% of the cases), osteoarthritis (93%), and reactive arthritis (1/1), as well as bronchial M? from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (25%). No aberrations were detected in paired peripheral blood lymphocytes (except for one osteoarthritis case with a karyotype 45,X[10]/46,XX[17]), or in peripheral blood monocytes and synovial tissue of normals/joint trauma. Because M? aberrations were common to chronic joint and pulmonary disease, chronic inflammatory stress may induce chromosomal aberrations with potential functional relevance in local mesenchymal cells and infiltrating leukocytes in an organ-independent fashion. ? 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To estimate the prevalence of subclinical abnormalities reported in thoracic (CT) scans of cats and to investigate associations between respiratory signs and CT signs. METHODS Retrospective review of signalment, indications, respiratory signs and reported CT findings in a series of cats. Associations between patient variables, respiratory signs and CT signs were analysed using multi-variable regression methods. RESULTS Records of 352 consecutive cats were reviewed. Abnormalities affecting thoracic structures were reported in CT scans of 138/179 (77%) cats that did not have respiratory signs; the most prevalent CT findings were pulmonary collapse (41%), evidence of bronchial disease (24%) and space-occupying lesions (21%). Dyspnoea, cough and tachypnoea were associated with space-occupying lesions. Dyspnoea was also associated with pulmonary consolidation and atelectasis. Increasing body weight was associated with pulmonary atelectasis and increasing age was associated with evidence of bronchial disease. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Abnormalities were commonly detected in thoracic CT scans of cats that did not show respiratory signs. The most prevalent abnormality ? pulmonary atelectasis ? is probably a temporary effect of sedation or anaesthesia. A high prevalence of subclinical abnormalities and limited correlations between clinical signs and CT findings will complicate diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract The Patient Knowledge of, and Attitude and Behaviour towards Pressure Ulcer Prevention Instrument (KPUP) was developed and validated using a two-stage prospective psychometric instrument validation study design. In Stage 1, the instrument was designed, and it is psychometrically evaluated in Stage 2. To establish content validity, two expert panels independently reviewed each item for appropriateness and relevance. Psychometric evaluation included construct validity and stability testing of the instrument. The questionnaire was administered to a convenience sample of 200 people aged more than 65?years, living independently in the community; reliability and stability were assessed by test/retest procedures, with a 1-week interval. Mean knowledge scores at ?test? were 11.54/20 (95% CI = 11.10-11.99, SD: 3.07), and ?retest? was 12.24 (95% CI = 11.81-12.66, SD: 2.93). For knowledge, correlation between the test/retest score was positive (r=. 60), attitude section-inter-item correlations ranged from r =??.31 to r =?.57 (mean intraclass correlation coefficient of r =?.42), and internal consistency for the retest was the same as the test (α = .41 for the eight items). For health behaviours, individual inter-item correlations for test items ranged from r =??.21 to r =?.41 for the 13 standardised items. Psychometric testing of the KPUP in a sample of older persons in the community provided moderate internal consistency and general high test-retest stability.

AB  - Premise Plant sex is usually fixed, but in rare cases, sex expression is flexible and may be influenced by environmental factors. Theory links female sex expression to better health, but manipulative work involving the experimental change of health via injury is limited, particularly in sexually plastic species. A better understanding of mechanisms influencing shifts in sex is essential to our understanding of life history theory regarding trade-offs in sex allocation and differential mortality. Methods We investigated the relationship between physiological stress and sex expression in sexually plastic striped maple trees (Acer pensylvanicum) by inflicting damage of various intensities (crown pruning, defoliation, and hydraulic restriction). We then monitored the sex expression of injured and control individuals for 2 years to assess the extent to which injury may cue changes in sex expression. Results We found that severe damage such as full defoliation or severe pruning increased odds of changing sex to female and decreased odds of changing to male. In fact, no pruned male trees flowered male 2 years later, while all males in the control group flowered partially or fully male. After full defoliation, trees had 4.5 times higher odds of flowering female. Not all injury is equal; less-severe physical trauma did not affect the frequency of sex change to femaleness. Conclusions This work demonstrates that physical trauma in striped maple appears to exhibit a threshold effect in which only the most stressful of physiological cues instigate changes in sex expression, a phenomenon previously unknown, and that damage stress is strongly correlated with switching to femaleness. These findings have implications for population sex ratios and sustainability within an increasing stressful climate regime.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: The demands in the Standardbred trotters industry require young, still growing horses, to be trained well above light exercise level. During that period, the risk of occurrence of energy imbalance and maladaptation to training is high. In man, the lack of energy homeostasis is considered as the basic problem in the development of chronic fatigue. Objective: To find objective biomarkers of early maladaptation to training in young racehorses under field conditions. Materials and methods: Sixty-five 2-year-old Standardbreds were followed during their first 3 months of training in 5 different training centres. Monthly measurement of morphological variables (weight, height at withers, body condition score, body composition), basic haemato-biochemical variables and endocrine levels (testosterone, cortisol, thyroid hormones, leptin, IGF1, prolactin) were undertaken. Feeding levels and training programmes were also evaluated. At the end of the 3 month period, on the basis of an abnormal weight loss, 14 young horses were suspected of maladaptation to training (MT group). Morphological, haemato-biochemical, endocrine changes were compared between MT group (n = 14) and control group (C group, n = 40). Analysis of variance was calculated to study the effects of time and maladaptation to training. Results: Compared to C group, MT group showed a significant higher weight loss in relation to a higher loss of fat mass and body condition score (P<0.05). MT group presented higher GGT and white cell counts and lower red cell counts (P<0.05). Finally, MT group showed significant lower levels of T4 (P = 0.03) than C group. Conclusion: Some young horses presented signs of energy imbalance which were also associated with haematobiochemical and endocrine changes. Those markers might be useful for identification of maladaptation to training.

AB  - Abstract From August to November 1992, five typhoons struck the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam. Three hundred and twenty subjects exposed to all five typhoons participated in a population survey measuring their acute stress symptoms and subsequent diagnoses of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. A 23-item scale approximating the new DSM-IV diagnosis of acute stress disorder (ASD) was used to classify subjects into three groups based on their symptoms one week after the first typhoon: (1) probable ASD, (2) an early traumatic stress response (ETSR) of fear, intrusion, avoidance, and arousal, without dissociation, and (3) no acute diagnosis. A multi-dimensional measure of PTSD and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale were used to assess PTSD and depression 8 months after the first storm. The point prevalence of ASD at one week was 7.2%. An additional 15% of subjects had ETSR. Subjects with probable ASD at one week had significantly increased rates of PTSD and somewhat higher rates of depression at 8 months than those without ASD. In contrast, subjects with ETSR at one week did not have a poorer outcome than those with no acute diagnosis. These findings suggest that ASD is prognostically important, but also indicate that all acute stress symptoms do not have the same discriminative value. In this study, the acute dissociative symptoms of emotional numbing and derealization differentiated highly symptomatic subjects at risk for subsequent psychopathology (ASD) from others who were highly symptomatic at one week, but then had a more benign, posttraumatic course (ETSR).

AB  - Abstract??? The objectives of this study were to (i) characterize epidemiologic trends in anterior permanent tooth trauma in a sample of children and adolescents (ii) examine the relationship of crown fractures (CF) and concomitant root fractures (RF) to determine if CFs are protective against RFs and (iii) examine the radiographic evidence of RFs to determine the value of obtaining three vertical periapical radiographic projections. This was an 8-year cross-sectional study of patients aged 6?18 with anterior permanent tooth trauma. We examined cases involving maxillary central/lateral incisors for which three clearly diagnostic periapical radiographs were obtained during the initial emergency visit. Two trained and calibrated dentists served as expert examiners for the radiographic assessments. Kappa statistics were used to determine reliability. Tests for association of concomitant crown and root fractures were performed using Likelihood Ratio Chi-Square tests. The final sample included 185 teeth in 114 children. Our demographic and epidemiologic findings were comparable to those of previous studies. Experts reached this consensus: 22 RFs were detected, 9.6% (eight out of 83) teeth exhibited root fractures when no CFs was documented, and 13.7% (14 out of 102) teeth had both CFs and RFs as separate entities. Good examiner reliability was reached confirming the presence of RFs (Kappa?=?0.81). The association of concomitant RFs and CFs was odds ratio?=?1.97 (P?=?0.052). CFs were not protective against RFs; indeed, teeth with CFs were twice as likely to have an RF as those without CFs. As the number of radiographic projections increased, RFs were identified more often; however, our data suggest that there is no reason to suspect a complete RF in preteen children unless the root exhibits clinical signs such as luxation or severe mobility. This study provides solid evidence to support obtaining multiple radiographic projections at different vertical angulations to rule out RFs in children and adolescents when RFs are suspected.

AB  - Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the most prevalent psychological disorder experienced by Vietnam veterans. However, there are many other disorders and problems of adjustment, like social anxiety and social phobia, that have not been fully investigated in this population. This study examined the prevalence of social phobia and the comorbidity of social phobia and PTSD, and tested out a theory of the etiology of social anxiety in trauma victims. Forty one Vietnam combat veterans were interviewed and completed self-report measures assessing PTSD and social phobia. Adversity of homecoming was also assessed. Using a conservative multi-method assessment approach, 32% of the sample were found to be positive for both social phobia and PTSD. Veterans with PTSD were significantly more likely to cany an additional diagnosis of social phobia as compared to veterans without PTSD. Adversity of homecoming and shame about one's experience in Vietnam were significant predictors of current level of social anxiety over and above the effects of pre-military anxiety and severity of combat exposure. These observations suggest that social anxiety and social phobia may be significant problems among individuals with PTSD. Further, these findings offer preliminary support for the theory that posttrauma environment may impact upon the later development of social anxiety.

AB  - Background Disruptions in emotion regulation are a transdiagnostic risk factor for psychopathology. However, scant research has examined whether emotion regulation strategies are related to the onset of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among youths exposed to trauma. We investigated whether pretrauma emotion regulation strategies prospectively predicted PTSD symptom onset after the 2013 Boston Marathon terrorist attack among adolescents and whether these associations were moderated by the degree of exposure to media coverage of the attack. Methods A sample of 78 Boston-area adolescents (mean age = 16.72 years, 65% female) who previously participated in studies assessing emotion regulation and psychopathology were recruited following the terrorist attack. Within 4 weeks of the attack, we assessed self-reported PTSD symptoms and attack-related media exposure via an online survey. We examined the association of pretrauma emotion regulation strategies with PTSD symptom onset after adjustment for pretrauma internalizing symptoms and violence exposure. Results Greater pretrauma engagement in rumination predicted onset of PTSD symptoms following the attack. Adolescents who engaged in catastrophizing also had greater PTSD symptoms postattack, but only when exposed to high levels of media coverage of the attacks; the same pattern was observed for adolescents who engaged in low levels of cognitive reappraisal. Conclusions Engagement in specific emotion regulation strategies prior to a traumatic event predicts the onset of PTSD symptoms among youths exposed to trauma, extending transdiagnostic models of emotion regulation to encompass trauma-related psychopathology in children and adolescents.

Participants were athletes (N= 220; M age = 23.44 years, SD= 8.42) with a current sports-related musculoskeletal injury. Participants self-reported their cognitive and emotional injury representations, emotions coping procedures, physical and sports functioning, attendance at treatment centers, and 3-week follow-up attendance. Participants? negative and positive affect were influenced by emotional representations. Identity, causal attributions, and emotional representations influenced physical functioning; and identity, serious consequences, causal attributions, and emotional representations predicted sports functioning. Injury severity, identity, and personal control predicted attendance at treatment centers, but the effect of personal control was mediated by problem-focused coping. Problem-focused coping predicted 3-week follow-up attendance. Results support self-regulation theory for examining injury representations in athletes.

AB  - Abstract We document evidence for trophy-taking and dismemberment with a new bioarchaeological database featuring 13,453 individuals from prehistoric central California sites. Our study reveals 76 individuals with perimortem removal of body parts consistent with trophy-taking or dismemberment; nine of these individuals display multiple types of trophy-taking and dismemberment for a total of 87 cases. Cases span almost 5,000 years, from the Early Period (3000?500 BC) to the Late Period (AD 900?1700). Collectively, these individuals share traits that distinguish them from the rest of the population: a high frequency of young adult males, an increased frequency of associated trauma, and a tendency towards multiple burials and haphazard burial positions. Eight examples of human bone artifacts were also found that appear related to trophy-taking. These characteristics suggest that trophy-taking and dismemberment were an important part of the warfare practices of central Californian tribes. Temporally, the two practices soared in the Early/Middle Transition Period (500?200 BC), which may have reflected a more complex sociopolitical system that encouraged the use of trophies for status acquisition, as well as the migration of outside groups that resulted in intensified conflict. Overall, trophy-taking and dismemberment appear to have been the product of the social geography of prehistoric central California, where culturally differentiated tribes lived in close proximity to their enemies.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate risk factors associated with cranial cruciate ligament rupture in dogs. Methods: Retrospective case-control study: medical records of a first-opinion veterinary practice were searched for dogs diagnosed with cranial cruciate ligament rupture (1995 to 2007). For each case, six unaffected dogs were randomly selected from all dogs presenting that day for comparison. Multi-variable binary logistic regression was performed to assess the association of variables on likelihood of cruciate rupture. Results: Frequency of cranial cruciate ligament rupture was 1·19% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1·02 to 1.36%]. West Highland white terriers (n=17), Yorkshire terriers (n=14) and Rottweilers (n=11) were at significantly increased risk of cranial cruciate ligament rupture (P≤0·002). Rottweilers were at five times greater risk compared with other pure breeds (OR 5·12, 95% CI 2·281 to 11·494, P<0·001), obesity quadrupled the risk of cranial cruciate ligament rupture (OR 3·756, 95% CI 1·659 to 8·502, P=0·001) and females were twice as likely to suffer cranial cruciate ligament failure compared to males (OR 2·054, 95% CI 1·467 to 2·877, P<0·001). Dogs less than two years old were statistically less likely to sustain cranial cruciate ligament rupture than dogs older than eight years (OR 0·246, 95% CI 0·127 to 0·477, P<0·001). There was no significant difference in median weights (in kilograms) of neutered dogs, compared to their entire counterparts in either the case group (P=0·994) or in the control group (P=0·630). There was also no significant difference in body condition (-underweight/normal weight/overweight/obese) of neutered versus entire dogs among the cases (P=0·243), or the controls (P=0·211). Clinical Significance: Cranial cruciate ligament rupture is more likely in Rottweilers and in female dogs, older dogs and obese dogs. Following multi-variable analysis, it was established that neutering was not associated with increased risk of cranial cruciate ligament rupture.

AB  - Summary.? Introduction: Although the advent of multi-detector row computed tomography (CT) has enabled better visualization of subsegmental pulmonary (SSP) arteries, SSP embolism is of uncertain clinical significance. We aimed at answering the following questions: Is spiral CT an accurate method to detect SSP embolism? How are subsegmental perfusion defects managed in outcome studies including spiral CT? What are the main characteristics and outcomes of patients in whom CT detects isolated subsegmental defects? Methods: We performed a Medline search on July 1, 2004, using the keywords ?pulmonary embolism? and ?computed tomography?. We limited our search to English language prospective studies comparing CT to pulmonary angiography, and to prospective outcome studies including CT in a diagnostic strategy, with at least a 3-month follow-up. Results: Fourteen studies comparing CT to pulmonary angiography, and five prospective management studies using CT were retrieved. The sensitivity of single-detector CT for detecting subsegmental defects compared with pulmonary angiography was low (25%). The proportion of isolated SSP images was significantly higher in management studies using multi-detector CT (17 of 770 scans, 2.2%) compared with those using single-detector CT (22 of 2232, 1.0%; P?=?0.01). No straightforward attitude regarding anticoagulation therapy for isolated subsegmental defects emerged from the available literature. Finally, important clinical differences were found between patients having subsegmental and segmental or more proximal defects. Conclusions: These findings underline the uncertainty regarding the clinical significance of SSP embolism, and the management of patients with such findings.

AB  - SUMMARY Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is a pivotal cytokine at the centre of a cascade of cytokines and inflammatory mediators which modulate the host response to infection and trauma, and in particular the metabolic changes resulting in shock and subsequent multi-organ failure. The cytokine IL-8?predominantly an activator and chemotactic factor for circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophil leucocytes?is produced in response to TNF-αin vitro, and high circulating levels of IL-8 are found in septic primates. We have studied the release of IL-8 into the circulation of subjects with chronic hepatitis B undergoing a 10 week pilot trial of recombinant TNF-α (rTNF-α) therapy in doses of 15-100 ?g/m2, A marked dose-dependent increase in plasma IL-8 levels was seen commencing at 30-60 min after the start of rTNF-α infusion and peaking between 2 and 3 h (mean peak level 4300 ng/l). The temporal pattern of IL-8 production exactly echoed that of IL-6, another component of the cytokine cascade, but peak plasma levels of IL-8 were up to 17 times higher than those of IL-6. This study confirms in vitro data suggesting that IL-8 is a component of the acute circulating cytokine cascade with a potential role in the modulation of the acute immune and metabolic response to infection and trauma.

AB  - Abstract This article prospectively explores the effects of collective team work engagement and organizational constraints during military deployment on individual-level psychological outcomes afterwards. Participants were 971 Dutch peacekeepers within 93 teams who were deployed between the end of 2008 and beginning of 2010, for an average of 4?months, in the International Security Assistance Force. Surveys were administered 2?months into deployment and 6?months afterwards. Multi-level regression analyses demonstrated that team work engagement during deployment moderated the relation between organizational constraints and post-deployment fatigue symptoms. Team members reported less fatigue symptoms after deployment if they were part of highly engaged teams during deployment, particularly when concerns about organizational constraints during deployment were high. In contrast, low team work engagement was related to more fatigue symptoms, particularly when concerns about organizational constraints were high. Contrary to expectations, no effects for team work engagement or organizational constraints were found for post-traumatic growth. The present study highlights that investing in team work engagement is important for those working in highly demanding jobs. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: The diagnostic utility of routine faecal examinations can be greatly enhanced through an appreciation of risk factors most commonly associated with endoparasitism. Methods: From a sample of 6578 canine patients presenting to a veterinary teaching hospital between 1996 and 2006, this study used univariate and multi-variable techniques to examine putative signalment, medical history and demographic factors predisposing dogs to intestinal parasites. Results: Age and median household income were the strongest predictors of endoparasitism. The odds of a patient being diagnosed with endoparasites were 0·82 times smaller for every 1 year increase in age (OR=0·82, 95% CI: 0·80 to 0·84) and for every $10,000 increase in median household income, the odds were 0·86 times lower (OR=0·86, 95% CI: 0·83 to 0·89). The variables gender, neuter status, month of diagnosis, admitting clinical service and primary diagnosis were not significant predictors. Animals that were presented for underlying medical conditions were less likely to have parasites and the presence of diarrhoea was associated with 76% lower odds of endoparasitism compared to healthy animals (OR=0·76, 95% CI: 0·64 to 0·90). Clinical Significance: Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for parasites in younger patients that live in high population density and low income neighbourhoods.

AB  - Abstract Agriculture was and in most places still is, a disciplined life style that has bred strong character and high morals in virtually every culture. But such attributes are probably more the necessities of successful agriculture than its natural benefit. Modern agriculture, as practiced by Western cultures, is not the bucolic, healthful working environment fantasized in media classics such as Laura Ingalls Wilder's Farmer Boy. Whatever it was, agriculture is changing or facing change everywhere. While some cultures (and indeed some crops within all cultures) have yet to make the transition from human to animal to mechanized power, or from chemical to genetically engineered tools, where these transitions have occurred, production per farmer has increased. Unfortunately, so too have health and safety stresses upon farmers. Twenty years ago agriculture was the third most hazardous occupation. Although conditions within general industry improved during the intervening years, agriculture has been exempt of mandated safety and health services. Today agriculture is the most hazardous occupational group in the United States. In fact, modern farm life has recently been described as ?A Harvest of Harm.? This chapter hopes to address the needs and interests of industrial hygienists, as opposed to other reviews of agricultural hazards. It first describes the dilemma of agriculture as both an industry and as a way of life. Selected health hazards that are either characteristic of or unique to agriculture are then reviewed. A topical overview of hazardous processes, physical, biological and chemical agents, and diseases of concern in agriculture is given. The selected topics have been organized into acute and cumulative trauma, respiratory hazards, pesticides, veterinary chemicals, zoonoses, dermatoses, physical hazards, cancer, and mental stresses. The chapter concludes with a discussion of how the traditional industrial hygiene components of anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and control might be applied to agriculture, potential policies to stimulate industrial hygiene and safety services on the farm and ranch, and approaches employed in other countries to deliver such services. While the problems discussed are world wide, this chapter will focus on U.S. agriculture.
