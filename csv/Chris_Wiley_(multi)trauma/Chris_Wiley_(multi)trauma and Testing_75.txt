AB  - Objectives To evaluate the Leipzig Stifle Distractor (LSD) for arthroscopic evaluation of the medial meniscus. Study Design Prospective clinical multi-center study. Animals 64 stifles of 64 dogs (mean body weight 35 kg) with suspected cranial cruciate ligament rupture. Methods The LSD was used to distract the medial compartment and to evaluate the medial meniscus. The degree of exposure of the caudal pole of the medial meniscus (CMM) and ease of diagnosis was quantified after either distraction with the LSD or manipulation of the stifle with valgus stress and external rotation. Time for pin placement, level of difficulty and associated complications with LSD application were recorded. Medial collateral ligament integrity was tested by stress radiographs. Results The mean time for applying the LSD was 1.4 minutes (range 0.5?3.0). Application was considered easy in 90% and moderate in 10% of joints, with no complications recorded. LSD application increased exposure (P?<?.001) and facilitated probing of the CMM (P?<?.001), allowing for the diagnosis of 10 meniscal tears missed without the LSD. The use of LSD increased the likelihood of diagnosing a meniscal tear by 1.9 times. Based on the stress radiographs, medial collateral ligament integrity was maintained in all tested stifles. Conclusion Diagnosis of medial meniscal tears was improved using LSD. The LSD provided a safe and effective method for improved visualization and access to the caudal portion of the medial meniscus, which may allow for better arthroscopic assessment of meniscal pathology in dogs.

AB  - Abstract Many Americans own guns to protect themselves against other people, but there is evidence that both victimization and gun access increase suicide risk. We conducted qualitative interviews with informants of 17 suicide cases in New Orleans of the 60 who died between January 2015 and April 2016 to understand the relationship between past trauma, gun access and storage, and suicide. Nine cases had experienced a past trauma, including three who had recently had a family member killed by homicide. Eight died via firearm; of those, seven owned the guns they used to take their lives and stored them locked (but loaded) at home or in their cars. Preventing community violence and addressing its sequelae may be important for reducing suicides. A multi-pronged strategy consisting of policies, education, and marketing will likely be needed to address the risk of suicide conferred by gun access.

AB  - Abstract Clinical and empirical studies have documented significant alterations in self-related thought in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To our knowledge, however, few studies have examined self-referential cognition by analyzing survivors? written impact statements in individuals whose PTSD is due to interpersonal trauma. In the current study, we performed a linguistic analysis of impact statements (i.e., descriptions of how the trauma has affected the survivors? views of themselves, others, and the world) collected at the start of therapy from women with PTSD that was due to interpersonal trauma, with the goal of determining whether PTSD symptom clusters were associated with altered self-referential thought. We found that higher levels of PTSD-related hyperarousal symptoms were significantly associated with diminished self-related word use, after controlling for depression severity, f2 = .31. Similarly, diminished negative self-related word use was associated with higher levels of hyperarousal symptoms, f2 = .47. Our findings align with previous research that has provided evidence for a diminished sense of self in PTSD. These results may help inform targeted interventions aimed at improving social-affective functions in PTSD and other psychiatric conditions.

AB  - Objective Previous research has identified an association between traumatic experiences and psychotic symptoms. Few studies, however, have explored the underlying mechanisms and contingent nature of these associations in an integrated model. This study aimed to test a moderated mediation model of negative childhood experiences, associated cognitive processes, and psychotic experiences within a context of adolescent loneliness. Design Cross-sectional survey. Methods A total of 785 Northern Irish secondary school adolescents completed the survey. A moderated mediation model was specified and tested. Results Childhood experiences of threat and subordination were directly associated with psychotic experiences. Analyses indicated that peer victimization was a mediator of this effect and that loneliness moderated this mediated effect. Conclusion A new model is proposed to provide an alternative framework for assessing the association between trauma and psychotic experience in adolescence that recognizes loneliness as a significant contextual moderator that can potentially strengthen the trauma?psychosis relationship. Practitioner points Moderated mediation analyses poses an alternative framework to the understanding of trauma?psychosis associations Adolescent loneliness is a vulnerability factor within this association Data are based on a Northern Irish sample with relatively low levels of loneliness Cross-sectional data cannot explore the developmental course of these experiences in adolescence.

AB  - Abstract Unfocused extracorporeal shock waves (UESW) have been shown to have an anabolic effect on bone mass. Therefore we investigated the effects of UESW on bone in osteoporotic rats with and without anti-resorptive treatment. Twenty-week-old rats were ovariectomized (n?=?27). One group was treated with saline and another group with Alendronate (ALN) 2.4?µg/kg, 3?/week. UESW were applied 2 weeks after ovariectomy. Thousand UESW were applied to one hind leg, the contra-lateral hind leg was not treated and served as control. With the use of in vivo micro-CT scanning it was shown that in saline treated rats trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV) was higher at 2 weeks follow-up in UESW treated legs compared to control legs. However, at 4 and 10 weeks no difference was found. In ALN treated animals UESW led to a pronounced anabolic response resulting in an increase in BV/TV at all time-points. Furthermore, UESW resulted in increased cortical volume (CtV), higher trabecular connectivity and, more plate-like and thicker trabeculae. Biomechanical testing showed that UESW lead to a higher maximum force before failure and higher stiffness in all treatment groups. With histology abundant areas of intramembranous bone formation along the periosteal cortex and within the bone marrow were observed. In conclusion this study shows promising results for the use of UESW in the treatment of osteoporosis, especially when this treatment is combined with an anti-resorptive treatment. ? 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - BACKGROUND Implications from the pragmatic, randomize, optimal platelet and plasma ratios (PROPPR) trial are critical for remote damage control resuscitation (DCR). Utilizing DCR principals in remote settings can combat early mortality from hemorrhage. Identifying the appropriate transfusion strategy is mandatory prior to adopting prehospital hemostatic resuscitation strategies. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The PROPPR study was examined in relation to the following questions: 1) Why is it important to have blood products in the prehospital setting?; 2) Which products should be investigated for prehospital hemostatic resuscitation?; 3) What is the appropriate ratio of blood product transfusion?; and 4) What are the appropriate indications for hemostatic resuscitation? RESULTS PROPPR demonstrates that early and balanced blood product transfusion ratios reduced mortality in all patients at 3 hours and death from exsanguination at 24 hours (p?=?0.03). The median time to death from exsanguination was 2.3 hours, highlighting the need for point-of-injury DCR capabilities. A 1:1:1 transfusion ratio of plasma:platelets:packed red blood cells increased the percentage of patients achieving anatomic hemostasis (p?=?0.006). PROPPR used the assessment of blood consumption score to identify patients likely to require ongoing hemostatic resuscitation. The critical administration threshold predicted patient mortality and identified patients likely to require ongoing hemostatic resuscitation. CONCLUSION A balanced resuscitation strategy demonstrates an early survival benefit, decreased death from exsanguination at 24 hours and a greater likelihood of achieving hemostasis in critically injured patients receiving a 1:1:1 ratio of plasma:platelets:PRBCs. This finding highlights the need to import DCR principals to remote locations.

AB  - Increased-risk donor (IRD) organs make up a significant proportion of the deceased organ donor pool but may be declined by patients on the waiting list for various reasons. We conducted a survey of patients awaiting a liver transplant to determine the factors leading to the acceptance of an IRD organ as well as what strategies could increase the rate of acceptance. Adult liver transplant candidates who were outpatients completed a survey of 51 questions on a 5-point Likert scale with categories related to demographics, knowledge of IRDs, and likelihood of acceptance. A total of 150 transplant candidates completed the survey (age 19-80 years). Male patients constituted 67.3%. Many patients (58.7%) had postsecondary education. Only 23.3% of patients had a potential living donor, and 58/144 (40.3%) were not optimistic about receiving an organ in the next 3 months. The overall IRD organ acceptance rate was 41.1%, whereas 26.2% said they would decline an IRD organ. Women were more likely to accept an IRD organ (54.3% versus 34.7%; P = 0.02). Those who had a college education or higher tended to have lower IRD organ acceptability (28.3% versus 47.4%; P = 0.07). Acceptability also increased as the specified transmission risk of human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis C virus decreased (P < 0.001). Patients were also more likely to accept an IRD organ if they were educated on the benefits of IRD organs (eg, knowledge that an IRD organ was of better quality increased overall acceptance from 41.1% to 63.3%; P < 0.001). Our survey provides insight into liver transplant candidates who would benefit from greater education on IRD organs. Strategies targeting specific educational points are likely to increase acceptability.

AB  - Abstract ?Community mobilization? in the Community Trials Project refers to organizing community members to support and implement policies to reduce alcohol-involved trauma. This paper defines the conceptual model of mobilization used in the project. In evaluating the project, we were guided by the conceptual model and we used structured materials from interviews with local staff in all three experimental communities; we found that the overall goal of mobilization (implementation of policies) was achieved. Additional observations based on naturalistic case studies of the communities include: (1) the importance of an established research base, (2) the varying role and problematic nature of coalitions, (3) the strategic advantage of early project support r among the general population, (4) the role played by key leaders in mobilization, (5) the advantages of a multi-component design, and (6) the key role played by media advocacy.

AB  - summary? This study investigated the shear bond strengths of sectioned human mandibular incisor edge fragments reattached using luting cements, bonding agents or restored with composite resins. Seventy teeth were randomly distributed among six experimental groups and a control group. Leaving half of the anatomic crowns exposed, the teeth were embedded in self-cure acrylic resins with the exposed part then sectioned. The fragments in groups 1?4 were bonded to their respective teeth using Clearfil Liner Bond 2V, Scotch Bond Multi Purpose Plus, Panavia-F and 3M Opal Luting cement. The 5th and 6th groups were restored with composite resins (Silux 3M and Clearfil AP-X) using their bonding agents (Single Bond and Clearfil SE Bond). The results indicated that reattachment of fractured incisal fragments by using new generation bonding agents was effective against shear stresses, comparable with the intact teeth. Instead of restoration with composite resins therefore reattachment of a fractured fragment might be more preferable in cases of dental trauma.

AB  - Abstract Objective To identify the CAMCOG sub-items that best contribute for the identification of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD) in clinical practice. Methods Cross-sectional assessment of 272 older adults (98 MCI, 82 AD, and 92 controls) with a standardized neuropsychological battery and the CAMCOG schedule. Backward logistic regression analysis with diagnosis (MCI and controls) as dependent variable and the sub-items of the CAMCOG as independent variable was carried out to determine the CAMCOG sub-items that predicted the diagnosis of MCI. Results Lower scores on Language, Memory, Praxis, and Calculation CAMCOG sub-items were significantly associated with the diagnosis of MCI. A composite score obtained by the sum of these scores significantly discriminated MCI patients from comparison groups. This reduced version of the CAMCOG showed similar diagnostic accuracy than the original schedule for the identification of patients with MCI as compared to controls (AUC?=?0.80?±?0.03 for the reduced CAMCOG; AUC?=?0.79?±?0.03 for the original CAMCOG). Conclusion This reduced version of the CAMCOG had similar diagnostic properties as the original CAMCOG and was faster and easier to administer, rendering it more suitable for the screening of subtle cognitive deficits in general clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract Although skin grafting is one of the most advanced cell therapy technique, wide application of skin substitutes is hampered by the difficulty in securing sufficient amount of epidermal substitute. Additionally, in understanding the progression of skin aging and disease, and in screening the cosmetic and pharmaceutical products, there is lack of a satisfactory human skin-specific in vitro model. Recently, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have been proposed as an unlimited and reliable cell source to obtain almost all cell types present in the human body. This review focuses on the potential off-the-shelf use of hESC-derived keratinocytes for future clinical applications as well as a powerful in vitro skin model to study skin function and integrity, host-pathogen interactions and disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, we discuss the industrial applications of hESC-derived keratinized multi-layer epithelium which provides a human-like test platform for understanding disease pathogenesis, evaluation of new therapeutic modalities and assessment of the safety and efficacy of skin cosmetics and therapeutics. Overall, we conclude that the hESC-derived keratinocytes have great potential for clinical, research and industrial applications.

AB  - Abstract Cell-based tissue engineering is a promising approach for treating cartilage lesions, but available strategies still provide a distinct composition of the extracellular matrix and an inferior mechanical property compared to native cartilage. To achieve fully functional tissue replacement more rationally designed biomaterials may be needed, introducing bioactive molecules which modulate cell behavior and guide tissue regeneration. This study aimed at exploring the impact of cell-instructive, adhesion-binding (GCWGGRGDSP called RGD) and collagen-binding (CKLER/CWYRGRL) peptides, incorporated in a tunable, matrixmetalloprotease (MMP)-responsive multi-arm poly(ethylene glycol) (starPEG)/heparin hydrogel on cartilage regeneration parameters in vitro and in vivo. MMP-responsive-starPEG-conjugates with cysteine termini and heparin-maleimide, optionally pre-functionalized with RGD, CKLER, CWYRGRL or control peptides, were cross-linked by Michael type addition to embed and grow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) or chondrocytes. While starPEG/heparin-hydrogel strongly supported chondrogenesis of MSC according to COL2A1, BGN and ACAN induction, MMP-degradability enhanced cell viability and proliferation. RGD-modification of the gels promoted cell spreading with intense cell network formation without negative effects on chondrogenesis. However, CKLER and CWYRGRL were unable to enhance the collagen content of constructs. RGD-modification allowed more even collagen type II distribution by chondrocytes throughout the MMP-responsive constructs, especially in vivo. Collectively, peptide-instruction via heparin-enriched MMP-degradable starPEG allowed adjustment of self-renewal, cell morphology and cartilage matrix distribution in order to guide MSC and chondrocyte-based cartilage regeneration towards an improved outcome.

AB  - Summary Blood transfusion occurs in all parts of the world, but the availability, quality, and safety of the blood depends on the general status of medical care in that area. In contrast, the United States blood supply is provided by many different organizations with different organizational structures and philosophies. Certain areas of the United States are chronically unable to collect enough blood to meet their local transfusion needs. This occurs mostly in metropolitan areas that serve large trauma, tertiary, and transplantation centers. The American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) is a professional, nonprofit, scientific, and administrative association for individuals and institutions engaged in the many facets of blood transfusion and cellular therapies. America's Blood Centers (ABC) is an association of independent not-for-profit community blood centers established in 1962. The Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association (PPTA) is a trade association that advocates for the world's source plasma collectors and producers of plasma-based therapeutics.

AB  - Background: Repeated hypoxia and surgical trauma trigger a potent neuroendocrine response and their association is thought to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of multi-organ dysfunction. We investigated the cardiovascular and metabolic responses to repeated acute hypoxia in anaesthetised and surgically instrumented pigs. Methods: Under ketamine-midazolam anaesthesia, 15 pigs were surgically instrumented for measurements of cardiac output, vascular pressures and organ blood flows. Lactate production and O2 uptake were determined in the brain, liver, kidney and intestine. Ten animals were subjected to two 12-min periods of ventilatory hypoxia (FIO2=7%) followed by re-oxygenation and 5 animals underwent 120?min normoxic ventilation (Control group). Results: Both hypoxic challenges produced a comparable release of catecholamines that was associated with increased cardiac output and redistribution of blood flow away from the intestinal and renal areas towards the brain and the liver; O2 uptake was markedly reduced in the intestine (? 56 ± 10%, P < 0.05) and least affected in the brain and the kidney (? 19±12% and ? 23±21%, respectively). During the second hypoxic test, lethal cardiovascular depression occurred in 5 animals; these non-survivors demonstrated impaired hyperdynamic response and incomplete recovery of intestinal O2 uptake during the first hypoxia/reoxygenation test. In the Control group, normoxic ventilation was not associated with significant haemodynamic and metabolic changes. Conclusion: Intraoperative hypoxia causes marked heterogeneity in organ blood flow and metabolism. The inability to develop a hyperdynamic cardiovascular response during a first hypoxic event, as well as a persistent intestinal O2 debt following re-oxygenation, predict the occurrence of death during the second hypoxic insult.

AB  - Objective To identify incidence and risk factors for surgical glove perforation in small animal surgery. Study Design Observational cohort study. Sample Population Surgical gloves (n?=?2132) worn in 363 surgical procedures. Methods All gloves worn by operative personnel were assessed for perforation at end-procedure using a water leak test. Putative risk factors were recorded by a surgical team member. Associations between risk factors and perforation were assessed using multivariable multi-level random-effects logistic regression models to control for hierarchical data structure. Results At least 1 glove perforation occurred in 26.2% of procedures. Identified risk factors for glove perforation included increased surgical duration (surgery >1?hour OR?=?1.79, 95% CI?=?1.12?2.86), performing orthopedic procedures (OR?=?1.88; 95% CI?=?1.23?2.88), any procedure using powered instruments (OR?=?1.93; 95% CI?=?1.21?3.09) or surgical wire (OR?=?3.02; 95% CI?=?1.50?6.05), use of polyisoprene as a glove material (OR?=?1.59, 95% CI?=?1.05?2.39), and operative role as primary surgeon (OR?=?2.01; 95% CI?=?1.35?2.98). The ability of the wearer to detect perforations intraoperatively was poor, with a sensitivity of 30.8%. Conclusions There is a high incidence of unrecognized glove perforations in small animal surgery.

AB  - Aim There is strong evidence that adverse childhood experiences (ACE) are associated with poor short-, medium- and long-term health outcomes. In South Western Sydney, we trialled a modified ACE checklist in community paediatric clinics. Our aim was to design the best version of the ACE checklist for routine clinical use to serve as both a clinical and quality indicator. Methods We trialled two versions of the modified ACE checklist based on a pre-existing tool in child development (CD) and vulnerable child (VC) clinics over a 6-month period in 2012 (V1) and 7-month period in 2017 (V2). We analysed clinical and demographic data and correlated with ACE scores. We asked clinicians about the use of the ACE checklist and modified the checklist based on clinicians' recommendations. Results In phase 1, V1 was trialled in CD clinics only; 77 children were assessed, of whom 38 children (49%) had ACE score of ≥1, and 8 (10%) had a score of ≥4. In phase 2, of 279 children assessed, 178 (64%) had ACE ≥1, and 78 (28%) had ACE ≥4. In both phases, clinicians found the checklist simple to use and helpful in identifying especially vulnerable children. Conclusions The ACE checklist helps clinicians and managers identify the burden of exposure to trauma, violence and abuse of children attending paediatric clinics, both to facilitate intervention and aid service development. This version of the ACE checklist has the potential to be used across a variety of populations and settings as a clinical and quality indicator.

AB  - Non-technical summary? The superior colliculus (SC) is a subcortical brain structure critically involved in the production of eye and head movements to novel or salient visual cues. But to accomplish its function, an input from visual cortex also is required. Because visual cortex projects directly to the SC, this route is typically viewed as the predominant way by which cortex exerts higher-level control over SC-mediated behaviours. However, anatomical studies suggest that other multi-neuronal circuits through the basal ganglia, a collection of interconnected structures involved in decision making, might provide an alternative way for cortex to influence the SC. The present study provides physiological evidence for such an alternative route and affords additional insights into how the brain initiates and controls movements in response to visual cues. Such knowledge could be important for developing therapies to lessen the effects of visual deficits in patients experiencing loss of function following head trauma or stroke.

AB  - Summary Onychectomy, or surgical amputation of the third phalanx (P3), is an elective surgical procedure performed on the forelimbs of cats to eliminate destructive or harmful scratching behavior. After removal of P3, the surgical site is closed using suture or surgical tissue adhesive or left open to heal by second intention. Short-term complications include hemorrhage, pain, neuropraxia or ischemic injury secondary to tourniquet application, digital pad trauma, lameness, and non-weight bearing. Long-term complications include infection or osteomyelitis, nail regrowth, chronic pain syndrome, development of a palmigrade stance, lameness, and protrusion of the second phalanx (P2). Pain and lameness after onychectomy is a debilitating complication for the patient and can cause significant emotional stress for the pet owner. Most recent literature regarding feline onychectomy has focused on the use of CO2 laser and its potential for reducing pain and lameness compared with traditional blade dissection.

AB  - Abstract Objective The aim of this study was to assess the oral health knowledge among professionals who specialize in treating eating disorders, and identify to what extent their education, and training addresses oral health care delivery, and recommendations for individuals with eating disorders. Method Participants for this study were licensed behavioural and medical providers specializing in eating disorder treatment (n = 107), and recruited through professional eating disorder organizations. Participants completed an anonymous, online questionnaire (33 items) assessing level of oral health-related education, knowledge and treatment recommendations within the participant's respective eating disorder discipline. Results The majority of respondents (85%) were formally trained in eating disorders, and of those trained, 64.4% were not satisfied with the level of oral health education during formal education, and 19.5% report no oral health education. Respondents consider their knowledge of risk of oral disease for their clients/patients as average or above (84%), and ranked tooth erosion as the greatest reason for oral care (63%) while dry mouth led in the rankings for least significant reason for oral care (33%). Referral for oral care was found to be more common after reports of complication (55%). Discussion According to these findings, eating disorder professionals regard oral health care for their clients as significant, and may be unaware of associated oral risk factors, current oral care standards and long-term oral effects of disordered eating apart from enamel erosion.
