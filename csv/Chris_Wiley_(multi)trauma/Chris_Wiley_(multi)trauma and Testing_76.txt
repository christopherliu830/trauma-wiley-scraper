AB  - Background? The Stay Well and Healthy! Health Risk Appraisal (SWH-HRA) tool was developed and piloted in an in-home preventive healthcare program for persons ageing with intellectual and developmental disabilities (Aronow  Hahn & Aronow 2005). This paper presents the results of reliability and validity assessment of the SWH-HRA tool based on pilot data for 201 participants with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities (IDD) who were administered the SWH-HRA, a subsample of 36 who were administered the SWH-HRA twice within 100?days, and a subsample of 69 participants who received an advanced practice nurse (APN) (nurse practitioner) intervention. Materials and Methods? The reliability of the SWH-HRA tool was assessed using descriptive statistics, scale item analyses and correlation analyses. Descriptive statistics were run on all health risk measures of the SWH-HRA, and the results were examined for face validity. Cronbach?s alpha statistics were calculated for all multi-item scales. Factor analyses were used to evaluate the factor structure in three scales. Correlation statistics were used for test?retest reliability and for validity assessment comparing selected SWH-HRA scales with comparable measures used by the APN. Criterion validity was assessed by evaluating the relationship of the risk items or scales to use of emergency room and hospital services and to participation. Results? The findings of the psychometric analysis of the SWH-HRA tool, which was developed for assessing health and risks of persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities, support the tool?s overall reliability and validity. Conclusions? The findings add support for continued use and testing of the SWH-HRA in randomized clinical control trials comparing SWH-HRA use to usual care with persons with IDD. Further psychometric testing is indicated with persons with other types of disabilities.

AB  - Non-technical summary? The superior colliculus (SC) is a subcortical brain structure critically involved in the production of eye and head movements to novel or salient visual cues. But to accomplish its function, an input from visual cortex also is required. Because visual cortex projects directly to the SC, this route is typically viewed as the predominant way by which cortex exerts higher-level control over SC-mediated behaviours. However, anatomical studies suggest that other multi-neuronal circuits through the basal ganglia, a collection of interconnected structures involved in decision making, might provide an alternative way for cortex to influence the SC. The present study provides physiological evidence for such an alternative route and affords additional insights into how the brain initiates and controls movements in response to visual cues. Such knowledge could be important for developing therapies to lessen the effects of visual deficits in patients experiencing loss of function following head trauma or stroke.

AB  - Abstract Objective The aim of this study was to assess the oral health knowledge among professionals who specialize in treating eating disorders, and identify to what extent their education, and training addresses oral health care delivery, and recommendations for individuals with eating disorders. Method Participants for this study were licensed behavioural and medical providers specializing in eating disorder treatment (n = 107), and recruited through professional eating disorder organizations. Participants completed an anonymous, online questionnaire (33 items) assessing level of oral health-related education, knowledge and treatment recommendations within the participant's respective eating disorder discipline. Results The majority of respondents (85%) were formally trained in eating disorders, and of those trained, 64.4% were not satisfied with the level of oral health education during formal education, and 19.5% report no oral health education. Respondents consider their knowledge of risk of oral disease for their clients/patients as average or above (84%), and ranked tooth erosion as the greatest reason for oral care (63%) while dry mouth led in the rankings for least significant reason for oral care (33%). Referral for oral care was found to be more common after reports of complication (55%). Discussion According to these findings, eating disorder professionals regard oral health care for their clients as significant, and may be unaware of associated oral risk factors, current oral care standards and long-term oral effects of disordered eating apart from enamel erosion.

AB  - Summary In order to provide optimal care for the volleyball athlete, it is first necessary to understand the injury pattern. Ankle sprains account for approximately half of all acute time-loss injuries in volleyball. Risk factors for sport-related injuries may be generally classified as either ?intrinsic? or ?extrinsic?. The most important risk factor that has been identified for ankle sprains is a previous ankle sprain injury. Several intervention strategies have been proposed based on the typical injury mechanisms and risk factors for ankle sprains. One of the prevention strategies is to teach proper movement, take-off, and landing techniques. Patellar tendinopathy or ?jumper's knee? is the most common overuse injury in volleyball. Perhaps the most important element in preventing jumper's knee is to load the tendon appropriately. Knee injuries, and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in particular, occur more frequently among female than among male volleyball players.

AB  - Summary The vestibulocochlear organ is a multi-part structure that consists of the external, middle, and inner ear. Given that it can be readily observed on physical examination, the external ear is the focus of this chapter. The purpose of the external ear is to funnel sound toward the tympanic membrane, or eardrum. This facilitates the special sense of hearing. Although ear shape and structure vary depending upon breed standard, the function of the organ is essentially the same. In order to preserve the sense of hearing, the pinnae need to operate independently of one another, and the external ear needs to be open, as opposed to stenotic. The ear canal also needs to be free of excessive hair, cerumen, or other debris. Abnormal aural presentations are common in clinical practice and include both those problems that are limited to the pinnae and those that involve the external ear canal. Aural hematomas, infestation with Sarcoptes and Notoedres mange mites, and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) affect primarily the pinnae. By contrast, otitis externa involves inflammation of the external ear canal. Otitis externa is a frequent occurrence in both dogs and cats. Patients with long, droopy ears, excessive ear canal hair, or extensive swimming and/or bathing histories may be predisposed due to the potential for reduced aeration and increased moisture within the ears themselves. Patients with otitis may present with malodorous ears and irritation. Clinical signs frequently include head shaking, pawing, or scratching at the ears, and/or reluctance to allow the clinician to perform otoscopy. Otoscopy and cytology are important diagnostic tools that allow for reliable characterization of aural debris. Interpretation of aural cytology requires the clinician to recognize what constitutes normal resident flora of the ear canal. Bacterial and fungal overgrowth versus infection are important distinctions to make. Culture and drug susceptibility profiles may be indicated as follow-up diagnostic aids, particularly in cases of chronic or recurrent otitis externa, or when the patient's response to therapy is poor. The clinician must also make every attempt to identify the primary cause of aural disease. Ear infections are typically the result of other underlying conditions, including allergic skin disease, autoimmune disease, metabolic disturbances, such as hypothyroidism, and parasitic infestation. Without managing these primary causes, otitis externa is likely to recur.

AB  - Abstract Background/Aim Adhesive fragment reattachment (AFR) is one treatment option for crown-root fractured teeth. However, there are no studies investigating the long-term outcome of this approach. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of AFR and periodontal health in crown-root fractured teeth by assessing complications and periodontal status. Materials and Methods Data regarding 41 patients with 51 traumatized teeth (TT) were included. Periodontal health was assessed by recording the pocket probing depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), bleeding on probing (BoP), gingival index (GI), and plaque index (PI) in the TT and in one unaffected control tooth (CT). Complications were classified as ?restorative?, ?endodontic? and ?additional root fracture?. Based on these complications, the outcome was graded as ?success?, ?partial success?, ?survival? and ?failure?. Statistics was performed by t-test, chi-square-test and logistic regression models. Results After 8.5±4.6 years, 76.5% (39/51) of the TT had functionally survived. Functional survival of the reattached fragments was 66.7% (26/39) after 9.5±3.7 years. PPD (TT: 4.11±2.03; CT: 2.08±0.65), CAL (TT: 4.78±2.19; CT: 2.42±1.03) and BoP values (TT: 77.4%; CT: 22.6%) were higher in TT than in CT. GI scores >0 were found in 83.3% of the TT and in 27.8% of the CT. PI scores did not differ between TT and CT. Of the complications, 56.8% were ?restorative?, 22.7% ?endodontic? and 20.5% ?additional root fractures?. Eleven (27.5%) TT were without complications and rated as ?success?. Conclusions AFR in crown-root fractured teeth showed a high survival rate and occasionally compromised periodontal health. However, due to the high complication rate, it should be considered as a long-term temporary treatment to postpone other invasive therapy options. AFR can be a valuable way to avoid early loss of crown-root fractured teeth, especially in young patients. Moisture control and additional root fractures significantly influenced the outcome.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? To determine the level of agreement between trained ED nursing staff and senior ED medical staff in the application and interpretation of the National Emergency X-radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) low-risk criteria (NLC). Methods:? A NEXUS training and accreditation package was developed. It was successfully undertaken by 22 senior ED nursing staff and 26 senior ED medical staff. A study nurse and doctor independently applied the NLC to a convenience sample of patients who had been placed in a hard cervical collar prior to arrival in the ED. The findings for each of the NLC and the overall decision regarding collar removal were recorded on specific case report forms. The primary endpoint was the level of agreement for the overall decision to leave the collar in place. Levels of agreement for the individual NLC were also examined. Results:? In total, 183 patients were recruited. The level of ?safe agreement? where nursing and medical staff agreed that the collar should be left in place was 94.3% (95% CI: 89.5?97.2%). Agreement with regard to individual NLC varied from good to fair. The median times from patient arrival to completion of study nurse and doctor assessments were 14?min (interquartile ranges [IQR] 5?30) and 29?min (IQR 15?47), respectively. Conclusion:? The study demonstrated a high level of agreement between nursing and medical staff for stable low-risk trauma patients.

AB  - Summary The equine practitioner is in a position to make day-to-day decisions regarding antimicrobial drug (AMD) use for their patients as well as to educate their clients regarding judicious use. General guidelines regarding judicious use of AMDs in equine patients have been developed by the American Association of Equine Practitioners. Detailed guidelines for AMD use in specific equine diseases supported by clinical trials and results of surveillance studies focused on resistance among equine bacterial pathogens are lacking. Studies that could lead to detailed and justifiable use recommendations would allow the equine practitioner to make more informed decisions regarding when to use AMDs, which drugs should be used and how they should be used (e.g. dose, route and duration).

AB  - Abstract Background Obesity is common in the equine population and it has been associated with increased surgical morbidity and mortality in humans. The effect of increased body mass index (BMI) on the incidence of surgical site infections has not been investigated in horses. Objectives To determine whether horses with increased body fat, as estimated by BMI, are more likely to develop post-operative complications, particularly incisional complications, following emergency ventral midline celiotomy. Study design Retrospective, multi-institutional clinical study. Methods Medical records of horses >2 years old presenting with colic that underwent ventral midline celiotomy between January 2010 and September 2018 with follow-up of a minimum of 30 post-operative days were reviewed. Extracted data included signalment, operative details and outcome. BMI was calculated by dividing the patient's weight (kg) by the withers height squared (m2). Results In all, 287 horses fit inclusion criteria. Incisional complication prevalence was 23.7%. Horses with incisional complications had a higher BMI (median 203.6 kg/m2, IQR = 191.5-217.4) compared with those without (median 199.1 kg/m2, IQR = 184.7-210.2) (P = .03). Multi-variable analysis of the effects of age, sex, breed and presence of metabolic disease on the association between BMI and risk of incisional complications, identified a tendency towards increased risk with a higher BMI, but statistical significance decreased to P = .07. Breed had an association with BMI (P < .01), but not with incisional complication risk. Main limitations BMI as an estimate of body fat has limitations. Retrospective studies with reliance on owners reporting data and complete medical records is imperfect. When the data were subjected to multi-variable analysis, the trend towards an increased incidence of incisional complications in horses with higher BMI persisted but it was not statistically significant. Conclusion Higher BMI may increase the risk for the development of incisional complications in horses following emergency ventral midline celiotomy.

AB  - Abstract Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) plays key roles in cell adhesion and migration. We now report that the delayed rectifier Kv2.1 potassium channel, through its LD-like motif in N-terminus, may interact with FAK and enhance phosphorylation of FAK397 and FAK576/577. Overlapping distribution of Kv2.1 and FAK was observed on soma and proximal dendrites of cortical neurons. FAK expression promotes a polarized membrane distribution of the Kv2.1 channel. In Kv2.1-transfected CHO cells, formation of the Kv2.1-FAK complex was stimulated by fibronectin/integrin and inhibited by the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA). FAK phosphorylation was minimized by shRNA knockdown of the Kv2.1 channel, point mutations of the N-terminus, and TEA, respectively. Cell migration morphology was altered by Kv2.1 knockdown or TEA, hindering cell migration activity. In wound healing tests in vitro and a traumatic injury animal model, Kv2.1 expression and co-localization of Kv2.1 and FAK significantly enhanced directional cell migration and wound closure. It is suggested that the Kv2.1 channel may function as a promoting signal for FAK activation and cell motility. J. Cell. Physiol. 217: 544?557, 2008. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Downstream passage of European eel Anguilla anguilla (L.) in catchments with pump(s) for water level management is a major concern. Catchment-wide acoustic telemetry revealed silver eels quickly migrated downstream through unobstructed reaches (n = 12; mean ± SD = 17.9 ± 1.9 km/day). Fourteen of 17 acoustic-tagged eels detected at the pumping station (82.1%) retreated back upstream and ten (58.8%) passed through pumps after delays (9.5 ± 11.0 days). Multi-beam sonar imaging across the intake screen (55-mm gaps) revealed that peaks in migration occurred during the nights preceding the new moon but 76.7% retreated back upstream. All passive integrated transponder (PIT)-tagged eels recaptured (n = 56) downstream of a large (2.23-m diameter) mixed flow pump survived but 96.5% had minor injuries, reduced physical condition and/or abnormal behaviour. By contrast, 64.7% of PIT-tagged eels recaptured (n = 17) downstream of a small (0.8-m diameter) axial flow pump died. No acoustic-tagged eels that passed through the small axial flow pump (n = 10) performed onward migration at sea, unlike ?control? eels released downstream (n = 11). This evidence may help develop effective remediation measures, such as operational changes, to maximise escapement of catadromous eel species at pumping stations.

AB  - Abstract Boys and young men more frequently live out aspects of their psychic and social alienation online. This paper explores some of the risks and dangers that can arise from retreats into the two-dimensional world of cyberspace. It focuses more specifically on videogaming called MOBA, multi-player online battle arena games, in which players point and shoot at others. A case example emphasizes the clinical problems emerging from violent fantasies that seek a false form of containment in cyberspace. Themes of destructive fantasizing are further amplified through images of apocalypse, which are often prevalent in combat arena videogames. Textual sources from the Book of Revelation offer possible understanding for various elements of destructiveness as it appears in vulnerable male psyches. Therapeutic contact that combines a relational, containing approach and a broadly spiritual and soulful perspective can provide a path to healing such violent splits within the psyches of boys and young men.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to determine if balloon injury to the adjacent arterial wall during intracoronary stent deployment influences late in-stent neointimal formation. Stent design and deployment techniques are considered important factors in determining acute and long-term success with intracoronary stenting. Experimental and clinical studies support that the extent of neointimal formation and the probability for restenosis are influenced by the magnitude of arterial trauma induced with stenting. Nineteen 18-mm-long balloon-expandable stainless steel stents (MULTI-LINK Duet) were implanted at a 1:1 stent-to-artery ratio in the coronary arteries of swine with a conventional noncompliant balloon (n = 10) or a novel noncompliant balloon with short tapered shoulders to prevent edge dissection (n = 9). Quantitative coronary angiography and histology were used to evaluate balloon and artery interactions and the chronic vascular responses to the stents. Nineteen stents were implanted in the coronary arteries of seven swines at an inflation pressure of 14 atm using a standard noncompliant (n = 10) or a unique short transitional edge protection (n = 9) balloon. Histologic analysis at 28 days demonstrated balloon-associated barotrauma in 13 of 20 (65%) of adjacent nonstented arterial segments with the conventional balloon and only 3 of 18 (17%) of the adjacent nonstented arterial segments with the short transition edge protection balloon (P = 0.022). In-stent neointimal area and % stenosis correlated with the severity of peristent arterial injury (r = 0.43, P = 0.01). In-stent vessel injury scores were similar for stents with peristent injury (1.0 ± 0.3) versus stents without peristent injury (1.0 ± 0.03, P = 0.73). In-stent neointimal area and % stenosis were greater for stents with peristent injury (2.36 ± 0.74 mm2, 32% ± 9%) as compared to stents without peristent injury (1.39 ± 0.70 mm2, 20% ± 10%, P = 0.01). Arterial wall injury adjacent to a stent after high-pressure deployment contributes to late in-stent neointimal hyperplasia in this model. These experimental data suggest that further study is warranted to refine stent implantation techniques and that modifications of balloon shape or material may be useful to optimize stent deployment and reduce arterial trauma.

AB  - The construct of resilience was examined in a South Asian community impacted by natural and human-made disasters. Forty-three Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim Sri Lankans (27 women; age range 21?62?years) participated in 6 focus groups, conducted in either Sinhala or Tamil, to elicit participants? own ideas about components of resilience. Schema analysis of transcripts revealed that although some elements of resilience were common across ethnocultural groups, others differed by ethnic group. The differences appeared to be as much a function of type of trauma exposure as of culture. Components of resilience included many that are recognized in the western construct of resilience as well as 2 culturally unique components: strong will relating either to religious faith or to karma and psychosocial gratitude. These components could be examined in future measures of resilience with similar populations. Findings also revealed that some components of resilience can be taught; thus they can be the focus of interventions and public health policies.

AB  - Background/aim Legibility is important for functional, handwritten communication. Deficits in legibility can impair occupational performance following stroke or trauma. Few instruments are available to assess adult handwriting legibility during rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to compare inter-rater reliability of a new four-point legibility rating instrument with two existing instruments, and describe scale structure and item difficulty of each instrument. Methods Three trained raters scored 60 handwriting samples using: (i) a Four-Point Scale (FPS); (ii) the modified Evaluation Tool of Children's Handwriting (mETCH); and (iii) the new modified FPS. Rater concordance and exact agreement were investigated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC3,1), multi-rater kappa (?) and Krippendorff's alpha (α). Cronbach's alpha was calculated to examine internal consistency reliability, and Rasch modelling was used to examine scale structure and item difficulty. Results Rater concordance for the FPS was fair (ICC3,1 = 0.37); exact agreement was poor (? = 0.19; α = 0.19). Rater concordance for the two mETCH subtests was fair to moderate (ICC3,1 = 0.39?0.50), but with no exact agreement (? < 0.00). Rater concordance for three subtests of the modified FPS was slight to moderate (ICC3,1 = 0.16?0.51); exact agreement ranged from nil to fair (? = ?0.06?0.30; α = ?0.05?0.30). Rasch modelling confirmed internal consistency of instruments, but was low between-rater consistency (rater severity variability). Conclusions A reliable instrument for measuring change over time remains elusive. In the meantime, these instruments can be used by individual clinicians to diagnose and rate legibility.

AB  - A longstanding hypothesis links affective and behavioral inhibition with cancer incidence and progression though it does not clarify psychometric distinctions among related constructs. We hypothesized that repressive defensiveness, suppression, restraint, and distress would be separable factors in our sample of metastatic breast cancer patients. Our results support the discriminant validity of these constructs in our total sample, and the stability over 1 year in our control group. Using factor analysis, we found 4 separate factors at our prerandomization baseline corresponding closely to hypothesized constructs. Additionally, associations in a multi-trait, multi-occasion (baseline and 1 year) matrix met each of the 3 Campbell and Fiske (1959) criteria of convergent and discriminant validity. Future research testing the links between psychological, physiological, and survival outcomes with affective inhibition in cancer patients will be clearer when informed by these distinctions.

AB  - English as an international language (EIL) refers to the use of English by people of different nations in order to communicate with one another. Geopolitics refers to the political power in relation to geographic space. Within this broadly defined EIL context, this entry frames the political power of assessment and addresses this power from two dimensions. The first dimension is the geopolitics of international language testing, which deals with the testing of proficiency in English by speakers of other languages whose purpose of taking the test is to pursue academic study in English-speaking countries, such as the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). The second dimension focuses on the testing of proficiency in English by speakers of other languages whose purpose is for schooling in English-speaking countries, such as the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test (OSSLT) in Canada and the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) policy in the United States.

AB  - Abstract Aim To estimate the prevalence of, and identify factors associated with, depression and anxiety among community-based methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) clients in China. Design A cross-sectional survey. Setting Nine MMT clinics, three each from three Chinese provinces (Yunnan, Anhui and Jiangsu) between October 2008 and February 2009. Participants A total of 1301 MMT clients. Measurements A questionnaire, including the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and on-site urine drug testing. Findings The prevalence of depression (SDS score?≥?53) and anxiety (SAS score?≥?50) in our sample was 38.3% [95% confidence interval (CI)?=?35.7, 40.9] and 18.4% (95% CI?=?16.3, 20.5), respectively, with 14.2% (95% CI?=?12.3, 16.1) displaying symptoms of both. Sample prevalence rates for depression [mean?=?49.69, standard deviation (SD)?=?10.34] and anxiety (mean?=?40.98, SD?=?10.66) were higher than the national average for each (t(0.05/2, 1300)?=?19.2, P?<?0.001 and t(0.05/2, 1300)?=?8.0, P?<?0.001, respectively). Employing multi-level modelling techniques, gender (P?=?0.03) and employment status (P?<?0.001) were found to be associated significantly with depression in a single-level model; however, in a multi-level mixed model, only employment status (P?<?0.001) was associated with depression. Gender (P?=?0.03), education level (P?=?0.02), marital status (P?=?0.04), employment status (P?<?0.001), positive urine drug test results (P?=?0.02) and daily methadone dose (P?<?0.001) were found to be associated significantly with anxiety in a single-level model, while only employment status (P?<?0.01) and positive results for the urine drug test (P?=?0.04) were associated with anxiety in a multi-level mixed model. Conclusions A considerable proportion of methadone maintenance treatment clients in China have experienced depression and anxiety during treatment. There is a need to provide tailored mental health interventions for this high-risk population.

AB  - Inguinal hernia was associated with trauma in five dogs and was considered nontraumatic in 30 dogs. There were 11 males, 13 intact females, and six spayed females with nontraumatic inguinal hernia. Six dogs had bilateral hernias. Five dogs were younger than 4 months at the time of diagnosis. In 11 older dogs with nontraumatic inguinal hernia, the hernias were identified less than 7 days before surgical repair; in 14 older dogs, the hernias had been recognized for 1 to 60 months. Clinical signs in dogs without small intestinal incarceration were usually limited to a visible or palpable mass without pain or systemic illness. Hemiorrhaphy approaches included inguinal, midline with contralateral ring evaluation, and celiotomy with or without inguinal exposure. Fat and omentum were the most common hernial contents. Small intestine was within the hernias of 12 dogs. Six dogs had nonviable small intestine. Postoperative complications included two incisional infections, one incisional dehiscence, two cases of peritonitis and sepsis associated with bowel leakage after intestinal resection and anastomosis, and one hernia recurrence. The overall prevalence of postoperative complications was 17%, and the mortality rate was 3%. Vomiting for 2 to 6 days was predictive of nonviable small intestine. Dogs younger than 2 years were at 11 times greater risk for nonviable small intestine than dogs older than 2 years. Four of five dogs with nontraumatic inguinal hernia and nonviable small intestine were intact males, whereas none of 13 intact females were affected. Only one of 14 dogs with longstanding hernias had nonviable small intestine.
