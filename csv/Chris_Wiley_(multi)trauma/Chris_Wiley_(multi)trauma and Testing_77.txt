AB  - Abstract Objectives:? The residency review committee for emergency medicine (EM) requires residents to have greater than 70% attendance of educational conferences during residency training, but it is unknown whether attendance improves clinical competence or scores on the American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) in-training examination (ITE). This study examined the relationship between conference attendance and ITE scores. The hypothesis was that greater attendance would correlate to a higher examination score. Methods:? This was a multi-center retrospective cohort study using conference attendance data and examination results from residents in four large county EM residency training programs. Longitudinal multi-level models, adjusting for training site, U.S. Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 score, and sex were used to explore the relationship between conference attendance and in-training examination scores according to year of training. Each year of training was studied, as well as the overall effect of mean attendance as it related to examination score. Results:? Four training sites reported data on 405 residents during 2002 to 2008; 386 residents had sufficient data to analyze. In the multi-level longitudinal models, attendance at conference was not a significant predictor of in-training percentile score (coefficient = 0.005, 95% confidence interval [CI] = ?0.053 to 0.063, p?=?0.87). Score on the USMLE Step 1 examination was a strong predictor of ITE score (coefficient = 0.186, 95% CI = 0.155 to 0.217; p?<?0.001), as was female sex (coefficient = 2.117, 95% CI = 0.987 to 3.25; p?<?0.001). Conclusions:? Greater conference attendance does not correlate with performance on an individual?s ITE scores. Conference attendance may represent an important part of EM residency training but perhaps not of ITE performance.

AB  - Inguinal hernia was associated with trauma in five dogs and was considered nontraumatic in 30 dogs. There were 11 males, 13 intact females, and six spayed females with nontraumatic inguinal hernia. Six dogs had bilateral hernias. Five dogs were younger than 4 months at the time of diagnosis. In 11 older dogs with nontraumatic inguinal hernia, the hernias were identified less than 7 days before surgical repair; in 14 older dogs, the hernias had been recognized for 1 to 60 months. Clinical signs in dogs without small intestinal incarceration were usually limited to a visible or palpable mass without pain or systemic illness. Hemiorrhaphy approaches included inguinal, midline with contralateral ring evaluation, and celiotomy with or without inguinal exposure. Fat and omentum were the most common hernial contents. Small intestine was within the hernias of 12 dogs. Six dogs had nonviable small intestine. Postoperative complications included two incisional infections, one incisional dehiscence, two cases of peritonitis and sepsis associated with bowel leakage after intestinal resection and anastomosis, and one hernia recurrence. The overall prevalence of postoperative complications was 17%, and the mortality rate was 3%. Vomiting for 2 to 6 days was predictive of nonviable small intestine. Dogs younger than 2 years were at 11 times greater risk for nonviable small intestine than dogs older than 2 years. Four of five dogs with nontraumatic inguinal hernia and nonviable small intestine were intact males, whereas none of 13 intact females were affected. Only one of 14 dogs with longstanding hernias had nonviable small intestine.

AB  - Objectives.? Four domains of predictors of support provision were tested in couples facing an illness-related stress context. Predictor domains of partners' support provision to patients adapting to incontinence following prostatectomy included stress factors, recipient factors, provider factors, and relationship factors. Methods.? Data from 109 patients and their female partners were analysed. Couples provided data on five measurement occasions from 2 weeks to 1 year postsurgery. Predictors included patient's incontinence (stress factor), patient's support mobilization, affect and general self-efficacy (recipient factors), partner's affect and general self-efficacy (provider factors), partners' average waking time spent together, both partners' relationship satisfaction and partner's received support from patient (as an indicator of reciprocal support; relationship factors). Results.? Provider factors were not reliably associated with support provision, neither was patient negative affect. Stress and relationship factors accounted for outcome variance in the expected directions. Among recipient factors, mobilization of support and patient self-efficacy were positively related with the outcome, whereas patient positive affect was negatively associated with support provision by partners. Conclusions.? Findings on predictor domains are in line with other couple studies that used non-illness-related stress contexts. Resemblance of findings points to generalizability of predictions across stress contexts varying in content, controllability, and duration.

AB  - Abstract There is currently a lack of clear evidence on the impact of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on fracture healing post-operatively. Australian orthopaedic surgeons were surveyed about their perceptions of the relationship between NSAIDs and fracture healing to determine whether equipoise exists within the profession. Results demonstrated divergence of opinion amongst Australian orthopaedic surgeons, lending support to the commencement of randomised controlled trials testing the influence of NSAIDs on fracture healing within Australia.

AB  - ABSTRACT The osteocyte product sclerostin is emerging as an important paracrine regulator of bone mass. It has recently been shown that osteocyte production of receptor activator of NF-?B ligand (RANKL) is important in osteoclastic bone resorption, and we reported that exogenous treatment of osteocytes with sclerostin can increase RANKL-mediated osteoclast activity. There is good evidence that osteocytes can themselves liberate mineral from bone in a process known as osteocytic osteolysis. In the current study, we investigated sclerostin-stimulated mineral dissolution by human primary osteocyte-like cells (hOCy) and mouse MLO-Y4 cells. We found that sclerostin upregulated osteocyte expression of carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2/Car2), cathepsin K (CTSK/Ctsk), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (ACP5/Acp5). Because acidification of the extracellular matrix is a critical step in the release of mineral from bone, we further examined the regulation by sclerostin of CA2. Sclerostin stimulated CA2 mRNA and protein expression in hOCy and in MLO-Y4 cells. Sclerostin induced a decrease in intracellular pH (pHi) in both cell types as well as a decrease in extracellular pH (pHo) and the release of calcium ions from mineralized substrate. These effects were reversed in the co-presence of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetozolamide. Car2-siRNA knockdown in MLO-Y4 cells significantly inhibited the ability of sclerostin to both reduce the pHo and release calcium from a mineralized substrate. Knockdown in MLO-Y4 cells of each of the putative sclerostin receptors, Lrp4, Lrp5 and Lrp6, using siRNA, inhibited the sclerostin induction of Car2, Catk and Acp5 mRNA, as well as pHo and calcium release. Consistent with this activity of sclerostin resulting in osteocytic osteolysis, human trabecular bone samples treated ex vivo with recombinant human sclerostin for 7 days exhibited an increased osteocyte lacunar area, an effect that was reversed by the co-addition of acetozolamide. These findings suggest a new role for sclerostin in the regulation of perilacunar mineral by osteocytes. ? 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - Abstract Critically ill patients, not infrequently present alterations of physiological parameters that determine the success/failure of therapeutic interventions as well as the final outcome. Sepsis and polytrauma are two of the most common and complex syndromes occurring in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and affect drug absorption, disposition, metabolism and elimination. Pharmacological management of ICU patients requires consideration of the unique pharmacokinetics associated with these clinical conditions and the likely occurrence of drug interaction. Rational adjustment in drug choice and dosing contributes to the appropriateness of treatment of those patients.

AB  - The Campbell systematic review aims to examine the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions in reducing symptoms of distress and trauma for victims of sexual assault and rape. Six studies including 405 participants met eligibility criteria, with data from 358 participants available for analysis. Results of this systematic review provide tentative evidence that cognitive and behavioural interventions, in particular Cognitive Processing Therapy, Prolonged Exposure therapy, Stress Inoculation Therapy, and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing can be associated with decreased symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety in victims of rape and sexual assault. There is a need for further well-designed controlled studies which differentiate victims of sexual assault and rape from other traumatic events. Executive summary/Abstract BACKGROUND Beginning with the articulation of Rape Trauma Syndrome (Burgess 1974), the traumatic aftermath of sexual assault on victims has become a focus of social and legal policy, scholarly inquiry, and mental health interventions. The wide variety of psychosocial treatment modalities for victims of sexual violence reported in the literature and used in practice are predominantly based on psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioural or feminist-informed theoretical frameworks. Some modalities have been specifically designed for victims of sexual violence while others have been adapted from use with other traumatized populations. Although there is evidence of effective treatments for addressing traumatic stress in victims of many types of trauma, modalities specific to victims of sexual assault have not been systematically tested. Evidence suggests that trauma associated with rape or sexual assault differs from trauma stemming from other experiences, in part due to the strong element of self-blame, the individualized nature of this type of trauma, social support and social acceptance factors, and the higher incidence of concurrent depression. Therefore, it is critical to examine the effectiveness of interventions specific to victims of sexual violence and rape. OBJECTIVES To examine the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions in reducing symptoms of distress and trauma for victims of sexual assault and rape. SEARCH STRATEGY Both published and unpublished work was considered eligible for the review. Electronic searches were conducted in June 2009 and in April 2011 within the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR); MEDLINE; EMBASE; EMBASE Classic; All EBM Reviews; PsycINFO; ASSIA (Applied Social Sciences Indexes and Abstracts); ERIC; Social Sciences Abstracts; Social Services Abstracts; Social Sciences Citation Index; Criminal Justice Abstracts; Violence and Abuse Abstracts; Social Work Abstracts; Dissertation Abstracts International (DAI); CINAHL; Gender Studies Database; and Contemporary Women's Issues. Reference lists of all relevant articles were also screened and requests for additional studies made to authors and key informants. To supplement the electronic searches, seven journals relevant to the sexual assault, rape or sexual violence were hand-searched up to April 2009: Journal of Traumatic Stress; Journal of Interpersonal Violence; Victims and Offenders; Trauma Abuse and Violence; Violence against Women; American Journal of Psychiatry; and British Journal of Psychiatry. SELECTION CRITERIA Studies were eligible for the review if (a) the allocation of study participants to experimental or control groups was by random allocation or quasi-experimental parallel cohort design; (b) participants were adults who had experienced sexual assault or rape as adults; and (c) the intervention specifically focused on victims of sexual assault or rape. Studies with participants that identified primarily as victims of childhood sexual abuse were not included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors screened abstracts and read the full-text of all eligible articles. Standardised mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for all relevant outcomes. RESULTS Six studies including 405 participants met eligibility criteria, with data from 358 participants available for analysis. Two of the studies evaluated Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT, totalling 80 participants); three evaluated Prolonged Exposure (PE, n= 94); two evaluated Stress Inoculation Therapy (SIT, n=26); one evaluated Supportive Psychotherapy (SP, n=12) and two examined Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing therapy (EMDR, n=34). Meta-analysis comparing all treatments against no treatment for the randomized controlled trials revealed significant results for PTSD symptoms, both independently observed [SMD -1.81 (95% CI -2.90 to -0.72, four studies)] and self-reported [SMD -1.90 (95% CI -2.73 to -1.07, three studies)] at post-treatment. Meta-analyses of relevant outcomes from the six included studies revealed that all the treatments had a statistically significant effect on PTSD and depression symptoms in comparison to the control groups at post-test. The four studies that included anxiety as an outcome also showed significant improvements. Other outcomes that demonstrated improvements included guilt (following CPT and to a lesser extent, PE) and dissociation (following EMDR treatment). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Results of this systematic review provide tentative evidence that cognitive and behavioural interventions, in particular Cognitive Processing Therapy, Prolonged Exposure therapy, Stress Inoculation Therapy, and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing can be associated with decreased symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety in victims of rape and sexual assault. There is a need for further well-designed controlled studies which differentiate victims of sexual assault and rape from other traumatic events.

AB  - Background The aim of this study is to identify predisposing factors, the clinical course and visual outcomes in patients with keratitis after intracorneal ring implantation. Methods In a retrospective study, 11 patients with documented keratitis after intracorneal ring implantation and 71 matched controls with uncomplicated surgery were enrolled. Patients were examined for slitlamp findings and corrected distance visual acuity at time of the initial presentation, one month later and six months later. Smears and cultures were provided in all cases. Relevant data in controls were extracted from their medical records, and statistical analysis was done. Results Keratitis onset time ranged from three to 56 days. The incidence was 2.7 per cent over two years. All pathogens were Gram-positive cocci, and the most frequent was Staphylococcus spp. No relationship was found between keratitis occurrence and the ring type or the femtosecond procedure, but the rate of keratitis was higher in patients with the horizontal position of intracorneal ring segments (p = 0.001; Fisher's exact test). All cases were treated with implant explantation and tunnel irrigation with antibiotics. In three cases, amniotic membrane transplantation was performed, and two cases finally underwent penetrating keratoplasty. The final six month corrected distance visual acuity was 0.68 ± 0.35. Poor corrected distance visual acuity improvement was associated with the ulcer size at the first day of the diagnosis (p = 0.011; Spearman's rho). Conclusion The only predisposing factor was the horizontal position of the ring. A careful evaluation in the early post-operative period for any sign of the infiltration would be helpful. Early diagnosis with proper management including fortified antibiotic therapy specifically against Gram-positive cocci and removal of the intracorneal ring seems to result in acceptable visual outcomes in later follow-up. However, a corneal transplant may be the only choice in advanced infectious complications.

AB  - Abstract Clinical cellular therapeutics (CCTs) have shown preliminary efficacy in reducing inflammation after trauma, preserving cardiac function after myocardial infarction, and improving functional recovery after stroke. However, most clinically available cell lines express tissue factor (TF) which stimulates coagulation. We sought to define the degree of procoagulant activity of CCTs as related to TF expression. CCT samples from bone marrow, adipose, amniotic fluid, umbilical cord, multi-potent adult progenitor cell donors, and bone marrow mononuclear cells were tested. TF expression and phenotype were quantified using flow cytometry. Procoagulant activity of the CCTs was measured in vitro with thromboelastography and calibrated thrombogram. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) separated samples into high- and low-TF expressing populations to isolate the contribution of TF to coagulation. A TF neutralizing antibody was incubated with samples to demonstrate loss of procoagulant function. All CCTs tested expressed procoagulant activity that correlated with expression of tissue factor. Time to clot and thrombin formation decreased with increasing TF expression. High-TF expressing cells decreased clotting time more than low-TF expressing cells when isolated from a single donor using FACS. A TF neutralizing antibody restored clotting time to control values in some, but not all, CCT samples. CCTs demonstrate wide variability in procoagulant activity related to TF expression. Time to clot and thrombin formation decreases as TF load increases and this procoagulant effect is neutralized by a TF blocking antibody. Clinical trials using CCTs are in progress and TF expression may emerge as a safety release criterion. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2018;7:731?739

AB  - Summary Psychology pervades all aspects of human life. To better understand the psychology of violence, especially as it is relevant beyond the surface, psychological principles can prove very useful. Psychology can shed light on human violence in terms of different levels of motivation, defenses, and paradoxical thinking. Violence is complex and can be difficult to understand at first glance. It helps to know, therefore, how hidden motives form and how understandable attempts to avoid emotional pain can result in maladaptive behavior and cause pain in return. For this, we cannot reduce psychology to the currently popular neuroscience, cognitivism, or behaviorism. Rather, we will have to understand it in its own right. The branch that deals with deeper motives and unconscious processes, as are helpful to understanding violence, is psychodynamic theory. Psychodynamic theory can be particularly helpful to identifying various defense mechanisms, paradoxical aspects of the mind, and the importance of early experiences in understanding how individuals or groups turn violent. While its scope of intrapsychic events can be a drawback, delving into intimate emotional life is essential to understanding the depths of the mind. More recent concepts in positive psychology can also complement traditional approaches and help us to avert determinism in trauma and violence.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To compare the perioperative systemic immunity of laparoscopy-assisted and open radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Methods: Patients with gastric adenocarcinoma proven by endoscopy and biopsy were eligible, while patients with preoperative staging of T4, N2?3, or M1 were excluded. Eligible patients willing to undertake laparoscopic surgery in the consecutive cohort were assigned to the laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy (LAG) group, while concurrent patients were assigned to the conventional open gastrectomy (OG) group. All operations were performed with the intention of radical resection. Various immunological parameters were tested in peripheral venous blood collected at preoperative 1st day and postoperative 2nd day (POD2) and 7th day (POD7). SPSS 13.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Results: Thirty patients were included, 15 each in the LAG and OG groups. The general characteristics and short-term outcomes (harvested lymph nodes number, hospital stay, complications, and mortality rate) of the two groups were comparable, but the operation time was significantly longer in LAG (P = 0.001). Moreover, intergroup comparisons indicated no significant differences between the groups in levels of neutrophils, T-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, C4, interleukin-6, or interleukin-10 at any time point (P?>?0.05). However, there was a gradual decrease in natural killer cell count in the LAG group up to POD7 (P = 0.008). Conclusion: The changes in systemic immunity markers were comparable between laparoscopy-assisted and open gastrectomy for gastric cancer. However, there was a trend of suppression of natural killer cells in the laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy group.

AB  - Abstract We measured ERPs of professional boxers in a Go/No-Go task, comparing them to fencers and non-athletes. Results showed that fencing improved attention and motor response control, but boxing did not. More strikingly, in boxers, as in brain trauma patients, the P3 component was delayed and reduced. The P3 delay of boxers was correlated with the amount of performed sport exercise. Furthermore, in terms of behavior, boxers showed increased intra-individual variability and switch cost. Results were consistent with the hypothesis of specific impairment at the level of response inhibition processing. We suggest that this impairment is derived from the cumulative effect of blows to the head. The changes found in boxers suggest that ERPs and reaction times may be a tool for early detection of specific brain dysfunction.

AB  - Abstract Objectively Tendinopathy is a common problem in sports medicine which can lead to severe morbidity. Aspirin, as the classical representative of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions, has been commonly used in treating tendinopathy. While its treatment effects on injury tendon healing are lacking, illuminating the underlying mechanism may provide scientific basis for clinical treatment. Materials and methods Firstly, we used immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR to detect changes in CD14, CD206, iNOS, IL-6, IL-10, MMP-3, TIMP-3, Col-1a1, biglycan, Comp, Fibronectin, TGF-?1?ACAN?EGR-1 and FMOD. Next, Western blot was used to measure the protein levels (IL-6, IL-10, TGF-?1, COMP, TIMP-3, STAT-3/P-STAT-3 and JNK/P-JNK) in TSCs. Then, migration and proliferation of TSCs were measured through wound healing test and BrdU staining. Finally, the mechanical properties of injury tendon were detected. Results After aspirin treatment, the inflammation and scar formation in injury tendon were significantly inhibited by aspirin. Still, tendon's ECM was positively balanced. Increasing migration and proliferation ability of TSCs induced by IL-1? were significantly reversed. JNK/STAT-3 signalling pathway participated in the process above. In addition, biomechanical properties of injury tendon were significantly improved. Conclusions Taken together, the findings suggested that aspirin inhibited inflammation and scar formation via regulation of JNK/STAT-3 signalling and decreased rerupture risk of injury tendon. Aspirin could be an ideal therapeutic strategy in tendon injury healing.

AB  - T2 relaxation time mapping provides information about the biochemical status of intervertebral discs. The present study aimed to determine whether texture features extracted from T2 maps or geometric parameters are sensitive to the presence of abnormalities at the posterior aspect of lumbar intervertebral discs, i.e. bulging and herniation. Thirty-one patients (21 women and 10 men; age range 18?51?years) with low back pain were enrolled. MRI of the lumbar spine at 3.0 Tesla included morphological T1- and T2-weighted fast spin-echo sequences, and multi-echo spin-echo sequences that were used to construct T2 maps. On morphological MRI, discs were visually graded into ?normal?, ?bulging? or ?herniation?. On T2 maps, texture analysis (based on the co-occurrence matrix and wavelet transform) and geometry analysis of the discs were performed. The three T2 texture features and geometric parameters best-suited for distinguishing between normal discs and discs with bulging or herniation were determined using Fisher coefficients. Statistical analysis comprised ANCOVA and post hoc t-tests. Eighty-two discs were classified as ?normal?, 49 as ?bulging? and 20 showed ?herniation.? The T2 texture features Entropy and Difference Variance, and all three pre-selected geometric parameters differed significantly between normal and bulging, normal and herniated, and bulging and herniated discs (p?<?0.05). These findings suggest that T2 texture features and geometric parameters are sensitive to the presence of abnormalities at the posterior aspect of lumbar intervertebral discs, and may thus be useful as quantitative biomarkers that predict disease.

AB  - The impact of ischemia/reperfusion injury in the setting of transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been thoroughly investigated. The present study examined data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients for all recipients of deceased donor liver transplants performed between January 1, 1995 and October 31, 2011. In a multivariate Cox analysis, significant predictors of patient survival included the following: HCC diagnosis (P < 0.01), donation after cardiac death (DCD) allograft (P < 0.001), hepatitis C virus-positive status (P < 0.01), recipient age (P < 0.01), donor age (P < 0.001), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score (P < 0.001), recipient race, and an alpha-fetoprotein level > 400 ng/mL at the time of transplantation. In order to test whether the decreased survival seen for HCC recipients of DCD grafts was more than would be expected because of the inferior nature of DCD grafts and the diagnosis of HCC, a DCD allograft/HCC diagnosis interaction term was created to look for potentiation of effect. In a multivariate analysis adjusted for all other covariates, this interaction term was statistically significant (P = 0.049) and confirmed that there was potentiation of inferior survival with the use of DCD allografts in recipients with HCC. In conclusion, patient survival and graft survival were inferior for HCC recipients of DCD allografts versus recipients of donation after brain death allografts. This potentiation of effect of inferior survival remained even after adjustments for the inherent inferiority observed in DCD allografts as well as other known risk factors. It is hypothesized that this difference could reflect an increased rate of recurrence of HCC. Liver Transpl 19:1214?1223, 2013. ? 2013 AASLD.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The Myanmar Ministry of Health has formed a partnership with Australasian professional colleges and international medical specialists to deliver a comprehensive programme for emergency care training and development. We describe this programme, emphasising the training of the first emergency specialists for Myanmar. Methods Eighteen junior specialists (EM18) joined a new postgraduate diploma in emergency medicine (Dip EM) through the University of Medicine (1) (UM1), Yangon. Diploma content included an introductory course, clinical rotations, 2 months in the emergency receiving centre (ERC) of the Yangon General Hospital (YGH) supervised by a volunteer Australasian emergency physician (FACEM), several short courses and an educational visit to Hong Kong. Curriculum and assessments comprising written and oral exams were devised and delivered by volunteer FACEMs and Hong Kong specialists. Results All EM18 completed the 18 month programme and passed the final assessments to graduate in February 2014. Course strengths included the supervised clinical rotation to the ERC and short course teaching on emergency medical, surgical, trauma, paediatric and disaster topics. The educational visit to Hong Kong enabled the EM18 to visualise more advanced EM systems that could be adapted to the Myanmar context. The participating international clinicians provided expert strategic advice on ED design, staffing, equipment, nursing and pre-hospital systems to leaders within universities, hospitals and the Ministry of Health. Conclusion The first Myanmar postgraduate diploma in EM provides an example of collaborative and responsive clinical health capacity building in a context of very limited resources.

AB  - Summary Denture stomatitis has been reported in 11?67% of complete denture wearers. It is more common on the palatal mucosa and in female patients. In Newton's type I denture stomatitis, where the inflammation remains focal, trauma seems to be responsible. In Newton's types II and III denture stomatitis, where the denture-bearing mucosa is diffusely involved, most workers assert that the aetiology is multi-factorial. Evidence is presented incriminating Candida albicans colonization of the fitting surface of the prosthesis in many cases of denture stomatitis promoted by continuous denture wearing. Allergic and primary irritant reactions to the denture base material, systemic predisposing factors including dietary deficiency and haematological disorders, also play a part. In most cases of denture stomatitis, elimination of denture faults, control of denture plaque and discontinuous denture wearing are sufficient treatment. The routine use of antiseptic or antimycotic drugs seems unnecessary.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Guidelines for the rational use of antimicrobials enable practitioners to improve antimicrobial stewardship and slow the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) [1]; these must be regionally relevant [2]. New Zealand (NZ) is geographically isolated and the importance of AMR on equine studs is unknown. Objectives To identify AMR patterns of bacteria isolated from NZ foals so as to provide regionally specific information for the development of antimicrobial stewardship guidelines. Study design Retrospective study of clinical pathology records. Methods A database search of bacterial culture submissions from foals <3 weeks of age from April 2004 to December 2013 was completed. Culture results, antimicrobial sensitivities, and demographic factors were tabulated. The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion susceptibility test was used to define sensitivity. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) was defined as non-sensitivity to 3 or more core antimicrobials in a panel (ceftiofur, enrofloxaxin, gentamicin, penicillin [not included for Gram-negative bacteria], tetracycline, trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole). Results Bacterial isolates (n?=?127) were cultured from 64/102 (62.7%) of foal submissions. Four bacterial groups (Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli) accounted for 100 (79%) of bacterial isolates cultured. At least one or 2 MDR isolates were cultured from 24 (38%) and 8 (12%) foals, respectively. Culture positive and negative foals were demographically similar. Conclusions A significant number of bacterial isolates from foals have reduced antimicrobial susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial drugs. The results are of concern from treatment and stewardship perspectives. Multi-drug resistance was found, indicating a need for regionally relevant antimicrobial use recommendations.
