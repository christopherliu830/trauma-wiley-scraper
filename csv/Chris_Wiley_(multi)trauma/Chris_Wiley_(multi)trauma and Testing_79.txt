AB  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE 2012; 19:801?807 ? 2012 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine Abstract Objectives:? Of the currently published clinical decision rules for the management of minor head injury (MHI) in children, the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) rule, derived and validated in a large multicenter prospective study cohort, with high methodologic standards, appears to be the best clinical decision rule to accurately identify children at very low risk of clinically important traumatic brain injuries (ciTBI) in the pediatric emergency department (PED). This study describes the implementation of an adapted version of the PECARN rule in a tertiary care academic PED in Italy and evaluates implementation success, in terms of medical staff adherence and satisfaction, as well as its effects on clinical practice. Methods:? The adapted PECARN decision rule algorithms for children (one for those younger than 2?years and one for those older than 2?years) were actively implemented in the PED of Padova, Italy, for a 6-month testing period. Adherence and satisfaction of medical staff to the new rule were calculated. Data from 356 visits for MHI during PECARN rule implementation and those of 288 patients attending the PED for MHI in the previous 6?months were compared for changes in computed tomography (CT) scan rate, ciTBI rate (defined as death, neurosurgery, intubation for longer than 24?hours, or hospital admission at least for two nights associated with TBI) and return visits for symptoms or signs potentially related to MHI. The safety and efficacy of the adapted PECARN rule in clinical practice were also calculated. Results:? Adherence to the adapted PECARN rule was 93.5%. The percentage of medical staff satisfied with the new rule, in terms of usefulness and ease of use for rapid decision-making, was significantly higher (96% vs. 51%, p?<?0.0001) compared to the previous, more complex, internal guideline. CT scan was performed in 30 patients (8.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI]?=?6% to 11.8%) in the implementation period versus 21 patients (7.3%, 95% CI?=?4.8% to 10.9%) before implementation. A ciTBI occurred in three children (0.8%, 95% CI?=?0.3 to 2.5) during the implementation period and in two children (0.7%, 95% CI?=?0.2 to 2.5) in the prior 6?months. There were five return visits (1.4%) postimplementation and seven (2.4%) before implementation (p?=?0.506). The safety of use of the adapted PECARN rule in clinical practice was 100% (95% CI?=?36.8 to 100; three of three patients with ciTBI who received CT scan at first evaluation), while efficacy was 92.3% (95% CI?=?89 to 95; 326 of 353 patients without ciTBI who did not receive a CT scan). Conclusions:? The adapted PECARN rule was successfully implemented in an Italian tertiary care academic PED, achieving high adherence and satisfaction of medical staff. Its use determined a low CT scan rate that was unchanged compared to previous clinical practice and showed an optimal safety and high efficacy profile. Strict monitoring is mandatory to evaluate the long-lasting benefit in patient care and/or resource utilization.

AB  - Abstract This study examined the outcome effects of cognitive match between Asian and White outpatient clients and their therapists. Many clinicians believe that one hindrance to the treatment of ethnic minority clients is that therapists and clients may not share common assumptions and attitudes about therapy and about the problems that are presented in treatment. The study investigated client?therapist similarity in their perceptions of the presenting problem, coping orientation, and expectations about treatment goals. This study constituted a more rigorous test of the cognitive match hypotheses in that it was prospective in nature, used separate and independent sources for the cognitive predictors, employed multiple outcome measures, and focused on specific attitudes and perceptions that are quite salient and relevant to treatment. Cognitive match on treatment goals was predictive of session impact. Moreover, cognitive matches in avoidant coping orientation and in perceived distress associated with interpersonal problems were predictive of certain treatment outcomes. The findings may help explain why clients matched on ethnicity with their therapists tend to stay longer in treatment and do better in psychotherapy. ? 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Myxedema coma is a decompensated state of hypothyroidism resulting from severe and prolonged depletion of thyroid hormones, leading to altered mental status and other clinical features related to widespread multi-organ dysfunction. While this is a rare condition on the spectrum of thyroid disorders, myxedema coma is considered an endocrine emergency due to the danger of increased mortality with recent rates of 20?25% reported. Therefore, it is important to promptly recognize and treat myxedema coma in an attempt to improve outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Ethical and social issues surround the issue of sexuality and parenting for people with intellectual disabilities. The traumatic history of eugenics is encapsulated in Nazi Germany's description of those with intellectual disability as unworthy of life and the 250?000 children and adults who were gassed but conscious and unconscious wishes to deny sexual and procreative rights to those with an intellectual disability is world-wide and contemporary despite legislative change. However, given the high levels of sexual abuse and exploitation that come from internal and external stigmatisation and trauma the movement towards greater human rights, sexual education and access to psychotherapy heralds new hope for children and adults with an intellectual disability and the wider community. Key Concepts: In working with people with intellectual disability on the themes of sexuality and procreation a multi-disciplinary approach is needed. Ethics, human rights, genetics and psychotherapy are all relevant in working with sexuality and procreation in people with intellectual disability. A history of trauma and eugenics is a necessary prerequisite to understanding the controversial topic of disability, sexuality and procreation. Co-operation with geneticists is important in considering procreation and disability. People with an intellectual disability have a right to their own sexuality.

AB  - Abstract The executive function (EF) theory of autism has received much support recently from a growing number of studies. However, executive impairments have not always been easy to identify consistently and so novel ?ecologically valid? tests have been designed which tap into real-life scenarios that are relevant to and representative of everyday behavior. One characteristic of many of these tasks is that they present the participant with an ?ill-structured? or ?open-ended? situation. Here, we investigated the possibility that tasks with greater degrees of open-endedness might prove more sensitive to detecting executive impairment in autism. Forty-five children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were compared to 27 age- and IQ-matched control children on a range of cognitive tests of EF. Group differences were found on half of the tasks, with the greatest degree of impairment detected on the more open-ended tasks. The ASD group also performed more poorly on a simple control condition of a task. Detailed consideration of task performance suggested that the ASD group tended to create fewer spontaneous strategies and exhibit more idiosyncratic behavior, which particularly disadvantaged them on the more open-ended tasks. These kinds of behaviors have been reported in studies of neurological patients with frontal lobe involvement, prima facie suggesting a link between the scientific fields. However, we suggest that this behavior might equally result from a poor understanding of the implicit demands made by the experimenter in open-ended test situations, due to the socio-communicative difficulties of these children.

AB  - Musk, the dried secretion of the musk pod (sac) of adult male musk deer, has been used as traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in China and south-east Asian countries for thousands of years. Due to the anabolic steroid component in this TCM, musk preparations have been included in the list of medical products containing prohibited substances employed for doping by the State Food and Drug Administration of China. The application of musk pod formulation was claimed to be responsible for some adverse analytical findings (AAFs) in the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. Our preliminary study has suggested that musk ingestion did not lead to AAFs of doping control with the single dosage of 100 mg. However, the influences of musk administration in large and multi dosage are still unclear. The aim of this study is to further investigate the influences of musk administration for doping control. Wild and domestic deer musk samples were collected. The concentrations and δ13C-values of steroids in musk were analyzed. In an excretion study, 200 and 100 mg of wild and domestic deer musk samples were administrated by 29 subjects, respectively. Fluctuations in steroid profile could be observed, and the ratio of 5α-androstane-3α,17?-diol to 5?-androstane-3α,17?-diol was more sensitive than other parameters. In the IRMS test, the ??δ13C-value between endogenous reference compound and etiocholanolone was a sensitive parameter, and AAFs were obtained. It is the first time to confirm with excretion study that musk administration could lead to positive result of doping control. Copyright ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The anatomical response of Norway spruce bark polyphenolic parenchyma cells (PP cells) to inoculation with the phytopathogenic fungus Ceratocystis polonica and attack by its bark-beetle vector Ips typographus was examined. Fungal inoculation on the periderm surface had no effect, while inoculation just below the periderm or halfway into the phloem (mid-phloem) generated detectable responses within 3 wk. The responses included increase in PP cell size and in periodic acid-Schiff's staining of PP cell phenolics, wound periderm initiation from PP cells, and cambial zone traumatic resin duct formation. Fungi were not seen in samples 3 wk after subperiderm or mid-phloem inoculation, but were found in some samples 6 and 9 wk after mid-phloem inoculation. In contrast, inoculations into the cambium resulted in partial (3 wk) or complete (6 and 9 wk) fungal colonization and death of tissue in the infected area. This indicates that PP cells have defenses capable of inhibiting fungal growth. Samples taken near bark-beetle galleries had similar anatomical responses as inoculated samples, validating the inoculation approach to studying defense responses in spruce. These results show that PP cells represent not only a constitutive defense system, but are also involved in local and remote inducible defenses against fungal and beetle attack.

AB  - Abstract Burnout, the triad of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment, begins early in medical education and the prevalence continues to increase over time among U.S. physicians. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) now requires that programs and sponsoring institutions have the same responsibility to address well-being as they do other aspects of resident competence. Yet, there are no studies published in the emergency medicine (EM) literature that discuss the development and institution of a formal wellness curriculum. The authors conducted a needs analysis among EM residents with the aim of creating a multifaceted 12-month wellness curriculum. The needs analysis determined that residents are not comfortable with their knowledge of wellness principles. In response, the authors developed a curriculum by integrating components of published non-EM wellness curricula and online academic wellness programs with commonly accepted domains of wellness. The curriculum was subsequently introduced at five EM residencies. This curriculum represents an example of successful multi-institution collaboration to meet an ACGME Common Program Requirement.

AB  - Background and Objective Low-level light therapy (LLLT) has been revealed as a potential means to improve wound healing. So far, most studies are being performed with irradiation in the red to near-infrared spectra. Recently, we showed that blue light (470?nm) can significantly influence biological systems such as nitric oxide (NO) metabolism and is able to release NO from nitrosyl-hemoglobin or mitochondrial protein complexes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the therapeutic value of blue or red light emitting diodes (LEDs) on wound healing in an ischemia disturbed rodent flap model. Study Design/Materials and Methods An abdominal flap was rendered ischemic by ligation of one epigastric bundle and subjected to LED illumination with a wavelength of 470?nm (blue, n?=?8) or 629?nm (red, n?=?8) each at 50?mW/cm2 and compared to a non-treated control group (n?=?8). Illumination was performed for 10?minutes on five consecutive days. Results LED therapy with both wavelengths significantly increased angiogenesis in the sub-epidermal layer and intramuscularly (panniculus carnosus muscle) which was associated with significantly improved tissue perfusion 7 days after the ischemic insult. Accordingly, tissue necrosis was significantly reduced and shrinkage significantly less pronounced in the LED-treated groups of both wavelengths. Conclusions LED treatment of ischemia challenged tissue improved early wound healing by enhancing angiogenesis irrespective of the wavelength thus delineating this noninvasive means as a potential, cost effective tool in complicated wounds.

AB  - Abstract The central nervous system (CNS) tissues, including the brain, the eye, and the spinal cord, are immune-privileged, secluded from the circulation by a complex of barriers, and equipped with their own myeloid cell population, the resident microglia. Based on the classical perspective of immune?brain interactions and on the contribution of such interactions to the progression of multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the CNS, infiltrating macrophages were traditionally viewed as an enemy of the nervous system. However, over the past two decades, research has revealed the pivotal role of monocyte-derived macrophages in CNS repair, and opened up a new era in understanding and treating CNS pathologies. Here, we gather current knowledge regarding macrophage broad spectrum of activities in the CNS, whose two poles correspond to the classical pro-inflammatory M1 and the ?alternatively-activated? M2 cells previously described in various non-CNS pathologies, and their diverse, multi-functional contribution in various neurological conditions, ranging from acute traumas to neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases. The diverse functions are manifested by induction and resolution of inflammation as well as their involvement in neural tissue regeneration and renewal, matrix remodelling, debris clearance, and angiogenesis. A special focus is devoted to current evidence suggesting that resident microglia and infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages are functionally non-redundant cell types. Taken together, these recent advances reveal a dramatic therapeutic opportunity for controlled harnessing of macrophages for repair of the damaged CNS following acute insults, in neurodegenerative conditions, and in psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Abstract:? This study examined the prevalence, demographic variables and adverse outcomes associated with non-adherence to post-transplant care in adolescent liver transplant recipients. We conducted a retrospective chart review of 111 adolescent patients (age 12?21?yr) greater than six months post-transplantation and defined non-adherence as not taking the immunosuppressive(s) or not attending any clinic visit in 2005. Fifty subjects (45.0%) were non-adherent and 61 (55.0%) were adherent. Twenty percent of the subjects did not attend clinic and 10.9% did not complete laboratory tests. Non-adherence was significantly associated with fewer completed laboratory tests (p?<?0.0001), single parent status (p?<?0.0186), and older age and greater years post-transplantation by both univariate and multivariate analyses (p?<?0.008, p?<?0.0141 and p?<?0.0012, p?<?0.0174, respectively). Non-adherence to medication was significantly associated with a rejection episode in 31 patients (p?<?0.0069) but not in the subgroup of seven patients who stopped their immunosuppression completely. Non-adherence to post-transplant care is a prevalent problem in adolescents particularly of an older age and greater years post-transplantation. Rejection was a significant consequence of medication non-adherence except in a subgroup with presumed graft tolerance who discontinued their immunosuppression. These results emphasize the need for strict monitoring of adherence to post-transplant care to improve long-term survival and quality of life in adolescent transplant patients.

AB  - Summary Aim Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a growing and largely underestimated problem without defined etiology. Herein, we sought to determine the relationship between cognitive decline, blood?brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and inflammation, namely high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), after surgery in aged rats. Methods Aged rats were randomly assigned as surgery group (n = 45, splenectomy under general anesthesia), anesthesia (n = 45, 2% isoflurane for 2 h), and naïve control (n = 15). Markers of inflammation were measured in plasma and brain. Blood?brain barrier ultrastructure and permeability were measured by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and IgG immunohistochemistry. Cognitive function was assessed in a reversal learning version of the Morris water maze (MWM). Results Surgical trauma under general anesthesia caused distinct changes in systemic and central proinflammatory cytokines. Levels of HMGB1 and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) were significantly upregulated in the hippocampus of operated animals. Immunohistochemistry and TEM showed BBB disruption induced by surgery and anesthesia. These molecular changes were associated with cognitive impairment in latency with the MWM up to postoperative day 3. Conclusions HMGB1 and RAGE signaling appear pivotal mediators of surgery-induced cognitive decline and may contribute to the changes in BBB permeability after peripheral surgical trauma.

AB  - Abstract This study examined posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, coping, and physical health status in students reporting a trauma history (N = 138) using structural equation modeling. Participants completed questionnaires assessing PTSD symptoms, coping specific to health-related and trauma-related stressors and physical health. After accounting for coping with health-specific problems, trauma-specific avoidance coping was uniquely associated with poorer health status. Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were associated with poorer physical health status, controlling for age, health behaviors, and other psychopathology. In addition, the effect of PTSD symptoms on poorer health status was mediated by health- and trauma-specific avoidance coping. Results suggest that university health centers should screen for PTSD and consider psychoeducational programs and coping skills interventions for survivors of trauma.

It focuses on the early and crucial qualitative aspects of questionnaire design and the four phases of development: generation of quality of life (QoL) issues; construction of the item list; pre-testing the questionnaire; and field-testing. Before embarking on developing a questionnaire, the research questions should have been formulated clearly. In the case of QoL, this will include specification of the objectives in measuring QoL, a working definition of what is meant by ?quality of life?, the identification of the intended groups of respondents, and proposals as to the aspects or main dimensions of QoL that are to be assessed. The role of qualitative methods involving not only experts but, most importantly, patients, is now well recognized. the chapter advises to consider using or building upon existing instruments rather than develop our own instrument.

AB  - Objective Disruption to endochondral ossification leads to delayed and irregular bone formation and can result in a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders known as osteochondrodysplasias. These genetic disorders arise through disturbances in the complex processes of skeletal growth causing development of unsightly skeletal deformities. Methods? Each syndrome was diagnosed on the basis of detailed clinical and radiographic assessment. Lower limb deformities were the prime presenting feature. Results Here are presented three patients with diverse genetic syndromes, namely Wolcott?Rallison syndrome (WRS), Kniest dysplasia (KD) and Desbuquois dysplasia (DS). Genetic testing was performed in the patients with WRS and DS. The diagnosis of KD was made purely on a clinical and radiographic basis. Variable orthopaedic interventions to realign these patients' lower limbs were implemented with the aim of improving their balance and gait. Conclusions The aim of this paper is twofold. The first part is to outline the importance of diagnosing the causes of various skeletal abnormalities in patients with osteochondrodysplasias by phenotypic and genotypic characterization. The second part is to demonstrate our techniques for surgical corrections in patients with joint laxity and malalignment and show how far techniques for growth modulation, re-alignment and ligament reconstruction have advanced.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) play a pivotal role in modern therapeutic approaches in bone-healing disorders. Although bone marrow-derived MSCs are most frequently used, the knowledge that many other adult tissues represent promising sources for potent MSCs has gained acceptance. In the present study, the osteogenic differentiation potential of porcine skin fibroblasts (FBs), as well as bone marrow- (BMSCs), adipose tissue- (ASCs) and dental pulp-derived stromal cells (DSCs) were evaluated. However, additional application of BMP-2 significantly elevated the delayed osteogenic differentiation capacity of ASC and FB cultures, and in DSC cultures the supplementation of platelet-rich plasma increased osteogenic differentiation potential to a comparable level of the good differentiable BMSCs. Furthermore, microarray gene expression performed in an exemplary manner for ASCs and BMSCs revealed that ASCs and BMSCs use different gene expression patterns for osteogenic differentiation under standard media conditions, as diverse MSCs are imprinted dependent from their tissue niche. However, after increasing the differentiation potential of ASCs to a comparable level as shown in BMSCs, a small subset of identical key molecules was used to differentiate in the osteogenic lineage. Until now, the importance of identified genes seems to be underestimated for osteogenic differentiation. Apparently, the regulation of transmembrane protein 229A, interleukin-33 and the fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 in the early phase of osteogenic differentiation is needed for optimum results. Based on these results, bone regeneration strategies of MSCs have to be adjusted, and in vivo studies on the osteogenic capacities of the different types of MCSs are warranted.

AB  - This article discusses Taiwan's experience in managing surge needs based on recent events, including the 1999 earthquake, severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, airliner crashes in 1998 and 2001, and yearly typhoons and floods. Management techniques are compared and contrasted with U.S. approaches. The authors discuss Taiwan's practices of sending doctors to the scene of an event and immediately recalling off-duty hospital personnel, managing volunteers, designating specialty hospitals, and use of incident management systems. The key differences in bioevents, including the mathematical myths regarding individual versus population care, division of stockpiles, the Maginot line, and multi-jurisdictional responses, are highlighted. Several recent initiatives aimed at mitigating biothreats have begun in Taiwan, but their efficacy has not yet been tested. These include the integration of the emergency medical services and health-facility medical systems with other response systems; the use of the hospital emergency incident command system; crisis risk-communications approaches; and the use of practical, hands-on training programs. Other countries may gain valuable insights for mitigating and managing biothreats by studying Taiwan's experiences in augmenting surge capacity.

AB  - Abstract Methamphetamine (MA)-related psychiatric symptoms (MAP) are serious comorbidities of MA use and result in many social problems such as violence and suicide. We investigated the sociodemographic and genetic risk factors for persistent MAP of MA users (MUs) and constructed an early MAP prediction model. Derivation and replication samples had 1734 and 905 MUs, respectively. Symptom Checklist 90, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Rating Scale-IV, and Social Support Rating Scale were used to assess the past-year prevalence of general MAP and life events retrospectively. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) was used to analyze MAP-related genetic factors. The prediction model was constructed by integrating the risk life events and clinical and genetic features using logistic regression. Of the 2639 MUs, 1293 (48.83%) had past-year MAP. The severity of MA addiction (SMA), childhood trauma, childhood ADHD symptoms, and social support were reliable risk factors for persistent MAP. By integrating these risk factors and the polygenic risk score from GWAS from derivation samples, the area under the curve (AUC) of the predictive model for MAP was 0.754 (95% CI 0.717~0.771). The risk factors and prediction model were also verified in replication samples. In addition, SMA, ADHD, and social support were mediators for the effect of the risk genetic factor on persistent MAP. Our study identified several risk factors for persistent MAP and will be helpful for developing scalable tools for the prevention of persistent and general MAP.

AB  - Background.? One of the greatest diagnostic challenges in clinical practice is the accurate assessment of pulp status. This may be further complicated in paediatric dentistry where the practitioner is faced with a developing dentition, traumatized teeth, or young children who have a limited ability to recall a pain history for the tooth in question. A variety of pulp testing approaches exist, and there may be confusion as to their validity or appropriateness in different clinical situations. Aim.? The aim of this paper is to provide the clinician with a comprehensive review of current pulp testing methods. A key objective is to highlight the difference between sensitivity testing and vitality testing. A biological basis for pulp testing is also provided to allow greater insight into the interpretation of pulp testing results. The rationale for, and methods of, assessing pulpal blood flow are described.
