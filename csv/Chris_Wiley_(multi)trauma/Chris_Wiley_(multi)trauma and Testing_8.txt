AB  - Compared to research on displaced persons whose refugee status has been endorsed prior to arriving in Western countries, there is little systematic information available about levels of past trauma, postmigration living difficulties and psychiatric symptoms amongst asylum-seekers who claim refugee status only after arrival. Asylum-seekers, authorized refugees and immigrants of Tamil background were recruited by personal contact and mail-out in Sydney, Australia. A total of 62 subjects, constituting approximately 60% of the estimated pool of Tamil asylum-seekers, agreed to participate in the study. They returned statistically significantly higher scores than immigrants (n=104) on measures of past trauma, symptoms of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress, and on all dimensions of postmigration difficulties. Asylum-seekers did not differ from refugees (n=30) on measures of past trauma or psychiatric symptoms, but they scored higher on selective components of postmigration stress relating to difficulties associated with their insecure residency status. Although limited by sampling and diagnostic constraints, the present study suggests that asylum-seekers may be a high-risk group in relation to ongoing stress in the postmigration period.

AB  - Abstract Dissemination of effective early interventions following trauma is necessary to ensure the provision of the best possible care in a timely manner. To achieve this, agreement from all key stakeholders is required regarding the messages to be disseminated and the means of dissemination. This article is based on a National Institute of Mental Health sponsored symposium on the dissemination of early interventions at the 21st annual meeting of the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies in Toronto in 2005. The current knowledge base regarding the effectiveness and dissemination of early interventions (defined here as those that are begun within the first 3 months after exposure) following trauma for children, adolescents, and adults is considered.

AB  - Objective:? Little is known about the relationship of assaultive trauma to clinical and functional outcome in patients with bipolar disorder. Method:? We assessed trauma histories in a cohort of 109 first-admission bipolar patients with psychosis using structured interviews and medical records. Assaultive trauma included rape, physical attacks, and physical threats. Outcome was assessed using standardized ratings. Results:? Forty percent reported a history of assaultive trauma, mostly in childhood (≤16?years). Exposed patients were more symptomatic at each follow-up than unexposed. Sixteen percent of exposed patients remitted after one episode compared with 38.5% of the non-exposed. Patients exposed as adults were the most symptomatic at 6?months, while patients exposed in childhood were the most symptomatic at 24?months. Conclusion:? Our findings supported the salient role of trauma history as a risk factor for poor course in severe bipolar disorder. Given the high prevalence of such exposure, clinical awareness in first-admission psychotic bipolar patients is critical.

AB  - Abstract??? The aim of this cross-sectional epidemiological survey was to assess the prevalence of dental trauma in athletes representing 42 countries competing at the most recent Pan American Games (XV Pan Am) held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in July of 2007, and to determine prior use and type of mouthguard among this group of athletes. The examiners participated in standardization and calibration training sessions before the field phase began. Invitations were sent to >5500 participating athletes competing in 41 sports and to the Medical Committee of the Pan American Sports Organization before and during the XV PAN. A convenience sample of 409 athletes was recruited. After signing an informed consent, all athletes answered a questionnaire. Data were collected at the clinical examination and recorded on a specific trauma form. The mean age of the athletes was 24.4?±?5.3?years. Males comprised 55% of the sample; females 45%. The prevalence of dental trauma among the athletes was 49.6% (n?=?203) with no gender-based differences. Most of these injuries (63.6%) were related to activities during training or competition. Sports with the highest injury prevalence were wrestling (83.3%), boxing (73.7%), basketball (70.6%) and karate (60%). The most common injury was enamel fracture (39.8%); root fracture was the least common (0.4%). The teeth most affected were the maxillary permanent central incisors (n?=?113), followed by the mandibular central incisors (n?=?19). Based on the results of this study, nearly one-half of the subjects had experienced previous dental trauma; the majority related to sports activities. Furthermore, only 17% of the athletes reported prior mouthguard use; the most frequent mouthguards reported were boil-and-bite. These results suggest the importance of enhanced educational efforts and the use of properly fitted mouthguards to reduce dental trauma among athletes in international sports competition, especially in sports where mouthguards are not mandatory.

AB  - Background: The kidney is the most frequently injured abdominal organ in children and controversy surrounds some aspects of management. This study looks at the experience of our institution and reviews the literature towards developing an optimal strategy for managing this common childhood injury. Methods: One hundred and forty-two cases of paediatric renal trauma are reported from a catchment population of approximately 240 000 children < 14 years of age over a 12 year period. Injuries were classified into four groups: groups 1 and 2 were regarded as minor injuries (85%) and group 3 and 4 injuries were those with extravasation of urine or pedicle injury (15%). Results: The male:female ratio was 2:I with an average age of 8.5 years. Major renal injuries frequently required large amounts of resuscitation fluid. Associated injuries were present in 41% of all cases with an average of two injuries each. With one exception in each case, the development of complications and the need for early surgery were confined to major injuries. There were no long-term complications. The renal loss rate was 2.1%. Conclusions: Renal injuries can be usefully classified into major or minor by determining whether extravasation of urine or pedicle injury is present. Minor injuries should be managed conservatively. Major injuries causing ongoing haemorrhage require urgent surgery. Other major injuries should be imaged regularly and patients with more severe urinomas benefit from early elective surgery at 2?5 days. In cases where extravasation of urine has not shown clear evidence of settling by 5 days' elective surgery probably results in less morbidity and fewer complications than protracted conservative treatment.

AB  - Abstract Background: Genetic polymorphisms that influence serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) neurotransmission are candidates for contributing to susceptibility to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The objective of our study was to determine if a variable length polymorphism for the promoter regions of the 5HT transporter (5HTTLPR), and/or a substitution polymorphism in the promoter region for the 5HT2A receptor, would be associated with PTSD in a trauma exposed population of adult African-Americans. Methods: Using a case control design, 118 participants recruited from the primary care clinics and the campus of a historically black university who met inclusion criteria including trauma exposure provided blood samples for genomic DNA. PTSD criteria were determined by the Clinician Assessment of PTSD Scale (CAPS) and criteria for other psychiatric disorders by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). 5HTTLPR and 5HT2A-1438A/G were genotyped using established methods. Associations of genotypes with lifetime PTSD, and models testing associations of allele ?dose?, were analyzed. Results: Fifty-five (47%) participants met lifetime criteria for PTSD and 26 (22%) met criteria for (mostly comorbid) major depression. The 5HT2A (lower expressing) G allele was significantly associated with PTSD. We did not find significant associations with 5HTTLPR. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a relationship between genetic variation in the 5HT2A promoter region and PTSD. Depression and Anxiety 26:993?997, 2009. Published 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - A timely determination of the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prerequisite for efficient service delivery and prevention. We provide a risk estimate tool allowing a calculation of individuals? PTSD likelihood from early predictors. Members of the International Consortium to Predict PTSD (ICPP) shared individual participants? item-level data from ten longitudinal studies of civilian trauma survivors admitted to acute care centers in six countries. Eligible participants (N=2,473) completed an initial clinical assessment within 60 days of trauma exposure, and at least one follow-up assessment 4-15 months later. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-IV (CAPS) evaluated PTSD symptom severity and diagnostic status at each assessment. Participants? education, prior lifetime trauma exposure, marital status and socio-economic status were assessed and harmonized across studies. The study's main outcome was the likelihood of a follow-up PTSD given early predictors. The prevalence of follow-up PTSD was 11.8% (9.2% for male participants and 16.4% for females). A logistic model using early PTSD symptom severity (initial CAPS total score) as a predictor produced remarkably accurate estimates of follow-up PTSD (predicted vs. raw probabilities: r=0.976). Adding respondents? female gender, lower education, and exposure to prior interpersonal trauma to the model yielded higher PTSD likelihood estimates, with similar model accuracy (predicted vs. raw probabilities: r=0.941). The current model could be adjusted for other traumatic circumstances and accommodate risk factors not captured by the ICPP (e.g., biological, social). In line with their use in general medicine, risk estimate models can inform clinical choices in psychiatry. It is hoped that quantifying individuals? PTSD risk will be a first step towards systematic prevention of the disorder.

Due to the poor goodness of fit of the two-factor model and the post hoc EFA resulting in a one-factor model, our data do not support the findings of Aparicio et al. (2013). Further, the findings suggest the VTS is an acceptable measure of vicarious trauma, as demonstrated by the high internal consistency and the single-factor loading.

AB  - Introduction Haemophilia is one of the most common inherited bleeding disorders in the Emergency Department (ED). The most dangerous site of bleeding is the central nervous system. Aims To describe the characteristics of haemophiliacs arrived to our ED following a head trauma and to analyse the incidence of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH). Materials and Methods Retrospective, analytical, observational study, conducted in a Paediatric ED. We included haemophilic patients aged from birth to 16 years who consulted after a head trauma over a 6-year period. Data collected included age, type of haemophilia and head trauma, symptoms, prophylaxis status, CT imaging, treatment and number of visits to the ED. Results About 46 males and 85 episodes were analysed. The median age was 2.38 years. Severe haemophilia A was the most frequent type of disease (50%). All head injuries were mild, and the most frequent mechanism was a collision with an object (38.8%). In 62 episodes (72.9%) the patients were asymptomatic. The rest 23 events had symptomatology, being the most common headache (26%), emesis (21.7%) and drowsiness (17.4%). Head CT was obtained in 31 episodes, founding altered results in 10 (6 of them corresponding to ICH). All the patients with ICH had symptomatology. About 37 episodes required admission. Conclusion Intracranial haemorrhage is one of the most dangerous events in haemophiliacs and it may occur after a head trauma. Our study suggests that, in case of head trauma, CT must be obtained in symptomatic patients and in those with additional risk factors. Asymptomatic patients must have prolonged observation.

AB  - Summary Viscoelastic assays such as TEG? and ROTEM? are increasingly used to guide transfusion of blood products. The EXTEM assay maximum clot firmness (MCF) is a ROTEM measure available after 25?29 min used to guide early decisions. EXTEM A10, the clot firmness at 10 min, is an accepted early surrogate, but investigators differ on whether A5, the clot firmness at 5 min, is acceptable. We re-examined this in a retrospective observational analysis of 1146 trauma patients in one centre who had ROTEM data recorded. A5 and A10 both correlated well with maximum clot firmness, with Pearson coefficients of r = 0.92 and r = 0.96, respectively. The correlations of A5, A10 and maximum clot firmness with requirement for massive transfusion were all similarly high, with c-stats of 0.87, 0.89 and 0.90, respectively. The correlations with mortality were also similar but weaker, with c-stats of 0.67, 0.69 and 0.69, respectively. Using a previously validated cut-off of A5 < 35 mm to predict massive transfusion gave a sensitivity of 95%, specificity 83%, positive predictive value 9.3% and negative predictive value 100%. Using a value of A5 < 29 mm, for a pragmatic positive predictive value of 20%, gave a sensitivity of 67%, specificity 95% and negative predictive value 99%. Whether aiming for a high sensitivity or a strong predictive value, A5 was non-inferior to A10 and actually missed fewer cases needing massive transfusion. A5 has similar utility to both A10 and maximum clot firmness as an early measure of clot firmness, and a low A5 value is strongly predictive of the need for massive transfusion.

AB  - Trauma resuscitation is a complex situation, and most organisations have multi-professional trauma teams. Non-technical skills are challenged during trauma resuscitation, and they play an important role in the prevention of critical incidents. Simulation-based training of these is recommended. Our research question was: Does simulation-based trauma team training of non-technical skills have effect on reaction, learning, behaviour or patient outcome? The authors searched PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library and found 13 studies eligible for analysis. We described and compared the educational interventions and the evaluations of effect according to the four Kirkpatrick levels: reaction, learning (knowledge, skills, attitudes), behaviour (in a clinical setting) and patient outcome. No studies were randomised, controlled and blinded, resulting in a moderate to high risk of bias. The multi-professional trauma teams had positive reactions to simulation-based training of non-technical skills. Knowledge and skills improved in all studies evaluating the effect on learning. Three studies found improvements in team performance (behaviour) in the clinical setting. One of these found difficulties in maintaining these skills. Two studies evaluated on patient outcome, of which none showed improvements in mortality, complication rate or duration of hospitalisation. A significant effect on learning was found after simulation-based training of the multi-professional trauma team in non-technical skills. Three studies demonstrated significantly increased clinical team performance. No effect on patient outcome was found. All studies had a moderate to high risk of bias. More comprehensive randomised studies are needed to evaluate the effect on patient outcome.

AB  - Traumatic injury and its sequelae remain a major, unrecognized public health problem in North America. Traumatic injury is the principal cause of death in patients aged 1-44 years and the overall leading cause of life-years lost in the United States. Recognizing this, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), in conjunction with other federal agencies, organized a conference in June 2000 to discuss the basic and clinical research needs that could lead to improved outcomes following cardiopulmonary or post injury resuscitation. The Post Resuscitative and Initial Utility of Life Saving Efforts (PULSE) Workshop resulted and eight work groups were established to focus on various aspects, including organ systems, pharmacology, epidemiology, and trauma. The Trauma Work Group recommendations are presented in this article. Despite the recognition of improved survival and outcome through advancements in trauma systems and trauma care, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) support ratio for trauma research is only 0.10, compared with 1.65 for cancer research and a remarkable 3.51 for AIDS and HIV infection research. The successful federal HIV research program has significantly decreased the morbidity and mortality over the last ten years at a cost of $1.4 billion per year. A coordinated trauma research program should aim to replicate the success achieved by such programs; however, a centralized federal ?home? for trauma research does not exist. Consequently, the existing limited research support is derived from NIH institutes in addition to other federal and state agencies. This report serves to describe some of the obstacles and outline various strategies and priorities for basic science, clinical, and translational trauma resuscitation research.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic experiences are common and linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, yet the mechanisms underlying these relationships is less well understood. Few studies have examined trauma exposure and its relation to autonomic influence over cardiac function, a potential pathway linking trauma exposure to CVD risk. Investigating autonomic influence over cardiac function during both wake and sleep is critical, given particular links of sleep autonomic function to cardiovascular health. Among midlife women, we tested whether trauma exposure would be related to lower high frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), an index of vagal influence over cardiac function, during wake and sleep. Three hundred and one nonsmoking midlife women completed physical measures, a 24-hr electrocardiogram, actigraphy sleep measurement, and questionnaires about trauma (Brief Trauma Questionnaire), childhood abuse (Child Trauma Questionnaire [CTQ]), mood, demographics, and medical/psychiatric history. Relations between trauma and HF-HRV were assessed in linear mixed effects models adjusting for covariates (age, race, education, body mass index, blood pressure, psychiatric history, medication use, sleep, mood, childhood abuse history). Results indicated that most women had experienced trauma. Any trauma exposure as well as a greater number of traumatic experiences were associated with lower HF-HRV during wake and particularly during sleep. Relations were not accounted for by covariates. Among midlife women, trauma exposure was related to lower HF-HRV during wake and sleep. Trauma may have an important impact on vagal influence over the heart, particularly during sleep. Decreased vagal influence over cardiac function may be a key mechanism by which trauma is associated with CVD risk.

AB  - Abstract? Background: Rupture of the innominate artery is the second most common intrathoracic arterial injury from blunt trauma. It is frequently accompanied by major trauma to other organs. The traditional management is expeditious surgical repair. Methods: Three patients presented to the Emergency Department after motor vehicle collisions with traumatic rupture of the innominate artery from 2001 to 2003. One patient presented with an isolated innominate artery injury. The other two patients presented with multi-system trauma. All patients underwent surgical repair; however, repair was individualized in each case. Results: Diagnosis was obtained via arteriography in all patients after the admission chest radiographs suggested mediastinal injury. In the patient with isolated traumatic innominate artery rupture, urgent repair was performed. In the remaining two, the repair was intentionally delayed (hospital day 4 and 19) until they stabilized or recovered from other injuries or complications. In one of these patients, repair was delayed after an endovascular repair failed. In both patients who underwent delayed repair, mean arterial pressure was maintained at <70 mmHg with beta-blockade. All patients underwent repair without cardiopulmonary bypass and were monitored for adequate cerebral perfusion pressures by measuring the right carotid artery stump pressure. Successful repair was achieved in all the three patients without postoperative complications or mortality. Conclusions: Rupture of the innominate artery from blunt trauma is an infrequent but life-threatening injury that mandates repair. In patients with isolated injuries, prompt intervention is warranted. However, intentional delayed repair may be a practical alternative for those patients with multi-system trauma.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives This research was conducted with the aim of investigating the accuracy of the shock index (SI) in distinguishing which multiple-trauma patients should be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) after treatment in an emergency room (ER). Background The SI is an easily obtained indicator, as it corresponds to an arithmetic ratio between the two parameters that are always measured during the first-aid treatment of multiple-trauma patients: heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). There are many studies examining the SI in the multiple-trauma patients as a possible predictor of the destination unit. The SI is evaluated both at the trauma scene (pre-hospital SI-pH) and in the emergency room (SI-ER). Design and methods An observational study with a retrospective approach was conducted on 158 adult patients with multiple trauma. Results The mean SI-pH and SI-ER values were higher in ICU patients than in-patients discharged or admitted to a normal ward, but the difference between these two patient groups was significant only for the SI-ER. Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed that only the SI-ER is significant as a reliable indicator for ICU admission with a best cut-off of 1·05. However, a threshold value of 0·75 was still able to establish the correct type of destination for multiple-trauma patients, with a sensitivity of 57·3% and a specificity of 62·5%. Conclusions This research showed that the SI-pH and SI-ER values are correlated, but only the SI-ER has shown statistical significance in terms of distinguishing the type of destination of multiple-trauma patient (ICU, ordinary ward or discharge) after initial treatment in the ER. Relevance to clinical practice The results of this study suggest the possibility of using SI in multiple-trauma patients as a triage indicator to assess the patients' care complexity and to guide the choice of proper clinical paths.

AB  - Abstract Paediatric abusive head injury may have grave consequences, especially when characterized by repetitive acceleration?deceleration forces (shaken baby syndrome). Death occurs in approximately 30% and permanent neurologic damage in up to 80% of the victims. Retinal haemorrhages are a cardinal sign seen in approximately 85% of cases. In most cases haemorrhages are preretinal, intraretinal and subretinal, too numerous to count, and involving the entire retinal surface extending to the ora serrata. Traumatic macular retinoschisis is a lesion with important diagnostic significance. Vitreoretinal traction appears to be the mechanism of haemorrhage and schisis formation along with a possible role of orbital tissue trauma from repetitive acceleration?deceleration forces. Ophthalmologists must carefully document ocular findings. Appropriate autopsy examination should include ocular and orbital tissue removal. Although there is a wide differential diagnosis for retinal haemorrhages, clinical appearance, when considered in the context of systemic and laboratory findings, usually leads to the correct diagnosis.

Cohen G, Campbell PM, Rossouw PE, Buschang PH Purpose??? To experimentally determine the effects of increased surgical trauma on the rates of tooth movement and apical root resorption. Two surgical techniques for rapid protraction of multi-rooted teeth in foxhound dogs immediately following premolar extraction were compared. Methods??? Split-mouth design to randomly assign two surgical techniques [periodontal ligament distraction (RAP side) and a modified form of dentoalveolar distraction (RAP+ side)] to the maxillary quadrants. First premolars were extracted, and second premolars were protracted 0.5?mm per day for 15?days using a custom made jack-screw distractor. Serial caliper and radiographic measurements were performed to quantify tooth movements and apical root resorption. Results??? Both techniques demonstrated significant movement of the crown and apex. The second premolar crowns were protracted significantly more on the RAP+ side (2.9?mm) than on the RAP (1.8?mm) side. The premolars on both sides demonstrated significant tipping (4.3 and 3.9 degrees for the RAP+ and RAP sides, respectively). The distal root apex showed almost twice as much apical root resorption than the mesial root apex, but resorption was limited (<0.16?mm) and not statistically different between sides. Conclusions??? Increased surgical trauma increased the rate and, ultimately, the amount of tooth movement. The heavy forces used to protract the teeth produced statistically, but not clinically, significant apical root resorption on the mesial and distal roots of the maxillary second premolars.

AB  - Abstract Trauma involving the dentoalveolar region is a frequent occurrence which can result in the fracturing and displacement of teeth, crushing and/or fracturing of bone and soft tissue injuries including contusions, abrasions and lacerations. This review describes the assessment of patients with these injuries, not in a didactic sense by repeating excellent already published classifications and treatment options, but by addressing questions that arise during assessment. It covers trauma first aid, examination of the patient, factors that affect treatment planning decisions, and the importance of communicating treatment options and prognosis to traumatized patients.
