AB  - Abstract Methamphetamine (MA)-related psychiatric symptoms (MAP) are serious comorbidities of MA use and result in many social problems such as violence and suicide. We investigated the sociodemographic and genetic risk factors for persistent MAP of MA users (MUs) and constructed an early MAP prediction model. Derivation and replication samples had 1734 and 905 MUs, respectively. Symptom Checklist 90, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Rating Scale-IV, and Social Support Rating Scale were used to assess the past-year prevalence of general MAP and life events retrospectively. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) was used to analyze MAP-related genetic factors. The prediction model was constructed by integrating the risk life events and clinical and genetic features using logistic regression. Of the 2639 MUs, 1293 (48.83%) had past-year MAP. The severity of MA addiction (SMA), childhood trauma, childhood ADHD symptoms, and social support were reliable risk factors for persistent MAP. By integrating these risk factors and the polygenic risk score from GWAS from derivation samples, the area under the curve (AUC) of the predictive model for MAP was 0.754 (95% CI 0.717~0.771). The risk factors and prediction model were also verified in replication samples. In addition, SMA, ADHD, and social support were mediators for the effect of the risk genetic factor on persistent MAP. Our study identified several risk factors for persistent MAP and will be helpful for developing scalable tools for the prevention of persistent and general MAP.

AB  - A 10-year-old male German shepherd dog was referred for evaluation of a cranial cervical mass causing progressively worsening respiratory distress. A fine-needle aspirate of the mass was obtained and the cytology results were compatible with a carcinoma. The dog underwent chemotherapy without clinical improvement and was ultimately euthanased because of clinical deterioration. At post-mortem examination, an irregular multi-lobated mass in the cranial cervical region was observed causing ventro-lateral tracheal deviation. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry revealed a mixed population of CD3 lymphocytes and macrophages in an exuberant fibrous stroma, associated with dispersed cytokeratin-positive epithelial cells with marked eosinophilic cytoplasm. Some of the epithelial cells were arranged in concentric clusters that were interpreted as Hassall's corpuscles. Histopathological examination of the thyroid gland revealed several neoplastic emboli composed of epithelial cells similar to those observed in the cervical mass. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of an ectopic cervical thymic carcinoma in a dog.

AB  - Multi-motivational theories of human relatedness state that different motivational systems with an evolutionary basis modulate interpersonal relationships. The reliable assessment of their dynamics may usefully inform the understanding of the therapeutic relationship. The coding system of the Assessing Interpersonal Motivation in Transcripts (AIMIT) allows to identify in the clinical the activity of five main interpersonal motivational systems (IMSs): attachment (care-seeking), caregiving, ranking, sexuality and peer cooperation. To assess whether the criteria currently used to score the AIMIT are consistently correlated with the conceptual formulation of the interpersonal multi-motivational theory, two different studies were designed. Study 1: Content validity as assessed by highly qualified independent raters. Study 2: Content validity as assessed by unqualified raters. Results of study 1 show that out of the total 60 AIMIT verbal criteria, 52 (86.7%) met the required minimum degree of correspondence. The average semantic correspondence scores between these items and the related IMSs were quite good (overall mean: 3.74, standard deviation: 0.61). In study 2, a group of 20 naïve raters had to identify each prevalent motivation (IMS) in a random sequence of 1000 utterances drawn from therapy sessions. Cohen's Kappa coefficient was calculated for each rater with reference to each IMS and then calculated the average Kappa for all raters for each IMS. All average Kappa values were satisfactory (>0.60) and ranged between 0.63 (ranking system) and 0.83 (sexuality system). Data confirmed the overall soundness of AIMIT's theoretical?applicative approach. Results are discussed, corroborating the hypothesis that the AIMIT possesses the required criteria for content validity. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Case We investigated the usefulness of multidetector computed tomography during examination in the emergency department to detect the location of press-through packages that had been inadvertently swallowed. In three patients, four press-through packages were detected on multi-planar reconstruction of multidetector computed tomography images, with three lodged in the esophagus and one in the stomach. Outcome The multidetector computed tomography detection rate of press-through packages was 100% in patients who realized they had swallowed the packages by mistake. After diagnosis, press-through packages in the esophagus were immediately removed endoscopically. Conclusion There are few reports on the usefulness of multi-planar reconstruction images by multidetector computed tomography during examinations in the emergency department for the diagnosis of foreign bodies in patients who have mistakenly swallowed press-through packages. Detecting the location of the packages provided useful information regarding the strategy for their removal. Therefore, proactive multidetector computed tomography use in the emergency department could be beneficial for patients who have inadvertently swallowed press-through packages.

AB  - Objectives The objective of this study was to compare hospitalisation duration, survival times, adverse events and cost of therapy in dogs with presumptive primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia undergoing therapy with mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids versus cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Methods A retrospective study of medical case records of dogs with presumed primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia was conducted. Data collected included signalment, presenting complaints, haematologic and biochemical profiles, vector-borne disease testing, thoracic and abdominal radiographs, abdominal ultrasound, medications administered, duration of hospitalisation, 30- and 60-day survival, adverse events and cost of therapy. Variables were compared between dogs treated solely with mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids or cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Results A total of 55 dogs with primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia were identified. Eighteen were excluded because multiple immunosuppressive medications were used during treatment. Hospitalisation times, 30-day survival and 60-day survival times were similar between both groups. Dogs in the mycophenolate mofetil/corticosteroid group experienced fewer adverse events than the cyclosporine/corticosteroid group. Therapy with mycophenolate mofetil was less expensive than that with cyclosporine. Clinical Significance These results suggest that using the combination of mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids appears to be as effective as cyclosporine and corticosteroids in the treatment of presumed primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia in dogs. Adverse events were less common and cost of therapy was lower in the mycophenolate mofetil group. Additional larger prospective, controlled, double-masked, outcome-based, multi-institutional studies are required to substantiate these preliminary findings.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Disasters occur more frequently. Acute care providers are the first to respond to mass emergencies from the healthcare sector. The preparedness of acute care providers in New Zealand to respond to mass emergencies has not been previously studied. Objective To assess the self-reported training and experience of New Zealand acute care providers to respond to mass emergencies and the factors associated with strong preparedness. Methods A cross-sectional national survey of 1500 acute care providers in New Zealand carried out between 2009 and 2010. The survey assessed experience, training and self-reported preparedness. It also determined the factors associated with strong perceived preparedness. Results The response rate to this survey was 60.7%. Nurses had a higher response rate than doctors or paramedics. Only 29.2% of acute care providers reported responding to a previous mass emergency event. There were 53.5% of acute care providers who reported having formal training in how to deal with mass emergencies, whereas 58.1% of participants reported that they were aware of their role during a healthcare mass emergency response. The factors associated with self-reported strong preparedness to deal with mass emergencies included: being a paramedic, previous training, participation in a drill, willingness to report to work during an infection or man-made emergency, ability to triage and general awareness of the role during a mass emergency. Conclusion Almost half of New Zealand acute healthcare providers have no training in dealing with mass emergency events. Training and general awareness of the role during a mass emergency response were the main factors associated with strong self-reported preparedness of acute care providers. The apparent efficacy of training allied to lack of availability means that it should be a national priority.

AB  - Abstract The clinical translation of promising basic biomedical findings, whether derived from reductionist studies in academic laboratories or as the product of extensive high-throughput and high-content screens in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, has reached a period of stagnation in which ever higher research and development costs are yielding ever fewer new drugs. Systems biology and computational modeling have been touted as potential avenues by which to break through this logjam. However, few mechanistic computational approaches are used in a manner that is fully cognizant of the inherent clinical realities in which the drugs developed through this ostensibly rational process will be ultimately used. This article presents a translational systems biology approach to inflammation. This approach is based on the use of mechanistic computational modeling centered on inherent clinical applicability, namely that a unified suite of models can be applied to generate in silico clinical trials, individualized computational models as tools for personalized medicine, and rational drug and device design based on disease mechanism.

AB  - Nine dogs with panniculitis due to rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) were examined over 17 years. Dogs were two to 15 years; five were male, four were female. All were obese or in good condition. Antecedent injury, typically a dog bite or vehicular trauma, could be identified in some patients, while one bitch had hyperadrenocorticism. Infections involved different locations, although the cervicothoracic region, dorsum or flank were most often affected. Patients were systemically well, apart from one dog with pyrexia and two with pain or lameness. Cytology demonstrated pyogranulomatous inflammation, but in only one case was it possible to see acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in smears. Histology demonstrated chronic active pyogranulomatous panniculitis and dermatitis; AFB could be detected in only four specimens. Culture of aspirates or resected tissues demonstrated RGM in all cases, comprising six Mycobacterium smegmatis group and three Mycobacterium fortuitum group isolates. Resection of infected tissues, perioperative injectable antimicrobials and long courses of oral antimicrobials chosen according to susceptibility data generally effected a cure, although some cases recurred.

AB  - Hurricane Katrina brought to the surface serious questions about the capacity of the public health system to respond to community-wide disaster. The storm and its aftermath severed developmentally protective family and community ties; thus its consequences are expected to be particularly acute for vulnerable adolescents. Research confirms that teens are at risk for a range of negative outcomes under conditions of life stress and family disorganization. Specifically, the multiple interacting risk factors for substance abuse in adolescence may be compounded when families and communities have experienced a major trauma. Further, existing service structures and treatments for working with young disaster victims may not address their risk for co-occurring substance abuse and traumatic stress reactions because they tend to be individually or peer group focused, and fail to consider the multi-systemic aspects of disaster recovery. This article proposes an innovative family-based intervention for young disaster victims, based on an empirically supported model for adolescent substance abuse, Multidimensional Family Therapy (MDFT; Liddle, 2002). Outcomes and mechanisms of the model?s effects are being investigated in a randomized clinical trial with clinically referred substance-abusing teens in a New Orleans area community impacted by Hurricane Katrina.

AB  - Objective To determine whether brain amyloid burden in elderly patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is lower than in controls, and to assess in patients with NT1 the relationships between amyloid burden, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) markers of Alzheimer disease (AD), CSF orexin-A, and cognitive profile. Methods Cognitive and 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) data were compared in patients with NT1 aged?≥?65 years (n?=?23) and in age- and sex-matched controls free of clinical dementia selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; n?=?69) and the Multi-Domain Intervention Alzheimer's Prevention Trial (MAPT-18F AV45-PET; n?=?23) cohorts. The standardized uptake values (SUVs) of the cortical retention index for 6 regions of interest were computed and averaged to create a mean SUV ratio normalized to 3 subcortical reference regions (cerebellum, pons, and a composite region). A cortical/cerebellum SUV ratio?≥?1.17 defined positive PET amyloid. Results Lower cortical amyloid burden was observed in the NT1 than in the ADNI and MAPT-AV45 groups (mean cortical/cerebellum SUV ratios?=?0.95?±?0.15, 1.11?±?0.18 [p?<?0.0001], and 1.14?±?0.17 [p?=?0.0005], respectively). Similar results were obtained with all subcortical reference regions and for all cortical regions of interest, except cingulum. Only 1 patient with NT1 (4.4%) had positive PET amyloid compared with 27.5% in the ADNI and 30.4% in the MAPT-AV45 group. In the NT1 group, cortical or regional amyloid load was not associated with CSF orexin-A, CSF AD biomarkers, or neuropsychological profile. Interpretation Lower brain amyloid burden, assessed by 18F-florbetapir PET, in patients with NT1 suggests delayed appearance of amyloid plaques. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:74?83.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: (i) To examine the association between self-reported mechanical factors and chronic oro-facial pain. (ii) To test the hypothesis that this relationship could be explained by (a) reporting of psychological factors (b) common association of self-reported mechanical factors with other unexplained syndromes. Methods: A population based cross-sectional study of 4200 randomly selected adults registered with a General Medical Practice in North West, England. The study examined the association of chronic oro-facial pain with a variety of self-reported mechanical factors: teeth grinding, facial trauma, missing teeth and the feeling that the teeth did not fit together properly. Information was also collected on demographic factors, psychological factors and the reporting of other frequently unexplained syndromes. Results: An adjusted response rate of 72% was achieved. Only two mechanical factors: teeth grinding (odds ratio (OR) 2.0, 95% CI 1.3?3.0) and facial trauma (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.3?2.9) were independently associated with chronic oro-facial pain after adjusting for psychological factors. However, these factors were also commonly associated with the reporting of other frequently unexplained syndromes: teeth grinding (odds ratio (OR) 1.8, 95% CI 1.5?2.2), facial trauma (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.7?2.6). Conclusions: Self-reported mechanical factors associated with chronic oro-facial pain are confounded, in part, by psychological factors and are equally common across other frequently unexplained syndromes. They may represent another feature of somatisation. Therefore the use of extensive invasive therapy such as occlusal adjustments and surgery to change mechanical factors may not be justified in many cases.

AB  - Abstract The round window membrane (RWM) has become the preferred route, over cochleostomy, for the introduction of cochlear implant electrodes as it minimizes inner ear trauma. However, in the absence of a tool designed for creating precise perforation, current practices lead to tearing of the RWM and significant intracochlear pressure fluctuations. On the basis of RWM mechanical properties, we have designed a multi-serrated needle to create consistent holes without membrane tearing or damaging inner ear structures. Four and eight-serrated needles were designed and produced with wire electrical discharge machining (EDM). The needle's ability to create RWM perforations was tested in deidentified, commercially acquired temporal bones with the assistance of a micromanipulator. Subsequently, specimens were imaged under light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The needles created consistent, appropriately sized holes in the membrane with minimal tearing. While a four-serrated crown needle made rectangular/trapezoid perforations, the octagonal crown formed smooth oval holes within the membrane. Though designed for single use, the needle tolerated repeated use without significant damage. The serrated needles formed precise perforations in the RWM while minimizing damage during cochlear implantation. The octagonal needle design created the preferred oval perforation better than the quad needle. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part A: 104A: 1633?1637, 2016.

AB  - Polymicrobial sepsis is associated with immunosuppression caused by the predominance of anti-inflammatory mediators and profound loss of lymphocytes through apoptosis. Dendritic cells (DC) are potent antigen-presenting cells and play a key role in T cell activation. We tested the hypothesis that DC are involved in sepsis-mediated immunosuppression in a mouse cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model, which resembles human polymicrobial sepsis. At different time-points after CLP, DC from the spleen and peripheral lymph nodes were characterized in terms of expression of costimulatory molecules, cytokine synthesis, and subset composition. Splenic DC strongly up-regulated CD86 and CD40 but not CD80 as soon as 8 h after CLP. In contrast, lymph node DC equally increased the expression of CD86, CD40, and CD80. However, this process of maturation occurred later in the lymph nodes than in the spleen. Splenic DC from septic mice were unable to secrete interleukin (IL)-12, even upon stimulation with CpG or lipopolysaccharide + CD40 ligand, but released high levels of IL-10 in comparison to DC from control mice. Neutralization of endogenous IL-10 could not restore IL-12 secretion by DC of septic mice. In addition, the splenic CD4+CD8? and CD4?CD8+ subpopulations were lost during sepsis, and the remaining DC showed a reduced capacity for allogeneic T cell activation associated with decreased IL-2 synthesis. Thus, during sepsis, splenic DC acquire a state of aberrant responsiveness to bacterial stimuli, and two DC subtypes are selectively lost. These changes in DC behavior might contribute to impaired host response against bacteria during sepsis.

AB  - Summary The functional ability of the anorectum to maintain continence is best assessed by a provocative assessment of continence to a standard load of rectally infused saline. Faecal incontinence is not caused by one condition. The combination of multiport anorectal manometry, electrophysiology and rectal sensory testing can identify several causes, which logically require different treatments. Only time and carefully conducted trials will establish whether such functional testing will be useful.

AB  - Abstract Aims Exposure to extraordinary traumatic experience is one acknowledged risk factor for drug use. We aim to analyse the influence of potentially life-changing childhood stressors, experienced second-hand, on later drug use disorder in a national population of Swedish adolescent and young adults (aged 15?26 years). Design We performed Cox proportional hazard regression analyses, complemented with co-relative pair comparisons. Setting Sweden. Participants All individuals in the Swedish population born 1984?95, who were registered in Sweden at the end of the calendar year that they turned 14 years of age. Our follow-up time (mean 6.2 years; range 11 years) started at the year they turned 15 and continued to December 2011 (n?=?1?409?218). Measurements Our outcome variable was drug use disorder, identified from medical, legal and pharmacy registry records. Childhood stressors, as per DSM-IV stressor criteria, include death of an immediate family member and second-hand experience of diagnoses of malignant cancer, serious accidental injury and victim of assault. Other covariates include parental divorce, familial psychological wellbeing and familial drug and alcohol use disorders. Findings After adjustment for all considered confounders, individuals exposed to childhood stressors ?parental death? or ?parental assault? had more than twice the risk of drug use disorder than those who were not [hazard ratio (HR)?=?2.63 (2.23?3.09) and 2.39 (2.06?2.79), respectively]. Conclusions Children aged under 15 years who experience second-hand an extraordinary traumatic event (such as a parent or sibling being assaulted, diagnosed with cancer or dying) appear to have approximately twice the risk of developing a drug use disorder than those who do not.

AB  - The aim of this prospective cohort study was to investigate the risk of acute injuries among youth male and female footballers playing on third-generation artificial turf compared with grass. Over 60?000 players 13?19 years of age were followed in four consecutive Norway Cup tournaments from 2005 to 2008. Injuries were recorded prospectively by the team coaches throughout each tournament. The overall incidence of injuries was 39.2 (SD: 0.8) per 1000 match hours; 34.2 (SD: 2.4) on artificial turf and 39.7 (SD: 0.8) on grass. After adjusting for the potential confounders age and gender, there was no difference in the overall risk of injury [odds ratio (OR): 0.93 (0.77?1.12), P=0.44] or in the risk of time loss injury [OR: 1.05 (0.68?1.61), P=0.82] between artificial turf and grass. However, there was a lower risk of ankle injuries [OR: 0.59 (0.40?0.88), P=0.008], and a higher risk of back and spine [OR: 1.92 (1.10?3.36), P=0.021] and shoulder and collarbone injuries [OR: 2.32 (1.01?5.31), P=0.049], on artificial turf compared with on grass. In conclusion, there was no difference in the overall risk of acute injury in youth footballers playing on third-generation artificial turf compared with grass.
