AB  - Objectives: To review aetiology, clinical signs and outcome of cats surgically treated for septic peritonitis (2000-2007). Methods: A retrospective study. Inclusion criteria were the identification of intracellular bacteria and degenerate neutrophils and/or a positive culture from abdominal fluid and exploratory coeliotomy. Aetiology, clinical signs, haematological and biochemical parameters, surgical treatment and outcome were recorded and analysed. Results: Twenty-six cats fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Abdominal pain was reported in 10 (38 per cent) and vomiting was reported in 11 (42 per cent) of the cats. The most common aetiology was trauma (31 per cent). The principal source of contamination was the gastrointestinal tract. Hyperlactataemia, hypoproteinaemia and hyperglycaemia were reported in 9, 13 and 14 of the 26 cases, respectively. Non-survivors had significantly higher blood lactate concentrations than survivors (P=0·02). Nineteen cats were managed with primary closure, two with closed suction drains and three with open peritoneal drainage. Twelve (46 per cent) cats survived to discharge. Clinical Significance: In cats, lethargy, depression and anorexia were more common clinical signs than abdominal pain. Lactate level at the time of diagnosis may be a useful prognostic indicator in cats. The proportion of cats that survived was lower than previously reported and owners should be given a guarded prognosis.

AB  - Objective? To determine the effects of 2 different, commonly used surfaces with different coefficients of friction on ground reaction forces in normal dogs. Study Design? Prospective, observational, single cross-over study. Animals? Dogs (n=10) with no gait abnormalities. Methods? Dogs were acclimated to the force plate and 5 valid trials for each dog and each limb were recorded. Velocity and acceleration were tightly controlled. Each dog was tested on both surfaces sequentially in different sequences. Data analysis was done on peak vertical force, peak impulse, breaking and propulsion peak forces and impulses. Three-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to separately evaluate the effect of floor type on force plate measures in fore and hind limbs, while controlling for side (left versus right) and experimental replicate. P-values<.05 were considered significant. Mean force and 95% confidence interval for the 6 variables analyzed for all limbs on each surface were calculated. Results? There were no significant differences in ground reaction forces between the linoleum and the carpet surface for thoracic or pelvic limbs for all gait variables measured. There were no significant differences between each individual gait trial per dog between the right and left thoracic limbs trials nor differences between the right and left pelvic limb trials. Conclusions? Normal dogs had no change in their ground reaction forces on linoleum and carpet surfaces. Clinical Relevance? Kinetic results from multi-center or comparative trials will not be affected by use of either linoleum or carpet surfaces.

AB  - Polymicrobial sepsis is associated with immunosuppression caused by the predominance of anti-inflammatory mediators and profound loss of lymphocytes through apoptosis. Dendritic cells (DC) are potent antigen-presenting cells and play a key role in T cell activation. We tested the hypothesis that DC are involved in sepsis-mediated immunosuppression in a mouse cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model, which resembles human polymicrobial sepsis. At different time-points after CLP, DC from the spleen and peripheral lymph nodes were characterized in terms of expression of costimulatory molecules, cytokine synthesis, and subset composition. Splenic DC strongly up-regulated CD86 and CD40 but not CD80 as soon as 8 h after CLP. In contrast, lymph node DC equally increased the expression of CD86, CD40, and CD80. However, this process of maturation occurred later in the lymph nodes than in the spleen. Splenic DC from septic mice were unable to secrete interleukin (IL)-12, even upon stimulation with CpG or lipopolysaccharide + CD40 ligand, but released high levels of IL-10 in comparison to DC from control mice. Neutralization of endogenous IL-10 could not restore IL-12 secretion by DC of septic mice. In addition, the splenic CD4+CD8? and CD4?CD8+ subpopulations were lost during sepsis, and the remaining DC showed a reduced capacity for allogeneic T cell activation associated with decreased IL-2 synthesis. Thus, during sepsis, splenic DC acquire a state of aberrant responsiveness to bacterial stimuli, and two DC subtypes are selectively lost. These changes in DC behavior might contribute to impaired host response against bacteria during sepsis.

KW  - Biofilm Meeting
KW  - Local Antibiotics
KW  - Musculoskeletal Infection (MSKI)
AB  - Abstract Antibiotic-loaded bone cement (ALBC) is broadly used to treat orthopaedic infections based on the rationale that high-dose local delivery is essential to eradicate biofilm-associated bacteria. However, ALBC formulations are empirically based on drug susceptibility from routine laboratory testing, which is known to have limited clinical relevance for biofilms. There are also dosing concerns with non-standardized, surgeon-directed, hand-mixed formulations, which have unknown release kinetics. Based on our knowledge of in vivo biofilms, pathogen virulence, safety issues with non-standardized ALBC formulations, and questions about the cost-effectiveness of ALBC, there is a need to evaluate the evidence for this clinical practice. To this end, thought leaders in the field of musculoskeletal infection (MSKI) met on August 1, 2019 to review and debate published and anecdotal information, which highlighted four major concerns about current ALBC use: 1) substantial lack of Level 1 evidence to demonstrate efficacy; 2) ALBC formulations become subtherapeutic following early release, which risks induction of antibiotic resistance, and exacerbated infection from microbial colonization of the carrier; 3) the absence of standardized formulation protocols, and FDA-approved high-dose ALBC products to use following resection in MSKI treatment; and, 4) absence of a validated assay to determine the minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) to predict ALBC efficacy against patient specific microorganisms. Here we describe these concerns in detail, and propose areas in need of research. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract Aims Exposure to extraordinary traumatic experience is one acknowledged risk factor for drug use. We aim to analyse the influence of potentially life-changing childhood stressors, experienced second-hand, on later drug use disorder in a national population of Swedish adolescent and young adults (aged 15?26 years). Design We performed Cox proportional hazard regression analyses, complemented with co-relative pair comparisons. Setting Sweden. Participants All individuals in the Swedish population born 1984?95, who were registered in Sweden at the end of the calendar year that they turned 14 years of age. Our follow-up time (mean 6.2 years; range 11 years) started at the year they turned 15 and continued to December 2011 (n?=?1?409?218). Measurements Our outcome variable was drug use disorder, identified from medical, legal and pharmacy registry records. Childhood stressors, as per DSM-IV stressor criteria, include death of an immediate family member and second-hand experience of diagnoses of malignant cancer, serious accidental injury and victim of assault. Other covariates include parental divorce, familial psychological wellbeing and familial drug and alcohol use disorders. Findings After adjustment for all considered confounders, individuals exposed to childhood stressors ?parental death? or ?parental assault? had more than twice the risk of drug use disorder than those who were not [hazard ratio (HR)?=?2.63 (2.23?3.09) and 2.39 (2.06?2.79), respectively]. Conclusions Children aged under 15 years who experience second-hand an extraordinary traumatic event (such as a parent or sibling being assaulted, diagnosed with cancer or dying) appear to have approximately twice the risk of developing a drug use disorder than those who do not.

AB  - Abstract The functional significance of changes in nuclear structure and organization in transformed cells remains one of the most enigmatic questions in cancer biology. In this review, we discuss relationships between nuclear organization and transcription in terms of the three-dimensional arrangement of genes in the interphase cancer nucleus and the regulatory functions of nuclear matrix proteins. We also analyse the role of nuclear topology in the generation of gene fusions. We speculate that this type of multi-layered analysis will one day provide a framework for a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic origins of cancer and the identification of new therapeutic targets.

AB  - Abstract The Titicaca Basin of Peru and Bolivia has been occupied by humans for millennia and was home to one of the first major state societies in the Andes. Many foundations of state power, however, developed much earlier, during the Late Preceramic/Terminal Archaic Period (3000 ? 1500 BC), when people initially began herding, marking territories, and creating new metallurgy technology. We present a skeletal analysis of 14 individuals dating between 3000 and 1500 BC from Muruqullu, an archaeological site on the Copacabana Peninsula of Bolivia. These are the first Preceramic burials documented for the peninsula and contribute to the relatively small sample of Preceramic bodies from the Andean highlands more broadly. From this sample, we suggest that highland foragers and early herders suffered little nutritional stress and had limited violent interactions, perhaps related to a relatively mobile lifestyle and utilisation of lake resources.

AB  - Summary To address many real-life applications, ICs are necessary, but additional, basically mechanical features are also often necessary. All these features are usually provided by micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). Several types of MEMS are available from CMP, and these are classified into two categories. The first category consists of two bulk micromachining MEMS, one based on a standard CMOS process and the other on a standard BiCMOS process. The second category consists of the specific MEMS processes such as the Multi User MEMS Processes (MUMPs) and Sandia Ultra-planar Multi-level MEMS Technology V (SUMMiT V). In these processes, very advanced systems can be created on moveable platforms. Biomedical applications of electronics and MEMS in general include implant devices and biosensors, DNA-based systems, analytical protein arrays, and cell-based systems. This chapter addresses a few examples of what can be achieved with standard processes, for example, those available from CMP.

AB  - Summary Monitoring the effectiveness of treatment is an essential part of the overall management of horses affected by a wide variety of abdominal conditions. Careful monitoring of gastrointestinal function is important so that the response to therapy can be assessed, and any derangements or deteriorations of gastrointestinal function can be identified and supportive therapy instituted rapidly. However, the critically ill patient may develop abnormalities and dysfunction of many organ systems in addition to the system affected by the primary disease. The result can be multi-organ dysfunction, and ultimately multi-organ failure, which is invariably fatal. It is important, therefore, that monitoring allows assessment of the function of all of the major organ systems, and not just gastrointestinal function. This monitoring includes repeated physical examinations and pain assessment, monitoring of temperature and pulse and respiratory rates, and collection of clinical pathological data. Accurate medical records are essential to monitor trends in an animal's response to treatment.

AB  - Abstract The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1), contributes to neuronal inflammation and cell death induced by ischemia, excitotoxicity, or trauma, while administration of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) reduces neuronal injury. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that endogenous IL-1ra is neuroprotective in vivo and in vitro, and to identify its mechanism of actions. Mice lacking IL-1ra (IL-1ra knock-out (KO]) exhibited a dramatic increase in neuronal injury (3.6-fold increase in infarct size) induced by transient cerebral ischemia compared to wild-type (WT) animals. Basal cell death of cultured cortical neurons from WT and IL-1ra KO was identical, and treatment with NMDA or AMPA (20 ?M) increased cell death to the same extent in WT and IL-1ra KO neurons. However, basal and NMDA- or AMPA-induced cells death was significantly higher in glial?neuronal co-cultures from IL-1ra KO than from WT mice. We further showed that pure microglial cultures, but not pure astrocytes cultures, released IL-1ra in response to treatment with conditioned medium from NMDA- or AMPA-treated primary neurons. These results demonstrate that endogenous IL-1ra produced by microglia is neuroprotective in cerebral ischemia or excitotoxicity. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND The success of whole blood (WB) in damage control resuscitation on the battlefield has generated interest in its use for civilian trauma. Blood centers must maintain a committed donor pool with low isoagglutinin titers to provide this product. Information regarding isoagglutinin titers in different donor populations will help with targeted recruitment of these donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Sequential O D+ male donors with a history of two or more donations at a fixed site were tested for immunoglobulin (Ig)M anti-A and anti-B using a single titer cutoff of 256. Donors testing negative at this cutoff were considered ?low titer? while positive donors were considered ?high titer.? Age and self-identified race/ethnicity were retrospectively obtained from the blood establishment computer system. Fisher's exact analysis was used for statistical analysis with a p value of less than 0.05 considered significant. RESULTS Of 3274 donors, 426 tested as high titer, while 2848 tested as low titer. The data show an association of donor age and prevalence of high titers with older age groups showing a lower prevalence of high titers. In addition, different races/ethnicities have different prevalences of high titers with the Caucasian/white group showing a lower prevalence of high-titer donors versus the Hispanic and undeclared race groups. CONCLUSION The prevalence of high-titer IgM anti-A or -B donors varies by age group and race/ethnicity in our data set. This information will provide information on what donor groups to target for collection of low-titer O WB.

AB  - Summary Computed tomography (CT) is an excellent modality to depict and study the complex anatomy of the skull using multi-planar 2D images as well as 3D renderings. The foramina of the skull have been described on CT and magnetic resonance (MR) images. Congenital occipitoatlantoaxial malformations are rare in dogs; however, hypermotility or stenosis can cause severe neurologic compromise secondary to compression of the spinal cord. Atlantooccipital overlapping is rostral malposition of the atlas and axis resulting in compression of the cerebellum and kinking of the medulla oblongata. Benign calvarial hyperostosis has been described in young Bull Mastiffs as a diffuse thickening of the bones of the calvarium, with some similarities to craniomandibular osteopathy. Skull fractures due to trauma are best appreciated on CT images. CT features of osteomyelitis in the skull include soft tissue swelling, multifocal bone lysis with poorly defined cortical margins, regions of sclerosis, and irregular periosteal reaction.

AB  - Objective To develop questions for an owner-completed outcome assessment instrument for dogs with orthopedic disease. Study Design Focus groups, key-informant interviews, surveys. Sample Population Owners of dogs with osteoarthritis (OA). Methods Audio recorded focus groups were transcribed. Descriptive statistics around discussed topics were calculated. A list of frequently discussed behaviors underwent discrimination and frequency endorsement analysis and was circulated for refinement among veterinarians experienced in treating dogs with orthopedic disease. The final list of behaviors was transformed into a series of questions and organized as the preliminary instrument for testing in further studies. Results Owners (n?=?27) participated in 4 focus groups. Based on the frequency of comments generated during focus groups and key-informant interviews, 30 behaviors were further screened by discrimination analysis and endorsement frequency in an additional cohort of 60 owners. No behaviors were classified as ?good? for discriminating between front and hind limb disease so a single, non-limb-specific instrument was developed. Four behaviors had an endorsement frequency ≤33% and were not considered further for inclusion in the preliminary instrument. Twenty-one questions associated with the remaining behaviors were used to create the preliminary Canine Orthopedic Index (COI) for psychometric testing in further studies. Conclusions A 21-question owner-completed COI was successfully developed in preparation for psychometric testing studies.

AB  - Ultrasonography of a cat with diarrhoea and vomiting revealed a multi-layered, discrete linear structure within the large intestine with retention of the intestinal layers which could potentially be confused with an intestinal intussusception. The structure was ultimately expelled from the large intestine during defecation, and confirmed as a fibrinonecrotic cast. The origin of the fibrinonecrotic cast was assumed to be an intestinal pseudo-membrane formed in enteritis caused by immune suppression due to the panleukopenia virus. To our knowledge, this is the first ultrasonographic description of a fibrinonecrotic cast and spontaneous passage of the colonic cast in the veterinary field.

AB  - Abstract The success of implantation of materials into bone is governed by effective osseointegration, requiring biocompatibility of the material and the attachment and differentiation of osteoblastic cells. To enhance cellular function in response to the implant surface, micro- and nano-scale topography have been suggested as essential. In this study, we present bone implants based on 3D?printed titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V), with a unique dual topography composed of micron-sized spherical particles and vertically aligned titania nanotubes. The implants were prepared by combination of 3D?printing and anodization processes, which are scalable, simple and cost-effective. The osseointegration properties of fabricated implants, examined using human osteoblasts, showed enhanced adhesion of osteoblasts compared with titanium materials commonly used as orthopaedic implants. Gene expression studies at early (day 7) and late (day 21) stages of culture were consistent with the Ti substrates inducing an osteoblast phenotype conducive to effective osseointegration. These implants with the unique combination of micro- and nano-scale topography are proposed as the new generation of multi-functional bone implants, suitable for addressing many orthopaedic challenges, including implant rejection, poor osseointegration, inflammation, drug delivery and bone healing.

AB  - Abstract Aim: The objective of this study was to evaluate the aesthetics of implant-supported single crowns in the anterior maxilla using objective indices and patients' perception. Methods: Fifty participants, former patients (mean age 31.3 years) at the Dental Hospital, University of Bergen, or at Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen, Norway, who had implant-supported single crowns replacing upper anterior teeth lost due to trauma or agenesis during 2006, were included. One year after placement of the crown, an evaluation was carried out using the Pink Aesthetic Score (PES), the Implant Crown Aesthetics Index (ICAI), a modified version of the ICAI (mod-ICAI), and the index of the Californian Dental Association (CDA). The participants rated their satisfaction with the crowns and adjacent soft tissue. Results: The form of the crown was satisfactory for 88% and the colour for 84% of participants, while 72% were satisfied with the adjacent mucosa. A statistically significant bivariate correlation was found between the PES and the ICAI and mod-ICAI. A weaker association was found between the CDA and the ICAI, mod-ICAI and PES. A positive correlation was found between the mod-ICAI index and satisfaction with the form and colour of the crowns and with the sum of ratings of responses to the questions about the form and colour of the crowns and the form and colour of the adjacent mucosa (P<0.05). Although most participants were satisfied, objective evaluation showed that a good aesthetic outcome for single implants was related to the quantity of the peri-implant mucosa. Conclusion: The mod-ICAI index correlated with responses to questions about the form and colour of the mucosa. Other significant correlations were found between the participants' aesthetic perceptions and the ICAI and the mod-ICAI. The mod-ICAI combined best objective and subjective assessment of aesthetics related to implant-supported crowns. To cite this article: ?Vilhjálmsson VH, Klock KS, St?rksen K, Bårdsen A.

AB  - A general factor (gp) at the apex of personality has been suggested to account for the correlations between the Big Five. Although the gp has received ample support from monomethod studies, results from studies incorporating different methods have remained rather ambiguous; some have identified a gp across different informants, whereas others have not. It was hypothesized that these divergent findings are a result of varying lengths of acquaintance between raters. To this end, the current study presents a multitrait multi-informant meta-analysis (total N?=?11?941) that found weak support for a gp as a substantive trait of personality. Evidence for a gp was susceptible to the length of acquaintance between informants. Although a gp could be identified for short-term acquaintances, it remained elusive at long-term acquaintance. Thus, the gp in other ratings more likely reflects normative ratings of an average individual rather than ratings of the specific target person.

AB  - Objectives To describe the prevalence, clinical findings and predictors of disease in dogs with cervical hyperaesthesia. Materials and Methods Medical records of dogs referred for neurological investigation of cervical hyperaesthesia between 2009 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Dogs were assigned to one of the following groups according to the final diagnosis: Non-Neurologic, Brain, Cervical Spine, Multifocal, and Chiari-like Malformation/Syringomyelia. Demographic data, clinical and neurological signs and laboratory findings were compared between groups using univariate analysis; predictors of disease location were assessed by multivariate analysis. Results Final diagnostic allocations of the 185 records included in the study were as follows: 2.7% Non-Neurologic, 2.2% Brain, 63.2% Cervical Spine, 22.2% Multifocal and 9.7% Chiari Malformation/Syringomyelia. Intervertebral disc extrusion and steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis were the most common diseases. Compared to Multifocal dogs, those allocated a Cervical Spine diagnosis were older, heavier, more frequently ataxic and lame on a thoracic limb; furthermore, they were less frequently depressed or hyperthermic at presentation. Leucocytosis, neutrophilia and monocytosis were more frequent in dogs allocated a Multifocal diagnosis. Dogs with cervical hyperaesthesia older than 36?months and non-hyperthermic at presentation were more likely to have a lesion of the cervical region rather than a multi-focal disease. Clinical Significance Although non-specific, these results may be useful to guide clinicians in management of dogs presenting with cervical hyperaesthesia. Animal age and body temperature may support the suspicion of either focal or multi-focal cervical spinal disease.

AB  - Aim.? To understand the uniqueness of the experience of testing HIV positive from the perspective of pregnant women. Background.? As more people learn of their HIV diagnosis through routine screening processes, it is timely to reflect on the impact of receiving an unexpected positive result. Design.? A prospective qualitative study. Methods.? This paper draws on the case studies of four women who were participating in a larger prospective qualitative study of reproductive decision-making, pregnancy and childbirth following HIV diagnosis. Multiple interviews were conducted following diagnosis during pregnancy, and, after the birth of their babies. Thematic data analysis was undertaken. Results.? Drawing on Becker?s theory of disruption, we document the ?sudden disjuncture? of their antenatal diagnosis and the embodied emotional struggle the women engaged in to create continuity in their lives. A diagnosis of HIV disrupted the women?s biographies in terms of their health, relationships and social identity. As pregnant women, the threat of HIV was experienced most significantly in relation to their unborn child. However, their narratives also revealed how a diagnosis of HIV in the context of pregnancy, whilst traumatic, provided a focus for regaining continuity in their lives, as the baby became a metaphor for hope and orientation toward the future. Conclusions.? As HIV testing becomes more ?routine?, the findings of this study serve to remind health professionals that a positive diagnosis continues to constitute a major trauma to individuals and families. Relevance to clinical practice.? We propose that appropriately educated nursing and midwifery staff could facilitate the ?meaning making? process that is required for newly diagnosed HIV positive persons to find a subjective sense of well-being in their lives.
