AB  - Donation after circulatory death (DCD) liver transplantation (LT) reportedly yields inferior survival and increased complication rates compared with donation after brain death (DBD). We compare 100 consecutive DCD LT using a protocol that includes thrombolytic therapy (late DCD group) to an historical DCD group (early DCD group n = 38) and a cohort of DBD LT recipients (DBD group n = 435). Late DCD LT recipients had better 1- and 3-year graft survival rates than early DCD LT recipients (92% vs. 76.3%, p = 0.03 and 91.4% vs. 73.7%, p = 0.01). Late DCD graft survival rates were comparable to those of the DBD group (92% vs. 93.3%, p = 0.24 and 91.4% vs. 88.2%, p = 0.62). Re-transplantation occurred in 18.4% versus 1% for the early and late DCD groups, respectively (p = 0.001). Patient survival was similar in all three groups. Ischemic-type biliary lesions (ITBL) occurred in 5%, 3%, and 0.2% for early DCD, late DCD, and DBD groups, respectively, but unlike in the early DCD group, in the late DCD group ITBL was endoscopically managed and resolved in each case. Using a protocol that includes a thrombolytic therapy, DCD LT yielded patient and graft survival rates comparable to DBD LT.

AB  - Abstract The stability of orthopedic implants is governed by the interaction between the material's surface and bone cells. Nanosized structures seem to be promising in supporting the osseointegration of total joint replacements. In order to analyze whether nanostructured titanium surfaces, as generated by a short-pulsed Nd:YVO4 laser irradiation process developed in the aeronautics and space industry as a ?cold ablation? process, can be useful for orthopedic applications, their impact on bone cells is evaluated in vitro. Cell spreading and morphology on nanostructured titanium niobium nitride or titanium plasma-sprayed surfaces are comparable to osteoblast behavior on corresponding untreated titanium or cells grown on cover glass. However, on the nanostructured surfaces cell numbers appear to be reduced. Nonetheless, cell viability is not affected by laser pretreatment. Interestingly, osteoblast proliferation on nanostructured titanium is inhibited to the benefit of an increased production of osteoblast-specific proteins such as bone alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, or procollagen. Furthermore, an enhanced mineralization of cells grown on nanostructured surfaces is confirmed in terms of an elevated hydroxyapatite deposition. Laser irradiation leads to an additional nanostructure on microstructured titanium surfaces and might positively affect the biocompatibility and ingrowth of prostheses made from the corresponding biomaterials.

AB  - Background The aim of this study was to map pre-procedural variables for insertion of a central venous catheter, prophylactic blood component use and to investigate whether any independent variable could be identified as an independent risk factor for associated bleeding complications in patients outside the intensive care unit. Methods In this retrospective study, we investigated 1737 consecutive insertions of central venous catheters in 1444 patients in a large university hospital during 2009?2010. Pre-procedural coagulation status, blood component use, type of catheter, insertion site and complications during insertion were recorded and compared with bleeding complications documented on electronic charts. Results No serious bleeding complications were recorded in connection with the insertion of central venous catheters. Sixteen of 1769 (0.9%) insertions caused grade 2 bleeding, defined as bleeding requiring prolonged compression at the insertion site. Insertion of a large bore central dialysis catheter was found to be an independent risk factor for bleeding complications. Neither conventional coagulation tests nor accidental arterial puncture or the number of needle passes could predict bleeding complications in this study. Conclusion This retrospective study, in non-ICU patients, shows that serious bleeding complications in association with central line insertions are uncommon and that insertion of a large bore catheter is likely to be an independent risk factor for mild-bleeding complications in this population.

AB  - Abstract Crisis intervention services are now widely recognized as an efficacious treatment modality for the provision of emergency mental health care to individuals and groups. During the course of a lifetime, all people experience a variety of personal traumas, such as divorce or illness, while many others will also live through cataclysmic events, such as natural disasters or acts of violence, that result in a state of crisis. Although exposure to traumatic stressors can trigger adverse, long-term effects that can become extremely difficult to resolve without the timely delivery of effective, psychological intervention, crisis states can also provide an avenue for personal growth. This chapter presents a summary of the historical highlights and the theoretical influences on the development of modem crisis intervention theory. An overview of solution focused therapy, cognitive therapy, and other useful techniques are presented along with the differences and similarities in the delivery of emergency mental health services to individuals and groups. Case examples are used to illustrate the implementation of specific assessments and interventions in providing crisis intervention services. A general framework for collaborating with law enforcement and other agencies providing emergency care providers is presented. Cultural considerations in the context of a crisis, current research, and relevant legal issues are reviewed.

AB  - Abstract Objective:? To evaluate the effect of an educational intervention and documentary pro forma on the adequacy of documentation of intubation in an adult ED. Methods:? A structured medical record review was performed before and after a multi-pronged educational programme and introduction of a specifically designed guide to documentation. Records were assessed for adequacy of documentation by the presence or absence of predetermined elements. Analysis focused on five aspects considered to be most important for future clinical care: drugs and doses used, grade of view, size of endotracheal tube, confirmation of placement and adverse events/difficulties encountered. Results:? Sixty-one and sixty-eight charts were included in the pre-intervention and post-intervention groups, respectively. The drugs and doses used were documented in 92% and 93%. The endotracheal tube size was recorded 82% and 91% of the time. Grade of laryngoscopy was documented in 35% and 46%. Confirmation of endotracheal tube placement was 69% and 84%. Presence or absence of adverse events was recorded in 37% and 54%. All five elements were present in 8.2% and 25% of medical records. Conclusion:? Documentation improved slightly following the intervention, but was still unsatisfactory. We believe that to achieve an adequate level of documentation in the medical record for an episode of intubation, there needs to be a formal and structured mechanism, either via mandatory use of a specifically designed form and/or by participation in an organized data registry.

AB  - Currently, no well accepted and clearly defined ?core? curriculum for undergraduate anaesthesia teaching exists. To address this deficiency, we surveyed 73 university departments of anaesthesia and intensive care. Sixty-five replied from South-east Asia (12), Australasia (13), the UK and Ireland (28) and Canada (12). A questionnaire containing 37 items ranging from departmental structure to curriculum content was used. We found significant regional differences. Overall, most departments taught pharmacology of anaesthetic drugs (83%), pre-operative assessment (92%) and care of the unconscious patient (77%). Ninety-seven per cent taught airway management and intubation and 80% taught intravenous cannulation. Basic life support was taught by 92% and advanced life support by 71%. Fewer than half taught advanced trauma life support principles (44%). Critical care teaching was less well defined, but a consensus of schools taught respiratory failure and ventilation, management of circulatory shock and principles of sepsis and multi-organ system failure. Practical clinical skills were taught mainly using patients and simulators, 46% had a skills laboratory and six employed a resuscitation officer. However, it should be noted that we did not assess the quality and outcome of teaching.

AB  - Abstract Objective To quantify and describe alcohol-related presentations to our ED, as part of the binational Alcohol Harm in Emergency Departments study. Methods A prospective observational study at Royal Perth Hospital of every patient attending ED for the 168-h period commencing 08.00?hours Monday 1 December 2014. Patient presentations were classified as alcohol-related (alcohol-positive) using predefined criteria. These patients were compared to alcohol-negative patients on a range of demographic and clinical descriptors. Results Two hundred and thirteen (15.2%) of 1403 patients screened were alcohol-positive. Compared with alcohol-negative patients, alcohol-positive patients were more likely to be male (148/213, 69.5% vs 636/1190, 53.4%, P?<?0.001) and younger (mean 38 years vs 48 years, P?<?0.001). They were more likely to arrive in police custody (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.3?9.5, P?=?0.005), and be admitted to the State Adult Major Trauma Unit (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.1?8.3, P?<?0.001). Forty-two (19.7%) of 213 patients had injuries suspected to be caused by an alcohol-affected third party. The ED length of stay and admission rate were not significantly different between the groups. Conclusions 15.2% of patient presentations over the study week were alcohol-related. These patients were more likely to present with injury; one in five having injuries suspected to be caused by a third party affected by alcohol. This is a significant public health problem.

AB  - Purpose:?? Anastomotic leak (AL) from colorectal surgery is a common and potentially fatal complication that is currently diagnosed clinically with the aid of imaging studies. It has been hypothesized that portal sepsis occurs earlier than clinical signs of peritonism. The present study analysed liver function tests (LFTs) and white cell count (WCC) in patients with AL from colorectal procedures involving primary anastomosis, with the aim of identifying serum parameters that could provide an early indication of AL to allow timely surgical intervention. Materials and Methods:?? Between November 2003 and December 2008, 1243 consecutive colorectal procedures involving primary anastomosis from our institution were retrospectively screened for AL. LFTs and WCC of the identified patients were extracted from a central database for analysis. Results:?? From our database, we found thirty-four patients who required operative intervention and had confirmed AL according to their operation reports. Elevated levels of GGT above 115 and ALP above 55 were found in 71% and 61% of patients, respectively, prior to clinical anastomotic leakage. WCC appeared to remain on the upper border of the normal range in the majority of patients. Conclusion:?? Elevated median levels of GGT and ALP in this group of patients after the initial colorectal procedure is suggestive that LFTs may be a useful biomarker for anastomotic leaks. Further research in prospective trials should be performed to evaluate its usefulness.

AB  - ABSTRACT Bone fracture healing is sensitive to the fixation stability. However, it is unclear which phases of healing are mechano-sensitive and if mechanical stimulation is required throughout repair. In this study, a novel bone defect model, which isolates an experimental fracture from functional loading, was applied in sheep to investigate if stimulation limited to the early proliferative phase is sufficient for bone healing. An active fixator controlled motion in the fracture. Animals of the control group were unstimulated. In the physiological-like group, 1?mm axial compressive movements were applied between day 5 and 21, thereafter the movements were decreased in weekly increments and stopped after 6 weeks. In the early stimulatory group, the movements were stopped after 3 weeks. The experimental fractures were evaluated with mechanical and micro-computed tomography methods after 9 weeks healing. The callus strength of the stimulated fractures (physiological-like and early stimulatory) was greater than the unstimulated control group. The control group was characterized by minimal external callus formation and a lack of bone bridging at 9 weeks. In contrast, the stimulated groups exhibited advanced healing with solid bone formation across the defect. This was confirmed quantitatively by a lower bone volume in the control group compared to the stimulated groups.The novel experimental model permits the application of a well-defined load history to an experimental bone fracture. The poor healing observed in the control group is consistent with under-stimulation. This study has shown early mechanical stimulation only is sufficient for a timely healing outcome. ? 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This article reports on the investigation of the correlation between the European Addiction Severity Index (EuropASI) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) among 102 Norwegian drug abusers admitted to treatment. The aim of the study is to explore how different types and levels of childhood trauma and social and psychiatric factors, medical situation and experienced family history are interrelated. The study addresses three main questions: 1) What is the prevalence of different kinds of childhood trauma among drug abusers in treatment? 2) Does type or level of maltreatment in childhood predict specific substance abuse problems as adults and/or specific social, psychiatric and medical problems as adults? 3) Do substance abuse problems and mental health problems in the primary family predict different types and levels of childhood maltreatment? Twenty-five per cent of the total sample was included in the high-level trauma group and 54% in the intermediate-level group. Females had significantly higher scores than males in all types of childhood trauma. The strongest correlations were found between childhood trauma and lifetime psychiatric problems and psychiatric status during the last 30 days before admission for treatment. More research, and especially prospective studies, is needed to clarify the importance of parents' substance abuse and psychiatric problems in childhood/adolescent compared with trauma in the client's childhood and the client's current psychiatric status.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective.? To measure the impact of a structured opioid renewal program for chronic pain run by a nurse practitioner (NP) and clinical pharmacist in a primary care setting. Patients and Setting.? Patients with chronic noncancer pain managed with opioid therapy in a primary care clinic staffed by 19 providers serving 50,000 patients at an urban academic Veterans hospital. Design.? Naturalistic prospective outcome study. Intervention.? Based on published opioid prescribing guidelines and focus groups with primary care providers (PCPs), a structured program, the Opioid Renewal Clinic (ORC), was designed to support PCPs managing patients with chronic noncancer pain requiring opioids. After training in the use of opioid treatment agreements (OTAs) and random urine drug testing (UDT), PCPs worked with a pharmacist-run prescription management clinic supported by an onsite pain NP who was backed by a multi-specialty Pain Team. After 2?years, the program was evaluated for its impact on PCP practice and satisfaction, patient adherence, and pharmacy cost. Results.? A total of 335 patients were referred to the ORC. Of the 171 (51%) with documented aberrant behaviors, 77 (45%) adhered to the OTA and resolved their aberrant behaviors, 65 (38%) self-discharged, 22 (13%) were referred for addiction treatment, and seven (4%) with consistently negative UDT were weaned from opioids. The 164 (49%) who were referred for complexity including history of substance abuse or need for opioid rotation or titration, with no documented aberrant drug-related behaviors, continued to adhere to the OTA. Use of UDT and OTAs by PCPs increased. Significant pharmacy cost savings were demonstrated. Conclusion.? An NP/clinical pharmacist-run clinic, supported by a multi-specialty team, can successfully support a primary care practice in managing opioids in complex chronic pain patients.

AB  - Injuries sustained in violence are both physical and psychological. These two major effects are often investigated and treated in isolation. The study of assaultive injury, as opposed to victims in the criminal justice system, has given new perspectives on precise cause, the role of alcohol, comparative psychological impact of assault and accidents and how violence is reported, recorded and investigated in the criminal justice system. It has also produced a new injury severity scale and means of calculating compensation awards. Discoveries emanating from this research provide a compelling argument for an integrated multi-agency approach to adult violence, to optimise effectiveness of treatment, to bring hospitals into community crime prevention and to deal with the causes of injury. An integrated approach to research has led to the study of illness and injury experience prior to violence. In turn this has led to the realisation that antisocial behaviour probably gives rise to particular illnesses. DATES syndrome, which comprises drug abuse, assault, trauma and elective surgery, describes archetypal illness behaviour in the injured, but not necessarily in ?victims?. Further work is necessary to look for differing illness experience between offenders and the injured and to correlate offending, illness and injury with psychological, behavioural and developmental variables.

AB  - Abstract Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease, and the pathogenesis of RA is still unknown. Rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs) are of significance in the pathogenesis of RA. In this study, three microarray profiles (GSE55457, GSE55584, and GSE55235) of human joint FLSs from 33 RA patients and 20 normal controls were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus Dataset and analyzed to investigate the underlying pathogenesis of RA. As analyzed by the differently expressed genes, gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interaction network analysis, syndecan-4 (SDC4), a receptor of multiple cytokines and chemokines, which played a key role in the regulation of inflammatory response, was found to be an essential regulator in RA. To further validate these results, the levels of SDC4, reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), inflammation, and apoptosis in RA-FLSs were examined. SDC4-silenced RA-FLSs were also used. The results demonstrated that SDC4 and the level of ROS, NO, and inflammation were highly expressed while the apoptosis was decreased in RA-FLSs compared with normal FLSs. SDC4 silencing significantly suppressed the levels of ROS, NO, and inflammation; elevated the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; and promoted the apoptosis of RA-FLSs. Collectively, our results demonstrated a new mechanism of SDC4 in initiating the inflammation and inhibiting the apoptosis of RA-FLSs and that a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of RA in the clinic might be developed.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents an outline of the most thorough approach to psychiatric evaluation that is, the one most typically followed when someone is admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit. The complete psychiatric evaluation consists of the psychiatric interview; physical examination, including neurological assessment; laboratory testing; and, as appropriate, neuropsychological testing, structured interviews, and brain imaging. The results of the evaluation are then used to assess risk, reach tentative, and, if possible, definitive diagnoses, and complete initial and comprehensive treatment plans. The differential diagnosis is best approached by organizing the information obtained in the psychiatric evaluation into five domains of mental functioning according to the disturbances revealed by the evaluation. The most common referral after psychiatric evaluation is to psychotherapy and/or medication management.

AB  - Summary Veterinary technicians play an important role in preoperative planning by performing tests and providing the veterinary surgeon and anesthesia staff with the results. They also follow the veterinarian's orders by calculating medication dosage, filling prescriptions, and administering medications. Preoperative tests include complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry panel, and urinalysis. A database of a packed cell volume (PCV), total protein and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and blood glucose via a glucometer provides the minimal information required prior to surgery. In addition to the common blood and urine tests, a variety of conditions benefit from preoperative sampling. These include fine needle aspirates (FNA) of joints, abdomen, pulmonary spaces, masses, cysts, and abscesses for cytologic exam. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative imaging - radiographs, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast studies, and ultrasound - aid in diagnosis, surgical planning, and evaluation. Individual and combined modalities provide the surgeon and veterinary technician with specific information.

AB  - Abstract The bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) is a 456-residue cationic protein produced only by precursors of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and is stored in the primary granules of these cells. The potent (nM) cytotoxicity of BPI is limited to gram-negative bacteria (GNB), reflecting the high affinity (<10 nM) of BPI for bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The biological effects of isolated BPI are linked to complex formation with LPS. Binding of BPI to live bacteria via LPS causes immediate growth arrest. Actual killing coincides with later damage to the inner membrane. Complex formation of BPI with cell-asssociated or cell-free LPS inhibits all LPS-induced host cell responses. BPI-blocking antibodies abolish the potent activity of whole PMN lysates and inflammatory fluids against BPI-sensitive GNB. The antibacterial and the anti-endotoxin activities of BPI are fully expressed by the amino terminal half of the molecule. These properties of BPI have prompted preclinical and subsequent clinical testing of recombinant amino-terminal fragments of BPI. In animals, human BPI protein products protect against lethal injections of isolated LPS and inocula of GNB. Phase I trials in healthy human volunteers and multiple Phase I/II clinical trials have been completed or are in progress (severe pediatric meningococcemia, hemorrhagic trauma, partial hepatectomy, severe peritoneal infections, and cystic fibrosis) and two phase III trials (meningococcemia and hemorrhagic trauma) have been initiated. In none of >900 normal and severely ill individuals have issues of safety or immunogenicity been encountered. Preliminary evidence points to overall benefit in BPI-treated patients. These results suggest that BPI may have a place in the treatment of life-threatening infections and conditions associated with bacteremia and endotoxemia. J. Leukoc. Biol. 64: 14?18; 1998.

AB  - Objective: To describe the radiographic appearance of pulmonary oedema in cats with cardiac failure. Methods: Thoracic radiographs of 23 cats presented to a first opinion practice with signs of cardiac failure were reviewed. All cats had tachypnoea and/or dyspnoea and enlarged left atrium on echocardiography. Results: Pulmonary oedema was characterised radiographically by an increased opacity associated with a range of patterns and variable distribution. All cats had evidence of a reticular or granular interstitial pattern. This occurred in combination with alveolar pattern in 19 (83 per cent) cats, including six with air bronchograms, with increased diameter of pulmonary vessels in 16 (71 per cent) cats and with bronchial pattern in 14 (61 per cent) cats. The distribution of pulmonary oedema was considered to be diffuse/non-uniform in 14 (61 per cent) cats, diffuse/uniform in four (17 per cent) cats, multi-focal in four (17 per cent) cats and focal in the remaining one (4 per cent). Nine (39 per cent) cats were considered to have a regional distribution of oedema, including five (22 per cent) with a ventral distribution, three (13 per cent) with a caudal distribution and one (4 per cent) cat with a hilar distribution. The distribution of pulmonary opacities was bilaterally symmetrical in five (22 per cent) cats. Clinical Significance: The variable appearance of feline pulmonary oedema is likely to complicate its radiographic diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract This manuscript constitutes a review of several innovative biomedical technologies fabricated using the precision and accuracy of silicon micro- and nanofabrication. The technologies to be reviewed are subcutaneous nanochannel drug delivery implants for the continuous tunable zero-order release of therapeutics, multi-stage logic embedded vectors for the targeted systemic distribution of both therapeutic and imaging contrast agents, silicon and porous silicon nanowires for investigating cellular interactions and processes as well as for molecular and drug delivery applications, porous silicon (pSi) as inclusions into biocomposites for tissue engineering, especially as it applies to bone repair and regrowth, and porous silica chips for proteomic profiling. In the case of the biocomposites, the specifically designed pSi inclusions not only add to the structural robustness, but can also promote tissue and bone regrowth, fight infection, and reduce pain by releasing stimulating factors and other therapeutic agents stored within their porous network. The common material thread throughout all of these constructs, silicon and its associated dielectrics (silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, etc.), can be precisely and accurately machined using the same scalable micro- and nanofabrication protocols that are ubiquitous within the semiconductor industry. These techniques lend themselves to the high throughput production of exquisitely defined and monodispersed nanoscale features that should eliminate architectural randomness as a source of experimental variation thereby potentially leading to more rapid clinical translation.

AB  - Background In humanitarian settings, family-level drivers of mental health are insufficiently documented; we examined the strength of caregiver?child associations with two-wave, family-level Afghan data. Methods We recruited a gender-balanced sample of 681 caregiver?child dyads (n = 1,362 respondents) using stratified random-sampling in government schools in Kabul (364 dyads) and refugee schools in Peshawar (317 dyads). One year after baseline, we re-interviewed 64% of Kabul and 31% of Peshawar cohorts (n = 331 dyads, 662 respondents), retaining fewer Peshawar families due to refugee repatriation. In multivariable analyses adjusted for baseline, we assessed the extent to which caregiver mental health (Self-Report Questionnaire, SRQ-20) was associated with child symptom scores of post-traumatic stress (Child Revised Impact of Events Scale, CRIES), depression (Depression Self-Rating Scale, DSRS), psychiatric difficulties, impact, and prosocial strength (Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire, SDQ). Results Caregiver mental health was prospectively associated with all eight measures of child mental health at follow-up, adjusted for baseline. For post-traumatic stress, caregiver mental health had a predictive impact comparable to the child experiencing one or two lifetime trauma events. For depression, caregiver mental health approached the predictive impact of female gender. Thus a one SD change in caregiver SRQ-20 was associated with a 1.04 point change on CRIES and a 0.65 point change in DSRS. For multi-informant SDQ data, caregiver?child associations were strongest for caregiver ratings. For child-rated outcomes, associations were moderated by maternal literacy, a marker of family-level dynamics. Both adults and children identified domestic violence and quality of home life as independent risk and protective factors. Conclusions In the context of violence and displacement, efforts to improve child mental health require a thoughtful consideration of the mental health cascade across generations and the cluster of adversities that impact family wellbeing. We identify culturally meaningful leverage points for building family-level resilience, relevant to the prevention and intervention agenda in global mental health.
