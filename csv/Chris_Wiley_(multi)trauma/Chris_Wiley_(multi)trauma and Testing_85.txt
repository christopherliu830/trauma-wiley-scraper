AB  - Abstract Objective To report the results of the first randomized feasibility trial of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) plus Standard Care (SC) versus SC alone for DSM-5 posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults with intellectual disabilities. Method A total of 29 participants were randomized to either to EMDR + SC (n = 15) or SC (n = 14). Participants completed measures on traumatic stress (PCL-C) and comorbid distress at baseline, 1 week post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Results In the EMDR + SC group, 9 (60%) participants at post-treatment and 7 (47%) participants at 3-month follow-up were diagnosis free. In SC, 4 (27%) at post-treatment and follow-up were diagnosis free. At post-treatment, three participants (20%) dropped out from the EMDR + SC group, and 1 (7%) dropped out from the SC group. Conclusions It is feasible, acceptable and potentially effective to deliver EMDR in this population group.

AB  - Objectives To describe the development, preliminary validation and reliability testing of a shortened web-based form of GUVQuest, a structured questionnaire to measure health-related quality of life in dogs. Methods The original 109 items were reduced using expert judgement and factor analysis. Validity was established by factor analysis and in a subsequent field trial using a ?known groups? approach and classical test theory. Test?retest reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients. Results The instrument comprises 46 items each of which is rated by dog owners using a 7-point Likert scale. Factor analysis revealed a sensible structure containing four health-related quality of life domains (vitality, pain, distress and anxiety) accounting for 64·1% of the variability in the data. The field test involving 125 dogs demonstrated very good discriminative properties and intraclass correlation coefficient values of greater than 0·6. Clinical Significance This is the first report of a valid and reliable companion animal health-related quality of life instrument, the contemporary approach to animal welfare measurement, which is presented in a web-based format, with automated production of a health-related quality of life profile. It offers major advantages to dog owners, practitioners and researchers.

AB  - Key points Absence epilepsy is characterized by the occurrence of spike-and-wave discharges concomitant with an alteration of consciousness and is associated with cognitive comorbidities. In a genetic model of absence epilepsy in the rat, the genetic absence epilepsy rat from Strasbourg (GAERS), spike-and-wave discharges are shown to be initiated in the barrel field primary somatosensory cortex that codes whisker-related information, therefore playing an essential role in the interactions of rodents with their environment. Sensory-information processing is impaired in the epileptic barrel field primary somatosensory cortex of GAERS, with a delayed sensory-evoked potential and a duplicated neuronal response to whisker stimulation in in vivo extracellular recordings. Yet, GAERS present no defaults of performance in a texture discrimination task, suggesting the existence of a compensatory mechanism within the epileptic neuronal network. The results of the present study indicate that physiological primary functions are processed differently in an epileptic cortical network. Abstract Several neurodevelopmental pathologies are associated with disorganized cortical circuits that may alter primary functions such as sensory processes. In the present study, we investigated whether the function of a cortical area is altered in the seizure onset zone of absence epilepsy, a prototypical form of childhood genetic epilepsy associated with cognitive impairments. We first combined in vivo multichannel electrophysiological recordings and histology to precisely localize the seizure onset zone in the genetic absence epilepsy rat from Strasbourg (GAERS). We then investigated the functionality of this epileptic zone using extracellular silicon probe recordings of sensory-evoked local field potentials and multi-unit activity, as well as a behavioural test of texture discrimination. We show that seizures in this model are initiated in the barrel field part of the primary somatosensory cortex and are associated with high-frequency oscillations. In this cortex, we found an increased density of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in layer 5 in GAERS compared to non-epileptic Wistar rats. Its functional investigation revealed that sensory abilities of GAERS are not affected in a texture-discrimination task, whereas the intracortical processing of sensory-evoked information is delayed and duplicated. Altogether, these results suggest that absence seizures are associated with an increase of parvalbumin-inhibitory neurons, which may promote the functional relationship between epileptic oscillations and high-frequency activities. Our findings suggest that cortical circuits operate differently in the epileptic onset zone and may adapt to maintain their ability to process highly specialized information.

AB  - Objective To describe the frequency and extent of complications associated with lateral caudal axial pattern flaps used to cover large traumatic or excision skin defects on the dorsum, gluteal, and perineal region in 13 dogs. Study Design Case series. Animals Thirteen client-owned dogs. Methods Medical records from 8 institutions were reviewed for dogs treated with a lateral caudal axial pattern flap, including cases in which the procedure was combined with other reconstructive techniques. The flap length relative to the tail length, location of tail skin incision, size and cause of the defect, and short- and long-term complications were recorded. Results Thirteen dogs were included, 11 with tumors and 2 with traumatic skin loss. The mean estimated length of the flap relative to tail length was 51% (range 33?70%). Four dogs had wound complications. This included 2 dogs with minor postoperative wound complications (mild distal dehiscence) that did not require surgical revision and 2 dogs with major complications that required surgical revision. Two of these 4 dogs had distal flap necrosis, one was revised surgically and one was managed conservatively. In these 2 dogs, the flap length was estimated as 80% and 65% of the tail length, respectively. At 30 days, flaps in all dogs were completely healed. No long-term complications were recorded in any dog. For some dogs, the reconstruction was not obvious, with only the change in hair direction and color noticeable. Conclusion Lateral caudal axial pattern flap is a reconstructive option for gluteal, dorsal, and perineal skin defects in dogs. Distal flap necrosis and dehiscence due to wound infection occurred in 4 dogs that required additional wound care but not always surgical revision.

AB  - The inhibition of microbial growth is the first step toward avoiding the formation of biofilms. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the microbiostatic activity of cold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAP) with three commonly used antiseptic agents to find an alternative to or supplementary concept for antiseptic treatment. The efficacy of two CAP generating devices ? the plasma jet kINPen09? and a hollow dielectric barrier electrode (HDBD) ? both working with argon with or without admixture of 1% oxygen, was compared with chlorhexidine digluconate (CHG 0.0001 and 0.00000625%), polyhexanide (PHMB 0.0001 and 0.000025%) and octenidine dihydrochloride (OCT 0.0002 and 0.00005%). The antiseptics were added to the planktonic stage of the biofilm-forming strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa SG 81, Staphylococcus epidermidis RP 62A, Streptococcus mutans DSM 20523 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 resp. SC 5314. The antiseptics were present during the subsequent cultivation period (32.5?h), whereas CAP was applied for only 60?s with the same cultivation period after the exposition. During the cultivation period, growth was measured every hour by optical density and analyzed with the calculated area under the curve (AUC) to determine the delay of exponential growth. Except for the higher resistance of C. albicans against PHMB and S. mutans against CHG, P. aeruginosa was the most resistant test organism against the other antiseptic treatments. OCT 0.0002% was the most effective among the tested antiseptic agents. The plasma jet did not differ from OCT in its efficacy against C. albicans and S. mutans. Against P. aeruginosa and both Candida strains, the plasma jet was more effective than against both Gram-positive test strains. In terms of efficacy against Candida spp., the HDBD (dielectric barrier discharge plasma) did not differ significantly from the plasma jet with argon plasma; in contrast, the bacteriostatic efficacy was significantly higher. While the addition of 1% O2 did not change the efficacy of the plasma jet, the efficacy of the HDBD against S. epidermidis increased significantly. The antimicrobial efficacy of CAP as demonstrated in earlier studies was confirmed with planktonic microorganisms showing delayed growth during cultivation for 32.5?h after a single application of CAP for 60?s. Short treatment with CAP could be an effective alternative or supplement to conventional antiseptics, for example, to inhibit the growth of microorganisms in an infected wound. OCT in the concentration used here showed the best microbial growth inhibitory results among the antiseptics.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The objective was to study the variation in pediatric emergency department (PED) practice patterns for evaluation and management of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) and fever in U.S. children's hospitals. Methods A cross-sectional study of visits by children 3 months to 18 years of age with SCD and fever evaluated in 36 U.S. children's hospital PEDs within the 2010 Pediatric Health Information System database. The main outcome measures were the proportions of SCD visits that received evaluation (laboratory testing and chest radiographs [CXRs]) and treatment (parenteral administration of antibiotics) and were admitted for fever. Results Of the 4,853 PED visits for SCD and fever, 91.7% had complete blood counts (CBCs), 93.8% had reticulocyte counts, 93% had blood cultures obtained, 68.5% had CXRs, and 91.7% received antibiotics. Most (81.4%) patients received the recommended National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute evaluation (CBC, reticulocyte count, and blood culture) and treatment (parenteral antibiotics). In multivariate regression modeling controlling for hospital- and patient-level effects, age groups ≥1 to <5 years (odds ratio [OR] = 0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.25 to 0.40) and ≥5 to <13 years (OR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.32 to 0.50), and those visits that did not have CXRs had lower odds of hospital admission. After adjusting for age, payor status, receipt of laboratory testing, antibiotics, and CXRs, admission rates varied by sevenfold across U.S. children's hospitals (p < 0.001). Conclusions Standardization of practice exists across children's hospitals regarding obtaining laboratory studies and administering antibiotics for patients with SCD and fever. However, admission rates vary significantly. Evaluating the causes and consequences of such significant variation needs further exploration to improve the quality of care for patients with SCD.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents a case study of a 78-year-old woman who was brought to the emergency department (ED) by emergency medical service (EMS) with a chief complaint of a fall resulting in right wrist pain. The functional status of geriatric patients is dependent on multiple aspects of the individual patient, including things such as medical, physical, cognitive, and environmental issues. Functional decline as measured by various ADLs is an important factor in precipitating many ED visits as well, particularly those mobility related activities of daily living (ADLs). Direct observation of functional capabilities via performance testing of gait, gait speed, strength, and balance capabilities is the best method to assess such function, as both patients and physicians are poor predictors of functional limitations. Incorporating functional assessment into the multidisciplinary team approach such as that proposed by the new geriatric emergency department guidelines may help improve outcomes and prevent future adverse events.

AB  - A growing perception in endodontic circles is that root canal therapy requires one treatment visit only. One-visit endodontics offers many potential advantages. It is less time-consuming, resulting in less cost for the patient, potentially more profit for the dentist, less painful and less traumatic than multi-visit treatment. Conversely, if the pulp is necrotic and/or associated with periradicular disease, the root canal system is infected. In these cases, the root canal system should ideally be cleaned, an intracanal medication placed, and the canal filled at a second visit. In this paper we aim to review several aspects of one-visit versus multi-visit endodontic treatment and future perspectives in this field.

AB  - ABSTRACT To systematically review the characteristics, validity and outcome measures of tasks that have been described in the literature as assessing pattern separation and pattern completion in humans. Electronic databases were searched for articles. Parameters for task validity were obtained from two reviews that described optimal task design factors to evaluate pattern separation and pattern completion processes. These were that pattern separation should be tested during an encoding task using abstract, never-before-seen visual stimuli, and pattern completion during a retrieval task using partial cues; parametric alteration of the degree of interference of stimuli or degradation of cues should be used to generate a corresponding gradient in behavioral output; studies should explicitly identify the specific memory domain under investigation (sensory/perceptual, temporal, spatial, affect, response, or language) and account for the contribution of other potential attributes involved in performance of the task. A systematic, qualitative assessment of validity in relation to these parameters was performed, along with a review of general validity and task outcome measures. Sixty-two studies were included. The majority of studies investigated pattern separation and most tasks were performed on young, healthy adults. Pattern separation and pattern completion were most frequently tested during a retrieval task using familiar or recognizable visual stimuli and cues. Not all studies parametrically altered the degree of stimulus interference or cue degradation, or controlled for potential confounding factors. This review found evidence that some of the parameters for task validity have been followed in some human studies of pattern separation and pattern completion, but no study was judged to have adequately met all the parameters for task validity. The contribution of these parameters and other task design factors towards an optimal behavioral paradigm is discussed and recommendations for future research are made. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - One of the well-known enzymatic debriders is a papain?urea-chlorophyllin ointment. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of this ointment compared with single variable Papain-urea, Copper chlorophyllin, or Urea base ointment and moist wound care in porcine full thickness wounds. Twenty full thickness wounds were made on the dorsum of domestic pigs. Following hemostasis, the wounds were contaminated with wound-isolated bacteria, treated with test articles, and dressed with moisture-retentive dressing. All the wounds were evaluated 1, 4, 8, 11, 14, 18, and 21 days postsurgery visually and biopsies were obtained for microscopy. The results showed no impairment in the rate of epithelialization of the papain?urea-chlorophyllin treatment, nor with single variable actives compared with moist wound care. Microscopic examination revealed an increase in the number of keratinocytes present in the epidermis of the papain?urea-chlorophyllin and papain-treated wounds, and an increase in the depth of rete pegs. Blood vessel formation was increased in the papain?urea-chlorophyllin, papain, and Copper chlorophyllin groups compared to the moist control tissue as seen with CD31 and von Willebrand Factor staining, and was most evident in the papain?urea-chlorophyllin-treated tissues. VEGF was increased after 1 week in the wounds treated with papain?urea-chlorophyllin and papain compared to vehicle, indicating a possible mechanism for neovascularization. The increase was not seen in the Copper chlorophyllin group, indicating the possibility of another mechanism for blood vessel formation in this group. The healing appears to be most complete in the papain?urea-chlorophyllin group based on epidermal morphology and enhanced vascularization, which is vital in supplying nutrients to the newly healed wound.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aims To (1) describe the South African Community Epidemiology Network on Drug Use (SACENDU), (2) describe trends and associated consequences of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use in South Africa for January 1997 to December 1999 and (3) outline selected policy implications identified by SACENDU participants. Methods A descriptive epidemiological study of AOD indicators based on data gathered from multiple sources, including specialist treatment centres, trauma units and quantitative studies of target groups such as school students and arrestees. Networks were established in five sentinel sites to facilitate the collection, interpretation and dissemination of data. Results Over time alcohol has been the most frequently reported primary substance of abuse across sites. Trauma and psychiatric data highlight the burden associated with alcohol abuse. Cannabis and Mandrax (methaqualone), alone or in combination, are the most frequently reported illicit drugs of abuse, generally comprising the largest proportions of drug-related arrests, drug-related psychiatric diagnoses and drug-positive trauma patients. From 1997 to 1999, a significant increase in indicators for cocaine/crack and heroin occurred in two sites. Ecstasy (MDMA) use, alone or in combination with other substances, is reported among young people. Conclusions A broad range of globally abused substances is present in South Africa and the use and burden of illicit substances appears to be increasing. This points to the importance of ongoing monitoring of AOD trends. Through regular, systematic data collection the SACENDU project has made available more evidence-based information to direct AOD abuse policy and practice and has had an impact on research agendas.

AB  - Objective To investigate the effectiveness and safety of deracoxib (Deramaxx?) administered at a dose of 1?2 mg/kg/day for 3 days for control of postoperative pain and inflammation associated with soft tissue surgery in dogs. Study Design Prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical study. Animals Dogs (n = 34). Methods Dogs undergoing soft tissue surgeries were randomly assigned to receive either deracoxib (n = 18) or placebo (n = 16) as a preoperative treatment and again once daily for 2 additional days after surgery unless removed from the study. Dogs were evaluated before surgery and again postsurgically at predetermined times using the Glasgow Composite Pain Scale (GCPS). All dogs were allowed to receive another pain medication (except nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] or corticosteroids) as postsurgical pain intervention if the dog scored ≥6 on the GCPS or was in obvious discomfort. Dogs receiving pain intervention were considered treatment failures and were removed from the study. Results Two of 16 dogs treated with deracoxib were rescued compared with 9 of 16 dogs receiving placebo (P = .0091). In addition, deracoxib treated dogs had numerically lower GCPS scores. Conclusions Results suggest perioperative administration of deracoxib to dogs at 1?2 mg/kg/day for 3 days significantly improves analgesia in the postoperative surgical period after soft tissue surgery. Placebo dogs not rescued after painful procedures highlight the need for refinement of current pain assessment tools.

AB  - A mixed breed dog presented with diffuse unilateral hind limb swelling, which ultrasound and cytology confirmed to be caused by severe haematoma formation. Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography allowed distinct visualisation of an anomalous segment of the proximal popliteal artery, the presumed origin of the self-sustaining haematoma. Histopathology classified the malformed vessel as a haemangioendothelioma, a neoplasia of intermediate malignancy. Considering this as differential diagnosis to a neoplastic vascular alteration of high malignancy (such as haemangiosarcoma) might alter choice of treatment in future cases with similar clinical and imaging findings.

AB  - Objective: To determine response to treatment, survival and prognostic factors for feline extranodal lymphoma in the UK. Methods: Records of cats diagnosed with lymphoma of extranodal sites at seven referral centres were reviewed and information on signalment, tumour location, prior treatment and chemotherapy protocol recorded. Factors influencing response to treatment and survival were assessed. Results: One hundred and forty-nine cases met inclusion criteria. Sixty-nine cats had nasal lymphoma, 35 renal, 15 central nervous system, 11 laryngeal and 19 miscellaneous locations. Sixty-six cats received cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone, 25 Wisconsin-Madison doxorubicin-containing multi-agent protocol, 10 prednisolone alone and nine other combinations. The response rate for the 110 treated cats was 85·5 per cent. Of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone treated cats 72·7 per cent achieved complete remission, median survival 239 days. Sixty-four per cent of Wisconsin-Madison treated cats achieved complete remission, median survival 563 days. Cats with nasal lymphoma achieving complete remission had the longest survival (749 days) and cats with central nervous system lymphoma the shortest (70 days). If complete remission was achieved, prior treatment with corticosteroids significantly reduced survival time. Clinical Significance: Cats with extranodal lymphoma respond to chemotherapy and achieve survival times comparable to other locations. Corticosteroid pretreatment reduced survival time in cats achieving complete remission.

AB  - Abstract Objective? The aim of this paper was to analyse the results of treatment of anal fistulas retrospectively. Methods? Between 1992 and 2004, 407 patients were operated on for perianal fistula. In the follow-up period, 107 patients were lost, so 300 patients were analysed in the study. The mean follow-up time was 4.2?years. Analysed parameters included: types of surgical procedures in different kinds of fistulas and postoperative complications. Various types of surgical procedures and their effectiveness were described. Late results were assessed taking into account healing time, duration of sick leave, recurrence rate and incidence of anal sphincter dysfunction. Severity of gas and stool incontinence was assessed according to the Cleveland Clinic Incontinence Score. Results? In our study, subcutaneous fistula was diagnosed in 23.3%, inter-sphincteric in 18%, trans-sphincteric in 37.7%, supra-sphincteric in 16% and extra-sphincteric in 5% of patients. Single-tract fistulas were present in 88.7% and multi-tract fistulas were present in 11.3%. Overall, 242 patients had primary fistulas and 58 patients had recurrent fistulas. The most frequently performed procedures were cutting seton (139 patients) and radical fistulectomy (104 patients). Recurrent fistulas developed in 14.3%. Postoperative gas and/or stool incontinence was noticed in 10.7%. The recurrence rate was 5.4% in patients with primary fistula and in 51.7% patients presenting with a recurrent fistula. Gas and stool incontinence developed in 3.7% of patients with primary fistulas and in 39.7% of patients presenting with recurrent fistulas. Recurrence rate was 12% in the patients of single-tract fistulas and 32.4% in the patients of multi-tract fistulas. Postoperative gas and/or stool incontinence occurred in 8.3% of patients of single-tract fistulas and in 29.4% of patients of multi-tract fistulas. Conclusions? The complication rate was 10-fold higher in patients presenting with a recurrent fistula than in those with primary fistulas and threefold higher in patients with multi-tract fistulas than in those with single-tract fistulas.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Identifying older emergency department (ED) patients with clinical features associated with adverse postdischarge outcomes may lead to improved clinical reasoning and better targeting for preventative interventions. Previous studies have used single-country samples to identify limited sets of determinants for a limited number of proxy outcomes. The objective of this study was to identify and compare geriatric syndromes that influence the probability of postdischarge outcomes among older ED patients from a multinational context. Methods A multinational prospective cohort study of ED patients aged 75 years or older was conducted. A total of 13 ED sites from Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Iceland, India, and Sweden participated. Patients who were expected to die within 24 hours or did not speak the native language were excluded. Of the 2,475 patients approached for inclusion, 2,282 (92.2%) were enrolled. Patients were assessed at ED admission with the interRAI ED Contact Assessment, a geriatric ED assessment. Outcomes were examined for patients admitted to a hospital ward (62.9%, n = 1,436) or discharged to a community setting (34.0%, n = 775) after an ED visit. Overall, 3% of patients were lost to follow-up. Hospital length of stay (LOS) and discharge to higher level of care was recorded for patients admitted to a hospital ward. Any ED or hospital use within 28 days of discharge was recorded for patients discharged to a community setting. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were used to describe determinants using standard and multilevel logistic regression. Results A multi-country model including living alone (OR = 1.78, p ≤ 0.01), informal caregiver distress (OR = 1.69, p = 0.02), deficits in ambulation (OR = 1.94, p ≤ 0.01), poor self-report (OR = 1.84, p ≤ 0.01), and traumatic injury (OR = 2.18, p ≤ 0.01) best described older patients at risk of longer hospital lengths of stay. A model including recent ED visits (OR = 2.10, p ≤ 0.01), baseline functional impairment (OR = 1.68, p ≤ 0.01), and anhedonia (OR = 1.73, p ≤ 0.01) best described older patients at risk of proximate repeat hospital use. A sufficiently accurate and generalizable model to describe the risk of discharge to higher levels of care among admitted patients was not achieved. Conclusions Despite markedly different health care systems, the probability of long hospital lengths of stay and repeat hospital use among older ED patients is detectable at the multinational level with moderate accuracy. This study demonstrates the potential utility of incorporating common geriatric clinical features in routine clinical examination and disposition planning for older patients in EDs.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between the psychoanalytic concept of object relations and real life behavior of being in an intimate relationship among heterosexual women. In a multi-method approach we used two different measures; the self-report Bell Object Relations and Reality Testing Inventory (BORRTI; Bell, Billington & Becker, ) and the performance based Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) Social Cognition & Object Relations Scale- Global Rating Method SCORS-G (Westen, ) to measure the object relations of 60 women. The Alienation subscale of the BORRTI and understanding of social causality subscale of the SCORS-G explained 34.8% of variance of the intimate relationship variable. Thus, women involved in a romantic relationship reported lower rates of alienation on the BORRTI and produced TAT narratives that were more adaptive with regard to understanding of social causality as measured by the SCORS-G than those not currently in a relationship. Results are discussed with reference to the relationship between object relations and real life measures of healthy individuals and in light of the need for a multi-method approach of assessment.

AB  - This report describes the first clinical case, in Europe, of a high-level gentamicin-resistant and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infection in a dog. The aim of this report is to alert the veterinary profession to high-level gentamicin-resistant and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in companion animal patients. Multi-drug resistant strains of this pathogen are the cause of considerable problems in human hospitals and for community healthcare professionals worldwide. The potential for a similar impact within veterinary medicine is discussed.
