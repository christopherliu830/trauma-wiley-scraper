AB  - Abstract Objective Investigations examining psychosocial adjustment among childhood cancer survivors have focused primarily on negative effects and psychopathology. Emergent literature suggests the existence of positive impact or adjustment experienced after cancer, as well. The purpose of this study is to examine the distribution of Perceived Positive Impact (PPI) and its correlates in young adult survivors of childhood cancer. Methods 6425 survivors and 360 siblings completed a comprehensive health survey, inclusive of a modified version of the Post-traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) as a measure of PPI. Linear regression models were used to examine demographic, disease and treatment characteristics associated with PPI. Results Survivors were significantly more likely than siblings to report PPI. Endorsement of PPI was significantly greater among female and non-white survivors, and among survivors exposed to at least one intense therapy, a second malignancy or cancer recurrence. Survivors diagnosed at older ages and fewer years since diagnosis were more likely to report PPI. Income, education and marital/relationship status appeared to have varied relationships to PPI depending upon the subscale being evaluated. Conclusions The existence and variability of PPI in survivors in this study suggest that individual characteristics, inclusive of race, gender, cancer type, intensity of treatment, age at diagnosis and time since diagnosis, have unique and specific associations with different aspects of perceived positive outcomes of childhood cancer.

AB  - Summary According to transplant registries, grafts from elderly donors have lower survival rates. During 1999?2005, we evaluated the outcomes of 89 patients who received a liver from a donor aged ≥?60?years and managed with the low liver-damage strategy (LLDS), based on the preoperative donor liver biopsy and the shortest possible ischemia time (group D?≥?60-LLDS). Group D ≥?60-LLDS was compared with 198 matched recipients, whose grafts were not managed with this strategy (89 donors?<?60?years, group D?<?60-no-LLDS and 89 donors aged ≥60?years, group D?≥?60-no-LLDS). In the donors proposed from the age group of ≥60?years, the number of donors rejected decreased during the study period and the LLDS was found to be responsible for this in a significant manner (47% vs. 60%, respectively P?<?0.01). Among the recipients transplanted, the clinical features (age, gender, viral infection, child and model for end-stage liver disease score) were comparable among groups, but group D ≥?60-LLDS had a lower mean ischemia time: 415?±?106?min vs. 465?±?111 (D?<?60-no-LLDS), P?<?0.05 and vs. 476?±?94 (D?≥?60-no-LLDS), P?<?0.05. After a median follow-up of 3?years, the 1- and 3-year graft survival rates of group D ≥?60-LLDS (84% and 76%) were comparable with group D <?60-no-LLDS (89% and 76%) and were significantly higher than group D ≥?60-no-LLDS (71% and 54%), P?<?0.005. In conclusion, the LLDS optimized the use of livers from elderly donors.

AB  - Reading standards are regarded by many as the true yardstick by which to measure school effectiveness, and the relative standards achieved by different generations are often debated by adults. Some young people do not perceive reading to be of anything like such importance, however, using digital communication habitually and easily. Each year a growing number of young people enter secondary education without having achieved functional reading. Illiteracy in Year 7 poses a real problem for the secondary SEN teacher. Financial and timetable constraints make it impossible to arrange individual multi-sensory teaching. A programme of didactic teaching using selections from several different approaches to reading was delivered to a group of ten semi-literate and illiterate young people throughout the 2010?2011 academic year.

AB  - Background:?? With the use of the three-point lap-diagonal seat belt restraint there has been a reduction in the number of deaths caused by automobile trauma. However, with the use of a restraint, a new pattern of injuries has emerged. The ?seat-belt syndrome? comprises a constellation of injuries including soft tissue injury to the breast. Given that seat-belt legislation is becoming more widespread, it is likely that the incidence and reporting of these injuries will become more common. In this paper, we provide an overview of the reported literature regarding three-point lap-diagonal seat belt injury to the female breast. We then discuss the previously unreported area of breast reconstruction in a breast deformed as a result of blunt trauma, using a specific case as an example. Methods:?? A Medline search was undertaken and all available reported literature, related to seat-belt associated breast trauma, reviewed. Results:?? A concise summary of the varied clinical and radiological presentations is given, as is their suggested management. Subsequently highlighted is the paucity of literature discussing the breast reconstruction options for a breast deformed by blunt trauma and thus, this issue is discussed using a specific case as an example. Conclusions:?? Blunt breast trauma secondary to seat-belt restraint is not only likely to become more common, but can be severe in its functional, psycho-social and aesthetic impact. This paper provides a new adjunct to the currently reported literature, especially in the area of plastic surgical reconstruction of a breast deformed by blunt trauma.

AB  - Abstract Simulation technology has successfully improved patient safety and care quality through training and assessment of individuals, teams, and health care systems. Emergency medicine (EM) continues to be a leader and pioneer of simulation, including administration of simulation-based fellowships and training programs. However, EM simulation?based research has been limited by low rates of publication and poor methodologic rigor. The Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) Simulation Academy is leading efforts to improve the quality of scholarship generated by the EM simulation community and to foster successful research careers for future generations of EM simulationists. Through a needs assessment survey of our membership and a year-long consensus-based approach, we identified two main clusters of barriers to simulation-based research: lack of protected time and dedicated resources and limited training and mentorship. As a result, we generated four position statements with implications for education, training, and research in EM simulation and as a call to action for the academic EM community. Recommendations include expansion of funding opportunities for simulation-based research, creation of multi-institutional simulation collaboratives, and development of mentorship and training pathways that promote rigor in design and methodology within EM simulation scholarship.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the bi-planar robot navigation system for insertion of cannulated screws in femoral neck fractures. Method Between January 2016 and December 2016, 60 patients with femoral neck fractures were separately treated using percutaneous cannulated screws assisted by the bi-planar robot navigation system (robot group) and conventional freehand surgery (freehand group). The fluoroscopy time, the number of drilling attempts, and the operation time were recorded during operations; the dispersion and parallelism of the cannulated screws on the posteroanterior and lateral images were measured after operations. Patients were followed up for 12?24?months and the Harris scores and the final results of the two groups were compared. Results During bi-planar robot navigation system-assisted surgery, the fluoroscopy time for acquisition of images was 2.3?seconds on average, and the time for planning screws during the operation was 2.8?min on average. The average fluoroscopy time during the placement of the guide pin was 5.7?seconds and 14.14?seconds (P?=?0.00), respectively. The average time of the placement of the cannulated screws was 12.7?min and 19.4?min (P?=?0.00), respectively, in the robot group and the freehand group. In the robot group, only one guide pin was replaced during the operation, and the average number of adjustments for each guide pin was 2.39 in the freehand group. The screw parallelism and dispersion measured by postoperative imaging in the robot group were significantly superior to those in the freehand group. From postoperative CT it was evident that there were 5 cases of screws exiting the posterior cortex in both groups. During the follow-up phase, 1 case of femoral head necrosis and 5 cases of femoral neck shortening of more than 10 mm occurred in the robotic navigation group; 3 cases of femoral head necrosis, 1 case of fracture nonunion, and 2 cases of shortening of more than 10?mm occurred in the freehand group. At 18?months after surgery, the average Harris scores of the patients were 85.20 and 83.45, respectively, with no significant difference. Conclusion Using bi-planar robot navigation system-assisted placement of femoral neck cannulated screws can significantly reduce the time of intraoperative fluoroscopy, drilling attempts, and operation time. The placed screws are superior to the screws placed freehand in relation to parallelism and dispersion. However, it is still necessary for surgeons to have a good reduction of the femoral neck fracture before surgery and to be proficient in the operation of the robot navigation system. In summary, the bi-planar robot navigation system is an effective assistant instrument for surgery.

Materials and Methods Medical records of dogs diagnosed with leptospirosis from 2006 to 2013 were evaluated retrospectively. Results The study included 99 dogs. At initial presentation, the most common clinical signs were lethargy (96%), anorexia (88%), vomiting (85%), painful abdomen (39%), diarrhoea (38%), oliguria (27%) and tachypnoea (26%). Abnormal laboratory findings included anaemia (63%), thrombocytopenia (63%), leucocytosis (57%), increase of plasma urea (84%) and creatinine concentrations (81%), increased liver enzyme activities (80%), hyperbilirubinaemia (69%), hyperphosphataemia (67%), hyponatraemia (64%), hypoalbuminaemia (55%) and hypokalaemia (29%). Radiological pulmonary changes were detected in 57% of the dogs initially or during the course of disease. Severe dyspnoea, oliguria, azotaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia and severe radiological pulmonary changes were more often found in dogs that did not survive. There was renal, hepatic and pulmonary involvement in 95, 92 and 58% of the dogs, respectively, and multi-organ lesions in 98 dogs (98%); 32 dogs died or were euthanased. Conclusion Several clinical and laboratory abnormalities were associated with a negative outcome; severe lung involvement was specifically associated with high mortality.

AB  - Abstract: The authors have retrospectively evaluated the clinical results of mandibular incisors replacement with narrow neck implants (NNI). Thirty-one patients treated consecutively for single or multiple lower incisor replacement with NNI with a mean follow-up of 23 months (range 18?42 months) were included in the study and were divided into three groups: single tooth, multiple unit restoration and restorations on adjacent implants. Survival and success rates and soft tissue parameters such as modified plaque index (mPI), peri-implant probing depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BOP) and the papilla index were analyzed. Subjective evaluation was performed by patients and clinicians on visual analogue scales. The implants and prostheses showed a survival rate of 100% and an overall success rate of 94%. The distribution of mPI outcomes showed better results for the single tooth group. BOP was present in four of eight implants (50%) in the adjacent implant group, in one out of 20 implants in the single tooth group (5%) and in one out of 16 implants in the multi unit group (6%). The adjacent implant group showed a statistically significant increase in PPD. The Papilla Index showed a better outcome distribution in single tooth and multi unit groups. Patients' evaluation of treatment outcome was satisfactory in all groups, even though the best esthetic and functional results were found in single tooth and multi unit groups. The professional evaluation showed good outcomes for the single tooth and multi unit groups and statistically significant poorer results in the adjacent implants group. With the limitations of this study, it may be concluded that the replacement of lower incisors with NNI leads to favorable functional and esthetic results in cases of single-tooth or multiple-unit replacement. Worse results are achieved if two adjacent mandibular incisors are replaced with adjacent implants.

AB  - Abstract Aim Accurate prediction of which high-risk individuals will go on to develop psychosis would assist early intervention and prevention paradigms. We sought to review investigations of prospective psychosis prediction based on markers and variables examined in longitudinal familial high-risk (FHR) studies. Methods We performed literature searches in MedLine, PubMed and PsycINFO for articles assessing performance characteristics of predictive clinical tests in FHR studies of psychosis. Studies were included if they reported on one or more predictive variables in subjects at FHR for psychosis. We complemented this search strategy with references drawn from articles, reviews, book chapters and monographs. Results Across generations of FHR projects, predictive studies have investigated behavioural, cognitive, psychometric, clinical, neuroimaging and other markers. Recent analyses have incorporated multivariate and multi-domain approaches to risk ascertainment, with generally modest results. Conclusions Although a broad range of risk factors has been identified, no individual marker or combination of markers can at this time enable accurate prospective prediction of emerging psychosis for individuals at FHR. We outline the complex and multi-level nature of psychotic illness, the myriad of factors influencing its development, and methodological hurdles to accurate and reliable prediction. Prospects and challenges for future generations of FHR studies are discussed in the context of early detection and intervention strategies.

AB  - Abstract Urban residents experience a wide range of traumatic events and are at increased risk of assaultive violence. Although previous research has examined trajectories of posttraumatic stress (PTS) through latent class growth analysis (LCGA) among persons exposed to the same index events (e.g., a natural disaster), PTS trajectories have not been documented among urban residents. The aims of this study were to conduct LGCA with a sample of trauma survivors from Detroit, Michigan (N = 981), and to explore predictors of trajectory membership. Participants completed three annual telephone surveys, each of which included the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Checklist-Civilian Version. Four PTS trajectories were detected. Although the majority evidenced a trajectory of consistently few symptoms (Low: 72.5 %), 4.6 % were in a trajectory of chronic severe PTSD (High), and the remainder were in trajectories of consistently elevated, but generally subclinical, levels of PTS (Decreasing: 12.3 %; Increasing: 10.6 %). Socioeconomic disadvantage (e.g., lower income), more extensive trauma history (e.g., childhood abuse), and fewer social resources (e.g., lower social support) were associated with membership in higher PTS trajectories, relative to the Low trajectory. The results suggest that efforts to reduce PTS in urban areas need to attend to socioeconomic vulnerabilities in addition to trauma history and risk for ongoing trauma exposure.

AB  - Abstract To enable dynamic regulation of muscle mass and myofiber repair following injury, a satellite cell precursor population exists to supply additional nuclei. Activated satellite cells express many genes and associated proteins necessary for maturation and incorporation into the damaged fiber. There is little knowledge about the response of these markers following whole-body resistance exercise training. We investigated the impact of 12 weeks of progressive whole-body resistance training on the expression of MRFs, PAX7, NCAM, and FA1, incorporating both acute and chronic resistance exercise components. Ten young recreationally active males (21.2 ± 3.5 years) performed 12 weeks of whole-body resistance training at 70?85% of their predetermined one-repetition maximum (1RM). At the initiation and completion of the training period, muscular strength was assessed by RM and dynamometer testing, and vastus lateralis samples were obtained prior to and 3 h following an acute resistance exercise test (both whole-body and isometric exercises). Increased mRNA expression of PAX7 (threefold), NCAM (threefold), MYF5 (threefold), MYOD (threefold) and MYOGENIN (twofold) was observed 3 h after the acute resistance exercise test, both pre and posttraining. Similarly, PAX7 (11-fold) and FA1 (twofold) protein abundance increased after acute exercise, while resting NCAM (eightfold) and FA1 (threefold) protein abundance increased following 12 weeks of resistance training. It is possible that these molecular changes are primarily due to the preceding exercise bout, and are not modified by long-term or whole-body exercise training.

AB  - Abstract Background and objective Acinetobacter baumannii and A. baumannii/calcoaceticus complex are commonly encountered pathogens in nosocomial infections. This study aimed to evaluate the treatment and prognostic risk factors in nosocomial pneumonia caused by these microorganisms. Methods The study was conducted retrospectively in Uludag University Hospital and included 356 adult non-neutropenic patients with nosocomial pneumonia. Results Of the subjects, 94.9% (n?=?338) had ventilator-associated pneumonia. The clinical response rate was 57.2%, the 14-day mortality 39.6% and the 30-day mortality 53.1%. The significant independent risk factors for the 30-day mortality were severe sepsis (OR, 2.60; 95% CI: 1.49?4.56; P?=?0.001), septic shock (OR, 6.12; 95% CI: 2.75?13.64; P?<?0.001), APACHE II score?≥?20 (OR, 2.12; 95% CI: 1.28?3.50; P?=?0.003) and empiric monotherapy (OR, 1.63; 95% CI: 1.00?2.64; P?=?0.048). Multi-trauma (OR, 2.50; 95% CI: 1.11?5.68; P?=?0.028) was found to be a protective factor. In patients with a clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS)?>?6 on the third day of treatment, both the 14- and 30-day mortality rates were high (P?<?0.001, P?<?0.001). Also, the 14- and 30-day mortality rates were significantly higher in the patients treated with empiric monotherapy compared with combination therapy (48/93 (51.6%)?46/123 (37.4%), P?=?0.037 and 62/93 (66.7%)?65/123 (52.8%), P?=?0.041, respectively) in pneumonia caused by imipenem-resistant strains. Conclusion Mortality rates were high in pneumonia caused by imipenem-resistant A. baumannii or A. baumannii/calcoaceticus complex. In the units with a high level of carbapenem resistance, antibiotic combinations should be considered for empiric therapy.

AB  - Abstract Current immunosuppression in VCA is largely based on the experience in solid organ transplantation. It remains unclear if steroids can be reduced safely in VCA recipients. We report on five VCA recipients who were weaned off maintenance steroids after a median of 2 months (mean: 4.8 months, range 2?12 months). Patients were kept subsequently on a low dose, dual maintenance consisting of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil/mycophenloic acid with a mean follow-up of 43.6 months (median?=?40 months, range 34?64 months). Early and late acute rejections responded well to temporarily augmented maintenance, topical immunosuppression, and/or steroid bolus treatment. One late steroid-resistant acute rejection required treatment with thymoglobulin. All patients have been gradually weaned off steroids subsequent to the treatment of acute rejections. Low levels of tacrolimus (<5?ng/mL) appeared as a risk for acute rejections. Although further experience and a cautious approach are warranted, dual-steroid free maintenance immunosuppression appears feasible in a series of five VCA recipients.

AB  - Abstract Aim: This series of case reports evaluated the impact of adhesive crown?root fragment reattachment in periodontally healthy teeth suffering from crown?root fractures on various parameters of periodontal health over a time course of 2 years. Material and Methods: A total of 20 teeth with crown?root fractures in 18 periodontally healthy subjects were evaluated. After open-flap access, crown?root fragments were adhesively reattached to the root stub. In all cases, the vertical difference between the alveolar bone crest and the fracture line was 1?mm, i.e. violating the biological width. Subsequently, clinical attachment level (CAL), probing pocket depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BoP) and gingival index (GI) scores were recorded at 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively for the restored teeth as well as plaque index (PlI) and periodontal screening index (PSI) values for the whole dentition. Results: Two years after therapy, recorded CAL, PPD, BoP, GI, PlI and PSI scores revealed healthy periodontal conditions in 18 out of 20 treated teeth. Two teeth had suffered again from fragment fracture due to new traumata. Conclusions: Adhesive fragment reattachment in periodontally healthy teeth affected by crown?root fractures had no detrimental impact on periodontal health over a time course of 2 years.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Pruritus is the most common presenting sign in feline dermatology. Pruritus can be a perplexing sign in feline dermatology due to the number of presentations which may be seen and to the frequent lack of correlation between the pattern of pruritus and the underlying problem. In this series of articles, the presentation, diagnostic approach and aetiological classification of pruritic skin disease in the cat will be discussed, allowing the clinician to formulate a rational approach to the pruritic cat.

AB  - Abstract While current injury criteria for the automotive industry are based on bone fracture, the majority of knee injuries suffered in collisions each year do not involve fracture of bone. Instead, clinical studies of traumatic joint injury often document early pain and development of chronic diseases, such as osteoarthritis. Previous studies suggest chronic disease can be initiated by cell death that occurs in articular cartilage during mechanical trauma to the joint. In the current investigation early necrosis of chondrocytes was investigated after blunt trauma to chondral explants. A non-ionic surfactant (P188) was explored as a potential tool for early intervention into the disease process, as this surfactant has been shown to repair damaged membranes in other cell lines. Three groups of adult bovine chondral explants were equilibrated for 48 h in culture media. Two groups were then loaded to 25 MPa in unconfined compression. Half the specimens in each group were incubated in media supplemented with 8 mg/ml P188 immediately after loading, while the other half was returned to standard media. At 1 and 24 h the percentages of live and dead cells in compressed and control groups were determined with a cell viability stain. At 1 h post-trauma, P188 incubated specimens had a significantly increased percentage of live cells in the superficial zone versus the no-P188 group. At 24 h the percentages of live cells in all three zones of the P188-treated explants were significantly greater than in the no treatment group. This study showed that P188 surfactant could help restore the integrity of cell membranes in cartilage damaged by blunt mechanical trauma. With the ability of P188 to ?save? chondrocytes from early necrotic death using in vitro chondral explants, its role in prevention of a post-traumatic osteo-arthritis in a diarthrodial joint should be further explored using in vivo animal models. ? 2004 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Aim To determine if differences exist between paediatric intensive care nurses and allied health professionals in empathy, secondary trauma, burnout, pain exposure and pain ratings of self and others. Early and late career differences were also examined. Background Nurses are routinely exposed to patient pain expression. This work context may make them vulnerable to adverse outcomes such as desensitization to patient pain or a compromise in personal well-being. Design Cross-sectional study. Methods Data were collected from a convenience sample of paediatric intensive care nurses (n = 27) and allied health professionals (n = 24), from September 2014?June 2015, at a Canadian health centre. Both groups completed one demographic and three behavioural scales. Participants underwent fMRI while rating the pain of infant and adult patients in a series of video clips. Data were analyzed using parametric and non-parametric methods. fMRI results are reported in a second paper. Results Nurses were significantly more likely to be exposed to pain at work than allied health professionals and scored significantly higher on dimensions of empathy, secondary trauma and burnout. Nurses scored their own pain and the pain of infant and adult patients, higher than allied health participants. Less experienced nurses had higher secondary trauma and burnout scores than more experienced nurses. Conclusions Paediatric intensive care work demands, such as patient pain exposure, may be associated with nurse's higher report of empathy and pain in self and others, but also with higher levels of secondary trauma and burnout, when compared with allied health professionals.
