AB  - Abstract While current injury criteria for the automotive industry are based on bone fracture, the majority of knee injuries suffered in collisions each year do not involve fracture of bone. Instead, clinical studies of traumatic joint injury often document early pain and development of chronic diseases, such as osteoarthritis. Previous studies suggest chronic disease can be initiated by cell death that occurs in articular cartilage during mechanical trauma to the joint. In the current investigation early necrosis of chondrocytes was investigated after blunt trauma to chondral explants. A non-ionic surfactant (P188) was explored as a potential tool for early intervention into the disease process, as this surfactant has been shown to repair damaged membranes in other cell lines. Three groups of adult bovine chondral explants were equilibrated for 48 h in culture media. Two groups were then loaded to 25 MPa in unconfined compression. Half the specimens in each group were incubated in media supplemented with 8 mg/ml P188 immediately after loading, while the other half was returned to standard media. At 1 and 24 h the percentages of live and dead cells in compressed and control groups were determined with a cell viability stain. At 1 h post-trauma, P188 incubated specimens had a significantly increased percentage of live cells in the superficial zone versus the no-P188 group. At 24 h the percentages of live cells in all three zones of the P188-treated explants were significantly greater than in the no treatment group. This study showed that P188 surfactant could help restore the integrity of cell membranes in cartilage damaged by blunt mechanical trauma. With the ability of P188 to ?save? chondrocytes from early necrotic death using in vitro chondral explants, its role in prevention of a post-traumatic osteo-arthritis in a diarthrodial joint should be further explored using in vivo animal models. ? 2004 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Objectives:? High resolution two-dimensional ultrasound (2D US) difficulty in evaluation of some scrotal mass lesions is not frequent. The aim of the present study was to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic performance of three-dimensional ultrasound extended imaging (3D XI) in characterization of those lesions. Methods:? The study protocol had the approval of the University's review board all participants' informed consents were obtained. The study included 28 selected patients (12 testicular and 16 para-testicular mass lesions) examined by 2D US and 3D XI applications including computed multi-slice view (MSV) and multi-resolution enhanced images (XI MR). Results were correlated with histopathological findings. Results:? Two-dimensional ultrasound did not adequately characterize 28 patients out of 329 (8.5%). 3D XI interrogation was an easy procedure and distinctive of the pathological findings in 27 patients out of 28 (96.4%). The performance of XI MR with respect to characterization provided additional diagnostic information over MSV. Conclusions:? The performance of 3D XI with respect to testicular mass characterization proved better than static 2D US. Subsequently, the results of this study suggest that the routine use of 2D US in diagnosis of scrotal mass lesions should preferably be upgraded to 3D XI methods.

AB  - Abstract The pass rate in the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine Fellowship exams between 1996 and 2003 inclusive averaged 61%, substantially lower than that of other specialties with comparable training structures. The explanation for this pass rate, which many would judge as unacceptably low, is likely to be multi-factorial. Possible factors that should be considered include trainee selection, training programme structure, the impact of the Director of Emergency Medicine Training, examination preparation, examination validity and examination reliability. Each of these potential factors needs to be addressed in a systematic fashion in the context of inevitable and increasing internal and external scrutiny of the outcomes of our training programme.

AB  - Abstract The main function of the intervertebral disc is to transmit and attenuate compressive and torsional forces, and stabilize the intervertebral joint. Unfortunately, the disc may be displaced or damaged due to trauma or disease causing the nucleus to herniate and protrude into the vertebral canal or intervertebral foramen. Pressure on the spinal nerve may cause pain or paralysis in the area of its distribution. At present, the surgical procedures used to alleviate this condition include disc excision, and/or spinal fusion. A more desirable situation would involve removing the nucleus pulposus and part or all of the annulus fibrosis and implanting a suitable biofunctional equivalent. Such a prostheis should attenuate stresses and prevent abnormal stress at adjacent intervertebral joints. Maintenance of normal disc height would prevent impingement of the posterior facet joints and facet joint syndrome. In a previous companion paper (J. Applied Biomat. 5:125?132; 1994), the mechanical behavior of disc prostheses manufactured from fiber reinforced, elastomeric thermoset resins were examined. In order to develop devices which were more practical from a manufacturing standpoint and extremely reproducible, the fiber reinforced thermoset resins were replaced by multi-durometer thermoplastic elastomeric materials. In the present paper, the mechanical properties of thermoplastic multicomponent desings have been investigated. ? 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Summary Effects of the impact of a mechanical structure on the human body are of great interest in the understanding of body trauma. Experimental tests have led to first conclusions about the dangerousness of an impact observing impact forces or displacement time history with PMHS (Post Mortem human Subjects). They have allowed providing interesting data for the development and the validation of numerical biomechanical models. These models, widely used in the framework of automotive crashworthiness, have led to the development of numerical-based injury criteria and tolerance thresholds. The aim of this process is to improve the safety of mechanical structures in interaction with the body. In a military context, investigations both at experimental and numerical level are less successfully completed. For both military and civil frameworks, the literature list a number of numerical analysis trying to propose injury mechanisms, and tolerance thresholds based on biofidelic Finite Element (FE) models of different part of the human body. However the link between both frameworks is not obvious, since lots of parameters are different: great mass impacts at relatively low velocity for civil impacts (falls, automotive crashworthiness) and low mass at very high velocity for military loadings (ballistic, blast). In this study, different accident cases were investigated, and replicated with a previously developed and validated FE model of the human thorax named Hermaphrodite Universal Biomechanical YX model (HUBYX model). These previous validations included replications of standard experimental tests often used to validate models in the context of automotive industry, experimental ballistic tests in high speed dynamic impact and also numerical replication of blast loading test ensuring its biofidelity. In order to extend the use of this model in other frameworks, some real-world accidents were reconstructed, and consequences of these loadings on the FE model were explored. These various numerical replications of accident coming from different contexts raise the question about the ability of a FE model to correctly predict several kinds of trauma, from blast or ballistic impacts to falls, sports or automotive ones in a context of numerical injury mechanisms and tolerance limits investigations.

AB  - Introduction Problems in the musculoskeletal system are the most common reason for impaired function and culling in insured riding horses in Sweden. Impaired function of the fetlock, e.g. arthritis, is a believed to be a multi-factorial problem. The aim of the pilot study was to find factors associated with problems in the fetlock. Methods This study focused on horses 5?7 years with fetlock problems. A questionnaire on training and management (feeding, housing, shoeing) was sent to 200 horse-owners with insurance policies on their horses; 100 had claimed insurance compensation for problems in the fetlock (I-horses) and 100 owners had healthy horses that served as controls (C-horses). The results of the proportions in each group were compared with a Chi-squared test. The response rate was 42%. Results The results showed significant differences for training-related factors but not for management-related factors. The healthy C-horses were ridden for a longer period of time at each occasion (58.5 minutes per day) compared to I-horses (51.3 minutes per day) (P?=?0.043). The C-horses jumped once a week and the I-horses 0.5 times per week (P?=?0.0075). There was a tendency for shorter period of training free weeks to be beneficial (C-horses 4.0 weeks, I-horses 5.5 weeks per year; P?=?0.083). A larger proportion of the I-horses participated in the Swedish Riding Horse Quality Test for four-year old horses (P?=?0.043). Conclusions The results indicated that training-related factors were associated with whether a horse remained healthy or not. Further studies on training and educational systems of young horses are needed to prevent impaired function. Ethical Animal Research No animals were used in the study. Sources of funding:?This study was financed by the insurance company ?Agria? which approved submission of the results for presentation and publication in conjunction with ICEEP 9. Competing interests:?none.

AB  - The probability of physical abuse (PA) is high in children with occult rib fractures. Other causes include non-intentional trauma, post surgery and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Bone fragility increases the risk of fractures, namely metabolic bone disease of prematurity (MBDP), osteogenesis imperfecta, rickets and rare metabolic bone diseases. ?Occult rib fractures have a high probability of physical abuse? This case series describes 61 children under two years of age with rib fractures and associations with clinical and radiological features and aetiology. There were 20 cases of PA, 11 post surgical and three non-intentional trauma. Two cases had fractures following cardiopulmonary resuscitation, 18 MBDP and one metabolic bone disease. In six cases, the cause remained unknown. The number and distribution of rib fractures and the age of infants did not discriminate between MBDP and PA. Fractures were predominantly posterior, postero-lateral or lateral. All cases of MBDP had a gestational age of 31 weeks or less and birth weight?<?1.25 kg. Each child with MBDP had at least one additional risk factor. Chronic lung disease was recorded in seven, prolonged total parenteral nutrition in ten, steroid use in four, furosemide medication in eight and necrotising enterocolitis in three. All PA cases had other associated injuries or signs of neglect. We recommend a comprehensive assessment of infants with occult rib fractures including an examination to exclude associated trauma, a child protection assessment and a full clinical assessment to exclude risk factors for co-existing bone fragility. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Messages: The number and distribution of rib fractures and the age of infants do not discriminate between PA and rib fractures seen in MBDP.

AB  - Background? The epidemiology of post-injury multiple organ failure (MOF) is reported to go through changes during the last 15 years. The purpose of this study is to describe the epidemiology of post-injury MOF in Australia. Methods? A 12-month prospective epidemiological study was performed in a Major Trauma Service. Demographics, injury severity (ISS), physiological, MOF status and outcome data was prospectively collected on all trauma patients who met inclusion criteria (ICU admission; ISS?>?15; age?>?18, AIS head <3 and survival >48?hrs). MOF was defined by the Denver MOF score. Data are presented as % or Mean+/?SEM. Univariate statistical comparison was performed (Student t- and X-square tests), p?<?0.05 was considered significant. Results? Twenty-five patients met inclusion criteria (Age 39+/?5, ISS 27+/?3, Male 60%), three patients (12%) developed MOF. The maximum MOF score was 5.7 +/?1, with duration of 2.3+/?0.7 days. Two patients had respiratory and cardiac failure, while one patient had failure of respiratory, cardiac, hepatic and renal systems. All MOF patients survived. MOF patients tend to have longer ICU stays (18+/?5.5 vs 7+/?0.8 p?=?0.17), were older (54+/?17 vs 38+/?5 p?=?0.4). None of the previously described independent predictors (ISS, base deficit, lactate, transfusions) were different when the MOF patients were compared with the non-MOF patients. Conclusion? MOF is not as significant a cause of late trauma death as previously reported internationally. Our preliminary data challenges the timeliness of the 10-year-old independent predictors of post-injury MOF. The epidemiology, the clinical presentation and the independent predictors of post-injury MOF requires reassessment for the Australian context.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?When life-threatening bleeding occurs in patients on warfarin, timely reversal becomes imperative. In the USA, warfarin effect is commonly reversed with fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The use of FFP is complicated by delays in correction, volume overload and often, inadequate correction. Objective:?Evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a protocol for rapid administration of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) in the setting of the urgent need for reversal of warfarin. Methods/patients:?We instituted a policy for rapid delivery and administration of PCC. Appropriate patients received 25?50?U?kg?1 of PCC. The prothrombin time (PT)/International Normalized Ratios (INR) was recorded before and immediately after dosing, and 24?h postdosing. Patients requiring surgical interventions were cleared for the operating room (OR) immediately. Fifty-eight patients were treated, with a median age of 75.5?years (range 26?92). Results:?The median INR on presentation was 3.8 (1.4?52.8). Immediately following PCC administration the median INR was 1.3 (0.9?5.7), only two patients with INRs exceeding 2.0. The benefit was maintained at 24?h with a median INR of 1.5 (1.1?3.4). Four patients experienced thrombotic events during their hospitalization, (two deep vein thrombosis, two non-q-wave myocardial infarction) although none was attributed to PPC therapy. Conclusions:?PCC administration is an effective treatment modality for the correction of warfarin anticoagulation in the urgent setting. Advantages over FFP include more timely correction, absence of volume overload and potentially more complete correction. Broader use of PCC in this setting appears to be appropriate.

AB  - ABSTRACT The community framework this volume champions is a fruitful addition for anthropological bioarchaeologists seeking to understand ancient population dynamics. The breadth illustrates the importance of the concept of community, the difficulty of moving beyond definitions restricted by geography, and particular challenges of bioarchaeological datasets. Population- and spatially-based analyses are critical and generally most appropriate in our discipline; yet, they can inadvertently present pictures of homogeneity that do not accurately characterize the ancient communities we study. We must continue to seek productive ways to appreciate diversity within the ancient communities though contextually based and ?multi-subdisciplinary? approaches. We continue asking in what way the patterns in mortuary and other bioarchaeological variables are culturally meaningful from real or ideal culture perspectives, seeking to move beyond geographically bound approaches.

To assess the efficacy of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-free immunosuppression vs. calcineurin-based immunosuppression in patients receiving expanded criteria donor (ECD) kidneys. Patient and methods:? Thirteen recipients of ECD kidneys were enrolled in this pilot study and treated with induction therapy and maintained on sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and prednisone. A contemporaneous control group was randomly selected comprised of 13 recipients of ECD kidneys who had been maintained on CNI plus MMF and prednisone. Results:? For the study group vs. the control group, two-yr graft survival was 92.3% vs. 84.6% (p?=?NS), two-yr patient survival was 100% vs. 92.3% (p?=?NS) and the acute rejection rates were 23% vs. 31% (p?=?NS), respectively. Renal function was significantly better in the study group compared with control up to the six-month mark, after which, it remained numerically but not statistically significant. Complications were more common in the study group, but serious adverse events requiring discontinuation were rare. Conclusion:? This pilot study demonstrates that CNI-free regimens can be safely implemented in patients receiving ECD kidneys with excellent two-yr patient and graft survival and good renal allograft function. Longer follow-up in larger randomized controlled trials are necessary to establish these findings.

AB  - Abstract A 70-year-old man with a history of peripheral vascular disease was treated initially with antidepressants, then bilateral electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for a depressive illness. Apart from an episode of delirium following ECT he recovered fully. Four years later he relapsed. Low-dose antidepressants caused disorientation and oversedation, as did ECT. Shortly afterwards he developed a multi-infarct state with Parkinsonian symptoms, transient schaemic attacks (TIAs) and cerebrovascular attacks (CVAs). His cognitive deficits implicated pathology in the frontal and subcortical areas of the brain. Postmortem examination confirmed widespread atherosclerotic disease, also cerebrovascular disease. The haemodynamic and cerebral effects of ECT are condidered in the context of vascular disease. It is postulated that ECT given to such patients might cause permanent impairment of cognitive function through ischaemia of an already compromised cerebral circulation. Suggestions are outlined regarding a policy for a more comprehensive assessment of patients with atherosclerotic disease. Deficiencies of ECT procedures are highlighted.

AB  - Abstract In 2017, 1492 patients were added to the pancreas transplant waiting list, 964 listed as active, a slight increase from 2016. This is significant because for the first time in the past decade, the steady downward trend in additions to the waiting list has been reversed. Proportions of pancreas donors with cerebrovascular accident as cause of death decreased, with a concomitant increase in proportions with anoxia and head trauma. This is partly a result of the national opioid crisis, and it reflects increasing use of younger donors for pancreas transplant. The 2017 outcome report remains compromised by previous variation in reporting graft failure. Although the OPTN Pancreas Transplantation Committee has approved more precise definitions of pancreas graft failure, implementation of these definitions took place recently, and the data are not reflected in this report.

AB  - Abstract The morphology of the brain and skull are important in the evaluation of the aging human; however, little is known about how the skull may change with age. The objective of this study was to evaluate the morphological changes of the adult skull using three-dimensional geometric morphometric analysis of thousands of landmarks with the focus on anatomic regions that may be correlated with brain atrophy and head injury. Computed tomography data were collected between ages 20 and 100. Each scan was segmented using thresholding techniques. An atlas image of a 50th percentile skull was registered to each subject scan by computing a series of rigid, affine, and non-linear transformations between atlas space and subject space. Landmarks on the atlas skull were transformed to each subject and partitioned into the inner and outer cranial vault and the cranial fossae. A generalized Procrustes analysis was completed for the landmark sets. The coordinate locations describing the shape of each region were regressed with age to generate a model predicting the landmark location with age. Permutation testing was performed to assess significant changes with age. For the males, all anatomic regions reveal significant changes in shape with age except for the posterior cranial fossa. For the females, only the middle cranial fossa and anterior cranial fossa were found to change significantly in shape. Results of this study are important for understanding the adult skull and how shape changes may pertain to brain atrophy, aging, and injury.

AB  - Abstract Background Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as nausea and bloating, are common in people with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Autonomic dysfunction can lead to changes in the GI secreto-motor function which can be associated with GI symptom development. We hypothesized that regional pH profiles in T1DM differs from health and would be associated with objective physiological/clinical markers. Methods Forty-seven T1DM with confirmed diabetic sensory peripheral neuropathy and 41 healthy age-matched subjects underwent standardized wireless motility capsule testing. T1DM completed the gastroparesis cardinal symptom index (GCSI) and the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale. Disease duration, glycemic control, insulin usage, and 24-hour heart rate variability testing were evaluated. Key Results In comparison to healthy subjects, gastric, and large bowel median pH were lower in T1DM (1.8 ± 1.6 vs 2.9 ± 1.5, P = 0.001 and 6.7 ± 0.6 vs 7.0 ± 0.5, P = 0.003, respectively). Additionally, change in pH across the pylorus was lower while change in pH across the ileocecal junction was higher in T1DM (5.2 ± 1.5 vs 5.8 ± 0.5, P = 0.003 and 1.8 ± 0.4 vs 1.3 ± 0.4, P < 0.0001, respectively). No difference was found in small bowel median pH. Gastric median pH was associated with small bowel transit time (r = 0.30, P = 0.049). Change in pH across the pylorus was negatively associated with fasting glycose (r = ?0.35, P = 0.027). Small bowel median pH was associated with nausea (r = 0.42, P = 0.005) and small bowel transit time (r = 0.48, P = 0.0007). Large bowel median pH was associated with nausea (r = 0.35, P = 0.018) and the total GCSI score (r = 0.34, P = 0.023). Conclusions and Inferences The GI pH profile in T1DM with DSPN is different from healthy subjects. Changes in pH profile may have important therapeutic implications and influence pharmacotherapeutic bioavailability.

AB  - Objective Evaluate the effect of a perioperative intravenous continuous rate infusion (CRI) of metoclopramide on the incidence of aspiration pneumonia in the short term postoperative period in dogs undergoing unilateral arytenoid lateralization. Study Design Prospective, randomized, multi-center clinical trial. Animals 61 client-owned dogs with idiopathic laryngeal paralysis and normal preoperative thoracic radiographs. Methods All dogs underwent unilateral arytenoid lateralization with a uniform anesthetic, analgesic, and management protocol. Dogs in the treatment group received an intravenous CRI of metoclopramide for 24 hours perioperative. All dogs were assessed for clinical signs of aspiration pneumonia based on the results of physical examination and owner interview up to the point of suture removal (10?14 days postoperative). Any dog with suspected aspiration pneumonia had thoracic radiographs performed. Results Six dogs developed aspiration pneumonia in the short term postoperative period (2/28 control dogs and 4/33 treated dogs), accounting for an overall frequency of 10% with no significant difference between control and treated dogs. No variables measured in the study were significantly different between control and treated dogs. Conclusions Perioperative metoclopramide, at the doses used in this study, did not affect the incidence of aspiration pneumonia in the short term postoperative period in dogs with idiopathic laryngeal paralysis undergoing unilateral arytenoid lateralization.

AB  - Objective To determine the in vitro effects of differing growth factor treatments on the fibrochondrogenic potential of fibroblast-like synoviocytes from cruciate ligament deficient femorotibial joints of dogs. Study Design In vitro study. Sample Population Synoviocytes from dogs (n?=?8) with naturally occurring cruciate ligament insufficiency. Methods Synoviocytes were cultured in monolayer and synthesized into tensioned synoviocyte bioscaffolds (TSB) suspended in media containing TGF-?3, or FGF-2, TGF-?1, and IGF-I. The 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay and toluidine blue stain assessed glycosaminoglycan content; hydroxyproline assay, and collagen I and II immunohistochemistry assessed collagen content. Biomechanical properties were determined by materials testing/force?deformation curves. Results All tissue cultures formed tensioned fibrous tissue-like constructs. Mean tissue cellularity and cellular viability was significantly greater in the triple growth factor-treated TSB by 0.09% and 44%, respectively. Percentage collagen content, and relative gene expression for collagen I, II, and aggrecan was not significantly different between groups. Median percentage of GAG content was significantly greater in triple growth factor-treated TSB by 1.6%. Biomechanical properties were not different in compression. Triple growth factor-treated TSB were significantly stronger in toughness, peak load to failure, and stiffness in tension. Conclusions TGF-?3 cultured bioscaffolds failed to outperform triple growth factor-treated TSB. Architectural extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and cellularity likely explained the differences between groups. TGF-?3 alone cannot be recommended at this time for in vitro formation of autologous fibrocartilage bioscaffolds for meniscal deficiency.
