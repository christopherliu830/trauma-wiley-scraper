AB  - Abstract Background Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as nausea and bloating, are common in people with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Autonomic dysfunction can lead to changes in the GI secreto-motor function which can be associated with GI symptom development. We hypothesized that regional pH profiles in T1DM differs from health and would be associated with objective physiological/clinical markers. Methods Forty-seven T1DM with confirmed diabetic sensory peripheral neuropathy and 41 healthy age-matched subjects underwent standardized wireless motility capsule testing. T1DM completed the gastroparesis cardinal symptom index (GCSI) and the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale. Disease duration, glycemic control, insulin usage, and 24-hour heart rate variability testing were evaluated. Key Results In comparison to healthy subjects, gastric, and large bowel median pH were lower in T1DM (1.8 ± 1.6 vs 2.9 ± 1.5, P = 0.001 and 6.7 ± 0.6 vs 7.0 ± 0.5, P = 0.003, respectively). Additionally, change in pH across the pylorus was lower while change in pH across the ileocecal junction was higher in T1DM (5.2 ± 1.5 vs 5.8 ± 0.5, P = 0.003 and 1.8 ± 0.4 vs 1.3 ± 0.4, P < 0.0001, respectively). No difference was found in small bowel median pH. Gastric median pH was associated with small bowel transit time (r = 0.30, P = 0.049). Change in pH across the pylorus was negatively associated with fasting glycose (r = ?0.35, P = 0.027). Small bowel median pH was associated with nausea (r = 0.42, P = 0.005) and small bowel transit time (r = 0.48, P = 0.0007). Large bowel median pH was associated with nausea (r = 0.35, P = 0.018) and the total GCSI score (r = 0.34, P = 0.023). Conclusions and Inferences The GI pH profile in T1DM with DSPN is different from healthy subjects. Changes in pH profile may have important therapeutic implications and influence pharmacotherapeutic bioavailability.

AB  - Objective Evaluate the effect of a perioperative intravenous continuous rate infusion (CRI) of metoclopramide on the incidence of aspiration pneumonia in the short term postoperative period in dogs undergoing unilateral arytenoid lateralization. Study Design Prospective, randomized, multi-center clinical trial. Animals 61 client-owned dogs with idiopathic laryngeal paralysis and normal preoperative thoracic radiographs. Methods All dogs underwent unilateral arytenoid lateralization with a uniform anesthetic, analgesic, and management protocol. Dogs in the treatment group received an intravenous CRI of metoclopramide for 24 hours perioperative. All dogs were assessed for clinical signs of aspiration pneumonia based on the results of physical examination and owner interview up to the point of suture removal (10?14 days postoperative). Any dog with suspected aspiration pneumonia had thoracic radiographs performed. Results Six dogs developed aspiration pneumonia in the short term postoperative period (2/28 control dogs and 4/33 treated dogs), accounting for an overall frequency of 10% with no significant difference between control and treated dogs. No variables measured in the study were significantly different between control and treated dogs. Conclusions Perioperative metoclopramide, at the doses used in this study, did not affect the incidence of aspiration pneumonia in the short term postoperative period in dogs with idiopathic laryngeal paralysis undergoing unilateral arytenoid lateralization.

AB  - Abstract The human interosseous membrane (IOM) is a fundamental stabilizer during forearm rotation. To investigate the dynamic aspects of forearm stability, we analyzed sensory nerve endings in the IOM. The distal oblique bundle (DOB), the distal accessory band (DAB), the central band (CB), the proximal accessory band (PAB), the dorsal oblique accessory cord (DOAC) and the proximal oblique cord (POC) were dissected from 11 human cadaver forearms. Sensory nerve endings were analyzed at two levels per specimen as total cell amount/mm2 after immunofluorescence staining with low-affinity neurotrophin receptor p75, protein gene product 9.5, S-100 protein and 4?,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole on an Apotome microscope, according to Freeman and Wyke?s classification. Sensory nerve endings were significantly more commonly found to be equally distributed throughout the structures, rather than being epifascicular, interstitial, or close to the insertion into bone (P ≤ 0.001, respectively). Free nerve endings were the predominant mechanoreceptor in all six structures, with highest density in the DOB, followed by the POC (P ≤ 0.0001, respectively). The DOB had the highest density of Pacini corpuscles. The DOAC and CB had the lowest amounts of sensory innervation. The high density of sensory corpuscles in the DOB, PAB and POC indicate that proprioceptive control of the compressive and directional muscular forces acting on the distal and proximal radioulnar joints is monitored by the DOB, PAB and POC, respectively, due to their closed proximity to both joints, whereas the central parts of the IOM act as structures of passive restraint.

AB  - Background To develop a screening tool to identify patients at risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) within 24?h of a patient's admission to intensive care unit (ICU). Methods Prospective, observational study of 403 consecutively enrolled patients with an indwelling catheter, admitted to a mixed medical-surgical ICU in a tertiary referral, university hospital. Intra-abdominal pressure was measured at least twice daily and IAH and ACS defined as per consensus definitions. Results Thirty-nine per cent of patients developed IAH and 2% developed ACS. Abdominal distension, hemoperitoneum/pneumoperitoneum/intra-peritoneal fluid collection, obesity, intravenous fluid received >?2.3?l, abbreviated Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score >?4 points and lactate >?1.4?mmol/l were identified as independent predictors of IAH upon admission to ICU. The presence of three or more of these risk factors at admission identified patients that would develop IAH with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 76%, the development of grades II, III and IV IAH with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 62%. Patients that developed IAH required a significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU care. Patients that developed grades II?IV IAH had a significantly higher rate of ICU mortality. Conclusion IAH is a common clinical entity in the intensive care setting that is associated with morbidity and mortality. A screening tool, based on data readily available within a patient's first 24?h in ICU, was developed and effectively identified patients that required intra-abdominal pressure monitoring.

AB  - Key points Thermal and hypoxic stress commonly coexist in environmental, occupational and clinical settings, yet how the brain tolerates these multi-stressor environments is unknown Core cooling by 1.0°C reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) by 20?30% and cerebral oxygen delivery (CDO2) by 12?19% at sea level and high altitude, whereas core heating by 1.5°C did not reliably reduce CBF or CDO2 Oxygen content in arterial blood was fully restored with acclimatisation to 4330 m, but concurrent cold stress reduced CBF and CDO2 Gross indices of cognition were not impaired by any combination of thermal and hypoxic stress despite large reductions in CDO2 Chronic hypoxia renders the brain susceptible to large reductions in oxygen delivery with concurrent cold stress, which might make monitoring core temperature more important in this context Abstract Real-world settings are composed of multiple environmental stressors, yet the majority of research in environmental physiology investigates these stressors in isolation. The brain is central in both behavioural and physiological responses to threatening stimuli and, given its tight metabolic and haemodynamic requirements, is particularly susceptible to environmental stress. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF, duplex ultrasound), cerebral oxygen delivery (CDO2), oesophageal temperature, and arterial blood gases during exposure to three commonly experienced environmental stressors ? heat, cold and hypoxia ? in isolation, and in combination. Twelve healthy male subjects (27 ± 11 years) underwent core cooling by 1.0°C and core heating by 1.5°C in randomised order at sea level; acute hypoxia ( = 50 mm Hg) was imposed at baseline and at each thermal extreme. Core cooling and heating protocols were repeated after 16 ± 4 days residing at 4330 m to investigate any interactions with high altitude acclimatisation. Cold stress decreased CBF by 20?30% and CDO2 by 12?19% (both P < 0.01) irrespective of altitude, whereas heating did not reliably change either CBF or CDO2 (both P > 0.08). The increases in CBF with acute hypoxia during thermal stress were appropriate to maintain CDO2 at normothermic, normoxic values. Reaction time was faster and slower by 6?9% with heating and cooling, respectively (both P < 0.01), but central (brain) processes were not impaired by any combination of environmental stressors. These findings highlight the powerful influence of core cooling in reducing CDO2. Despite these large reductions in CDO2 with cold stress, gross indices of cognition remained stable.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Leakage of serum proteins into the brain parenchyma has been repeatedly used as evidence of blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage in experimental and human studies. However, there is no consensus in the literature concerning this phenomenon in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have examined this question by comparing frontal lobe sections in seven groups of patients: Multi-infarct dementia (n= 6), AD with (n= 10) and without (n= 10) infarcts, age-matched controls with (n= 10) and without (n= 10) infarcts, controls with neurodegenerative diseases other than AD, and young controls (n= 10). An additional series compared prospectively followed patients with a diagnosis of either multi-infarct dementia (n= 5) or AD (n= 4). Albumin was detected in white-matter astrocytes in all cases, without significant variation in intensity. In addition, diverse combinations of neurons, astrocytes, and (in AD patients) senile plaques were present in the cerebral cortex in an inconsistent manner. Semiquantitative analysis showed no statistically significant differences among groups. Anti-IgG labeled astrocytes in infarcts only. Complement C3c component was detected in rare amyloid plaques in a minority (15%) of AD cases. Selective labeling of AD-specific lesions in a patchy manner was observed for serum amyloid P. We conclude that there is no immunohistochemical evidence of alteration of the BBB in Alzheimer's disease with or without vascular factors or in old age. Serum amyloid P binds avidly to AD lesions, but our findings are consistent with leakage through the BBB during the agonal or immediate postmortem period. Finally, no specific pattern of abnormality in the BBB was detected in multi-infarct dementia.

AB  - Objective To determine the in vitro effects of differing growth factor treatments on the fibrochondrogenic potential of fibroblast-like synoviocytes from cruciate ligament deficient femorotibial joints of dogs. Study Design In vitro study. Sample Population Synoviocytes from dogs (n?=?8) with naturally occurring cruciate ligament insufficiency. Methods Synoviocytes were cultured in monolayer and synthesized into tensioned synoviocyte bioscaffolds (TSB) suspended in media containing TGF-?3, or FGF-2, TGF-?1, and IGF-I. The 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay and toluidine blue stain assessed glycosaminoglycan content; hydroxyproline assay, and collagen I and II immunohistochemistry assessed collagen content. Biomechanical properties were determined by materials testing/force?deformation curves. Results All tissue cultures formed tensioned fibrous tissue-like constructs. Mean tissue cellularity and cellular viability was significantly greater in the triple growth factor-treated TSB by 0.09% and 44%, respectively. Percentage collagen content, and relative gene expression for collagen I, II, and aggrecan was not significantly different between groups. Median percentage of GAG content was significantly greater in triple growth factor-treated TSB by 1.6%. Biomechanical properties were not different in compression. Triple growth factor-treated TSB were significantly stronger in toughness, peak load to failure, and stiffness in tension. Conclusions TGF-?3 cultured bioscaffolds failed to outperform triple growth factor-treated TSB. Architectural extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and cellularity likely explained the differences between groups. TGF-?3 alone cannot be recommended at this time for in vitro formation of autologous fibrocartilage bioscaffolds for meniscal deficiency.

To compare biomechanical properties of 3 new generation polyethylene sutures (FiberTape [FT], FiberWire [FW], and OrthoFiber [OF]) with nylon leader line (NL) for use during extraarticular fixation of cranial cruciate deficient stifles. Study Design? In vitro biomechanical testing of suture loops under monotonic tensile and cyclical loading until failure. Sample Population? Constructs of FT, FW, OF, and NL. Methods? Twenty loops of each of 12 combinations of fixation and suture had monotonic tensile and cyclical loading. Two knotting techniques (square knot [SQ], slip knot [SL]) and a crimp clamp (CR) system were evaluated. Elongation, stiffness, and strength of constructs was tested. The main effects of group, loop material, and their interaction were evaluated. Results? Knotted FT, FW, and OF had less elongation than knotted NL under monotonic tensile and cyclical loading. Under monotonic tensile loading, knotted FT and OF were stiffer than knotted NL. CR FT, CR FW, and CR OF were stiffer than CR NL and CR FT, CR FW, and CR OF were stiffer than knotted FT, FW, and OF. FW and OF knotted loops were weaker than knotted NL. CR FT was stronger than CR NL. CR FT and CR OF were weaker than knotted FT and OF. Conclusions? Polyethylene sutures are stronger, stiffer and elongate less than nylon leader. Crimping suture alters the biomechanical properties of the loop. Clinical Relevance? FW, FT, and OF may perform better in reconstructive procedures, where increased strength and stiffness are considered to be beneficial.

AB  - Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a severe complication after liver transplantation that can result in increased morbidity and mortality. Few data are available regarding risk factors, classification, and treatment of PVT after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Between January 2004 and November 2014, 421 adult-to-adult LDLTs were performed at our institution, and they were included in the analysis. Perioperative characteristics and outcomes from patients with no-PVT (n = 393) were compared with those with de novo PVT (total portal vein thrombosis [t-PVT]; n = 28). Ten patients had early portal vein thrombosis (e-PVT) occurring within 1 month, and 18 patients had late portal vein thrombosis (l-PVT) appearing later than 1 month after LDLT. Analysis of perioperative variables determined that splenectomy was associated with t-PVT (hazard ratio [HR], 3.55; P = 0.01), e-PVT (HR, 4.96; P = 0.04), and l-PVT (HR, 3.84; P = 0.03). In contrast, donor age was only found as a risk factor for l-PVT (HR, 1.05; P = 0.01). Salvage rate for treatment in e-PVT and l-PVT was 100% and 50%, respectively, without having an early event of rethrombosis. Mortality within 30 days did not show a significant difference between groups (no-PVT, 2% versus e-PVT, 10%; P = 0.15). No significant differences were found regarding 1-year (89% versus 92%), 5-year (79% versus 82%), and 10-year (69% versus 79%) graft survival between the t-PVT and no-PVT groups, respectively (P = 0.24). The 1-year (89% versus 96%), 5-year (82% versus 86%), and 10-year (79% versus 83%) patient survival was similar for the patients in the no-PVT and t-PVT groups, respectively (P = 0.70). No cases of graft loss occurred as a direct consequence of PVT. In conclusion, the early diagnosis and management of PVT after LDLT can lead to acceptable early and longterm results without affecting patient and graft survival.

AB  - Donation after cardiac death (DCD) liver grafts are associated with inferior clinical outcomes and high discard rates because of poor graft quality. We investigated the predictive value of DCD liver biopsy for the pretransplant graft quality evaluation. DCD liver transplants that took place between October 2010 and April 2014 were included (n?=?127). Histological features of graft biopsy samples were analyzed to assess risk factors for graft survival. Macrovesicular steatosis?≥?20% [hazard ratio (HR)?=?2.973; P?=?0.045] and sinusoidal neutrophilic infiltrate (HR?=?6.969; P?=?0.005) were confirmed as independent risk factors for graft survival; hepatocellular swelling, vacuolation, and necrosis failed to show prognostic value. Additionally, a donor serum total bilirubin level?≥?34.2 ?mol/L was also associated with a lower probability of graft survival. Our analysis indicates that macrovesicular steatosis?≥?20% and sinusoidal neutrophilic infiltrate are novel and useful histological markers for DCD liver grafts with unacceptable quality. This finding can be used by transplant surgeons to improve DCD liver acceptance protocols. Liver Transpl 21:838?846, 2015. ? 2015 AASLD.

AB  - Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI)-induced neurodegeneration leads to irreversible and devastating motor and sensory dysfunction. Post-traumatic outcomes are determined by events occurring during the first 24 hours after SCI. An increase in extracellular glutamate concentration to neurotoxic levels is one of the earliest events after SCI. We used Affymetrix DNA oligonucleotide microarrays (with 1,322 DNA probes) analysis to measure gene expression in order to test the hypothesis that SCI-induced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation triggers significant postinjury transcriptional changes. Here we report that SCI, 1 hour after trauma, induced change in mRNA levels of 165 genes and expression sequence tags (ESTs). SCI affected mRNA levels of those genes that regulate predominantly transcription factors, inflammation, cell survival, and membrane excitability. We also report that NMDA receptor inhibition (with -(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]-cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate [MK-801]) reversed the effect of SCI on about 50% of the SCI-affected mRNAs. Especially interesting is the finding that NMDA receptor activation participates in the up-regulation of inflammatory factors. Therefore, SCI-induced NMDA receptor activation is one of the dominant, early signals after trauma that leads to changes in mRNA levels of a number of genes relevant to recovery processes. The majority of MK-801 effects on the SCI-induced mRNA changes reported here are novel. Additionally, we found that the MK-801 treatment also changed the mRNA levels of 168 genes and ESTs that had not been affected by SCI alone, and that some of their gene products could have harmful effects on SCI outcome. ? 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Objective? To introduce the pathophysiological Tulip classification system for underlying cause and mechanism of perinatal mortality based on clinical and pathological findings for the purpose of counselling and prevention. Design? Descriptive. Setting? Tertiary referral teaching hospital. Population? Perinatally related deaths. Methods? A classification consisting of groups of cause and mechanism of death was drawn up by a panel through the causal analysis of the events related to death. Individual classification of cause and mechanism was performed by assessors. Panel discussions were held for cases without consensus. Main outcome measures? Inter-rater agreement for cause and mechanism of death. Results? The classification consists of six main causes with subclassifications: (1) congenital anomaly (chromosomal, syndrome and single- or multiple-organ system), (2) placenta (placental bed, placental pathology, umbilical cord complication and not otherwise specified [NOS]), (3) prematurity (preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, preterm labour, cervical dysfunction, iatrogenous and NOS), (4) infection (transplacental, ascending, neonatal and NOS), (5) other (fetal hydrops of unknown origin, maternal disease, trauma and out of the ordinary) and (6) unknown. Overall kappa coefficient for agreement for cause was 0.81 (95% CI 0.80?0.83). Six mechanisms were drawn up: cardio/circulatory insufficiency, multi-organ failure, respiratory insufficiency, cerebral insufficiency, placental insufficiency and unknown. Overall kappa for mechanism was 0.72 (95% CI 0.70?0.74). Conclusions? Classifying perinatal mortality to compare performance over time and between centres is useful and necessary. Interpretation of classifications demands consistency. The Tulip classification allows unambiguous classification of underlying cause and mechanism of perinatal mortality, gives a good inter-rater agreement, with a low percentage of unknown causes, and is easily applicable in a team of clinicians when guidelines are followed.

AB  - Background and Objectives This study challenges the currently accepted treatment parameters of waiting 1 year following burn injury to treat the resultant scarring. It assesses the impact of treating burn and trauma wounds at less than 3 months of injury on scar formation, providing a new temporal paradigm to patients in the prevention and minimization of scar formation. Study Design/Materials and Methods This randomized clinical trial included 19 patients with moderate-to-severe acute burn injuries less than 3 months from injury. The treatment areas underwent three fractional ablative CO2 laser treatments at 8-week intervals. The primary outcomes were improvement in the Manchester Scar Scale (MSS) and photography. Secondary outcomes were optical coherence tomography (OCT), treatment time, immediate post-treatment response, and histology. Results Upon blinded evaluation, 100% of treatment areas were correctly identified when compared with control. MSS scores before and after treatment were totaled with an averaged sum of 13.33 per scar at baseline to 8.39 after treatment, a 63% average improvement versus control (P?<?0.001). Histology and OCT demonstrated a re-organization of the underlying skin structure. The average treatment time was 18?minutes. Immediate post-treatment responses were limited to mild-to-moderate erythema. Conclusions Early intervention with ablative fractional laser on acute traumatic wounds resulted in significant decrease of scar formation compared with untreated areas on the same wounds, providing an impactful new time course to treat severe burn and trauma injuries.

AB  - Abstract Introduction This study was conducted to determine whether an intra-operative ratio of at least 1:1:2 of fresh frozen plasma (FFP):platelets (PLTs):packed red blood cells (pRBCs) improves outcomes in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Methods A single-center, retrospective study of deceased donor OLT recipients (MELD ≥15) requiring intra-operative pRBC transfusion (years 2013-2016). Patients were grouped into those receiving an intra-operative ratio of ≥1:1:2 of FFP:PLTs:pRBCs vs ratios <1:1:2. Results Patients in ≥1:1:2 group (n = 150) and patients in <1:1:2 group (n = 80) were matched for baseline characteristics (P > .05). Patients in the ≥1:1:2 group had lower pRBC and intra-operative blood product requirements (11 ± 0.5 vs 19 ± 1.4 units, P < .001, and 33 ± 1.3 vs 43 ± 3.3 units, P = .006, respectively), improved 1-month mortality (0 vs 8%, P = .002), improved 1-year survival (P = .004), less intra-operative cardiac arrest (3% vs 10%, P = .03), and shorter operating room time (389 ± 7.2 vs 431 ± 17.2 minutes, P = .03). After multivariate adjustment for baseline and intra-operative variables, balanced blood product transfusion (BBPT) was significantly associated with less intra-operative pRBC transfusion (95% confidence interval: 0.60-0.72). Conclusion Balanced blood product transfusion is associated with reduced transfusion requirements in OLT.

AB  - Objectives To determine the efficacy and safety of cimicoxib (Cimalgex?; Vétoquinol SA) for the control of perioperative pain in dogs. Methods A double-blind, randomized, controlled multi-centre field study was conducted in 237 dogs undergoing orthopaedic or soft tissue surgery. Pain was monitored by the attending veterinarian over the 7 days following the surgical procedure using two pain-scoring systems and a visual analogue scale. An enhanced monitoring protocol for postoperative pain was utilized during the first 24 hours after surgery. The dog owner's assessment of perceived analgesia during this time period was also recorded. Results Cimicoxib demonstrated statistically significant non-inferiority compared to carprofen. These findings were confirmed by owners? assessments and by the evolution of the pain scores. Both drugs were well tolerated throughout the study. Clinical Significance Cimicoxib had non-inferior efficacy and tolerability when compared to carprofen for the control of perioperative pain in dogs undergoing orthopaedic or soft tissue surgery.

AB  - Summary Necropsies were performed on 496 horses that had a fatal injury or illness at a California racetrack during the period February 20th 1990 to March 1st 1992. The primary cause of death was categorised by breed, activity at time of injury or illness and organ system affected. Most of the submissions were Thoroughbred horses (432) and Quarter Horses (46). Most of the injuries occurred while racing (42%) and in training sessions (39%); with fewer non-exercise (12%) and accident (7%) related injuries or illnesses. Musculoskeletal injuries accounted for 83% of the Thoroughbred and 80% of the Quarter Horse submissions. The Thoroughbred horses incurred 306 fractures with 263 in the limbs and 90% of those in the forelimbs. The proximal sesamoid bone(s), third metacarpal bone and humerus were the most common bones fractured in Thoroughbred horses and Quarter Horses. Other major causes of death included respiratory, digestive and multi-organ system disorders.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Historically, surgical intervention for liver trauma has been the accepted method of treatment with an associated high percentage of nontherapeutic laparotomies however, conservative management is now advocated in the haemodynamically stable patient. We report our experience of the management of patients admitted with liver trauma. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 75 patients admitted with liver trauma over a 9-year period (1992?2001). Fifty-eight were men (median age 25 years; range 1?76 years). Injury severity was determined using the hepatic injury scale (HIS). Results: Sixty-three patients were referred from other hospitals. Seventy-two patients suffered blunt trauma. Six patients were classified as grade 5 on the HIS, 43 as grade 4, 17 as grade 3, 8 as grade 2 and 1 as grade 1. Fifteen patients underwent surgery at the referring hospital, which involved perihepatic packing in 80 per cent. Of the 48 patients treated conservatively at the referring hospital, 43 were successfully treated with further conservative management. In total 23 patients required laparotomy in our unit, 18 for liver related injuries. Procedures included 3 hepatic resections and 13 for hepatorrhaphy. Median blood requirement in our unit was 2 units. Four patients developed definite biliary complications treated with endoscopic stenting in three cases and percutaneous drainage in one. A further five intra-abdominal collections required percutaneous drainage. The mortality rate was 8 per cent. Conclusion: The majority of patients with liver trauma can be successfully treated with conservative management. In unstable patients initial surgical packing and transfer to a specialist unit is recommended.

AB  - Objectives To review the surgical results and to identify possible parameters influencing the clinical outcomes in an unselected patient collective undergoing minimally invasive lumbar interbody fusion in a spinal care unit. Methods A total of 229 adult patients who underwent minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion between 2008 and 2016 were included in this retrospective analysis. Lumbar fusion was performed using transforaminal interbody fusion (TLIF) devices and posterolateral fusion. To eliminate confounding parameters, in all patients interbody fusion was indicated by lumbar degenerative pathologies, and surgery was performed using the same fusion device. Treatment efficacy was evaluated using scores describing pain (visual analogue scale [VAS]) and health impairment (EQ-5D, Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]). The influence of patient age, obesity, active smoking status, and co-morbidities on clinical outcome and perioperative complications was analyzed. Results The patient population reviewed had improved VAS (P(leg pain) ≤ 0.0001, P(back pain) ≤ 0.0001), ODI (P ≤ 0.0001), EQ-VAS (P ≤ 0.0001), and EQ-5D subscales ?mobility?, ?self-care?, ?pain?, and ?anxiety? (P(mobility) ≤ 0.0001, P(self-care)?=?0.41, P(pain) ≤ 0.0001, P(anxiety)?=?0.011) postoperatively. Neither advanced patient age, nor increased body mass index (BMI), hypertension, or active smoking status had a significantly limiting influence on the success of minimally invasive spinal surgeries (MIS). Duration of surgery strongly correlated with the number of spinal levels treated and with intraoperative blood loss (r?=?0.774, P ≤ 0.0001, n?=?208). Weak positive correlations were found between patient age and duration of surgery (r?=?0.184, P?=?0.005, n?=?229), intraoperative blood loss (r?=?0.165, P?=?0.012, n?=?229), and duration of hospitalization (r?=?0.270, P ≤ 0.0001, n?=?228), respectively. When compared to non-smokers, smokers were younger (P ≤ 0.0001), and had a significantly lower BMI (P?=?0.001), shorter durations of surgery (P ≤ 0.0001), decreased intraoperative blood loss (P?=?0.022), and shorter hospital stays (P?=?0.006), respectively. Complications occurred in 17 patients (7%) and were not affected by patient age, BMI, hypertension, or active smoking status. Conclusion Minimally invasive spinal surgery is a safe and effective treatment option and may be superior to open surgery in subpopulations with significant co-morbidities and risk factors, such as elderly and obese patients as well as patients with an active smoking status.

AB  - Abstract Alcohol dependence is associated with poor sleep quality, which has both been implicated with thalamocortical circuits function. To identify the possible roles of these circuits in the alcohol-sleep association, we investigated the volume of both left and right thalamus and corresponding resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) differences between 15 alcohol-dependent patients (AD) and 15 healthy controls (HC) male participants. The neuroimaging findings were then correlated with clinical variables, that is, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Additionally, mediation analysis was carried out to test whether the thalamocortical RSFC mediates the relationship between drinking behavior and sleep impairments in AD when applicable. We observed a significant positive correlation between AUDIT score and PSQI score in AD. Compared with HC, AD showed reduced RSFC between the left thalamus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and right caudate. We also observed a negative correlation between RSFC of the left thalamus?mPFC and PSQI score in AD. More importantly, the left thalamus?mPFC RSFC strength mediated the relationship between AUDIT score and PSQI score in AD. No significant difference was detected in the normalized volume of both left and right thalamus, and volumes were not significantly correlated with clinical variables. Our results demonstrate that AD show abnormal interactions within thalamocortical circuits in association with drinking behaviors and sleep impairments. It is hoped that our study focusing on thalamocortical circuits could provide new information on potential novel therapeutic targets for treatment of sleep impairment in alcohol-dependent patients.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To establish a linear measuring method in computed tomographic (CT) images to predict the displacement of the globe late after orbital blowout fracture. Methods Subjects were retrospectively included. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) adult subjects (≥18 years old at the time of trauma); (2) unilateral orbital medial-wall and/or floor fractures; (3) CT examination at least 30 days after trauma. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) facial or orbital fracture extending to other parts of the orbit than medial-wall and/or floor; (2) history of orbital or ocular abnormality other than the orbital trauma; (3) severe ocular trauma accompanied by the orbital trauma; (4) orbital fracture treated surgically before the CT examination. A co-ordinate system was built based on the orbital CT scans. Displacements of orbital walls, displacement of the globe and relative location of the fracture site were measured. Correlations between the variables were investigated. Results Ninety-nine per cent of fracture sites of the medial wall and 100% of fracture sites of the floor were posterior to the centre of the unaffected globe. The affected globe moved significantly medially (p < 0.001) and backwards (p < 0.001) in pure medial-wall fracture; backwards (p < 0.001) and downwards (p = 0.017) in pure floor fracture; and medially (p < 0.001), backwards (p < 0.001) and downwards (p < 0.001) in medial-wall and floor fractures. Displacement of the globe was correlated with displacements of the orbital walls, and the regression formulae were therefore fitted. Application of the formulae revealed that the same extent of orbital wall displacement caused more displacement of the globe in female patients than in male patients. Conclusions A linear measuring method in a three-dimensional co-ordinate system was established to identify the displacements of orbital walls and the displacement of the globe in orbital blowout fractures. The regression formulae generated in this study might be used in clinical practice to predict late displacement of the globe by measuring the displacements of orbital walls.
