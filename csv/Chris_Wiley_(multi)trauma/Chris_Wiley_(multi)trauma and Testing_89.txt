AB  - Summary.? Although up to 30% of babies born with haemophilia do not have a family history of the disorder, the remaining 70% are born in families where haemophilia has been diagnosed. It has been estimated that for each male with haemophilia, there are five potential female carriers. Such women will benefit from knowledge of both their genetic (mutation present or not) and phenotype (level of plasma factor activity) status. Genetic counselling services to provide information and testing, together with plasma factor measurement, should be offered where available to all women at risk of being carriers. It is critical that women know their plasma factor measurement as they may have mild haemophilia (factor 5?30%, reference range 50?150%) which requires management at times of medical and surgical procedures and following trauma. Close liaison between adult and paediatric haemophilia centres and obstetric?gynaecology units is important to ensure that clinical carers identify and address carriers? needs. Genetic testing should be performed only after a potential carrier has been counselled and supported to receive such information. There is no coercion to accept such testing. An advantage of genetic testing is to then discuss pre-implantation genetic diagnosis which is an ex-viro form of prenatal diagnosis. This can assist couples at risk of having a child with haemophilia who wish to reduce their anxieties about reproduction. Approximately 4% of boys with haemophilia, born in countries with good maternal care, will have intracranial haemorrhage in the neonatal period. There are no high-level evidence-based guidelines for the management of delivery or of the newborn with haemophilia. Obstetricians or other birth attendants need to be advised of the possibility of delivery of a boy with haemophilia and seek support from a haemophilia specialist during the pregnancy. The mother can then be monitored and plans for delivery be developed between her medical consultants and discussed with her. It is always preferable for a carrier to know of her genetic and phenotypic status before becoming pregnant so that she is informed as to her options and requirements for safe delivery.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To establish a linear measuring method in computed tomographic (CT) images to predict the displacement of the globe late after orbital blowout fracture. Methods Subjects were retrospectively included. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) adult subjects (≥18 years old at the time of trauma); (2) unilateral orbital medial-wall and/or floor fractures; (3) CT examination at least 30 days after trauma. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) facial or orbital fracture extending to other parts of the orbit than medial-wall and/or floor; (2) history of orbital or ocular abnormality other than the orbital trauma; (3) severe ocular trauma accompanied by the orbital trauma; (4) orbital fracture treated surgically before the CT examination. A co-ordinate system was built based on the orbital CT scans. Displacements of orbital walls, displacement of the globe and relative location of the fracture site were measured. Correlations between the variables were investigated. Results Ninety-nine per cent of fracture sites of the medial wall and 100% of fracture sites of the floor were posterior to the centre of the unaffected globe. The affected globe moved significantly medially (p < 0.001) and backwards (p < 0.001) in pure medial-wall fracture; backwards (p < 0.001) and downwards (p = 0.017) in pure floor fracture; and medially (p < 0.001), backwards (p < 0.001) and downwards (p < 0.001) in medial-wall and floor fractures. Displacement of the globe was correlated with displacements of the orbital walls, and the regression formulae were therefore fitted. Application of the formulae revealed that the same extent of orbital wall displacement caused more displacement of the globe in female patients than in male patients. Conclusions A linear measuring method in a three-dimensional co-ordinate system was established to identify the displacements of orbital walls and the displacement of the globe in orbital blowout fractures. The regression formulae generated in this study might be used in clinical practice to predict late displacement of the globe by measuring the displacements of orbital walls.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis Estimate the incidence rate and provide basic descriptive epidemiologic characteristics of plunging ranulas in a multi-ethnic population. Study Design Case series with chart review. Methods The study group comprised all Counties Manukau Health (CMH, Manukau City, Auckland, New Zealand) patients presenting to the CMH Department of Otolaryngology with a diagnosis of plunging ranula from January 2001 to December 2013, as recorded in the departmental case register. Non-CMH domicile patients were excluded. South Auckland comprised the base population, as serviced by CMH. The 2006 New Zealand census data was used for population demographics. Results A total of 134 cases of plunging ranula were identified. The overall annual crude incidence rate was 2.4 per 100,000 person-years. The gender specific incidence rate for males was 3.2 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.5. 3.9) and for females was 2.0 per 100,000 (95% CI: 1.5, 2.6). The overall age-adjusted annual incidence rate was 2.6 per 100,000 (95% CI: 2.1, 3.0). The age-adjusted incidence was highest among Maori (6.7 per 100,000, 95% CI 4.9, 8.4), followed by Pacific Island (4.4 per 100,000, 95% CI 3.2, 5.6), Asian (0.7 per 100,000, 95% CI 0.2, 1.2), and European population (0.6 per 100,000, 95% CI 0.3, 0.8). Conclusion We have quantified for the first time the age-specific and age-adjusted incidence rates for plunging ranula by gender and ethnicity. The results show a likely underlying genetic predisposition for this condition, possibly with a superimposed environmental acquired factor relating to external, minor blunt trauma to the neck.

AB  - Background There are 4.8 million emergency department (ED) visits for traumatic brain injury (TBI) annually in the United States. Many of these patients do not receive educational information or follow-up care. Aims of the Study Our institution implemented a Neurotrauma Hotline for TBI patients. This study describes our implementation and utilization of a Neurotrauma Hotline at a Level I trauma center. Methods Callers and outcomes of calls to the hotline over a 12-month period were analyzed. Correlation analysis was done to assess relationship between hotline calls and TBI clinic volumes. Results There were 1205 calls to the hotline. Calls were most commonly from internal providers or patients, with 338 repeat callers. The call reason was frequently an appointment (36.8%) or advice (32.1%). There were 334 TBI clinic visits, and however, there was no statistically significant correlation between number of hotline calls and number of clinic visits (r = .417; P = .177). Conclusions There was widespread utilization of our hotline. Other institutions wishing to adopt similar practices can expect that the majority of calls will be for appointment scheduling or clinical advice. Further work is needed to determine whether implementation of a Neurotrauma Hotline improves resource utilization and patient outcomes.

AB  - Objectives. The current study examined the types of borderline personality profiles, associated psychological disorders and stressful life-events. Design. Data from the British Psychiatric Morbidity Survey were used to examine homogeneous subtypes of participants based on their responses to nine borderline personality disorder (BPD) criteria. Methods. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify homogeneous groups, or classes, of individuals. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to estimate the association between classes and associated psychological disorders and stressful life-events. Results. A 4-class solution provided the best fit, ranging from a class with a low probability of showing any BPD symptoms to a class whose members had a relatively high probability of endorsing all criteria. Severity of BPD was associated with higher co-morbidity and higher stressful life-events. Conclusions. Results suggest that four discrete classes make up the borderline continuum.

AB  - Abstract Alcohol dependence is associated with poor sleep quality, which has both been implicated with thalamocortical circuits function. To identify the possible roles of these circuits in the alcohol-sleep association, we investigated the volume of both left and right thalamus and corresponding resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) differences between 15 alcohol-dependent patients (AD) and 15 healthy controls (HC) male participants. The neuroimaging findings were then correlated with clinical variables, that is, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Additionally, mediation analysis was carried out to test whether the thalamocortical RSFC mediates the relationship between drinking behavior and sleep impairments in AD when applicable. We observed a significant positive correlation between AUDIT score and PSQI score in AD. Compared with HC, AD showed reduced RSFC between the left thalamus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and right caudate. We also observed a negative correlation between RSFC of the left thalamus?mPFC and PSQI score in AD. More importantly, the left thalamus?mPFC RSFC strength mediated the relationship between AUDIT score and PSQI score in AD. No significant difference was detected in the normalized volume of both left and right thalamus, and volumes were not significantly correlated with clinical variables. Our results demonstrate that AD show abnormal interactions within thalamocortical circuits in association with drinking behaviors and sleep impairments. It is hoped that our study focusing on thalamocortical circuits could provide new information on potential novel therapeutic targets for treatment of sleep impairment in alcohol-dependent patients.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Historically, surgical intervention for liver trauma has been the accepted method of treatment with an associated high percentage of nontherapeutic laparotomies however, conservative management is now advocated in the haemodynamically stable patient. We report our experience of the management of patients admitted with liver trauma. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 75 patients admitted with liver trauma over a 9-year period (1992?2001). Fifty-eight were men (median age 25 years; range 1?76 years). Injury severity was determined using the hepatic injury scale (HIS). Results: Sixty-three patients were referred from other hospitals. Seventy-two patients suffered blunt trauma. Six patients were classified as grade 5 on the HIS, 43 as grade 4, 17 as grade 3, 8 as grade 2 and 1 as grade 1. Fifteen patients underwent surgery at the referring hospital, which involved perihepatic packing in 80 per cent. Of the 48 patients treated conservatively at the referring hospital, 43 were successfully treated with further conservative management. In total 23 patients required laparotomy in our unit, 18 for liver related injuries. Procedures included 3 hepatic resections and 13 for hepatorrhaphy. Median blood requirement in our unit was 2 units. Four patients developed definite biliary complications treated with endoscopic stenting in three cases and percutaneous drainage in one. A further five intra-abdominal collections required percutaneous drainage. The mortality rate was 8 per cent. Conclusion: The majority of patients with liver trauma can be successfully treated with conservative management. In unstable patients initial surgical packing and transfer to a specialist unit is recommended.

AB  - Abstract Aims To synthesize the evidence evaluating if blood samples are similar when obtained from peripheral intravenous cannula compared with venepuncture. Design A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken. Data sources Searches were conducted in databases for English language studies between January 2000?December 2018. Review methods The search adhered to the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using Joanna Briggs critical appraisal instruments. The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE. Results Sixteen studies were identified. Findings suggest haemolysis rates are higher in blood sampled from peripheral intravenous cannula. However, haemolysis rates may be lower if a peripheral intravenous cannula blood sampling protocol is followed. For equivalence of blood test results, even though some results were outside the laboratory, allowable error and were outside the Bland?Altman Level of Agreement, none of these values would have required clinical intervention. With regard to the contamination rates of blood cultures, the results were equivocal. Conclusion Further research is required to inform the evidence for best practice recommendations, including, if a protocol for drawing blood from a peripheral cannula is of benefit for specific patient populations and in other settings. Impact Venepuncture can provoke pain, anxiety and cause trauma to patients. Guidelines recommend blood samples from peripheral intravenous cannula be taken only on insertion. Anecdotal evidence suggests drawing blood from existing cannulas may be a common practice. Further research is required to resolve this issue.

AB  - Aim? Genetic testing in the epilepsies is becoming an increasingly accessible clinical tool. Mutations in the sodium channel alpha 1 subunit (SCN1A) gene are most notably associated with Dravet syndrome. This is the first study to assess the impact of SCN1A testing on patient management from both carer and physician perspectives. Method? Participants were identified prospectively from referrals to the Epilepsy Genetics Service in Glasgow and contacted via their referring clinicians. Questionnaires exploring the consequences of SCN1A genetic testing for each case were sent to carers and physicians. Results? Of the 244 individuals contacted, 182 (75%) carried a SCN1A mutation. Carers of 187 (77%) patients responded (90 females, 97 males; mean age at referral 4y 10mo; interquartile range 9y 1mo). Of those participants whose children tested positive for a mutation, 87% reported that genetic testing was helpful, leading to treatment changes resulting in fewer seizures and improved access to therapies and respite care. Out of 187 physicians, 163 responded (87%), of whom 48% reported that a positive test facilitated diagnosis earlier than with clinical and electroencephalography data alone. It prevented additional investigations in 67% of patients, altered treatment approach in 69%, influenced medication choice in 74%, and, through medication change, improved seizure control in 42%. Interpretation? In addition to confirming a clinical diagnosis, a positive SCN1A test result influenced treatment choice and assisted in accessing additional therapies, especially in the very young.

AB  - Abstract How best to support children and young people in foster care remains a challenge for child welfare. There has been little Australian research on the outcomes for children and young people placed in therapeutic foster care (TFC). This article aims to address this knowledge gap, presenting the evaluation of a state-wide model of TFC known as the Circle Program operating in Victoria, Australia. Data sources for the study were case assessment analysis; surveys of foster carers, program workers and other stakeholders in the sector; and both focus groups and individual interviews with foster care workers. The evaluation found that the Circle Program lessened the number of unplanned exits of children from foster placements compared with generalist foster care. Another important finding was that the Circle Program positively influenced foster carers' decisions to stay in the carer role. Key components perceived as contributing to outcomes of the Circle Program included enhanced training of foster carers, intensive carer support, specialist therapeutic support to the child and carer, therapeutic service to family members and a network of services to provide support to the child.

AB  - Abstract The concept of ?learning by doing? has become less acceptable, particularly when invasive procedures and high-risk care are required. Restrictions on medical educators have prompted them to seek alternative methods to teach medical knowledge and gain procedural experience. Fortunately, the last decade has seen an explosion of the number of tools available to enhance medical education: web-based education, virtual reality, and high fidelity patient simulation. This paper presents some of the consensus statements in regard to these tools agreed upon by members of the Educational Technology Section of the 2004 AEM Consensus Conference for Informatics and Technology in Emergency Department Health Care, held in Orlando, Florida. Findings: Web-based teaching: 1) Every ED should have access to medical educational materials via the Internet, computer-based training, and other effective education methods for point-of-service information, continuing medical education, and training. 2) Real-time automated tools should be integrated into Emergency Department Information Systems [EDIS] for contemporaneous education. Virtual reality [VR]: 1) Emergency physicians and emergency medicine societies should become more involved in VR development and assessment. 2) Nationally accepted protocols for the proper assessment of VR applications should be adopted and large multi-center groups should be formed to perform these studies. High-fidelity simulation: Emergency medicine residency programs should consider the use of high-fidelity patient simulators to enhance the teaching and evaluation of core competencies among trainees. Conclusions: Across specialties, patient simulation, virtual reality, and the Web will soon enable medical students and residents to? see one, simulate many, do one competently, and teach everyone.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report intraoperative and major postoperative complications in dogs treated surgically for epiglottic retroversion (ER), compare the incidence of major postoperative complications between procedures, and report survival of surgically treated dogs. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study. Sample population Fifty dogs treated with 78 procedures. Methods Medical records of dogs diagnosed and surgically treated for ER from 2003 to 2017 at 11 institutions were reviewed. Complications were divided into intraoperative and major postoperative complications. Results Intraoperative complications occurred during 2 of 78 (2.6%) procedures. Thirty-six major postoperative complications were documented in 22 dogs after 36 of 74 (48.7%) procedures. Postoperative complications occurred after 7 of 12 (58.3%) nonincisional epiglottopexy, 23 of 43 (53.5%) incisional epiglottopexy, 2 of 4 (50%) partial epiglottectomy, 2 of 12 (16.7%) subtotal epiglottectomy, and 2 of 3 (66.7%) other surgical procedures. Epiglottopexy failure was the most common major postoperative complication. The incidence of major postoperative complications did not differ between procedures (P = .1239), although, when combined, epiglottopexy procedures (30/55) had a higher incidence of complications than epiglottectomy procedures (4/16; P = .048). Thirty (60%) dogs were alive at a median of 928 days (range, 114-2805), 8 (16%) were lost to follow-up after 411 days (range, 43-1158), and 12 (24%) were dead/euthanized after 301.5 days (range, 3-1212). Median survival time was not reached after a median of 716 days. Conclusion Although intraoperative complications were uncommon, major postoperative complications were common, especially after epiglottopexy procedures. Clinical significance Although surgical treatment of ER is associated with a high rate of major postoperative complications, especially epiglottopexy procedures, long-term survival can be achieved.

To date there are no screening instruments that are developed within low- and middle-income countries and validated for that purpose. The present study assesses the cross-cultural validity of the brief, multi-informant and multi-indicator Child Psychosocial Distress Screener (CPDS). Methods:? The CPDS data of total samples in targeted catchment areas of a psychosocial care program in four conflict-affected countries (Burundi n?=?4193; Sri Lanka n?=?2573; Indonesia n?=?1624; Sudan n?=?1629) were studied to examine the cross-cultural construct validity of the CPDS across settings. First, confirmatory factor analyses were done to determine the likelihood of pre-determined theory-based factor structures in each country sample. Second, multi-sample confirmatory factor analyses were done within each country sample to test measurement equivalence of the factor structure as a measure of construct validity. Results:? A 3-factor structure reflecting the theoretical premises of the instrument (e.g., child distress, child resilience and contextual factors) was found in the samples from Burundi, Sri Lanka and Indonesia, albeit with context specific deviations. The robustness of the 3-factor structure as an indicator of construct validity was confirmed within these three samples by means of multi-sample confirmatory factor-analyses. A 3-factor structure was not found in the Sudan sample. Conclusions:? This study demonstrates the comparability of the assessment by the CPDS of the construct ?non-specific psychosocial distress? across three out of four countries. Robustness of the factor structure of the CPDS within different samples refers to the construct validity of the instrument. However, owing to context-specific deviations of inter-item relationships, the CPDS scores cannot be compared cross-culturally, a finding that confirms the need for attention to contextual factors when screening for non-specific psychosocial distress.

AB  - Children comprise 19% of the Australian population. Children are at risk of higher morbidity and mortality in disaster events than adults; however, there is a paucity of paediatric-specific disaster preparedness in Australia. Paediatric disaster plans should be developed, tested and renewed regularly. Plans need to address unaccompanied and unidentified children, medical and psychosocial needs and family reunification. Specific management is required for chemical, biological and radiological events.

AB  - Abstract Objective In Victoria, Australia, Emergency Medical Service (EMS) demand has increased almost 5% per annum over the past 5 years. This may adversely affect response times to time-critical patients. Additionally, >55% of cases have received Code 1 (lights/sirens) responses. Primary telephone triage occurs using the Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS); however, MPDS is reported to be highly sensitive, with common over-triage. The present study describes the methodology applied to better align the response allocated to MPDS determinant codes with patient acuity. Methods Data between October 2013 and August 2014 were extracted from the Ambulance Victoria data warehouse. The decision to allocate MPDS determinant codes to a lower response priority and/or secondary triage was based on epidemiological profiling and, in some cases, expert panel review. Results The review identified 105 MPDS codes receiving a Code 1 response as suitable for a Code 2 (urgent) response, and 221 Code 1 or 2 codes as suitable for secondary triage. Data analysis estimated a reduction in Code 1 responses by 28%, and an increase in the secondary triage caseload by 120%. Modelling also predicted a 2.6 percentage point improvement in the proportion of Code 1 cases attended within 15?min. Conclusion Analysis of a large EMS dataset supported changes to the EMS response priority for a number of MPDS determinant codes. Such changes should improve the alignment between EMS response and patient acuity, and improve response times to time-critical patients. Other EMS with electronic data could consider testing this methodology.

AB  - Abstract Studies presented here, using a murine model of bone morphogenetic protein type 2 (BMP2)-induced heterotopic ossification (HO) show that the protein initiates HO by signaling through progenitors in the endoneurium of peripheral nerves. In the mouse, these cells were identified in the endoneurium one day after BMP2 induction using antibody against phosphoSMAD (PS) 1, 5, and 8. Studies conducted in a tracking mouse that contains a tamoxifen-regulated Wnt1-Cre recombinase crossed with a td Tomato red (TR) reporter (Wnt1CreErt:Ai9Tm) confirmed their neural origin. In this model both BMP2 induction and tamoxifen are absolutely required to induce TR. SP7+(osterix+)TR+ cells were found in the endoneurium on day 1 and associated with bone on day 7. Quantification of TR+ and TR? cells isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting showed that all SP7+ cells were found in the TR+ population, whereas only about 80% of the TR+ cells expressed SP7. Pre-chondrocytes (Sox 9+) and transient brown fat (tBAT, UCP1+) also coexpressed TR, suggesting that the progenitor in nerves is multi-potential. The endoneurium of human nerves near the site of HO contained many PS+ cells, and SP7+ cells were found in nerves and on bone in tissue from patients with HO. Control tissues and nerves did not contain these PS+ and SP7+ cells. Some osteoblasts on bone from patients with HO were positive for PS, suggesting the continued presence of BMP during bone formation. The data suggests that the progenitors for HO are derived from the endoneurium in both the mouse model of HO and in humans with HO. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2017;6:1109?1119

AB  - Researchers have illustrated the deleterious psychological effects that racial discrimination has exerted on Black Americans. The resulting racial stress and trauma (RST) from experiences with discrimination has been linked to negative wellness outcomes and trajectories for Black youth and families. Racial socialization (RS)?defined as the verbal and nonverbal messages that families use to communicate race to their children?can be a cultural strength and has been associated with positive outcomes in Black youth. Furthermore, the Racial Encounter Coping Appraisal and Socialization Theory (RECAST) encourages the frequent and competent use of RS between family members to cope with the negative impact of RST. Guided by RECAST, the purpose of this article is to describe the development of the Engaging, Managing, and Bonding through Race (EMBRace) intervention targeting the RS practices between Black adolescents and families. The authors explore current research on RST, discuss why traditional coping models for stress are inadequate for racially specific stressors, highlight RECAST as a burgeoning racial coping and socialization model, and describe how RS can be used as a tool to intervene within Black families. This is followed by a detailed description of the development and use of the EMBRace intervention which seeks to reduce RST through RS psychoeducation and practice, stress management, and the promotion of bonding in Black families. This article aims to serve as an example of a culturally relevant RS intervention for Black families who may benefit from clinical treatment for psychological distress from racially discriminatory encounters.
