AB  - Purpose In clinical conditions trauma is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Neutrophils play a key role in the development of multiple organ failure after trauma Experimental design To have a detailed understanding of the neutrophil activation at primary stages after trauma, neutrophils are isolated from control and surgical trauma rats in this study. Extracted proteins are analyzed using nano liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Results A total of 2924 rat neutrophil proteins are identified in our analysis, of which 393 are found differentially regulated between control and trauma groups. By using functional pathways analysis of the 190 proteins up-regulated in surgical trauma, we found proteins related to transcription initiation and protein biosynthesis. On the other hand, among the 203 proteins down-regulated in surgical trauma we found enrichment for proteins of the immune response, proteasome degradation and actin cytoskeleton. Overall, enzyme prediction analysis revealed that regulated enzymes are directly involved in neutrophil apoptosis, directional migration and chemotaxis. Our observations are then confirmed by in silico protein?protein interaction analysis. Conclusions and clinical relevance Collectively, our results reveal that neutrophils drastically regulate their biochemical pathways after the early stages of surgical trauma, showing lower activity. This implies higher susceptibility of the trauma patients to infection and bystander tissues damage.

AB  - Abstract We sought to investigate the risk factors and outcome of Ventilator Associated Tracheitis (VAT) according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) definition in pediatric trauma patients who were ventilated for ≥48?hr. In a retrospective cohort study, medical records of all pediatric trauma patients admitted to our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) between April 2002 and April 2007 were reviewed. Medical records were reviewed for patients' demographics, Trauma Injury Severity Score (TISS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), type of trauma, and other potential risk factors prior to the development of VAT (such as hyperglycemia, rate of re-intubation and tracheotomy, presence of chest tubes and central lines, urinary tract infection, seizures, need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, use of total parental nutrition, transfusion, use of H2 blockers, steroids, and pressors/inotropes). Medical records were also reviewed for days of mechanical ventilation, PICU length of stay, and PICU mortality. During the study period, 217 trauma patients were admitted to the PICU, 113 patients met our inclusion criteria and 21.2% (24/113) developed VAT. On average patients with VAT (in comparison to patients without VAT), had a higher TISS score on admission [38.6?±?16.9 vs. 24.2?±?10.6; respectively (P?<?0.01)], longer days of ventilation and PICU length of stay [11.5?±?6.2 vs. 3.7?±?2.3 days (P?<?0.001) and 16.4?±?8.3 vs. 5.4?±?2.8 days (P?<?0.001), respectively]. There was no difference in mortality between the two groups. In a logistic regression model adjusting for possible confounders, the TISS score (adjusted OR 7.53; CI: 2.01?28.14; P?=?0.03 and use of pressors/inotropes (adjusted OR 4.64; CI: 1.28?16.86; P?=?0.01) were the only independent risk factors associated with VAT. We conclude that the severity of illness and use of pressors/inotropes are associated with VAT in pediatric trauma patients. We also conclude that VAT is associated with an increase in days of mechanical ventilation and PICU length of stay in pediatric trauma patients.

AB  - Summary Traumatic injury of the esophagus is extremely uncommon. The aims of this study were to use the Pennsylvania Trauma Outcome Study (PTOS) database to identify clinical factors predictive of esophageal trauma, and to report the morbidity and mortality of this injury. A cross-sectional review of patients presenting to 20 Level I trauma centers in Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2010 was performed. We compared clinical and demographic variables between patients with and without esophageal trauma both prior to and after arrival in the emergency room (ER). Primary mechanism of injury and clinical outcomes were analyzed. There were 231?694 patients and 327 (0.14%) had esophageal trauma. Patients with esophageal trauma were considerably younger than those without this injury. The risk of esophageal trauma was markedly increased in males (odds ratio [OR] = 2.62 [CI 1.98?3.47]). The risk was also increased in African Americans (OR = 4.61 [CI 3.65?5.82]). Most cases were from penetrating gunshot and stab wounds. Only 34 (10.4%) of esophageal trauma patients underwent an upper endoscopy; diagnosis was usually made by CT, surgery, or autopsy. Esophageal trauma patients were more likely to require surgery (35.8% vs. 12.5%; P < 0.001). Patients with esophageal trauma had a substantially higher mortality than those without the injury (20.5% vs. 1.4%; P < 0.005). In logistic regression modeling, traumatic injury of the esophagus (OR = 3.43 [2.50?4.71]) and male gender (OR = 1.52 [1.46?1.59]) were independently associated with mortality. For those patients with esophageal trauma, there was an association between trauma severity and mortality (OR = 1.10 [1.07?1.12]) but not for undergoing surgery within the first 24 hours of hospitalization (OR = 0.84; 0.39?1.83). Our study on traumatic injury of the esophagus is in concordance with previous studies demonstrating that this injury is rare but carries considerable morbidity (?46%) and mortality (?20%). The injury has a higher morbidity and mortality when the thoracic esophagus is involved compared to the cervical esophagus alone. The injury most commonly occurs in younger, Black males suffering gunshot wounds. Efforts to control gun violence in Pennsylvania are of paramount importance.

AB  - Background Shock and severe tissue injury lead to an endogenous coagulopathy mediated by activation of Protein C and hyperfibrinolysis known as acute traumatic coagulopathy. Together, hemodilution, acidosis, inflammation, and hypothermia result in a global trauma-induced coagulopathy. Coagulopathy in trauma is associated with mortality. Early and effective hemostatic resuscitation is critical in restoring perfusion, correcting coagulopathy, and saving lives in exsanguinating trauma. Lyophilized plasma (LP) provides a logistically superior alternative to fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Study Design and Methods Plasma was lyophilized following whole blood collection from anesthetized swine. A series of studies were performed using anesthetized swine subjected to a validated model of polytrauma and hemorrhagic shock including a Grade V liver injury. Animals were randomized to resuscitation using reconstituted LP fluids. Physiologic data and blood loss were measured. Coagulation status and inflammatory mediators were evaluated. Results Full volume reconstituted LP (100%LP) retains on average 86% coagulation factor activity compared to fresh plasma and when used in 1:1 ratios with red blood cells demonstrated superior hemostatic efficacy compared to FFP. Hypertonic LP reconstituted using 50% of the original plasma volume (50%LP) had higher coagulation factor concentrations, was well tolerated in swine, and equally effective compared to 100%LP with respect to physiologic and hemostatic properties. Buffering with ascorbic acid resulted in significant reductions in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6. Conclusion By minimizing the volume of reconstituted LP and optimizing its anti-inflammatory properties, an LP resuscitation fluid may be created to provide effective hemostatic resuscitation with superior logistical properties.

AB  - Abstract This paper presents findings of a common MMPI profile configuration for a small forensic sample (n = 16) of persons traumatized by life-threatening civilian events or as a consequence of combat in the Vietnam War. All subjects were involved in lawsuits in which the issue of compensation, medical benefits, or criminal disposition and sentencing were important concerns. A review of the existing empirical studies using this full MMPI scale as well as the MMPI post-traumatic subscale are discussed. In comparing the civilian and veteran samples on the MMPI clinical, validity, and subscales a number of statistically significant differences were found by analyses of variance and mean comparison tests of the data. While the profile configuration of both groups were similar (elevations on F, 8 and 2 scales), the Vietnam Veteran sample had significantly higher elevations. It was concluded that identifying an MMPI trauma profile and its variations may did in the diagnosis and assessment of post-traumatic stress disorder.

AB  - Abstract Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease confirmed at postmortem. Those at highest risk are professional athletes who participate in contact sports and military personnel who are exposed to repetitive blast events. All neuropathologically confirmed CTE cases, to date, have had a history of repetitive head impacts. This suggests that repetitive head impacts may be necessary for the initiation of the pathogenetic cascade that, in some cases, leads to CTE. Importantly, while all CTE appears to result from repetitive brain trauma, not all repetitive brain trauma results in CTE. Magnetic resonance imaging has great potential for understanding better the underlying mechanisms of repetitive brain trauma. In this review, we provide an overview of advanced imaging techniques currently used to investigate brain anomalies. We also provide an overview of neuroimaging findings in those exposed to repetitive head impacts in the acute/subacute and chronic phase of injury and in more neurodegenerative phases of injury, as well as in military personnel exposed to repetitive head impacts. Finally, we discuss future directions for research that will likely lead to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms separating those who recover from repetitive brain trauma vs. those who go on to develop CTE.

AB  - Abstract Background Traumatized refugees with comorbid pain report more severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), respond less well to PTSD-focused treatments and exhibit greater disability. A mutually maintaining relationship may exist between pain and PTSD, that may be partly accounted for by depression, but no prior studies have tested this assumption in traumatized refugees. Method Self-report measures of pain, PTSD, depression, disability, pain catastrophizing (PC) and trauma-related beliefs (TRBs) were administered to 197 refugees referred to the Danish Institute Against Torture (DIGNITY) prior to treatment. The contribution of pain, depression, PC, and TRBs to the overall variance in PTSD severity was examined. We also examined whether the relationship between pain and PTSD was mediated by PC and TRBs, after controlling for depression. Results Depression, pain severity, PC and TRBs together accounted for 66% of the overall variance in PTSD, with depression being the primary contributor (57%). In univariate tests, both PC and TRBs significantly mediated the relationship between pain interference/severity and PTSD. However, after controlling for depression only PC mediated this relationship. Conclusions Negative beliefs about pain and the trauma made small, but additive contributions to the relationship between pain and PTSD severity, after controlling for depression. Longitudinal studies with refugees, involving tests of more complex mutual maintenance models, are warranted. Significance After controlling for symptoms of depression, pain catastrophizing and negative trauma-related beliefs partly mediated the relationship between pain and PTSD in tortured refugees. The results suggest that all three variables are important in a mutual mediation model of pain and PTSD, and as targets for treatment, in traumatized refugees.

AB  - Abstract Treatment techniques for psychic trauma in children are as yet at a very preliminary stage. No generally accepted research study has established one certain technique as standard. Possibilities for treatment of childhood post-traumatic stress disorders cluster into family, group, and individual treatments. Among the individual treatment modalities available, play therapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, cognitive and behavioral therapies, and medication hold the most promise. A combination of several of these treatments would, in most cases, be the best program available today.

AB  - Abstract Background? Trauma is a leading cause of death and although the gut is recognized as the ?motor? of post-traumatic systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ failure, studies on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are few. Our objectives were to create a precisely controllable tissue injury model in which GI motility, systemic inflammation and wound fluid can be analyzed. Methods? A non-narcotic murine trauma model was developed by the subcutaneous dorsal trans-implantation of a devitalized donor syngeneic harvested tissue?bone matrix (TBX), which was precisely adjusted to % total body weight and studied after 21?h. Gastrointestinal transit histograms were plotted after the oral administration of non-digestible FITC-dextran and geometric centers calculated. Organ bath evaluated jejunal circular muscle contractility. Multiplex electrochemiluminescence measurements of serum and TBX wound fluid inflammatory mediators were performed. Key Results? Increasing TBX amounts progressively delayed transit, whereas TBX heat denaturation or decellularization prevented ileus and death. In the TBX17.5% model, jejunal muscle contractility was suppressed and a systemic inflammatory response developed as significant serum elevations in IL-6, keratinocyte cytokine and IL-10 compared to sham. In addition, inflammatory responses within the wound fluid showed elevated levels of preformed IL-1? and TNF-α, whereas, 21?h after implantation IL-1?, IL-6 and keratinocyte cytokine were significantly increased in the wound. Conclusions & Inferences? A novel donor tissue?bone matrix trauma model was developed that is precisely adjustable and recapitulates important clinical phenomena. The non-narcotic model demonstrated that increasing tissue injury progressively caused ileus, initiated a systemic inflammatory response and developed inflammatory changes within the wound.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To investigate the admission characteristics and hospital outcomes for Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients admitted to intensive units (ICUs) after major trauma. Design, setting Retrospective analysis of Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) Adult Patient Database data from 92 Australian ICUs for the 6-year period, 2010?2015. Participants Patients older than 17 years of age admitted to public hospital ICUs with a primary diagnosis of trauma. Main outcome measures ICU and overall hospital lengths of stay, hospital discharge destination, and ICU and overall hospital mortality rates for Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients. Results 23 804 people were admitted to Australian public hospital ICUs after major trauma; 1754 (7.4%) were Indigenous Australians. The population-standardised incidence of admissions was consistently higher for Indigenous Australians than for non-Indigenous Australians (847 per million v 251 per million population; incidence ratio, 3.37; 95% CI, 3.19?3.57). Overall hospital mortality rates were similar for Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.82?1.31). Indigenous patients were more likely than non-Indigenous patients to be discharged to another hospital (non-Indigenous v Indigenous: aOR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72?0.96) less likely to be discharged home (non-Indigenous v Indigenous: aOR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04?1.31). Conclusion The population rate of trauma-related ICU admissions was substantially higher for Indigenous than non-Indigenous patients, but hospital mortality rates after ICU admission were similar. Indigenous patients were more likely to be discharged to a another hospital and less likely to be discharged home than non-Indigenous patients.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background There is some evidence that antisocial individuals, including young delinquents, are significantly more likely than people in the general population to incur a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Extant studies are hampered by methodological limitations, such as small sample sizes, lack of control for confounding effects, and use of single sites and may lack representativeness. Hypothesis The hypothesis for this study is that young offenders with a history of TBI will not only be at higher risk of impulsivity and negative emotionality than their non-injured peers but also that those with TBI will have had more previous victimisation experiences. Methods Data from two sites (Philadelphia, PA and Phoenix, AZ) in a substantial longitudinal, prospective study ? the Pathways to Desistance Study ? were used to compare young people (average age 16?years) who reported TBI with those who did not. Independent variables were behavioural, criminogenic and psychosocial measures. Results Male youths were about twice as likely as young females to report TBI. Such injury was associated with higher impulsivity and negative emotion ratings, even after allowing for potentially confounding factors, including sex. In addition, TBI was independently associated with self-reported experience of victimisation. Conclusions/implications This extends the generalisability of earlier suggestions of a relationship between TBI and offending, and various factors thought likely to mediate the relationship. The implications are, thus, that it is likely to be of practical value to screen young people who get into the criminal justice system for a history of TBI, and thus to allow for more specific tailoring of interventions to reduce the range of associated problems, including likely reoffending.

AB  - Summary Imaging in trauma patients has dramatically evolved since the advent of computed tomography (CT), particularly multidetector CT (MDCT) technology. Axial MDCT images of the body can be acquired in seconds and shown any plane, allowing immediate viewing and interpreting. These factors make CT an invaluable means to detect many injuries not previously visible by any other noninvasive imaging techniques. Potentially subtle, but significant, thoracic injuries such as pneumothorax, haemothorax, aortic injury, sternal and spinal fractures can be detected on MDCT easily. In this article, the author will discuss the use of MDCT in the diagnosis of various thoracic injuries.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to explore the issue of the psychological aftermaths of traumatic events in women. According to the existing body of evidence, women suffer more often than men from mental health problems as a result of a traumatic event?one of the explanations for this is that women experience sexual trauma more frequently and this type of trauma causes more severe negative consequences. Therefore, the main aim of this research was to compare the aftermaths of sexual and non-sexual traumatic events in women. Only traumatic events in adulthood were taken into consideration and were divided into two categories: recent events (previous two years) and those of an earlier occurrence. Depression and low level of self-esteem were included in the research model as possible consequences of traumatic events. A total of 273 women from Poland took part in a questionnaire survey. As hypothesized, in the case of recent events, participants who experienced a sexual trauma showed a higher level of depression and lower level of self-esteem compared with those subjects, who experienced a non-sexual trauma or did not experience a traumatic event at all. However, this effect was not observed in the case of events of earlier occurrence. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message Relations between traumatic experiences and the level of depression and self-esteem in women were demonstrated. Women who experienced sexual trauma showed higher levels of depression and lower levels of self-esteem than women who experienced other types of trauma. Time of the occurrence of the traumatic events matters: the relations between traumatic events, depression and self-esteem were demonstrated in the case of the events that occurred within the last two years.

AB  - Summary In the current study, we investigated whether suppression can produce an amplified memory for a traumatic experience. Participants viewed a distressing film depicting a multi-fatality car accident. We broke the film down into several short clips, some of which were removed. After viewing the film, we instructed participants to (i) suppress and monitor film-related thoughts, (ii) think freely and monitor film-related thoughts or (iii) just think freely. Twenty-four hours later, participants completed a recognition test. Memory distortion was comparable across conditions; however, suppression and monitoring of trauma-related thoughts removed the typical bias to falsely remember the most critical and traumatic clips of the film over the least critical clips. Our data suggest that suppression may be effective in reducing trauma-related cognitions and, therefore, does not predict a more ?amplified? memory for trauma. Instead, suppression and thought monitoring encourage an unbiased, although inaccurate, memory for trauma.Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Trauma-informed care (TIC) is a systems-focused philosophy of service delivery based upon principles of choice, collaboration, empowerment, safety and trustworthiness that recognizes the pervasive impact of trauma across the human experience. In a grassroots effort, one organization developed an innovative, trauma-informed day program to meet the needs of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) who were recently deinstitutionalized. The present study is intended to provide an initial conceptualization and preliminary assessment of TIC within IDD services in order to understand its impact among individuals and staff. The study sought to answer the following questions: Has the program's culture been stable over time? How have individuals? behaviors changed over time? What have been the experiences of the program's staff members with TIC? Through a mixed methods design, secondary data analysis and semi structured staff interviews were used to assess the impact of TIC. Findings revealed an initial strong presence of choice, collaboration, empowerment, safety, and trustworthiness within the program's culture, with non significant changes at follow-up. Significant reductions were noted in overall challenging behavior, aggression, and PRN medication usage; while non significant changes were noted in physical interventions with the exception of ?other? interventions (i.e., least restrictive) which significantly increased. Three major categories emerged from the qualitative data (making a difference, recognizing progress and compromising factors), illuminating staff satisfaction with work experiences, individuals? progress, and factors that challenged fidelity to TIC. The study provides a preliminary conceptualization and evidence for the efficacy of the integration of TIC into IDD services despite methodological limitations and concerns regarding the use of physical interventions. Directions for future research are presented.

AB  - Abstract The supine chest X ray is a standard part of early trauma assessment protocols. It is used to rapidly identify potentially life threatening chest injuries. However, latest research shows that chest ultrasound has superior accuracy when compared to supine chest X ray for diagnosing most chest injuries. Is it time we allowed ultrasound to supersede supine chest X ray as the initial investigative modality of choice for the patient with thoracic trauma?
