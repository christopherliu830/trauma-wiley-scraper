AB  - Researchers have illustrated the deleterious psychological effects that racial discrimination has exerted on Black Americans. The resulting racial stress and trauma (RST) from experiences with discrimination has been linked to negative wellness outcomes and trajectories for Black youth and families. Racial socialization (RS)?defined as the verbal and nonverbal messages that families use to communicate race to their children?can be a cultural strength and has been associated with positive outcomes in Black youth. Furthermore, the Racial Encounter Coping Appraisal and Socialization Theory (RECAST) encourages the frequent and competent use of RS between family members to cope with the negative impact of RST. Guided by RECAST, the purpose of this article is to describe the development of the Engaging, Managing, and Bonding through Race (EMBRace) intervention targeting the RS practices between Black adolescents and families. The authors explore current research on RST, discuss why traditional coping models for stress are inadequate for racially specific stressors, highlight RECAST as a burgeoning racial coping and socialization model, and describe how RS can be used as a tool to intervene within Black families. This is followed by a detailed description of the development and use of the EMBRace intervention which seeks to reduce RST through RS psychoeducation and practice, stress management, and the promotion of bonding in Black families. This article aims to serve as an example of a culturally relevant RS intervention for Black families who may benefit from clinical treatment for psychological distress from racially discriminatory encounters.

AB  - Objective The role of bacterial infection in the causation of disc degeneration and its consequences is controversial. The current evidence is limited to underpowered studies, with the majority of such studies having only an internal contaminant arm, and only one study having a control arm with a non-degenerate disc population. The Degenerate-disc Infection Study with Contaminant Control (DISC) study includes a control arm and an internal contaminant control to resolve these shortcomings. Methods The study is designed as a case-control study: cases are patients undergoing surgery for degenerated disc pathology and controls are patients undergoing surgery for non-degenerate pathology, such as trauma, scoliosis or tumor cases. Results This study is part of a multi-centric trial involving six spine centers with 15 spine surgeons contributing. The DISC study methodology, rationale and controversies are presented here. The predominant issue is how to interpret contamination. We present our algorithm for the DISC study to address this. For disc samples that are positive concurrently with positive paraspinal tissue sample, the result will be interpreted as contamination. For positive disc samples with a negative paraspinal tissue culture result, the interpretation of this result will be infection. If cultures for both disc sample and paraspinal tissue sample are negative, then the result is interpreted as non-infected. If the disc culture is negative but paraspinal tissue culture is positive, then it is treated as a contaminant. Conclusions Future large-scale studies are required with a good control arm, a contamination arm, and histopathological correlations.

AB  - Abstract Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD) and PCL-R psychopathy are critically examined regarding their application to sentencing determinations. PCL-R psychopathy is emerging in the literature as a more useful forensic diagnostic construct than APD, which appears flawed by multiple weaknesses. These include shifting diagnostic criteria, innumeracy problems, absence of symptom weighting, temporal instability, and the equivalence of some symptoms with substance abuse disorders. Additionally, APD overdiagnosis may result from inattention to issues of social context, trauma history, and symptom pervasiveness. Neither objective nor projective personality testing reliably differentiates APD. Finally, an APD diagnosis does not always indicate criminal, much less incorrigible criminal behavior. By contrast, PCL-R psychopathy results are strongly predictive of criminal behavior and violent recidivism for Caucasian males through mid-life residing in the community. Emerging research with the PCL-R regarding other important populations and contexts is promising but generalization is currently limited. ? 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract The aims of the present study were to clarify the findings of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the aging brain, and to relate the MRI findings to higher order cortical function. A total of 118 healthy aged volunteers (41 men, 77 women) underwent cranial MRI electroencephalography (EEG), Benton visual retention test (BVRT) and interview. The subjects had no past history or clinical evidence of cerebrovascular disorder, head trauma or dementia and were living at home without any difficulty. The majority of the subjects have participated in this series of studies since 1982. Using a 1.5 T superconductive MR instrument, T1-weighted, proton density and T2-weighted images were obtained. The MRI data were rated visually by regarding 12 items according to fixed criteria. T2 high signal intensity (T2HSI) lesions were found in 69.5% of subjects, the prevalence of which increased with age. T2HSI lesions were most frequently found in the basal ganglia (61.9%), followed by the thalamus (39.0%), parietal lobe (37.0%), temporal lobe (12.7%) and pons (8.5%). Among these lesions, lacunar infarction showed low signal intensity in T1-weighted images and was found in 24.6% of subjects, the prevalence also increasing with age. These findings, including brain atrophy determined according to similar criteria, were correlated closely with the subjects' age. The results of BVRT showed a close relation with T2HSI, suggesting that T2HSI may influence cognitive function. When the subjects were classified according to the presence of T2HSI, lacunar infarction and EEG abnormalities, brain atrophy was significantly milder in a group of subjects with T2HSI(-), lacunar infarction(-) and normal EEG than in the other groups. This suggests that changes seemingly representing physiological aging may be promoted by another pathological which also exerts influences on higher order cerebral function.

AB  - Abstract Spinal implants are made from a variety of materials to meet the unique mechanical demands of each application. However, the medical device community has raised concern about mixing dissimilar metals in an implant because of fear of inducing corrosion. There is a lack of systematic studies on the effects of mixing metals on performance of spinal implants, especially in fretting corrosion conditions. Hence, the goal was to determine whether mixing stainless steel (SS316L), titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) and cobalt chromium (CoCrMo) alloy components in a spinal implant leads to any increased risk of corrosion degradation. Spinal constructs consisting of single assembly screw-connector-rod components were tested using a novel short-term cyclic fretting corrosion test method. A total of 17 alloy component combinations (comprised of SS316L, Ti6Al4V-anodized and CoCrMo alloy for rod, screws and connectors) were tested under three anatomic orientations. Spinal constructs having all SS316L were most susceptible to fretting-initiated crevice corrosion attack and showed higher average fretting currents (?25???30 µA), whereas constructs containing all Ti6Al4V components were less susceptible to fretting corrosion with average fretting currents in the range of 1???6 µA. Mixed groups showed evidence of fretting corrosion but they were not as severe as all SS316L group. SEM results showed evidence of severe corrosion attack in constructs having SS316L components. There also did not appear to be any galvanic effects of combining alloys together. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part B: Appl Biomater, 105B: 1169?1177, 2017.

AB  - Scand J Caring Sci; 2010; 24; 266?273 ? Being first on the scene of an accident ? experiences of ?doing? prehospital emergency care Prehospital emergency care includes the care and treatment of patients prior to them reaching hospital. This is generally a field for the ambulance services, but in many cases firemen or police can be the ones to provide the first responses. The aim of this study was to describe and understand experiences of being the first responder on the scene of an accident, as described by policemen, firemen and ambulance staff. A lifeworld perspective was used in four different traumatic situations from southern Sweden. The data consisted of 13 unstructured interviews with first responders. The phenomenological analysis showed that experiences of being the first responder on the scene of an accident is expectations of doing a systematic course of action, dressed in the role of a hero, and at the same time being genuine in an interpersonal encounter. This entails a continuous movement between ?being? and ?doing?. It is not a question of either ? or, instead everything is to be understood in relation to each other at the same time. Five constituents further described the variations of the phenomenon; a feeling of security in the uncertainty, a distanced closeness to the injured person, one moment in an eternity, cross-border cooperation within distinct borders and a need to make the implicit explicit. This finding highlights the importance of using policemen and firemen in doing life support measures while waiting for the ambulance staff, and would in turn increase the importance of the relationship between the different professionals on the scene of an accident.

AB  - In recent years, many urban areas have established healthcare coalitions (HCCs) composed of autonomous (and often competing) hospitals, with the goal of improving emergency preparedness and response. We study the role of such coalitions in the specific context of response to multiple-casualty incidents in an urban setting, where on-scene responders must determine how to send casualties to medical facilities. A key function in incident response is multi-agency coordination. When this coordination is provided by an HCC, responders can use richer information about hospital capacities to decide where to send casualties. Using bed availability data from an urban area and a suburban area in the United States, we analyze the response capability of healthcare infrastructures under different levels of coordination, and we develop a stress test to identify areas of weakness. We find that improved coordination efforts should focus on decision support using information about inpatient resources, especially in urban areas with high inter-hospital variability in resource availability. We also find that coordination has the largest benefit in small incidents. This benefit is a new value proposition for HCCs, which were originally formed to improve preparedness for large disasters.

AB  - Abstract: The ?considerations? addressed in this section consist of a number of thought-provoking issues and unresolved questions that emerge from the papers in this volume. The evidence for tamoxifen carcinogenicity in animal models and, to a more restricted extent, in humans has led some investigators to question whether SERMs are ready or appropriate for clinical testing?specifically, in a disease prevention setting involving healthy but high-risk individuals. There is, however, inconsistency in both efficacy and toxicity?specifically, carcinogenicity?between animal models and humans, leading others to question the value of basing the decision to proceed with clinical studies on preclinical results in animals. Although the molecular basis for SERM action is rapidly being clarified, the cellular activity of these agents is still elusive. We discuss the view that the efficacy of tamoxifen in breast cancer is based on its treatment of ?occult cancers,? or small collections of cancer cells that are not clinically apparent, not only in the context of prevention but also in the treatment setting. As part of our approach that assumes estrogen activity to be the foundation upon which SERM development is being modeled, we discuss the inconsistency between the epidemiologic data and prospective randomized data with respect to the relationship between estrogen use and cardiovascular disease. The need to validate surrogate markers of SERM action is discussed in relation to bone but is clearly relevant to all disease sites. The semantics used in describing SERM action as agonistic or antagonistic in relation to estrogen at various target sites has been inconsistent, especially in the clinical context. We attempt to dissect out some of the inconsistencies in semantics in the hope that this will contribute to improved communication of data resulting from SERM research. In the clinical arena, we begin with the premise that the large, simple randomized trial offers the optimal design for the testing of SERMs. In view of limited resources, however, we counter this position with alternative, if less desirable, approaches to the clinical format for SERM testing. Finally, we explore the process by which statistically meaningful results from clinical trials are extrapolated into the specific drug indications that apply to clinical practice.

AB  - ABSTRACT The main function of adipose tissue has been considered as storage of triglycerides. Adipose tissue was considered harmful for healing extensive and deep burns because of poor circulation and easy liquefaction in wound beds, which offer an excellent culture medium for bacteria. However, these traditional concepts have been challenged with the discovery of the endocrine function of adipose tissue. To investigate the effects of adipose tissue extract on wound healing, we created four 3.0 ? 2.5?cm full-thickness wounds on each side of the back of male Wu Zhi Shan minipigs (n=6), for eight wounds in each animal. The wounds were randomly divided to receive normal saline (0.5?mL; controls), adipose tissue extract (1.5?g), basic fibroblast growth factor (50?U/cm2), and epidermal growth factor (50?U/cm2). Reduction in wound area and wound volume was accelerated with adipose tissue treatment as compared with growth factor or control treatment. The thickness of the regenerated epidermis and the number of new vascular nets were markedly increased in adipose tissue-treated wounds. Biopsy of adipose tissue-treated wounds showed enhanced expression of proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Factor VIII-related antigen, which indicated active cell differentiation and proliferation. In vitro study in rat tissue showed adipose tissue extracts stimulating skin growth. Bacteriology results showed no significant differences in amount or type of bacteria, whatever the treatment. These results may challenge the traditional concept that adipose tissue plays a negative role in wound healing and may offer direct evidence for encouraging the retention of adipose tissue in autologous skin grafting for skin wounds.

AB  - Objective To investigate the in vitro efficacy of commercially available topical otic preparations (?ear cleaners?) against Pseudomonas spp. isolated from canine ear infections. Methods Between January and May 2011, 50 isolates that were morphologically and phenotypically confirmed as Pseudomonas spp. were isolated from 48 dogs that had been identified with clinical signs of otitis externa and media at a referral dermatology clinic in the north west of the UK. The in vitro efficacy of eight different topical preparations against these isolates was investigated using an in-agar inhibition test. Results Of the eight preparations tested, three showed consistently good in vitro activity against Pseudomonas spp., while a further three were consistently ineffective. For the remaining two -preparations, in vitro efficacy was variable and inconsistent. Clinical Significance Topical treatment with ear cleaners is considered to be a valuable adjunct in the treatment of canine otitis that involves multi-antimicrobial-resistant organisms such as Pseudomonas spp. Where treatment with antimicrobials is not an option, the use of these preparations, as a sole form of therapy, may be effective in some cases. As a comparison with other similar studies looking at the activity of ear cleaners against bacterial isolates from otitis, this study uses isolates from 50 ears from 48 dogs providing a significant number of isolates for analysis.

AB  - Hurricane Katrina of August 2005 forced more than one million people to evacuate the Gulf Coast of the United States. This study examines the psychological health and well-being of a subset of evacuees to determine the prevalence of ongoing mental health problems. Interviews were conducted with 101 adults who evacuated to Louisville, Kentucky, and were living in the state at the one-year anniversary of the event or had recently returned to the Gulf Coast. The psychological health and well-being of respondents was evaluated using several well-validated measures. More than one-half met the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder and a majority were suffering from depression and anxiety. The mean quality of life score was 0.6 on a scale from 0?1, suggesting that adaptation and return to pre-hurricane well-being had not occurred 12 months after the storm. The potential for long-term psychological damage exists in this sample of Hurricane Katrina evacuees. Results suggest other evacuees may also be at heightened risk.

AB  - Abstract The National Vietnam Veterans Longitudinal Study (NVVLS) is the second assessment of a representative cohort of US veterans who served during the Vietnam War era, either in Vietnam or elsewhere. The cohort was initially surveyed in the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study (NVVRS) from 1984 to 1988 to assess the prevalence, incidence, and effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other post-war problems. The NVVLS sought to re-interview the cohort to assess the long-term course of PTSD. NVVLS data collection began July 3, 2012 and ended May 17, 2013, comprising three components: a mailed health questionnaire, a telephone health survey interview, and, for a probability sample of theater Veterans, a clinical diagnostic telephone interview administered by licensed psychologists. Excluding decedents, 78.8% completed the questionnaire and/or telephone survey, and 55.0% of selected living veterans participated in the clinical interview. This report provides a description of the NVVLS design and methods. Together, the NVVRS and NVVLS constitute a nationally representative longitudinal study of Vietnam veterans, and extend the NVVRS as a critical resource for scientific and policy analyses for Vietnam veterans, with policy relevance for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans.

AB  - Aim To evaluate the role of tobacco use in the development of psychosis in individuals at clinical high risk. Method The North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study is a 2-year multi-site prospective case control study of persons at clinical high risk that aims to better understand predictors and mechanisms for the development of psychosis. The cohort consisted of 764 clinical high risk and 279 healthy comparison subjects. Clinical assessments included tobacco and substance use and several risk factors associated with smoking in general population studies. Results Clinical high risk subjects were more likely to smoke cigarettes than unaffected subjects (light smoking odds ratio [OR]?=?3.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]?=?1.9-5; heavy smoking OR?=?4.8, 95% CI?=?1.7-13.7). In both groups, smoking was associated with mood, substance use, stress and perceived discrimination and in clinical high risk subjects with childhood emotional neglect and adaption to school. Clinical high risk subjects reported higher rates of several factors previously associated with smoking, including substance use, anxiety, trauma and perceived discrimination. After controlling for these potential factors, the relationship between clinical high risk state and smoking was no longer significant (light smoking OR?=?0.9, 95% CI?=?0.4-2.2; heavy smoking OR?=?0.3, 95% CI?=?0.05-2.3). Moreover, baseline smoking status (hazard ratio [HR]?=?1.16, 95% CI?=?0.82-1.65) and categorization as ever smoked (HR?=?1.3, 95% CI?=?0.8-2.1) did not predict time to conversion. Conclusion Persons at high risk for psychosis are more likely to smoke and have more factors associated with smoking than controls. Smoking status in clinical high risk subjects does not predict conversion. These findings do not support a causal relationship between smoking and psychosis.

AB  - Summary Computed tomography (CT) changed radically with the advent of Multi Slice CT (MSCT) which enabled necessary technical improvements for the study of blood vessels, particularly arteries. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) has some advantages when compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). MSCT scanners are widely available in places such as emergency rooms and research centers for the diagnosis and research of stroke. Arterial venous malformations, blunt vascular trauma, aneurysms and several other diseases can also be studied with CTA. Since the early 1990's there has been a considerable increase in the number of publications regarding CTA and its widespread use makes it an essential tool in the radiologist's armamentarium.

AB  - Objective? To evaluate the in vitro efficacy of polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB)-impregnated gauze dressing in limiting the growth of bacteria both within and underneath the dressing. Study Design? In vitro study. Methods? Squares of PHMB-impregnated and control gauze were placed on agar plates inoculated with 1 of 11 bacterial species, including 8 multi-resistant organisms. Growth under the gauze was assessed qualitatively after 24-hour incubation. Repeated use of sponges was used to evaluate residual inhibitory activity against Micrococcus lutea and Staphylococcus schleiferi ss. schleiferi. In a second procedure, PHMB-impregnated and control gauze squares were placed in sterile plastic wells and inoculated with 1 of 5 bacterial species, including Pseudomonas spp. and Klebsiella spp. Inhibition of bacterial growth within and underneath the dressing after 24-hour incubation was evaluated by quantifying the numbers of bacteria on the well floor and within each square. Results? PHMB-impregnated gauze provided greater inhibition of growth of 4/4 Gram-positive species and 2/6 Gram-negative species on inoculated plates compared with control gauze. Residual inhibitory activity of PHMB-impregnated gauze was significantly greater against M. lutea on all days and against S. schleiferi ss. schleiferi on days 1 and 4 compared with control. No bacteria were recovered from inoculated PHMB-impregnated gauze squares placed in sterile wells or from the well floor underneath. More than 9 ? 105 colony-forming units (CFU) were recovered from inoculated control samples placed in sterile wells and more than 8.4 ? 104 CFU were recovered from control well floors. Conclusion? PHMB-impregnated gauze dressing, when placed on inoculated agar plates, reduces growth of underlying bacteria, particularly Gram-positive species. Wet-inoculated PHMB-impregnated dressing prevents growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria both within and underneath the dressing. Clinical Relevance? PHMB-impregnated dressings may be useful for reducing contamination of underlying wounds by bacterial pathogens.

AB  - Abstract Genetic testing for BRCA1/2 has psychosocial impacts including those related to views of personal health, sense of self and identity and body image. The centrality of a person's self-concept in maintaining physical and psychosocial well-being has been well recognized; however, to date research exploring altered self-concept related to carrier knowledge is limited. Objective: The objective of the study was to develop and validate a scale to measure the self-concept among individuals testing positive for BRCA1/2 mutations. Methods: The study was conducted in two phases: phase I: item generation and refinement and phase II: scale selection and initial validation. During phase I, scale items were generated through individual interviews and focus groups of women with BRCA1/2 mutations, including women with or without a prior diagnosis of cancer. In phase II items were selected based on several criteria resulting in a 25-item scale, which underwent a reliability analyses and preliminary validation with 115 women. A second sample of 126 women was used to conduct further validation and samples were pooled to conduct factor analysis and the final scale selection. Results: A 17-item self-concept scale emerged having three factors: stigma, vulnerability and mastery demonstrating evidence for an instrument with promising psychometric properties (total scale alpha=0.90). Conclusions: The scale has direct relevance for research in facilitating our understanding of the specific aspects of the self, which are vulnerable to BRCA1/2 testing and which play a role in clinical outcomes, to facilitate the development and specific testing of interventions and may be used as an outcome measure. Specific measurement tools for genetic populations will ultimately assist in the clinical management of these populations. Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The Australian and New Zealand Haemostasis Registry (ANZHR) included patients who received off-licence recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) for critical bleeding from 2000 to 2009. Approximately 1.3% of the ANZHR patients were Jehovah's Witnesses (JWs). We compared them with the non-JW patients in the registry. Methods Patient characteristics (e.g. gender, context of bleeding), factors influencing rFVIIa use (e.g. body temperature and pH) and outcomes (e.g. bleeding response (stopped/attenuated or unchanged) to rFVIIa, mortality) were compared between JW and non-JW patients using Fisher's exact chi-square tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results A total of 42 JW and 3134 non-JW patients were included in the analysis. Approximately 99% (n = 3098) of non-JWs received blood products compared with only 30% (n = 13) of JWs (P < 0.01). The distribution of gender and contexts of critical bleeding in the two groups was significantly different. Approximately 17% of the non-JW patients were hypothermic (T < 35°C) and about 19% were acidotic (pH < 7.2) at the time of initial rFVIIa administration. Conversely, none of the JWs were hypothermic and only one was acidotic. The proportion of positive responders to rFVIIa (stopped/attenuated bleeding following rFVIIa use) was similar in both groups (75% non-JWs, 74% JWs; P = 1.0). Approximately 28% of non-JW and 17% of JW patients were deceased by day 28 following rFVIIa use (P = 0.16). Discussion Several factors were observed to be significantly different between JW and non-JW patients, yet the proportions of responders to rFVIIa were similar in both groups. The actual factors influencing response to rFVIIa are yet to be determined.
