AB  - Abstract Introduction The Australian and New Zealand Haemostasis Registry (ANZHR) included patients who received off-licence recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) for critical bleeding from 2000 to 2009. Approximately 1.3% of the ANZHR patients were Jehovah's Witnesses (JWs). We compared them with the non-JW patients in the registry. Methods Patient characteristics (e.g. gender, context of bleeding), factors influencing rFVIIa use (e.g. body temperature and pH) and outcomes (e.g. bleeding response (stopped/attenuated or unchanged) to rFVIIa, mortality) were compared between JW and non-JW patients using Fisher's exact chi-square tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results A total of 42 JW and 3134 non-JW patients were included in the analysis. Approximately 99% (n = 3098) of non-JWs received blood products compared with only 30% (n = 13) of JWs (P < 0.01). The distribution of gender and contexts of critical bleeding in the two groups was significantly different. Approximately 17% of the non-JW patients were hypothermic (T < 35°C) and about 19% were acidotic (pH < 7.2) at the time of initial rFVIIa administration. Conversely, none of the JWs were hypothermic and only one was acidotic. The proportion of positive responders to rFVIIa (stopped/attenuated bleeding following rFVIIa use) was similar in both groups (75% non-JWs, 74% JWs; P = 1.0). Approximately 28% of non-JW and 17% of JW patients were deceased by day 28 following rFVIIa use (P = 0.16). Discussion Several factors were observed to be significantly different between JW and non-JW patients, yet the proportions of responders to rFVIIa were similar in both groups. The actual factors influencing response to rFVIIa are yet to be determined.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is an uncommon but important cause of sudden-onset headache. Three clinical decision rules (CDRs) for investigation in sudden headache have been proposed, but concerns were raised about the generalisability of some variables. Our aim was to determine what proportion of patients with confirmed SAH has the identified high-risk factors and the sensitivity of the proposed CDR in an Australasian cohort. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of alert and neurologically intact adult patients with confirmed SAH attending two community teaching hospitals between 2000 and 2011. The outcomes of interest were the proportion of patients with each high-risk criterion (descriptive statistics) and sensitivity of each proposed CDR (%, interquartile range [IQR]). Results There were 59 confirmed SAH that met the inclusion criteria. Sensitivity of proposed CDR 1 was 96.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 88.5?99.1%), sensitivity of proposed CDR 2 was 100% (95% CI 93.9?100%) and sensitivity of proposed CDR 3 was 89.8% (95% CI 79.5?95.3%). The addition of vomiting to the criteria in CDRs 1 and 3 increased the sensitivity of both these CDRs to 100%. Conclusion CDR 2, or the refinement of CDRs 1 and 3 with the inclusion of at least one episode of vomiting as a criterion, has very high sensitivity. Although unlikely to reduce CT scan rates for patients in whom there is a clinical suspicion of SAH, they might be useful in guiding which patients require further testing (e.g. lumbar puncture) after a negative CT scan.

AB  - Using data from the 2011 British Social Attitudes survey (n?=?3,311), this article compares British public opinion of the purposes and successes of the Iraq and Afghanistan missions. Public acceptance of military deaths/injuries, the accuracy of public estimates of military fatalities and how these differ according to opinions of the missions are determined. It is found that the British public is doubtful of the missions' achievements and cynical about their purposes. Perceptions of the campaigns were associated with the accuracy of estimations of UK military fatalities, and the acceptability of military deaths/injuries. Implications for social and political theory and British foreign policy are discussed.

AB  - Circumstantial evidence based on anecdote, case reports, epidemiological data and studies in vitro and in situ implicate tooth brushing with toothpaste with tooth wear, gingival recession and dentine hypersensitivity. This review attempts to assess the clinical significance of the potential harm produced by this most common oral hygiene habit. The toothbrush alone appears to have no effect on enamel and very little on dentine. Most toothpaste also has very little effect on enamel and in normal use would not cause significant wear of dentine in a lifetime of use. Wear of enamel and dentine can be dramatically increased if tooth brushing follows an erosive challenge. Gingival recession has a multi-factorial aetiology and certain individuals and specific teeth may be predisposed to trauma from tooth brushing. Tooth brushing is known to cause gingival abrasions but how these relate to gingival recession is not known. The role of toothpaste in gingival abrasion and recession surprisingly has received little if any attention. Gingival recession most commonly exposes dentine and localises sites for dentine hypersensitivity. Some toothpaste products can expose dentinal tubules but erosion is probably the more dominant factor in dentine hypersensitivity. There is no evidence to indicate that electric and manual toothbrushes differ in effects on soft and hard tissues. It is only under, over or abusive use or when combined with erosion that significant harm may be thus caused. In normal use it must be concluded that the benefits of tooth brushing far out-way the potential harm.

AB  - Abstract Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease characterized by the presence of non-caseating granulomas. Its etiology remains obscure. A plausible hypothesis suggests that a complex interplay of host factors, infectious processes, and non-infectious environmental factors, matched with a susceptible genetic background, results in a pathway that leads to systemic granulomatous inflammation. Although presentations of sarcoidosis vary enormously, multi-organ involvement is a common feature. Cutaneous involvement occurs in about 25% of patients with protean manifestations and variable prognoses. Skin manifestations are divided into specific lesions with histopathologically evident non-caseating granulomas and nonspecific lesions arising from a reactive process that does not form granulomas. A peculiar form of cutaneous sarcoidosis is represented by sarcoidal lesions at sites of trauma that has caused scarring. The pathogenesis of scar sarcoidosis remains unknown. Scar sarcoidosis is also associated with herpes zoster infection, surgery, and tattooing. Such heterogeneous events, along with those at the sites of chronic lymphedema, thermal burns, radiation dermatitis, and vaccinations, occur on areas of vulnerable skin labeled ?immunocompromised districts?. Numerous options are available for the treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis. Although corticosteroids remain the treatment of choice for initial systemic therapy, other nonsteroidal agents have proven effective and therefore useful for long-term management. Tumor necrosis factor-α antagonists such as infliximab may have a role in the treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis, especially in refractory cases that are resistant to standard regimens. Elucidation of the relationship of sarcoidal granulomas with malignancy and immunity may facilitate a better understanding of some pathomechanisms operating in neoplastic and immunity-related disorders.

AB  - ABSTRACT Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of human suffering and disability for which disease-modifying treatments are lacking. OA occurs through complex and dynamic interplays between diverse factors over long periods of time. The traditional research and clinical focus on OA, the end stage disease, obscured understanding pathogenesis prior to reaching a common pathway defined by pain and functional deficits, joint deformity, and radiographic changes. To emphasize disease modification and prevention, we describe a multi-disciplinary systems-based approach encompassing biology, mechanics, and structure to define pre-osteoarthritic disease processes. Central to application of this model is the concept of ?pre-osteoarthritis,? conditions where clinical OA has not yet developed. Rather, joint homeostasis has been compromised and there are potentially reversible markers for heightened OA risk. Key messages from this perspective are (i) to focus research onto defining pre-OA through identifying and validating biological, mechanical, and imaging markers of OA risk, (ii) to emphasize multi-disciplinary approaches, and (iii) to propose that developing personalized interventions to address reversible markers of OA risk in healthy joints may be the key to prevention. Ultimately, a systems-based analysis of OA pathogenesis shows potential to transform clinical practice by facilitating development and testing of new strategies to prevent or delay the onset of osteoarthritis. ? 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Summary Endocrine causes of hypertensive emergencies are easily overlooked when patients present with uncontrolled hypertension in association with evidence of end-organ damage. Emergencies arising from hypertensive crises due to pheochromocytoma can be particularly dangerous. To ensure appropriate therapeutic counter-measures and a favorable outcome, the presence of a catecholamine-producing tumor should be distinguished from more common etiologies as well as other uncommon endocrine causes, such as primary hyperaldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, and thyrotoxicosis. However, diagnosis at the time of the emergency can be made difficult by activation of the sympathoadrenal system resulting from the physiological stress of the clinical condition. Tests of catecholamine excess are therefore rendered problematic to interpret, with reliable diagnosis often only possible once and if the patient recovers. Because of this and time delays in obtaining test results, recognition of a possible endocrine cause in the emergency setting requires careful attention to patient history, presentation, and precipitating causes that may provide clues to underlying etiologies to guide therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Abstract Neurotrauma, as in the case of traumatic brain injury, promotes protease over-activation characterized by the select fragmentation of brain proteins. The resulting polypeptides are indicators of biochemical processes, which can be used to study post-injury dynamics and may also be developed into biomarkers. To this end, we devised a novel mass spectrometry approach to characterize post-injury calpain proteolytic processing of myelin basic protein (MBP), a biomarker of brain injury that denotes white matter damage and recovery. Our approach exceeds conventional immunological assays in its deconvolution of multiple protein isoforms, its absolute quantification of proteolytic fragments and its polypeptide selectivity. We quantified and characterized post-injury proteolytic processing of all MBP isoforms identified in adult rat cortex. Further, the translation of calpain-cleaved MBP into CSF was verified following brain injury. We ascertained that the exon-6 sequence of MBP resulted in a characteristic shift in gel migration for intact and fragmented protein alike. We also found evidence for a second post-TBI cleavage event within exon-2 and for the dimerization of the post-TBI 4.3?kDa fragment. Ultimately, the novel methodology described here can be used to study MBP dynamics and other similar proteolytic events of relevance to brain injury and other CNS processes.

However, no randomised, controlled or double-blinded studies on the efficacy of this treatment in horses have been reported to date. Objective: To investigate the effects of a unique LPPC (Biolane)1 in improving clinical signs of OA in the fetlock. Methods: Data were analysed from 26 horses with primary fetlock lameness in a controlled, randomised and double-blinded, multi-centre clinical trial. The study design was a partial crossover with a washout period and consisted of 19 horses treated with LPPC and 20 with a placebo. Horses were dosed orally with 25?mg/kg bwt/day LPPC or placebo for 56 days. Efficacy was evaluated by clinical assessment of lameness, passive flexion, pain, swelling and heat in the affected joint. Relationships between variables were analysed using an ordinal logistic model with random effects for horse and horse x treatment according to a modified intention-to-treat analysis. Results: Clinical evaluation of horses with a fetlock lameness treated with LPPC showed a significant reduction in severity of lameness (P<0.001), improved response to the joint flexion test (P<0.001) and reduced joint pain (P = 0.014) when compared with horses treated with placebo. Conclusions: The LPPC significantly alleviated the severity of lameness and joint pain and improved response to joint flexion in horses with lameness attributable to OA in the fetlock.

AB  - Objective To compare the biomechanical properties of single- and two-segment fusion for Denis type B spinal fracture. Methods Two female patients with Denis type B L1 vertebral fractures were studied. Both patients had achieved intervertebral fusion by 1 year postoperatively, at which time CT data were collected, including data of one patient before and after removal of pedicle screws and of another whose pedicle screws were not removed. The data were imported into Mimics software and T11-L2 three dimensional models established. After construction of the models, they were imported into ANSYS software. An axial load (260?N) and 10?Nm torque were loaded to simulate the flexion, extension, lateral bending and rotation of the spine, respectively. Results There was no significant difference in the average displacement of the spine motion between the two-segment and single-segment fusion patients without removal of pedicle screws. However, for all motion forms, the average displacement of the single-segment fusion patient' spine after removal of pedicle screws was significantly greater than that before removal of pedicle screws and that of the two-segment fusion patient. The average Von Mises stress of T11?12 intervertebral disc of two-segment fusion patient was significantly greater than that of the one-segment fusion patient. Moreover, the average Von Mises stress of T11?12 intervertebral disc of single-segment fusion patient was greater before than after removal of pedicle screws. Conclusion Provided there is satisfactory interbody fusion, removal of pedicle screws after one-segment fusion can increase spinal motion, reduce the stress on adjacent intervertebral discs and delay disc degeneration.

AB  - Summary The conscious experience of pain defies precise anatomic, physiologic, and/or pharmacologic definition; furthermore, it can be experienced even in the absence of obvious external noxious stimulation, and it can be modified by behavioral experiences including fear, memory, and stress. Nociception is the neural process of encoding noxious stimuli, the consequences of which may be behavioral - either a simple motor withdrawal reflex or more complex avoidance behaviors - or autonomic. Two main approaches have been adopted when studying pain in animals. The first approach is to study responses to brief noxious stimuli in naive animals. The second approach is to induce pain in the animal by delivery of a tonic, sustained noxious stimulus that induces peripheral or central sensitization and subsequently to study pain mechanisms and test analgesic drugs. Phasic pain tests, analgesic testing, local anesthetics, pharmacologic treatment of pain, pain assays, N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids are also discussed.

AB  - Objective To report outcomes in dogs with distal radial osteosarcoma (OSA) treated with metal endoprosthesis limb-sparing surgery and compare outcomes between 2 generations of endoprosthesis. Study Design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Forty-five dogs with distal radial OSA treated with endoprosthesis and chemotherapy. Methods Data of dogs treated with either first-generation endoprosthesis (GEN1) or second-generation endoprosthesis (GEN2) were sourced from medical records and radiographs. Surgical outcomes included postoperative lameness assessment and the presence, severity, and time to onset of complications. Oncologic outcomes included presence of local recurrence or metastasis, time to onset of local recurrence, metastasis-free interval (MFI), and survival time. Results for surgical and oncologic outcomes were compared between GEN1 and GEN2. Results Twenty-eight dogs received GEN1 and 17 dogs received GEN2. There were 39 complications (96%, 14 minor, 29 major) including infection (78%), implant-related complication (36%), and local recurrence (24%). Metastatic frequency was 67% and median MFI was 188 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 126?250 days). Survival time ranged from 34 days to 6.1 years with a median of 289 days (95% CI: 207?371 days). There was no significant difference in complication severity, frequency, time to complication, MFI, or survival time between dogs receiving GEN1 and GEN2. Conclusion There was no significant difference in outcomes between dogs receiving GEN1 and GEN2 for limb-sparing surgery of the radius. Metastatic frequency and survival time for metal endoprosthesis were similar to that of amputation with curative intent chemotherapy.

Our aim was to investigate immune responses to gluten and gliadin in children affected by coeliac disease by performing APTs, and to compare these data to the ones observed in AD patients. 31 children, 15 males and 16 females (mean age?±?s.d.?=?5,5?±?3,8 years) affected by coeliac disease underwent APTs with gluten and gliadin. Among these, 15 children were on gluten-free diet at the moment of our examination and 3 patients were affected by AD. 83 AD children not affected by celiac disease, were used as controls. 19,4% and 12,9% of children with coeliac disease proved positive to APTs with gluten and gliadin, respectively. No difference in the frequency and intensity of APT responses were present between the patients on gluten-free diet and the children not on diet. Among AD patients 12% reacted to gluten, whereas no positive reactions to gliadin were observed. Going on these findings, the cellular-mediated reactivity to gliadin in patients with coeliac disease may show a clinical expression by positive APT reactions to gliadin. These represent a specific finding in subjects with coeliac disease when compared to AD children.

AB  - Objectives To assess the prevalence of antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum in a population of dogs with a diagnosis of suspected inflammatory meningoencephalitis. Materials and Methods Medical records of three referral centres were reviewed from 2008 to 2016 to identify a cohort of dogs diagnosed and treated for suspected inflammatory meningoencephalitis after testing for evidence of exposure to these pathogens. Results In our sample of 400 dogs the prevalence for exposure (IgG>1:50) to Toxoplasma gondii was 8/201 (3∙98%). Active infection (IgG titre >1:400 or/and an IgM titre >1:64 and/or positive PCR in CSF) was suspected in 1/400 (0∙25%). The prevalence for exposure [Indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) titre >1:50] and active infection (IFA titres ≥?1:400 and/or positive PCR in CSF) with Neospora caninum were 14/201 (6∙96%) and 9/400 (2∙25%), respectively. Clinical Significance In view of the low prevalence of protozoan infections, the risk associated with starting immunosuppressive medication in dogs with evidence of inflammatory meningitis or encephalitis in the UK appears low.

AB  - Summary Paragangliomas (phaeochromocytomas) can present with life-threatening catecholamine-induced crises: hypertensive crisis; atrial and ventricular arrhythmias; hypotensive crisis; and multi-organ crisis. Crises may be triggered by administration of drugs, such as dopamine antagonists, or anaesthetic agents. Manipulation of the tumour is likely to trigger a crisis in a patient without sufficient alpha-adrenergic blockade and exclusion of catecholamine excess is necessary prior to surgery on any tumour located at a site typical for paragangliomas. Dedicated cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) of the adrenal glands should be undertaken to localize the tumour. Alpha blockade using phenoxybenzamine at an initial dose of 10mg 12-hourly PO should be initiated once the diagnosis is confirmed. This carries a risk of inducing profound hypotension and is best undertaken as an inpatient. Beta blockade to control tachycardia or tachyarrhythmia may safely be commenced once adequate alpha blockade is in place.

AB  - Abstract Teamwork has become a major focus in healthcare. In part, this is the result of the Institute of Medicine report entitled To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System, which details the high rate of preventable medical errors, many of which are the result of dysfunctional or nonexistent teamwork. It has been proposed that a healthcare system that supports effective teamwork can improve the quality of patient care and reduce workload issues that cause burnout among healthcare professionals. Few clear guidelines exist to help guide the implementation of all these recommendations in healthcare settings. In general, training programs designed to improve team skills are a new concept for medicine, particularly for physicians who are trained largely to be self-sufficient and individually responsible for their actions. Outside of healthcare, research has shown that teams working together in high-risk and high-intensity work environments make fewer mistakes than individuals. This evidence originates from commercial aviation, the military, firefighting, and rapid-response police activities. Commercial aviation, an industry in which mistakes can result in unacceptable loss, has been at the forefront of risk reduction through teamwork training. The importance of teamwork has been recognized by some in the healthcare industry who have begun to develop their own specialty-driven programs. The purpose of this review is to discuss the current literature on teaching about teamwork in undergraduate medical education. We describe the science of teams, analyze the work in team training that has been done in other fields, and assess what work has been done in other fields about the importance of team training (ie, aviation, nonmedical education, and business). Additionally, it is vital to assess what work has already been done in medicine to advance the skills required for effective teamwork. Much of this work has been done in fields in which medical professionals deal with crisis situations (ie, anesthesia, trauma, and labor and delivery). We describe the current programs for teaching medical students these essential skills and what recommendations have been made about the best ways to introduce teaching this skill set into the curriculum. Finally, we include a review on assessing teamwork because one cannot teach team training without implementing an assessment to ensure that the skills are being learned.

AB  - Abstract Background: Ultrastructural findings of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) include myocyte atrophy and myofilament loss, yet little is known about the vascular abnormalities present in IDCM. Methods and results: Patients with IDCM and controls underwent multi-slice CT to examine length and diameter of epicardial vasculature. The levels of mobilizing cytokines and circulating EPCs were assessed by endothelial colony formation assay and flow cytometry. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to examine microvessel density and expression of HIF-1α and ?-catenin. Main epicardial coronary arteries were shorter and smaller, and microvascular density was reduced in the epicardium in IDCM. Epicardial vessel paucity was associated with increased numbers of HIF-1α+ cells (46.8±13.1% vs. 19.4±9.4%, p=0.006) indicating local epicardial hypoxia and elevation of circulating VEGF-A (394pg/mL vs. 22pg/mL, p=0.001). The number of mobilized progenitors CD133+/VEGF-R2+ was 21-fold higher in IDCM compared with controls (6.5±3.3% vs. 0.3±0.2%; p<0.001). Moreover, this defective vascularization was associated with reduced myocardial expression of vascular ?-catenin, an important angiogenic regulator. Conclusions: This study shows defective vascularization and impaired vasculogenesis (the de novo vascular organization of mobilized endothelial progenitors) and angiogenesis (by which new blood vessels are formed from pre-existing mature endothelial cells) in human IDCM.
