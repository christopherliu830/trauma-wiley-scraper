AB  - Summary Evidence for Iron Age funerary treatments remains sporadic across Britain and formal cemeteries are especially elusive. One important exception is Broxmouth hillfort, East Lothian, excavated during the late 1970s but not yet published. New analysis of the human remains from Broxmouth provides evidence for three distinct populations: a formal cemetery outside the hillfort, isolated graves within the ramparts, and a scatter of disarticulated fragments from a range of domestic and midden contexts. The latter group in particular provides significant evidence for violent trauma; isotopic evidence suggests that they may be the remains of outsiders. Together the human remains shed light on complex and changing attitudes to death and the human body in Iron Age Britain. The material from Broxmouth is considered in the light of emerging evidence for fluid and pluralistic treatments of the dead in the Iron Age of south-east Scotland.

AB  - Allergic contact dermatitis results from a T-cell-mediated, delayed-type hypersensitivity immune response induced by allergens. Skin dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in the initiation of allergic skin responses. Following encounter with an allergen, DCs become activated and undergo maturation and differentiate into immunostimulatory DCs and are able to present antigens effectively to T cells. The frequency of allergic skin disorders has increased in the past decades. Therefore, the identification of potential sensitizing chemicals is important for skin safety. Traditionally, predictive testing for allergenicity has been conducted in animal models. For regulatory reasons, animal use for sensitization testing of compounds for cosmetic purposes is shortly to be prohibited in Europe. Therefore, new non-animal-based test methods need to be developed. Several DC-based assays have been described to discriminate allergens from irritants. Unfortunately, current in vitro methods are not sufficiently resilient to identify allergens and therefore need refinement. Here, we review the immunobiology of skin DCs (Langerhans? cells and dermal dendritic cells) and their role in allergic and irritant contact dermatitis and then explore the possible use of DC-based models for discriminating between allergens and irritants.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The objective was to critically appraise and highlight medical education research published in 2012 that was methodologically superior and whose outcomes were pertinent to teaching and education in emergency medicine (EM). Methods A search of the English language literature in 2012 querying Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), PsychInfo, PubMed, and Scopus identified EM studies using hypothesis-testing or observational investigations of educational interventions. Two reviewers independently screened all of the publications and removed articles using established exclusion criteria. This year, publications limited to a single-site survey design that measured satisfaction or self-assessment on unvalidated instruments were not formally reviewed. Six reviewers then independently ranked all remaining publications using one of two scoring systems depending on whether the study methodology was primarily qualitative or quantitative. Each scoring system had nine criteria, including four related to methodology, that were chosen a priori, to standardize evaluation by reviewers. The quantitative study scoring system was used previously to appraise medical education published annually in 2008 through 2011, while a separate, new qualitative study scoring system was derived and implemented consisting of parallel metrics. Results Forty-eight medical education research papers met the a priori criteria for inclusion, and 33 (30 quantitative and three qualitative studies) were reviewed. Seven quantitative and two qualitative studies met the criteria for inclusion as exemplary and are summarized in this article. Conclusions This critical appraisal series aims to promote superior education research by reviewing and highlighting nine of the 48 major education research studies with relevance to EM published in 2012. Current trends and common methodologic pitfalls in the 2012 papers are noted.

AB  - Abstract Pupil examination has been used as a basic measure in critically ill patients and has great importance for the prognosis and management of disease. An automated pupillometer is a computer-based infrared digital video system by which the accuracy and precision of the pupil examination are markedly improved. We conducted an observational study of pupil assessment with automated pupillometry in clinical liver transplantation settings, including pretransplant evaluations and posttransplant surveillance. Our results showed that unconscious patients (grade 4 hepatic encephalopathy) had a prolonged latency phase (left side: 283 ± 80 milliseconds; right side: 295 ± 96 milliseconds) and a reduced pupillary constrictive ratio (left direct response: 0.23 ± 0.10; left indirect response: 0.21 ± 0.07; right direct response: 0.20 ± 0.08; right indirect response: 0.21 ± 0.08) in comparison with normal and conscious patients. After liver transplantation, the recovery of pupillography in these patients was slower than that in conscious patients. However, the surviving recipients without major complications all had a gradual recovery of pupillary responses, which occurred on the first or second posttransplant day. We also reported 4 cases of futile LT in the absence of pretransplant pupillary responses and other pupillary abnormalities revealed by automated pupillometry in our study. In conclusion, patients with grade 4 hepatic encephalopathy had a sluggish pupil response and a delayed recovery pattern after LT. An automated pupillometer is potentially a supplementary device for pretransplant screening and posttransplant monitoring in patients undergoing LT, but further prospective studies are required.

AB  - Objective: To report outcome in dogs after internal fixation of a sarcoma-related pathologic fracture of the appendicular skeleton. Study Design: Multi-institutional case series. Animals: Dogs (n=16). Methods: Medical records of participating VSSO members were reviewed for dogs with pathologic fracture associated with a confirmed bone sarcoma of the appendicular skeleton repaired by external or internal fixation. Dogs were included if they had a histological diagnosis of osteosarcoma or sarcoma and excluded if they had radiation before fracture. Data collected were analyzed for signalment, fracture location, staging performed, method of fracture fixation, histopathology, adjunctive treatment and outcome. Results: Signalment and fracture location of 16 dogs that met the inclusion criteria was similar to dogs with appendicular OSA without fracture. One of 14 dogs had pulmonary metastasis and 3 of 5 dogs had bone metastasis. Bone plate or interlocking nail were used for repair in 12 dogs. Limb use immediately after surgery in 13 dogs was good (4), weight-bearing but lame (7) and non-weight bearing (2). Adjunctive therapy was administered in 5 dogs (chemotherapy, 3; radiation, 4; pamidronate, 3). Survival time ranged from 18 to 897 days; median survival was 166 days. Conclusions: Repair of pathologic fracture can result in palliation and prolonged survival.

AB  - Background:? In situations of ongoing violence, childhood psychosocial and mental health problems require care. However, resources and evidence for adequate interventions are scarce for children in low- and middle-income countries. This study evaluated a school-based psychosocial intervention in conflict-affected, rural Nepal. Methods:? A cluster randomized controlled trial was used to evaluate changes on a range of indicators, including psychiatric symptoms (depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder), psychological difficulties, resilience indicators (hope, prosocial behavior) and function impairment. Children (n?=?325) (mean age?=?12.7, SD?=?1.04, range 11?14?years) with elevated psychosocial distress were allocated to a treatment or waitlist group. Results:? Comparisons of crude change scores showed significant between-group differences on several outcome indicators, with moderate effect sizes (Cohen d?=?.41 to .58). After correcting for nested variance within schools, no evidence for treatment effects was found on any outcome variable. Additional analyses showed gender effects for treatment on prosocial behavior (mean change difference: 2.70; 95% CI, .97 to 4.44), psychological difficulties (?2.19; 95% CI, ?3.82 to ?.56), and aggression (?4.42; 95% CI, ?6.16 to ?2.67). An age effect for treatment was found for hope (.90; 95% CI, ?1.54 to ?.26). Conclusions:? A school-based psychosocial intervention demonstrated moderate short-term beneficial effects for improving social-behavioral and resilience indicators among subgroups of children exposed to armed conflict. The intervention reduced psychological difficulties and aggression among boys, increased prosocial behavior among girls, and increased hope for older children. The intervention did not result in reduction of psychiatric symptoms.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare the effects of 2 training curricula on laparoscopic skills and performance of simulated surgery in veterinary students. Study design Prospective study. Sample population Veterinary students (n?=?33) with no prior hands-on experience in minimally invasive surgery. Methods Basic laparoscopic skills (BLS) were assessed based on 5 modified McGill inanimate system for training and evaluation of laparoscopic skills. Motion metrics and an objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS) were used to evaluate surgical skills during a simulated laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed in an augmented reality simulator. Students were randomly assigned to either skill-based (group A) or procedural-based (group B) training curriculum. Both tests were performed prior to and after a 10-session training curriculum. Results Post-training BLS results were improved in both training groups (P?<?.001). Seven participants completed both presimulated and postsimulated laparoscopic cholecystectomy, preventing paired analysis. Based on motion metrics analysis, participants completed tasks in a shorter time (P?=?.0187), and with better economy of movement (P?=?.0457) after training. No difference was detected in OSATS before and after training. Conclusion Both training curricula improved BLS, but significant differences were not detected between the procedural-based training program and basic skills training alone in veterinary students. Motion metrics such as time, economy of movement, and instrument path were superior to an OSATS, when assessing surgical performance. Further studies are needed to compare the effects of different simulators on the training of veterinarians with diverse laparoscopic surgical experience.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the frequency, types, and risk factors for acute perioperative adverse events (AEs) in dogs that had ventral slot decompression (VSD) for cervical intervertebral disc disease (IVDD). Design Retrospective, case?control study. Animals Dogs (n?=?546) with cervical IVDD treated by VSD; 54 cases experiencing AE and 492 controls. Methods Historical, clinical, diagnostic, operative, and outcome data were collected. AE were graded using a Spine Adverse Events Severity (SAVES) system. Associations between the development of AE and hypothesized risk factors were analyzed using bi- and multi-variable analyses. Results AE were observed in 54 dogs (9.9%). Minor AE (SAVES Grade 1?2) occurred in 3.5% (19 dogs) and major (SAVES Grades 3?5) AE in 6.4% (35 dogs). Deterioration in neurologic status (n?=?13), persistent pain (12), and intraoperative hemorrhage (7) were common major AE. NSAID administration, surgeon experience, C7?T1 disc location, and intraoperative hypotension were significantly associated with AE in multivariate analyses. Improvement of AE occurred in 48/54 (88.9%) of cases, although reoperative neurosurgery was required in 48.5% (17/35) of dogs experiencing major AE. Dogs with major AE had significantly longer hospitalization and worse outcomes than dogs with minor AE or controls. No fatal AE occurred, although 0.7% (4/546) of dogs were euthanatized postoperatively. Conclusions AE occurred in 9.9% of dogs that had VSD, and were significantly associated with perioperative hypotension, C7?T1 disc extrusions, surgeon experience, and NSAID usage. Identification of a major postoperative AE is an indication for immediate diagnostic imaging studies, as 50% of dogs experiencing major AE required reoperation.

AB  - Abstract Background Pain and fatigue are commonly associated with work-related upper extremity disorders. Occasionally these symptoms persist beyond a reasonable healing period. One potential explanation for prolonged symptom expression is the concurrent development of a stress-mediated illness or CMI (Chronic Multi-Symptom Illness). In such a scenario, the chronic regional pain and other symptoms that the individual is experiencing would be attributable to the CMI rather than to tissue damage or a biomechanical dysfunction of the upper-extremity. Methods This article critically reviews the case definitions of the new class of CMI disorders and evaluates the existing evidence supporting centrally mediated physiological changes (e.g., sensory hypervigilance, dysautonomia) that manifest as symptoms of pain and fatigue in some individuals experiencing chronic stressors. Results While explanations for prolonged pain and fatigue have historically focused on mechanisms involving peripheral pathology or psychiatric explanations, ample evidences support the role of altered Central Nervous System function in accounting for symptom manifestation in CMI. Conclusions A model is presented that unites seemingly disparate findings across numerous investigations and provides a framework for understanding how genetics, triggering events, stressors, and early life events can affect CNS activity. Resultant symptom expression (e.g., pain and fatigue) from central dysregulation would be expected to occur in a subset of individuals in the population, including a subset of individuals with work-related upper extremity disorders. Thus when symptoms such as pain and fatigue persist beyond a reasonable period, consideration of CMI and associated assessment and interventions focused on central mechanisms may be worthwhile. Am.

AB  - Abstract:? Injuries to the upper cervical spine (UCS) are common in traumatic deaths and postmortem computed tomography (PMCT) may contribute to the forensic investigation. This study presents PMCT in comparison with autopsy in the examination of UCS injury. Thirteen consecutive cases with UCS fracture and/or cranio-cervical dislocation were examined with PMCT and autopsy, and the findings were correlated. Neither of the techniques identified all UCS injuries. Fractures of atlas and axis were best visualized with PMCT whereas cranio-cervical dislocation was better identified during autopsy. Serious injuries were present after both high- and low-energy trauma. Medico-legal autopsy in combination with PMCT produced a thorough evaluation of UCS injuries. By combining these procedures detailed investigations, including accident reconstruction and injury pattern analysis, can be performed. This study supports the routine application of PMCT, as a supplement to the medico-legal autopsy of deaths with UCS injuries.

AB  - Total disc replacement using tissue-engineered intervertebral discs (TE-IVDs) may offer a biological alternative to treat radiculopathy caused by disc degeneration. A composite TE-IVD was previously developed and evaluated in rat tail and beagle cervical spine models in vivo. Although cell viability and tissue integration into host tissue were promising, significant implant displacement occurred at multiple spinal levels. The goal of the present study was to assess the effects of a resorbable plating system on the stiffness of motion segments and stability of tissue-engineered implants subjected to axial compression. Canine motion segments from levels C2/C3 to C5/C6 were assessed as intact (CTRL), after discectomy (Dx), with an implanted TE-IVD only (PLATE?), and with a TE-IVD combined with an attached resorbable plate (PLATE+). Segments under PLATE+ conditions fully restored separation between endplates and showed significantly higher compressive stiffness than segments under PLATE? conditions. Plated segments partially restored more than 25% of the CTRL motion segment stiffness. Plate attachment also prevented implant extrusion from the disc space at 50% compressive strain, and this effect was more significant in segments from levels C3/C4 when compared to segments from level C5/C6. These results suggest that stabilization of motion segments via resorbable plating assists TE-IVD retention in the disc space while allowing the opportunity for implants to fully integrate into the host tissue and achieve optimal restoration of spine biomechanics.

AB  - New-onset diabetes after liver transplantation (NODALT) is a frequent complication with an unfavorable outcome. We previously demonstrated a crucial link between donor graft genetics and the risk of NODALT. We selected 15 matched pairs of NODALT and non-NODALT liver recipients using propensity score matching analysis. The donor liver tissues were tested for the expression of 10 microRNAs (miRNAs) regulating human hepatic glucose homeostasis. The biological functions of potential target genes were predicted using gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. Both miR-103 and miR-181a were significantly highly expressed in the NODALT group as compared to the non-NODALT group. The predicted target genes (e.g. Irs2, Pik3r1, Akt2, and Gsk3b) were involved in glucose import and the insulin signaling pathway. We also observed dysregulation of miRNAs (e.g. let-7, miR-26b, miR-145, and miR-183) in cultured human hepatocytes treated with tacrolimus or high glucose, the two independent risk factors of NODALT identified in this cohort. The hepatic miRNA profiles altered by tacrolimus or hyperglycemia were associated with insulin resistance and glucose homeostatic imbalance as revealed by enrichment analysis. The disease susceptibility miRNA expressive pattern could be imported directly from the donor and consolidated by the transplant factors.

AB  - Abstract Research in humans and animals has shown that negative childhood experiences (NCE) can have long-term effects on the structure and function of the brain. Alterations have been noted in grey and white matter, in the brain's resting state, on the glutamatergic system, and on neural and behavioural responses to aversive stimuli. These effects can be linked to psychiatric disorder such as depression and anxiety disorders that are influenced by excessive exposure to early life stressors. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of NCEs on these systems. Resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI), aversion task fMRI, glutamate magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) were combined with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) in healthy subjects to examine the impact of NCEs on the brain. Low CTQ scores, a measure of NCEs, were related to higher resting state glutamate levels and higher resting state entropy in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). CTQ scores, mPFC glutamate and entropy, correlated with neural BOLD responses to the anticipation of aversive stimuli in regions throughout the aversion-related network, with strong correlations between all measures in the motor cortex and left insula. Structural connectivity strength, measured using mean fractional anisotropy, between the mPFC and left insula correlated to aversion-related signal changes in the motor cortex. These findings highlight the impact of NCEs on multiple inter-related brain systems. In particular, they highlight the role of a prefrontal-insular-motor cortical network in the processing and responsivity to aversive stimuli and its potential adaptability by NCEs.

It has been postulated that the use of lasers emitting at wavelengths designed for radiation absorption by water would decrease local tissue trauma. Study Design/Materials and Methods We have examined the use of a Nd:YAG laser designed to emit at 1.44 ?m, an absorption peak for water, and compared the results of laser ablation at 1.06 ?m, 1.32 ?m, and 1.44 ?m wavelengths. Nd:YAG laser angioplasty was performed in the abdominal aorta of White Leghorn roosters. Acute and chronic vascular trauma was assessed by contrast angiography and histological analysis. Results There was a significant decrease in early mortality with 1.44 ?m laser ablation. This decreased mortality after 1.44 ?m ablation was associated with a decrease in vascular spasm, perforation, and thermal damage. Atherosclerotic plaque development at follow up was decreased with 1.44 ?m ablation but this was not significant. Conclusion 1.44 ?m laser ablation decreases early vascular trauma and mortality and may decrease subsequent atherosclerotic plaque development. ? 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Thermal trauma causes tissue damage by membrane destabilization and energy depletion at the cellular level, resulting in tissue necrosis and inflammation leading to delayed cell death. One therapeutic approach is to block the immediate triggering of the inflammatory cascade that results in prolonged hypermetabolic responses and immune dysfunction while promoting the expression of growth factors. In the present study, we determined hepatic gene expression responses to insulin-like growth factors-i (IGF-I) gene transfer to burned rats using high-density DNA microarray assays. The expression of 123 out of ~8,800 genes assyed (1.4% of total) were significantly altered. Of these, 42 genes were altered irrespective of treatment by burn trauma (p < 0.05). Changes in gene expression were confirmed by measuring mRNA levels using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein levels by Western blot assays. DNA microarray analyses showed two major mechanisms that mediated beneficial outcomes after IGF-I gene transfer in the burned rat livers. These mechanisms were the stimulation of IGF binding protein potentiation of peripheral IGF-I and the inhibition of the burn-augmented pro-apoptotic and oxidative mitochondrial metabolites stimulated by thermal trauma.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Thrombosis of the pancreas after transplantation is the most common cause of relaparotomy and resultant graft loss. There is currently no standard protocol consistently proven to prevent thrombosis following transplantation. Our objective was to determine whether our protocol of post-operative low-dose intravenous (IV) heparin infusion would prevent graft thrombosis without additional complications in our patients. Methods A total of 66 simultaneous pancreas kidney (SPK) transplants were performed at our institution from 2004 to 2014. Patients were divided into 2 retrospective cohort groups. Group 1 patients received only acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 81 mg/d started on post-operative day 1. Group 2 patients received IV heparin infusion beginning in the recovery room at a rate of 500 IU/h for the first 24 hours, reduced by 100 IU/h every day to stop on day 5, and then received ASA 81 mg/d afterward. Outcome and complication rates were compared between the two groups for 5 years post-transplant. Results We observed a significant reduction in graft thrombosis and graft loss with (0/29) patients in the heparin group vs (7/33) 25.7% from the non-heparin (P<.01) with no differences in complication rates. Conclusions We present a heparin infusion protocol which may help prevent graft thrombosis and graft loss in SPK transplantation.

AB  - Summary Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a dynamic pathological process where excess amounts of thrombin, the principal role player in the clotting pathway, are generated intravascularly. The diagnosis of DIC is very often suspected in critically ill patients although the clinical features can vary according to the underlying disease state initiating this process. A combination of tests performed in repeats is necessary to reliably diagnose DIC. The principal aim in the management of this condition involves timely and appropriate treatment of the triggering process with adequate transfusion support and certain therapeutic agents in selected situations.

AB  - Background: The aim of the present study was to determine those factors which contribute to a poor outcome and to propose a management plan that is complementary to trauma systems in common use. Methods: A prospective study of 110 consecutive patients with moderate head injury (post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 9?13) was carried out. Results: A total of 75% of the patients sustained multisystem trauma, generally of minor or moderate grade according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). However, the death rate increased with the severity of the injury as measured by the Injury Severity Score (ISS). The initial cranial computed tomography (CT) scan was abnormal in 61% and no patient with a normal scan developed a delayed intracranial haematoma or neurological worsening. Those patients who developed a delayed intracerebral haematoma had a worse outcome. Sixteen patients underwent craniotomy for haematoma. The intracranial pressure (ICP) was measured selectively in 20 patients and exceeded 20 mmHg in half, requiring treatment. Nine patients died, four as a result of head injury and all those had an intracranial haematoma. As a group, those who died were older and had a higher ISS. Conclusions: A plan for care of patients with moderate head injury is proposed, complementary to the Early Management of Severe Trauma (EMST) protocol and the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia guidelines for neurotrauma management in rural and remote locations.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the human and companion animal veterinary literature on nosocomial infections and antimicrobial drug resistance as they pertain to the critically ill patient. Data sources: Data from human and veterinary sources were reviewed using PubMed and CAB. Human data synthesis: There is a large amount of published data on nosocomially-acquired bloodstream infections, pneumonia, urinary tract infections and surgical site infections, and strategies to minimize the frequency of these infections, in human medicine. Nosocomial infections caused by multi-drug-resistant (MDR) pathogens are a leading cause of increased patient morbidity and mortality, medical treatment costs, and prolonged hospital stay. Epidemiology and risk factor analyses have shown that the major risk factor for the development of antimicrobial resistance in critically ill human patients is heavy antibiotic usage. Veterinary data synthesis: There is a paucity of information on the development of antimicrobial drug resistance and nosocomially-acquired infections in critically ill small animal veterinary patients. Mechanisms of antimicrobial drug resistance are universal, although the selection effects created by antibiotic usage may be less significant in veterinary patients. Future studies on the development of antimicrobial drug resistance in critically ill animals may benefit from research that has been conducted in humans. Conclusions: Antimicrobial use in critically ill patients selects for antimicrobial drug resistance and MDR nosocomial pathogens. The choice of antimicrobials should be prudent and based on regular surveillance studies and accurate microbiological diagnostics. Antimicrobial drug resistance is becoming an increasing problem in veterinary medicine, particularly in the critical care setting, and institution-specific strategies should be developed to prevent the emergence of MDR infections. The collation of data from tertiary-care veterinary hospitals may identify trends in antimicrobial drug resistance patterns in nosocomial pathogens and aid in formulating guidelines for antimicrobial use.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the outcome and prognostic variables associated with long-term survival and complications in dogs undergoing hepatic lobectomy of the central division. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Sixty-one client-owned dogs with central division masses. Methods Medical records of dogs undergoing hepatic lobectomy of the central division from January 1, 2000 to January 1, 2015 were reviewed for signalment, clinical signs, preoperative staging, preoperative cytology or biopsy results, date of procedure, location of mass, surgical technique, whether cholecystectomy or cholecystopexy was performed, complications, histopathologic diagnosis and margin evaluation, date of local recurrence or detection of metastatic disease, and survival. Results Hilar resection was associated with increased intraoperative and postoperative complications. Intraoperative complications occurred in 29 dogs, with 20 dogs experiencing intraoperative hemorrhage. Nineteen dogs required transfusions. Immediate postoperative complications occurred in 20 dogs. Perioperative mortality rate was 11%, and 2-week mortality rate was 14.7%. The median survival time for dogs with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was not reached. The 1- and 3-year censored survival rates for dogs with HCC was 82.1% and 82.1%, respectively. Margin status did not impact survival time. Conclusion Hepatic lobectomy of the central division was associated with hemorrhage in approximately 33% of dogs, but there was a relatively low perioperative mortality rate. Hepatic lobectomy for HCC resulted in long-term survival, regardless of margin status. Clinical significance Surgeons should anticipate the requirement for blood products in dogs that may require hepatic lobectomy of the central division. Long-term survival can be expected after surgical treatment of HCC, regardless of margin status.
