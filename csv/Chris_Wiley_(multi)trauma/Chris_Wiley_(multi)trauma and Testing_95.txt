AB  - Abstract Adult college students (N = 108; M age = 24.3 years old) completed multidimensional measures of perfectionism (self-oriented, other-oriented, and socially-prescribed perfectionism) and behavioral rigidity (attitudinal flexibility, psychomotor speed, and motor-cognitive rigidity). Attitudinal flexibility was negatively related to all three forms of perfectionism, and motor-cognitive rigidity was positively related to self-oriented perfectionism. Multiple regression analyses indicated that attitude flexibility and motor-cognitive rigidity were significant predictors of self-oriented perfectionism, while attitude-flexibility alone was the significant predictor of socially-prescribed perfectionism. No measure of rigidity was a significant predictor of other-oriented perfectionism. Thus, dimensions of perfectionism may be predicted with different measures of cognitive-behavioral rigidity. ? 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the human and companion animal veterinary literature on nosocomial infections and antimicrobial drug resistance as they pertain to the critically ill patient. Data sources: Data from human and veterinary sources were reviewed using PubMed and CAB. Human data synthesis: There is a large amount of published data on nosocomially-acquired bloodstream infections, pneumonia, urinary tract infections and surgical site infections, and strategies to minimize the frequency of these infections, in human medicine. Nosocomial infections caused by multi-drug-resistant (MDR) pathogens are a leading cause of increased patient morbidity and mortality, medical treatment costs, and prolonged hospital stay. Epidemiology and risk factor analyses have shown that the major risk factor for the development of antimicrobial resistance in critically ill human patients is heavy antibiotic usage. Veterinary data synthesis: There is a paucity of information on the development of antimicrobial drug resistance and nosocomially-acquired infections in critically ill small animal veterinary patients. Mechanisms of antimicrobial drug resistance are universal, although the selection effects created by antibiotic usage may be less significant in veterinary patients. Future studies on the development of antimicrobial drug resistance in critically ill animals may benefit from research that has been conducted in humans. Conclusions: Antimicrobial use in critically ill patients selects for antimicrobial drug resistance and MDR nosocomial pathogens. The choice of antimicrobials should be prudent and based on regular surveillance studies and accurate microbiological diagnostics. Antimicrobial drug resistance is becoming an increasing problem in veterinary medicine, particularly in the critical care setting, and institution-specific strategies should be developed to prevent the emergence of MDR infections. The collation of data from tertiary-care veterinary hospitals may identify trends in antimicrobial drug resistance patterns in nosocomial pathogens and aid in formulating guidelines for antimicrobial use.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the outcome and prognostic variables associated with long-term survival and complications in dogs undergoing hepatic lobectomy of the central division. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Sixty-one client-owned dogs with central division masses. Methods Medical records of dogs undergoing hepatic lobectomy of the central division from January 1, 2000 to January 1, 2015 were reviewed for signalment, clinical signs, preoperative staging, preoperative cytology or biopsy results, date of procedure, location of mass, surgical technique, whether cholecystectomy or cholecystopexy was performed, complications, histopathologic diagnosis and margin evaluation, date of local recurrence or detection of metastatic disease, and survival. Results Hilar resection was associated with increased intraoperative and postoperative complications. Intraoperative complications occurred in 29 dogs, with 20 dogs experiencing intraoperative hemorrhage. Nineteen dogs required transfusions. Immediate postoperative complications occurred in 20 dogs. Perioperative mortality rate was 11%, and 2-week mortality rate was 14.7%. The median survival time for dogs with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was not reached. The 1- and 3-year censored survival rates for dogs with HCC was 82.1% and 82.1%, respectively. Margin status did not impact survival time. Conclusion Hepatic lobectomy of the central division was associated with hemorrhage in approximately 33% of dogs, but there was a relatively low perioperative mortality rate. Hepatic lobectomy for HCC resulted in long-term survival, regardless of margin status. Clinical significance Surgeons should anticipate the requirement for blood products in dogs that may require hepatic lobectomy of the central division. Long-term survival can be expected after surgical treatment of HCC, regardless of margin status.

AB  - Summary We conducted a multicentre study of 1844 patients from 42 Spanish intensive care units, and analysed the clinical characteristics of brain death, the use of ancillary testing, and the clinical decisions taken after the diagnosis of brain death. The main cause of brain death was intracerebral haemorrhage (769/1844, 42%), followed by traumatic brain injury (343/1844, 19%) and subarachnoid haemorrhage (257/1844, 14%). The diagnosis of brain death was made rapidly (50% in the first 24 h). Of those patients who went on to die, the Glasgow Coma Scale on admission was ≤ 8/15 in 1146/1261 (91%) of patients with intracerebral haemorrhage, traumatic brain injury or anoxic encephalopathy; the Hunt and Hess Scale was 4?5 in 207/251 (83%) of patients following subarachnoid haemorrhage; and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was ≥ 15 in 114/129 (89%) of patients with strokes. Brain death was diagnosed exclusively by clinical examination in 92/1844 (5%) of cases. Electroencephalography was the most frequently used ancillary test (1303/1752, 70.7%), followed by transcranial Doppler (652/1752, 37%). Organ donation took place in 70% of patients (1291/1844), with medical unsuitability (267/553, 48%) and family refusal (244/553, 13%) the main reasons for loss of potential donors. All life-sustaining measures were withdrawn in 413/553 of non-donors (75%).

AB  - Abstract Objective To report perioperative characteristics, complications, histopathologic diagnosis and outcome in cats undergoing surgical treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Study design Multi-institutional, retrospective case series. Animals Thirty-two client-owned cats. Methods Medical records of cats treated with surgical removal of 1 or more parathyroid gland(s) with confirmed histopathologic evaluation were reviewed. Cats were divided into preoperative ionized calcium (iCa) groups corresponding to the 33rd, 67th, and 100th percentiles of the preoperative iCa results of the study population. Follow-up consisted of phone conversation with owners or primary veterinarian. Results Ionized calcium was above reference range in all cats (median 1.8?mmol/L [interquartile range, 1.5?1.9]). Abnormal tissue was excised after cervical exploration in all cats. The most common histopathologic diagnoses were parathyroid adenoma in 20 of 32 (62.5%) cats and parathyroid carcinoma in 7 of 32 (21.9%) cats. At discharge, 6 of 32 (18.8%) cats had hypercalcemia, 5 of 32 (15.6%) had hypocalcemia, and 21 of 32 (65.6%) were normocalcemic. Preoperative iCa did not correlate with postoperative iCa. The median follow-up time was 332?days (range, 7?3156). Overall median survival time was 1109?days (95% CI, 856?1332). Survival time was not associated with preoperative iCa group, hypocalcemia at discharge, hypercalcemia at discharge, or diagnosis of carcinoma. Conclusion In this cohort of cats, parathyroid adenoma was the most common cause of PHPT, and surgical treatment resulted in very good median survival time. Preoperative iCa was not predictive of postoperative hypocalcemia. Clinical significance Surgical parathyroidectomy for treatment of PHPT in cats provides a favorable prognosis.

AB  - Introduction Alkalinizing agents have been given to horses before exercise to provide exogenous buffering effects. The objective of this experiment was to determine the intra- and inter-day variability of resting plasma tCO2. The hypothesis was that tCO2 would vary measurably during a multi-day quarantine. Methods Eight acclimated sedentary horses had jugular venous samples collected into 10-ml heparinized evacuated glass tubes 3 times daily (7 AM, 11 AM, and 3 PM) for 5 consecutive days. Horses ate 5.3?kg alfalfa hay at both 7 AM and 3 PM after blood sampling. Plasma tCO2 was determined within 1?3 hours of sampling using an automated chemistry analyzer. Mean tCO2 for all 8 horses was calculated for each of the 15 sampling intervals. Results were compared by Repeated Measures ANOVA. When there was no apparent day-to-day effect, data for all horses were pooled by time-of-day (n?=?40 samples for each of 3 times-of-day) and compared by the Student's t test to determine time-of-day effect. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results Mean tCO2 over the 15 sampling intervals ranged from 28.9-to-31.6?mmol/L and was lower at 11 AM (Day 1) and 3 PM (Days 1, 3, and 4) compared to 7 AM on Day 1 (P<0.05). Individual plasma tCO2 ranged over 4-to-7 units (low 26, high 34, widest range 26?32, narrowest 28?31). Mean pooled tCO2 differed by time-of-day, with 11 AM (30.1?±?0.2, P?=?0.011) and 3 PM (29.8?±?0.2, P<0.001) values lower than 7 AM values (31.0?±?0.2). Conclusions Plasma tCO2 differed significantly by time-of-day with considerable intra- and inter-individual variability.

AB  - Introduction The objective of this study was to provide more information regarding the relationship between heart rate (HR) and performance in show-jumpers. Methods Ten mixed breed horses (9.1?±?1.9?yrs) were assessed at a British Equestrian Federation (BEF) World Class Performance three-day training session. Riders received coaching during warm-up (WU) and after jumping a 15 fence (1.35?1.45?m) course once on day-1, twice on days 2  on day-3 the second round was an 8-fence jump-off. Clinical assessments were performed, and plasma lactate concentrations determined, pre- and post-exercise. Take-off distance (TDF) was determined using high-speed motion capture. The coach graded horse jumping technique (validated methodology). HR was recorded telemetrically from WU until 10?mins post-exercise. Variables were compared using regression procedures/Spearman correlation and paired Students t-test (P<0.05). Results HR was not significantly different between days or consecutive jumping rounds. Mean HR was lower in WU than during the course (127?±?11 vs 136?±?16: P?=?0.027), likely related to increased speed during the course, although HRpeak tended to be higher during WU day- 1 possibly reflecting excitement. Mean HR increased for each quarter during the course. Higher mean course and third-quarter HR were associated with higher blood lactate concentrations (P?=?0.047), greater gluteal and longissimus dorsi muscle spasm on palpation (P<0.01), more faults (P?=?0.044) and lower technique scores (P?=?0.019). TDF was negatively correlated with mean course and third-quarter HR, indicating that closer take-off may be harder work (P<0.01). Conclusions HR increases throughout a jumping course. Higher HRs may be associated with jumping inefficiency and muscle spasm, with potential performance implications for multi-day competitions. Ethical Animal Research Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study is not stated. Sources of funding:?The World Class Development Programme is funded by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, through Exchequer and National Lottery funds, via UK Sport.

AB  - Abstract Background Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected liver transplant (LT) recipients have higher risk of graft loss than HIV-uninfected recipients. As the original donor risk index excluded HIV-positive patients, donor factors associated with graft loss in HIV-positive recipients are unknown. Methods Identifying all HIV-positive patients in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, supplemented by all HIV-infected patients in the solid organ transplantation in HIV: Multi-Site Study (HIV-TR), we evaluated donor factors associated with graft loss among HIV-positive recipients transplanted between March 2002 and August 2012. Results A total of 249 HIV-positive LT recipients were followed for median 2.4 (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.8?4.9) years. In univariate analysis, donor diabetes (HR=2.09; P=.002) and donor hypertension (HR=1.43; P=.048) were significantly associated with graft loss, and African-American (AA) recipient:non-AA donor race mismatch (HR=1.60; P=.07), other cause of donor death compared to trauma (HR=2.02; P=.09), and donor age 30 years or older (HR=1.53; P=.05) were of borderline significance. In multivariate analysis, donor diabetes (HR=2.12; 95% CI: 1.33?3.38; P=.002) was the only significant predictor of graft loss. Conclusion In HIV-positive LT recipients, risk of graft loss is strongly influenced by donor diabetes. This information may be useful to transplant physicians seeking to optimize overall graft survival in their HIV-positive LT recipients.

AB  - Summary Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) has been described in foals for over 80 years. This condition has a diversity of names including ?dummy foals', ?wanderers', ?barkers', neonatal encephalopathy, neonatal maladjustment syndrome (NMS) and perinatal asphyxia syndrome (PAS). The latter descriptive terms are all encompassing for a syndrome that has varying degrees of multi-systemic effects rather than just neurological disease. While foals with PAS are commonly reported in the literature, the aetiology and underlying pathophysiology are still very poorly understood, with a majority of the information extrapolated from human and animal models. Currently, no antemortem test exists and diagnosis is made based on the history of the mare and foal as well as reliance on clinical signs. Recent studies have shown that neuroactive pregnanes may play a key role in the syndrome; however, further research is needed to clarify these findings. Another investigation compared neurobiomarkers for brain injury in both sick and normal neonatal foals. The mainstay of therapy for PAS is supportive treatment. Specific therapies such as antioxidants and neuroprotectants are used by some clinicians but little scientific evidence exists that proves the therapeutic protocols implemented improve overall outcome. Prevention of PAS in foals revolves around the health of the mare including, but not limited to, the prevention of placentitis or other illnesses and observation and/or intervention during parturition when necessary. More research is necessary to fully comprehend this syndrome, its diagnosis and treatment options.

AB  - Objective To examine perioperative mortality, long-term survival, causes of death, and prognostic factors for dogs and cats undergoing surgical excision of thymic epithelial tumors (TETs). Study Design Multi-institutional case series. Animals Eighty dogs and 32 cats. Methods Follow-up information was obtained for dogs and cats that underwent surgical excision of a TET between 2001 and 2012. Results Perioperative mortality was 20% in dogs and 22% in cats. No independent risk factors for perioperative mortality were identified. The estimated median survival time for all dogs was 1.69 years (95% CI 0.56?4.32) and the 1- and 4-year survival rates were 55% (95% CI 44?67) and 44% (95% CI 32?56). The estimated median survival time for all cats was 3.71 years (95% CI 0.56-unestimatable) and the 1- and 4-year survival rates were 70% (95% CI 53?87) and 47% (95% CI 0?100). Of animals that survived to discharge, 42% of dogs and 20% of cats eventually died of TET-related causes. The presence of paraneoplastic syndromes (hazard ratio [HR] 5.78, 95% CI 1.64?20.45, P?=?.007) or incomplete histologic margins (HR 6.09, 95% CI 1.50?24.72, P?=?.01) were independently associated with decreased survival in dogs. No significant predictors of survival were identified in cats. Conclusions regarding the effect of chemotherapy or radiation therapy could not be made. Conclusions While there is substantial risk of perioperative death in dogs and cats undergoing surgery for TETs, many animals that survive to discharge have prolonged survival. Survival is significantly decreased in dogs with paraneoplastic syndromes or incomplete histologic margins.

AB  - Abstract Aims Patients with central venous catheters who are transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit to the care of an anesthesiology team for an operation or interventional radiology procedure had excessive rates of catheter associated blood stream infection (CABSI). Methods We convened a multi-disciplinary team to audit anesthesia practice and to develop countermeasures for those aspects of practice that were thought to be contributing to CABSI's. It was noted that provider behavior changed in the presence of an auditor (Hawthorne effect) and so videorecordings were used, in the hope that this Hawthorne effect would be reduced. Clips were chosen from the hours of video (without audio) recordings that showed medication administration, airway management and touching the anesthesia cart of equipment/supplies. Results These clips were viewed by three observers and measurements were made to assess intra-rater and inter-rater reliability. The clips were then viewed to quantify differences in practice before and after our bundle of ?best practices? was introduced. Conclusions Although video recording has been used to evaluate adherence to resuscitation protocols in both trauma and in neonatal resuscitation, (Pediatric Emergency Care, 26, 2010, 803; Pediatrics, 117, 2006, 658; Pediatrics, 106, 2000, 654) we believe this is the first time that video has been used to record before and after behaviors for an anesthesia quality improvement initiative.

AB  - Abstract Objective To quantify stability in cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) deficient canine stifles with hamstring grafts affixed at 3 femoral locations. Study Design Canine stifle motion study using a multi-cohort, repeated measures design. Sample Population 27 canine cadaver stifles. Methods Hamstring grafts (HG) were affixed at the gracilis-semitendinosus insertion and on the lateral femur (1) proximal trochlear ridge (TR), (2) craniodistal to fabella (F), or (3) condyle center (CC). Total, cranial, and caudal tibial translation and total, medial, and lateral angular displacement, with and without translational load, were quantified with the CrCL intact, transected, and reconstructed. Angular displacement was quantified from points on the distal femur and proximal tibia. Graft strain was calculated from tissue displacement measured at joint angles of 30°, 60°, 90°, and 120°. Results Tibial translation was lowest in F constructs, which also achieved the least difference in tibial translation from intact stifles. Tibial translation was lower in intact stifles than in CrCL transected or reconstructed stifles. Less angular displacement of the proximal tibia was detected in the medial than in the lateral direction, and tibial displacement was lower in the cranial than the caudal direction. Angular displacement was lowest in the F treatment group. F constructs had the lowest graft strain at joint angles greater than 30°. Conclusions Femoral fixation of a canine hamstring graft craniodistal to the lateral fabella conferred the best joint stability and lowest graft strain in vitro. No fixation method restored joint stability of the intact CrCL.

AB  - Abstract Background:? To provide a score to predict the risk of early mortality after single craniocerebral gunshot wound (GSW) based on three clinical parameters. Methods:? All patients admitted to Baragwanath Hospital, Johannesburg, South Africa, between October 2000 and May 2005 for an isolated single craniocerebral GSW were retrospectively evaluated for the documentation of (i) blood pressure (BP) on admission; (ii) inspection of the bullet entry and exit site; and (iii) initial consciousness (n= 214). Results:? Conscious GSW victims had an early mortality risk of 8.3%, unconscious patients a more than fourfold higher risk (39.2%). Patients with a systolic BP between 100 and 199?mm?Hg had an 18.2% risk of mortality. Hypotension (<100?mm?Hg) doubled this risk (37.7%) and severe hypertension (≥200?mm?Hg) was associated with an even higher mortality rate of 57.1%. Patients without brain spilling out of the wound (?non-oozer?) exhibited a mortality of 19.7%, whereas it was twice as high (43.3%) in patients with brain spill (?oozer?). By logistic regression, a prognostic index for each variant of the evaluated parameters could be established: non-oozer:0, oozer:1, conscious:0, unconscious:2, 100 ≤RRsys < 200?mm?Hg:0, RRsys < 100?mm?Hg:1, RRsys≥ 200?mm?Hg:2. This resulted in a score (0?5) by which the individual risk of early mortality after GSW can be anticipated. Conclusions:? Three immediately obtainable clinical parameters were evaluated and a score for predicting the risk of early mortality after a single craniocerebral GSW was established.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? Brief motivational interventions have shown promise in reducing harmful behaviors. The authors tested an intervention to increase safety belt use (SBU) among emergency department (ED) patients. Methods:? From February 2006 to May 2006, the authors conducted a randomized trial of adult ED patients at a teaching hospital in Boston. ED patients were systematically sampled for self-reported SBU. Those with SBU other than ?always? were asked to participate. At baseline, participants answered a 9-item series of situational SBU questions, each scored on a 5-point Likert scale. SBU was defined as a continuous variable (9-item average) and as a dichotomous variable (response of ?always? across all items). Participants were randomized to an intervention or a control group. The intervention group received a 5- to 7-minute intervention, adapted from classic motivational interviewing techniques, by a trained interventionist. Participants completed a 3-month follow-up phone survey to determine changes from baseline SBU. Continuous and dichotomous SBU were analyzed via analysis of covariance and chi-square testing. Results:? Of 432 eligible patients, 292 enrolled (mean age 35?years, standard deviation [SD] ±11 years; 61% male). At baseline, the intervention and control groups had similar mean (±SD) SBU scores (2.8 [±1.1] vs. 2.6 [±1.1], p?=?0.31) and SBU prevalence (each 0%). At 3?months, 81% completed follow-up. The intervention group had significantly greater improvement in mean (±SD) SBU scores than controls (0.76 [±0.91] vs. 0.34 [±0.88], p?<?0.001). Also, SBU prevalence of ?always? was higher for the intervention group than controls (14.4% vs. 5.9%, p?=?0.03). Conclusions:? Participants receiving a brief motivational intervention reported higher SBU at follow-up compared to controls. An ED-based intervention may be useful to increase SBU.

AB  - Abstract Background information Continued advances in stem cell biology and stem cell transplantation rely on non-invasive biomarkers to characterise cells and stem cell aggregates. The non-invasive quality of such biomarkers is essential because exogenous labels, probes or reporters can unintentionally and dramatically alter stem cell state as can disruption of cell?cell and cell?matrix interactions. Here, we investigate the utility of the autofluorescent metabolite, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), as a non-invasive, intrinsic biomarker of cell death when detected with multi-photon optical-based approaches. To test this possibility, cell death was induced in murine embryoid bodies (EBs) at an early stage (day 3) of differentiation using staurosporine, an ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor of electron transport. Several hours after staurosporine treatment, EBs were stained with a single-colour, live/dead probe. A single-cross-sectional plane of each EB was imaged to detect the fluorescence intensity of the live/dead probe (extrinsic fluorescence) as well as the fluorescence intensity of NADH (intrinsic fluorescence). EBs were assessed at subsequent time points (days 6?12) for the formation of beating areas as an indicator of functional differentiation. Results Statistical comparison indicated a strong positive correlation between extrinsic fluorescence intensity of the live/dead stain and intrinsic fluorescence of NADH, suggesting that the intensity of NADH fluorescence could be used to reliably and non-invasively assess death of cells of EBs. Furthermore, EBs that had high levels of cell death soon after aggregate formation had limited ability to give rise to functional cardiomyocytes at later time points. Conclusions We demonstrate the utility of NADH fluorescence intensity as a non-invasive indicator of cell death in stem cell aggregates when measured using multi-photon excitation. In addition, we show that the degree of stem cell death at early stages of differentiation is predictive for the formation of functional cardiomyocytes.

AB  - A liver, heart, iliac vessel and two kidneys were recovered from a 39-year-old man who died of traumatic head injury and were transplanted into five recipients. The liver recipient 18 days posttransplantation presented with headache, ataxia and fever, followed by rapid neurologic decline and death. Diagnosis of granulomatous amebic encephalitis was made on autopsy. Balamuthia mandrillaris infection was confirmed with immunohistochemical and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Donor and recipients' sera were tested for B. mandrillaris antibodies. Donor brain was negative for Balamuthia by immunohistochemistry and PCR; donor serum Balamuthia antibody titer was positive (1:64). Antibody titers in all recipients were positive (range, 1:64?1:512). Recipients received a four- to five-drug combination of miltefosine or pentamidine, azithromycin, albendazole, sulfadiazine and fluconazole. Nausea, vomiting, elevated liver transaminases and renal insufficiency were common. All other recipients survived and have remained asymptomatic 24 months posttransplant. This is the third donor-derived Balamuthia infection cluster described in solid organ transplant recipients in the United States. As Balamuthia serologic testing is only available through a national reference laboratory, it is not feasible for donor screening, but may be useful to determine exposure status in recipients and to help guide chemotherapy.

AB  - Abstract Accumulated evidences indicate intestinal lesions play an important role in the pathogenesis of heatstroke. However, the underlying mechanisms by which heat stress causes intestinal barrier dysfunction and bacterial translocation remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) in heat stress-induced intestinal hyper-permeability and bacterial translocation. Intestinal permeability in heat stressed mouse was evaluated by determining plasma endotoxin concentration and urinal lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio with gastric administration of L/M solution. Venous blood, liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph node tissues were collected for bacterial load test. Real time PCR was used to determine ileum PAR1 mRNA expression. In vitro study, permeability was assessed by determining trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in human intestinal Caco-2 cell line. RWJ-58259, a selective antagonist of PAR1, was used both in vivo and in vitro studies. The results showed that heat stress could increase ileum PAR1 mRNA level, urinal L/M ratio, plasma endotoxin concentration and bacterial load in the blood, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. Blocking PAR1 with RWJ-58259 (10?mg/kg) pretreatment could significantly reduce heat stress-induced above changes, but have no role to PAR1 mRNA level. In Caco-2 cells, heat stress-induced high permeability could also be reduced by RWJ-58259 (5?20?µmol/L). In summary, our results demonstrated that PAR1 signaling pathway may play an important role in the heat stress-induced elevation of intestinal permeability, bacterial translocation and the occurrence of endotoxemia.

AB  - In the context of relationship trauma, partners' reactive patterns of engagement can disrupt and derail attempts at relationship correction and healing. A circumplex typology of couple patterns of engagement in relational trauma context is defined in terms of partners' underlying views of self in relation to other (VSIRO). VSIRO is conceptualized along a continuum anchored at opposite poles by inflated (self-aggrandizing) versus collapsed (self-abnegating) VSIRO, with a balanced (egalitarian) VSIRO, characterized by accountability and forbearance, as the target position. The circumplex model delineates four problematic couple configurations?a dejected couple, a taker?enabler couple, an ultimate fighting couple, and a debtor?collector couple. Where problematic engagement occurs, therapists need to reshape couple engagement toward the balanced, egalitarian position prior to relational trauma work. Clinical vignettes depict these couples and springboard an analysis of unique needs and interventions associated with each couple configuration. Reshaping couple patterns of engagement using a circumplex model of couple configurations is an essential prerequisite to effective and ethical relational trauma work.
