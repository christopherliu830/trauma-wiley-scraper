AB  - Abstract In this current study, a novel multilayer porous composite scaffold was fabricated with chitosan (CS), silk fibrin (SF) and nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HA). Scanning electron microscope was utilized to detect the characteristics of the composed scaffold. Rat bone marrow stromal cells (rBMSC) were loaded onto the CS/SF/n-HA scaffold and cultured in a bioreactor under an on?off dynamic compression (10% compressive strain, 0.5 Hz, [2 h action?+?4 h pause]/cycle, 4 cycles/day). Metabolism of the loaded rBMSC was assessed through CCK-8 test. Qualitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot were applied to assess the chondrogenic differentiation of the seeded cells. Compressive modulus of the cell/scaffold constructs was analyzed. Additionally, a pig model was employed to evaluate the effect of the tissue-engineered cartilage on repairing of cartilage defect. Results showed that the four layers within the scaffold were tightly connected without gaps between porous interfaces of the layers. Scaffold porosity was 92.20%?±?1.30%. The cyclic compression upregulated chondrogenesis markers (Aggrecan, Sox-9, and collagen II). Increased compressive modulus of the cell/scaffold complex was detected after dynamic compression. The pig bone marrow stromal cells/scaffold complex exposed to cyclic compression presented most favorable reparative effect on the mini pig femoral condyle cartilage defects. Our study suggested that the on?off dynamic compression might be a promising approach to fabricate tissue-engineered cartilage in vitro. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - In the context of relationship trauma, partners' reactive patterns of engagement can disrupt and derail attempts at relationship correction and healing. A circumplex typology of couple patterns of engagement in relational trauma context is defined in terms of partners' underlying views of self in relation to other (VSIRO). VSIRO is conceptualized along a continuum anchored at opposite poles by inflated (self-aggrandizing) versus collapsed (self-abnegating) VSIRO, with a balanced (egalitarian) VSIRO, characterized by accountability and forbearance, as the target position. The circumplex model delineates four problematic couple configurations?a dejected couple, a taker?enabler couple, an ultimate fighting couple, and a debtor?collector couple. Where problematic engagement occurs, therapists need to reshape couple engagement toward the balanced, egalitarian position prior to relational trauma work. Clinical vignettes depict these couples and springboard an analysis of unique needs and interventions associated with each couple configuration. Reshaping couple patterns of engagement using a circumplex model of couple configurations is an essential prerequisite to effective and ethical relational trauma work.

AB  - Abstract Objective At present little information is available to help define whether a certain degree of pelvic organ prolapse is clinically relevant. We performed a retrospective study to define cut-offs for significant pelvic organ descent on the basis of prolapse symptoms. Methods At a tertiary urogynecological center, 735 women with symptoms of lower urinary tract dysfunction and prolapse were seen for interview, clinical examination, multi-channel urodynamics and ultrasound imaging, while supine and after voiding, for prolapse quantification. Women with multi-compartment prolapse, i.e. those in whom no compartment was clearly dominant were excluded. Receiver?operator statistics were used to test pelvic organ descent as a predictor of prolapse symptoms. Results Mean age was 55.1 years, mean parity 2.8 (range, 0?12). Symptoms of prolapse were reported by 188 women (25.6%). Seventy-four showed a symptomatic multi-compartment prolapse and were excluded, 56 symptomatic women had cystoceles and 48 had rectoceles. Symptomatic cystoceles descended on average to 23.8 mm below the symphysis pubis and symptomatic rectoceles to 21.4 mm below the symphysis pubis. Descent was strongly associated with symptoms of prolapse (both, P < 0.001). Receiver?operating characteristics (ROC) statistics suggested a cut-off of 10 mm below the symphysis pubis for cystocele, and 15 mm below the symphysis pubis for rectocele. ROC curves were similar for both compartments (area under the curve, 0.857 and 0.821, respectively). Conclusions Descent of the bladder to ≥ 10 mm and of the rectum to ≥ 15 mm below the symphysis pubis are strongly associated with symptoms, and these values are proposed as cut-offs for the diagnosis of significant prolapse on the basis of ROC statistics.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study The suspensory apparatus of the distal phalanx (SADP) is functionally and clinically important. Objectives To investigate SADP form and function and the microanatomy of its insertion zone. Study design Descriptive gross and microanatomy. Methods The feet of 6 normal Standardbred horses were sectioned into blocks along the traditional perpendicular transverse axis and along functional axes of the SADP, decalcified and processed for staining with haematoxylin and eosin, Jones' periodic acid silver methenamine or Masson's trichrome stains. Results In traditional midline toe transverse plane sections SADP collagen bundles were irregular with an unstructured appearance. In sections made transversely along planes (70° and 30°) aligned with the long axis of the SADP, collagen bundles were arranged in linear rows. The linear bundles were continuous from their origin on parietal ridges of the distal phalanx through to the secondary epidermal lamellar basement membrane. At the parietal ridge interface the collagen bundles coalesced into smaller, strongly silver staining, linear structures that penetrated the cortical bone and merged with adjacent osteons. In proximal sagittal sections collagen bundles were also linear, angled at 70° to the ground surface. In distal sagittal sections collagen bundles were also arranged linearly but in a multi-angled, ?spokes of a wheel? arrangement, centred on the distal phalanx apex. Conclusions Sectioning along functional axes demonstrated the true suspensory nature of the SADP connecting the parietal surface to the lamellar hoof wall. SADP/distal phalanx insertions showed penetrating fibres extending through the chondral?apophyseal interface up to and between distal phalanx osteons. Lamellar measurements made from sections perpendicular to the dorsal aspect of the distal phalanx are underestimations but if made along the longer, functional midline 70° transverse plane would accurately reflect the suspensory function of the lamellae. Laminitis pathophysiology correctly viewed as SADP degradation should inform logical, future therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Summary Despite a worldwide need to expand the lung donor pool, approximately 75% of lung offers are not accepted for transplantation. We investigated the impact of liberalizing lung donor acceptance criteria during the last decade on the number of effective transplants and early and late outcomes in our center. All 514 consecutive lung transplants (LTx) performed between Jan 2000 and Oct 2011 were included. Donors were classified as matching standard criteria (SCD; n = 159) or extended criteria (ECD; n = 272) in case they fulfilled at least one of the following criteria: age >55 years, PaO2/FiO2 at PEEP 5 cmH2O < 300 mmHg at time of offer, presence of abnormalities on chest X-ray, smoking history, presence of aspiration, presence of chest trauma, or donation after circulatory death. Outcome parameters were primary graft dysfunction (PGD) grade at 0, 12, 24, and 48 h after LTx, time to extubation, stay in intensive care unit (ICU), early and late infection, acute rejection and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), and survival. Two hundred and seventy-two recipients (63.1%) received ECD lungs. PGD grade at T0 was similar between groups, while at T12 (<0.01), T24 (<0.01), and T48 (<0.05), PGD3 was observed more often in ECDs. ICU stay (P < 0.05) was longer in ECDs compared with SCDs. Time to extubation, respiratory infections, acute rejection, lymphocytic bronchiolitis, BOS, and survival were not different between groups. Accepting ECDs contributed in increasing the number of lung transplants performed in our center. Although this lung donor strategy has an impact on early postoperative outcome, liberalizing criteria did not influence long-term outcome after LTx.

This chapter focuses on the complex matters and provides some guidance about developing or selecting strategies for change and ensuring they match the characteristics of the innovation, target groups and setting to create the most effective intervention possible. Systematic and rigorous methods are needed to enhance the linkage between identified barriers and change strategies. The chapter explores several of such methods. In order to select the best strategy for the change at hand, it is recommended to supplement the problem analyses with the use of scientific literature on effective change in patient care.

AB  - ABSTRACT Traumatic odontoid fractures (TOFs) have been described as the most common injury affecting the C-spine in the elderly. Previous studies have identified degenerative changes and bone loss as important predisposing factors. However, their interaction and respective age-adjusted impact needs further clarification. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 5303 patients (aged ≥60 years) admitted to a level I trauma center between January 2008 and January 2016 who underwent CT imaging of the C-spine. Ninety-two patients with TOF and 80 patients with other cervical spine fractures (OCSF) were identified and a respective 3:1 age- and sex-matched control group without fractures after trauma was built. In all groups, cervical bone mineral density (cBMD) was determined using phantom calibration, and degenerative changes were evaluated in a qualitative manner. In all groups, the severity of degenerative changes of the C-spine increased with age (all p <?0.05) and was inversely correlated with cBMD (all p < 0.05). cBMD was the only significant predictor of a TOF in a multivariate logistic regression model (adjusted odds ratio [OR]?=?3.066, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.432?6.563 for cervical osteoporosis). An association between odontoid cysts and TOF reached significance only in Anderson and D'Alonzo (A 95% CI 1.012?1.890). Patients with OCSFs, compared with patients with TOFs, were younger (median 74 versus 83 years) and had a higher cBMD (median 208?mg/mL versus 172?mg/mL). No differences were observable when comparing cBMD and grades of degenerative changes between OCSFs and their control group (all p >0.1). Decreased cBMD is the major predisposing factor for the occurrence of TOF but not for OCSF in the elderly. The severity of odontoid cysts was found to be a cBMD-independent factor associated with A&D type II TOFs. However, degenerative changes in the odontoid neighboring joints seem to be an epiphenomenon of bone loss and older age but do not independently predispose for TOF. ? 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

AB  - To determine whether there are clinical and epidemiological differences between familial and non-familial Alzheimer's disease, we studied 151 patients with the clinical diagnosis of Dementia of the Alzheimer Type (DAT). Eighty-four index patients (56%) had at least one relative with reported DAT-type memory loss; the remaining 67 did not. For comparison, patients with a positive family history were grouped into a suspected familial DAT (FDAT), and those with a negative family history were grouped into a suspected non-familial DAT (NFDAT). There were no significant differences between FDAT and NFDAT patients with respect to age of symptom onset, survival time, rate of cognitive decline, motor function, behavioral signs or symptoms, head trauma, thyroid dysfunction, maternal age, or birth order. There were no significant differences between pedigrees of FDAT and NFDAT patients in respect to the prevalence of Down's syndrome or age of mortality. To examine a more ?familial? set of FDAT patients, an FDAT subgroup (F2DAT) consisting of 33 index patients with two or more affected relatives with DAT-type memory loss was compared to the 67 NFDAT patients in a similar analysis. No significant differences were found. However, NFDAT index patients had a higher reported prevalence of head trauma than those patients in the F2DAT subgroup (NFDAT 22%, F2DAT 7%, OR = 4.2, CI = 0.9?20.0, P = 0.08). Thus severe head trauma may be a more important etiological factor in the non-familial form of DAT. To better examine this tendency, future studies should be conducted utilizing a larger number of pedigrees and familial criteria which account for the number of persons at risk and the age at onset of disease.

AB  - Background Outcome expectancy, or the degree to which a client believes that therapy will result in improvement, is related to improved treatment outcomes for multiple disorders. There is a paucity of research investigating this relation in regards to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Additionally, the bulk of the research on outcome expectancy and treatment outcomes has relied mostly on self-report outcome measures. Methods The relation between outcome expectancy on self-report measures, clinician-rated measures, and two biological indices (fear-potentiated startle and cortisol reactivity) of PTSD symptoms was explored. The sample included combat veterans (N = 116) treated with virtual reality exposure therapy for PTSD. Results Results supported a negative association between outcome expectancy and both self-report and clinician-rated symptoms at the conclusion of treatment, but outcome expectancy was related to the magnitude of change during treatment for self-report measures only. Outcome expectancy was unrelated to biological measures of treatment response. Conclusions These findings suggest that outcome expectancy may be related to patient and clinician perceptions of outcomes, but not biological indices of outcome for PTSD.

AB  - ABSTRACT The goals of this work were to characterize progression of osteoarthritic cartilage degeneration in a rabbit medial meniscus destabilization (MMD) model and then to use the model to identify pre-histologic disruptions in chondrocyte metabolism under chronically elevated joint contact stresses in vivo. To characterize PTOA progression, 24 rabbits received either MMD or sham surgery. Limb loading was analyzed preoperatively and at regular postoperative intervals using a Tekscan pressure-sensitive walkway. Animals were euthanized 8 (n?=?8 MMD; n?=?8 sham) or 26 weeks (n?=?8 MMD) postoperatively for histological cartilage evaluation by an objective, semi-automated Mankin scoring routine. To examine pre-histologic pathology, MMD was performed on an additional 20 rabbits, euthanized 1 (n?=?9) or 4 weeks (n?=?10) postoperatively. Chondrocytes were harvested fresh for measurement of mitochondrial function, an intracellular indicator of pathology after mechanical injury. Both MMD and sham surgery caused slight decreases in limb loading which returned to preoperative levels after 2 weeks. Histologically apparent cartilage damage progressed from 8 to 26 weeks after MMD. Changes in chondrocyte respiration were variable at 1 week, but by 4 weeks postoperatively chondrocyte mitochondrial function was significantly reduced. Many human injuries that lead to PTOA are relatively mild, and the cell-level mechanisms leading to disease remain unclear. We have documented PTOA progression in an animal model of subtle joint injury under continued use, and demonstrated that this model provides a realistic environment for investigation of multi-stage cellular pathology that develops prior to overt tissue degeneration and which could be targeted for disease modifying treatments. ? 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To describe demographic factors, treatments, and outcomes associated with shoulder instability in dogs. Study Design Multi-center, retrospective cohort study. Animals Dog (n?=?130) with shoulder instability. Methods Medical records (October 2007?2010) from 4 hospitals of dogs with shoulder instability were reviewed to document age, breed, weight, and gender, categorize them into diagnosis cohorts of medial (MSI), lateral (LSI), or multidirectional (MDI) instability, determine treatments, and document outcomes. Treatment cohorts were defined as nonsurgical management, radiofrequency-induced thermal capsulorrhaphy (RITC), or shoulder reconstruction. Outcomes based upon clinician reevaluation and owner input >1 year after diagnosis were used to determine success, failure, and complication rates. Results Most dogs were diagnosed with MSI, but 23% had LSI or MDI. Dogs with MSI treated by reconstruction were more likely than dogs treated without surgery to have a successful outcome (odd's ratio?=?3.0; P?=?.01). Similarly, treatment of MDI with reconstruction was more likely to be associated with a successful outcome than nonsurgical management (odd's ratio?=?5.0; P?=?.007). Success with surgical and nonsurgical management was equivocal between LSI treatment cohorts, but the number of dogs with LSI was small. Complication rates for all treatment cohorts were <10%. Conclusions In dogs with shoulder instability, LSI and MDI are less common than MSI. Surgical reconstruction for treatment of MSI and MDI appears to produce a higher likelihood of achieving successful outcomes than nonsurgical management and surgical complication rates were low but these conclusions are tempered by the limitations of the study.

AB  - Abstract The Wildlife Conservation Society's Bronx Zoo has been housing and breeding slender-tailed cloud rats (Phleomys pallidus) since 1985. Records of 82 animals from 1985 to 2013 were reviewed for this study. The animals were kept successfully in small family groups with a single adult male, multiple adult females, and their offspring. Sexual maturity was noted at approximately 2 years of age and gestation length ranged from 52 to 55 days. Animals were fed a diet including a complete commercial pelleted feed, mixed greens, carrot or yam, mixed hard nuts, and locally sourced browse. Medical conditions requiring treatment in neonates were often fatal whereas most medical conditions in adults were survivable. The most common cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates was maternal neglect or trauma (42%, 5/12 antemortem problems; cause of death in 32%, 8/25). The most significant problems in adults were cryptococcal pneumonia and trauma. Cryptococcus sp. was the cause of death in 11 cases (34%, 11/32) and significant comorbidity in an additional three cases. Treatment with antifungal medications was attempted but was unsuccessful in four cases. Many cases of trauma were treated successfully with conservative management or limited intervention. In four cases, treatment was complicated by extensive self-mutilation after surgical repair of traumatic lesions, which resulted in death or euthanasia. Lymphoplasmacytic thyroiditis was a common postmortem finding in adults (95%, 21/22 for which the thyroid gland was examined histologically). It is unclear if thyroiditis resulted in functional hypothyroidism so the significance of this finding is undetermined.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aim? A major problem in assessing the true public health impact of drug-use on driving and overall traffic safety is that the variables being measured across studies vary significantly. In studies reported in a growing global literature, basic parameters assessed, analytical techniques and drugs tested are simply not comparable due to lack of standardization in the field. These shortcomings severely limit the value of this research to add knowledge to the field. A set of standards to harmonize research findings is sorely needed. This project was initiated by several international organizations to develop guidelines for research on drugged driving. Methods? A September 2006 meeting of international experts discussed the harmonization of protocols for future research on drugged driving. The principal objective of the meeting was to develop a consensus report setting guidelines, standards, core data variables and other controls that would form the basis for future international research. A modified Delphi method was utilized to develop draft guidelines. Subsequently, these draft guidelines were posted on the internet for global review, and comments received were integrated into the final document. Results? The Guidelines Document is divided into three major sections, each focusing upon different aspects of drugged driving research (e.g. roadside surveys, prevalence studies, hospital studies, fatality and crash investigations, etc.) within the critical issue areas of ?behavior?, ?epidemiology? and ?toxicology?. The behavioral section contains 32 specific recommendations; (2) epidemiology 40 recommendations; and (3) toxicology 64 recommendations. Conclusions? It is anticipated that these guidelines will improve significantly the overall quality of drugged driving research and facilitate future cross-study comparisons nationally and globally.

AB  - Abstract Bleeding related to portal hypertension and coagulopathy is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis. Complications and management of bleeding is a significant source of healthcare cost and utilization, as well as morbidity and mortality. Due to the scarcity of evidence surrounding transfusion strategies and hemostatic interventions in patients with cirrhosis, there has been significant debate regarding the best practice. Emerging data suggest that evidence supporting transfusion of packed red blood cells to a hemoglobin threshold of 7-8 g/dL is strong. thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonists have shown promise in increasing platelet levels and reducing transfusions preprocedurally, although have not specifically been found to reduce bleeding risk. Data for viscoelastic testing (VET)-guided transfusions appear favorable for reducing blood transfusion requirements prior to minor procedures and during orthotopic liver transplantation. Hemostatic agents such as recombinant factor VIIa, prothrombin complex concentrates, and tranexamic acid have been examined but their role in cirrhotic patients is unclear. Other areas of growing interest include balanced ratio and whole blood transfusion. In the following manuscript, we summarize the most up to date evidence for threshold-guided, VET-guided, balanced-ratio, and whole blood transfusions as well as the use of hemostatic agents in cirrhotic patients to provide practice guidance to clinicians.

AB  - Stretching is commonly practiced before sports participation; however, effects on subsequent performance and injury prevention are not well understood. There is an abundance of literature demonstrating that a single bout of stretching acutely impairs muscle strength, with a lesser effect on power. The extent to which these effects are apparent when stretching is combined with other aspects of a pre-participation warm-up, such as practice drills and low intensity dynamic exercises, is not known. With respect to the effect of pre-participation stretching on injury prevention a limited number of studies of varying quality have shown mixed results. A general consensus is that stretching in addition to warm-up does not affect the incidence of overuse injuries. There is evidence that pre-participation stretching reduces the incidence of muscle strains but there is clearly a need for further work. Future prospective randomized studies should use stretching interventions that are effective at decreasing passive resistance to stretch and assess effects on subsequent injury incidence in sports with a high prevalence of muscle strains.

AB  - Abstract We examined, first, the relations between children's exposure to military violence and their aggressive behavior and the role of age and gender in that relation in two Palestinian samples. Second, we tested parenting practices as a moderator of the relation between exposure to military violence and aggressive behavior, and third, whether exposure to military violence of different nature (direct victimization versus witnessing) has specific associations with different forms of aggression (reactive, proactive and aggression-enjoyment). Study I was conducted in a relatively calm military-political atmosphere in Palestine-Gaza, and included 640 children, aged 6?16 years whose parents (N=622) and teachers (N=457) provided reports. Older children (≥12 years) provided self-reports (N=211). Study II included 225 Palestinian children aged 10?14-year, who participated during a high-violence period of the Al Aqsa Intifada characterized by air raids, killing and destruction. Results showed that witnessing severe military violence was associated with children's aggressive and antisocial behavior (parent-reported) in study I, and with proactive, reactive and aggression-enjoyment (child-reported) in the study II. As hypothesized, good and supporting parenting practices could moderate the link between exposure to military violence and aggressive behavior. Aggr. Behav. 34:231?244, 2008. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Adult survivors of institutional abuse were interviewed with a comprehensive assessment protocol which included the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Institutional Child Abuse Processes and Coping Inventory, the Structured Clinical Interviews for Disorders of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV axis I disorders and personality disorders, the Trauma Symptoms Inventory, a Life Problems Checklist, the Experiences in Close Relationships Inventory and the Kansas Marital Satisfaction Scale. Profiles were identified for subgroups that described severe sexual (N = 60), physical (N = 102), or emotional (N = 85) abuse as their worst forms of maltreatment. Survivors of severe sexual abuse had the most abnormal profile, which was characterised by higher rates of all forms of child maltreatment and higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol and substance abuse, antisocial personality disorder, trauma symptoms and life problems. Survivors of severe emotional abuse were better adjusted than the other two groups. The profile of survivors of severe physical abuse occupied an intermediate position between the other two groups. A thorough assessment of abuse history and current functioning should be conducted when providing services to adult survivors of institutional abuse, since this may have important implications for the intensity of services required. Survivors of severe sexual abuse may require more intensive services. Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Little is known about hearing impairment in patients after organ transplantation. We conducted a single-center study to evaluate hearing impairment in patients after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). A questionnaire was sent to 695 adult patients after OLT to assess characteristics and course of auditory impairment. Risk factors such as ototoxic drugs were taken into consideration. Clinical follow-up, including immunosuppressive therapy, was analyzed in detail. The questionnaire was completed by 521 patients (75%). Hearing impairment was reported by 184 patients (35%). A total of 43 patients (8%) suffered from hearing abnormalities prior to OLT. The remaining 141 patients (27%) developed hearing impairment after transplantation. Main problems were hearing loss (52%), tinnitus (38%), and otalgia (30%). There was no association of post-OLT hearing disorders with age or known risk factors. In 43% of patients, onset of hearing impairment was within 2 yr post-OLT. Hearing loss was positively associated with tacrolimus immunosuppression in univariate (P < 0.05) and multivariate analysis (P < 0.02). Patients using a hearing aid received tacrolimus more frequently than cyclosporine (P < 0.05). In conclusion, subjective hearing impairment is frequent in patients after OLT and contributes to post-OLT morbidity. Calcineurin inhibitor-related neurotoxicity appears as a possible mechanism. Further prospective investigations with objective hearing tests are necessary to confirm these results and to evaluate the role of immunosuppression. Liver Transpl, 2006. ? 2006 AASLD.
