AB  - Lymphoma is reported to be the most common nasal and second most common intracranial neoplasm in cats. Intracranial lymphoma may occur as a primary central nervous system lymphoma or as part of multi-centric disease. Two cats were presented with histopathologically confirmed nasopharyngeal lymphoma and concurrent mass within the middle fossa of the cranial cavity, with magnetic resonance imaging suggestive of direct communication. Both cats demonstrated evidence of bilateral oculomotor nerve deficits and upper respiratory tract noise. In one cat, bilateral optic nerve deficits were also present. The magnetic resonance imaging features were similar in both cases and demonstrated a contrast-enhancing intracranial mass on the ventral aspect of the middle fossa of the cranial cavity and an adjacent mass arising from the dorsal aspect of the nasopharynx. Lymphoma should be included as an important differential diagnosis in cats presented with middle cranial fossa syndrome (in particular ophthalmoplegia) and stertor.

AB  - Abstract Background The use of grafts from donors with hypertension (HTN) in liver transplantation has grown rapidly recently, but whether HTN donors affect post-liver transplantation survival is unclear. Methods We used data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database (2004?2008), and evaluated differences in baseline characteristics and outcomes between recipients of grafts from HTN and non-HTN donors. Kaplan?Meier and multivariate Cox regression models were used in assessing patient survival. Results We identified 8,411 recipients of HTN donor grafts (33.2%) and 16,891 (66.8%) recipients of non-HTN donor grafts. Graft and patient survival rates were significantly lower in recipients of HTN donor grafts versus non-HTN donor grafts (1-year, 3-year, and 5-year graft survival rates of 75%, 64%, 50% vs. 80%, 72%, 62% [P < 0.001], respectively, and patient survival rates of 79%, 69%, 56% vs. 83%, 75%, 65% [P < 0.001], respectively). A history of HTN >5 years was also associated with lower rates of graft and patient survival (P < 0.001). A HTN donor was independently associated with a higher risk of graft loss (hazard ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval 1.01?1.18). Conclusion The present study shows that graft and patient survivals were lower in recipients of hypertensive donor grafts, and highlights the importance of appropriately screening donors for HTN.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: A 70% increase in graduating interns is projected in Australia from 2007 to 2012. Emergency medicine is a key term in the intern year. There is little information on the preparedness of EDs for this increase, and what resources will be required. Methods: Semistructured telephone interview to senior and junior ED medical staff nationwide with graded responses using a Likert scale or ordinal multi-category scales to enable quantitative analysis. Results: 36 of 37 targeted hospitals were surveyed. 95 of 233 (40.1%) potential interviews were completed, including 61/61 (100%) of ED Directors. Communications systems and human resource adjustments were felt to be critical, including more supervisory staff and more time dedicated for senior medical staff to supervise. Thematic analysis confirmed the priorities were staffing and infrastructure requirements. Discussion: We recommend attention to ED communications infrastructure, an increase in rostered supervisory time for senior ED medical staff, and the provision of additional ED medical educators to teach interns.

AB  - Objective To document the most common types of bacteria isolated from the canine larynx and to compare isolates, degree of growth and susceptibility patterns between dogs with laryngeal paralysis and dogs with normal laryngeal function. Methods Laryngeal swabs were collected from each patient and submitted for bacterial culture and susceptibility testing. Dogs with laryngeal paralysis (n=23) underwent a unilateral arytenoid lateralisation and control dogs (n=24) underwent an elective orthopaedic procedure. Results of the cultures were compared between groups. Results Bacterial organisms isolated from the larynx were similar to those normally found in the oropharynx, trachea and lungs. The most common bacteria isolated from the larynges of all dogs were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species and Pasteurella species. Pure colonies were more commonly seen in dogs with laryngeal paralysis while mixed colonies were more commonly seen in control dogs. Antimicrobial resistance was similar between study and control dogs. Clinical Significance The laryngeal flora appears to contain bacteria that are commonly isolated from the oropharynx, trachea and lungs. Differences in antimicrobial susceptibility were not identified between study and control dogs.

AB  - Abstract Adult survivors of institutional abuse were interviewed with a comprehensive assessment protocol which included the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Institutional Child Abuse Processes and Coping Inventory, the Structured Clinical Interviews for Disorders of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV axis I disorders and personality disorders, the Trauma Symptoms Inventory, a Life Problems Checklist, the Experiences in Close Relationships Inventory and the Kansas Marital Satisfaction Scale. Profiles were identified for subgroups that described severe sexual (N = 60), physical (N = 102), or emotional (N = 85) abuse as their worst forms of maltreatment. Survivors of severe sexual abuse had the most abnormal profile, which was characterised by higher rates of all forms of child maltreatment and higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol and substance abuse, antisocial personality disorder, trauma symptoms and life problems. Survivors of severe emotional abuse were better adjusted than the other two groups. The profile of survivors of severe physical abuse occupied an intermediate position between the other two groups. A thorough assessment of abuse history and current functioning should be conducted when providing services to adult survivors of institutional abuse, since this may have important implications for the intensity of services required. Survivors of severe sexual abuse may require more intensive services. Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Hamstring injuries remain a significant burden in sports that involve high-speed running. In elite male football, hamstring injury has repeatedly been identified as the most common non-contact injury, representing 12% of all injuries. As the incidence remains high, investigations are aimed at better understanding how to improve prevention efforts. Intrinsic risk factors such as strength have been investigated extensively in a cohort of professional football players; however, other intrinsic measures of neuromuscular function have not been studied in this cohort. This study aims to investigate the association between timing of hamstring muscle activity onset and the rate of torque development during the early phase of isokinetic strength testing with risk of hamstring injury in professional football players in a prospective cohort study. All teams (n = 18) eligible to compete in the premier football league in Qatar underwent a comprehensive strength assessment during their annual periodic health evaluation at Aspetar Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital in Doha, Qatar. Variables included rate of torque development and timing of muscle activity onset. A total of 367 unique players (60.6% of all QSL players) competed for 514 player seasons (103 players competed both seasons) and sustained 65 hamstring injuries. There was no difference in the onset of muscle activity between the biceps femoris and medial hamstrings comparing the injured to uninjured players. For both onset of muscle activity and rate of torque development, there were no significant differences between any of the variables (P > .05), with small effect sizes detected across all the different variables (d < 0.3). Rate of torque development and onset of muscle activity were not associated with a risk of future hamstring injury. The use of these measures as part of a periodic health evaluation to identify risk of hamstring injury is unsupported.

AB  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE 2011; 18:1081?1089 ? 2011 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine Abstract Objectives:? The objective was to critically appraise and highlight medical education research studies published in 2010 that were methodologically superior and whose outcomes were pertinent to teaching and education in emergency medicine (EM). Methods:? A search of the English language literature in 2010 querying PubMed, Scopus, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), and PsychInfo identified 41 EM studies that used hypothesis-testing or observational investigations of educational interventions. Five reviewers independently ranked all publications based on 10 criteria, including four related to methodology, that were chosen a priori to standardize evaluation by reviewers. This method was used previously to appraise medical education published in 2008 and 2009. Results:? Five medical education research studies met the a priori criteria for inclusion and are reviewed and summarized here. Comparing the literature of 2010 to 2008 and 2009, the number of published educational research papers increased from 30 to 36 and then to 41. The number of funded studies remained fairly stable over the past 3?years at 13 (2008), 16 (2009), and 9 (2010). As in past?years, research involving the use of technology accounted for a significant number of publications (34%), including three of the five highlighted studies. Conclusions:? Forty-one EM educational studies published in 2010 were identified. This critical appraisal reviews and highlights five studies that met a priori quality indicators. Current trends and common methodologic pitfalls in the 2010 papers are noted.

Abstract Aim: The aim of the study was to assess possible risk indicators for peri-implantitis at different levels of severity using multi-level analyses. Material and Methods: One hundred and nine subjects attended the examination, 69 females and 40 males. Mean time of implants in function was 8.4 years (standard deviation 4.6) (subject level). The participants were examined clinically and radiographically. Information regarding general health and habits was gathered, with special emphasis on smoking, oral hygiene and susceptibility to periodontitis. The relation between possible risk indicators and the following features were assessed:?? Detectable peri-implantitis: detectable radiographic bone loss (>0.4?mm) and inflammation?? Overt peri-implantitis: radiographic peri-implant bone loss 2.0?mm and bleeding on probing /suppuration at pocket probing depth 4?mm. Results: Multi-level statistical analyses identified location in the maxilla as risk indicator for detectable peri-implantitis. Regarding overt peri-implantitis, gender (male) and history of periodontitis were identified as risk indicators. Conclusion: Individuals with a history of periodontitis were prone to peri-implantitis, peri-implant bone loss?≥2.0?mm and overt in the present study. No association was found between smoking and peri-implant disease in the present study population.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To report the anatomical pattern and etiological spectrum of uveitis in an urban multi-ethnic population from Barcelona, Spain. General and specific epidemiological data for the most prevalent aetiologies are also calculated. Methods A cross-sectional study of consecutive uveitis cases was performed between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2012. Exogenous endophthalmitis, surgery-related, post-traumatic and toxic uveitis along with masquerade syndromes were excluded. Anatomical (Standard Uveitis Nomenclature criteria) and aetiological patterns (by tailored tests), age, sex, geographical origin and laterality were analysed. Mean incidence and prevalence were calculated for a mid-period reference population. Results From 1022 patients included, 52% were anterior uveitis (AU), 23% posterior, 15% panuveitis and 9% intermediate uveitis. Aetiologically, 26% were unclassifiable, 29% infectious, 25% associated with systemic immune diseases, and 20% corresponded to ocular-specific syndromes. Among classified causes, herpesvirus (12%), toxoplasma (7%), Behçet's disease (BD) (5%), HLA-B27-isolated AU (5%), ankylosing spondylitis (5%), tuberculosis-related uveitis (TRU) (5%), birdshot chorioretinopathy (3%) and sarcoidosis (3%) were the most frequent. Non-Spanish origin was recorded in 22%, with 47% of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada and 36% of toxoplasma cases coming from South America, 10% of BD and 11% of TRU from Africa and 24% of TRU cases from Asia. A mean annual incidence of 51.91 cases/100 000 inhabitants was found for the referral population. Conclusion In our referral area, 74% of the uveitis cases can be correctly classified. A large myriad of uveitis aetiologies with a strong geographical origin burden are found in Western urban multi-ethnic populations.

AB  - Background Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) commonly experience both reduced quality of life (QOL) and olfactory dysfunction (OD). Literature on the impacts of appropriate medical therapy (AMT) for CRS on QOL and OD is limited, and the focused design of these studies may limit their applicability to usual clinical practice. Methods Adults with symptomatic CRS were prospectively enrolled (November 2016 to October 2018) into an observational, multi-institutional study. Individualized AMT was initiated using standard practice according to evidence-based guidelines. Endoscopy examination (Lund-Kennedy), olfactory function (Sniffin? Sticks) testing, and QOL survey responses (22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test [SNOT-22], Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders?Negative Statements [QOD-NS]) were obtained at enrollment and follow-up. Results Baseline measures demonstrated heterogeneity of QOL and OD. After an average of 7.8 weeks, within-subject median SNOT-22 total improved by 39.5% (n = 39, p < 0.001) relative to baseline, including 50% (p = 0.014) improvement for item #21, ?Sense of smell/taste.? QOD-NS improvement was also statistically significant (p = 0.044). Sniffin? Sticks score relative improvement of 10.9% (n = 33, p = 0.109) was not statistically significant and lacked correlation with SNOT-22 total scores (R = ?0.247, p = 0.165) or QOD-NS total scores (R = ?0.016, p = 0.930), but correlated moderately with endoscopy score (R = ?0.436, p = 0.018). Conclusions Participants with varied impacts of CRS, treated with individualized short-term AMT, demonstrated significant improvements in CRS- and olfactory-specific QOL measures, without corresponding improvement in clinically measured olfactory function. Olfactory function changes moderately correlated with endoscopy score changes, but lacked an association with QOL measurements.

AB  - Flaring of the ischiopubic synchondrosis at the time of fusion is a common clinical observation in pediatrics and represents a normal physiological process in skeletal maturation. When presenting unilaterally, this flaring can mimic a range of serious pathological conditions such as osteomyelitis, osteal tumors, and traumatic injury. An improved understanding of ischiopubic synchondrosis fusion is therefore critical to avoid potential misdiagnosis. Retrospective multi-slice computed tomography pelvic scans of Australian individuals aged neonate to 24?years (n?=?184) were assessed using a novel five stage morphological classification system of the maturation and fusion of the ischiopubic synchondrosis. Maturation scoring was conducted using both multiplanar formatting views and volume-rendered reconstructions in OsiriX?. Maturational stage was strongly related to age (P?<?0.001) with fusion of the ischiopubic synchondrosis observed between the ages of 4 and 9 years in females and 7 and 13?years for males. The highest probability of fusion in our Queensland Australian population based on multinomial regression predictive modeling was between 7 and 10 years of age. We documented three variants of fusion: pubic and ischial outgrowths, appearance of a secondary ossification center, and a fusiform-shaped enlargement. This study provides the first predictive modeling of the timing of fusion of the ischiopubic synchondrosis using a reliable morphological classification system. The significant variation in timing and progression of fusion of the ischiopubic synchondrosis reported in this study, will aid in minimizing misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment in children presenting with asymmetrical or delayed ischiopubic synchondrosis anomalies.

AB  - An 18-month-old European shorthair cat was presented with a two week history of progressive decrease in consciousness, ambulatory tetraparesis, moderate ataxia and generalised decreased-to-absent postural reactions. Bilateral facial and nasal hypalgesia, absent menace response and anisocoria were found, and segmental spinal reflexes were normal. Neurological signs progressed to non-ambulatory tetraparesis, tremor and spinal hyperalgesia. Histopathological examination revealed a mild-to-moderate lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic infiltration, predominantly in the dorsal spinal roots, cranial nerves and ganglia in association with marked demyelination and proliferation of Schwann cells. Neurons and axons were preserved. Lesions were multi-focal and varied in severity. A predominantly sensory polyganglioradiculoneuritis was diagnosed. This lesion has not been reported previously in cats. Rabies, herpesviruses, feline infectious peritonitis, feline immunodeficiency virus, Toxoplasma gondii and feline leukaemia virus were excluded as possible aetiologies. Infections by other viruses or an autoimmune disease are discussed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Ankle fractures are among the most common lower limb fractures. Associations between postoperative radiographic results and clinical outcome have been found, but less is known about the relevant ankle biomechanics. This study analyzed ankle kinematics, radiographic findings, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) in patients treated for ankle fractures. The hypothesis was that patients after ankle fracture surgery had less flexion/extension in the ankle compared to healthy subjects and that fracture severity had significant influence on kinematics and patient satisfaction. Thirty-three patients (n?=?33 feet) operated for ankle fractures were recruited. Ankle kinematics were analyzed using the Oxford Foot model, and results were compared with an age-matched healthy control group (11 patients, 20 feet). In addition, patients were divided by fracture (severity) classification and kinematic results were correlated with PROM and radiographic findings. Patients treated for ankle fracture showed lower walking speed (p?<?0.001) when asked to walk in preferred normal speed. When compared at equal speed, significantly less range of motion (ROM) between the hindfoot and tibia in the sagittal plane (flexion/extension) during loading and push-off phases (p?=?0.003 and p?<?0.001) was found in patients after ankle fractures compared to healthy subjects. Lowest ROM and poorest PROM results were found for patients with trimalleolar ankle fractures. There was a significant correlation between ROM (flexion/extension) during the push-off phase and SF-36 physical functioning (r2?=?0.403, p?=?0.027) and SF-36 general health (r2?=?0.473, p?=?0.008). Fracture severity was significantly correlated with flexion/extension ROM in the ankle during both loading and push-off phases (r2?=??0.382, p?=?0.005, and r2?=??0.568, p?<?0.001) and was also significantly correlated with PROM. This study found that patients with ankle fractures had significantly altered ankle kinematics compared to healthy subjects. The poorest results were found among patients with trimalleolar fractures. Weak to strong significant correlations were found between fracture severity, ankle kinematics, and PROM. ? 2019 The Authors. Journal of Orthopaedic Research?

A viable way of expanding the donor pool is the use of liver grafts from hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)?positive donors. The present study used the US Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database (1987-2010), and each of the 78 patients who underwent OLT with HBsAg-positive grafts was matched with 4 patients who received HBsAg-negative grafts by urgent status, donor sex, recipient sex, donor age, recipient age, transplant date, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, and warm ischemia time. The overall graft and patient survival rates were similar for recipients of HBsAg-positive grafts and matched controls: the 5-year graft survival rates were 66% and 64%, respectively (P?=?0.95), and the 5-year patient survival rates were 71% and 71%, respectively (P?=?0.87). A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis that was adjusted for other variables showed no impact of the donor HBsAg status on graft or patient survival. The use of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) was independently associated with better posttransplant graft survival [hazard ratio (HR)?=?0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI)?=?0.06-0.81] and patient survival (HR?=?0.16, 95% CI?=?0.04-0.75) for recipients of HBsAg-positive grafts. In conclusion, the use of HBsAg-positive liver grafts did not reduce posttransplant graft or patient survival. Moreover, matching these donors to recipients treated with HBIG may improve safety.

AB  - One of the more confounding issues in dermatology relates to racial differences in susceptibility of human subjects to skin reactions resulting from chemical or physical trauma. There is some historical evidence to support a greater resistance of Black versus Caucasian populations to skin irritation or skin allergy, likely due to a more substantial barrier to chemical penetration. A heightened sensitivity among Asian subjects (versus Caucasians) has been suggested; however, the evidence published to date is not very compelling. Part of the difficulty has been the lack of concurrent studies. Previously, we had examined the elicitation of mild skin irritation responses to relatively high concentrations of test chemicals, using a novel acute irritation patch test protocol for the assessment of chemical skin irritation potential. Caucasian and Chinese subjects were exposed under patch for up to 4 h to chemicals of varying irritation potency. No significant differences were seen in the cumulative incidence of positive responders to any of the test chemicals across the 2 populations, even when the subjects were preselected for sensitivity to lactic acid stinging. To extend these findings, the focus of the current investigation was to compare directly skin irritation responses between Caucasian subjects and different subpopulations of Asian subjects (Chinese, Japanese) to determine if any significant differences in response patterns would emerge. 2 separate studies were conducted. The initial study compared Caucasian and Japanese subjects for responses to 20% sodium docecyl sulfate (SDS), 10% acetic acid, 100% octanoic acid, 100% decanol, and water. In addition, a concurrent test was conducted comparing 14-day cumulative irritation responses to varying concentrations (0.025% to 0.3%) of SDS. In both the acute and cumulative irritation tests, the Japanese subjects showed a tendency to respond faster than the Caucasian subjects. Significant differences in response were seen at several chemical exposure time points in the acute irritation test, and with the lowest concentration of SDS (0.025%) in the cumulative irritation test. A repeat of this exact study protocol was then conducted among Caucasian, Japanese, and Chinese subjects. In this 2nd study, no differences were seen in the acute or cumulative irritation responses between the Japanese and Caucasian subjects. The Chinese subjects showed a heightened response to 10% acetic acid (after 4 h of exposure), but otherwise displayed a similar response profile in the acute irritation test. They showed a slower and less severe response in the cumulative irritation test compared to the Caucasian or Japanese subjects. These divergent results underscore the difficulty in ascribing true population-based differences in skin reactivity based upon studies in limited subject populations. It may be possible to detect differences in individual studies, but repeat testing may fail to confirm a consistent trend. These findings may be indicative of the wide variation in skin responsiveness across human subjects in general.

AB  - OBJECTIVES:?To determine the individual and combined effects of potential risk factors in relation to the temporomandibular disorder, Pain Dysfunction Syndrome (PDS). DESIGN:?Case?control study. MATERIAL AND METHODS:?Cases were new referrals to the temporomandibular disorder clinic of the University Dental Hospital of Manchester, diagnosed with PDS. Controls were randomly selected from 24 dental practices. Using a postal questionnaire information was collected on socio-demographic, local mechanical, psychological factors, co-morbidities and illness behaviour. The adjusted participation rate was similar in cases and controls (64%), and 131 cases and 196 controls finally participated in the study. RESULTS:?Compared with the controls, the cases were more likely to report that their teeth felt as though they did not fit together properly [odds ratio (OR) 8, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 6?13] and report history of facial trauma (OR 3, 95% CI 2?6). Both diurnal and nocturnal grinding were significantly associated with PDS, and individuals who reported grinding their teeth both during the day and at night had a risk of 6; 95% CI 3?13 for PDS compared with those who did not. A history of orthodontic treatment, having any dentures, having missing teeth, use of chewing gum or biting the fingernails did not show any relationship with PDS. People who took medication for the bowels had a higher risk of PDS (OR 2, 95% CI 1?4). Participants with frequent headaches had a threefold increase in risk of having PDS (OR 3, 95% CI 2?5) while having pain in parts of the body other than the head was associated with an OR of 3 (95% CI 2?5). An increased propensity to have PDS was seen in those individuals with higher levels of psychological distress (OR 3; 95% CI 1?4 in the highest category, test for trend P?<?0.001) and sleep disturbance (OR 5; 95% CI 2?94 in the highest category, test for trend P?<?0.001). Aspects of illness behaviour, such as disease conviction (OR 4; 95% CI 2?9 in the highest category) and perception of illness (0.3; 95% CI 0.2?0.5) were associated with PDS. The result for the denial scale became statistically significant after adjustment for age and gender (2; 95% CI 1?3). CONCLUSIONS:?The current case?control study provides complementary epidemiological information on oro-facial pain (OFP) and supports a multifactorial aetiology of PDS, with factors from many domains, including local mechanical factors, psychological and co-morbidities. People with PDS were characterized by frequent headaches, history of facial trauma, teeth grinding, sleep problems, pain elsewhere in the body and high levels of psychological distress. From the results of current study and available evidence it seems inappropriate to consider PDS in isolation and future research should adopt a multidisciplinary approach to OFP.

AB  - Objective.? The aim of this study was to assess the validity of single-item parental ratings of child oral heath. Methods.? Data were collected during a study to assess the impacts of dental injury. Clinical examinations of children aged 11?14 years were undertaken that included measures of trauma, decay, treatment needs, and fluorosis. Children with trauma and a group of trauma-free children were followed-up. Parents were mailed a questionnaire along with a questionnaire for the child that contained a short form of the Child Perceptions Questionnaire 11?14 (CPQ11?14). Bivariate analyses examined associations between parents? ratings of their child's oral health, measures of dental disease, clinically defined treatment needs, and scores on the CPQ11?14. Logistic regression was used to see if the associations observed remained after controlling for access to dental care variables. Results.? Complete data were collected from 370 children and their parents. Parental ratings showed significant associations with most of the clinical indicators used and CPQ11?14 scores. Similar results were obtained when the data were analysed for subgroups defined by household income and mother's education. These associations remained after controlling for access to dental services. Conclusion.? The data suggest that single-item parental ratings of child oral health have adequate construct validity.

AB  - Objective? To determine whether breed, sex, country of origin, and age are associated with anatomic location of intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (IHPSS) in dogs. Study Design? Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Sample Population? Dogs (n=125) with IHPSS from the veterinary teaching hospitals of the University of Florida (21), Sydney University (44), and the University of California?Davis (60). Methods? Dogs with surgical/necropsy confirmation of single IHPSS were identified. Data were analyzed using logistic regression for associations between age, breed, sex, and country with the anatomic location of IHPSS. Results? Right (34%), left (34%), and central divisional IHPSS (32%) were prevalent with approximately equal frequency in Australia; in the United States, the prevalence of right (24%) and central divisional (26%) combined was similar to left divisional IHPSS (51%). Country (P=048), sex (P=.016), and Australian cattle dog ([ACD], P=.025) were significantly associated with IHPSS location. Dogs in Australia had 2.5-fold higher odds of having right versus left divisional IHPSS. Males and ACD had 2.8- and 5.6-fold higher odds of having right versus left divisional IHPSS. Australian dogs were significantly older than those in the United States (P<.0001) and ACD were significantly older than other breeds (P=.0067). Conclusions? Although country of origin, breed, and sex had significant associations with anatomic location of IHPSS, signalment does not appear to be a strong predictor of shunt location when used alone. Clinical Relevance? For the common breeds in this report, signalment is only occasionally helpful in predicting likelihood of anatomic division in IHPSS. Australian cattle dogs and male dogs have a statistical association with right (versus left) divisional IHPSS. If advanced imaging techniques are not available, veterinary surgeons should be prepared to locate and address any anatomic configuration of IHPSS in a dog.

AB  - SUMMARY Why did peacetime government shares of total spending double in a number of Western economies between 1910 and 1938? The widely separated dates for the introduction of universal manhood suffrage and the evidence of a rise in protection during the inter-war period indicate that neither democracy nor globalization can explain this development. This paper reexamines two other explanations, namely, (1) a shift in the demand for public goods and (2) a war-induced willingness to share with one's fellow citizens. By introducing into Schelling's (1978) Multi-Person Dilemma a learning game whose payoffs change endogenously, we provide theoretical explanations for this transformation. We then test the resulting propositions with data on public spending as a share of GNP for the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Germany and Denmark, from the 1870s to the 1930s. In each case, we find no unit root but a break in trend, a result shown to favor explanation (2) over (1).

AB  - Scand J Caring Sci; 2010; 24; 392?403 ? Adapting the Individualized Care Scale for cross-cultural comparison Rationale:? Cross-cultural comparative studies using reliable and valid instruments can increase awareness of the differences and similarities between health worker?s ability to respond to patients? individual needs within different health systems. This will enable a better understanding of cultural perspectives in individualized nursing care. Aim:? To describe the translation and adaptation process of the Individualized Care Scale (ICS) and examine its reliability and validity in a cross-cultural study. Design:? A cross-sectional comparative study. Settings:? Twenty-seven orthopaedic and trauma in-patient units at 14 hospitals in 5 countries. Participants:? A total of 1126 patients were included in the study: Finland (n?=?425), Greece (n?=?315), Sweden (n?=?218), UK (n?=?135) and USA (n?=?33). Methods:? A systematic forward- and back-translation procedure using bilingual techniques, a committee approach, pretest techniques and pilot testing were used with a convenience sample to produce a valid ICS for each participating group. Psychometric evaluation of the adapted ICS was based on means, SD, missing data analysis, Cronbach?s alpha coefficients and average inter-item correlations. Construct validity was examined using sub-scale correlations to total scales and principal components analysis. Results:? The use of the range of options and the sub-scale mean scores ranging from 2.72 to 4.30 demonstrated the sensitivity of the scale. Cronbach?s alpha coefficients (0.77?0.97) and average inter-item correlations (0.37?0.77) were acceptable. The sub-scale correlations to total scales were high (0.83?0.97). The underlying theoretical construct of the ICS was demonstrated by the explained variances ranging from 58% to 79%. Conclusions:? The ICS shows promise as a tool for evaluating individualized care in European cultures. The international expansion of an existing instrument developed for one country facilitates comparative studies across countries. There is a need to further test the construct validity and appropriateness of the ICS in different settings in European and nonwestern cultures.
