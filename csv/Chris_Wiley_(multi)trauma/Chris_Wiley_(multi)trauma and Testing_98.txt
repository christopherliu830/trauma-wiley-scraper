AB  - Objective.? The aim of this study was to assess the validity of single-item parental ratings of child oral heath. Methods.? Data were collected during a study to assess the impacts of dental injury. Clinical examinations of children aged 11?14 years were undertaken that included measures of trauma, decay, treatment needs, and fluorosis. Children with trauma and a group of trauma-free children were followed-up. Parents were mailed a questionnaire along with a questionnaire for the child that contained a short form of the Child Perceptions Questionnaire 11?14 (CPQ11?14). Bivariate analyses examined associations between parents? ratings of their child's oral health, measures of dental disease, clinically defined treatment needs, and scores on the CPQ11?14. Logistic regression was used to see if the associations observed remained after controlling for access to dental care variables. Results.? Complete data were collected from 370 children and their parents. Parental ratings showed significant associations with most of the clinical indicators used and CPQ11?14 scores. Similar results were obtained when the data were analysed for subgroups defined by household income and mother's education. These associations remained after controlling for access to dental services. Conclusion.? The data suggest that single-item parental ratings of child oral health have adequate construct validity.

AB  - SUMMARY Why did peacetime government shares of total spending double in a number of Western economies between 1910 and 1938? The widely separated dates for the introduction of universal manhood suffrage and the evidence of a rise in protection during the inter-war period indicate that neither democracy nor globalization can explain this development. This paper reexamines two other explanations, namely, (1) a shift in the demand for public goods and (2) a war-induced willingness to share with one's fellow citizens. By introducing into Schelling's (1978) Multi-Person Dilemma a learning game whose payoffs change endogenously, we provide theoretical explanations for this transformation. We then test the resulting propositions with data on public spending as a share of GNP for the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Germany and Denmark, from the 1870s to the 1930s. In each case, we find no unit root but a break in trend, a result shown to favor explanation (2) over (1).

AB  - One of the more confounding issues in dermatology relates to racial differences in susceptibility of human subjects to skin reactions resulting from chemical or physical trauma. There is some historical evidence to support a greater resistance of Black versus Caucasian populations to skin irritation or skin allergy, likely due to a more substantial barrier to chemical penetration. A heightened sensitivity among Asian subjects (versus Caucasians) has been suggested; however, the evidence published to date is not very compelling. Part of the difficulty has been the lack of concurrent studies. Previously, we had examined the elicitation of mild skin irritation responses to relatively high concentrations of test chemicals, using a novel acute irritation patch test protocol for the assessment of chemical skin irritation potential. Caucasian and Chinese subjects were exposed under patch for up to 4 h to chemicals of varying irritation potency. No significant differences were seen in the cumulative incidence of positive responders to any of the test chemicals across the 2 populations, even when the subjects were preselected for sensitivity to lactic acid stinging. To extend these findings, the focus of the current investigation was to compare directly skin irritation responses between Caucasian subjects and different subpopulations of Asian subjects (Chinese, Japanese) to determine if any significant differences in response patterns would emerge. 2 separate studies were conducted. The initial study compared Caucasian and Japanese subjects for responses to 20% sodium docecyl sulfate (SDS), 10% acetic acid, 100% octanoic acid, 100% decanol, and water. In addition, a concurrent test was conducted comparing 14-day cumulative irritation responses to varying concentrations (0.025% to 0.3%) of SDS. In both the acute and cumulative irritation tests, the Japanese subjects showed a tendency to respond faster than the Caucasian subjects. Significant differences in response were seen at several chemical exposure time points in the acute irritation test, and with the lowest concentration of SDS (0.025%) in the cumulative irritation test. A repeat of this exact study protocol was then conducted among Caucasian, Japanese, and Chinese subjects. In this 2nd study, no differences were seen in the acute or cumulative irritation responses between the Japanese and Caucasian subjects. The Chinese subjects showed a heightened response to 10% acetic acid (after 4 h of exposure), but otherwise displayed a similar response profile in the acute irritation test. They showed a slower and less severe response in the cumulative irritation test compared to the Caucasian or Japanese subjects. These divergent results underscore the difficulty in ascribing true population-based differences in skin reactivity based upon studies in limited subject populations. It may be possible to detect differences in individual studies, but repeat testing may fail to confirm a consistent trend. These findings may be indicative of the wide variation in skin responsiveness across human subjects in general.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a progressive disease process underlain by dynamic and interactive biochemical mechanisms; thus, large-scale and unbiased assessments are needed to fully understand its highly complex pathobiology. Here, we report on a new high-capacity label-free proteomic platform to evaluate the post-TBI neuroproteome. Six orthogonal separation stages and data-independent MS were employed, affording reproducible quantitative assessment on 18 651 peptides across biological replicates. From these data 3587 peptides were statistically responsive to TBI of which 18% were post-translationally modified. Results revealed as many as 484 proteins in the post-TBI neuroproteome, which was fully nine times the number determined from our prior study of focal cortical injury. Yet, these data were generated using 25 times less brain tissue per animal relative to former methodology, permitting greater anatomical specificity and proper biological replication for increased statistical power. Exemplified by these data, we discuss benefits of peptide-centric differential analysis to more accurately infer novel biological findings testable in future hypothesis-driven research. The high-capacity label-free proteomic platform is designed for multi-factor studies aimed at expanding our knowledge on the molecular underpinnings of TBI and to develop better diagnostics and therapeutics.

AB  - Summary Background Skincare cosmeceutical products have been shown to address intrinsic and extrinsic skin aging. Radiofrequency (RF) with microneedling is effective and safe in improving skin laxity and texture. Pairing skincare cosmeceutical products pre- and post-procedure is beneficial as it enhances patient results, patient results, patient experience, and reduces patient downtime. Objective To evaluate the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of a multi-ingredient anti-aging facial moisturizer when applied pre- and post-procedure consisting of a single RF microneedling treatment. Method Fifteen female patients, aged 37-60, Fitzpatrick skin types I-IV, with mild-to-moderate wrinkles were included in the study. Patients applied a multi-ingredient anti-aging facial moisturizer twice a day (morning and night) two weeks prior to RF microneedling and four weeks post-RF microneedling (twice a day). At each time point, investigator objective assessment, self-assessments, and clinical photography were taken. Result There were no adverse events as evaluated by the investigator. For this combined treatment and procedure patient scored comfort as the highest for satisfaction. Tolerability parameters erythema and edema were reported after RF microneedling treatment and were significant compared to the pre-procedure timepoint. Eighty percent of patients showed an improvement in Glogau Wrinkle Scale, but improvement was not statistically significant between baseline and end of study. Improvements in all skin attributes (radiance, tone, smoothness, texture, redness, dryness, and overall appearance) were statistically significant at the end of the study. Self-perceived skin attribute improvements included overall improvement, brightness, texture, pigmentation, redness, and tightness. The combination of the anti-aging facial moisturizer and RF microneedling was recommended by the patients in this study. Conclusion This clinical study positively supports the hypothesis that combining the multi-ingredient anti-aging facial moisturizer pre- and post-RF microneedling was safe and tolerable for the patients.

AB  - Objective Evaluate the effects of supplemental fixation elements on the mechanical properties of a single ring circular fixator construct. Study Design In vitro mechanical testing. Sample population: Five construct configurations (six replicates of each configuration) were used to stabilize a 1.6 cm diameter Delrin rod bone model. Methods Constructs were assembled using 66 mm complete rings, 1.6 mm olive wires, and 3.2 mm diameter half-pins. Construct configurations tested were a base single ring construct, constructs with 1 supplemental drop wire or constructs with 1, 2, or 3 supplemental half-pins. Constructs were loaded in axial compression, caudocranial and mediolateral bending, and torsion. Strain was measured in individual fixation elements during axial loading. Results A supplemental drop wire or half-pin significantly increased bending and torsional stiffness. The supplemental half-pin increased caudocranial stiffness significantly more than placing a drop wire. Placing a 2nd or 3rd pin afforded significantly greater increases in construct stiffness in all modes of loading, with 3 half-pin constructs having significantly greater axial and caudocranial stiffness than 2 half-pin constructs. Placing a single supplemental pin induced cantilever bending resulting in angular displacement of the Delrin rod during axial loading and high strain in both the fixation wire secured distal to the ring and the pin. Supplemental half-pins incrementally reduced strain in all fixation elements and resulted in linear displacement of the Delrin rod during axial loading. Conclusion If using supplemental half-pins as fixation elements, insertion of 2 or 3 pins is preferred over a single pin.

AB  - Summary Thromboelastometry point-of-care coagulation testing facilitates optimised management of bleeding. Previous thromboelastometry systems required the blood sample and liquid reagents to be pipetted in several manual steps by trained personnel. The ROTEMsigma coagulation analyser is a fully automated point-of-care device. We aimed to assess the reference ranges of the new device and to compare the results with those of the predecessor device, the ROTEMdelta. We took blood from healthy volunteers and from hyper- or hypocoagulable patients; blood samples from healthy volunteers served to determine reference ranges for the most important parameters for the ROTEMsigma: CTEXTEM 48?61 s; A5EXTEM 30?51 mm; MCFEXTEM 54?70 mm; CTINTEM 138?174 s; MCFINTEM 51?67 mm and MCFFIBTEM 5?24 mm. We then used blood samples from patients to compare the results obtained between the old and the new device. We found a strong correlation between the same tests performed on two ROTEMsigma devices and between the ROTEMsigma and the ROTEMdelta with respect to the determination of thromboelastometry parameters of hyper- and hypocoagulable patients (all p < 0.001 and R > 0.8). Performance evaluation for the ROTEMsigma device showed very high precision (R > 0.99, p < 0.001). Our reference ranges can serve as an important aid for other hospitals using this new device.

AB  - Background and Purpose Postoperative pain is one of the most common manifestations of acute pain and is an important problem faced by patients after surgery. Moreover, neuronal trauma or chemotherapeutic treatment often causes neuropathic pain, which induces disabling and distressing symptoms. At present, treatments of both painful conditions are inadequate. α-Spinasterol, which is well characterized as a transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 antagonist, has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antinociceptive effects. Therefore, we investigated its antinociceptive potential on postoperative and neuropathic pain, as well as its effect on COX-1 and COX-2 activities. Experimental Approach Nociceptive responses in a postoperative pain model (surgical incision-induced) or different neuropathic pain models (trauma or chemotherapy-induced) were investigated in mice. Key Results Oral administration of α-spinasterol reduced postoperative pain, when given as a pre- (0.5 h before incision) or post-treatment (0.5 h after incision), and reduced cell infiltration in the injured tissue. α-Spinasterol also reduced the mechanical allodynia induced by partial sciatic nerve ligation and the mechanical and cold allodynia induced by paclitaxel. Moreover, α-spinasterol inhibited COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme activities without altering the body temperature of animals. Importantly, α-spinasterol did not alter spontaneous or forced locomotor activity. Furthermore, it did not cause gastric damage or liver and kidney changes, nor did it alter cell viability in the cerebral cortex and spinal cord slices of mice. Conclusion and Implications α-Spinasterol is an effective and safe COX inhibitor with antinociceptive effects in postoperative and neuropathic pain models. Therefore, it is an interesting prototype for the development of novel analgesic drugs.

AB  - Background On-scene management of pre-hospital emergencies is often inter-disciplinary, involving ground-emergency medical services (EMS), police- and fire services, and in Norway general practitioners on-call. This can also be supplemented by physician-staffed EMS (P-EMS), utilizing helicopters or rapid response vehicles. We hypothesized that P-EMS cooperates extensively with other emergency services, and therefore the primary aim of this study was to investigate the fraction of inter-disciplinary cooperation between P-EMS and other emergency services. Methods Retrospective, observational study of primary pre-hospital missions with patient contact performed at a Norwegian P-EMS base from 01.01.06 to 31.12.15. Descriptive statistics, comparisons using Student`s t-test, and chi-squared test for trend were applied. Results Inter-disciplinary cooperation occurred in 94.3% of the 8580 missions, of which physician-staffed EMS cooperated with ground EMS in 92.4%, general practitioner 32.9%, police service 11.6% and fire service 11.8%. Trauma constituted 34.4 and cardiac arrest 14.1% of missions. The mean National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics score was 4.21 (95% Confidence Interval 4.18?4.24). There was an overall decrease in cooperation with general practitioners and the police service (P < 0.001). During helicopter missions, we reported a decrease in general practitioner cooperation compared to an increase during rapid response car missions (P < 0.001). In cardiac arrest cases, cooperation with both general practitioners and the fire service increased (P < 0.001). Conclusion Physician-staffed EMS cooperates extensively with other professional emergency services, especially ground-EMS. On-scene cooperation with general practitioners decreased, whereas there was an increased cooperation with the fire service in a ?first-responder? role during cardiac arrest missions.

AB  - Abstract Toxic oxygen free radical damage is thought to play an important role in events such as trauma and sepsis, in which adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure (MOF) are the major causes of late death. Serum lipofuscin concentration has been proposed as an indicator of lipid peroxidation caused by toxic oxygen free radicals. Serum lipofuscin level was measured in 75 healthy controls and sequentially in 66 patients in the intensive care unit; the latter included 18 patients who had undergone elective major vascular surgery, 20 after repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and 28 with severe blunt trauma. Fifteen of the 66 patients died within 2 days. Ten of the remaining 51 patients developed ARDS and/or MOF and 41 had an uncomplicated postoperative course. Serum lipofuscin concentration in controls showed a positive correlation with age. Compared with controls, all three patient groups had significantly increased lipofuscin concentrations during the first day after major vascular surgery, trauma or shock. In addition, the ten patients who subsequently developed ARDS and/or MOF showed significantly increased lipofuscin levels on day 1, compared with those in the 41 who had an uncomplicated clinical course. The concentration of serum lipofuscin, which may act as a simple and valuable measure of grading oxidative stress, is positively related to the incidence of subsequent ARDS and/or MOF in patients at risk of these syndromes.

AB  - Objective. The purpose of this study was to compare the value of high-resolution ultrasonography (HRUS) and computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of nasal fractures. Methods. Facial CT and HRUS examinations performed on 140 consecutive patients (103 male and 37 female; age range, 2?74 years; mean, 26 years) with nasal trauma between October 2004 and April 2007 were retrospectively evaluated. Sonograms were obtained with a hockey stick probe (15?7 MHz linear array transducer). All patients also underwent facial CT and conventional radiography. The nasal fracture detection rates for HRUS, CT, and conventional radiography were compared with the clinical and surgical diagnosis. Nasal fractures were classified into high- and low-grade groups according to severity. They were also compared with the CT findings of all 280 lateral nasal bones and with HRUS findings as the reference standard. Results. The accuracy rates for HRUS, CT, and conventional radiography in detecting nasal fractures were 100%, 92.1%, and 78.6%, respectively. Compared with HRUS, CT revealed only 196 of 233 lateral nasal bone fractures; its accuracy was 80%. In high-grade fractures, the accuracy of CT was 87%, but it decreased to 68% in low-grade fractures. Conclusions. Compared with HRUS, CT had lower accuracy, especially in low-grade nasal fractures. Thus, HRUS is a reliable diagnostic tool for the evaluation of nasal fractures.

AB  - Abstract Despite the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural interventions in improving the experience of obsessions and compulsions, some people do not benefit from this approach. The present research uses a case series design to establish whether mindfulness-based therapy could benefit those experiencing obsessive?intrusive thoughts by targeting thought?action fusion and thought suppression. Three participants received a relaxation control intervention followed by a six-session mindfulness-based intervention which emphasized daily practice. Following therapy all participants demonstrated reductions in Yale-Brown Obsessive?Compulsive Scale scores to below clinical levels, with two participants maintaining this at follow-up. Qualitative analysis of post-therapy feedback suggested that mindfulness skills such as observation, awareness and acceptance were seen as helpful in managing thought?action fusion and suppression. Despite being limited by small participant numbers, these results suggest that mindfulness may be beneficial to some people experiencing intrusive unwanted thoughts and that further research could establish the possible efficacy of this approach in larger samples.?Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message: ? Preliminary evidence is provided for the use of mindfulness-based therapy with obsessive intrusive thoughts. ? Mindfulness processes may be useful in the management of thought-action fusion and thought suppression.

AB  - Abstract Few studies have investigated deployment-related experiences of healthcare workers dispatched for medical humanitarian aid or attempted to assess their difficult living and working environments. This is the first study to develop and validate a scale to measure these kinds of difficulties, in 264 Japanese healthcare workers. The Humanitarian Aid Difficulty Scale was developed in three stages. First, an item pool was generated based on literature and expert reviews. The scale was then tested in a pilot study. Reliability and validity were identified through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha. The scale consisted of 23 items across five factors based on exploratory factor analysis (cooperation, health status, infrastructure, culture and customs, and supplies and equipment). The total variance explained was 60.7%. Reliability of the five factors was acceptable and validity was supported by confirmatory factor analysis. Cronbach's alpha for the scale was 0.87. The scale may enable evaluation of the level of difficulty of the living and working environments of Japanese healthcare workers in medical humanitarian aid who are at a greater risk of distress.

AB  - Abstract Saturation transfer in cross-linked copolymer gels and excised intact and perforating trauma-induced cataract mouse lenses (4- or 8-week-old) were studied using intermolecular cross-relaxation rates (1/TIS(H2O); 1/TIS), monitored with f2-irradiation at ?8.79, ?4.00, and 7.13?ppm (?H2/2π???69?Hz). [1] The 1/TIS(7.13?ppm) vs dry weight [W (%)] profiles for hydrophilic copolymer gels were far steeper than those for hydrophobic copolymer gels, indicating the participation of an amount of bound water and a number of copolymer hydroxyl groups in the saturation transfer process. In contrast, the 1/TIS(?8.79?ppm) vs W (%) profiles exhibited little difference between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic copolymer gels, indicating the major participation of molecular rigidity, i.e. W (%) in the saturation transfer process. [2] The 1/TIS(7.13?ppm) values for cataractous mouse lenses were larger than those for intact lenses, indicating the formation of large, immobile lens protein associates or aggregates containing a sufficient amount of bound water for the saturation transfer. [3] The 1/TIS(7.13?ppm) vs W (%) profiles for the hydrophilic copolymer gels exhibited similar characteristics to the intact and cataractous mouse lenses with regard to the saturation transfer process.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this study was to compare the sperm morphology and nuclear sperm quality (sperm aneuploidy and DNA fragmentation) in two groups of globozoospermic patients: DPY19L2-mutated patients (n = 6) and SPATA16-mutated patients (n = 2). Results for these two groups were also compared to a group of fertile men (n = 25). Fluorescence in situ hybridisation was performed for chromosomes X, Y and 18. Sperm DNA fragmentation was evaluated by TUNEL assay. Sanger sequencing was performed for mutations screening of DPY19L2 and SPATA16 genes. Sperm analysis revealed a classic phenotype of total globozoospermia in DPY19L2-mutated group and a particular phenotype characterised by a predominance of double/multiple round-headed (39.00 ± 4.2%) and multi-tailed spermatozoa (26.00 ± 16.97%) in SPATA16-mutated group. FISH analysis showed a significantly higher aneuploidy rate in globozoospermic patients compared to controls (p < 0.05), and a higher rate was observed in SPATA16-mutated group compared to DPY19L2-mutated group (p < 0.05). DNA fragmentation index was significantly higher in globozoospermic men compared to controls (p < 0.001), and there is no statistically significant difference between the two globozoospermic groups. We showed that SPATA16 defects could be associated with an abnormal meiosis leading to a particular morphological sperm defect of double/multiple round-headed and multi-flagella and a higher sperm aneuploidy rate than in case of DPY19L2-defects in classic globozoospermia.

AB  - We conducted an exploratory, qualitative study investigating experiences of women who had developed breast cancer under the age of 40 and who were identified as BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers. These germline mutation carriers face an increased lifetime risk of a second primary breast cancer and an increased risk for a primary ovarian cancer. Thirteen women who fit this criteria participated in three focus groups conducted at a major cancer center in the UK during Spring 2003. We asked broad, open-ended questions that allowed for a wide range of responses about their cancer and genetic testing experiences, physical and psycho-social concerns, family and partner reactions and their need for social support. The women expressed feelings of devastation, loneliness, feeling different and isolation, ambivalence about having to support family members, worries about partner's anxiety and depression, and anxiety about talking to family members, especially children. These feelings were stronger after the cancer diagnosis and compounded by the genetic test results that occurred at a later time. We also found that, at least temporarily, the women experienced what we call ?social separation??emotional distance from, or dissonance with groups they interact with or are part of, e.g., family and friends, frequently leading to a reduction in communication or a change in previously unstated, but accepted normal interaction. We concentrate on a few characteristics of social separation?feelings of aloneness, isolation and separation, use of silence and verbal discretion, the relationship between estrangement and kinship interaction and norm disruption, and are looking at social patterns of interpersonal relationships that may occur when risk and illness statuses are new and framing and feeling rules have not as yet been clearly developed due to a cultural lag.

AB  - Abstract Aim Laparoscopy offers the benefits of minimally invasive surgery and faster recovery. Acute surgical patients may potentially benefit from the great advantages of emergency laparoscopy, which is more clinically relevant in acute than elective patients. Fashioning a laparoscopic intracorporeal anastomosis (ICA) after emergent colorectal resection, whenever technically feasible and not contraindicated by the patient's general and haemodynamic condition, is a most challenging technical skill. Method During the period 2010?2016, 59 patients underwent a laparoscopic procedure for colorectal emergency in an acute care setting by a single operating surgeon with advanced laparoscopic skills and specific expertise in both colorectal surgery and acute care surgery. This series includes 32 laparoscopic right colectomies (12 for obstruction and 20 for perforation/peritonitis) and 27 left colectomies (6 for obstruction and 21 for perforation/peritonitis). Twenty-eight ileocolic side-to-side ICA, and 27 left colonic ICA (3 colocolic, 24 colorectal) were performed. Results Reasonably good postoperative outcomes were observed in the entire series of 59 laparoscopic colectomies performed in an urgent setting. Overall, the major morbidity rate in the entire group was 16.9% (10/59) with an incidence of intra-abdominal abscess of 11.8% (7/59); the overall leak rate was 3.4% (2/59). The re-operation rate was 3.4% (2/59). A video included in the Supporting Information shows five different sites and techniques for ICA and describes technical details with tips and tricks. All patients shown in the video had an uneventful postoperative recovery and were managed postoperatively according to enhanced recovery after surgery protocols. Conclusion This case series illustrates all possible sites and techniques for colonic ICA in an emergency setting. All colorectal and acute care surgeons should have laparoscopic suturing skills.

AB  - Aims.  To report the findings of an investigation of patients with diabetes and burns, with emphasis on implications for practice: primary and secondary preventions. Background.  Diabetes and burns are complex conditions with multi-system involvements, which worsen outcomes for patients, and their management. This research investigated outcomes for patients and diabetes management. Methods.  Data on outcomes were obtained from records of patients hospitalised for foot burns in an Australian hospital from 1999?2004. A questionnaire survey design was employed to obtain information on how clinicians in burns units manage diabetes. SPSS was used to analyse data obtained from both resources. Comments written in the questionnaire were analysed using relational analysis. Results.  Of the 64 patients, 12 were with diabetes and 52 were without diabetes. Those with diabetes were more likely to sustain contact foot burns (58·3% Diabetes Mellitus vs. 13·5% non Diabetes Mellitus ?2?=?11·487, p?=?0·002). The duration of hospitalisation was statistically significantly longer among patients with diabetes compared with those without diabetes (U?=?169, p?=?0·014); although the two groups were not statistically significant different in terms of severity of burns and received treatment. Of the 29 clinical leaders, 21 (72%) indicated that they regularly provided care to patients with diabetes. Most respondents (n?=?15; 58%) reported that new plans need to be initiated to accommodate the combined insult of diabetes and burns. Diabetes centres were located in all participating sites; but not always involved in the process of care. Conclusion.  The co-existence of diabetes and burns worsens outcomes for patients, and complicates management plans. Optimal management can be achieved via a multidisciplinary approach starting with glycaemic control, and continued to aggressive management of diabetes and burns. Relevance to clinical practice.  Preventive measures should start with tight glycaemic control, identification and avoidance of sources of trauma, early detection and treatment, and continue to aggressive inpatient management of patients with both diabetes and a burn injury.

AB  - Abstract Semen analysis is a basic step in the investigation of several disturbances affecting the male genital tract. Analysis of seminal parameters provides important clinical information on the spermatogenesis and functional competence of spermatozoa, as well as on the secretory pattern of the accessory genital glands. Semen analysis is particularly useful in the evaluation of couples requiring fertility investigation (to detect genital infections and pathologies) and in verifying the influence of environmental factors, drugs, lifestyle, chemical products, and professional activities on several diseases affecting male reproductive health. Measure of semen quality is of substantial interest for diagnoses in clinical urology, andrology, and gynecology. Currently, basic requirements for semen analysis are standardized by World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines that describe several procedures for an objective evaluation of the semen quality with diagnostic purposes. These guidelines include: parameters for the physical and biochemical evaluation of semen; parameters for the analysis of sperm characteristics; and other seminal parameters that can be easily adopted in any laboratory. This report summarizes current concepts on semen analysis and the significance of the seminal parameters for reaching a diagnosis based on the procedures recommended by WHO guidelines. J. Clin. Lab.
