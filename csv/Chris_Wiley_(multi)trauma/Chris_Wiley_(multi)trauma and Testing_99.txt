AB  - Abstract Saturation transfer in cross-linked copolymer gels and excised intact and perforating trauma-induced cataract mouse lenses (4- or 8-week-old) were studied using intermolecular cross-relaxation rates (1/TIS(H2O); 1/TIS), monitored with f2-irradiation at ?8.79, ?4.00, and 7.13?ppm (?H2/2π???69?Hz). [1] The 1/TIS(7.13?ppm) vs dry weight [W (%)] profiles for hydrophilic copolymer gels were far steeper than those for hydrophobic copolymer gels, indicating the participation of an amount of bound water and a number of copolymer hydroxyl groups in the saturation transfer process. In contrast, the 1/TIS(?8.79?ppm) vs W (%) profiles exhibited little difference between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic copolymer gels, indicating the major participation of molecular rigidity, i.e. W (%) in the saturation transfer process. [2] The 1/TIS(7.13?ppm) values for cataractous mouse lenses were larger than those for intact lenses, indicating the formation of large, immobile lens protein associates or aggregates containing a sufficient amount of bound water for the saturation transfer. [3] The 1/TIS(7.13?ppm) vs W (%) profiles for the hydrophilic copolymer gels exhibited similar characteristics to the intact and cataractous mouse lenses with regard to the saturation transfer process.

AB  - Abstract This study aimed to determine whether functional disturbances in fronto-striatal control circuits characterize adolescents with Bulimia Nervosa (BN) spectrum eating disorders regardless of clinical severity. FMRI was used to assess conflict-related brain activations during performance of a Simon task in two samples of adolescents with BN symptoms compared with healthy adolescents. The BN samples differed in the severity of their clinical presentation, illness duration and age. Multi-voxel pattern analyses (MVPAs) based on machine learning were used to determine whether patterns of fronto-striatal activation characterized adolescents with BN spectrum disorders regardless of clinical severity, and whether accurate classification of less symptomatic adolescents (subthreshold BN; SBN) could be achieved based on patterns of activation in adolescents who met DSM5 criteria for BN. MVPA classification analyses revealed that both BN and SBN adolescents could be accurately discriminated from healthy adolescents based on fronto-striatal activation. Notably, the patterns detected in more severely ill BN compared with healthy adolescents accurately discriminated less symptomatic SBN from healthy adolescents. Deficient activation of fronto-striatal circuits can characterize BN early in its course, when clinical presentations are less severe, perhaps pointing to circuit-based disturbances as useful biomarker or risk factor for the disorder, and a tool for understanding its developmental trajectory, as well as the development of early interventions.

AB  - Aims.  To report the findings of an investigation of patients with diabetes and burns, with emphasis on implications for practice: primary and secondary preventions. Background.  Diabetes and burns are complex conditions with multi-system involvements, which worsen outcomes for patients, and their management. This research investigated outcomes for patients and diabetes management. Methods.  Data on outcomes were obtained from records of patients hospitalised for foot burns in an Australian hospital from 1999?2004. A questionnaire survey design was employed to obtain information on how clinicians in burns units manage diabetes. SPSS was used to analyse data obtained from both resources. Comments written in the questionnaire were analysed using relational analysis. Results.  Of the 64 patients, 12 were with diabetes and 52 were without diabetes. Those with diabetes were more likely to sustain contact foot burns (58·3% Diabetes Mellitus vs. 13·5% non Diabetes Mellitus ?2?=?11·487, p?=?0·002). The duration of hospitalisation was statistically significantly longer among patients with diabetes compared with those without diabetes (U?=?169, p?=?0·014); although the two groups were not statistically significant different in terms of severity of burns and received treatment. Of the 29 clinical leaders, 21 (72%) indicated that they regularly provided care to patients with diabetes. Most respondents (n?=?15; 58%) reported that new plans need to be initiated to accommodate the combined insult of diabetes and burns. Diabetes centres were located in all participating sites; but not always involved in the process of care. Conclusion.  The co-existence of diabetes and burns worsens outcomes for patients, and complicates management plans. Optimal management can be achieved via a multidisciplinary approach starting with glycaemic control, and continued to aggressive management of diabetes and burns. Relevance to clinical practice.  Preventive measures should start with tight glycaemic control, identification and avoidance of sources of trauma, early detection and treatment, and continue to aggressive inpatient management of patients with both diabetes and a burn injury.

AB  - Abstract Background The objective of this study was to investigate whether work unit-levels of psychosocial working conditions modify the effect of depressive symptoms on risk of long-term sickness absence (LTSA). Methods A total of 5,416 Danish female eldercare workers from 309 work units were surveyed using questionnaires assessing depressive symptoms and psychosocial working conditions. LTSA was derived from a national register. We aggregated scores of psychosocial working conditions to the work unit-level and conducted multi-level Poisson regression analyses. Results Depressive symptoms, but not psychosocial working conditions, predicted LTSA. Psychosocial working conditions did not statistically significantly modify the effect of depressive symptoms on LTSA. Conclusions Psychosocial working conditions did not modify the effect of depressive symptoms on LTSA. The results, however, need to be interpreted with caution, as we cannot rule out lack of exposure contrast and non-differential misclassification of the exposure. Am. J. Ind.

AB  - Introduction Clinical trials that involve participants from multiple sites necessitate standardized and reliable quantitative MRI outcomes to detect significant group differences over time. Metabolite concentrations measured by proton MRS (1H-MRS) provide valuable information about in vivo metabolism of the central nervous system, but can vary based on the acquisition and quantitation methods used by different MR sites. Therefore, we investigated the intra- and inter-site reproducibility of metabolite concentrations measured by 1H-MRS on MRI scanners from a single manufacturer across six sites. Methods Five healthy controls were scanned twice within 24 h at six participating 3 T MR sites with large single-voxel PRESS (TE/TR/NSA = 36 ms/4000 ms/56) and anatomical images for voxel positioning and correction of partial volume relaxation. Absolute metabolite concentrations were calculated relative to the T1 and T2 relaxation corrected signal from water. Intra- and inter-site reproducibility was assessed using Bland?Altman plots and intra- and inter-site coefficient of variation (CoV) as well as intra- and inter-site intra-class correlation coefficient. Results The median intra-site CoVs for the five major metabolite concentrations ([NAA], [tCr], [Glu], [tCho] and [Ins]) were between 2.5 and 5.3%. Inter-site CoVs were also low, with the median CoVs for all metabolites between 3.7 and 6.4%. Metabolite concentrations were robust to small inconsistencies in voxel placement and site was not the driving factor in the variance of the measurement of any metabolite concentration. Between-subject differences accounted for the majority of the concentration variability for creatine, choline and myo-inositol (42?65% of the variance). Conclusion A large single-voxel 1H-MRS acquisition from a single manufacturer's MRI scanner is highly reproducible and reliable for multi-site clinical trials.

AB  - ABSTRACT:? Context: The practice of emergency medicine presents many challenges in rural areas. Purpose: We describe how rural hospitals nationally are staffing their Emergency Departments (EDs) and explore the participation of rural ED physicians and other health care professionals in selected certification and training programs that teach skills needed to provide high-quality emergency care. Methods: A national telephone survey of a random sample of rural hospitals with 100 or fewer beds was conducted in June to August 2006. Respondents included ED nurse managers and Directors of Nursing. A total of 408 hospitals responded (96% response rate). Findings: A majority of rural hospitals use more than one type of staffing to cover the ED. The type of staffing varies by time period and ED volume. On weekdays, about onethird of hospitals use physicians on their own medical staff; one third use contracted coverage; 18% use both; and 14% use physician assistants and/or nurse practitioners with a physician on-call. Hospitals are more likely to use a combination of medical staff and contracted coverage on evenings and weekends. Advanced Cardiac Life Support training is common, but Pediatric Advanced Life Support, Advanced Trauma Life Support, and training in working as a team are less common. More registered nurses working in rural EDs have taken the Trauma Nursing Core Course than the Emergency Nursing Pediatric Course. Conclusions: Rural ED staff would benefit from additional continuing education opportunities, particularly in terms of specialized skills to care for pediatric emergency patients and trauma patients and training in working effectively in teams.

AB  - Abstract Objective To identify abnormalities of the celiac artery (CA) and major branches in dogs and cats by computed tomography angiography (CTA). Study design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Two hundred fifty-four dogs and 13 cats. Methods Abdominal CTA images from 2009 to 2017 were reviewed. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between CA abnormalities and sex, age, size of dog, concurrent venous anomaly, or presence of gastrointestinal signs. Results Abnormalities in the CA were observed in 32 animals (11.9%) including 9 with abnormal branching (3.4%) and 23 with CA compression (8.6%). A celiacomesenteric trunk was observed in 8 (2.9%; 6 dogs, 2 cats). The splenic artery originated from the cranial mesenteric artery in 1 dog; the hepatic arterial branches originated from the left gastric artery in another. Four out of 32 animals (12.5%) with an arterial anomaly had another vascular abnormality. Large breed dogs were more likely to have an arterial anomaly (OR 4.3, 95% CI: 1.18-15.5, P?=?.02) and 12 times more likely to have CA compression (OR 12.0, 95% CI: 1.4-97.7, P?=?.02) compared to small breed dogs. Dogs with CA compression were more likely to present for gastrointestinal signs (OR 3.6, 95% CI: 1.2-10.3, P?=?.01). Conclusion Anomalies of the celiac trunk are apparent on CTA and may impact surgical or image-guided intervention. Compression at the origin of the CA was apparent on imaging, similar to the median arcuate ligament syndrome in people, although the significance of this finding in dogs is unknown.

AB  - Summary Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has emerged as an effective, safe and non-invasive form of brain stimulation to treat neuropsychiatric disorders. Although the majority of clinical efficacy data has come from studies that have evaluated the efficacy of this treatment in depression, a number of other disorders have been investigated. A number of rTMS studies have investigated whether the treatment can attenuate anxiety symptoms in post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. Preliminary data suggest that it may be possible to attenuate symptoms in these disorders. The rTMS treatment effects on multiple symptom domains of schizophrenia have been studied. There is some conflicting evidence on the efficacy of rTMS in the treatment of refractory auditory hallucinations. Negative symptoms and cognition in schizophrenia are other symptom domains that have also been studied with mixed results. Some preliminary studies also suggest that rTMS may have a cognitive enhancing effect in major neurocognitive disorders. A number of studies suggest that rTMS may reduce craving for a number of addictive disorders. In general, the data from the broad literature on the use of rTMS in neuropsychiatric disorders other than depression suggest that there is promise for this modality of treatment; however, definitive, multi-centre randomized controlled data are needed to establish its use in clinical practice.

Study Design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Dogs (n?=?84) and cats (16). Methods Medical records (January 2000 to December 2009) of dogs and cats that had hemipelvectomy at participating institutions were reviewed. Postoperative progress and current status of the patient at the time of the study was determined by either medical record review, or via telephone contact with the referring veterinarian or owner. Results Complications were infrequent and usually minor. Hemorrhage was the main intraoperative complication; 2 dogs required blood transfusion. One dog developed an incisional hernia. In dogs, hemangiosarcoma had the worst prognosis with a median survival time (MST) of 179 days. MST for chondrosarcoma (1232 days), osteosarcoma (533 days), and soft tissue sarcoma (373 days) were not statistically different. Median disease-free interval (DFI) for local recurrence of all tumor types was 257 days. Cats had 75% survival at 1 year, which was significantly longer than dogs. Conclusions Survival times for most tumor types can be good, but surgical margins should be carefully evaluated to ensure complete tumor removal. Adjuvant therapies may be advisable particularly for dogs to reduce rates of local recurrence or distant metastasis.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aims Despite ambiguous evidence for the effectiveness of alcohol screening with brief interventions (BI) in emergency departments (ED), ambition for their widespread implementation continues to grow. To clarify whether such an application of BI is justifiable, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on studies testing the impact of BI on alcohol consumption. Methods We included peer-reviewed, randomized controlled studies investigating the effects of BI on alcohol consumption in injured and/or intoxicated patients, published January 2002?September 2015. Changes from baseline in consumption quantity, intensity and number of heavy drinking episodes were assessed at 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-up, resulting in nine separate random-effects meta-analyses of standardized mean differences (SMD). Moderation effects of intervention mode, length, type of interventionist, intensity of control intervention and study quality were assessed using subgroup comparisons and meta-regression. Results We considered 33 publications (28 separate studies) including 14 456 patients. Six of nine comparisons revealed small significant effects in favour of BI, with the highest SMD at 0.19 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.08?0.31]. No significant moderators could be identified, and statistical heterogeneity (I2) was below 40%. Conclusions In a large meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in emergency care settings, there was evidence for very small effects of brief interventions on alcohol consumption reductions. More intensive interventions showed no benefit over shorter approaches. Non-face-to-face interventions appear to be comparably effective, but this finding remains tentative due to the low number of non-face-to-face studies.

AB  - Objectives To estimate the incidence proportion of road traffic accidents in cats attending emergency out-of-hours clinics in the UK, identify major risk factors for road traffic accident occurrence and for survival to discharge. Materials and Methods A retrospective study of a cohort of 33,053 cats in the VetCompass database attending emergency-care practice between January 1, 2012 and February 15, 2014. Incidence proportion was calculated and logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for road traffic accident and survival to discharge following road traffic accident. Results Incidence proportion was estimated at 4∙2% (95% confidence interval: 4∙0 to 4∙4%). Cats aged 6 months to 2 years were at increased odds of road traffic accident, as were male cats and crossbred cats. Odds of road traffic accident were highest in the autumn. Spinal injury, abdominal injury and increasing count of injuries were associated with increased odds of death. Clinical Significance Road traffic accident is a frequent presentation in emergency-care practice. Identification of risk factors for death within the first 24?hours following a road traffic accident can aid veterinarian and owner decision-making for treatment of cats involved in a road traffic accident.

AB  - Human skeletal remains of sixteen individuals found at Dibba al-Hisn in the Emirate of Sharjah (UAE) are analysed with regard to standard anthropological criteria. They represent the poorly known pre-Islamic period of the first centuries AD. Remains of at least fifteen individuals were recovered from a semi-subterranean grave-chamber together with rich archaeological grave-goods. An additional, almost complete skeleton was found in the open area near the chamber. While the size and nature of the sample prevent demographic analyses, skeletal features studied with the help of macro- and microscopic as well as radiographic methods provide details on individual life histories and living conditions, as well as mortuary habits and taphonomic processes. Of special interest is a case of intentional tooth mutilation as well as two cases of skull trauma apparently caused by violent inter-personal conflict. The results of the analysis of the faunal remains from the grave-chamber and its surroundings are presented in an appendix.

AB  - Abstract In this study, the Inoperability Input-Output Model (IIM) is deployed for assessing the impacts of disruptive events on interconnected economic systems. The IIM is based on Wassily Leontief's input-output model which is capable of describing the ripple effects of disruptions to interdependent systems. Besides describing economic impact in financial terms, the ?inoperability? metric is also used in the IIM to quantify the percentage of a system's production that is affected relative to the desired level. To analyze the magnitude and extent of system linkages, an interdependency matrix based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is constructed. The study highlights four key features of the IIM. First, demand patterns in the aftermath of such events are modeled and analyzed using available sector-based performance data. Second, the NAICS-based capital flow data released for the first time in 2003 by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis enable applying a dynamic IIM to describe the temporal behavior of economic impacts associated with disruptive events. Third, a discussion on utilizing other sources of data, such as consumer confidence for forecasting system-specific demand disruptions, is presented. Fourth, a visualization tool is presented for conducting a multi-criteria ranking of the most-affected systems using both economic loss and inoperability metrics. Ultimately, the study offers insights on describing the sensitivity of economic systems to various classes of disruptions. In the broader perspective, this can provide guidance toward policymaking activities. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Syst Eng 9: 20?34, 2006

AB  - ABSTRACT Skin loss can be caused by accident, burn, trauma, chronic wounds, and diseases, which is severely aggravated by multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Soft hybrids based on biopolymers combined with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have potential applications as wound dressing supports and skin tissue repair. Thus, our study focused on the design, green synthesis, and comprehensive characterization of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC?AgNP) nanocomposites for producing hydrogel membranes, with tunable physicochemical properties, cytocompatibility, and biocidal activity for potential application as wound dressing and skin repair. These nanocomposites were prepared using CMC with two degrees of carboxymethylation, distinct concentrations of citric acid (CA) crosslinker, and AgNPs by in situ chemical reduction, forming hybrid membranes by the solvent casting method. The results demonstrated that superabsorbent hydrogels were produced with swelling and degradation behaviors dependent on the concentration of CA crosslinker, degree of carboxymethylation of CMC, and content of AgNP in the matrices. Moreover, the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis evidenced that the CMC functional groups (e.g., ?COOH and ?OH) were directly involved in the chemical reactions for the formation of AgNPs and hydrogel crosslinking pathway. These nanocomposites were cytocompatible using in vitro 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cell viability assay with of human embryonic kidney cells. Conclusively, the CMC?AgNP nanohybrids demonstrated to be simultaneously non-toxic combined with highly effective antibacterial activity against gram-positive multi-resistant wound/skin pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus) and moderate effect towards gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objective? To compare the biomechanical properties of cervical arthroplasty to a ventral slot procedure and pin-polymethylmethacrylate (pin-PMMA) fixation. Sample Population? Fresh cadaveric cervical (C2?T1) spines from 6 large dogs. Methods? Four spinal conditions were studied in each spinal specimen: intact, disk arthroplasty, ventral slot, and fixation with smooth pin-PMMA at C5?C6 intervertebral space. Axial compression, torsion, flexion?extension, and lateral bending moments were sequentially tested on each specimen for the 4 spinal conditions. Data from the C3?C4, C4?C5, C5?C6, and C6?C7 vertebral motion units (VMUs) were compared among treatments. Results? In axial compression and torsion, the ventral slot procedure allowed significantly less motion than intact, pin-PMMA, and arthroplasty groups at C5?C6. In lateral bending and flexion?extension, pin-PMMA had the least motion of C5?C6, followed by the arthroplasty group, intact spine, and ventral slot, all of which were significantly different from each other. Overall, the artificial disk was better able to mimic the behavior of the intact specimens compared with the ventral slot and pin-PMMA, producing similar displacements in axial compression and rotation in torsion, but more limited motion than intact in flexion?extension and in lateral bending. Conclusion? Cervical spine specimens with an implanted prosthesis have biomechanical behaviors more similar to an intact spine compared with spinal specimens with ventral slot and pin-PMMA procedures. Cervical arthroplasty may then preserve some of the motion in the affected area after neural decompression while providing distraction. Clinical Relevance? Cervical arthroplasty should be further investigated in vivo to determine if it is a viable alternative to the ventral slot or pin-PMMA procedures for surgical treatment of cervical diseases in dogs and in particular for treatment of disk-associated caudal cervical spondylomyelopathy.

AB  - Abstract This paper describes the impact of critical incidents and psychological debriefings on 172 emergency service, welfare and hospital personnel in Australia. Experience of trauma at work was found to reactivate prior trauma in one in two personnel. Psychological debriefing was reported to reduce stress symptoms in almost all personnel who reported stress response. The effectiveness of the debriefing was found to derive, in large part, from talking and in particular from talking with others who had experienced the same situation.
