AB  - Abstract Patients with supraventricular tachycardia commonly present to the ED. There is a lack of consensus regarding assessment of these patients. Our aim was to determine the utility of troponin and four other investigations (full blood examination, electrolyte levels, thyroid function tests and chest X-rays) commonly requested for these patients. MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 1992?March 2017) were searched for randomised controlled trials and observational studies (of sample size greater than 10). Our search strategy yielded no randomised controlled trials and seven observational studies with significant statistical heterogeneity among selected studies (I2 87.3%, P < 0.001). Included studies investigated a total of 1155 patients. All studies reported on the utility of troponin testing in this patient population. The pooled proportion of patients investigated with troponin was 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.44?0.88). The pooled proportion of positive troponin tests was 0.32 (95% confidence interval 0.23?0.41). Only one study reported on the utility of the remaining four investigations with abnormal results as follows: thyroid stimulating hormone 14%, haemoglobin 6%, white cell count 19% and chest X-ray 22%. Investigations are commonly requested for patients presenting with supraventricular tachycardia. Troponin testing is commonly performed with a high proportion of positive findings although these results did not appear to be associated with major adverse cardiac events. Heterogeneity among studies and low levels of evidence precluded conclusions on full blood examinations, electrolyte levels, thyroid testing and utility of chest X-rays in this patient population.

AB  - Objectives To determine if serum cardiac troponin I concentrations ? measured with both a first-generation assay and a high-sensitivity assay ? were greater in dogs with generalised seizures than in controls and to identify clinical variables associated with cardiac troponin I concentration. Materials and Methods Prospective study of 30 dogs with recent generalised seizures and 30 healthy controls. Serum cardiac troponin I concentration was measured using two commercially available assays, and the correlation of clinical factors with concentration was examined. Results Serum concentrations of cardiac troponin I were higher in dogs that had recent seizures compared to controls when measured by both assays. The predictors most clearly associated with cardiac troponin I concentration were number of seizures and age. Both predictors were positively associated with increasing concentrations of troponin I. Clinical Significance Serum cardiac troponin I concentration was significantly elevated in dogs that had recent generalised seizures when compared to controls, and concentrations were higher in dogs that experienced more seizures. This association may indicate that generalised seizures are associated with damage to the myocardium.

AB  - Background More sensitive troponin assays have the potential to better evaluate patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Meanwhile, they may result in avoidable diagnostic testing. Hypothesis Our aim was to determine the clinical impact of implementing a more sensitive cardiac troponin I (cTnI) assay in patients with acute non-traumatic chest pain presenting to the emergency department (ED). Methods This is a pre-post cohort study. A total of 1201 consecutive patients with acute non-traumatic chest pain or equivalent ischemic symptoms suggestive of ACS were allocated to two groups according to the cTnI assay used. The outcomes included the ED length of stay (LOS), hospital admission rate, the use of procedures and the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 30?days. Results The introduction of the more sensitive troponin assay shortened ED LOS (odds ratio [OR] 0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-0.54) regarding patients discharged home directly, increased the hospital admission rate (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.12-1.84), the use of echocardiography (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.22-2.06), coronary computed tomography angiography (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.04-3.06), coronary angiography (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.10-2.12) and percutaneous coronary intervention (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.58-3.70) regarding patients discharged or admitted. The incidence of MACE did not decrease significantly (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.27-1.37). Conclusions The introduction of the more sensitive troponin assay appeared to result in less time spent in the ED regarding patients discharged home directly, but prompted more hospitalizations and procedures without impacting the incidence of MACE.

AB  - Objective? To determine if dogs and cats with renal failure, or other severe non-cardiac disease, and no antemortem evidence of cardiac disease on basic clinical evaluation, have elevated levels of cardiac troponin I (cTnI). Design? Cross-sectional study using 56 dogs and 14 cats with primary non-cardiac disease (39 dogs with azotaemic renal failure, 14 cats with azotaemic renal failure, 17 dogs with non-cardiac systemic disease); 7/25 dogs and 6/14 cats had murmurs detected on physical examination. Serum or heparinised plasma was collected and analysed for cTnI. Results? Cardiac troponin I concentrations were elevated above reference intervals in 70% of dogs and 70% of cats with azotaemic renal failure and in 70% of dogs with a variety of systemic non-cardiac diseases. Cardiac troponin I concentrations did not correlate with the degree of azotaemia, presence of murmurs, hypertension or type of non-cardiac illness. Conclusions? Cardiac troponin I concentration is often elevated in dogs and cats with azotaemic renal failure and in dogs with other systemic non-cardiac illness, suggesting that these conditions often result in clinically inapparent myocardial injury or possibly altered elimination of cTnI.

AB  - Abstract Background Although cardiac troponin has been well established as diagnostic and prognostic makers for acute coronary heart disease, the prognostic value of elevated cardiac troponin in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) was inconsistent and not systematically evaluated. Hypothesis We proposed the hypothesis that the practical utility of cardiac troponin levels for prediction of mortality and poor outcome in ICH patients. Methods A total of 1004 patients with ICH were retrospectively reviewed and qualified for further analysis from June 2012 to December 2015. The patients were divided into different groups based on measurements of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) at the time of admission and the following day. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis were performed to determine the independent prognostic value of the cTnI for patients in-hospital mortality and poor outcomes, the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to assess the predictive value of cTnI, ICH score, and combination of them. Results Serum cTnI level was an independent predictor in-hospital mortality (positive vs negative, HR (hazard ratios) = 3.44, 95% CI (confidence interval) 1.66-7.13, P <?.001) and poor outcomes in patients with ICH (positive vs negative, HR = 6.69, 95% CI 4.25-10.52, P <?.001). Addition of cTnI to ICH score significantly improved the prognostic discrimination for both in-hospital mortality and poor outcomes. Conclusion Serum cTnI levels may be valuable as predictor for in hospital mortality and poor outcomes and may be useful in the risk stratification of ICH during hospitalization.

AB  - Abstract: Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) is a cardio-specific myofibrillar protein known to be elevated early after heart transplantation and during cardiac allograft rejection. cTnT determination in heart allograft recipients showed elevated levels in patients with higher degrees of graft rejection (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grades?≥3A?4). Subgroup analyses revealed demographic patient characteristics markedly improving the diagnostic efficiency of cTnT measurement for rejection monitoring, including male recipient gender, recipient age <60 yr, female donor gender and donor age?≥?33 yr. The clinical utility of these parameters was confirmed by longitudinal patient data and may help to select recipients most likely to benefit from cTnT rejection surveillance.

AB  - Summary Reason for performing study: Information is lacking regarding the influence of long distance exercise on the systemic concentration of cardiac troponin I (cTnl) in horses. Objectives: To determine if the concentration of cTnl in horses competing in 80 and 160 km endurance races increases with exercise duration and if cTnl concentrations can be correlated with performance data. Methods: Blood samples for the measurement of cTnl and 3 min electrocardiogram recordings were obtained from horses prior to, during and after completion of 80 and 160 km endurance races at 3 ride sites during the 2004 and 2005 American Endurance Ride Conference competition seasons. Results: Full data sets were obtained from 100 of the 118 horses. Endurance exercise was associated with a significant increase in cTnl over baseline in both distance groups. Failure to finish competition (poor performance) was also associated with an increased cTnl concentration over baseline at the time of elimination when data from both distances were combined. Other than one horse that developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, no arrhythmias were noted on the 3 minute ECG recordings that were obtained after endurance exercise in either distance group. Conclusions: Systemic concentrations of cTnl increase in endurance horses competing in both 80 and 160 km distances. Although final cTnl concentrations were significantly increased over their baseline values in horses that failed to finish competition, the degree of increase was not greater than the increase over baseline seen in the horses that successfully completed competition. The clinical significance of increased cTnl in exercising horses could not be ascertained from the results of this study. Potential relevance: These data indicate that cardiac stress may occur in horses associated with endurance exercise. Future studies utilising echocardiograpy to assess cardiac function in horses with increased cTnl are warranted.

AB  - Introduction: Mitral valve disease (MVD) is the most common acquired heart disease in dogs. When it results in congestive heart failure (CHF), MVD becomes an important cause of morbidity and mortality in dogs. Markers for determining the severity of cardiac injury and the heart's response to therapy might provide valuable information regarding the overall prognosis early in the course of CHF. This information might also provide a means for identifying those dogs with MVD that are at risk for CHF and those that might benefit from specific therapeutic interventions. In this study, we propose to investigate markers of cardiac myocyte injury in dogs that present in advanced (or Class IV) CHF due to MVD. Cardiac troponin I (CTnI) and cardiac troponin T (CTnT) are markers specific for cardiac myocyte damage, and serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP and pro-BNP), for myocyte stretch. These markers have shown predictive value in human and veterinary medicine, however further investigation is required. It is our hypothesis that one or more of these markers will be elevated at presentation compared to established laboratory normal values. Methods: Fifteen dogs that presented with Class IV CHF due to MVD based on physical examination findings, thoracic radiographs, and cardiac ultrasound had a blood sample drawn to measure serum levels of CTnT, CTnI and BNP, and pro-BNP at a commercial laboratory using immunoassays. Results: Our results show that 1 of 15 dogs had an elevated CTnT, 6 had an elevated CTnI, 0 had an elevated pro-BNP, and 3 had and elevated BNP level above laboratory normal values. Conclusions: There was no consistent elevation of CTnI, CTnT, BNP or pro-BNP in dogs with class IV CHF due to MR at time of presentation. Further studies need to be performed to evaluate these makers in dogs with CHF due to MR at varying intervals after admission to determine their potential benefits as markers of cardiac injury and response to therapy.

AB  - SUMMARY:? Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in patients with renal failure. Patients with renal failure are at greater risk of atypical presentations of myocardial ischaemia. Traditional markers of myocardial damage are often increased in renal failure in the absence of clinically suspect myocardial ischaemia. The cardiac troponins are specific markers of myocardial injury. Large-scale trials, excluding patients with renal disease, have shown the importance of the cardiac troponins in predicting adverse outcome and in guiding both therapy and intervention in acute coronary syndromes. Cardiac Troponin T and cardiac Troponin I are increased in patients with renal failure and this is likely to represent multifactorial pathology including cardiac dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac microinfarctions. Increases in serum troponin from baseline, in patients with renal disease with acute coronary syndromes, may represent a poor prognosis. Small studies of patients with renal failure have suggested that elevation of the cardiac troponins is associated with an increased risk of cardiac death.

AB  - Introduction Cardiac troponin-I (cTn-I) has been previously validated in horses. Newer high sensitivity troponin assays have recently become available that are now the standard in human cardiology. The objective was to validate the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin-T (hscTn-T) assay for use in horses and to determine the biological variation within and between horse breeds. Methods Samples were analysed using the hscTn-T assay reagent (Roche,Cobas c501). Method validation included linearity, lower limit of quantitation (LLQ), freeze-thaw stability, within-and between-run precision, and comparison with cTn-I (Abbott iSTAT, Deming regression). Normal range and biological variation included healthy horses (n?=?120; age?=?7.2?±?0.5 years (SE)) representing 5 breeds. Results Assay was linear from 3?391?ng/L. The LLQ was validated at 3?ng/L. Stability of samples was unaffected by 3 freeze-thaw cycles. Within-run mean (±SD) was L1?=?6.50 (±0.97), L2?=?10.1 (±0.88), L3?= 15.3 (±0.82)?ng/L and between-run mean (±SD) was L1?=?12.2 (±1.03), L2?=?57.0 (±4.82), L3?=?256 (±23.1)?ng/L. Comparison with cTn-I assay showed excellent correlation (range: 8?3535?ng/L, r?=?0.9998). Bias was evident in the regression results [hscTnT?=?(0.6153?±?0.002809)*(cTnI*1000)???(11.53?±?5.462)]. The 95th and 99th percentile of the normal distribution in healthy horses was 4 and 6?ng/L. Between breed, diurnal effect and between day variation was not detectable due to low concentrations of hscTnT. Conclusions This study established reference intervals for hscTn-T assay in healthy horses and the performance characteristics of hsTn-T assay in horse samples. Normal population distribution was mostly below the detection limit of the assay. The hscTn-T assay will likely establish the standard in early detection of cardiac pathologies in horses. Ethical Animal Research This study was approved by the Veterinary Sciences Animal Care Committee (protocol number AC12-0049). Sources of funding:?UCVM internship fund. Competing interests:?none.

AB  - Objective Accurate and rapid diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (MI) is of major medical and economic importance. The objective of this study was to identify whole saliva high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) in patients with acute MI. Subjects and Methods A case?control study was carried out in 30 normal healthy individuals, and 30 patients with acute MI were hospitalized in CCU of Imam Hossein hospital, Tehran, Iran. The hs-cTnT levels were assayed in serum and whole saliva in the first and second morning following the MI by ELISA method. Statistical analysis of the Student's t-test and Pearson correlation coefficient was performed. Results The mean stimulated and unstimulated saliva and serum levels of hs-cTnT at both the first and the second morning following the acute MI were significantly higher in patients with acute MI compared with healthy individuals. Furthermore, stimulated and unstimulated saliva hs-TnT levels correlated significantly with serum hs-TnT level (r = 0.415, P < 0.023; r = 0.466, P < 0.021, respectively). Conclusion Results suggest that salivary hs-cTnT can be used as an alternative to serum hs-cTnT for diagnosis and monitoring of myocardial infarction.

AB  - Cardiac troponins are sensitive and specific markers of myocardial injury. The troponin concentration can be thought of as a quantitative measure of the degree of injury sustained by the heart, however, it provides no information on the cause of injury or the mechanism of troponin release. Conventionally, the cardiac troponins have been used for diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in humans and have become the gold standard biomarkers for this indication. They have become increasingly recognized as an objective measure of cardiomyocyte status in both cardiac and noncardiac disease, supplying additional information to that provided by echocardiography and ECG. Injury to cardiomyocytes can occur through a variety of mechanisms with subsequent release of troponins. Independent of the underlying disease or the mechanism of troponin release, the presence of myocardial injury is associated with an increased risk of death. As increasingly sensitive assays are introduced, the frequent occurrence of myocardial injury is becoming apparent, and our understanding of its causes and importance is constantly evolving. Presently troponins are valuable for detecting a subgroup of patients with higher risk of death. Future research is needed to clarify whether troponins can serve as monitoring tools guiding treatment, whether administering more aggressive treatment to patients with evidence of myocardial injury is beneficial, and whether normalizing of troponin concentrations in patients presenting with evidence of myocardial injury is associated with reduced risk of death.

AB  - Abstract Background Multiple cardiac and non-cardiac processes may cause an elevated highly sensitive troponin (hsTn). We postulated that the consumption of a seriously hot vindaloo could cause an increase in hsTn levels in seemingly healthy volunteers. Objective To determine whether eating a very hot curry can cause elevated hsTn. Methods This was a prospective observational cohort study. Participants had blood drawn for hsTn pre-ingestion and at 2 and 4 h post-ingestion of, first, a rather mild butter chicken and, 2 weeks later, a seriously hot lamb vindaloo. We assessed pre-curry tolerance and perception of curry hotness for both curries using the VHOT scale. Results Although no participant had a troponin above the reference range at any point in time, we found dramatic relative increases in troponin in many of our participants. In the vindaloo phase, 8/22 (36%) had a relative change >20%, whereas 5/22 (23%) had a relative change >50% at 4?h. However, these changes were not significantly different to those in the butter chicken phase. Based on biological variability alone, 15/22 (68%) had a relative change of >20%, and 11/22 (50%) had a relative change of >50% between the two sessions (pre-ingestion). Conclusions Eating a seriously hot vindaloo does not appear to be a risk factor for troponitis, and people may consume vindaloo safely with the knowledge that this is unlikely to result in significant damage to their myocardium. However, clinicians should be aware of the biological variability of hsTn and exercise caution when interpreting apparent changes within the normal range.

AB  - ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious condition, the diagnosis of which currently depends on functional markers such as serum creatinine measurements. Unfortunately, creatinine is a delayed and unreliable indicator of AKI. The lack of early biomarkers of structural kidney injury (akin to troponin in acute myocardial injury) has hampered our ability to translate promising experimental therapies to human AKI. Fortunately, understanding the early stress response of the kidney to acute injuries has revealed a number of potential biomarkers. The discovery, translation and validation of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), possibly the most promising novel AKI biomarker, is reviewed. NGAL is emerging as an excellent stand-alone troponin-like structural biomarker in the plasma and urine for the early diagnosis of AKI, and for the prediction of clinical outcomes such as dialysis requirement and mortality in several common clinical scenarios. The approach of using NGAL as a trigger to initiate and monitor therapies for AKI, and as a safety biomarker when using potentially nephrotoxic agents, is also promising. In addition, it is hoped that the use of sensitive and specific biomarkers such as NGAL as endpoints in clinical trials will result in a reduction in required sample sizes, and hence the cost incurred. Furthermore, predictive biomarkers like NGAL may play a critical role in expediting the drug development process. However, given the complexity of AKI, additional biomarkers (perhaps a panel of plasma and urinary biomarkers) may eventually need to be developed and validated for optimal progress to occur.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There are currently no studies detailing cardiac troponin I (cTnI) release and clearance in normal horses post exercise using an analytically validated assay. These data are essential for selecting appropriate sampling times in equine athletes with suspected myocardial damage. Objective To plot the magnitude and time course of cTnI release and clearance, using a validated cTnI assay, after maximal effort. Study design Descriptive longitudinal study. Methods Five clinically normal Standardbred racehorses in full race training were included in the study. Physical examinations were performed on subjects and blood samples were taken via jugular venipuncture pre-exercise. Horses were exercised in harness at race intensity in groups on a training track. A second blood sample was taken immediately post exercise and an intravenous catheter was then placed in a jugular vein. Hourly blood samples were taken for 24?h. All samples were collected in red top serum Vacutainer? tubes and allowed to clot for 30?min before being centrifuged and serum harvested. Serum samples were stored at ?80°C until analysis. All samples were analysed using the Abbott ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitivity cTnI? assay. Results Mean resting cTnI level was 1.33?±?0.6?ng/l (range, 0.82?2.33?ng/l). All horses exhibited an increase in cTnI level after exercise with peak elevation occurring 2?6?h post exercise (mean, 4.6?±?1.7?h). Mean peak increase in cTnI level was 11.96?±?9.41?ng/l (range, 1.72?23.76?ng/l). All horses returned to baseline levels within 24?h. Conclusions All horses experienced an increase in cTnI post exercise, with the peak occurring 2?6?h post exercise. Further studies are needed to determine the significance of these increases.

AB  - Background Increased cTnI concentrations are associated with adverse outcomes in humans and animals. Limited information is available on the prognostic value of cTnI in cows. Objective To measure cTnI in cows with noncardiac diseases and evaluate the association of cTnI concentration with adverse outcomes such as death or early removal from the herd. Animals Thirty control and 53 diseased cows. Methods Serum cTnI concentrations were determined with a point-of-care immunoassay. Cows were diagnosed ante- or postmortem with metritis (n = 6), mastitis (n = 4), peritonitis (n = 6), LDA (n = 14), LDA and metritis (n = 4), pneumonia (n = 6), dystocia requiring cesarean section (n = 5), and downer cow syndrome (n = 8). Animal survival was determined for up to 2 months after presentation. Results The immunoassay showed reliability for the detection of bovine cTnI. Cows with LDA and metritis (P < .05), peritonitis (P < .05), LDA (P < .001), dystocia requiring cesarean section (P < .01), and downer cow syndrome (P < .001) had higher cTnI concentrations than control cows. The odds of a negative outcome (death or culling) for cows with cTnI concentrations of ≥0.05, ≥0.1, ≥0.2, and ≥0.5 ng/mL were 2.4, 2.9, 4.8, and 6.2, respectively. Conclusion Cows with noncardiac diseases may have some degree of myocardial injury. The magnitude of cTnI increased may assist clinicians in evaluating the risk of an adverse outcome and help guide decision-making regarding treatment and prognosis.
