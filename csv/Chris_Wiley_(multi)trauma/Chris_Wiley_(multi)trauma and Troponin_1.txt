AB  - Abstract Objective ED chest pain assessments can be challenging, lengthy and contribute to overcrowding. Rapid accurate risk stratification strategies should improve ED length of stay (EDLOS). Emergency, Biochemistry and Cardiology implemented new guidelines using paired (<3?h) multiple cardiac markers to stratify patients. The intervention would reduce chest pain EDLOS. We observed for safety and disposition effects. Methods This is a single-site, prospective observational, before and after intervention study. In December 2009, paired multiple cardiac markers, the second at least 4?h from pain, replaced late troponins. The 4 h rule (ED flow improvement) started in April 2009 (unplanned confounder). Demographics, clinical features, risk assessment and disposition; preferably prospective. Administrative datasets provided disposition outcomes, 4 months pre-/post-intervention. Follow up with partially blinded adjudications assessed for 45?day major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Before intervention, consecutive patients were enrolled with mixed prospective/retrospective data. After, sampling occurred whenever prospective data were collected. Results Adjudicated patients were n?=?1029 (14.2% MI, 14.9% MACE), 426 before, 603 after. EDLOS reduced 87?min (416?329; P?<?0.001), similar to triage 2 patients without chest pain. Possibly, avoidable MACE occurred in five of 598 discharges (0.8%, CI 0.3?1.8%) with non-significant decreases (0.5%, CI 0.1?1.8%) post-intervention. Disposition changes included greater observation ward use (3.8?12.3%; P?<?0.001), more discharges (47.4?52.9%, P?=?0.002), less transfers (9.3?6.9%, P?=?0.014) and less late inpatient discharge decisions (15.2?8.7%, P?=?0.001). Conclusion Paired cardiac markers performed adequately for avoidable MACE, and disposition improved significantly. A confounding system change meant the reduced EDLOS (primary outcome) was unable to be associated with the intervention.

AB  - Introduction In chuckwagon racing, dubbed the ?half-mile of hell?, teams often race multiple consecutive days. Horses are in peak condition, however rare cases of sudden death attributed to cardiovascular failure occur. There are concerns regarding cumulative racing and its impact on the risk of sudden death. The objective was to determine if cumulative exercise affects integrity of the myocardium, assessed by high-sensitivity troponin-T (cTnT), and if the presence of arrhythmias during race or recovery affects plasma cTnT concentrations. Methods Heart rate and electrical activity were recorded on 148 horses (9?±?2.7 years) during racing days 1 and 2. 750 plasma samples were analysed (374 pre-exercise, 376 post-exercise) comparing cTnT before and after activity (paired t-test). Associations between consecutive racing days, age and cTnT were analysed (ANOVA, Pearson Correlation). The relationship between arrhythmias and cTnT was also examined. Results cTnT increased significantly with exercise (pre: 4.52?ng/L?±?0.17, post: 5.20?ng/L?±?0.23, P<0.001). However cTnt was not affected by cumulative exercise. A correlation between age and cTnT was found. 4235 arrhythmic events were recorded. No association existed between cTnT (post-exercise) and the presence of arrhythmias during exercise and recovery. Conclusions This is the first study examining the effect of exercise on high-sensitivity cTnT in horses and first large-scale study on chuckwagon horses. Racing increases cTnT, however values remain low, suggesting myocardial damage of little clinical significance. Chuckwagon horses have long careers therefore age and cTnT could be further examined. cTnT was not affected by the presence of arrhythmias during exercise, indicating chuckwagon racing is well tolerated. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the Veterinary Sciences Animal Care Committee of the University of Calgary (AC120049) and onwer informed consent was obtained. Sources of funding:?Clinical Research Fund from the University of Calgary's Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. Summer Studentships were funded by NSERC. Competing interests:?none.

AB  - Abstract Objective Many meta-analyses have provided synthesised likelihood ratio data to aid clinical decision-making. However, much less has been published on how to safely combine clinical information in practice. We aimed to explore the benefits and risks of pooling clinical information during the ED assessment of suspected acute coronary syndrome. Methods Clinical information on 1776 patients was collected within a randomised trial conducted across five South Australian EDs between July 2011 and March 2013. Bayes theorem was used to calculate patient-specific post-test probabilities using age- and gender-specific pre-test probabilities and likelihood ratios corresponding to the presence or absence of 18 clinical factors. Model performance was assessed as the presence of adverse cardiac outcomes among patients theoretically discharged at a post-test probability less than 1%. Results Bayes theorem-based models containing high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-troponin) outperformed models excluding hs-troponin, as well as models utilising TIMI and GRACE scores. In models containing hs-troponin, a plateau in improving discharge safety was observed after the inclusion of four clinical factors. Models with fewer clinical factors better approximated the true event rate, tended to be safer and resulted in a smaller standard deviation in post-test probability estimates. Conclusions We showed that there is a definable point where additional information becomes uninformative and may actually lead to less certainty. This evidence supports the concept that clinical decision-making in the assessment of suspected acute coronary syndrome should be focused on obtaining the least amount of information that provides the highest benefit for informing the decisions of admission or discharge.

AB  - Introduction: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in dogs with urinary catheters in intensive care units (ICUs) are frequent. Historically, multi-drug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli account for about 10% of the UTIs. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of E. coli infections and of MDR E. coli in dogs with UTIs in our ICU, and to assess whether the MDR E. coli were community-acquired or nosocomial in origin. Methods: Over a 1-year period, rectal swabs were taken from all dogs in the ICU on the day of admission (D0) and on days 3 (D3), 6 (D6), 9 (D9) and 12 (D12). Urine was collected on these days from dogs with an indwelling urinary catheter (n=190). Rectal swabs and urine were routinely cultured. E. coli isolates were identified by biochemical tests. Using NCCLS guidelines, antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by disk diffusion method on fecal and urinary E. coli isolates. Twelve antimicrobial agents were used: nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin, and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to compare MDR E. coli UTI strains with fecal E. coli strains from the same patient and with MDR fecal E. coli from patients that were adjacent to, or housed in the same cages. Results: E. coli was cultured from 12 (48%) of 25 UTIs. Two of the E. coli were MDR. For one dog, PFGE showed no similarities among fecal E. coli and the urinary MDR E. coli isolates from the patient or between these isolates and fecal E. coli from a dog housed in the same kennel on the previous day. The MDR E. coli UTI was likely acquired prior to admission to the ICU, as it was present on D0. For the other dog, PFGE showed genetic similarity but not complete identity between the D3 MDR E. coli urinary isolate and the D3, D6, D9 fecal MDR isolates. This suggests that the UTI originated with the fecal E. coli. Using selective plates, fecal MDR E. coli were not found on D0. Selection of the MDR strain in the intestine by the use of antibiotics occurred while the dog was in the ICU and possibly led to the UTI. Conclusions: Multi-drug resistant E. coli accounted for 2 of 12 E. coli UTIs in dogs in the ICU over a 1-year period. Genotyping showed that one of the two MDR E. coli infections could possibly be of nosocomial origin.

AB  - Abstract Background Purulent pericarditis is an acute and fulminant disease characterized by pus accumulation in the pericardial space. Its incidence has declined substantially and the common pathogen has changed since the beginning of the antibiotic era; however, it is still found in some patients with immunocompromised conditions. Case report We report a rare case in which the onset of diabetes mellitus presented as extremely high HbA1c concentration, ketoacidosis, multi-site abscesses and purulent pericarditis. After antibiotic therapy and pericardiocentesis, the purulent pericarditis still did not resolve and further intrapericardial thrombolytic therapy also failed. Finally, this patient was treated successfully by surgical debridement and pericardiectomy. Conclusion In the immunocompromised state of severe hyperglycaemia, purulent pericarditis is a possible complication of uncontrolled infection. If purulent pericarditis cannot be cured using non-surgical treatments, such as antibiotic therapy, pericardiocentesis and intrapericardial thrombolytic therapy, a surgical pericardiectomy should be considered to avoid morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To compare cardiac risk stratification using a 0 and 2?h point-of-care (POC) cardiac troponin (cTn), 0 and 2?h POC multi-biomarkers against the 0 and 6?h laboratory cTn reference standard. Methods A prospective observational study of ED patients presenting with chest pain was performed. Patients were risk stratified and treated as per the Heart Foundation of Australia/Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (HF-A/CS-ANZ) guidelines using the 0 and 6?h laboratory cTn (T6). Patients were further stratified using a 0 and 2?h POC cTn (T2) plus 0 and 2?h POC multi-biomarkers (cTn, creatine kinase-MB, myoglobin) (M2). The T6, T2 and M2 strategies were compared using the 30-day major adverse cardiac events as the primary outcome. Results Seven hundred and four patients (median age 54 years, male 62.1%) were enrolled. Using the T6 reference standard, 2%, 61% and 37% were stratified as low, intermediate and high risk, respectively. The 30-day event rates were 0%, 3.5% and 28.6%, respectively. The T2 strategy stratified 1.5%, 57% and 41% as low, intermediate and high risk, respectively, with 30-day event rates of 0%, 4.2% and 24.8%, respectively. The M2 strategy resulted in significantly different risk distribution with 1%, 40% and 59% stratified as low, intermediate and high risk, respectively, with 30-day event rates of 0%, 3.9% and 18.8%, respectively. Conclusion Using a 2?h POC cTn-only biomarker strategy with the HF-A/CS-ANZ guidelines accurately identified a population at intermediate risk of 30-day events in whom further objective testing might be accelerated, allowing subsequent early discharge of the majority of this cohort. Within 2?h of presentation a high risk population could be identified in whom early management, including admission, was required.

AB  - Summary The physiological derangements that are frequently witnessed in the heartbeating brainstem-dead multiorgan donor are a result of both the adverse somatic consequences of treatment strategies for acute catastrophic brain injury as well as the well-described and specific consequences of brainstem ischaemia. The latter include diabetes insipidus, hypothermia, cardiovascular instability, neurogenic pulmonary oedema and systemic inflammation, and together they jeopardise the donation potential of the brainstem-dead donor. Donor management protocols are designed to help clinical staff detect and reverse these various derangements and require a continuation, and on occasion escalation, of physiological monitoring and support on the intensive-care unit. By increasing the number and quality of organs that are available for transplantation, physiological optimisation more completely fulfils the altruistic gift being made by the donor and their family, and should therefore be seen as an important component of the donor's end of life care.

AB  - Objectives To document the prevalence of cardiac abnormalities in dogs with steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis and to assess resolution of these abnormalities following corticosteroid therapy. Materials and Methods Steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis was diagnosed based on signalment, physical examination findings, complete blood count, biochemistry and CSF analysis. Echocardiography, C-reactive protein and cardiac troponin I were measured in all cases before and 10 to 14 days after commencing corticosteroid therapy. Fibrinogen was also measured in a proportion of dogs. Results Fourteen dogs were prospectively enrolled. Increased cardiac troponin I was identified in five of 14 dogs and echocardiographic abnormalities were detected in 12 of 14 dogs, including spontaneous echo contrast (12 of 14), mild pericardial effusion (five of 14) and mildly decreased fractional shortening (five of 14). All dogs had increased C-reactive protein and fibrinogen was increased in 11 of 12. Corticosteroid treatment was associated with clinical improvement and normalisation of C-reactive protein in all dogs. The cardiac troponin I levels normalised in four of five and fibrinogen had normalised in all five dogs which were retested. Spontaneous echo contrast improved or completely resolved in 12 of 12 and pericardial effusion resolved in five of five dogs. Fractional shortening normalised in two of five dogs. Clinical Significance Cardiac changes are common in dogs with steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis and most resolve with therapy. Further investigation into the cause and significance of these changes is necessary in determining whether antithrombotic therapy or positive inotropic therapy is indicated.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the clinical research priorities of Fellows of the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) in order to inform the strategic research agenda specific to multicentre clinical research. Methods An anonymous survey of all ACEM Fellows (FACEMs) listed on the ACEM researcher database was conducted between January and March 2013. Results Of 108 FACEMs invited to participate, 54 (50%) responded. Over half of respondents (61%) had a higher research degree but only a minority (24%) had funded research positions. The top research categories identified as priorities were resuscitation, trauma, cardiology, ED ultrasound, acute behavioural disturbance and geriatrics. The most common specific sub-categories included anterior chest pain, fluid resuscitation in trauma, and drug therapy for both atrial fibrillation and acute behavioural disturbance. Several specific research questions related to chest pain, resuscitation/sepsis, stroke, paediatrics and pulmonary embolus. Conclusion The findings provide guidance and support for research areas amenable to collaborative multicentre clinical research within emergency medicine. Discussion rounds are planned to translate these perceived research priorities to actual priorities.

AB  - Objectives To determine the underlying disease prevalence in acute feline dyspnoea and to examine whether historical and clinical examination findings can differentiate between acute cardiac and non-cardiac dyspnoea in cats in primary practice. Materials and Methods We prospectively enrolled cats presenting with dyspnoea for the first time to primary practice between June 1, 2011 and October 31, 2016. We collected signalment, historical and clinical data at presentation using a standard form. Cases were investigated by primary clinicians, and the final diagnosis was confirmed by the authors. Records lacking critical data were excluded. Relationships between historical or clinical variables and dyspnoea aetiology were examined. Diagnostic test performance analyses were used to find optimal cut-off values for select historical or clinical variables that could differentiate cardiac and non-cardiac dyspnoea. Results Participants included 108 cats. A definitive diagnosis was reached in 92 cases; 60 were cardiac (65%), 15 respiratory (16%), 10 neoplastic (11%) and 7 traumatic (8%). Of cats with cardiac dyspnoea, 25% had a history of cough. A gallop sound, rectal temperature less than 37·5°C, heart rate of greater than 200?bpm and respiratory rate greater than 80 per minute were all useful to predict cardiac-associated dyspnoea. A triage algorithm using these findings in combination was designed to optimise the rapid diagnosis of probable cardiac dyspnoea. Clinical Significance Dyspnoeic cats presenting in practice with hypothermia, tachycardia, gallop sounds or profound tachypnoea are likely to have a cardiac cause underlying their dyspnoea. Although diagnosis requires confirmation, clinicians may be able to stratify risk and prioritise further investigation based on these findings.

AB  - Abstract Objective Risk scores and accelerated diagnostic protocols can identify chest pain patients with low risk of major adverse cardiac event who could be discharged early from the ED, saving time and costs. We aimed to derive and validate a chest pain score and accelerated diagnostic protocol (ADP) that could safely increase the proportion of patients suitable for early discharge. Methods Logistic regression identified statistical predictors for major adverse cardiac events in a derivation cohort. Statistical coefficients were converted to whole numbers to create a score. Clinician feedback was used to improve the clinical plausibility and the usability of the final score (Emergency Department Assessment of Chest pain Score [EDACS]). EDACS was combined with electrocardiogram results and troponin results at 0 and 2?h to develop an ADP (EDACS-ADP). The score and EDACS-ADP were validated and tested for reproducibility in separate cohorts of patients. Results In the derivation (n = 1974) and validation (n = 608) cohorts, the EDACS-ADP classified 42.2% (sensitivity 99.0%, specificity 49.9%) and 51.3% (sensitivity 100.0%, specificity 59.0%) as low risk of major adverse cardiac events, respectively. The intra-class correlation coefficient for categorisation of patients as low risk was 0.87. Conclusion The EDACS-ADP identified approximately half of the patients presenting to the ED with possible cardiac chest pain as having low risk of short-term major adverse cardiac events, with high sensitivity. This is a significant improvement on similar, previously reported protocols. The EDACS-ADP is reproducible and has the potential to make considerable cost reductions to health systems.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the feasibility of CT pulmonary angiography for identification of naturally occurring pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs using predefined diagnostic criteria and to assess the ability of echocardiography, cardiac troponins, D-dimers and kaolin-activated thromboelastography to predict the presence of pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs. Methods Twelve dogs with immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia and evidence of respiratory distress were prospectively evaluated. Dogs were sedated immediately before CT pulmonary angiography using intravenous butorphanol. Spiral CT pulmonary angiography was performed with a 16 detector-row CT scanner using a pressure injector to infuse contrast media through peripheral intravenous catheters. Pulmonary thromboembolism was diagnosed using predefined criteria. Contemporaneous tests included echocardiography, arterial blood gas analysis, kaolin-activated thromboelastography, D-dimers and cardiac troponins. Results Based on predefined criteria, four dogs were classified as pulmonary thromboembolism positive, three dogs were suspected to have pulmonary thromboembolism and the remaining five dogs had negative scans. The four dogs identified with pulmonary thromboembolism all had discrete filling defects in main or lobar pulmonary arteries. None of the contemporaneous tests was discriminant for pulmonary thromboembolism diagnosis, although the small sample size was limiting. Clinical Significance CT pulmonary angiography can be successfully performed in dogs under sedation, even in at-risk patients with respiratory distress and can both confirm and rule out pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs.

AB  - Abstract Appropriate deliberate clinical inertia refers to the art of doing nothing as a positive clinical response. It includes shared decision-making to improve patient care with the use of clinical judgement. We discuss common clinical scenarios where the use of deliberate clinical inertia can occur. The insertion of peripheral intravenous cannulae, investigating patients with suspected renal colic and the investigation of low risk chest pain are all opportunities for the thoughtful clinician to ?stand there? and use effective patient communication to avoid low value tests and procedures. Awareness is key to identifying these opportunities to practice deliberate clinical inertia, as many of the situations may be so much a part of our environment that they are hidden in plain view.

AB  - A 16-year-old male was transported to our emergency department after he was kicked in the abdomen by a horse. He was diagnosed with injury of the liver and abdominal rectus muscle, and was cured by observational treatment. An Ichushi search was undertaken to identify articles published from 1983 to 2013 using the key words ?horse? and ?trauma?. We found 13 cases that described horse-related injuries and summarized these cases, including our case. There were 10 males, three females and one patient of an undescribed sex. The patients ranged in age from 16 to 58 years old, with an average age of 33 years. The injured sites were predominantly the face (mandible) and upper abdomen, indicating that a projecting part of the body may be more likely to be injured. Cardiac rupture, aortic head injury, or lethality induced by a horse kick have not been reported in Japan, but such injuries have been reported in other countries. Ten of 15 cases (67%) required surgical treatment for severe injuries. Horse kick injuries tend to be severe, because the transfer of energy from the end of the hoof, with a small cross-sectional area, to a small field, leads to internal organic injuries that are more severe than predicted, similar to a handlebar injury. Accordingly, we advocate the close observation of patients with horse kick injuries, which may be regarded as being similar to blunt stab wounds or hidden speared injuries.

AB  - Abstract Much is known about the positive effects of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) in regulating muscle protein metabolism. Comparatively much less is known about the effects of these amino acids and their metabolites in regulating myotube formation. Using cultured myoblasts, we showed that although leucine is required for myotube formation, this requirement is easily met by α-ketoisocaproic acid, the ketoacid of leucine. We then demonstrated increases in the expression of the first two enzymes in the catabolism of the three BCAA, branched-chain amino transferase (BCAT2) and branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD), with ~3? increase in BCKD protein expression (p < .05) during differentiation. Furthermore, depletion of BCAT2 abolished myoblast differentiation, as indicated by reduction in the levels of myosin heavy chain-1, troponin and myogenin. Supplementation of incubation medium with branched-chain α-ketoacids or related metabolites derivable from BCAT2 functions did not rescue the defects. However, co-depletion of BCKD kinase partially rescued the defects. Collectively, our data indicate a requirement for BCAA catabolism during myotube formation and that this requirement for BCAT2 likely goes beyond the need for this enzyme to generate the α-ketoacids of the BCAA.
