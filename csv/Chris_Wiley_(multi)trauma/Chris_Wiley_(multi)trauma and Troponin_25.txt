AB  - Abstract Background Pulmonary embolism (PE) associated with hemodynamic instability has exceedingly high mortality. We describe our experience using percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) in patients with massive PE (MPE) and submassive PE (SPE). Methods Thirty-six patients (16 males and 20 females; mean age, 51.4?±?6.6 years) with massive and submassive PE were treated with PMT. All patients exhibited acute symptoms and computed tomography evidence of large thrombus burden and evidence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and/or failure. An Aspirex? percutaneous aspiration device was used in all patients. Clinical outcomes, hemodynamic recovery, RV and pulmonary artery pressures (PAP), blood gas changes, thrombus clearance, and complications were evaluated. Results Treatment of 36 patients resulted in complete thrombus clearance (≥90%) in 83.3% of the patients (n?=?30) and near-complete (50% to 90%) clearance in 13.8%. Measurements before and after treatment showed a decrease in mean PAP (53?±?5.8?mmHg versus 25.6?±?6.3?mmHg in MPE group [p?<?0.01] and 46?±?7.7 versus 22?±?3.6 in SPE group [p?<?0.01]). One patient died from refractory shock. No cardiovascular deaths or recurrent PE were documented during clinical follow-up but one patient demonstrated evidence of mild cor pulmonale. Conclusions This study demonstrates safety and effectiveness of percutaneous mechanical aspiration thrombectomy in patients with massive and submassive PE with a large thrombus burden. doi: 10.1111/jocs.12521 (J Card Surg 2015;30:324?332)

AB  - The gradual accumulation of collagen and associated proteins of the extracellular matrix is a crucial myopathological parameter of many neuromuscular disorders. Progressive tissue damage and fibrosis play a key pathobiochemical role in the dysregulation of contractile functions and often correlates with poor motor outcome in muscular dystrophies. Following a brief introduction into the role of the extracellular matrix in skeletal muscles, we review here the proteomic profiling of myofibrosis and its intrinsic role in X-linked muscular dystrophy. Although Duchenne muscular dystrophy is primarily a disease of the membrane cytoskeleton, one of its most striking histopathological features is a hyperactive connective tissue and tissue scarring. We outline the identification of novel factors involved in the modulation of the extracellular matrix in muscular dystrophy, such as matricellular proteins. The establishment of novel proteomic markers will be helpful in improving the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy monitoring in relation to fibrotic substitution of contractile tissue. In the future, the prevention of fibrosis will be crucial for providing optimum conditions to apply novel pharmacological treatments, as well as establish cell-based approaches or gene therapeutic interventions. The elimination of secondary abnormalities in the matrisome promises to reduce tissue scarring and the loss of skeletal muscle elasticity.

AB  - Summary Pulmonary embolism (PE) presents in a continuum of severity that spans from incidentally discovered subsegmental PE to central or saddle PE that causes cardiogenic shock and sudden death. To date there has been limited dissemination of catheter-based interventions for PE partly due to the lack of prospective randomized controlled clinical trials that demonstrate their efficacy and safety. Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) is rarely used in current practice since it does not appear to offer any meaningful advantages to systemic thrombolysis. Although experience with right ventricular assist devices (RVADs) for the treatment of massive PE is extremely limited, there are case reports that suggest they can be a life-saving intervention in selected cases. Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are indicated in patients with acute PE who have contraindications to anticoagulation, and in patients with acute PE who have poor cardiopulmonary reserve and who are deemed to be at high risk of death if they develop another PE.

AB  - Reimbursement policies for health care services are greatly diminishing in the U.S. and Western Europe. Hence, there is an increasing need for doctors and other care givers to reduce costs without compromising the quality of the care being delivered. The clinical laboratory is viewed as an area of high costs where significant reductions have been targeted. Efficient utilization of laboratory services can be achieved by elimination of the general health panel, removal of old tests or those that provide redundant information, a reduction in the use of standing orders, more judicious use of drug assays, acceptance of clinical practice guidelines, and use of reflex testing algorithms. New technologies such as DNA probes can substantially improve diagnostic efficiency. Point-of-care testing devices which have higher costs than incremental central laboratory expenses should only be used if they reduce overall operating expenses. Implementation of expert systems can make remaining tests more effective. Doctors and laboratorians must collaborate to achieve more efficient utilization practices.

AB  - Abstract Cachexia presents with ongoing muscle wasting, altering quality of life in cancer patients. Cachexia is a limiting prognostic factor for patient survival and health care costs. Although animal models and human trials have shown mechanisms of motorprotein proteolysis, not much is known about intrinsic changes of muscle functionality in cancer patients suffering from muscle cachexia, and deeper insights into cachexia pathology in humans are needed. To address this question, rectus abdominis muscle samples were collected from several surgical control, non-cachectic and cachectic cancer patients and processed for skinned fibre biomechanics, molecular in vitro motility assays, myosin isoform protein compositions and quantitative ubiquitin polymer protein analysis. In pre-cachectic and cachectic cancer patient samples, maximum force was significantly compromised compared with controls, but showed an unexpected increase in myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity consistent with a shift from slow to fast myosin isoform expression seen in SDS-PAGE analysis and in vitro motility assays. Force deficit was specific for ?cancer?, but not linked to presence of cachexia. Interestingly, quantitative ubiquitin immunoassays revealed no major changes in static ubiquitin polymer protein profiles, whether cachexia was present or not and were shown to mirror profiles in control patients. Our study on muscle function in cachectic patients shows that abdominal wall skeletal muscle in cancer cachexia shows signs of weakness that can be partially attributed to intrinsic changes to contractile motorprotein function. On protein levels, static ubiquitin polymeric distributions were unaltered, pointing towards evenly up-regulated ubiquitin protein turnover with respect to ubiquitin conjugation, proteasome degradation and de-ubiquitination.

AB  - The translation of cardioprotection from robust experimental evidence to beneficial clinical outcome for patients suffering acute myocardial infarction or undergoing cardiovascular surgery has been largely disappointing. The present review attempts to critically analyse the evidence for confounders of cardioprotection in patients with acute myocardial infarction and in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. One reason that has been proposed to be responsible for such lack of translation is the confounding of cardioprotection by co-morbidities and co-medications. Whereas there is solid experimental evidence for such confounding of cardioprotection by single co-morbidities and co-medications, the clinical evidence from retrospective analyses of the limited number of clinical data is less robust. The best evidence for interference of co-medications is that for platelet inhibitors to recruit cardioprotection per se and thus limit the potential for further protection from myocardial infarction and for propofol anaesthesia to negate the protection from remote ischaemic conditioning in cardiovascular surgery.

AB  - Inotropes and vasopressors are biologically and clinically important compounds that originate from different pharmacological groups and act at some of the most fundamental receptor and signal transduction systems in the body. More than 20 such agents are in common clinical use, yet few reviews of their pharmacology exist outside of physiology and pharmacology textbooks. Despite widespread use in critically ill patients, understanding of the clinical effects of these drugs in pathological states is poor. The purpose of this article is to describe the pharmacology and clinical applications of inotropic and vasopressor agents in critically ill patients.

AB  - Abstract The brain is unquestionably the most fascinating organ, and the hippocampus is crucial in memory storage and retrieval and plays an important role in stress response. In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the seizure origin typically involves the hippocampal formation. Despite tremendous progress, current knowledge falls short of being able to explain its function. An emerging approach toward an improved understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms that underlie functions of the brain and hippocampus is neuroproteomics. Mass spectrometry has been widely used to analyze biological samples, and has evolved into an indispensable tool for proteomics research. In this review, we present a general overview of the application of mass spectrometry in proteomics, summarize neuroproteomics and systems biology-based discovery of protein biomarkers for epilepsy, discuss the methodology needed to explore the epileptic hippocampus proteome, and also focus on applications of ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) in disease research. This neuroproteomics survey presents a framework for large-scale protein research in epilepsy that can be applied for immediate epileptic biomarker discovery and the far-reaching systems biology understanding of the protein regulatory networks. Ultimately, knowledge attained through neuroproteomics could lead to clinical diagnostics and therapeutics to lessen the burden of epilepsy on society. ? 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 29:197?246, 2010

AB  - Summary Excellent outcomes are currently being achieved for children undergoing heart transplantation. The commonest indication for transplantation in children is dilated cardiomyopathy, but congenital heart disease (CHD) accounts for almost 40% of cases. Surgical ingenuity has led to successful transplantation for all forms of congenital defects, including abnormalities of situs. Infants undergoing transplantation for CHD have the highest perioperative mortality. None-the-less, infants who survive the early post-transplant period have the best long-term survival, likely reflecting a degree of immunological privilege. Adolescents have the worse post-transplant outcomes, in part related to poor adherence to medication regimens. Tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil are the most commonly used agents and approximately 70% of pediatric recipients receive induction therapy, most commonly with rabbit antithymocyte globulin. This is often used to help facilitate steroid avoidance or early steroid withdrawal, strategies providing particular advantage to pediatric recipients. The spectrum of post-transplant complications is similar to adults, though post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) occur more frequently, largely related to the high frequency of naïve status to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) at the time of transplantation in young recipients. As for adults, very long-term survival is limited by the development of coronary allograft vasculopathy. Retransplantation is used with relative frequency in the pediatric population, with reasonable long-term results when performed beyond the first six months after primary transplantation. Although enormous progress has been made over the last two decades, pediatric heart transplantation continues to be a palliative, rather than a curative therapy.
