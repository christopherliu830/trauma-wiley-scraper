AB  - Abstract Perioperative medicine is rapidly emerging as a key discipline to address the specific needs of high-risk surgical groups, such as those on chronic dialysis. Crude hospital separation rates for chronic dialysis patients are considerably higher than patients with normal renal function, with up to 15% of admission being related to surgical intervention. Dialysis dependency carries substantial mortality and morbidity risk compared to patients with normal renal function. This group of patients has a high comorbid burden and complex medical need, making accurate perioperative planning essential. Existing perioperative risk assessment tools are unvalidated in chronic dialysis patients. Furthermore, they fail to incorporate important dialysis treatment-related characteristics that could potentially influence perioperative outcomes. There is a dearth of information on perioperative outcomes of Australasian dialysis patients. Current perioperative outcome estimates stem predominantly from North American literature; however, the generalisability of these findings is limited, as the survival of North American dialysis patients is significantly inferior to their Australasian counterparts and potentially confounds reported perioperative outcomes; let alone regional variation in surgical indication and technique. We propose that data linkage between high-quality national registries will provide more complete data with more detailed patient and procedural information to allow for more informative analyses to develop and validate dialysis-specific risk assessment tools.

AB  - SUMMARY Hemoglobin (Hb) within red blood cells (RBC) is protected from oxidative processes by enzymatic and small molecule antioxidants as well as the RBC membrane that provides a physical barrier against oxidation. When Hb is introduced into the circulation as a result of hemolysis or following infusion of Hb-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs; ?blood substitutes?), the control of oxidative processes becomes dependent on plasma oxidative status. In vitro studies clearly demonstrate that Hb and HBOCs undergo oxidative modification at the site of heme iron and at multiple amino acid sites as a result of autoxidation, nitrosylation and peroxidation. Recent findings from in vitro studies provide a strong basis for understanding of potential toxicity in vivo. The antioxidative status of both plasma and tissue becomes an important factor in the control of Hb and HBOC oxidation and nitrosylation in the circulation. Several studies that performed ex vivo and in vivo have demonstrated a critical role for plasma antioxidants such as ascorbic acid and uric acid in maintaining Hb and HBOCs in functional non-oxidized states. In the present review we discuss mechanisms of Hb and HBOC autoxidation, nitrosylation and peroxidation in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, we explore the role(s) of plasma antioxidants in maintaining functional HBOC status that may potentially be exploited as part of protective strategies against Hb and HBOC oxidative toxicity.

AB  - Abstract Introduction and Objectives Prior studies demonstrated that plasma osmolality may have a predictive value for in-hospital mortality in patients with heart failure and acute coronary syndrome. In addition, plasma glucose and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, the components of plasma osmolality, have been shown to be an important contributor for in-hospital mortality in acute pulmonary embolism (APE) patients. Hence, the objective of the current study is to evaluate the effect of plasma osmolality upon admission with in-hospital mortality in patients with APE. Methods A total of 245 consecutive intermediate or high risk APE patients were enrolled into the study. The study population was divided into three tertile groups (T1, T2 and T3) based on the increased plasma osmolality. The in-hospital mortality was the primary end-point. Results After adjusting for all risk factors, in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in the T3 group compared to T1 and T2 groups (OR: 3.6, 95% CI: 1.3 to 18.8, P < .001). In addition, the incidence of asystolia, hypotension and cardiogenic shock were significantly higher in the T3 group. An area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of plasma osmolality for the in-hospital mortality was 0.76 with sensitivity 67.2% and specificity 74.1% 95% CI: (0.66-0.87, P < .001). Conclusion This is the first study to demonstrate that elevated levels of plasma osmolality may have a predictive value for in-hospital mortality in APE patients. Our findings are novel and deserve further studies whether the treatment of higher plasma osmolality may reduce the risk of in-hospital mortality in APE patients.

AB  - Summary: Assembly of C5b-9 on cell membranes results in transmembrane channels and causes cell death. When the number of C5b-9 molecules is limited, nucleated cells are able to escape cell death by endocytosis and by shedding of membranes bearing C5b-9. Sublytic C5b-9 induces proto-oncogenes, activates the cell cycle, and enhances cell survival. In addition, C5b-9 reverses the differentiated phenotype of post-mitotic cells, such as oligodendrocytes and skeletal muscle cells. The signal transduction pathways responsible for cell cycle activation by C5b-9 include Gi-mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K). Cell survival enhanced by C5b-9 is mediated by the PI3-K/Akt pathway, which inhibits apoptosis through regulation of BAD. These findings indicate that complement activation and membrane assembly of sublytic C5b-9 play an important role in inflammation by promoting cell proliferation and by rescuing apoptotic cells. This work was supported by NIH grants NS36231 and NS15662 and by multiple sclerosis pilot award PP-696.
