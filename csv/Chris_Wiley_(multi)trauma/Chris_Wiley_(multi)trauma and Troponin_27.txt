AB  - Abstract Purpose to evaluate the current rate of pulmonary embolism (PE) in our medico-surgical intensive care unit (ICU), to identify risk factors, and to determine the outcome of PE in ICU. Methods We performed a prospective cohort study of consecutive patients requiring intensive care admission during a one-year period. We included, in this prospective study, all the patients with confirmed PE admitted in ICU with more than 18 years of age, and expected to stay in ICU for more than 48 hours. Only the patients who had a clinical suspicion (unexplained hypoxemia and/or shock) for PE underwent diagnostic studies. Results During the study period, 842 patients were admitted in our ICU. One hundred and two patients were excluded. The diagnosis of PE was confirmed in 75 patients (10.1%). In our study, all patients (100%) had received some forms of pharmaceutical prophylaxis (PP) during ICU stay. The median time from ICU admission to diagnosis of PE was 6 days. The diagnosis of PE was made by spiral CT in 74 patients (98.7%), and by echocardiography in 1 case (1.3%). The mean ICU stay was 26.3 ± 26.5 days (median: 20 days). During their ICU stay, 73 patients (97.3%) developed one, or more, organ failure. Respiratory failure was the most observed (97.3%). Moreover, 38 patients (50.6%) developed nosocomial infections and 29 (38.6%) died. The multivariate analysis showed that the risk factors associated with mortality were the presence of shock the day of PE diagnosis and the presence of right ventricular dilatation on echocardiography. Conclusion Our findings confirm that subjects in the ICU are at high risk of PE, due to a high number of risk-factors. PE was associated with higher ICU mortality and a significantly higher ICU LOS. Our results invite to revise the preventive strategies of deep venous thrombosis and PE in patients requiring ICU admission.

AB  - Summary Body fluids (blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid) are preferred samples for neurological testing. This chapter focuses on the clinical laboratory examinations used to screen, diagnose, predict, and monitor neurologic disorders in geriatric patients. As the goals of laboratory testing in this population overlap those of general laboratory testing, a brief section on test interpretation and general laboratory considerations precedes the sections devoted to neurologic disorders of geriatric patients. The neurologic disorders for which laboratory investigations are described in the chapter are: dementias (Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body disease), movement disorders (Parkinson's disease and Parkinson-plus syndromes), cerebrovascular disorders (infarction and hemorrhage), and other disorders such as headache and depression.

AB  - Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and circulating endothelial cells (CECs) are mobilized from the bone marrow and increase in the early phase after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic significance of CECs and indices of endothelial dysfunction in patients with STEMI. In 78 patients with acute STEMI, characterization of CD34+/VEGFR2+CECs, and indices of endothelial damage/dysfunction such as brachial artery flow mediated dilatation (FMD) were determined. Blood samples for CECs assessment and quantification were obtained within 24 hours of admission and FMD was assessed during the index hospitalization. At 30 days follow up, the primary composite end point of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) consisting of all-cause mortality, recurrent nonfatal MI, or heart failure and the secondary endpoint of early adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling were analyzed. The 17 patients (22%) who developed MACE had significantly higher CEC level (P?=?0.004), von Willebrand factor (vWF) level (P?=?0.028), and significantly lower FMD (P?=?0.006) compared to the remaining patients. Logistic regression analysis showed that CECs level and LV ejection fraction were independent predictors of MACE. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) for CEC level, FMD, and the logistic model with both markers were 0.73, 0.75, and 0.82, respectively, for prediction of the MACE. The 16 patients who developed the secondary endpoint had significantly higher CEC level compared to remaining patients (P?=?0.038). In conclusion, increased circulating endothelial cells and endothelial dysfunction predicted the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events and adverse cardiac remodeling in patients with STEMI.

AB  - Abstract Electrochemical immunosensors (EIs) for the determination of disease biomarkers has attracted a wide interest due to its high sensitivity, low cost, and possible integration in compact analytical devices. The use of screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) to develop EIs contributes to the great potential they have in point of care (POC) test, since SPEs show good electrical properties and allow the reduction of the electrochemical instrumentation down to small pocket-size devices. Moreover, during the last years, SPEs have gone through significant improvements related to both their design and printing materials. Since cancer and cardiovascular diseases are the major threats of global health, there is a growing demand for the development of portable, rapid, simple and inexpensive devices for the detection of these diseases. This article presents an overview about the main biomarkers of cancer and cardiovascular diseases and the EIs based on SPEs for the detection of these biomarkers.
