AB  - Summary Phaeochromocytoma crisis is an endocrine emergency associated with significant mortality. There is little published guidance on the management of phaeochromocytoma crisis. This clinical practice update summarizes the relevant published literature, including a detailed review of cases published in the past 5 years, and a proposed classification system. We review the recommended management of phaeochromocytoma crisis including the use of alpha-blockade, which is strongly associated with survival of a crisis. Mechanical circulatory supportive therapy (including intra-aortic balloon pump or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation) is strongly recommended for patients with sustained hypotension. Surgical intervention should be deferred until medical stabilization is achieved.

AB  - Abstract Objective Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is commonly used in adult patients with coronary artery disease, but data on PCI in children and adolescents remain limited. Herein, we describe our experience with the use of PCI in pediatric and adolescent patients. Design This is a retrospective review. Setting The study was conducted at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. Patients All patients ≤18 years old who underwent PCI from 2004 to 2012 were included. Interventions Intravascular ultrasound and balloon angioplasty were performed in all patients, with subsequent stent placement in 6/7 (86%) procedures. Outcome Measures Residual postintervention stenosis, early procedural morbidity and mortality were the outcome measures. Results Overall, seven unique PCI procedures were performed in five patients (four males, mean age 13.2 ± 3.8 years, range 8?18 years). Mean follow-up interval was 2 (0.6?5.5) years. Indications for the procedures included transplant coronary vasculopathy (n = 1), coronary dissection (n = 1), and acute coronary thrombosis/myocardial infarction (n = 1). Additionally, there were two patients (n = 2) who experienced coronary compression as a sequelae of prior heart surgery. Intravascular ultrasound and balloon angioplasty were performed in all patients, with subsequent stent placement in 6/7 (86%) procedures. A total of eight stents were placed (average stent diameter 3 ± 0.5?mm), including six (75%) drug-eluting stents. The targeted coronary artery lesions were successfully treated in all seven procedures. There was no early procedural morbidity or mortality. Two patients were noted to have angiographic evidence of in-stent restenosis at 3 and 15 months postdeployment, respectively, despite treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel. Conclusion PCI in children and adolescents can be utilized to improve coronary blood flow in a variety of clinical situations. It may be particularly effective in cases of postsurgical coronary compression. Close angiographic follow-up is critical as these patients are at risk for in-stent restenosis.

AB  - Objectives The aim of this study was to assess the impact of bleeding after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents on long-term clinical events according to the newly proposed Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) classification. Background Current evidence about the impact of the BARC classification is limited. Methods Out of a total of 6,166 patients who underwent PCI in a prospective IRIS-DES registry, the impact of in-hospital bleeding defined as the BARC classification on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) comprising death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke was analyzed. Results In-hospital bleeding occurred in 235 patients (3.8%) according to BARC classification. During the 2-year follow-up, MACE occurred in 599 patients (9.7%). The 2-year incidence of MACE was significantly higher in patients with bleeding (16.7% vs. 8.3%; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2?2.3; P?=?0.002) than in those without bleeding. We observed a higher risk of MI (12.4% vs. 6.4%; adjusted HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2?2.6, P?=?0.005), stroke (3.0% vs. 0.6%; adjusted HR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.4?6.2, P?=?0.005) in patients with bleeding. Death (3.8% vs. 1.6%; adjusted HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.9?3.0, P?=?0.120) and target vessel revascularization (4.3% vs. 1.9%; adjusted HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.9?2.9, P?=?0.108) were statistically insignificant. Incidence, adjusted HR and P-value were similar between BARC and TIMI classification. Conclusions In-hospital bleeding events according to the newly proposed BARC definition were significantly associated with an increased risk of adverse long-term events in patients undergoing PCI with drug-eluting stents. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
