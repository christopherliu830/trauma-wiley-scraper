AB  - Summary Pulmonary embolism (PE) presents in a continuum of severity that spans from incidentally discovered subsegmental PE to massive PE resulting in cardiogenic shock and death. The main cause of death in patients with large PE is right ventricular failure, cardiogenic shock, and refractory hypoxemia. Rapid recanalization of the pulmonary arteries is the ultimate goal of all therapies for acute PE, regardless if pharmacologic, surgical, or catheter-based. All patients presenting with PE should be risk-stratified with the goal of: identifying patients who are at high risk of dying if they do not receive treatment with thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy; and identifying patients who are likely to develop chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Normotensive patients with acute PE who have any of the following factors at presentation are at increased risk of death and clinical deterioration: RV systolic dysfunction, RV dilatation, elevated plasma levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or evidence of myocardial injury.

AB  - Abstract Aims Left ventricular (LV) reverse remodelling is an important marker of improved outcomes in patients with advanced heart failure (HF). We examined the impact of the intramyocardial administration of bone-marrow-derived, lineage-directed, autologous cardiopoietic mesenchymal stem cells (C3BS-CQR-1) on LV remodelling in patients with advanced HF enrolled in the CHART-1 study. Methods and results Patients (n=351) with symptomatic advanced HF secondary to ischaemic heart disease, and reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF <35%) were randomized to receive C3BS-CQR-1 or a sham procedure. In a post hoc analysis we examined the effect of C3BS-CQR-1 on LV reverse remodelling within 1 year of the procedure and the influence of C3BS-CQR-1 dosing in the 271 patients treated as randomized. Delivery of C3BS-CQR-1 was associated with a progressive decrease in both LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and end-systolic volume (LVESV) within 52 weeks after treatment. At 1 year, the LVEDV and LVESV of treated patients decreased by 17.0 mL and 12.8 mL greater than controls (P=0.006 and P=0.017, respectively). The effect on LVEDV was maintained after multivariable adjustment for baseline age, systolic blood pressure, LVEDV, LVEF and history of myocardial infarction. The largest reverse remodelling was evident in the patients receiving a moderate number of injections (<20). Conclusion In CHART-1, intramyocardial administration of cardiopoietic stem cells led to reverse remodelling as evidenced by significant progressive decreases in LVEDV and LVESV through the 52 weeks of follow-up. Further studies are needed to explore the dose response with regard to cell number and injected volume, and reverse remodelling.

AB  - Abstract Objectives We evaluated healing responses with optical coherence tomography, and long-term clinical outcomes after treatment with a dedicated stent versus a conventional culotte technique. Background Dedicated bifurcation stents have been proposed as an alternative treatment for coronary bifurcation lesions. The long-term performance of dedicated stents versus conventional dual-stent techniques for the treatment of complex coronary bifurcation lesions is unknown. Methods Forty patients with true coronary bifurcation lesions were randomized to treatment with a dedicated Axxess bifurcation stent in the proximal main vessel and additional Biomatrix stents in branches versus culotte stenting using Xience stents. Results The percentage of uncovered struts in each bifurcation segment at 9 months (primary endpoint) was similar between groups. Five-year clinical follow-up was available for all patients and included major adverse cardiac events [MACE; a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR)], target-vessel (TVR) and non-target-vessel revascularization (non-TVR), non-TLR and stent thrombosis. At 5 years, in the culotte group, one patient had undergone TLR and another suffered a clinical MI, resulting in 10% MACE versus none in the Axxess group. TVR (5% vs. 10%, P?=?0.54) and non-TVR (5% vs. 20%, P?=?0.39) rates were similar between the Axxess and culotte groups, respectively. There was no stent thrombosis. Conclusion Compared with culotte stenting with Xience, complex coronary bifurcation stenting using a dedicated strategy combining the Axxess and Biomatrix stents results in similar stent strut coverage at 9 months, and excellent clinical outcomes at 5 years.

AB  - Abstract Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by severe congenital or immune-mediated deficiency in ADAMTS13, the enzyme that cleaves von Willebrand factor multimers. This rare condition leads invariably and rapidly to a fatal outcome in the absence of treatment, and therefore raises multiple diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The novel concepts and mechanisms identified in the laboratory for this disease have been rapidly and successfully translated into the clinic for the benefit of patients, making TTP an archetypal disease that has benefited from targeted therapies. After decades of empirical treatment with plasma exchange, identification of ADAMTS13 as the key enzyme involved in TTP pathophysiology provided an explanation for the remarkable efficacy of plasma administration, in which the missing enzyme is replenished, and paved the way for development of a recombinant form of the enzyme. Similarly, the demonstration of a major role of anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies through models of passive transfer of autoimmunity spurred development of immunomodulatory strategies based on B-cell depletion. More recently, an inhibitor of the platelet-von Willebrand factor interaction demonstrated efficacy in large clinical trials through prevention of formation of further microthrombi and protection of organs from ischemia. These translational breakthroughs in TTP are described in our review.

AB  - Summary We conducted a prospective study of non-cardiac surgical patients aged 70?years or more in 23 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. We studied 4158 consecutive patients of whom 2845 (68%) had pre-existing comorbidities. By day 30, 216 (5%) patients had died, and 835 (20%) suffered complications; 390 (9.4%) patients were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. Pre-operative factors associated with mortality included: increasing age (80?89?years: OR 2.1 (95% CI 1.6?2.8), p?<?0.001; 90+?years: OR 4.0 (95% CI 2.6?6.2), p?<?0.001); worsening ASA physical status (ASA 3: OR 3.1 (95% CI 1.8?5.5), p?<?0.001; ASA 4: OR 12.4 (95% CI 6.9?22.2), p?<?0.001); a pre-operative plasma albumin <?30?g.l?1 (OR: 2.5 (95% CI 1.8?3.5), p?<?0.001); and non-scheduled surgery (OR 1.8 (95% CI 1.3?2.5), p?<?0.001). Complications associated with mortality included: acute renal impairment (OR 3.3 (95% CI 2.1?5.0), p?<?0.001); unplanned Intensive Care Unit admission (OR 3.1 (95% CI 1.9?4.9), p?<?0.001); and systemic inflammation (OR 2.5 (95% CI 1.7?3.7), p?<?0.001). Patient factors often had a stronger association with mortality than the type of surgery. Strategies are needed to reduce complications and mortality in older surgical patients.
