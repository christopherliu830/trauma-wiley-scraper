AB  - Hydrogels are hydrophilic polymer-based materials with high water content and physical characteristics that resemble the native extracellular matrix. Because of their remarkable properties, hydrogel systems are used for a wide range of biomedical applications, such as three-dimensional (3D) matrices for tissue engineering, drug-delivery vehicles, composite biomaterials, and as injectable fillers in minimally invasive surgeries. In addition, the rational design of hydrogels with controlled physical and biological properties can be used to modulate cellular functionality and tissue morphogenesis. Here, the development of advanced hydrogels with tunable physiochemical properties is highlighted, with particular emphasis on elastomeric, light-sensitive, composite, and shape-memory hydrogels. Emerging technologies developed over the past decade to control hydrogel architecture are also discussed and a number of potential applications and challenges in the utilization of hydrogels in regenerative medicine are reviewed. It is anticipated that the continued development of sophisticated hydrogels will result in clinical applications that will improve patient care and quality of life.

AB  - While neurovascular diseases such as ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke are the leading causes of disability in the world, the repertoire of therapeutic interventions has remained remarkably limited. There is a dire need to develop new diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic options. The study of proteomics is particularly enticing for cerebrovascular diseases such as stroke, which most likely involve multiple gene interactions resulting in a wide range of clinical phenotypes. Currently, rapidly progressing neuroproteomic techniques have been employed in clinical and translational research to help identify biologically relevant pathways, to understand cerebrovascular pathophysiology, and to develop novel therapeutics and diagnostics. Future integration of proteomic with genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic studies will add new perspectives to better understand the complexities of neurovascular injury. Here, we review cerebrovascular proteomics research in both preclinical (animal, cell culture) and clinical (blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, microdialyates, tissue) studies. We will also discuss the rewards, challenges, and future directions for the application of proteomics technology to the study of various disease phenotypes. To capture the dynamic range of cerebrovascular injury and repair with a translational targeted and discovery approach, we emphasize the importance of complementing innovative proteomic technology with existing molecular biology models in preclinical studies, and the need to advance pharmacoproteomics to directly probe clinical physiology and gauge therapeutic efficacy at the bedside.

AB  - Abstract Rotational atherectomy is effective acutely in treating complex coronary disease, but less is known about its long-term clinical outcome. We examined the acute results and late clinical outcome in 178 patients undergoing treatment with this device. Rotational atherectomy was used to treat 240 lesions in 178 individual patients. Nineteen percent had multilesion or staged multivessel procedures, and 71% had AHA-ACC Type B2/C lesions. The procedure was completed successfully in 94% of patients. Major complications occurred in 6% (death 1%, Q-MI 2.8%, and emergency bypass surgery 2.2%). Clinical follow-up was available for 167 (94%) patients at 13 ± 6 months. Thirty-five percent required additional catheterization because of recurrent symptoms or an abnormal stress test. Clinical restenosis was confirmed in 18%, and an additional 2.2% of patients had progression of disease in previously untreated segments. At the end of 1 year, 14% had undergone repeat target vessel revascularization. Cumulatively at follow-up, approximately 80% had avoided an acute major complication and repeat revascularization for restenosis. Rotational atherectomy provides excellent acute and good late clinical results. At 1 year follow-up, the likelihood of developing clinical restenosis or significant progression of disease was 1 in 5, and patients had a 1 in 7 chance of requiring revascularization because of restenosis. These findings are encouraging and indicate that rotational atherectomy can be performed safely and with a high degree of acute and late clinical success in complex coronary disease characterized by multivessel or multilesion involvement and a predominance of B2 and C lesions.
