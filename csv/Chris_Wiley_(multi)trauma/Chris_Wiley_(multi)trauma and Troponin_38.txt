AB  - Background Acute myocardial infarctions (AMI) continue to be common in the United States. Mechanical complications of AMI can lead to cardiogenic shock (CS) and death. The aim of this study was to review the cases of papillary muscle ruptures in the setting of myocardial infarctions at a tertiary care center, with a focus on the clinical presentation and echocardiographic diagnosis. Methods This was a retrospective study from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2014. In all, 22 patients with AMI and papillary muscle rupture (AMI-PMR) who had surgical intervention were identified. Results The average age was 70 (±11) with 16 (73%) males. Six patients presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) and all underwent emergent revascularization with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) prior to the diagnosis of AMI-PMR. The other 16 patients presented with a non-STEMI. In total, 17 (77%) of the 22 patients were diagnosed with an AMI-PMR within 7 days from their onset of symptoms. In all, 12 patients (55%) had anterolateral papillary muscle ruptures (ALPMR), and the other 10 had posteromedial papillary muscle ruptures (PMPMR). Ruptures were complete in 10 patients (45%). Patients presented with pulmonary edema early (<7 days) more commonly than late (>14 days). Transthoracic echocardiography was able to demonstrate severe mitral regurgitation in 86% and a definitive or suggestive diagnosis in 93%. All 22 patients survived to operative management, and the overall in-hospital mortality rate was 9%. Conclusion In conclusion, ischemic papillary muscle ruptures continue to occur, but with prompt diagnosis by echocardiography and rapid surgical management, the mortality rate continues to decline.

AB  - Background: Due to the high prevalence of obesity in adults, nutrition support clinicians are encountering greater numbers of obese patients who require nutrition support during hospitalization. The purpose of this clinical guideline is to serve as a framework for the nutrition support care of adult patients with obesity. Method: A systematic review of the best available evidence to answer a series of questions regarding management of nutrition support in patients with obesity was undertaken and evaluated using concepts adopted from the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group. A consensus process, that includes consideration of the strength of the evidence together with the risks and benefits to the patient, was used to develop the clinical guideline recommendations prior to multiple levels of external and internal review and approval by the A.S.P.E.N. Board of Directors. Questions: (1) Do clinical outcomes vary across levels of obesity in critically ill or hospitalized non?intensive care unit (ICU) patients? (2) How should energy requirements be determined in obese critically ill or hospitalized non-ICU patients? (3) Are clinical outcomes improved with hypocaloric, high protein diets in hospitalized patients? (4) In obese patients who have had a malabsorptive or restrictive surgical procedure, what micronutrients should be evaluated?

AB  - Abstract Background The clinical relevance of bilateral pleural effusion (BPE) in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is unclear. Aims To describe characteristics of patients with acute PE that present with BPE. Methods Patients with acute PE were retrospectively analyzed and divided into three groups: without pleural effusion, unilateral pleural effusion, and bilateral effusion. Clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics were compared between the three groups. Results The study population (n=343) consisted of unilateral effusion group (n=83), BPE group (n=94) and without effusion group (n=166). Several variables were noted in higher proportion (%), in the BPE group in comparison to both the unilateral effusion and without effusion groups; Heart failure (17.0vs7.2vs6.7, p=0.017), Hypoalbuminemia (59.3vs39.5 vs25.6, p?0.001), PE occurrence in-hospital setting (51vs25.6vs15.1, p?0.001), major operation (31vs19.2vs15.2, p=0.01), and mechanical ventilation (13.0vs4.9vs4.2, p=0.019). Norton scale scores were found to be lower among patients with BPE in comparison to both patients with unilateral and without pleural effusion (15.55vs16.92vs17.36, p=0.006). After adjusting confounding variables, patients with BPE have lower probability for in-hospital survival in comparison to both patients with unilateral pleural effusion (OR=0.30, 95% CI [0.12,0.79]), and patients without pleural effusion (OR=0.26, 95% CI [0.11,0.61]). Conclusions BPE in patients with acute PE may have significant clinical implications. It may signify serious underlying comorbidities which contribute to higher in-hospital mortality in comparison to both patients with unilateral pleural effusion and patients without pleural effusion.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this randomized study was to assess whether direct stenting leads to less restenosis than does conventional stenting (CS) with predilation in clinical practice. We included 910 patients who were randomly assigned to undergo either direct stenting (DS; n = 456) or CS (n = 454). No significant difference was observed in the incidence of angiographic restenosis (primary endpoint): 23.6% for DS and 21.0% for CS (P = 0.41; relative risk = 1.1; 95% CI = 0.8?1.5). The incidence of target vessel revascularization was 17.3% among DS and 14.8% among CS patients (P = 0.29; relative risk = 1.2; 95% CI = 0.8?1.6). The combined incidence of death or myocardial infarction at one year was 9.0% in the DS group and 7.0% in the CS group (P = 0.28). In conclusion, direct stenting is not associated with any reduction of thrombotic and restenotic complications as compared to the conventional stenting.

AB  - Abstract Biomarkers have enormous potential to improve patient care by establishing tests of diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment effects. Successfully translating a biomarker from discovery to clinical application demands high-quality discovery research and high-quality clinical studies for biomarker validation; however, there are additional challenges that face biomarker research in pediatrics. There are also additional characteristics of pediatric medicine that make biomarker research especially needed. This review focuses on the fundamentals of biomarkers, the additional considerations needed for applying biomarker research to children, and recommendations for advancing pediatric biomarker research.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of the new Cobalt?Chromium (Co-Cr) Presillion? stent for the treatment of high-risk acute myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Background: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent represents the gold standard treatment for acute MI. Methods and Results: We enrolled patients with high-risk acute MI (either ST-segment elevation MI or non-ST-segment elevation MI) treated with PCI using a new Co-Cr bare metal stent with closed cells design and limited balloon compliance. We considered high-risk features as one of the following: age ≥70 years, ejection fraction ≤35%, glomerular filtration rate ≤60 mL/min, diabetes mellitus, rescue PCI, or chronic atrial fibrillation or other conditions requiring long-term oral anticoagulation therapy. Primary outcome of the study was rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined as all-cause death, new MI, and target-vessel revascularization. A total of 129 consecutive patients were enrolled (69 ± 11 years, 74% men): 71 (55%) patients with ST-segment elevation MI and 58 (45%) patients with non-ST-segment elevation MI. A total of 153 vessels (169 lesions and 179 stents) were treated. The device success rate was high (98.8%). In-hospital MACE rate was 5.4% mainly because of death associated with the acute MI. At 1-year follow-up, the MACE rate was 17.3%, with 11% all-cause death (7.9% of cardiac origin), 0.6% of stent thrombosis, and 4.6% target-vessel revascularization. Conclusions: The use of the Co-Cr Presillion stent in patients with high-risk acute MI treated invasively seems to be safe and efficacious with optimal deliverability and good long-term outcomes and represents a good option in the treatment of these patients. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Coronary fibromuscular dysplasia is uncommon, and even rarer its unstable and recurrent course. We present the unique case of a 52-year-old woman who underwent in total 12 coronary angiographies and three percutaneous coronary intervention within 24 months because of repetitive acute coronary syndromes due to refractory spasm, dissection, restenosis all leading to end-stage heart failure, and heart transplantation. The patient died 12 days after the heart transplantation complicated by intraoperative acute thrombotic occlusion of left anterior descending artery of the graft despite normal pretransplant coronary angiography. Autopsy of the recipient heart confirmed coronary fibromuscular dysplasia with massive intimal hyperplasia and restenosis.
