AB  - Aims Evaluation and management of patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the intensive care unit (ICU) are difficult. The use of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a quantitative marker of cardiac stress and heart failure (HF), may be helpful. The purpose of this study is to describe the prevalence of causative disorders of hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the ICU and to determine the impact of a BNP-guided diagnostic strategy. Methods and results This prospective, multi-centre, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial included 314 ICU patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure: 159 patients were randomly assigned to a diagnostic strategy involving the measurement of BNP and 155 were assessed in a standard manner. The time to discharge and the total cost of treatment were the primary endpoints. Hypoxaemic respiratory failure was multi-causal in 27% of the patients. Heart failure was the most common diagnosis in both groups. The use of BNP levels, in conjunction with other clinical information, significantly increased the detection of HF in combination with an additional diagnosis (32 vs. 16%, P = 0.001) and also increased the application of HF-specific medical therapy (nitrates: 32 vs. 23%, P < 0.05 and diuretics: 65 vs. 50%, P < 0.01). Time to discharge (median, 13 vs.14 days, P = 0.50) and total cost of treatment (median, US-$6190 vs. 7155, P = 0.24) were comparable in both groups. Conclusion Hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the ICU is often a multi-causal disorder. The use of BNP increased the detection of HF, but did not significantly improve patient management as quantified by time to discharge or treatment cost. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00130559.

AB  - Summary Chest pain and dyspnoea are among the most common complaints seen in the emergency department, accounting for nearly 20% of all visits. This chapter focuses on acute coronary syndrome, non-ischaemia-related chest pain, and congestive heart failure (CHF). In addition to ischemic heart disease, causes of chest pain may include pulmonary embolus, disorders of the pericardium, pleura and the chest wall, as well as oesophageal and spinal. A combination of focused cardiac and lung ultrasound can elucidate multiple causes of chest pain. Focused cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS) is useful in evaluating a variety of pathological conditions affecting the pericardium, especially pericardial effusion. In addition to heart failure, a number of disorders can cause dyspnoea, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pneumonia, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, deconditioning, metabolic acidosis, anxiety and many others. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) have been used for many years for distinguishing dyspnoea of pulmonary origin from that of cardiac origin.

AB  - 1 Tallie Z. Baram, 1 Kristen L. Brunson, 1 Celine Dube, 1 Sarit Avishai-Eliner, and 1 Kristina A. Fenoglio ( 1 Pediatrics, Anatomy/ Neurobiology, UCI, Irvine, CA ) Seizures often arise in the setting of an acute injury or insult. In addition, many of the epilepsies are ?symptomatic?, i.e., they occur in individuals who had sustained injury or insult such as infection, trauma, or stroke. The mechanisms by which diverse factors such as infection or trauma provoke both acute seizures and recurrent, chronic seizures (epilepsy) are not fully understood. To some extent, each of these insults may initiate a unique chain of events that promotes epilepsy. However, these insults also share commonalities that set in motion cellular and molecular changes that promote neuronal hyperexcitability: All these epilepsy- provoking insults are stressful, in that they trigger the release and actions of ?stress-mediating molecules?, including glucocorticoids and the intrinsic central nervous system (CNS) stress-activated neuro-peptide, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). Stress induces release of CRH from hippocampal interneurons, and CRH acts on selective receptors (CRF-R1) to enhance glutamate-mediated neurotransmission. In immature hippocampus, CRH and the CRH receptors are particularly abundant, so that the peptide may excite neurons sufficiently to evoke seizures, followed by dendritic atrophy or death of vulnerable neurons. In animal models, chronic enhancement of CRH levels within the developing hippocampus, may result in enduring reduction of hippocampus- governed learning and memory function. Such levels might be found in infants with chronic CNS stressors including congenital infection, dysplasia, trauma or recurrent seizures. Indeed, drugs that downregulate CRH levels in limbic structures (e.g., ACTH) are potent antiepileptics in the developing CNS. In summary, acute and chronic stress elicits the release of pro-excitatory molecules (CRH), promoting seizures. These further activate the ?stress response?, leading to a vicious cycle culminating in loss of neuronal function and integrity.

AB  - The editors of Academic Emergency Medicine are pleased and privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, May 16?19, 2007, in Chicago. The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.

AB  - In this special issue of Academic Emergency Medicine, the Editorial Board is privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM), May 22?25, 2000, San Francisco, CA. The depth, breadth, and future of our specialty and our practice are reflected in these brief research summaries; the creativity, talent, and dedication of our researcher colleagues are documented on these pages. We are honored to be able to share them with you. This year, 990 abstracts were received and considered for presentation at the Annual Meeting. Fifty percent were submitted electronically. Each abstract was evaluated by six to nine independent reviewers who were blinded to the author, the study institution, and the other reviewers. Final determinations for acceptance were made by members of the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by Judd Hollander, and the Program Committee chair, Sue Stern. These decisions were based on the mean score received after review and the space available for presentations within the program. The type of presentation (oral platform vs poster), the assigned topic section, and the position of presentation in the program were also determined. As was the case last year, we have reproduced these abstracts from electronic versions supplied by the submitting authors. In general, we have not edited, proofread, changed, or corrected the abstracts; they appear as submitted by the authors, who are responsible for their content. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. The institution listed is that of the presenting author. A list of common abbreviations used in the abstracts begins on page 596. An index to key words, authors, and topics begins on page 598.
