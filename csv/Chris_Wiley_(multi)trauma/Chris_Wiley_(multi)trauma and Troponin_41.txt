AB  - ABSTRACT Background Today, cardiologists seek to minimize time from symptom onset to interventional treatment for the most favorable results. Hypothesis In the acute coronary syndrome (ACS) symptom complex, sweating can differentiate ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) from non?ST-segment elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS) during early hours of infarction. Methods This single-center, prospective, observational study compared symptoms of STEMI and NSTE-ACS patients admitted from August 2012 to July 2014. Results Of 12 913 patients, 90.56% met ACS criteria. Among these, 22.51% had STEMI. Typical angina was the most common symptom (83.82%). On stepwise multiple regression, sweating (odds ratio: 97.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 82.16-114.14, P < 0.0001) and typical angina (odds ratio: 2.72, 95% CI: 2.18-3.38, P < 0.001) had significant association with STEMI. For diagnosis of STEMI, positive likelihood ratio (LR) and positive predictive value (PPV) were highest for typical angina with sweating (LR: 11.17, 95% CI: 10.31-12.1; PPV: 76.09, 95% CI: 74.37-77.75), followed by sweating with atypical angina (LR: 3.6, 95% CI: 3.07-4.21; PPV: 50.61, 95% CI: 46.45-54.76), typical angina (LR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.03-1.07; PPV: 22.97, 95% CI: 22.11-23.84), and atypical angina (LR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.69-0.87; PPV: 18.09, 95% CI: 16.32-19.97). C statistic values of 0.859 for typical angina with sweating and 0.519 for typical angina alone reflected high discriminatory value of sweating for STEMI prediction. Conclusions Presence of sweating with ACS symptoms predicts probability of STEMI, even before clinical confirmation. Sweating in association with typical or atypical angina is a much better predictor of STEMI than NSTE-ACS.

AB  - Abstract Aim This research protocol describes and justifies a study to assess patients' cardiac-related beliefs (i.e. illness representations, knowledge/misconceptions, cardiac treatment beliefs), motivation and mood over time to predict non-attendance at a cardiac rehabilitation programme by measuring weekly/monthly changes in these key variables. Background Heart disease is the UK's leading cause of death. Evidence from meta-analyses suggests that cardiac rehabilitation facilitates recovery following acute cardiac events. However, 30?60% of patients do not attend cardiac rehabilitation. There is some evidence from questionnaire studies that a range of potentially modifiable psychological variables including patients' cardiac-related beliefs, motivation and mood may influence attendance. Design Mixed-methods. Methods In this study, during 2012?2013, electronic diary data will be gathered weekly/monthly from 240 patients with acute coronary syndrome from discharge from hospital until completion of the cardiac rehabilitation programme. This will identify changes and interactions between key variables over time and their power to predict non-attendance at cardiac rehabilitation. Data will be analysed to examine the relationship between patients' illness perceptions, cardiac treatment beliefs, knowledge/misconceptions, mood and non-attendance of the cardiac rehabilitation programme. The qualitative component (face-to-face interviews) seeks to explore why patients decide not to attend, not complete or complete the cardiac rehabilitation programme. Discussion The identification of robust predictors of (non-)attendance is important for the design and delivery of interventions aimed at optimizing cardiac rehabilitation uptake. Funding for the study was granted in February 2011 by the Scottish Government Chief Scientist Office (CZH/4/650).

AB  - Abstract It is difficult to convey the accelerating rate and growing importance of mass spectrometry applications to human blood proteins and peptides. Mass spectrometry can rapidly detect and identify the ionizable peptides from the proteins in a simple mixture and reveal many of their post-translational modifications. However, blood is a complex mixture that may contain many proteins first expressed in cells and tissues. The complete analysis of blood proteins is a daunting task that will rely on a wide range of disciplines from physics, chemistry, biochemistry, genetics, electromagnetic instrumentation, mathematics and computation. Therefore the comprehensive discovery and analysis of blood proteins will rank among the great technical challenges and require the cumulative sum of many of mankind's scientific achievements together. A variety of methods have been used to fractionate, analyze and identify proteins from blood, each yielding a small piece of the whole and throwing the great size of the task into sharp relief. The approaches attempted to date clearly indicate that enumerating the proteins and peptides of blood can be accomplished. There is no doubt that the mass spectrometry of blood will be crucial to the discovery and analysis of proteins, enzyme activities, and post-translational processes that underlay the mechanisms of disease. At present both discovery and quantification of proteins from blood are commonly reaching sensitivities of ?1?ng/mL. ? 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 30:685?732, 2011

AB  - Abstract Epigenetics is the study of gene expression changes that occur in the absence of altered genotype. Current evidence indicates a role for environmentally induced alterations to epigenetic modifications leading to health and disease changes across multiple generations. This phenomenon is called intergenerational or transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of health or disease. Environmental insults, in the form of toxins, plastics and particular dietary interventions, perturb the epigenetic landscape and influence the health of F1 through to F4 generations in rodents. There is, however, the possibility that healthy lifestyles and environmental factors, such as exercise training, could lead to favourable, heritable epigenetic modifications that augment transcriptional programmes protective of disease, including metabolic dysfunction, heart disease and cancer. The health benefits conferred by regular physical exercise training are unquestionable, yet many of the molecular changes may have heritable health implications for future generations. Similar to other environmental factors, exercise modulates the epigenome of somatic cells and researchers are beginning to study exercise epigenetics in germ cells. The germ cell epigenetic modifications affected by exercise offer a molecular mechanism for the inheritance of health and disease risk. The aims of this review are to: (i) provide an update on the expanding field of exercise epigenetics; (ii) offer an overview of data on intergenerational/transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of disease by environmental insults; (iii) to discuss the potential of exercise-induced intergenerational inheritance of health and disease risk; and finally, outline potential mechanisms and avenues for future work on epigenetic inheritance through exercise.

AB  - Repair of damaged skeletal-muscle tissue is limited by the regenerative capacity of the native tissue. Current clinical approaches are not optimal for the treatment of large volumetric skeletal-muscle loss. As an alternative, tissue engineering represents a promising approach for the functional restoration of damaged muscle tissue. A typical tissue-engineering process involves the design and fabrication of a scaffold that closely mimics the native skeletal-muscle extracellular matrix (ECM), allowing organization of cells into a physiologically relevant 3D architecture. In particular, anisotropic materials that mimic the morphology of the native skeletal-muscle ECM, can be fabricated using various biocompatible materials to guide cell alignment, elongation, proliferation, and differentiation into myotubes. Here, an overview of fundamental concepts associated with muscle-tissue engineering and the current status of muscle-tissue-engineering approaches is provided. Recent advances in the development of anisotropic scaffolds with micro- or nanoscale features are reviewed, and how scaffold topographical, mechanical, and biochemical cues correlate to observed cellular function and phenotype development is examined. Finally, some recent developments in both the design and utility of anisotropic materials in skeletal-muscle-tissue engineering are highlighted, along with their potential impact on future research and clinical applications.
