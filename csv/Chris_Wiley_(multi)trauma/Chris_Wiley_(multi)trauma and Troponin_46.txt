AB  - Abstract Objectives Factors associated with performing urgent coronary angiography (UCA) in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) were identified. Background Current guidelines for resuscitated OHCA patients recommend UCA if there is ST-elevation on post-arrest electrocardiogram or high suspicion of acute myocardial infarction. Some have advocated for UCA in all OHCA regardless of suspected etiology. The reasons for variations in performing UCA are not well understood. Methods A retrospective analysis of subjects presenting with resuscitated OHCA to a single academic medical center from 12/15/2007 to 8/31/2014 was conducted. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients undergoing UCA, defined as angiography within 6 hr of presentation, were compared with those not undergoing UCA. Logistic regression was used to determine predictors of UCA. Results A total of 323 resuscitated OHCA patients (mean age, 64 years; women, 35%) were included in the analysis; 107 (33.1%) underwent coronary angiography during their hospitalization and 66 (20.4%) underwent UCA. Multivariable adjusted factors associated with UCA were ST-elevation [odds ratio (OR) 14.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.28?34.24, P?<?0.001], initial shockable rhythm (OR 3.69, 95% CI 1.52?8.97, P?=?0.004), and history of coronary artery disease (CAD) (OR 3.37, 95% CI 1.43?7.95, P?=?0.005). Higher age (OR 0.71 per decade, 95% CI 0.55?0.92, P?=?0.01) and obvious non-cardiac cause of arrest (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02?0.38, P?=?0.001) were negatively associated with UCA. Conclusions In resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients, ST-elevation, shockable rhythm, and history of CAD were associated with performing urgent coronary angiography; older patients and those with obvious non-cardiac causes of arrest were negatively associated.

AB  - The severe shortage of donor hearts limits the availability of transplantation for the growing population of patients with end-stage heart disease. We examined national trends in donor heart acceptance for transplant. OPTN data were analyzed for all potential adult cardiac organ donors between 1995 and 2010. Donor heart disposition was categorized as transplanted, declined for transplant or other. We studied changes in the probability of donor heart acceptance according to demographic and clinical characteristics, nationwide and by UNOS region. Of 82?053 potential donor hearts, 34% were accepted and 48% were declined (18% used for other purposes). There was a significant decrease in donor heart acceptance from 44% in 1995 to 29% in 2006, and subsequent increase to 32% in 2010. Older donor age, female sex and medical co-morbidities predicted non-acceptance. Donor age and co-morbidities increased during the study period, with a concomitant decrease in acceptance of hearts from donors with undesirable characteristics. Overall, predictors of heart non-use were similar across UNOS regions, although utilization varied between regions. Regional variation suggests a potential to improve heart acceptance rates in under-performing regions, and supports research and policy efforts aimed at establishing evidence-based criteria for donor heart evaluation and acceptance for transplantation.

AB  - Abstract Background A recently published randomized control trial (RCT) showed a protection of the remnant liver from ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury by pharmacological pre-conditioning with a volatile anaesthetic in patients undergoing hepatic resection. Whether the continuous application of volatile anaesthetics (pharmacological conditioning) also protects against I/R injury is unknown. Methods Consecutive patients undergoing liver resection with inflow occlusion from 2005?2007 were included in the trial. Two groups of anaesthesia regimens with either continuous application of the volatile anaesthetic sevoflurane (pharmacological conditioning) or continuous infusion of the intravenous (i.v.) anaesthetic propofol (control group) were compared. Endpoints were serum-peak-aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ alanine aminotranferease (ALT) levels, length of stay (LOS) and intensive care unit (ICU) stays, and the occurrence of post-operative complications. Results Two hundred and twenty-seven patients were included. Pharmacological conditioning did not protect the remnant liver from IR injury (adjusted difference for peak-AST:61.9?U/l, 95% confidence interval (CI): ?151.7?275.4?U/l, P = 0.568; peak-ALT:136.1?U/l, 95% CI: ?113.7?385.9?U/l, P = 0.284) nor reduce LOS (adjusted difference 0.9 days, 95% CI: ?2.6?4.3 days, P = 0.622) or ICU stay (1.6 days, 95% CI: ?0.2?3.3 days, P = 0.079), and was not associated with reduced complication rates (adjusted OR 1.12, 95% CI:0.6?2.3, P = 0.761) compared with the control group. Conclusion In this retrospective study, continuous volatile anaesthesia in liver resection does not provide protection of the remnant liver from IR injury compared with continuous i.v. anaesthesia.

AB  - Summary We conducted a systematic review of the effects of dexmedetomidine on cardiac outcomes following non-cardiac surgery. We included prospective, randomised peri-operative studies of dexmedetomidine that reported mortality, cardiac morbidity or adverse drug events. A PubMed Central and EMBASE search was conducted up to July 2007. The reference lists of identified papers were examined for further trials. Of 425 studies identified, 20 were included in the meta-analysis (840 patients). Dexmedetomidine was associated with a trend towards improved cardiac outcomes; all-cause mortality (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.01?7.13, p?=?0.44), non-fatal myocardial infarction (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.04?1.60, p?=?0.14), and myocardial ischaemia (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.26?1.63, p?=?0.36). Peri-operative hypotension (26%, OR 3.80, 95% CI 1.91?7.54, p?=?0.0001) and bradycardia (17%, OR 5.45, 95% CI 2.98?9.95, p?<?0.00001) were significantly increased. An anticholinergic did not reduce the incidence of bradycardia (p?=?0.43). A randomised placebo-controlled trial of dexmedetomidine is warranted.
