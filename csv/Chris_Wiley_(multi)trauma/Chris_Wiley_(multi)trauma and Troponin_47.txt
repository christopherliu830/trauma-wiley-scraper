AB  - Summary It has recently been appreciated that patients with severe sepsis and septic shock suffer from altered innate and adaptive immune responses, leading to an impaired clearance of microorganisms. This explains their difficulty to fight their primary bacterial infection and their propensity to develop superinfections. A depressed immunological surveillance in some of these patients is also responsible for a reactivation of dormant viruses, such as cytomegalovirus. Leukocyte functions are profoundly affected during sepsis. Circulating phagocytes show a marked decrease in their capacity to mount a proinflammatory reaction in response to microorganisms. Monocytes express low levels of major histocompatibility class II molecules. These phenotypic changes are known as ?immune paralysis?. Massive lymphocyte and dendritic cell apoptosis has also been reported in patients dying of sepsis, responsible, at least in part, for the impairment of adaptive responses. This was highlighted by the defective skin tests to common antigens documented already three decades ago in patients with sepsis. Patients with severe sepsis and septic shock may therefore benefit from treatments aimed at stimulating innate and adaptive immune responses. The aims of immune stimulation are: (1) to help bacterial killing at the primary focus of infection; (2) to prevent the development of nosocomial infections; and (3) to prevent the reactivation of dormant viruses. Therapeutic strategies based on ?boosting? immune responses with interferon ?, G-CSF, and more recently with GM-CSF have been initiated. Although results of pilot studies are encouraging, these will need to be confirmed in larger clinical studies. As a word of caution, one should not induce deleterious overwhelming inflammatory reactions, and therefore close monitoring of immune and inflammatory responses during immune stimulation therapy is necessary.

AB  - Summary Nonpruritic spontaneous alopecia is uncommon in pet rats, except in animals with hereditary hypotrichosis, in which permanent hair loss is expected. Differential diagnoses for alopecia with pruritus include external parasitism, dermatophytosis, bacterial dermatitis, hyperadrenocorticism, neoplasia, and hypersensitivity reactions. A biopsy of the affected section will often assist with determining the etiology of the alopecia. Rats are susceptible to a range of endocrine-related diseases and tumors; however, these are recognized infrequently and not often treated in pet animals. Sex and strain or breed are important disease predisposition determinants for endocrine conditions; however, genetic background can be much more difficult to ascertain in pet rats. The most common mass seen in the brain of rats is the pituitary adenoma. Other spontaneous intracerebral tumors are highly uncommon. Of those described, astrocytoma, granular cell tumor, glial tumors, and meningioma are the most common.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intracoronary administration of prourokinase via balloon catheter during primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Methods Acute STEMI patients underwent primary PCI were randomly divided into two groups: intracoronary prourokinase (IP) group (n?=?118) and control group (n?=?112). During primary PCI, prourokinase or saline were injected to the distal end of the culprit lesion via balloon catheter after balloon catheter dilatation. Demographic and clinical characteristics, infarct size, myocardial reperfusion, and cardiac functions were evaluated and compared between two groups. Hemorrhagic complications and MACE occurred in the 6-months follow up were recorded. Results No significant differences were observed between two groups with respect to baseline demographic, clinical, and angiographic characteristics (P?>?0.05). In IP group, more patients had complete ST segment resolution (>70%) compared with control group (P?<?0.05). Patients in IP group showed lower levels of serum CK, CK-MB and TnI, and a much higher myocardial blood flow (MBF) than those in control group (P?<?0.05). No significant differences of TIMI major or minor bleeding complications were observed between the two groups (P?>?0.05). At 6-months follow-up, there was a trend that patients in the IP group had a less chance to have MACE, though it was not statistically different (8.5% vs 12.5%, P?>?0.05). Conclusions Intracoronary administration of prourokinase via balloon catheter during primary PCI effectively improved myocardial perfusion in STEMI patients.
