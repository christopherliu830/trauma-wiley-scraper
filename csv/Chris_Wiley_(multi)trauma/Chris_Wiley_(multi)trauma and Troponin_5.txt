AB  - Abstract Introduction There is limited evidence regarding clinical research priorities in emergency medicine outside of some special interest groups. The ACEM Clinical Trials Group undertook a consensus meeting with the aim of developing a reproducible weighting matrix for assessing clinical research priorities. Methods A session at the ACEM annual scientific meeting was dedicated to this meeting. Results from a survey of the ACEM researcher database were presented, along with a proposed weighting matrix. After discussion and adjustment, consensus was achieved on the matrix. Results It was agreed that the following criteria be used in the matrix: research category and sub-category priority ranking from the ACEM researcher database survey, frequency of presentation of potentially eligible participants, the level of pre-existing evidence regarding the proposed research question and the likely clinical impact of the research. Each criterion was given a weighting, with clinical impact given the heaviest weighting. The weighting matrix was subsequently applied to the list of research questions that resulted from the researcher database survey and a list of research priorities determined. Conclusion The weighting matrix allows reproducible comparison of research questions. The resultant list of research priorities will act as a guide for the ACEM Clinical Trials Group in determining future projects.

AB  - Abstract The most radical treatment currently available for severe heart failure is heart transplantation; however, the number of donor hearts is limited. A better approach is to make human cardiac tissues. We developed an original cell sheet-based tissue-engineering technology to fabricate human cardiac tissue by layering myocardial cell sheets. Human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells were differentiated into cardiomyocytes to fabricate cardiomyocyte sheets. Initially, three-layer human iPS cardiomyocyte (hiPSCM) sheets were transplanted on subcutaneous tissues of nude rats. Next, to fabricate thicker tissue, three-layer sheets were transplanted on one day, then additional three-layer sheets were transplanted onto them the following day, after the first sheets were vascularized. On day 3, the final three-layer sheets were again transplanted, creating a nine-layer graft (multi-step transplantation procedure). In the last step, six-layer sheets were transplanted on fat tissues of the inguinal portion, which were subsequently resected together with the femoral arteries and veins to make transplantable grafts with connectable vessels. They were then transplanted ectopically to the neck portion of other rats by anastomosing vessels with the host's jugular arteries and veins. Transplanted three-layer hiPSCMs were beating and, histologically, showed a cardiac muscle-like structure with vascular systems. Moreover, transplanted hiPSCMs proliferated and matured in vivo. Significantly thicker tissues were fabricated by a multi-step transplantation procedure. The ectopically transplanted graft survived and continued to beat. We succeeded in fabricating functional human cardiac tissue with cell sheet technology. Transplanting this cardiac tissue may become a new treatment option for severe heart failure.

AB  - The administration of MPSS is advocated both for limiting spinal cord injury from Hansen Type I intervertebral disk protrusion (T1-IVD) and from the potential surgical trauma associated with laminectomy. Recent studies suggest that treatment with MPSS does not significantly alter functional outcome and is associated with significant complications including gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic necrosis, and increased rates of infection. The purpose of this prospective study was to report the results of laminectomy without MPSS treatment in non-ambulatory dogs with T1-IVD. The study group involved dogs weighing less than 15?kg that had a laminectomy between T11-T12 and L4-L5 for T1-IVD. Dogs included had not been treated with MPSS, were unable to walk but able to sense ?deep pain?. The dogs were evaluated post-operatively for the ability to walk (stand and advance pelvic limbs), pain (reaction to paraspinal palpation or movement), and incontinence (dribbling urine/feces or failure to completely void urine). Fifty-one dogs met the inclusion criteria. Prior to surgery 0% of the dogs could walk (26 paralyzed, 25 paretic), and 98% were painful. Incontinence was not assessed or was unknown in most cases. Ten days following surgery, 90% were walking, 98% were pain-free, and 82% were fully continent. By 6 weeks, 100% were walking, 6% were painful, and 86% fully continent. By 16 weeks, 96% were pain-free, and 88% were fully continent. These results obtained with laminectomy alone are comparable or superior to reports of those with MPSS administration and suggest that MPSS is not necessary for a successful outcome in dogs receiving laminectomy for T1-IVD.

AB  - A simple technique for autotransfusion has been developed and used in the successful resuscitation of dogs suffering severe trauma and /or hemorrhage. The purpose of this abstract is three-fold: 1) Describe the criteria used in case selection; 2) Describe the method used; and 3) Describe the results of its use in a limited number of cases. Case Selection: The criteria used were the following: 1. Ongoing significant hemorrhage or severe hemorrhage noted in a body cavity where the blood could be collected; 2. Acute hemorrhage amounts deemed to be life-threatening (>40% calculated blood volume [88?ml/kg]); 3. Where other choices (fresh or stored homologus blood, Oxyglobin) in amounts needed were not possible. Method: Blood was aspirated into a suction canister using a Pool or Yankauer suction tip, with the tip placed under the pool (s) of blood to eliminate as many bubbles in the collection process as possible. If the canister was not sterilized it was scrubbed with a surgical prep solution and then rinsed with tap water prior to blood collection. The blood in the canister was poured into a wide opening in a hanging empty plastic intravenous fluid bag with a blood administration set inserted. The blood was intravenously administered by gravity drip as needed. No attempt was made to use any anticoagulant. Amounts of blood given, clinical responses, and complications were recorded. Results: The procedure was used in 12 dogs: 5 abdominal hemorrhage, 3 thoracic hemorrhage, 2 hemorrhage from both abdomen and chest, 2 vertebral vein hemorrhage. All blood administered was given during the operation or within 2 hours. Amounts transfused ranged from 30 to 120?ml/kg (body weight [mean 48?ml/kg]). No animals died acutely from signs thought to be associated with the transfusion of this blood. Those cases surviving to discharge were 4 abdominal, 2 thoracic, 1 combined, and 1 vertebral vein. There were no infections attributed to the autotransfusion. It is concluded that this technique can be recommended and may be considered life-saving in selected cases.

AB  - Summary Endocrine causes of hypertensive emergencies are easily overlooked when patients present with uncontrolled hypertension in association with evidence of end-organ damage. Emergencies arising from hypertensive crises due to pheochromocytoma can be particularly dangerous. To ensure appropriate therapeutic counter-measures and a favorable outcome, the presence of a catecholamine-producing tumor should be distinguished from more common etiologies as well as other uncommon endocrine causes, such as primary hyperaldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, and thyrotoxicosis. However, diagnosis at the time of the emergency can be made difficult by activation of the sympathoadrenal system resulting from the physiological stress of the clinical condition. Tests of catecholamine excess are therefore rendered problematic to interpret, with reliable diagnosis often only possible once and if the patient recovers. Because of this and time delays in obtaining test results, recognition of a possible endocrine cause in the emergency setting requires careful attention to patient history, presentation, and precipitating causes that may provide clues to underlying etiologies to guide therapeutic interventions.
