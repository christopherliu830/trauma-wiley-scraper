AB  - Summary Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) hold great promise to provide important new therapeutic approaches in treating age-associated diseases and other medical conditions due to their unique capacity for self-renewal, their pluripotency and their ability to differentiate into a broad variety of cell types. To date, numerous hESC lines have been developed and characterised. We discuss here how hESC lines are derived, their molecular and cellular properties, and how their ability to differentiate into all three embryonic germ layers is determined. We highlight some of the challenges that must be overcome to obtain and evaluate therapeutic populations from hESCs and the strategies that are being developed to enable the use of hESC-derived cell populations in clinical applications. We conclude with a discussion of clinical trials that are beginning to provide evidence for the therapeutic potential of tissue-specific differentiated populations derived from human embryonic stem cells.

AB  - Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most frequent cause of dementia, is escalating as a global epidemic, and so far, there is neither cure nor treatment to alter its progression. The most important feature of the disease is neuronal death and loss of cognitive functions, caused probably from several pathological processes in the brain. The main neuropathological features of AD are widely described as amyloid beta (A?) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of the aggregated protein tau, which contribute to the disease. Nevertheless, AD brains suffer from a variety of alterations in function, such as energy metabolism, inflammation and synaptic activity. The latest decades have seen an explosion of genes and molecules that can be employed as targets aiming to improve brain physiology, which can result in preventive strategies for AD. Moreover, therapeutics using these targets can help AD brains to sustain function during the development of AD pathology. Here, we review broadly recent information for potential targets that can modify AD through diverse pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches including gene therapy. We propose that AD could be tackled not only using combination therapies including A? and tau, but also considering insulin and cholesterol metabolism, vascular function, synaptic plasticity, epigenetics, neurovascular junction and blood?brain barrier targets that have been studied recently. We also make a case for the role of gut microbiota in AD. Our hope is to promote the continuing research of diverse targets affecting AD and promote diverse targeting as a near-future strategy.

AB  - Selenium is a component of selenoproteins with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), multiorgan dysfunction (MOD), and multiorgan failure (MOF) are associated with an early reduction in plasma selenium and glutathione peroxidase activity (GPx), and both parameters correlate inversely with the severity of illness and outcomes. Several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluated selenium therapy as monotherapy or in antioxidant cocktails in intensive care unit (ICU) patient populations, and more recently several meta-analyses suggested benefits with selenium therapy in the most seriously ill patients. However, the largest RCT on pharmaconutrition with glutamine and antioxidants, the REducing Deaths due to Oxidative Stress (REDOXS) Study, was unable to find any improvement in clinical outcomes with antioxidants provided by the enteral and parenteral route and suggested harm in patients with renal dysfunction. Subsequently, the MetaPlus study demonstrated increased mortality in medical patients when provided extra glutamine and selenium enterally. The treatment effect of selenium may be dependent on the dose, the route of administration, and whether administered with other nutrients and the patient population studied. Currently, there are few small studies evaluating the pharmacokinetic profile of intravenous (IV) selenium in SIRS, and therefore more data are necessary, particularly in patients with MOD, including those with renal dysfunction. According to current knowledge, high-dose pentahydrate sodium selenite could be given as an IV bolus injection (1000?2000 µg), which causes transient pro-oxidant, cytotoxic, and anti-inflammatory effects, and then followed by a continuous infusion of 1000?1600 µg/d for up to 10?14 days. Nonetheless, the optimum dose and efficacy still remain controversial and need to be definitively established.

AB  - The present review aimed to summarize the effectiveness and features of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the treatment of infectious diseases and to discuss the limitation of the development of TCM. The personalized medicine with TCM exerts a curative effect on viral and bacterial infectious diseases with unique advantages on the improvement of clinical manifestation, pathogen inhibition, and organ recovery during severe and drug-resistant infection. The deficiency of personalized medicine with TCM lies in that the current research design of TCM primarily focuses on the study of the effective components and material basis of Chinese herbs at the cellular, molecular, and genetic level, while ignoring the guidance of the TCM syndrome differentiation theory, which is the core concept of individualized treatment. Personalized medicine with TCM has a broad prospective for infectious diseases due to the specific efficacy and advantages. While the curative effect of individualized treatment with TCM cannot be excluded from the TCM syndrome differentiation theory, the study of personalized medicine with TCM for infectious diseases urgently requires a unified standardization of the clinical syndrome differentiation and the evolution rule of infectious diseases by TCM theory.

One of the most classical and common examples of a ?generalized? seizure type is absence seizures, which are characterized by abruptly commencing bihemispheric synchronous spike and wave discharges on the EEG. However evidence is accumulating that absence seizures may actually commence in a geographically localized ?focus? within the somatosensory cortex. Most of this data comes from electrophysiological studies in genetic models, but there is some emerging data from electrophysiological and functional imaging studies in human with absence epilepsies. The proposed workshop will present and discuss data relating to the localization, neurophysiology and underlying pathological basis of the generator of absence seizures in the cortex of rodents, as well as debate the evidence that this may be translatable to human suffers of these absence epilepsies. Gilles van Luijtelaar will discuss ?Neurophysiological and morphological evidence for the cortical absence seizure focus in the WAG/Rij rat?. Didier Pinault will discuss ?Layer VI pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex generate spike-and-wave discharges in GAERS?. Graeme Jackson will discuss ?The evidence for a cortical absence seizure focus in humans: electrophysiological and imaging studies?. John Huguenard will be the discussant.

AB  - Ingrid E. Scheffer ? Austin Health, University of Melbourne, West Heidelberg, VIC, Australia Summary: Until now, the discovery of genes for monogenic epilepsies has not had significant clinical impact. With the finding that around 70% of children with Dravet syndrome, or severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, have mutations of SCN1A, epilepsy genetics has moved into the clinical domain. Recognition of Dravet syndrome requires an understanding of a complex phenotype including seizure onset in the first year of life, multiple seizure types, developmental slowing, neurological deficits and EEG features. Genotype-phenotype correlation has led to the identification of novel SCN1A epileptic encephalopathies such as severe infantile multifocal epilepsy that should also be considered for mutational analysis. Translational research with the development of animal models of SCN1A mutations has led to significant insights into the neurobiology of Dravet syndrome. SCN1A knockout mice recapitulate the human disorder with seizures and ataxia leading to early death in heterozygotes. Mice show strain-specific penetrance of disease reflecting the genetic background effects that modify phenotypic severity in humans. Cellular studies show that dysfunction of the interneuron in cortex, rather than excitatory cells, underlies the phenotype. GABAergic cells are also implicated in the cerebellum with Purkinje cell dysfunction underlying ataxia. The diagnostic finding of a SCN1A mutation associated with Dravet syndrome or a related phenotype has major implications for treatment, prognostic and genetic counseling. Specific antiepileptic agents are effective in Dravet syndrome whilst others cause seizure exacerbation. Stiripentol has been shown to be effective in Dravet syndrome. Early diagnosis allows the clinician to optimise anti-epileptic therapy with the aim of improving developmental outcome.

An optimal therapy is lacking, and to date there has been no animal model that sufficiently replicates clinical features, so our understanding of mechanism is incomplete. Existing therapies are limited by effectiveness, availability or both. Yet, each of these challenges offers a unique opportunity to advance clinical and basic knowledge of this developmental epilepsy. This symposium will discuss recent advances about the clinical profile, therapeutic modalities, outcome, and mechanisms of infantile spasms. Dr. Nordli will review infantile spasms presentations and clinial features, especially variants. Dr. Lux will discuss current and future treatments. Dr. Carmant will discuss outcomes of infantile spasms. Finally, Dr. Stafstrom will consider emerging animal models that might shed light on infantile spasms mechanisms.
