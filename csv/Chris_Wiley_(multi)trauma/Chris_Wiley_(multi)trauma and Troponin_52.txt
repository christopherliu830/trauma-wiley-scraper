AB  - Dennis Spencer ? Dept of Neurosurgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT Summary: Advances in clinical care for our patients with epilepsy depends on creative problem solving in research.,which frequently comes only when technology provides exactly the right tool for the solution. Our presidential symposium this year highlights four fields in neuroengineering that have already changed how we diagnose and treat patients but promise to further revolutionize not only our understanding of disease mechanisms but also normal brain function. Hoby Heatherington will describe why more powerful high field strength MR is the key to unlocking the spectroscopic chemical analysis of the normal and metabolically deranged brain with epilepsy. Karl Deisseroth utilizes optical and stem-cell based technology for noninvasive imaging and control of brain circuitry. He will describe how this technology probes normal neural circuit dynamics and what it may promise in the treatment of epilepsy and other neurological disorders. Itzak Fried has coupled the technology of microelectrode recordings of human hippocampal ictal events to cognitive challenges that have provided rare insights into how the human hippocampus functions under normal conditions and the stress of epileptogenesis. Finally David Roberts will guide us through the history and the future of how the computer, mathematics and imaging has revolutionized the neurosurgeon's stereotactic approach to intracranial electrophysiological diagnosis and precise delivery of future therapies.

Four investigators from the fields of molecular neuroscience, thalamocortical network physiology, transgenic animal physiology/behavior, and human/animal neuroimaging will serve as workshop speakers. To provide a basis for discussion, the speakers will use the first half of their presentation time to describe the relevant work from their respective laboratories. In the second half of their allotted presentation time, the speakers and workshop attendees will discuss how the results obtained in the speaker's experimental system address questions of IGE ictogenesis and epileptogenesis and complement the work done in other experimental systems. Participants will also use this time to ?workshop? new experiments that could be performed within the speaker's area of scientific expertise that would answer questions deemed important to IGE investigators from all disciplines.

AB  - Abstract A systems-level model analysis of neuromuscular response to external electrical stimulation is presented. Action potential (AP) generation, dynamics of voltage-based calcium release at the motor endplates controlled by the arrival of APs, and muscle force production are all comprehensively included. Numerical predictions exhibit trends that are qualitatively similar to measurements of muscle response in rats from a burst of cortical stimulation and a nanosecond impulse. Modulation of neural membrane conductances (including possible electroporation) that alters the neural impulse generation frequency is hypothesized as a possible mechanism leading to observed changes in muscle force production. Other possibilities such as calcium release at nerve end endings also exist. It is also proposed that multipulsing strategies and changing the electric field direction by using multielectrode systems would be useful.

AB  - Summary Organ transplantation has increased in scope, volume and complexity over the past decades, and the number and the potency of immunosuppressive drugs have increased concomitantly. Patient and graft survival has improved in parallel and with it the expectations for success. Still, allografts are lost for various reasons, and perfection remains elusive. Since organ transplantation is a complex procedure where many subspecialties are involved, quality assessment is mandatory to improve and maintain success rates. Quality comprises not only the surgical and medical part of transplantation. Many other disciplines such as transplant immunology, hygiene, pathology and clinical chemistry are part of the transplant team and require quality standards. Quality standards also include the organ procurement in terms of reducing the time on the waiting list as well as the quality of organ procurement. An underappreciated quality marker is the rate at which a patient gets access to the transplant waiting list. This chapter will provide a listing of the indices that should be continuously assayed to insure sustenance and improvement of a transplant center's outcomes.

AB  - Summary Pacemakers are used for the treatment of bradyarrhythmias in dogs and cats. These include high-grade second-degree atrioventricular block, third-degree atrioventricular block, sick sinus syndrome, persistent atrial standstill and occasionally neurocardiogenic (vasovagal) syncope. The pacemaker consists of a battery (or generator) and a lead that senses activity and then delivers the current if appropriate to the heart. The battery is normally implanted under the skin in the neck, and the lead is placed inside the right ventricle via the jugular vein. It delivers a shock directly to the ventricular myocardium, causing it to depolarise and hence contract. It is important that the system is able to sense the heart's intrinsic activity, which inhibits generator function, thereby avoiding depolarisation during an intrinsic complex. Results are usually excellent, with over 95% of dogs surviving pacemaker implantation and one year survival of 86?70%. However, 3 and 5 year survivals are 45% and 39%, respectively, due to the underlying cardiac disease and comorbidities in older patients.
