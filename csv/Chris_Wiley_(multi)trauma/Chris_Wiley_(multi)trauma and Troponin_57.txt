Data show that thalamocortical, basal ganglia, midbrain and hindbrain circuits play important roles in seizure generation, conduction and modulation. The session will provide a basic overview of these systems and circuits, both functionally and anatomically. The thalamus uses systems able to synchronize or desynchronize electrical activity in wide regions of cortex. These thalamocortical systems play a role in generation of absence seizures and propagation of secondarily generalized seizures. The basal ganglia have a close relationship with the cortex, and may ?gate? activity through a widespread corticostriate system, thus potentially both enhancing and suppressing seizure activity. Midbrain and hindbrain circuits have been shown to have profound effects on seizures. The session will discuss how an understanding of subcortical-cortical networks can lead to therapeutic advances, with use of electrical brain stimulation or targeted pharmacotherapy as examples.

AB  - Abstract Observations made in the last few years support the existence of pathways, in adult humans and rodents, that allow adult stem cells to be surprisingly flexible in their differentiation repertoires. Termed plasticity, this property allows adult stem cells, assumed, until now, to be committed to generating a fixed range of progeny, to switch, when they have been relocated, to make other specialized sets of cells appropriate to their new niche. Reprogramming of some adult stem cells can occur in vivo; the stem cells normally resident in bone marrow appear particularly flexible and are able to contribute usefully to multiple recipient organs. This process produces cells with specialized structural and metabolic adaptations commensurate with their new locations. In a few examples, the degree of support is sufficient to assist or even rescue recipient mice from genetic defects. Some studies provide evidence for the expansion of the reprogrammed cells locally, but in most it remains possible that cells arrive and redifferentiate, but are no longer stem cells. Nevertheless, the fact that appropriately differentiated cells are delivered deep within organs simply by injection of bone marrow cells should make us think differently about the way that organs regenerate and repair. Migratory pathways for stem cells in adult organisms may exist that could be exploited to effect repairs using an individual's own stem cells, perhaps after gene therapy. Logical extensions of this concept are that a transplanted organ would become affected by the genetic susceptibilities of the recipient, alleles that re-express themselves via marrow-derived stem cells, and that plasticity after bone marrow transplantation would also transfer different phenotypes, affecting important parameters such as susceptibility to long-term complications of diabetes, or the ability to metabolize drugs in the liver. This article reviews some of the evidence for stem cell plasticity in rodents and man. Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Cerebral air embolism is a known complication of open-heart surgery with devastating consequences. Neurologic injury after CPB can be divided into 2 types: Type I: Focal injury. Type II: Intellectual deterioration/neurocognitive impairment (up to 53% at the time of hospital discharge and 42% could be impaired for up to 5 years). Increasing evidence points to cerebral embolization as the principal culprit. Since the early days of modern cardiac surgery, surgeons have attempted to limits its damage by various means. One of the early techniques propounded was carbon dioxide insufflation of the pericardial cavity. Carbon dioxide, was uniquely positioned for this, being denser than air, more soluble than air, and easily managed perioperatively if the blood levels were to go up beyond physiological ranges. The technique gradually went into disuse, since there was no instrumentation, in the early days of CPB to measure and establish its impact on the actual outcomes. Secondly, the devices, through which CO2 was delivered, were not effective. There has been increasing enthusiasm for the technique but no consensus on the technical considerations or on the actual benefits of the practice. Our literature search showed that if practiced properly, carbon dioxide flooding does decrease the embolic counts significantly and that, by inference, could possibly improve the neurocognitive outcome. Since, there are no studies at this point in time, which show a direct beneficial correlation, we intend to do a prospective randomized controlled trial, to put things in proper perspective.

AB  - Introduction? Post-operative survival after surgery for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is influenced by factors such as stage of disease and co-morbidities. We sought to assess the performance of 2 models in predicting 1 year survival after resected NSCLC. Methods? The Colinet Simplified Co-Morbidity Score (SCS) (1) and a prognostic model by Birim (2) were retrospectively applied to a cohort of patients with surgically resected NSCLC. End-point was 1 year survival obtained from clinical follow-up and data-linkage with the Cancer Council of Victoria. Results? 216 patients were treated from Feb 1999 to Dec 2005. 52 patients were excluded due to missing data, leaving 164 patients for analysis. Mean patient age was 66.4?±?10.3. Pathological stage was 1 in 61%, 2 in19% and 3 in 17%. Observed 1 year survival was 78.7%. SCS was predictive of 1 year survival: mean SCS 9.24 for survivors and 11.03 for non-survivors (p?=?0.001 by t-test). Patient?s with low SCS (0-9) had a higher 1-year survival than those with high SCS (>9); 87.2% vs 69.2% (p?=?0.005 by chi-square test). SCS discriminated fairly for 1 year survival (area under ROC curve 0.66). The predicted survival using the Birim model (74.2%) was similar to the observed survival (p?=?0.43). The model predicted survival well in both low (predicted 83% vs observed 88%, p?=?0.51) and high (66 vs 70%, p?=?0.74) risk groups. Birim model discriminated well for 1 year survival (area under ROC curve 0.70). Conclusion? SCS and the Birim model can both be used to estimate 1-year survival. They may aid the clinician in deciding who should be considered for surgical resection.

AB  - Introduction? In Wellington Hospital, CABG is being performed by various techniques like OPCAB, On-pump cardioplegic arrest, fibrillatory arrest and On-pump beating heart. Aim? This study was undertaken to compare morbidity and mortality between On- pump CABG and OPCAB on basis of Euroscore. Material and Method? From January 2003 till December 2004, data were collected according to Australasian society of Cardiothoracic surgery data set. Euroscores were calculated and patients were divided into 3 groups. Results of OPCAB and On-pump CABG were compared on basis of Euroscore group. In this period we performed 350 On-pump CABG and 254 OPCAB. Results? OPCAB group had less number of grafts per patients. Even for triple vessel disease numbers of grafts were lower in OPCAB group. OPCAB group had more patients with total arterial revascularization. There were 10 deaths in On-pump group and 1 in OPCAB group. In the low and moderate risk group there was no significant difference in hospital stay, ventilation hours and ICU stay. However inotropic requirement and requirements of blood products were less in OPCAB group. There was no statistically significant difference between Incidence of new renal failure or arrhythmia in two groups. 2 patients in each group had blocked graft in immediate postop period and required revascularization. There were only 5 patients in the high-risk group in OPCAB making intergroup comparisons difficult. Conclusion? OPCAB does not offer any significant advantage in terms of mortality and morbidity over On-pump CABG. To evaluate the effects of number of grafts and total arterial revascularization, it needs a long-term follow-up.

AB  - Charles Hufnagel began the era of artificial heart valve implantation in 1952, before the existence of technology that allowed the heart to be arrested. Hufnagel implanted a Lucite tube and ball in the descending aorta with clamps that facilitated rapid insertion without arresting the heart. Although valves in the descending aorta were somewhat successful in the management of aortic insufficiency, only a device placed in the appropriate anatomical or orthotopic position could help patients with valvular stenosis. This presentation will review the development of mechanical heart, emphasizing changes in valve design resulting from our greater understanding of blood hemodynamics, the mechanical forces imposed on valve components, and the interaction of artificial materials with components of circulating blood. The evolution from polymer to metal and finally the dominance of pyrolitic carbon as the material of choice will be explored. Similarities and differences between the four bileaflet valves that have received FDA approval and the two valves with CE mark approval that have not yet received FDA approval will be discussed.

AB  - At the end of the 20th century several inventors had suggested methods for catheter based implantation of cardiac valves. In September of 2000 Professor Philipp Bonhoeffer made transcatheter valve delivery a reality with the implantation of a stent mounted biological valve in the pulmonary position. Dr. Alain Cribier followed in 2002 with the first successful transcatheter implantation of a valve into the more challenging aortic position. Cardiac surgeons and industry seemed to show little interest in percutaneous valve delivery until January of 2004 when Edwards Life Science invested over $125 million in acquiring PVT, the company building the valves implanted by Dr. Cribier and Medtronic revealed the company?s support for Dr. Bonhoeffer?s efforts. A number of challenges have been identified and significant progress has been made in addressing some of these challenges. This presentation will describe the challenges associated with pulmonic and aortic transcatheter valve delivery. The progress that has been made in overcoming these challenges as well as the efforts being made to overcome the remaining challenges will be discussed.

AB  - Not infrequently, a patient status has changed and the surgeon is not informed. This not only leads to frustration but potentially bad outcomes. Devising a protocol for when to call the surgeon is fraught with difficulties. Frequently they are so complicated that individuals were unable to remember them thus the protocols are not applied. High turnover of junior staff means that large protocol books are not read. The below three rules are designed to fulfil the role of protocols. They are compulsory flags for when the surgeon is to be called. They are not guides to management nor comments on adequacy of management. Their intent is to flag a change in status of the patient. The compulsory nature of the flags reduces the decision making and stress for the resident staff as to whether or not they should be calling the boss. The surgeon is to be called when 1 The patient is to receive blood or blood products 2 The inotropes dose is doubled from admission 3 A vasoconstrictor is started
