AB  - Cerebral air embolism is a known complication of open-heart surgery with devastating consequences. Neurologic injury after CPB can be divided into 2 types: Type I: Focal injury. Type II: Intellectual deterioration/neurocognitive impairment (up to 53% at the time of hospital discharge and 42% could be impaired for up to 5 years). Increasing evidence points to cerebral embolization as the principal culprit. Since the early days of modern cardiac surgery, surgeons have attempted to limits its damage by various means. One of the early techniques propounded was carbon dioxide insufflation of the pericardial cavity. Carbon dioxide, was uniquely positioned for this, being denser than air, more soluble than air, and easily managed perioperatively if the blood levels were to go up beyond physiological ranges. The technique gradually went into disuse, since there was no instrumentation, in the early days of CPB to measure and establish its impact on the actual outcomes. Secondly, the devices, through which CO2 was delivered, were not effective. There has been increasing enthusiasm for the technique but no consensus on the technical considerations or on the actual benefits of the practice. Our literature search showed that if practiced properly, carbon dioxide flooding does decrease the embolic counts significantly and that, by inference, could possibly improve the neurocognitive outcome. Since, there are no studies at this point in time, which show a direct beneficial correlation, we intend to do a prospective randomized controlled trial, to put things in proper perspective.

AB  - Introduction? Post-operative survival after surgery for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is influenced by factors such as stage of disease and co-morbidities. We sought to assess the performance of 2 models in predicting 1 year survival after resected NSCLC. Methods? The Colinet Simplified Co-Morbidity Score (SCS) (1) and a prognostic model by Birim (2) were retrospectively applied to a cohort of patients with surgically resected NSCLC. End-point was 1 year survival obtained from clinical follow-up and data-linkage with the Cancer Council of Victoria. Results? 216 patients were treated from Feb 1999 to Dec 2005. 52 patients were excluded due to missing data, leaving 164 patients for analysis. Mean patient age was 66.4?±?10.3. Pathological stage was 1 in 61%, 2 in19% and 3 in 17%. Observed 1 year survival was 78.7%. SCS was predictive of 1 year survival: mean SCS 9.24 for survivors and 11.03 for non-survivors (p?=?0.001 by t-test). Patient?s with low SCS (0-9) had a higher 1-year survival than those with high SCS (>9); 87.2% vs 69.2% (p?=?0.005 by chi-square test). SCS discriminated fairly for 1 year survival (area under ROC curve 0.66). The predicted survival using the Birim model (74.2%) was similar to the observed survival (p?=?0.43). The model predicted survival well in both low (predicted 83% vs observed 88%, p?=?0.51) and high (66 vs 70%, p?=?0.74) risk groups. Birim model discriminated well for 1 year survival (area under ROC curve 0.70). Conclusion? SCS and the Birim model can both be used to estimate 1-year survival. They may aid the clinician in deciding who should be considered for surgical resection.

AB  - Introduction? In Wellington Hospital, CABG is being performed by various techniques like OPCAB, On-pump cardioplegic arrest, fibrillatory arrest and On-pump beating heart. Aim? This study was undertaken to compare morbidity and mortality between On- pump CABG and OPCAB on basis of Euroscore. Material and Method? From January 2003 till December 2004, data were collected according to Australasian society of Cardiothoracic surgery data set. Euroscores were calculated and patients were divided into 3 groups. Results of OPCAB and On-pump CABG were compared on basis of Euroscore group. In this period we performed 350 On-pump CABG and 254 OPCAB. Results? OPCAB group had less number of grafts per patients. Even for triple vessel disease numbers of grafts were lower in OPCAB group. OPCAB group had more patients with total arterial revascularization. There were 10 deaths in On-pump group and 1 in OPCAB group. In the low and moderate risk group there was no significant difference in hospital stay, ventilation hours and ICU stay. However inotropic requirement and requirements of blood products were less in OPCAB group. There was no statistically significant difference between Incidence of new renal failure or arrhythmia in two groups. 2 patients in each group had blocked graft in immediate postop period and required revascularization. There were only 5 patients in the high-risk group in OPCAB making intergroup comparisons difficult. Conclusion? OPCAB does not offer any significant advantage in terms of mortality and morbidity over On-pump CABG. To evaluate the effects of number of grafts and total arterial revascularization, it needs a long-term follow-up.

AB  - Charles Hufnagel began the era of artificial heart valve implantation in 1952, before the existence of technology that allowed the heart to be arrested. Hufnagel implanted a Lucite tube and ball in the descending aorta with clamps that facilitated rapid insertion without arresting the heart. Although valves in the descending aorta were somewhat successful in the management of aortic insufficiency, only a device placed in the appropriate anatomical or orthotopic position could help patients with valvular stenosis. This presentation will review the development of mechanical heart, emphasizing changes in valve design resulting from our greater understanding of blood hemodynamics, the mechanical forces imposed on valve components, and the interaction of artificial materials with components of circulating blood. The evolution from polymer to metal and finally the dominance of pyrolitic carbon as the material of choice will be explored. Similarities and differences between the four bileaflet valves that have received FDA approval and the two valves with CE mark approval that have not yet received FDA approval will be discussed.

AB  - At the end of the 20th century several inventors had suggested methods for catheter based implantation of cardiac valves. In September of 2000 Professor Philipp Bonhoeffer made transcatheter valve delivery a reality with the implantation of a stent mounted biological valve in the pulmonary position. Dr. Alain Cribier followed in 2002 with the first successful transcatheter implantation of a valve into the more challenging aortic position. Cardiac surgeons and industry seemed to show little interest in percutaneous valve delivery until January of 2004 when Edwards Life Science invested over $125 million in acquiring PVT, the company building the valves implanted by Dr. Cribier and Medtronic revealed the company?s support for Dr. Bonhoeffer?s efforts. A number of challenges have been identified and significant progress has been made in addressing some of these challenges. This presentation will describe the challenges associated with pulmonic and aortic transcatheter valve delivery. The progress that has been made in overcoming these challenges as well as the efforts being made to overcome the remaining challenges will be discussed.

AB  - Not infrequently, a patient status has changed and the surgeon is not informed. This not only leads to frustration but potentially bad outcomes. Devising a protocol for when to call the surgeon is fraught with difficulties. Frequently they are so complicated that individuals were unable to remember them thus the protocols are not applied. High turnover of junior staff means that large protocol books are not read. The below three rules are designed to fulfil the role of protocols. They are compulsory flags for when the surgeon is to be called. They are not guides to management nor comments on adequacy of management. Their intent is to flag a change in status of the patient. The compulsory nature of the flags reduces the decision making and stress for the resident staff as to whether or not they should be calling the boss. The surgeon is to be called when 1 The patient is to receive blood or blood products 2 The inotropes dose is doubled from admission 3 A vasoconstrictor is started

AB  - Purpose? This systematic review aims to assess the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency ablation(RFA) for pulmonary malignancies. Methodology? Searches for relevant literature on RFA for lung tumours prior to Nov 2006 were performed in six electronic databases. Application of predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, quality assessment and data extraction were independently performed for all retrieved studies. Results were synthesized through tabulation and combined with a narrative review. Results? Sixteen relevant studies on lung RFA with more than 10 patients that reported rates of morbidity, mortality, complete tumour ablation, local recurrence or survival were identified for this review. All included studies were level 4 evidence case series with median follow-up periods ranging from 9?24 months. The overall post-procedural morbidity rates ranged from 15?76% and mortality rates ranged from 0?5%. The most common complications were pneumothoraces occurring at 9?61 % of procedures. The rates of complete tumour necrosis achieved by RFA ranged from 38?98% while the rates of local recurrence from previously ablated lesions ranged from 2?38%. The overall median progression free interval ranged from 13 to 26 months. The overall median survival from the time of lung RFA, ranged from 8.6?33 months, with 1, 2 and 3 year survival of 71?85%, 55?65% and 38?46%, respectively. Conclusion? The available evidence for radiofrequency ablation of primary and metastatic lung tumours is very limited. Surgical resection should remain the standard of care when feasible. Radiofrequency ablation, however, is safe and appears to have a promising role in the treatment of unresectable lung tumours.

AB  - CPAP was first used for over 70 years ago and confers benefit to patients through a number of different mechanisms: ?? Reduction in left ventricular afterload ?? Reduction in work of breathing ?? Improved work sharing of fatiguing muscle groups ?? Maintenance of lung volumes with improved ventilation perfusion matching and improvement in oxygen ?? Prevention of upper airway obstruction ?? Reduced stress and ?biological? injury In a study of prophylactic CPAP following major abdominal surgery, those randomised to CPAP had a lower intubation rate (1% vs 10%, Relative risk [RR], 0.099, 95% CI, 0.01?0.76, p?=?0.005) and had a lower occurrence rate of pneumonia (2% vs 10%, RR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04?0.88, p?=?0.02), infection (3% vs 10%, RR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.07?0.94, p?=?0.03), and sepsis (2% vs 9%, RR, 0.22, 95% CI, 0.04?0.99, p?=?0.03) than did patients treated with oxygen alone1. The benefit of CPAP, largely through a reduction in the need for intubation and ventilation, are now clearly established in acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. A recent meta-analysis showed CPAP reduces mortality (RR, 0.59, 95% CI 0.38?0.90, p?=?0.15) and the need for mechanical ventilation (RR, 0.44, CI, 0.29?0.66, p?=?0.0003)2. Summary?? The perioperative cardiac surgical patient will frequently have impaired left ventricular function, pulmonary oedema, or atelectasis, all of which may be improved with the application of CPAP. Hence CPAP is likely to confer significant benefits through reduction in intubation, ventilation associated pneumonia, and mortality in the immediate post operative period.

AB  - Purpose? To evaluate our surgical results for ischaemic Ventricular Septal Rupture and suggest practice guidelines. Methodology? A retrospective review of data from patient records from 1992 to 2006 for presentation, surgical approaches, recurrence and mortality and analyzed for future management guidelines. Results? We had 36 patients with a mean age of 70.44(+/? 6.34). 14 patients (38.9%) had an inferior/ posterior defect, 28 were in shock (22 on IABP). Severe LV and RV dysfunction were present in 18 and 20 patients respectively. Repair involved patches after infarctectomy (17) or infarct exclusion (18), using either continuous or interrupted suture. Concomitant CABG was performed in 15. 11 patients had residual shunts, 2 requiring device closure and one surgery. Prolonged ICU and hospital stay was the norm. Early mortality was 52.78% (inferior defects ? 85.71%, anterior defects ? 31.82%). On Univariate analysis Inferior VSD (OR 7.7; 95% CI 1.7, 33.3), Moderate to severe RV impairment (OR 5.0; 95% CI 0.92, 33.3), Pre op shock (OR 6.7; 95% CI 1.6, 33.3), Early presentation post MI and infarctectomy during repair (3.8; 95% CI 0.9, 15.4), predicted mortality. For subgroup of anterior VSD, only pre-op shock (OR11.1; 95% CI 1.0, 100) predicted a poor outcome. On multivariate analysis, Inferior defects and shock at presentation were the dominant predictors for early death. Repair without cardioplegia (OR5.2; 95% CI 0.48, 56.09) was the only risk factor for recurrence. Conclusions? Acute ischaemic VSD is a grim surgical disease with high mortality. Inferior defects should be offered surgery only in exceptional circumstances due to uniformly poor outcome.

AB  - Purpose? In the light of improvement in results of surgery for acute infective endocarditis(IE),we analysed our surgical outcomes and risk factors associated with mortality in patients operated for acute IE in the past decade. Methodology? A retrospective study of 85 consecutive patients (54 males, 31 females, Mean age 50.4?±?18.9 years) who underwent surgery for IE between January 1997 to December 2006 was performed. The preoperative profiles,intraoperative findings and the postoperative outcomes were analysed. Results? Native valve endocarditis (NVE) was present in 78/85 patients and prosthetic valve endocarditis(PVE) in 7/85 patients. The aortic, mitral, tricuspid and multiple valves were involved in 30, 28, 15 and 9 pateints respectively. Seven out of 12 intravenous drug abusers had tricuspid valve involvement.The commonest organism was Staphylococcus aureus. The indications for surgery were heart failure (75.2%), failure of medical management (15.2%), abcess (9.4%) and embolism (8.2%). 65 patients underwent valve replacements (55 prosthetic valves, 6 homografts and 2 Ross procedures). 20 patients underwent valve repairs/vegetectomies, of which 5 were mitral repairs. There were 16 in-hospital deaths (18.8% overall). The mortality was 16.6% in NVE compared to 42.8% in PVE (p?<?0.05). PVE, ventilation greater than 24 hours, acute renal failure and severe left ventricular dysfunction were associated with increased mortality (p?<?0.05). 4 patients required reoperation for recurrent endocarditis during 1 year follow-up. Conclusion? Operation for active IE carries acceptable mortality rate for this aggressive disease. Prolonged ventilation, renal failure and severe LV dysfunction are associated with increased risk of mortality.

AB  - Descending necrotizing mediastinitis is a form of mediastinitis caused by odontogenic infection or deep cervical infections, which spreads to the mediastinum via the cervical facial planes. Criteria adopted for the diagnosis of Descending Necrotizing mediastinitis are clinical manifestations of severe infection, demonstration of characteristic roentgenographic features, documentation of the necrotizing mediastinal infection and establishment of oropharyngeal or cervical infection with the development of the necrotizing mediastinal process. Most of the published reports in literature are single case report. The largest series published is of 17 patients over 15 years. Despite the increased use of CT scan as a diagnostic aid and the improvement in antibiotics, mortality in patients with descending necrotizing mediastinitis remains high, reported between 25?40% in the literature. We have treated two patients with descending necrotizing mediastinitis at our institution. The primary oropharyngeal infection was Ludwig?s angina in one and odontogenic abscess in other. Both patients underwent mediastinal drainage, one through midsternotomy and other through right thoracotomy in addition of cervical infection drainage. The outcome was favorable in both the patients. Delay of diagnosis and inappropriate drainage of the mediastinum are the main cause of mortality in this life threatening condition. The various surgical approaches have been reported for mediastinal drainage to treat Descending necrotizing mediastinitis. We report our experience of patients with Descending necrotizing mediastinitis and discuss the surgical management of this highly fatal condition.

AB  - Purpose? Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common complication of cardiothoracic surgery, occurring in more than 30% of patients undergoing CABG. Postoperative AF results in thromboembolic events, haemodynamic compromise and an increase in length and cost of hospitalisation. Any intervention that reduces the incidence of postoperative AF should result in fewer complications in addition to being of important economic benefit. Increased consumption of oily fish or Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (PUFA) supplements substantially lowers the risk of sudden cardiac death and myocardial infarction both in primary and secondary prevention trials, through a reduction in fatal arrhythmias. Omega-3 PUFAs may also play a role in the treatment of AF as shown by cell culture research, animal models and a recent prospective observation study in 5000 elderly adults. With respect to postoperative AF, a recent Italian randomized controlled study in 160 patients showed that Omega-3 PUFA administration during hospitalisation in patients undergoing CABG reduced the incidence of postoperative AF by 54% and led to a shorter hospital stay. Methodology? We have undertaken a randomized, placebo controlled, prospective trial of Omega-3 PUFAs in patients undergoing CABG to examine its effect on the incidence of AF within 30 days and variations in length of hospital stay. We have also developed a clinically relevant measurement of the concentrations of the PUFA arachidonic acid and the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in patients with and without atrial fibrillation. Results? We are presenting interim results of the first 80 patients enrolled in the trial.
