AB  - Lymphatics of the heart have not generated any broad or sustained interests among clinicians. Few publications on cardiac lymphatics are available, anatomy not routinely known and the true role of cardiac lymphatics remains doubtful. One important anatomical concept needing clarification is that of the lymphatic nature of conduction tissue. Sino-atrial node lymphatic collector is incorporated into Aortic Fat Pad and as such is the most frequently damaged lymphatic vessel during cardiac surgery. Thus, preservation of Aortic Fat Pad and its lymphatic collector should reduce the incidence of new atrial fibrillation in patients post cardiac surgery, an observation reported in the literature recently.

AB  - Purpose? Deep sternal wound infection is a rare but serious complication of cardiac surgery. Currently there is no consensus on the optimal management. Vacuum Assisted Closure (V.A.C.) has been increasingly used to facilitate wound healing. We aim to review the management of deep sternal wound infections using V.A.C. dressing at our hospital. Methodology? 31 consecutive deep sternal wound infections over a five year period were reviewed. V.A.C. dressing was used either as a stand alone therapy or as an intermediate therapy to late sternal reconstruction. Results? Deep sternal wound infections were diagnosed on average 13 days from initial surgery. 26 (84%) patients were treated with V.A.C. dressing. Of these, 17 (65%) had stand alone V.A.C. therapy and 9 were followed by sternal reconstruction. The average duration of V.A.C dressing in the two groups were 21 and 13 days respectively. 7 patients died, 6 in the stand alone V.A.C. group and 1 in the intermediate V.A.C. group. The length of hospital stay was similar in both groups (41 vs. 45 days). Median follow up was 17 months. No late relapse was found in the stand alone group. In the intermediate therapy group, 2 patients had chronic wound sinuses and one patient had a wound collection. Conclusion? V.A.C. dressing may be used both as a stand alone and as an intermediate therapy for deep sternal wound infection. Reconstructive surgery may be avoided in a significant proportion of patients. No late relapse has been associated with V.A.C. use.

AB  - Flying a commercial aircraft is sometimes referred to as being 95% sheer boredom and 5% sheer terror. The safety record of modern airliners is dramatic. In 2006 there was one fatal accident for every 2.6 million departures. To put this in perspective: there were 65 departures every 60 seconds during that year; and one fatal accident every 28 days. While progress continues to be made on both the technical and human issues involved with aircraft design and operation, recent accidents, such as Swissair 111, have shown how rapidly a situation can progress from uncertainly to alarm to critical. In the last 10 years the number of airlines in the world flying western-built jets has increased by 46% (674 to 990), the number of flights has increased by 49%, the number of fatal accidents (hull losses) has decreased by 36% and the number of ?near-misses? has increased by 85%. These statistics suggest that major gains have been made in the area of human factors training given that the aircraft designs achieved a very high level of reliability some time ago. Human factors training in aviation is now focused on the management of ?threats? and ?errors?. This presentation will review this training philosophy and consider parallels for the medical environment.

AB  - The Second Global Patient Challenge, ?Safe Surgery Saves Lives? initiative of the World Health Organisation (WHO) will promote standardised, evidence-based approaches to improving patient safety, in part through measures to reduce certain common errors. From harmless slips (using salt instead of sugar) to disastrous and costly failures (a wrong drug leading to the death of a patient, wrong co-ordinates in a navigational computer leading to the Erebus airline disaster, or the simultaneous use of empirical and metric systems of measurement in an international collaboration leading to the loss of a Mars probe), error shadows every human endeavour, in part because error is closely linked to creativity and success. Our team has developed realistic scenarios using a high-fidelity human-patient simulator, in which participants must cope with multiple demands at times of high stress and distraction. In this ?error environment? anaesthetists are likely to fail in various ways, which may be predicted from the fundamental theories of the genesis of human error, thus allowing us to better study these otherwise rare events. In the next phase of our research we plan to include surgeons as active subjects, and to focus on the functioning of the team rather than the individual. This will further elucidate the factors which contribute to positive and negative aspects of human performance and will inform intiatives (such as that of the WHO) to improve patient safety in the operating room.

AB  - Objective? We developed a technique for mitral valve surgery through an ultra small (5?cm) right lateral thoracotomy without aortic cross clamp. This study reports our combined ST. Thomas and Vanderbilt Heart Institutes five years experience with this technique. Methods? Six hundred and twenty five (316 M /309 F; aged 22?75 mean of 62 years) underwent ultra minimally invasive mitral valve surgery between August 2000 and June 2006. Through a 5 centimeter right lateral thoracotomy along the 4th intercostal space access to the pericardium and the left atrium was gained. Cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted through femoral cannulation. Under cold fibrillatory arrest (28°C) without aortic cross clamp, mitral valve repair (n?=?196) or replacement (n?=?380), in addition to mitral valve procedure we performed tricuspid valve repair (n?=?69), ASD/PFO closure (n?=?201) and Maze (n?=?156). Mean pre operative New York Heart Association function class was 2.2?±?0.9. Twenty eight patients had ejection fraction less than 20%. Results? Thirty-day mortality was 1.28% (n?=?8), Operating time, bypass time operating averaged 189?±?52, 113?±?35 minutes, respectively. Three patients had conversion to sternotomy. Fifteen patients (2.4%) underwent reexploration for bleeding. Average length of hospital stay from surgery to discharge was 6.85?±?3 days. Ten patients (1.6%) had neurological events. Renal failure required hemodialysis in 5 patients (0.81%). Long term follow-up results are awaited. Conclusions? This study demonstrate that this simplified technique of ultra minimally invasive mitral valve surgery is reproducible and provides the least invasive operative approach with low mortality and morbidity with good cosmetic results.

AB  - Descending necrotizing mediastinitis is a form of mediastinitis caused by odontogenic infection or deep cervical infections, which spreads to the mediastinum via the cervical facial planes. Criteria adopted for the diagnosis of Descending Necrotizing mediastinitis are clinical manifestations of severe infection, demonstration of characteristic roentgenographic features, documentation of the necrotizing mediastinal infection and establishment of oropharyngeal or cervical infection with the development of the necrotizing mediastinal process. Most of the published reports in literature are single case report. The largest series published is of 17 patients over 15 years. Despite the increased use of CT scan as a diagnostic aid and the improvement in antibiotics, mortality in patients with descending necrotizing mediastinitis remains high, reported between 25?40% in the literature. We have treated two patients with descending necrotizing mediastinitis at our institution. The primary oropharyngeal infection was Ludwig?s angina in one and odontogenic abscess in other. Both patients underwent mediastinal drainage, one through midsternotomy and other through right thoracotomy in addition of cervical infection drainage. The outcome was favorable in both the patients. Delay of diagnosis and inappropriate drainage of the mediastinum are the main cause of mortality in this life threatening condition. The various surgical approaches have been reported for mediastinal drainage to treat Descending necrotizing mediastinitis. We report our experience of patients with Descending necrotizing mediastinitis and discuss the surgical management of this highly fatal condition.

AB  - Purpose? Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common complication of cardiothoracic surgery, occurring in more than 30% of patients undergoing CABG. Postoperative AF results in thromboembolic events, haemodynamic compromise and an increase in length and cost of hospitalisation. Any intervention that reduces the incidence of postoperative AF should result in fewer complications in addition to being of important economic benefit. Increased consumption of oily fish or Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (PUFA) supplements substantially lowers the risk of sudden cardiac death and myocardial infarction both in primary and secondary prevention trials, through a reduction in fatal arrhythmias. Omega-3 PUFAs may also play a role in the treatment of AF as shown by cell culture research, animal models and a recent prospective observation study in 5000 elderly adults. With respect to postoperative AF, a recent Italian randomized controlled study in 160 patients showed that Omega-3 PUFA administration during hospitalisation in patients undergoing CABG reduced the incidence of postoperative AF by 54% and led to a shorter hospital stay. Methodology? We have undertaken a randomized, placebo controlled, prospective trial of Omega-3 PUFAs in patients undergoing CABG to examine its effect on the incidence of AF within 30 days and variations in length of hospital stay. We have also developed a clinically relevant measurement of the concentrations of the PUFA arachidonic acid and the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in patients with and without atrial fibrillation. Results? We are presenting interim results of the first 80 patients enrolled in the trial.

AB  - Intensive care medicine is at the intersection of medical, surgical and engineering sciences. While the lion?s share of attention in medical research focuses on magic bullets, these have largely failed to deliver in intensive care. Specifically, significant improvements have come from improving what might be regarded as the ?bread and butter? of clinical practice. Improvements the management of sedation, ventilation, glycaemic control, sepsis, shock and renal support have resulted in significant improvements in patient outcomes. Simple measures such as switching off sedation on morning rounds can reduce duration of mechanical ventilation and length of intensive care stay by 32 to 35%1. Reduction of tidal volumes in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from 12 to 6?ml per kilogram has reduced mortality from 39.8% to 31% in a landmark study of 861 patients2. This is consistent with findings from smaller clinical trials and animal data linking shear forces in the lung, produced by mechanical ventilation, with biological injury. A recent study of 1548 mainly cardiothoracic surgical patients found that intensive insulin therapy reduced intensive care mortality from 8.0% with conventional treatment to 4.6%, with the greatest reduction in death due to multiple-organ failure with a proven septic focus3. Bloodstream infections, acute renal failure, red-cell transfusions, and critical-illness polyneuropathy were also all reduced by over 40%. Early goal directed therapy reduced in-hospital mortality from 46.5% to 30.5% in a cohort of 263 patients admitted to an emergency department in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock4. Significant benefits resulted from early resuscitation of shocked patients using predefined protocols. Summary? Targeted protocolised therapies across a wide range of intensive care conditions have resulted in the greatest outcome benefits for critically ill patients.

AB  - Purpose? Proximal anastomotic devices have been developed to produce predictable results that eliminate surgical technique as a variable with respect to the anastomosis, improve graft patency and lower the incidence of stroke. One criticism of current devices is foreign material contact at the anastomosis which is thought to stimulate intimal hyperplasia and thrombosis. In co-operation with AllVascular Restorative Vascular Solutions, an anastomotic device for use in vein graft-aortic anastomosis, the Universal Anastomotic Stent (UAS), was developed to eliminate foreign body contact with blood. Methodology? The design concept for the UAS was based on the Venous Valve Transfer stent developed by AllVascular. This stent is designed to transfer a functional venous valve to a vein with valve incompetence as a treatment of venous valve insufficiency. The UAS prototype developed from this stent underwent pre-clinical testing in sheep for design review. Results? Animal trials established that an external nitinol expanding stent can be used to create an arterial anastomosis. Loading a vein graft onto the UAS proved difficult in the absence of a crimping tool. A design concept for a dedicated loading tool has been developed and an animal model for future testing was finalised. Conclusions? The UAS, compared to existing anastomotic devices, has the advantage of maintaining intima-intima contact at the anastomosis, which may reduce the inflammatory response. External stenting may limit compliance mismatch at the anastomosis and reduce intimal hyperplasia. Further animal testing is required to establish if this novel anastomotic device will be suitable for human use.

AB  - During its development in the past 4 decades the perioperative care of cardiac surgery patients has been the most protocolised in any branch of surgery. Initially this protocolisation was developed to allow the introduction to the clinical environment of applied physiology which had previously only been possible in the research laboratory. Invasive pressure monitoring, blood chemistry management, cardiac performance manipulation and coagulation control were all subject to rule based management which could be successfully implemented by staff with a wide range of knowledge and experience. Coronary Artery Surgery is now proported to be the commonest single procedure performed in North America and what was once considered ?Miraculous? is now routine. Active Physiological management which was once only the realm of specialised units is now taught to all medical students. The protocols used in the perioperative management of 21st century cardiac surgery patients although still based on sound physiological criteria are now directed towards resource optimisation. Low mortality is now a given and so techniques which decreasing ICU and hospital stay and maximise value for money while at the same time decreasing complication rates are the new focus.
