AB  - Summary Pediatric intensive care units are quintessentially multidisciplinary units that care for patients of other physicians and must integrate all stakeholders, including the families and child, into the care delivery process. This chapter will review the major functions of the pediatric intensive care unit, and then discuss major organ system dysfunction and common diseases in critically ill children. This includes the cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, hematological, renal, and gastroenterological systems. Infection, sepsis, and systemic inflammatory response syndromes will also be discussed.

AB  - Abstract Among various classes of biomaterials, the majority of non-centrosymmetric crystalline materials exhibit piezoelectric properties, i.e., the accumulation of charge in response to applied mechanical stress or deformation. Due to the growing interest in nanomaterials, piezoelectric nano-biomaterials have been widely investigated, leading to remarkable advancements throughout the last two decades. Piezoelectric properties, high surface energy, targeting properties, and intricate cell?material interactions render piezoelectric nanomaterials highly attractive for application in therapeutics as well as regenerative medicine. Herein, the major focus is to highlight the wide range of applications of piezoelectric nano-biomaterials in drug delivery, theranostics, and tissue regeneration. After a brief introduction to piezoelectricity, an overview is provided on the major classes of piezoelectric biomaterials as well as a description of the origin of biopiezoelectricity in different tissues and macromolecules. Subsequently, relevant properties and postfabrication strategies of nanostructured piezoelectric biomaterials are discussed aiming to maximize piezoresponse. Finally, recent studies on nano- piezoceramics and piezopolymers are presented, with specific focus on barium titanate, zinc oxide, and polyvinylidene fluoride.

AB  - Abstract The development of microfluidic methodology that can be used in conjunction with drug screening and biomolecular diagnostics offers a route to evidence-based personalized medical care. Ideally, all personal diagnostics are best carried out in a rapid and frequent manner and a microfluidic interface can provide appropriate methodology. The ability to perform genetic analysis or biomarker detection at point-of-care would allow the clinician to decide on the most informed course of treatment. Microfluidic systems for biomolecular analysis at all levels, from genes to whole tissue biopsies, have been proposed. Much of the work presented here is at an early stage of development but will consider the range of design considerations together with the plethora of potential applications of integrated microfluidic technology.

AB  - Objective The objective of this study was to obtain a nomogram of the clivus-suvraocciput angle as a basis for the diagnosis of Chiari II malformation in fetuses with ventriculomegaly. Design A cross-sectional study was undertaken on 310 normal pregnant women of 16?34?weeks' gestation. A mid-sagittal section of the fetal skull was obtained and the angle between the clivus and the supraocciput was measured. 44 fetuses with ventriculomegaly due to different causes (13 Chiari II malformation, 12 dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, 7 aqueductal stenosis, 6 borderline ventriculomegaly, 3 Dandy-Walker malformation, 2 porencephaly, 1 schizencephaly) were also included into the study and the values of the angle found in the pathological cases were compared with that found in the normal population. Results The clivus-supraocciput angle did not change during gestation and was almost constant with an average value of 79,3°?±?6°. All cases of Chiari II malformation showed a value below the 10th centile of our nomogram; all the remaining cases of ventriculomegaly showed normal values of the angle. Conclusions The evaluation of the posterior fossa and particularly the measurement of the clivus-supraocciput angle is a useful parameter to differentiate the various causes of fetal ventriculomegaly and particularly to recognize Chiari II malformation. The measurement of the angle could be also useful to screen for spina bifida which is almost constantely associated to Chiari II malformation.

AB  - Introduction The hypothesis was tested whether the improvement in the human fetal cardiac diastolic and systolic functions are associated with changes in the cardiac volume blood flow, inflow blood velocity waveform characteristics, systemic venous blood flow parameters, umbilical artery velocimetry and fetal nuchal translucency. By a longitudinal study protocol the inflow and outflow blood velocity waveforms were obtained in 16 uncomplicated pregnancies at 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10?weeks. Results The proportion of isovolumetric relaxation time decreased and the proportions of filling and ejection times of the cardiac cycle increased significantly from 6 to 7?weeks. The proportion of isovolumetric contraction decreased between 8 and 9?weeks. Every inflow waveform was monophasic before 9?weeks but it was biphasic in all cases at 10?weeks. Mean velocity of inflow and outflow increased between 6 and 7?weeks and Vmean of inflow increased further after 8?weeks. At 9 and 10?weeks, atrioventriculu valve recurgitation (AVVR) was present in 4 and 7 fetuses, respectively. Nuchal translucency was greater in fetuses with AVVR present at 10?weeks compared with non-AVVR cases. Conclusion Improvement in the diastolic function of fetal heart between 6 and 7?weeks is accompanied by simultaneous increase in the mean velocities across inflow and outflow tracts. Appearance of biphasic inflow pattern is associated with significant change in systolic function between 8 and 9?weeks. AVVR is a common finding at 10?weeks of gestation.

AB  - ?Classic? fetal echocardiography is based on 7 transverse planes: the upper abdomen, the traditional four-chamber view, the five-chamber view in which the aortic root is visualized, and the fourth transverse view revealing the bifurcation of the pulmonary arteries, and long-axis views of the outflow tracts and aortic arch. We recently proposed the three vessel and trachea (3VT) plane of insonation be added, to facilitate and expedite fetal heart evaluation. The (3VT) is the most cephalad transverse view, visualized on a plane crossing the fetal upper mediastinum. It is obtained easily by moving the transducer cephalad and slightly oblique from the FCV, and shows the main pulmonary trunk (MPA) in direct communication with the ductus arteriosus (DA). A transverse section of the aortic arch is seen to the right of the MPA and DA. Cross sections of the superior vena cava (SVC), and posterior to it the trachea, are visualized. The clinical applicability of the 3VT was demonstrated in a recent study encompassing 1263 low-and high-risk cases scanned between 14 and 24?weeks' gestation. We consider one of the greatest advantages of our novel approach the ease with which the examiner can scan the fetal heart, beginning with the caudal upper-abdomen view. By sliding the transducer cephalad in one continuous motion, all the pertinent views are readily visualized. It was also shown to be effective in the diagnosis of such aortic arch anomalies as right and double aortic arch, among others. We showed that five short axis views including the 3VT simplified and streamlined fetal cardiac examination, without compromising diagnostic effectiveness.

AB  - The basis of ultrasound diagnosis of adnexal masses is the gray scale ultrasound image. In our prospective study of 173 patients scheduled for laparotomy because of an adnexal mass, an experienced examiner correctly discriminated between benign and malignant masses in 95% of cases on the basis of subjective evaluation of the gray scale ultrasound image (sensitivity 92%, i.e. 22/24, specificity 96%, i.e. 143/149). A correct specific diagnosis (e.g. dermoid cyst, endometrioma, etc.) was made in 72 of the 173 women, i.e. in 42%. Adding Doppler ultrasound examination to gray scale imaging did not change the diagnostic accuracy, but it increased the confidence (as rated on a visual analogue scale) with which a correct diagnosis was made in 14% of cases. Increased diagnostic confidence was observed most often in stage I ovarian malignancies (83%, i.e. 5/6). Doppler ultrasound examination was not helpfull in the diagnosis of borderline tumors. For less experienced ultrasound examiners the use of mathematical models to calculate an individual risk of malignancy might be an alternative to subjective evaluation of the the gray scale ultrasound image. In a study of 136 consecutive women scheduled for laparotomy because of an adnexal mass, two mathematical formulas were cross-validated prospectively: that of Tailor et al. (Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology 1997; 10?:?41?7) and that of Timmermann et al. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999; 181: 157?65). Both models performed less well than in the studies where they were created, the sensitivity and specificity of the first model being 71% and 82%, respectively, and the sensitivity and specificity of the second model 72% and 68%, respectively. Conclusion Subjective evaluation of the gray scale ultrasound image is an excellent method for discrimination between benign and malignant adnexal masses. Mathematical models hold promise but must be fine tuned on the basis of information from a very large number of tumors.

AB  - Spectral Doppler velocimetry supported by directional color Doppler imaging became the method of choice for recording blood velocity signals from the maternal uterine arteries during the third trimester of gestation. Normally, the uterine artery waveforms show a high proportion of diastolic flow without any early diastolic notch and with a low resistance (RI) or pulsatility (PI) index. With increasing gestation, there is a slight decrease in the resistance to flow in the placental circulation. The placental side of the uterus shows lower values of the waveform indices than the nonplacental. In high-risk pregnancies, the abnormally high PI or the presence of notch is predictive of the adverse outcome of pregnancy. Recently, a Uterine Artery Score (UAS) has been presented based on a combined evaluation of RI and notch (Sekizuka et al., J Mat Fet Invest 1997; 7:?197). We have modified this approach, using PI and a uniform cut-off value for definition of the abnormal PI, disregarding the placenta location. The modified UAS in combination with the umbilical artery Blood Flow Classes possess a high predictive value with regard to the perinatal outcome in high-risk pregnancies, especially in those with placental hemodynamic dysfunction. In cases of intrauterine growth restriction, the combined examination of the uterine and umbilical circulation improves the clinical value of the third trimester Doppler velocimetry.

AB  - The aim of this study is to retrospectively evaluate the complications, safety and accuracy of midtrimester amniocentesis (MTAcz) in multiple pregnancy (MP). The indications and complications of MTAcz are the same for singleton pregnancies (SP) and MP, but what's different is the technique of the procedure and frequency of complications. Various techniques are here quoted, the purpose of which is to prove that samples have been taken from separate sacs. In general, the efficacy in amniotic fluid collection is 92?98%, and 95.6% in autors' cases. The number of insertion needles may have the influence on the abortion rate, but the opposite opinion also exists. The rate of spontaneous abortions has been analysed retrospectively in a group of SP with and without amniocentesis. The same parameters were also evaluated for MP. The risk of spontaneous abortions following MTAcz is nearly 2.5 times higher in MP (1.7% vs. 3.89%) than in SP, but is still within the range of normally elevated biological risk (4.5%) of this group of subjects.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to determine whether three-dimensional ultrasound (3-D US) can improve the diagnostic ability in a routine check-up of patients undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) in an office practice. Methods Three-dimensional and power Doppler ultrasound were performed on 267 patients undergoing IVF on the first visit, during ovulation induction and aspiration of the oocytes. Patients with suspected uterine anomalies and/or abnormalities of the endometrium (N?=?108) were treated by operative hysteroscopy. On the day of oocyte collection, multiplanar imaging and 3-D reconstruction demonstrated cumuli in follicles greater than 15?mm. Cumulus assessment inside the ovarian follicles was correlated to the number of mature oocytes. Power Doppler reconstruction was performed in the cases when superponing vessels did not allow correct placing of the puncture needle. Results Of 108 patients with suspected uterine abnormality, the diagnosis was correct in all cases of endometrial polyp, submucous myoma, arcuate uteri and septate uteri, as confirmed by an office hysteroscopy. Intrauterine synechiae was correctly diagnosed preoperatively in one out of the four cases. The mean (±?SD) number of follicles >?18?mm was 8.2?±?5.8, and total number of follicles demonstrating cumulus in all three planes was 6.4?±?5.1. The ratio cumuli/retrieved oocytes, cumuli/fertilised oocytes and cumuli/mature oocytes was 6.2?±?4.2, 5.4?±?2.8 and 5.9?±?2.6, respectively. Conclusions Three dimensional ultrasound can become a standard of routine check-up of infertility patients allowing improved recognition of the uterine anatomy, characterisation of the surface features, and precise depiction of the ovaries during stimulation cycles. It can enhance and facilitate the morphologic and functional evaluation of the anatomic structures of the inner reproductive organs, thus avoiding the need of invasive diagnostic procedures. Various puncturing procedures can be more precisely performed. The built-in application of live 3-D mode may be very helpful in performing invasive procedures, such as oocyte collection.
