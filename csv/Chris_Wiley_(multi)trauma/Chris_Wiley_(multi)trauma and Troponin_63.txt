AB  - ?Classic? fetal echocardiography is based on 7 transverse planes: the upper abdomen, the traditional four-chamber view, the five-chamber view in which the aortic root is visualized, and the fourth transverse view revealing the bifurcation of the pulmonary arteries, and long-axis views of the outflow tracts and aortic arch. We recently proposed the three vessel and trachea (3VT) plane of insonation be added, to facilitate and expedite fetal heart evaluation. The (3VT) is the most cephalad transverse view, visualized on a plane crossing the fetal upper mediastinum. It is obtained easily by moving the transducer cephalad and slightly oblique from the FCV, and shows the main pulmonary trunk (MPA) in direct communication with the ductus arteriosus (DA). A transverse section of the aortic arch is seen to the right of the MPA and DA. Cross sections of the superior vena cava (SVC), and posterior to it the trachea, are visualized. The clinical applicability of the 3VT was demonstrated in a recent study encompassing 1263 low-and high-risk cases scanned between 14 and 24?weeks' gestation. We consider one of the greatest advantages of our novel approach the ease with which the examiner can scan the fetal heart, beginning with the caudal upper-abdomen view. By sliding the transducer cephalad in one continuous motion, all the pertinent views are readily visualized. It was also shown to be effective in the diagnosis of such aortic arch anomalies as right and double aortic arch, among others. We showed that five short axis views including the 3VT simplified and streamlined fetal cardiac examination, without compromising diagnostic effectiveness.

AB  - The basis of ultrasound diagnosis of adnexal masses is the gray scale ultrasound image. In our prospective study of 173 patients scheduled for laparotomy because of an adnexal mass, an experienced examiner correctly discriminated between benign and malignant masses in 95% of cases on the basis of subjective evaluation of the gray scale ultrasound image (sensitivity 92%, i.e. 22/24, specificity 96%, i.e. 143/149). A correct specific diagnosis (e.g. dermoid cyst, endometrioma, etc.) was made in 72 of the 173 women, i.e. in 42%. Adding Doppler ultrasound examination to gray scale imaging did not change the diagnostic accuracy, but it increased the confidence (as rated on a visual analogue scale) with which a correct diagnosis was made in 14% of cases. Increased diagnostic confidence was observed most often in stage I ovarian malignancies (83%, i.e. 5/6). Doppler ultrasound examination was not helpfull in the diagnosis of borderline tumors. For less experienced ultrasound examiners the use of mathematical models to calculate an individual risk of malignancy might be an alternative to subjective evaluation of the the gray scale ultrasound image. In a study of 136 consecutive women scheduled for laparotomy because of an adnexal mass, two mathematical formulas were cross-validated prospectively: that of Tailor et al. (Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology 1997; 10?:?41?7) and that of Timmermann et al. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999; 181: 157?65). Both models performed less well than in the studies where they were created, the sensitivity and specificity of the first model being 71% and 82%, respectively, and the sensitivity and specificity of the second model 72% and 68%, respectively. Conclusion Subjective evaluation of the gray scale ultrasound image is an excellent method for discrimination between benign and malignant adnexal masses. Mathematical models hold promise but must be fine tuned on the basis of information from a very large number of tumors.

AB  - Spectral Doppler velocimetry supported by directional color Doppler imaging became the method of choice for recording blood velocity signals from the maternal uterine arteries during the third trimester of gestation. Normally, the uterine artery waveforms show a high proportion of diastolic flow without any early diastolic notch and with a low resistance (RI) or pulsatility (PI) index. With increasing gestation, there is a slight decrease in the resistance to flow in the placental circulation. The placental side of the uterus shows lower values of the waveform indices than the nonplacental. In high-risk pregnancies, the abnormally high PI or the presence of notch is predictive of the adverse outcome of pregnancy. Recently, a Uterine Artery Score (UAS) has been presented based on a combined evaluation of RI and notch (Sekizuka et al., J Mat Fet Invest 1997; 7:?197). We have modified this approach, using PI and a uniform cut-off value for definition of the abnormal PI, disregarding the placenta location. The modified UAS in combination with the umbilical artery Blood Flow Classes possess a high predictive value with regard to the perinatal outcome in high-risk pregnancies, especially in those with placental hemodynamic dysfunction. In cases of intrauterine growth restriction, the combined examination of the uterine and umbilical circulation improves the clinical value of the third trimester Doppler velocimetry.

AB  - The aim of this study is to retrospectively evaluate the complications, safety and accuracy of midtrimester amniocentesis (MTAcz) in multiple pregnancy (MP). The indications and complications of MTAcz are the same for singleton pregnancies (SP) and MP, but what's different is the technique of the procedure and frequency of complications. Various techniques are here quoted, the purpose of which is to prove that samples have been taken from separate sacs. In general, the efficacy in amniotic fluid collection is 92?98%, and 95.6% in autors' cases. The number of insertion needles may have the influence on the abortion rate, but the opposite opinion also exists. The rate of spontaneous abortions has been analysed retrospectively in a group of SP with and without amniocentesis. The same parameters were also evaluated for MP. The risk of spontaneous abortions following MTAcz is nearly 2.5 times higher in MP (1.7% vs. 3.89%) than in SP, but is still within the range of normally elevated biological risk (4.5%) of this group of subjects.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to determine whether three-dimensional ultrasound (3-D US) can improve the diagnostic ability in a routine check-up of patients undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) in an office practice. Methods Three-dimensional and power Doppler ultrasound were performed on 267 patients undergoing IVF on the first visit, during ovulation induction and aspiration of the oocytes. Patients with suspected uterine anomalies and/or abnormalities of the endometrium (N?=?108) were treated by operative hysteroscopy. On the day of oocyte collection, multiplanar imaging and 3-D reconstruction demonstrated cumuli in follicles greater than 15?mm. Cumulus assessment inside the ovarian follicles was correlated to the number of mature oocytes. Power Doppler reconstruction was performed in the cases when superponing vessels did not allow correct placing of the puncture needle. Results Of 108 patients with suspected uterine abnormality, the diagnosis was correct in all cases of endometrial polyp, submucous myoma, arcuate uteri and septate uteri, as confirmed by an office hysteroscopy. Intrauterine synechiae was correctly diagnosed preoperatively in one out of the four cases. The mean (±?SD) number of follicles >?18?mm was 8.2?±?5.8, and total number of follicles demonstrating cumulus in all three planes was 6.4?±?5.1. The ratio cumuli/retrieved oocytes, cumuli/fertilised oocytes and cumuli/mature oocytes was 6.2?±?4.2, 5.4?±?2.8 and 5.9?±?2.6, respectively. Conclusions Three dimensional ultrasound can become a standard of routine check-up of infertility patients allowing improved recognition of the uterine anatomy, characterisation of the surface features, and precise depiction of the ovaries during stimulation cycles. It can enhance and facilitate the morphologic and functional evaluation of the anatomic structures of the inner reproductive organs, thus avoiding the need of invasive diagnostic procedures. Various puncturing procedures can be more precisely performed. The built-in application of live 3-D mode may be very helpful in performing invasive procedures, such as oocyte collection.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study is to investigate processes of placentation by the use of three-dimensional sonography. Methods A group of 25 pregnant women in gestational age ranging six to 10 weeks underwent a detailed assessment. The ultrasound device was Voluson 530D MT, by Kretztechnik, Zipf, Austria. Measurements in three-dimensional B-mode were gestational sac volume, chorion volume, and embryonic volume. Volumes were measured by the use of an integrated software. Structures were outlined manually in multiple parallel sections. The machine integrated and calculated the volume. The hemodynamical changes correlated to the process of placentation were assessed by the use of three-dimensional power Doppler (angio mode). Three-dimensional imaging of vascular changes was expressed and quantified by the use of volume flow index (VFI). The analysis of the results included correlation of morphological and hemodynamical parameters obtained by measurements. Results The volume of gestational sac, chorion and embryo increases during the weeks of gestation under investigation. The amount of vascular spaces in the chorion and surrounding myometrium increase with gestational age and correlates with the gestational sac and chorion volume. Conclusion 3D power Doppler sonography is a valuable tool for assessment and quantification of hemodynamic changes involved in placentation.

AB  - Development during the past 5?years increased significantly the quality of ultrasound mammography. After trying to receive better image quality by using higher and higher frequencies up to 20 Mhz the todays breakthrough was reached by better scan converter and transducer technology. Broadband tranducers, harmonic imaging, Siescape, Angio-powerdoppler, SonoCT, 3-D imaging and the use of contrast agent improved not only image but diagnostic quality of the method. The better scin, nipple, ductal an microcalcification visualization in combination with better mass delineation allowed a diagnostic accuracy equally or better than X-ray mammography. Ultrasound mammography is the logical examination following breast palpation, can complement mammography in all patients, substitute too frequent mammography controls and save unnecessary MRIs. Unfortunately the method suffers from lack of qualified education & training, qualified users and qualified payment. Gynecologists, radiologists and surgeons should struggle together to establish the method in a appropriate way ? in the interest of all women.

AB  - In the last 20?years there have been numerous improvements in IVF techniques leading to an exponetial increase in pregnancy rates. In spite of these improvements the patients undergoing IVF procedure still have more chance of failure than success. This presentation will address the areas in IVF treatment in which the use of color Doppler ultrasound could improve the results of IVF. Discussion will include the appropriate assessment of ovarian reserve as well as why the determination of the initial dose of gonadotropins based solely upon the patient's chronological age or serum FSH or E2 concentrations is imprecise. Recently, baseline ultrasound scans to assess for the presence of polycystic ovaries, and the use of color Doppler sonography to assess stromal perfusion have emerged as valuable tools in the assessment of the optimal dose selection of gonadotropins required for IVF ovarian stimulation. The issue of the assessment of oocyte maturity will additionally be discussed. Traditionally, follicular size has been used to assess oocyte maturity. However, frequently very poor oocytes are obtained from optimally grown follicles. It has been suggested that the assessment of peri-follicular flow could potentially distinguish oocyte maturity in a superior manner than size of follicles. Finally, the value of measurement of endometrial thickness and its structure, as well as uterine and subendometrial flow in the assessment of endometrial receptivity will be discussed.

AB  - Ultrasound characterization of ovarian morphology and vascularisation has become an important part of gynaecological endocrinology. PCO syndrome is the most prevalent endocrinological problem in women during reproductive period of life. The us diagnostic accuracy has advanced from recognition of ovarian size (volume), characteristic follicular distribution and volume of dense ovarian stroma, to blood flow changes in the uterine and ovarian stromal vessels. Improvement has been made by using innovations such as 3D US, colour and pulsed Doppler US, which allows US quantitative analysis of the ovarian stroma. In the PCOS the ovarian stroma is the source of hyperandrogenemia. One hundred and thirty-two patients with PCOS, diagnosed by us and endocrinological findings, underwent further clinical, US and endocrine evolution during various kinds of therapy (metformine, ovarian drilling, oral contraception, flutamide and finasteride treatment). Mean age of the PCO patients was 25.5?years (range 15?48), 59.3% were obese (BMI?=?28), 75.6% had signs of hirsutism, 43.02% presented with acne and 88.5% have had irregular menstrual cycle. Ultrasound findings (TVUS, colour and pulsed Doppler, 3D US) and hormonal evaluation (FSH, LH Androstendion, DHEA-a, T, Free T, SHBG, 3 α diol) were performed prior, during and at the end of the therapy. Comparison has been made between these five groups of patients.

AB  - Background All endometrial sampling methods are invasive. Therefore in sympyomatic women and for women at risk of developing endometrial pathology in menopause a technique that could reduce the number of biopsy procedures would be of a great value. This technique would be relatively non-invasive, easy to learn and perform, cost effective and well accepted by the patients. The objective of this study was the assessment of the diagnostic potency of ultrasound measurements by comparison with the usual histological investigation. Method Endovaginal ultrasonography (measurement of endometrial thickness and morphology of endometrium) prior to endometrial sampling was done in 160 postmenopausal patients. 143 D&C, 15 hysteroscopies and 2 laparotomies were performed to collect endometrial tissue. Indications for endometrial sampling were bleeding in 72%, ultrasound suspicion of endometrium in 18%, or other (cervical or adnexal pathology) in 10% of patients. Sonohysterography, as an improvement over conventional ultrasound methods, was done in 12 cases (7.5%). Pathologic findings were compared to preoperative ultrasonography. Results Ultrasound measurement of endometrial thickness combined with morphology and sonohysterography detected more than 90% endometrial pathology (sensitivity 96%, specificity 92%). Conclusion We found endovaginal ultrasound as useful tool at identifying endometrial diseases in menopause. For a postmenopausal woman with vaginal bleeding with a 10% pretest probability of endometrial cancer, her probability of cancer is less than 1% following a normal endovaginal sonography and sonohysterography. Ultrasound should be considered as investigational and cannot be used as the only methods to evaluate abnormal bleeding in menopausal patients.

AB  - Menopause is associated with an increase in the incidence of ischemic heart disease and stroke. Loss of ovarian function is characterized by significantly high values of blood and plasma viscosity. After the menopause, thromboxane production increases and correlates with duration of menopause. Large studies have shown that postmenopausal HRT is associated with reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease. The aim of the study was to evaluate the plasma thromboxane and plasma viscosity in relation with Doppler flow parameters in postmenopausal patients treated with HRT. Thirty-two postmenopausal (FSH?>?40 UI/L and estradiol <?100?pmol/L) women (mean age?±?SD, 54.7?±?2.9?years) participated in the study and were submitted to continuous estradiol transdermal supplementation and 12-day courses of medroxyprogesterone acetate every second month. Doppler resistances at the level of uterine and internal carotid arteries, thromboxane plasma levels and plasma viscosity were analyzed in basal condition and after 1, 3 and 6?months. During hormone supplementation, the pulsatility index significantly decreased at the level of analyzed arteries. Similarly, plasma thromboxane levels and plasma viscosity were significantly reduced. Significant correlations were found between thromboxane plasma concentrations, plasma viscosity and uterine artery resistances. Thus HRT seems to be responsible for both direct and indirect modifications at the level of the vessel wall physiology.

AB  - Background To investigate the effects of combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the vascular impedance of the uterine, inferior vesicle and ophtalmic artery. Method Thirty-five postmenopausal patients were analysed in basal condition and during a HRT phase at 1, 3 and 6?months. Patients were divided in two groups: 21 patients whose last menstrual bleeding was 1?5?years ago, and 14 patients with the duration of menopause >?6?years. Color Doppler analysis of the blood flow impedance was performed at the level of the uterine, inferior vesicle and ophtalmic artery. Estradiol plasma concentrations were assayed on the day of Doppler examinations. Results The analysis of the uterine and inferior vesicle artery flow velocities demonstrated significant positive correlations between resistance index (RI) and years of menopause; higher impedance values were obtained in patients with longer interval from last menstrual bleeding (P?<?0.05). The impedance in patients with >?6?years duration of menopause was 0.94?±?0.03 vs., 0.89?±?0.04, in the group of patients with 1?5?years duration of menopause for uterine artery, and for inferior vesicle artery (0.91?±?0.04 vs. 0.98?±?0.02). No significant correlation between baseline RI and time since menopause was noticed (0.72 vs. 0.73, respectively, P?>?0.05) at the level of ophtalmic artery. After six months of HRT plasma estradiol levels inversely correlated with RI uterine (r?=??0.2556; P?=?0.021), inferior vesicle (R?=??0.2653; P?=?0.023) and opthalmic (r?=??0.2211; P?=?0.017) arteries. Conclusion Doppler studies of uterine, inferior vesicle, and ophtalmic artery can provide specific and precise pathophysiological information to assess blood flow variations in correlation with combined HRT administration.

AB  - Background This study was conducted to assess uterine blood flow characteristics in endometrial cancer and to evaluate the influence of myometrial invasion and cancer grading for uterine circulation. Method Transvaginal color doppler was performed on 97 women with endometrial cancer (11 in stage IA, 33 in stage IB, 37 in stage IC, 7 in stage II, 8 in stage III, and 1 in stage IV) and 51 asymptomatic postmenopausal women (control group). Intratumoral and main uterine artery blood flow was recorded and the peak systolic velocity (PSV) and impedance indices (RI, PI) were calculated. Results In 90 of the 97 postmenopausal endometrial cancer patients (92%) abnormal blood flow with low impedance levels (RI: 0.39?±?0.08; PI: 0.51?±?0.15) was found within the endometrial echo or very close to it. Impedance indices in the main uterine arteries were significantly (P?<?0005) lower in women with endometrial cancer than in normal postmenopausal woman. Uterine blood flow was not modified by the cancer grading. There was, no difference in impedance indices of the uterine arteries between myometrial invasion of <?50% and >?50%. Conclusion These results suggest that uterine blood flow analysis in endometrial cancer could not predict the tumor staging and grading, but this examination can provide additional discriminatory information on tumor vascularity which can then be used with morphology for more accurate diagnosis.

AB  - Recently suggested role of tamoxifen as a preventive agent in women at high risk of breast cancer has a potential to increase significantly the number of women treated with tamoxifen agent. By the fact that tamoxifen is beneficial in taming the breast cancer, but detrimental to the uterus by increasing the risk of endometrial carcinoma, hyperplasia, and development of endometrial polyps, surveillance of endometrial changes in patients on tamoxifen is needed. However, no cost-effective method has been found for screening for the rare occurrence of endometrial carcinoma. Therefore, the ACOG does not recommend routine endometrial screening of tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients. Regardless of aforementioned recommendation, ultrasound (US) is very helpful as a first line for diagnosis of endometrial pathology in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with previous endometrial pathology. Endometrial thickness <?5?mm is reassuring,?>?5?8?mm calls for further investigation such as sonohysterography to rule out polyps.

AB  - The objective of this work was to assess the feasibility of real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (which acquires data as a volume, instead of a series of planes, eliminating gating) to evaluate fetal cardiac anatomy and function. We evaluated 10 human fetuses including several with congenital heart disease. Transabdominal scanning was performed using a real-time three-dimensional echocardiography system. Four 1.5 second volume clips at 20 volumes/second were obtained for each fetal heart and stored for off-line analysis. Data were reviewed on a graphics workstation. Our results showed that fetal heart data could be acquired rapidly. Fetal heart data were displayed as 3 simultaneous planes. The reviewer could manipulate plane orientation and position in the volume to optimize views. Cardiac motion could be accelerated, slowed, stopped or viewed at its original speed. Although image quality did not equal high-end equipment, cardiac structures, views and function could be consistently visualized. Abnormal structures were readily detected. In conclusion, real-time three-dimensional fetal echocardiography is a feasible and potentially important new technique that will gain importance as equipment performance improves.

AB  - Background The purpose of this study was to test the value of sonographic staging of twin?twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) in predicting the outcome of patients treated with amniocentesis or selective laser photocoagulation of communicating vessels (SLPCV). Methods TTTS was defined as a deep vertical pocket (DVP) in the recipient twin of >?8?cm and in the donor twin <?2?cm. TTTS was staged as follows: Stage I: bladder of donor visible; Stage II: bladder of donor not visible; Stage III: critically abnormal Dopplers; Stage IV: hydrops; Stage V: demise. Patients were treated with amniocentesis or SLPCV. Results There were a statistically significant difference by stage for at least one survivor between the two techniques (Chi-square = 2.63, p?=?0.05), but analysis was limited by sample size (amniocentesis n?=?9, SLPCV n?=?70). In the amniocentesis group there was an 83% (n?=?5) survival rate for two survivors in Stage I and no survivors (n?=?3) in stages II or III. In the SLPCV group, at least one fetus survived 83% of the time, regardless of stage. Conclusion Our preliminary data suggests that analysis of survival data by in TTTS needs stratification by stage. Early stages may be amenable to treatment with amniocentesis, while later stages may not benefit. SLPCV is uniformly effective, regardless of stage, but may not be warranted in early stages of TTTS.

AB  - In the growing embryo, the brain is the first organ system to develop in such a way that it can be imaged in detail with transvaginal ultrasound. The extension of the transvaginal ultrasound technique to 3D imaging makes it possible to obtain new ultrasound images of the developing embryonic brain in planes not available in the original scan plane, to present form and shape, and to calculate volume. New information about the embryonic brain development can be obtained: volume measurements of the embryonic brain compartments reflect the phylogenetic development. The ?old? rhombencephalon is large during the early phase, while the ?young? hemispheres are very small. During a few weeks, this correlation becomes reversed. Using 3D animations this dynamic developmental process can be visualized. Ultrasound technology has reached a level where the diagnosis of embryonic malformations can be made. At present, we are at the borderline of being able to diagnose holoprosencephaly when the embryo is seven to eight weeks. At nine weeks, 3D images of anomalies such as holoprosencephaly and spina bifida have been made. We may expect the rapidly developing 3D technology, with the option of anyplane slicing, to help us establish early diagnoses in the future. Such multiplane presentations of a diagnosis will contribute to increasing the diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the accuracy of ultrasound in identifying fetal brain space occupying lesions. Study design A retrospective evaluation of 14 cases of fetal brain space occupying lesions has been performed. All prenatal ultrasonographic diagnoses (5 teratomas, 1 choroid plexus papilloma and 8 arachnoid cysts) were compared with the postnatal findings on the aborted fetuses or on the newborns. Results In 11 out of 14 cases the antenatal ultrasonographic diagnosis was confirmed postnatally; 1 case of supratentorial arachnoid cyst was mistaken for a teratoma and 2 cases of porencephalic cysts were wrongly diagnosed as arachnoid cysts (specificity = 78.5%). The specificity was better in the subgroup of solid or complex masses (5 out of 6?=?83.3%) than in the subgroup of cystic lesions (6 out of 8?=?75%). Conclusions Prenatal ultrasonography is a useful tool to identify any intracranial space-occupying lesion. In the present study it has shown a 78.5% specificity in the diagnosis of brain masses, with better results in the solid than in the cystic lesions. The distinction between the different causes of fetal brain space occupying lesions is clinically relevant, as each one carries different prognostic implications.

AB  - The differential diagnosis of adnexal masses still represents a challenge. The main goal is to determine whether a given mass is malignant or benign, in order to establish the best therapautical approach. When a clinician face to a woman diagnosed as having an adnexal tumor several parameters may be used to determine the nature of the mass, such as patient's age, menopausal status, clinical complaints, physical examination, tumor's sonographic and Doppler features and serum tumor markers. When these data are collected may be difficult to interpret them all together and the clinician has to rely in one or two of them to predict the diagnosis and to decide the management strategy, guided many times by own experience or strict protocols. A possible solution to this question may be the use of computer modelling. This means the use of statistical or mathematical models developed, using computer aid, to predict adnexal malignancy. Currently, there are two methods that may be used: Multiple Logistic Regression Analysis (MLRA) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Both techniques allow to calculate the probability of a particular event has occurred, in this case a mass to be malignant or benign. By computer modelling, actual independent predictors parameters are identified and may be used combined and simultaneously to predict malignancy. Each method has advantages and disadvantages, being MLRA the statistical technique of choice and ANN a potential newer alternative to MLRA. Several studies have been published using one or both technique to predict adnexal malignancy. The results of these studies are encouraging showing a high diagnostic performance. All studies comparing MLRA to ANN showed the latter seems to be superior. However, it should be taken into account that most of these models have not tested prospectively.

AB  - The breast cancer metastases can be analyzed by ultrasound in ganglial and visceral organs. The detection of metastatic lymphonod in the axillar, cervical or supraclavicular regions and intrammamarian changes both the cancer staging and therapeutic planning. Benign lymphonode usually have an oval shape, hilum hyperechogenicity, narrow cortex and show hilar vascularization or radical central symmetric vascularization and absence of peripheral flow at Color Doppler. Malignant lymphonode are usually rounded hyporechoic, without hilar hyperechogenicity, and, in color Doppler, present multifocal aberrant vascularization, tortuous vessels or flow in the periphery. The most frequent visceral metastases of breast cancer are hepatic, the suprarenal glands and ovaries. About 86% of breast cancer hepatic metastases are hypoechoic. Ovarian cancer metastases can be detected mainly in pelvic tumors, peritonium tumors, glanglial, abdominal wall, hepatic and splenic metastases and ascites. Our study of 10 cases of splenic metastases of ovarian cancer has demonstrated six hyperechoic tumors, two hypoechoic and two tumors with necrosis. The use of color Doppler and Powerangio has demonstrated weak or moderate vascularization in glanglial and visceral metastases of gynecological tumors. The use of contrast (Levovist) has shown a more detailed vascular analysis by detecting vessels that were not identified in color Doppler and Powerangio without contrast.
