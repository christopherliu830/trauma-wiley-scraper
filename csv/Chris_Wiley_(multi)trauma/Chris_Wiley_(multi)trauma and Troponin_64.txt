AB  - The basis of ultrasound diagnosis of adnexal masses is the gray scale ultrasound image. In our prospective study of 173 patients scheduled for laparotomy because of an adnexal mass, an experienced examiner correctly discriminated between benign and malignant masses in 95% of cases on the basis of subjective evaluation of the gray scale ultrasound image (sensitivity 92%, i.e. 22/24, specificity 96%, i.e. 143/149). A correct specific diagnosis (e.g. dermoid cyst, endometrioma, etc.) was made in 72 of the 173 women, i.e. in 42%. Adding Doppler ultrasound examination to gray scale imaging did not change the diagnostic accuracy, but it increased the confidence (as rated on a visual analogue scale) with which a correct diagnosis was made in 14% of cases. Increased diagnostic confidence was observed most often in stage I ovarian malignancies (83%, i.e. 5/6). Doppler ultrasound examination was not helpfull in the diagnosis of borderline tumors. For less experienced ultrasound examiners the use of mathematical models to calculate an individual risk of malignancy might be an alternative to subjective evaluation of the the gray scale ultrasound image. In a study of 136 consecutive women scheduled for laparotomy because of an adnexal mass, two mathematical formulas were cross-validated prospectively: that of Tailor et al. (Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology 1997; 10?:?41?7) and that of Timmermann et al. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999; 181: 157?65). Both models performed less well than in the studies where they were created, the sensitivity and specificity of the first model being 71% and 82%, respectively, and the sensitivity and specificity of the second model 72% and 68%, respectively. Conclusion Subjective evaluation of the gray scale ultrasound image is an excellent method for discrimination between benign and malignant adnexal masses. Mathematical models hold promise but must be fine tuned on the basis of information from a very large number of tumors.

AB  - Spectral Doppler velocimetry supported by directional color Doppler imaging became the method of choice for recording blood velocity signals from the maternal uterine arteries during the third trimester of gestation. Normally, the uterine artery waveforms show a high proportion of diastolic flow without any early diastolic notch and with a low resistance (RI) or pulsatility (PI) index. With increasing gestation, there is a slight decrease in the resistance to flow in the placental circulation. The placental side of the uterus shows lower values of the waveform indices than the nonplacental. In high-risk pregnancies, the abnormally high PI or the presence of notch is predictive of the adverse outcome of pregnancy. Recently, a Uterine Artery Score (UAS) has been presented based on a combined evaluation of RI and notch (Sekizuka et al., J Mat Fet Invest 1997; 7:?197). We have modified this approach, using PI and a uniform cut-off value for definition of the abnormal PI, disregarding the placenta location. The modified UAS in combination with the umbilical artery Blood Flow Classes possess a high predictive value with regard to the perinatal outcome in high-risk pregnancies, especially in those with placental hemodynamic dysfunction. In cases of intrauterine growth restriction, the combined examination of the uterine and umbilical circulation improves the clinical value of the third trimester Doppler velocimetry.

AB  - The aim of this study is to retrospectively evaluate the complications, safety and accuracy of midtrimester amniocentesis (MTAcz) in multiple pregnancy (MP). The indications and complications of MTAcz are the same for singleton pregnancies (SP) and MP, but what's different is the technique of the procedure and frequency of complications. Various techniques are here quoted, the purpose of which is to prove that samples have been taken from separate sacs. In general, the efficacy in amniotic fluid collection is 92?98%, and 95.6% in autors' cases. The number of insertion needles may have the influence on the abortion rate, but the opposite opinion also exists. The rate of spontaneous abortions has been analysed retrospectively in a group of SP with and without amniocentesis. The same parameters were also evaluated for MP. The risk of spontaneous abortions following MTAcz is nearly 2.5 times higher in MP (1.7% vs. 3.89%) than in SP, but is still within the range of normally elevated biological risk (4.5%) of this group of subjects.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to determine whether three-dimensional ultrasound (3-D US) can improve the diagnostic ability in a routine check-up of patients undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) in an office practice. Methods Three-dimensional and power Doppler ultrasound were performed on 267 patients undergoing IVF on the first visit, during ovulation induction and aspiration of the oocytes. Patients with suspected uterine anomalies and/or abnormalities of the endometrium (N?=?108) were treated by operative hysteroscopy. On the day of oocyte collection, multiplanar imaging and 3-D reconstruction demonstrated cumuli in follicles greater than 15?mm. Cumulus assessment inside the ovarian follicles was correlated to the number of mature oocytes. Power Doppler reconstruction was performed in the cases when superponing vessels did not allow correct placing of the puncture needle. Results Of 108 patients with suspected uterine abnormality, the diagnosis was correct in all cases of endometrial polyp, submucous myoma, arcuate uteri and septate uteri, as confirmed by an office hysteroscopy. Intrauterine synechiae was correctly diagnosed preoperatively in one out of the four cases. The mean (±?SD) number of follicles >?18?mm was 8.2?±?5.8, and total number of follicles demonstrating cumulus in all three planes was 6.4?±?5.1. The ratio cumuli/retrieved oocytes, cumuli/fertilised oocytes and cumuli/mature oocytes was 6.2?±?4.2, 5.4?±?2.8 and 5.9?±?2.6, respectively. Conclusions Three dimensional ultrasound can become a standard of routine check-up of infertility patients allowing improved recognition of the uterine anatomy, characterisation of the surface features, and precise depiction of the ovaries during stimulation cycles. It can enhance and facilitate the morphologic and functional evaluation of the anatomic structures of the inner reproductive organs, thus avoiding the need of invasive diagnostic procedures. Various puncturing procedures can be more precisely performed. The built-in application of live 3-D mode may be very helpful in performing invasive procedures, such as oocyte collection.

AB  - Abstract The development of microfluidic methodology that can be used in conjunction with drug screening and biomolecular diagnostics offers a route to evidence-based personalized medical care. Ideally, all personal diagnostics are best carried out in a rapid and frequent manner and a microfluidic interface can provide appropriate methodology. The ability to perform genetic analysis or biomarker detection at point-of-care would allow the clinician to decide on the most informed course of treatment. Microfluidic systems for biomolecular analysis at all levels, from genes to whole tissue biopsies, have been proposed. Much of the work presented here is at an early stage of development but will consider the range of design considerations together with the plethora of potential applications of integrated microfluidic technology.

AB  - ABSTRACT Ischemic disorders, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease, are the most common causes of debilitating disease and death in westernized cultures. The extent of tissue injury relates directly to the extent of blood flow reduction and to the length of the ischemic period, which influence the levels to which cellular ATP and intracellular pH are reduced. By impairing ATPase-dependent ion transport, ischemia causes intracellular and mitochondrial calcium levels to increase (calcium overload). Cell volume regulatory mechanisms are also disrupted by the lack of ATP, which can induce lysis of organelle and plasma membranes. Reperfusion, although required to salvage oxygen-starved tissues, produces paradoxical tissue responses that fuel the production of reactive oxygen species (oxygen paradox), sequestration of proinflammatory immunocytes in ischemic tissues, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and development of postischemic capillary no-reflow, which amplify tissue injury. These pathologic events culminate in opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores as a common end-effector of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced cell lysis and death. Emerging concepts include the influence of the intestinal microbiome, fetal programming, epigenetic changes, and microparticles in the pathogenesis of I/R. The overall goal of this review is to describe these and other mechanisms that contribute to I/R injury. Because so many different deleterious events participate in I/R, it is clear that therapeutic approaches will be effective only when multiple pathologic processes are targeted. In addition, the translational significance of I/R research will be enhanced by much wider use of animal models that incorporate the complicating effects of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. ? 2017 American Physiological Society.

AB  - Diagnostic ultrasound in the early pregnancy deals with the recognition of normal anatomy and/or the detection of anomalies in very early viable pregnancies. There are clinical situations where the position of the embryo does not allow imaging of the optimal section of a certain organ. This is often the case with the transvaginal approach, where movements of the transducer are limited. Deriving new 2D images by anyplane slicing is an important presentation mode of embryonic 3D ultrasound. Geometric 3D reconstructions can also be helpful for the understanding of the embryonic anatomy. High quality 2D tomograms are the prerequisite of 3D imaging of the tiny embryo and its organs. Such ultrasound tomograms can be achieved by using annular array transducers, which have a thin elevation plane due to symmetric focussing. Examples of multiplane imaging and geometric volume reconstructions in the assessment of the embryonic anatomy will be presented, and the limitations will be discussed.

AB  - Intrauterine allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been successfully used for the prenatal treatment of severe combined immunodefiency syndrome. However, this treatment has not been successful in other conditions in which the fetus is immunologically competent. The main obstacles to success are lack of competitive advantage of donor vs. host stem cells preventing stable engraftment and graft rejection by the host immune system. Strategies to overcome these hurdles include, among others, early transplantation before 12?weeks of gestation, and increase of cells dose in the target organs (fetal liver and fetal bone marrow) which might be best achieved by the intravascular administration route. However, whilst ultrasound-guided intraperitoneal administration of the graft in the first trimester is feasible, access to the fetal circulation in the first trimester is more difficult. Combined ultrasound-guided/embryofetoscopic approach is a promising technique to achieve this goal. Thin-gauge embryofetoscopes allow the exact visualization of the optimal funipuncture site and the intravenous insertion of a 25G needle through a side-port. They thus provide an additional tool to deliver the stem cell graft to the preimmune fetus.

AB  - Background The possibility that the hyperstimulatory effect of gonadotropins may be important etiologically in the genesis of some cases of ovarian cancer is still under discussion. Few flow and image cytometric studies report on DNA aneuploid granulosa cells in follicular fluid from women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). The reports are very controversial. The aim of the study was to analyse relationship between ultrasound-determined follicular size and DNA ploidy of granulosa cells from gonadotropin-stimulated follicles. Method The granulosa-luteal cells were obtained from women undergoing an IVF-ET program at the University Department of obstetrics and Gynecology Ljubljana. Seventy aspirates of individual follicles (transvaginal determined size, range 15?mm ? 30?mm in diameter) from gonadotropin-stimulated cycles were analysed. Cytospins were prepared and fixed in delaunay fixative. All the slides were stained by the feulgen thionin method. Image DNA analyses was performed on automated high-resolution image cytometer. The DNA index was calculated to define DNA ploidy. Results All granulosa cell samples were found to be diploid. Conclusion Regardless of different ultrasound-determined size of follicles, all analysed granulosa cells have diploid DNA content.

AB  - We have researched operative histeroscopy in treating endometrial abnormalities as a cause of marital infertility. A group of 320 infertile patients was included in the study. Color Doppler examination detected endometrial abnormalities (subseptus, polyp, synechiae, myoma, uterus bicornuate, and uterus arcuate). The controlling group consisted of 100 patients suffering endometrial abnormalities, who have not underwent the operation. In research group, there were 9 pregnancies following operative histeroscopy over a period of 18?months. That is 34.6%, out of which 89 (27.8%) have been carried out and delivered. We have also studied the surgical risk of operative histeroscopy. According to the results, operative histeroscopy is minimally invasive, surgically comfortable, economically acceptable. The influence of histeroscopy on the endometrium during pregnancy and delivery is such that there is no significant difference in comparison to the patients that were not operated. The pregnancy following operative histeroscopy is phsysiological. The delivery has no implication of pathological nature, nor difference in duration, type, or any other component. The enonathological parameters do not differ from physiological

AB  - Early detection of breast cancer is of paramount importance for its management. Therefore, new diagnostic tools are continously searched, including 3D-US and 3D Power Doppler, and for later management, the study of the sentinel node. 3D ultrasonography (3-D US) may be of value in the differential diagnosis of the following conditions. Cysts Not all cysts display a typical US appearance. Small cysts may lack the distal sound enhancement. Inflammatory cysts may exhibit a thickened wall. However, the major problem it the not so rare presence of intracystic echoes, which may be either real or artifactual. Fibroadenomas A refraction artifact (edge shadowing) is often noted at each lateral margin of smooth-marginated fibroadenomas. Contours are irregular in about 25% of cases, and in about 5% shadowing makes it impossible to rule out malignancy. Carcinomas Shadowing is associated only with those carcinomas that have a significant amount of fibrosis (<?50% of cases in our experience). Some partial shadowing seen with some carcinomas may also be caused by beam scattering by jagged margins, with 3D scan potentially useful for diagnosis. The sentinel node. Axillary lymph node status is the most important pathological determinant of prognosis in early breast cancer, whereas local axillary lynphadenectomy is the most reliable staging procedure. However, routine axillary dissection does not benefit the majority of patients with early breast cancer who are node-negative, thereby sustaining the potential morbidity of the procedure. Sentinel node is the first regional node to receive lymph from the breast and accurately represents the metastatic status of the primary cancer. Sentinel node biopsy appears to offer an alternative to routine axillary lymph node dissection for staging patients with breast cancer. (Supported in part my MURST and CNR, Italy)

AB  - Fetal oncology is a chapter of the Obstetrics non well known yet. Fortunately, the improvements in the ultrasonography has let us to obtain an intrauterine diagnosis and to follow its evolution in order to choose the most appropriated obstetrical way. A total of 1326 fetal abnormalities has been diagnosed in the last 10 years in the Hospital ?La Paz?, Madrid, and we have found 54 cases of fetal tumours detected by ultrasonography (cyst and solid tumours included). This number of fetal tumours is estimated to be the 4.07% of all fetal abnormalities. Most frequent tumours include the fetal central nervous system, fetal lung, fetal heart, fetal genitourinary system, fetal gastrointestinal system. We have reviewed these fetal tumours histology, location and behaviour, trying to study the best obstetrical conduct and its chirurgical treatment. Ultrasonographic characteristic of each fetal tumour has been specified. Besides, we describe the possible differential diagnosis, maternal complications (preeclamptic status, mirror syndrome), obstetrical complications (polyhydramnios, preterm labour and delivery or placentomegaly) and fetal complications (cardiovascular failures, hydrops or death). Finally, we perform the indications for the spontaneous delivery or the preterm delivery induction depending on each case. Although we have not experience in intrauterine surgery, we believe that the best results are obtained in the neonatal surgery, always after an individual study and in agreement with the whole perinatal equipment.

AB  - Unstimulated cycles offer a simpler, quicker and less invasive form of IVF and ICSI than the most conventional stimulated cycles. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches for follicle monitoring in unstimulated cycles. This monitoring includes studies of follicle growth during the follicular and luteal phase of the cycle, measurements of blood flow in perifollicular vessels and studies of perifollicular perfusion in vascular network using power Doppler. These studies include 3D analysis of follicular growth, development and its vascularization. A retrospective chart review of all patients undergoing IVF and ICSI in unstimulated cycles at our institution was performed. The outcome measurements used were oocyte recovery rate, fertilization rate, implantation and delivery rate. Unstimulated cycles monitored by ultrasound only were compared with those monitored with different protocols of ultrasound monitoring combined with serum estradiol level and urinary LH. IVF and ICSI were performed in 708 unstimulated cycles. A higher pregnancy rate and lower cancellation rate was obtained when hCG was applied in lower values of serum E2 and smaller follicle diameter. The actual pregnancy rate per embryo transfer in IVF cycles was 23.8% and 26.4% in ICSI cycles when embryo transfer was performed on day?+?2 or day?+?3. When blastocyst stage embryo transfer was performed the implantation rate per embryo transfer was 37.5%.

AB  - Background This study was undertaken to evaluate the accuracy of transvaginal ultrasound combined with vaginal and endometrial cytology in detecting endometrial pathology in postmenopausal women. Method In all patients who underwent dilatation and curettage (D & C) for postmenopausal bleeding during four years endometrial thickness, vaginal and endometrial cytology were evaluated. Results Accuracy of endometrial thickness in detecting pathologic condition, like as polyp, hyperplasia and carcinoma was high sensitive but with low specificity. Combined use transvaginal ultrasound, vaginal and endometrial cytology show very high sensitivity and specificity for endometrial cancer. The combined use of three diagnostic methods show no benefit for other pathologic conditions. Conclusion Combination of transvaginal ultrasound, vaginal and endometrial cytology can not absolutely replace histologic findings obtained by D & C. However, in the cases with thin endometrium and negative cytology D & C could be avoided. Usefulness of these three methods has to be found in providing more information resulting in better understanding of endometrial condition.

AB  - In North America second trimester genetic ultrasound is offered to patients at risk for trisomy 21 and other chromosomal abnormalities who decline invasive testing. In most major studies in which the prevalence of ultrasound markers used for genetic ultrasound are reported, congenital heart defects are identified in less than 10% of fetuses. When one considers that over 50% of fetuses with trisomy 21 and 90% of fetuses with trisomies 13 and 18 have structural malformations of the heart, the question should be raised as to why the wide discrepancy in prevalence and detection rate of heart defects in these fetuses. The purpose of this presentation is to review the prevalence of CHD in fetuses with trisomy 21, trisomies 13 and 18, and all fetuses with chromosomal defects that were identified following second trimester amniocentesis. To ascertain the presence or absence of CHD, each fetus underwent a fetal echocardiographic study using real-time and color Doppler ultrasound at the time of genetic amniocentesis. The results of the study demonstrated the following: The detection rate for trisomy 21 (n?=?80) increased from 62% to 91% when examination of the fetal heart was performed. The detection rate for trisomy 18 (n?=?30) increased from 84%% to 97% when the cardiovascular system was evaluated. For fetuses with any chromosomal abnormality (n?=?103) advanced maternal age were examined, the examination of the heart increased the detection rate from 61% to 85%. Given the above findings, the inclusion of the fetal echocardiographic evaluation of the fetus significantly increased the detection rate for the above three groups of fetuses. If physicians and/or sonographers desire to increase the ultrasound detection rate for chromosomal abnormalities, examination of the fetal cardiovascular system must occur.

AB  - Objective To assess long-term neuodevelopmental outcome and structural reorganisation of children suffering hypoxic-ischemic (H-I) and/or haemorrhagic perinatal brain damage; To test the hypothesis of more successful recovery of prematures and/or unilateral lesions after perinatal brain damage; To estimate prenatal events, in particularly value of pathological findings of Color Doppler (CD) in the pathogenesis of perinatal brain damage; Study design 68 children suffering perinatal brain H-I (10) and/or haemorrhagic lesions (58) diagnosed by ultrasonography (US) underwent neurologic and psycho-linguistic examinations by age 16. High resolution 2 T MRI was used to assess structural reorganisation; 20 children suffering unilateral perinatal brain damage (MCA infarct.) were followed up (neurodevelopmentally, transcranial CD and US/CT, MRI); 25 children with CD findings (C/U ratio <?1) during pregnancy underwent prospective follow-up postnatally by age 2. Results All children with H-I lesions have still at age 16 one or more severe handicaps, while 39 children with mild grade of hemorrhage had minor neurological dysfunction, 15 were normal. MRI revealed destructive and/or atrophic lesions in all children with H-I lesions and mild atrophy and/or signs of preiventricular haemorrhage in rest children. 20 children with unilateral perinatal brain damage have contralateral hemiparesis and various accompanying neurodevelopmental disorders. There were no strict correlation between size, site, hemispheral involvement gestational age and neurodevelopmental outcome of children examined. Out of the 25 children having pathological CD findings during pregnancy, 7 revealed mild grade (I?II) of peri-intraventricular haemorrhage, 10 children isolated or combined H-I and haemorrhagic lesion, 7 children have no apparent perinatal brain damage. Short-term neuro-developmental outcome revealed mild delay and/or disorders in 10 infants and in the rest normal status.

AB  - Background To evaluate the preoperative clinical, laboratory and sonographic characteristics of struma ovarii. Method A retrospective review of gynecologic patients operated for mature cystic teratoma over a 10-year period, identified 16 cases of struma ovarii. These cases were the subject of this study and were compared to 32 cases of ovarian dermoid cysts. Results The incidence of struma ovarii among all cases of dermoid cysts was 4.8%. Most patients were menopausal, the mean lesion diameter was 57.3?mm, occurred more frequently (68.8%) in the right adnexa and presented with normal CA-125 level. Blood flow signals were detected from the center of the lesions in all cases. Rare cases presented with elevated tumor marker and low-resistance blood flow. In dermoid cycsts, blood flow had a higher resistive index. In addition, no blood flow could be detected from the center of the echogenic lesion in dermoid (P?<?0.0001). Conclusion It is difficult to distinguish between struma ovarii and dermoid cysts, based on their sonographic appearance. Nevertheless, Doppler flow may aid in the preoperative diagnosis of struma ovarii. Blood flow signals, detected from the center of the echogenic lesions and low resistance to flow may be more common in struma ovarii.
