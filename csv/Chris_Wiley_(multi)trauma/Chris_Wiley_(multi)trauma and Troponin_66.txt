AB  - The purpose of this project was to identify sources and clinical significance of 3DUS artifacts on patient diagnosis and to increase clinician and sonographer awareness to reduce misdiagnosis in 3DUS studies. To accomplish this 3DUS data were acquired and reviewed interactively. Artifacts were cataloged according to origin: B-mode, color/power Doppler or unique to 3DUS (acquisition, rendering or volume editing). Original scan planes, re-sliced planes and rendered images were evaluated. Overall our results showed a variety of artifacts. B-mode artifacts included drop-out, shadowing, etc. and depending on relationships between slice and imaging plane orientation. Color/power Doppler artifacts were related to gain, aliasing, and flash and could add apparent structure or confusion to the volume images. Rendering artifacts were due to parameter adjustment, shadowing and motion. Important structures could be removed by improper editing. In conclusion 3DUS and 2DUS are prone to similar artifacts plus others unique to 3DUS. Diagnostically significant artifacts can mimick abnormal development, masses, or missing structures thus requiring careful study before reaching a diagnosis.

AB  - Background The aim of this study was to compare the application of 2D neurosonography (USG) and 3D USG in newborns with respect to the time required to obtain the data for analysis. Method All newborns in whom neurosonography was indicated underwent 2D USG and 3D USG by the same investigator. The Voluson 530 D Color System was used with vaginal 5?8?MHz 3D probe for 3D imaging. 2D real-time imaging was performed with Aloka SSD 121 device using 5?MHz sector probe. The time needed to perform the examination was determined. Non-parametric Kruskal?Wallis rank sum test was used in statistical analysis. Results A total of 30 newborn infants of different gestational ages (ranging from 25 to 40?weeks) underwent USG after delivery at different postnatal ages (ranging from 2 to 60?days). The median time required to perform the 2D USG was 14?min (10?21). The median time required to perform the investigation by 3D USG was 5?min (ranging from 3 to 10). The difference was statistically significant (H?=?24.88; P?=?0.0031). The median time of data interpretation for 2D USG was 25?min (15?35), and for 3D USG it was 45?min (30?63). The difference was not statistically significant (H?=?13.22; P?=?0.1531). Conclusion The time necessary to obtain 3D USG compared to 2D USG images was shorter, which made it less stressful for the newborns. 3D USG provides more reliable information than 2D USG performed in the same patient at the same age. The time needed to interpret the data is longer for 3D USG but it can be performed after the imaging was terminated.

AB  - From animal studies it is known that fetus during hypoxia redistributes it's blood flow preferentially to the brain, heart and adrenal glands. In animal studies, a three-fold increase in adrenal blood flow has been demonstrated during hypoxia. The adrenals are relatively large organs in the fetus. Compared to fetal body weight, they are 20 times bigger than in the adult. The fetal adrenals respond to stress, such as hypoxemia by increased production of dihydroandrostendion (DHA), DHA sulfate and their metabolites. The adrenal gland is supplied by three arteries: the superior, coming from the inferior phrenic artery; the middle, from the abdominal aorta and inferior, arising from the renal artery. In the recent studies the Doppler signals were obtained from fetal middle adrenal artery. The normal adrenal PI shows decreasing values with the gestational age, which might suggest lower vascular resistance and high blood flow to the adrenals. From our observations the adrenal Doppler velocimetry is easier to record in fetuses from high-risk pregnancies than in normals, probably due to the adrenal sparing effect. Recent results suggest that the adrenal artery velocimetry might be useful in fetal assessment and predicting outcome. The ?adrenal-sparing? effect might be maintained at the same time the brain-sparing signs disappear.

AB  - ABSTRACT The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) Journal of Clinical Apheresis (JCA) Special Issue Writing Committee is charged with reviewing, updating and categorizing indications for the evidence-based use of therapeutic apheresis (TA) in human disease. Since the 2007 JCA Special Issue (Fourth Edition), the committee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approaches in the grading and categorization of apheresis indications. This Eighth Edition of the JCA Special Issue continues to maintain this methodology and rigor in order to make recommendations on the use of apheresis in a wide variety of diseases/conditions. The JCA Eighth Edition, like its predecessor, continues to apply the category and grading system definitions in fact sheets. The general layout and concept of a fact sheet that was introduced in the Fourth Edition, has largely been maintained in this edition. Each fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of TA in a specific disease entity or medical condition. The Eighth Edition comprises 84 fact sheets for relevant diseases and medical conditions, with 157 graded and categorized indications and/or TA modalities. The Eighth Edition of the JCA Special Issue seeks to continue to serve as a key resource that guides the utilization of TA in the treatment of human disease.

AB  - Our first purpose was to describe embryonic anatomic structures by use of IUS with a 20-MHz flexible catheter-based, high resolutions, real-time miniature transducer. The number and the clarity of structures increased from 7 to 8?weeks of gestation; however, the image quality was degenerated because of the increasing fetal size at 9?weeks. At 8?weeks secondary brain vesicles, spine, midgut herniation, liver, upper and lower limb buds, and sacral tail were visualized in all fetuses. The four-chamber view was first identified at 8?weeks, as were fingers or toes. The stomach was first noted at 9?weeks. Second purpose was to compare the ultrasound visualization of the early first-trimester embryo using TVS and IUS as 6?8?weeks of gestation. The ability to view most organs was better with IUS compared to TVS, and this was especially true for the brain, spine, heart, liver, midgut herniation, extremities, and sacral tail. Moreover, it was possible to obtain finer image quality of very small embryonic structures with IUS than with TVS. Third purpose was to evaluate embryonic organ growth (liver, heart, and brain vesicles) using IUS in the early first trimester of pregnancy. The significant good correlation between each parameter and gestational age was obtained. Fourth purpose was to visualize normal embryonal surface anatomic structures using 3D-IUS at 7?9.9?weeks gestational age. At week 8, prominent forehead was evident, and upper and lower limbs and midgut herniation were clearly depicted. At week 9, fingers and toes were depicted as small digital rays, and the sacral tail protruded caudally. At week 10, embryonic face and fingers were clearly shown.

AB  - Background The optimal time at which to perform obstetric ultrasound remains controversial. Late first trimester imaging offers the possibility for early diagnosis of structural and genetic abnormalities. Three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS) allows the entire first trimester conceptus to be contained within one or two volumes of data. Subsequent processing of this data allows optimized views of the fetus, placenta and cord to be obtained. Method Late first trimester (?12?week) pregnancies were imaged with transvaginal 3DUS. A fetal structural survey was performed, standard biometry obtained and nuchal translucency thickness (NTT) measured. The time taken to perform and assess the scans was recorded. Results A comprehensive fetal survey was obtained, fetal measurements made and NTT measured in most fetuses with average scan times of less than one minute and average volume assessment times of less than 10?min in all cases. There were no abnormal findings in this series. Conclusion 3DUS appears to be a useful tool in the ultrasound evaluation of the 12?week fetus. A detailed examination of the fetus may be performed with minimal scan time offering exciting possibilities for the use of transvaginal 3DUS as a ?one step? screening examination.

AB  - An HRT-associated reduction of the pulsatility index (PI) has been reported in the literature, although cross-sectional studies have shown conflicting data. In a prospective, controlled study we randomized 30 healthy postmenopausal women (mean age 52?±?3?years) into two groups. Women in the HRT group (N?=?15) received 1?mg micronized 17?-estradiol daily (E2) sequentially combined with 5 or 10?mg dydrogesterone for 14?days of each 28-day cycle during 12?months, and, thereafter, 2?mg E2 combined with 10?mg dydrogesterone for a period of 3?months. The control group (N?=?15) received no treatment. Color Doppler ultrasound was used to measure the impedance to flow (pulsatility index [PI]) within the uterine, central retinal and ophthalmic arteries in the E2-phase at baseline and after 3, 12 and 15?months. Compared to controls, 12 months of HRT was associated with a significant decrease in the mean PI of the uterine artery of ?39% (HRT ?25%, controls +14%) and in that of the central retinal artery of ?29% (HRT ?9%, controls +20%). After 3?months this effect was already evident. During HRT, the reductions in mean PI of the uterine and central retinal arteries vs. baseline were larger (both P?=?0.002) in the women with high pretreatment PI values when compared to those with low pretreatment values. The baseline PI of the uterine artery correlated positively with age and with duration of amenorrhoea (r?=?0.42, P?=?0.01 and r?=?0.48, P?=?0.008, respectively). Our 12-month study expanded on earlier reports of a reduced PI of the uterine artery. We used a combined regimen containing a low-dose of oestrogens. These results are important because the recent trend is to recommend combined HRT that contain lower dosages of oestrogens than before. Furthermore, a 29% reduction of the PI of the central retinal artery was observed, which suggests that HRT has a positive influence on the impedance of the cerebral circulation. From the point of view of atherothrombotic risk these observations are beneficial and possibly helpful in understanding the decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, and of the impairment of cognitive functions associated with oestrogens in epidemiological data.

AB  - Objective In pregnancies complicated by preterm premature rupture of the membranes (pPROM) there are essentially two causes of perinatal death: prematurity and lung hypoplasia. We used ultrasound to try to predict these complications. Design and methods The cervical length was measured by transvaginal ultrasound in 167 pregnancies complicated by pPROM <?32?weeks of gestation. Further in 20 pregnancies with pPROM before 24?weeks of gestation peripheral pulmonary artery (PPA) waveforms were recorded by Doppler technique at weekly interval until delivery and the Pulsatility Index (PI) calculated. Pregnancies were managed conservatively according to an Institutional management protocol. The occurrence of preterm delivery and pulmonary hypoplasia was evaluated and related to ultrasound findings. Results The cervical length at admission predicts the time interval elapsing between pPROM and delivery. Significant differences in PI values from PPA were present from 2?weeks onwards the pPROM between the fetuses who developed pulmonary hypoplasia and those with a normal outcome. Conclusion The measurement of the cervical length and of PPA velocity waveforms may help to establish the risk of developing prematurity and pulmonary hypoplasia in pregnancies complicated by pPROM.

AB  - Traditionally, the prenatal assessment of the umbilical cord (UC) is limited to the assessment of the number of vessels and to the evaluation of umbilical artery blood flow parameters. Morphologic aspects of the UC have usually been studied by pathologists and retrospectively correlated with the perinatal outcome. The introduction of more sophisticated imaging techniques have offered the possibility to investigate the UC characteristics during fetal life from early to late gestation. A number of investigations have demonstrated that an altered structure of the UC can be associated with pathologic conditions (i.e. preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, diabetes, fetal demise). Nomograms of the various UC components have been generated and allow the identification of lean or large umbilical cords, entities frequently associated with fetal growth abnormalities and diabetes, respectively. Of note, lean UC in the second and third trimester differs from normal UC not only from a structural point of view but also in the umbilical vein blood flow characteristics. On the other hand a thin UC in the first trimester seems to be a marker for identifying a subset of fetuses at risk for spontaneous abortion and pre-eclampsia. A Wharton's jelly reduction has also been invoked as a possible cause of fetal death in the presence of single umbilical artery. Prenatal morphometric and morphologic UC characteristics as well as UC arterial and venous blood flow parameters in normal and pathologic conditions will be presented and discussed.

AB  - Objectives Our purpose was to evaluate the risks of malignancy in surgically removed ovarian cysts that preoperatively were characterized as unilocular by transvaginal sonography. Study design This prospective analysis included 1307 women operated at two European university Hospitals between January 1992 and December 1997. Based on ultrasonographic findings the cysts were characterized either as echo-free, without solid parts or papillary formations (group I) or cysts with solid parts/papillary formations or echogenic cyst content (group II). Ultrasonographic and macroscopic appearance of the cysts were compared with histopathological diagnosis. Results In group I seven of 670 (1.1%) proved to be borderline or malignant, and all measured ≥?75?mm in diameter. The corresponding figures for cysts in group II were 24 of 634 (3.8%). The frequency of borderline/malignant cysts increased significantly with the size of the cysts. Conclusion Unilocular, echo-free cysts (group I) with a mean diameter above 50?mm and all unilocular cysts with solid parts/papillary formations should be removed surgically. Serial ultrasound follow-up should be the standard procedure of unilocular, echo-free cysts less than 50?mm.

AB  - Background Intracardiac echogenic foci are controversially discussed whether or not they are marker for chromosomal aberrations. The possible association with fetal congenital heart defects (CHD) and its impact were not yet analyzed extensively. Method During 30?months, prenatally detected structural CHD were prospectively analyzed for the presence of EF. Frequency, localization, number, association with chromosomal defects and pattern of CHD were assessed. Results 279 fetal CHD could be examined and EF were found in 31 cases (11.1%). The localization was in 17 cases (54%) the left, in 7 (22%) the right, and in 7 (22.5%) both ventricles. Multiple EF were found in 10 cases. 14 cases (42%) were associated with a chromosomal aberration (T18 n?=?2; T21 n?=?5, T13 n?=?3, Triploidy n?=?2, Del22q n?=?1, others n?=?1). Among the remaining 17 fetuses with normal chromosomes following heart defects were found: 3???VSD, 3???Left-persistent SVC, 2???TGA, 2???TOF, 2???Coarctation, and 1???PS, PA, Ebstein, TAC, AS each. Conclusions Compared to low-risk groups EF are more frequent in the presence of CHD and show another distribution involving more right ventricular or bilateral EF. The combination of EF and CHD is highly associated with aneuploidies. Since associated CHD include also conotruncal anomalies EF can be considered as an indication for targeted fetal echocardiography especially when EF is localized in the RV or in both ventricles.

AB  - At present there are four concepts guiding the sonographic examination of the fetal heart: (1) the fetal echocardiogram (FEC) is difficult to perform and time-consuming, (2) FEC should be performed only in high risk pregnancies, (3) the optimal time to perform FEC is 18?22?weeks gestation, (4) FEC relies on several sonographic still views. In our lecture, we will present a new systemic ?video? approach to the great vessels and the four chambers in early pregnancy using transvaginal sonography. Transvaginal ultrasound examination of the cardiovascular system was performed in 36?323 consecutive fetuses using a dynamic ?video? multidirectional approach. Cardiovascular anomalies were detected in 173 fetuses giving an overall incidence of 1 in 210 pregnancies and 1 in 238 low-risk pregnancies. Fifty-six percent of the fetuses had associated anomalies. The prenatal diagnosis was confirmed in 90 cases. In 10 fetuses a different cardiac anomaly was observed. In four fetuses the cardiovascular anomaly was not detected in early pregnancy. In the remaining cases, postmortem examination was not performed. Early fetal heart examination is suggested in all pregnancies. Conclusions Fetal ECC should be performed: (a) transvaginally, (b) in early pregnancy (14?16?weeks), (c) in every pregnancy , (d) using the video multidirectional approach.

AB  - Background Fetal growth is determined by its genetic potential and growth support. The aim of our prospective study was to find out does the growth support (placental factor and blood flow) or genetic potential play a primary role in fetal growth. Method From 27 to 41 gestational weeks an umbilical artery (RI1), a middle cerebral artery resistance index (RI2) and umbilical-cerebral (U/C) ratio were measured. Several US measurements in 3?4?week intervals of the same pregnancy were done. After delivery, fetuses were divided into the three groups (AGA, LGA, SGA) according to their birth-weights. Pregnancies with gestational diabetes were excluded from the study. Results There were not statistically significant differences between the average values of RI1 (age related) in the groups of AGA and LGA fetuses. However, the mean values of RI1 (according to gestational age) in the mentioned two groups of fetuses were significantly lower than in the group of SGA fetuses, as well as their mean values of U/C ratios. Conclusion Placental factor is equally and efficiently functioning in the both groups of AGA and LGA fetuses. The genetic regulating factor of fetal growth can be adequately expressed in conditions of appropriate uteroplacental and umbilical blood supply. In other words, in identical or at least similar conditions of umbilical blood supply, fetal growth is exclusively influenced by its genetic potential.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is now defined as a condition in which the fetus does not reach the optimal condition of his growth. In this situation the birthweight can be reduced below the 10th percentile or can be superior to that threshold especially when the restriction took first place in late part of the pregnancy. Therefore it is possible to identify two groups of IUGR according to the intrauterine observation and the birthweight assessment: SGA and AGA IUGR. The most important complication of IUGR is represented by the hypoxaemia caused by placental vasculopathy. Hypoxaemia is present in about 30% of IUGR fetuses with not significant difference between SGA and AGA IUGR cases, and is the major cause of the poor perinatal outcome. After recognition of the growth restriction it is necessary to apply second level tests in order to assess the presence or absence of hypoxaemia. When hypoxaemia is present the first mechanism of fetal adaptation is represented by the redistribution of the circulation. This phenomenon is easily observable by using Doppler technology. When applying the same technique on the umbilical arteries it is possible to detect an increase in the peripheral resistance proportional to the obliteration of the placental vascular bed that is the cause of the fetal hypoxaemia. By using the information offered by Doppler study on fetal and umbilical vessels it is therefore possible to optimize the clinical management of the IUGR fetuses.

AB  - Objective The 3D Color Histogram gives quantitative informations about (changes) of perfusion and vascularisation packed in indices. Aim of the presentation is to illustrate the information gained by the vascularisation and perfusion indices. In addition, to show the reproducibility of the indices according to published studies, preliminary results (transvaginal) obtained in ovarian tumors and preliminary results in phantom measurements to correct the decrease in signal power with depth of insonation using a 3D abdominal probe. Results Color Histogram indices are reproducible. Differences of perfusion and vascularisation between benign and malignant ovarian tumors could be observed in a limited number of investigations. The physical component of the decrease in signal power with depth of insonation could be calculated by mathematical algorythms according to first phantom measurements. Conclusion The 3D Color Histogram gives new possibilities to analyse neoangiogenesis.

AB  - Background Two methods are presented for the assessment of fetal behaviours under the application of Doppler effects: (a) Measurement of the velocity wave of fetal limb by vibroacustic stimulating. (b) Hydrodynamic evaluation of the transnasal amniotic velocity wave and its relation to gastric peristalsis. Method A Doppler device was employed to assess the velocimetry wave from the ?FEMORAL BONE? in motion, following vibro-acoustic stimulation in 138 phisiological pregnancy and Doppler-aided evaluation of transnasal amniotic hydrodynamics. Results and conclusion Assessment of normal fetal behaviour. Quantification of patterns of reactivity of any body structure. Reduction in the duration of explorations for biophysical profiles. (3?4?min). Fetal reflex responses slow down and become increasingly complex as maturation carries on. Both mean velocity and acceleration of fetal reactive responses experience a gradual decline throughout gestation. The time a fetus takes to respond to a stimulus increases directly with gestational age. Simultaneousness between fetal respiration episodes and phases of gastric distention and activity. (physiological conditions). Fetal active respiration can be unequivocally accounted for by Doppler assessment of the activity of intake/release of amniotic fluid along the high respiratory branches of the pulmonary tree. Amniotic respiratory dynamics are always transnasal in physiological conditions. Velocities of transnasal, decreasing steadily from the 32nd gestational age to the end of gestation.

AB  - Aim To assess agreement between fetal cord blood Hb concentration by Doppler velocimetry and a formula (Oepkes et al, Br J Obstet Gynaecol 1994; 101:680?4), and the actual Hb concentration by cord blood sampling. Material and methods A prospective cohort of 31 Rh isoimmunised fetuses undergoing Doppler cord blood velocity measurements within the 24 hs previous to cordocentesis or delivery was included. Mean aortic velocity at descent fetal aorta and maximum umbilical vein flow at intrahepatic portion were measured blindly by a single operator with pulsed Doppler and a 3.5 Mhz transducer. Cord Hb was the gold standard. Abnormality and normality were defined as a Hb level lower and higher, respectively, than the cut-off point (<7, <8, <9, <10, <11 and <12 g/dL were tested). Likelihood ratio was also calculated. Results Interval between Doppler study and cordocentesis/delivery was 24?48 hs. Fetal blood sampling was performed by cordocentesis in 4 cases, following a C-section in 24, and following vaginal delivery in 3. 1 Distribution of cases according to results obtained (n cases) Cut-off point <7g <8g <9g <10g <11g <12g True+ 1 5 7 14 23 26 False+ 1 1 7 7 6 5 True? 29 25 15 7 2 0 False? 0 0 2 3 0 0 2 (abstract WS15-07) Agreement at different cut-off points in the diagnosis of abnormality and normality [point estimate (CI)] Cut-off <7 <8 <9 <10 <11 <12 Abn. 50(5?100) 83(36?99) 43(21?69) 58(37?77) 79(60?91) 84(66?94) Norm. 97(81?100) 96(78?100) 62(41?80) 41(17?67) 25(4?64) 0(0?54) LR 30(2.3?129.8) 26(4.2?132.4) 2.7(1.2?5.9) 1.6(1?3) 1.3(1?2.4) 1(0.9?2) Conclusion An acceptable agreement was found. Further population-based studies are required to corroborate its clinical significance.

AB  - The prenatal diagnosis of fetal malformations seems to be a very difficult challenge, mainly for those who are beginning with the practice of ultrasound. As it would be impossible to refer to so many fetal malformations the presentation will cover a few interesting issues. These cases are not frequently diagnosed and in many cases present controversial aspects referred to their prognosis and management. Those topics are: Unilateral ventricular dilatation Fetal hyperechogenic lung lesions Umbilical vein varix Facial clefts Unilateral ventricular dilatation may be a difficult diagnosis and its prognosis is variable Fetal hyperechogenic lesions include a broad range of anomalies with a variable behaviour. Even large lesions can disappear in utero but often the lesion can persist with severe prognosis for the fetus. Varix of the umbilical vein is a relatively uncommon abnormality that carries an increased risk for fetal demise, chromosomal abnormality and hydrops. Facial clefts are a relatively common malformation and the fetal face must be properly scanned in every fetal study. 3D ultrasound helps a lot in the diagnosis of these and other malformations and we'll discuss some examples concerning this new technology.
