AB  - From animal studies it is known that fetus during hypoxia redistributes it's blood flow preferentially to the brain, heart and adrenal glands. In animal studies, a three-fold increase in adrenal blood flow has been demonstrated during hypoxia. The adrenals are relatively large organs in the fetus. Compared to fetal body weight, they are 20 times bigger than in the adult. The fetal adrenals respond to stress, such as hypoxemia by increased production of dihydroandrostendion (DHA), DHA sulfate and their metabolites. The adrenal gland is supplied by three arteries: the superior, coming from the inferior phrenic artery; the middle, from the abdominal aorta and inferior, arising from the renal artery. In the recent studies the Doppler signals were obtained from fetal middle adrenal artery. The normal adrenal PI shows decreasing values with the gestational age, which might suggest lower vascular resistance and high blood flow to the adrenals. From our observations the adrenal Doppler velocimetry is easier to record in fetuses from high-risk pregnancies than in normals, probably due to the adrenal sparing effect. Recent results suggest that the adrenal artery velocimetry might be useful in fetal assessment and predicting outcome. The ?adrenal-sparing? effect might be maintained at the same time the brain-sparing signs disappear.

AB  - ABSTRACT The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) Journal of Clinical Apheresis (JCA) Special Issue Writing Committee is charged with reviewing, updating and categorizing indications for the evidence-based use of therapeutic apheresis (TA) in human disease. Since the 2007 JCA Special Issue (Fourth Edition), the committee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approaches in the grading and categorization of apheresis indications. This Eighth Edition of the JCA Special Issue continues to maintain this methodology and rigor in order to make recommendations on the use of apheresis in a wide variety of diseases/conditions. The JCA Eighth Edition, like its predecessor, continues to apply the category and grading system definitions in fact sheets. The general layout and concept of a fact sheet that was introduced in the Fourth Edition, has largely been maintained in this edition. Each fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of TA in a specific disease entity or medical condition. The Eighth Edition comprises 84 fact sheets for relevant diseases and medical conditions, with 157 graded and categorized indications and/or TA modalities. The Eighth Edition of the JCA Special Issue seeks to continue to serve as a key resource that guides the utilization of TA in the treatment of human disease.

AB  - Objective Since August 1998 we used the integrated 3-D software with the Siemens Elegra in order to evaluate fetoplacental vessels in the 3-D mode. Aim of the evaluation was to examine the feasibility of the application and to demonstrated potential clinical advantages. Methods In our antenatal clinic we recruited pregnant women between 12 and 38?weeks of gestation to take part in a feasibility study in order to evaluate the free-hand 3-D application using the 5.0?MHz transducer for routine antenatal scanning. We examined vasculatore within the placenta, intrathoracoabdominal and intracranial fetal vessels with the integrated powermode. Acquisition time for a volume date set is between 3 and 20?s depending on the resolution selected. Results Three-dimensional examination of the fetoplacental vessels is easily available using the Siemens Elegra, because no change in transducer is necessary. Our preliminary data show that we are able to demonstrate the complexity of intraplacental vasculature, which may be clinically helpful in the evaluation of twin placentas. Within the fetus the spatial arrangement of the vessels and their relation to each other can be depicted. This allows to study the fetal vascular tree and clearly discloses vascular anomalies. Conclusions Application of the integrated 3-D software within the Siemens Elegra for the first time allows the examination of the complex fetoplacental vascular tree in vivo. This may be clinically helpful in the differential diagnosis of fetal anomalies.

AB  - Doppler velocimetry give possibility of making noninvasive evaluation of the vascular modifications from the beginning of pregnancy. We have studied following vessels: Retrocorial arteries The flow increases since sixth to twelfth weeks, progressively which is explained by the increment of the conductancy and the reduction of resistance. Trophoblastic invasion of spirals arteries in the coral bed, and hormones produced during the gestation affect both values. Uterine arteries The resistance of the uterine arteries diminish since sixth to twelfth weeks, in normal pregnancy. The low increment depends on the modifications in the coral bed and of hormonal vasodilator effect. OVF Luteum gravidicus When ovary flow is greater in first stage of pregnancy suggest a favorable early gestation, and vice versa, a regress in those measures had a negative character. We could evaluate the role of Doppler examinations in the following situations: ? Abortion in any stage and variations ? Blighted ovum ? Ectopic pregnancy In all these conditions, Doppler showed to be a trusty, predictive, prognostical and diagnostical instrument of great utility. Clinical application of Doppler Uterus Corial could be used in a preventive way when the increment of the resistance in the uterine arteries appears before clinical abortion symptoms. We also applied Doppler exploration in AVF patients confirming that the deficit in uterine perfusion is significantly related with the failures in embryonary implantation. Recently, we are performing endovaginal color Doppler in the diagnoses of early ectopic gestation and trophoblastic disease with very satisfactory results.

AB  - Subacute or chronic fetal hypoxia is associated with an increase in fetal erythropoietin (EPO) synthesis irrespective of the etiology of hypoxia. Amniotic fluid (AF) EPO level is often elevated in diabetic pregnancies (especially in macrosomic fetuses), and in pregnancies complicated by hypertension (HT), pre-eclampsia (PE) or/and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). It is shown that cerebro-umbilical arterial flow ratio (RIC/RIU) is often abnormal (less than 1) in the case of fetal hypoxia. We studied AF EPO levels in 29 diabetic pregnancies, 18 pregnancies with HT, PE or/and IUGR and 19 healthy controls. The samples were obtained during the elective amniocenteses in the case of suspected fetal hypoxia or during caesarean sections. Doppler measurements were performed not more than 24?h before amniocenesis. AF EPO levels were significantly elevated in diabetics with abnormal fetal growth (either macrosomia or IUGR) and nondiabetics with HT, PE or/and IUGR as compared with healthy controls or diabetics with normal fetal growth. AF EPO levels of fetuses with normal fetal growth in diabetic mothers were not different from those of healthy controls. There was no correlation between AF EPO levels and RIC/RIU in any of the diabetic or nondiabetic group. However, 5 fetuses had either absent end-diastolic or reversed umbilical flow. All had elevated AF EPO levels (range 16?15?800?mU/ml). We conclude that both fetal macrosomia and IUGR in diabetic pregnancies seem to cause chronic fetal hypoxia. Normal fetal growth in diabetic pregnancies is not associated with chronic fetal hypoxia. Single measurement of RIC/RIU is of little value in the diagnosis of chronic fetal hypoxia in abnormal pregnancies.

AB  - Objective Treatment of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy is complicated by the lack of readily available measures of the fetal thyroid status. Both hyper- and hypo-thyroidism of the fetus may have short and long-term detrimental effects and thus should be avoided. We therefore followed the fetal thyroidal size during treatment of maternal thyroid disorders and correlated the data with treatment and thyroidal status in the mother. Methods During 24-month period 20 patients with thyroid disorders were referred for serial fetal thyroid measurements. Thyroid size was measured by transvaginal ultrasonography between 14 and 17?weeks' of gestation and by abdominal ultrasonography between 18 and 38?weeks' gestation. Results In five women with Grave's diseases correlation between thionamide dosage and fetal thyroid size were noted. Two fetuses had an increase in the size of thyroid gland above the upper 95% confidence interval, one of them developed neonatal Grave's of which it was the only prenatal sign of fetal thyroid abnormalities. In all other three fetuses changes inthyroidal size aided in determining the dosage of the antithyroidal drugs. Conclusions Inutero ultrasonographic measurements of the fetal thyroid size can be used as a noninvasive tool for the proper management of maternal hyperthyroidism.

AB  - Aim To prevent the syndrome of severe ovarian hyperstimulation in IVF/ET cycles at high risk for the syndome of ovarian hyperstimulation by early timed unilateral ultrasound guided aspiration of one ovary (12?h after hCG). Method. We evaluated the preventive effect of ETFA by analysing the data on 821 cycles at high risk for SOHSS performed during the years 1987?99. In all cycles the high risk for SOHSS was defined by the estradiol values >?3000?pg/ml and more than 8 follicles >?14?mm plus intermediate and small follicles in each ovary on ultrasound. Results In the group of :729 female infertility cycles at high risk for SOHSS with preventive ETFA there were no cases of SOHSS. In the control group of 92 IVF/ET female infertility without ETFA there were 12 cases of SOHSS (P?<?0.0001). No difference in live birth rate (17% vs. 16%) was noted. The results prove the preventive effect of ETFA. It is based on early timed withdrawal of paracine substances which are present in the follicular fluid. Conclusion The vaginal ultrasound guided ETFA is another successful option to decrease the incidence of severe OHSS in assisted reproduction.

AB  - The regulation and significance of ovarian and uterine haemodynamics in human reproductive pathophysiology has been largely studied. In women, ovarian vascularization seems to be responsible for the selection and maturation of follicles both in spontaneous and stimulated IVF cycles while endometrial receptivity is related to uterine blood flow and implicated in the achievement of pregnancy. In patients who underwent to IVF cycles, the PI of both uterine and spiral arteries is significantly lower in patients who became pregnant in comparison with nonpregnant and is associated with significantly lower endometrial cell thromboxane concentrations than non pregnant patients. In poor responders women it has been demonstrated the role of l-arginine in improving uterine and follicular Doppler flow and in increasing ovarian response to gonadotrophin. Recently, in a total of 41 patients undergoing to assisted reproduction, an higher number of oocytes collected and embryos transferred was observed in normo-responders than in poor-responders patients. Furthermore follicular vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) resulted inversely correlated with retrieved oocytes (r?=??0.942; p?=?0.0017). In addition significant higher uterine and perifollicular Doppler flow resistances were observed in poor-responders women. The pregnancy rate/cycle was significantly higher in normo-responders (26%) than poor-responders (6%; p?=?0.037) patients. In conclusion, vasoactive substances improve ovarian response to gonadotrophin and allow a better management of ovarian stimulation in infertile patients.

AB  - Hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) offers multiple benefits and some risks to many postmenopausal women, especially to those whose menopause occurred before age 45. Improvements of image resolution by transvaginal sonography allow the investigation of very delicate anatomical structures such as the endometrium. Various diagnostic criteria including thickness and volume of endometrium, internal structure and myometrial involvement help to identify endometrial abnormality. The benefits of technologies such as sonohysterography, Doppler and 3D ultrasound are being assessed. In the postmenopausal patient without hormonal substitution, endometrial pathology may be diagnosed by measuring endometrial thickness alone. In women with postmenopausal bleeding, endometrial atrophy as the must common cause has been differentiated from endometrial cancer with a high success rate. Considering that the majority of diagnostic endometrial biopsies reveal a benign pathology, Doppler ultrasound may significantly reduce the number of these procedures. In patients with HRT, the measurement of endometrial thickness is not reliable to predict pathology. In this situation, ultrasound examination of the endometrial/myometrial border or endometrial blood flow is advantageous. Transvaginal ultrasound and Doppler blood flow analysis could prove helpful in selection and follow up of patients on HRT and maybe to prevent some unwanted endometrial effects.

AB  - There is a potential role of ultrasound examination in the management of women with postmenopausal (PMP) bleeding. Because women with an endometrium = 4?mm at transvaginal ultrasound examination rarely have endometrial pathology, it may be justified not to sample their endometrium. However, endometrial pathology is common among women with endometrium = 5?mm. In our prospective study, 105 consecutive women with PMP bleeding and endometrium = 5?mm underwent hydrosonography, hysteroscopy, D  Kappa 0.77), but neither hysteroscopy nor hydrosnography could reliably discriminate between benign and malignant lesions. In a randomized trial, 49 women with PMP bleeding and endometrium = 4?mm were randomized to D & C and 48 to ultrasound follow up. 14 (29%) women in the D & C group and 22 (46%) in the ultrasound group had either rebleeding or manifested endometrial growth during a 12-month follow-up period. Endometrial pathology was not found in women with rebleeding unless the endometrium was?=?5?mm. Conclusion Women with PMP bleeding and endometrium = 5?mm should undergo hydrosnography. If focal lesions are detected hysteroscopic resection should be carried out. In women with PMP bleeding, rebleeding during the first 12?months is an indication to sample the endometrium only if the endometrium measures = 5?mm at ultrasound examination.

AB  - Objective Fetal lung anomalies are traditionally classified into Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation (CCAM), and Pulmonary Sequestration (PS). During last years we have detected several cases who presented with bizarre and overlapping findings which could not be fitted into this usual classification. We therefore suggest a new approach for classification based on embryology, 2-D and Doppler ultrasound. Method During 5-year period, patients with fetal lung lesions who were referred for detailed ultrasound evaluation at the Sheba Medical Center from the data base of this study. All cases were analyzed by 2-D ultrasound and high resolution Power Doppler technology and were classified into three major categories: I Agenesis of lung; II Lung lesion with normal vascular supply: IIa solid, IIb cystic, IIc mixed; III Lung Lesion with abnormal vascular supply: IIIa chest, IIIb abdomen, IIIc thoracoabdomial. Medical files, natural history and neonatal follow-up were recorded. Results Twenty-one fetuses were recruited, two fetuses were detected in group one, 14 in group II of normal vascular supply, and five in group III abnormal lung with abnormal vascular involvement. Conclusions Based on embryology and ultrasound a new classification system is introduced.

AB  - Background Recent reports have shown a significantly improved survival for complex congenital heart disease (CHD) when detected antenatally. This has further substantiated the need to detect CHD in utero. Since the performance of the 4-chamber view as a screening tool is rather insufficient, the issue is now to find more effective and not too expensive alternative methods to reach this aim. Method The cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is an efficient method to assess health outcomes and resource costs of health interventions. We have applied this tool to prenatal detection of CHD, comparing 3 models: (1) 4-chamber view at level I; (2) outflow tracts at level I; (3) Outflow tracts at level II. To perform the analysis we have made the following assumptions: (1) the incidence of CHD at 20?weeks is 10/1000; (2) the percentage of severe CHD is 40%; (3) the monthly salary are 2500 USD and 3500 USD for level I and level II operators, respectively; (4) detection rate for CHD detectable on the 4-chamber view and on outflows only are 35%/20%, 60%/60%, and 90%/90% for the three options (level I 4-chamber, level I outflows, level II outflows). Results and conclusions Based on the forementioned assumptions, the costs for (1) a diagnosis of CHD; (2) a diagnosis of severe CHD; (3) TOP of any CHD; TOP of a severe CHD are reported below. These results, which were also submitted to sensitivity analyses, will be discussed. Costs Outcome Level I 4-ch. Level I ?Outflows Level II ?Outflows Det.

AB  - Over a year I invited you here to participate to the rct for treating twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTS). Are there any data available to reconsider this? The answer is clearly no, on the contrary. Indeed large series on amniodrainage or laser therapy have become available. With serial amniodrainage overall survival for both twins is 49% or 71% where at least one baby survive. In cases where one fetus dies in utero, 20% of the survivors die, and in another 20% they have severe neurological morbidity. Laser treatment has now a survival rate of 54% for both twins and 81% for at least one survivor. Neurological morbidity seems to be less than 10%. Has this larger experience contributed to solve the question whether one or the other therapy is better? No, it only underscores that our estimate of the number of patients needed in a rct was right: 10% difference in survival rate and 15% for severe neonatal morbidity. All new data, all new studies are an urgent call for randomisation. If not, both patients and their obstetricians will continue to argue based on unsubstantiated views. Further case series will not bring any critically new element. Results Over 45 patients have now been included, all but a few in France. If we would extrapolate the number of patients randomised at our centre, only three other groups would have to recruit at the same pace to reach the 142 patients needed by the end of next year. Discussion There are many arguments to try to finish the study within a few years. It avoids the obvious bias due to improvements of perinatal resuscitation. It would keep high motivation amongst referring clinicians. I would dare to say more: at this point it has become unethical not to randomise cases with TTTS. Not laser, neither amniodrainage have become established yet as the best treatment and there is no room for empirical new techniques until the trial is completed.
