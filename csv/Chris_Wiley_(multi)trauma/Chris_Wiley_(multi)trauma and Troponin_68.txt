AB  - Objective In about 80% of fetuses with trisomies, Turner syndrome, and in fetuses with skeletal abnormalities, genetic syndromes, structural abnormalities and cardiac defects, there is increased collection of fluid in the neck region. This can be visualized sonographically at 11?14?weeks of gestation as increased nuchal translucency thickness. The pathophysiology of this common phenotypic expression of different chromosomal abnormalities is uncertain, but there is some evidence that the underlying mechanism may be altered composition of extracellular matrix components and/or cardiac failure. Methods We performed a number of studies investigating nuchal skin tissue for various extracellular matrix components and cardiac heart failure using molecular techniques. We used northern blotting, immunohistochemistry, electron-microscopy and in situ hybridization. Results Studies investigating the heart found increased levels of mRNA for ANP and BNP, and reduced levels of Calcium ATPase, whereas transcript levels for GATA-4 were unchanged. Studies investigating components of the extracellular matrix in nuchal skin of trisomic fetuses found overexpression of ecm genes in trisomies (collagen type VI, collagen type IV, laminin) or an altered ratio of genes between normals and abnormals (collagen type VI). Conclusions The present data provide some evidence, that chromosomally abnormal fetuses with increased nuchal translucency at 12?14?week may suffer from an altered extracellular matrix of the heart and skin or transient heart failure.

AB  - Objective To verify the existence of a relationship between maternal cardiac function and peripheral hemodynamic parameters in normal and gestational hypertensive women. Methods 43 normotensive primigravidae were evaluated at 12?±?1, 21?±?1, and 33?±?1?weeks of gestation with uterine artery color Doppler and maternal echocardiographic examination comparing data of the third trimester with those of 21 gestational hypertensive women. Results The 43 healthy women showed a decrease in Uterine Resistance Index (RI) from I° to II° trimester (0.72?±?0.10 vs. 0.54?±?0.09, P?<?0.001) and modifications in Diastolic function parameters: E wave velocity and E/A ratio decreased; A wave velocity and deceleration time of the E wave increased; the left ventricular isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) decreased significantly (88.7?±?6.7, 75.6?±?7.7, 71.1?±?5.0 msec, P?<?0.001) showing a correlation with left atrial dimensions and RI (r?=??0.38, r?=?0.47, P?<?0.001). In the third trimester the comparison between normal and hypertensive women showed a significant reduction in (TVR) total vascular resistances (1006?±?212 vs. 1620?±?469, P?=?0.000) and IVRT (71?±?5.0 vs. 92.0?±?7.6 msec, P?=?0.000). Regression analysis showed a linear correlation between IVRT and TVR (r?=?0.68; P?<?0.01), Uterine RI and TVR were directly related (r?=?0.59, P?<?0.001). Conclusions Maternal diastolic function analysis may be useful to identify women who fully adapt to pregnancy and at risk for development of gestational hypertension.

AB  - Background The aim of the study was to examine the impact of three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound (3D-PDU) in fetal abnormalities involving the vascular system. Method Eighty seven selected pregnancies were included in the study. ATL HDI-3000 and 5000 ultrasound equipment with integrated 3D-Color Power Angio ? software were used. Data acquisition was done by the free-hand-technique and images were reconstructed online. Results Reconstruction was only possible in 56 out of the 87 (64%) considered pregnancies. These were abnormalities of placenta and umbilical vessels (n?=?26), intra-abdominal and intrathoracal anomalies (n?=?12), renal malformations (n?=?9), central nervous system (n?=?4) as well as cardiac defects (n?=?5). The main reasons for failure were fetal position and movements, overlapping with signals from neighboring vessels as well as the reduced attempts in 3D in an on-line system. Details and figures of the potential field of interest in prenatal diagnosis are presented. Conclusions The study shows that 3D-power Doppler can be applied in prenatal diagnosis. The method enables the visualization of main parts of the fetal vascular system under abnormal conditions with the exception of the fetal heart where a trigger system is still needed.

AB  - Background Intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) of a selectively growth-retarded (IUGR) monochorionic (MC) twin is associated with high morbidity/mortality in the appropriately grown (AGA) twin. Selective laser photocoagulation (SLPCV) allows precise separation of the circulations of both twins. The aim of this study was to assess SLPCV in the treatment of MC-IUGR. Methods Patients with previable MC-IUGR were offered SLPCV. Absent or reverse end-diastolic velocity in the umbilical artery of the IUGR twin was also required for entry. Communicating vessels were identified endoscopically as deep artery-to-vein or superficial artery-to-artery or vein-to-vein as previously described. The communications were photocoagulated with Nd:YAG laser. Results SLPCV was performed in 11 patients (GA mean = 20.9?weeks). Survival of both fetuses was n?=?5 (45%), IUFD of the IUGR twin alone was n?=?4 (36%) and IUFD of the AGA twin alone was n?=?2 (18%). There were no dual losses, or adverse effects of an IUFD on the surviving twin. Previously undescribed superficial artery-to-vein anastomosis occurred in three patients. Conclusions SLPCV can effectively create a ?functionally dichorionic? placenta. SLPCV allows the AGA twin to avoid the adverse effects associated with IUFD of the IUGR twin. Unexpected IUFD of the AGA twin may reflect more complex placentation. A new type of vascular communication, superficial artery-to-vein, may have important pathophysiologic implications.

AB  - Aim To investigate the value of 3D-ultrasound in predicting fetal weight at delivery. Patients and methods The study group consisted of 251 pregnant women (formula-finding group: n?=?125; evaluation group: n?=?126) with a singleton pregnancy and an ultrasound examination within seven days of delivery. Pregnancies with major structural or chromosomal anomalies were excluded. Ultrasound examinations included standard biometry as well as three-dimensional volumetry of the upper arm, the thigh and the abdomen of the fetus. All examinations were performed with a Voluson 530D MT system (Kretztechnik, Zipf, Austria). The results were compared with commonly used weight formulas. Results All measurements were completed successfully. Polynomial regression analysis with standard biometric parameters and volumes of the upper arm, the thigh and the abdomen was employed to yield the best-fit formula for prediction of fetal weight at birth. The new 3D formula (Estimated fetal weight (EFW)?=?? 1478.557?+?7.242 * thigh volume +?13.309 * upper arm volume +?852.998 * lg abdominal volume +?0.526 * BIP3) proved to be superior to established two-dimensional equations with the lowest mean error (25.8?±?194.4 g), the lowest mean absolute error (155.2?±?118.2 g) and the lowest mean absolute percentage error (6.1?±?5.0%) when studied prospectively in the evaluation group. Conclusion Fetal weight estimation by 3D?ultrasound compares favourably with conventional 2D?formulas.

AB  - Objectives To determine the value of Doppler flow velocity waveforms from the fetal arterial pulmonary branches relative to fetal biometric indices and clinical correlates in the prenatal prediction of lethal lung hypoplasia (LH) in prolonged oligohydramnios. Study design 42 singleton pregnancies with oligohydramnios associated with premature rupture of membranes (PROM, n?=?31) or bilateral renal pathology (n?=?11) were examined using a combined color coded Doppler and 2d real-time ultrasound system. Thoracic (TC), cardiac (CC) and abdominal circumference (AC) and the largest vertical amniotic fluid pocket were measured. Pulsed Doppler measurements of the arterial pulmonary branches were made at the level of the cardiac four-chamber view after visualization with color Doppler. Diagnosis of LH was based on pathological, clinical and radiological criteria. Results The prevalence of lethal LH was 43%. In the PROM-subset, combination of onset of PROM = 20?weeks; duration of oligohydramnios = 8?weeks and degree of oligohydramnios = 1?cm, presented the highest clinical prediction rate for lethal LH. For both the total group and the PROM-subset, the highest prediction rate for lethal LH from biometric and Doppler parameters was presented by TC/AC ratio, peak systolic velocity in the proximal branch and time-averaged and end-diastolic velocity in the middle branch of the pulmonary artery. In the prom subset, combination of all three clinical, biometric and Doppler parameters revealed the most favorable combination to predict lethal LH (PPV 100%, accuracy 93%, and sensitivity 71%). Conclusion Doppler velocimetry may detect changes in blood velocity waveforms from the arterial branches of the fetal pulmonary circulation in the presence of LH, but fails to be the ultimate test for the prenatal prediction of lethal LH. The best prediction can be achieved by combining clinical, biometric and Doppler parameters.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes the pathophysiology, history and signalment, physical examination, diagnostic findings, treatment and prognosis of vascular disorders in canine and feline patients. Systemic diseases that result in stasis of blood flow, hypercoagulability, and disruption of the endothelial layer in the vasculature can result in the secondary complication of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). PTE affects any age or breed of animal, because it is secondary to underlying disease processes which affect animals of different signalments. Development of PTE is associated with a guarded prognosis, and mortality is high. Because of poor success in the treatment of PTE, prophylactic anticoagulant therapy should be considered in animals with diseases that have been shown to predispose to the condition. Dogs with severe infections develop hemoptysis and signs of right-sided heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or pulmonary embolization, including respiratory distress, abdominal distention, and syncope.
