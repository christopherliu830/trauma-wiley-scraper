AB  - Summary This chapter presents a case study of a 78-year-old woman who was brought to the emergency department (ED) by emergency medical service (EMS) with a chief complaint of a fall resulting in right wrist pain. The functional status of geriatric patients is dependent on multiple aspects of the individual patient, including things such as medical, physical, cognitive, and environmental issues. Functional decline as measured by various ADLs is an important factor in precipitating many ED visits as well, particularly those mobility related activities of daily living (ADLs). Direct observation of functional capabilities via performance testing of gait, gait speed, strength, and balance capabilities is the best method to assess such function, as both patients and physicians are poor predictors of functional limitations. Incorporating functional assessment into the multidisciplinary team approach such as that proposed by the new geriatric emergency department guidelines may help improve outcomes and prevent future adverse events.

AB  - Abstract Objective Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) encompasses unstable angina (UA), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and ST segment myocardial infarction (STEMI). In 2007?2008 in Australia, there were 95?000 hospitalisations for ACS. There is limited data about the level of agreement between the ED and hospital discharge diagnosis. The objective of the present study is to describe the proportion of ED patients with a concordant ACS hospital discharge diagnosis and determine factors associated with this. Methods The present study was a retrospective case series of consecutive presentations of patients with ACS to the EDs of Southern Health, Victoria, Australia, during a 6 month period between August 2011 and January 2012. Results One thousand and twenty-eight patients diagnosed with ACS in the ED were identified. Hospital discharge diagnosis was recorded for 704 cases. The mean age was 63 years (SD 14.5) and 69% were male. One hundred and nineteen patients (16.9%) were diagnosed with a STEMI, 322 (45.7%) with a NSTEMI and 263 (37.4%) with UA. There were 68.3% who had a concordant discharge diagnosis of ACS. An ED diagnosis of STEMI (87.4), English as the primary language (OR 1.81 [1.13?2.89]) and chest pain as the presenting complaint (OR 2.70 [1.72?4.23]) were associated with a concordant diagnosis of ACS. Conclusion Almost one-third of patients who are admitted to the hospital with ACS have a different hospital discharge diagnosis. English as a primary language and presenting with chest pain are associated with a more concordant diagnosis. More research needs to be performed to better understand these findings.

AB  - Abstract Adolescents are experimenting with recreational drugs on a regular basis, particularly at social gatherings such as parties, raves and mass events. A combination of reduced fluid intake, physical activity and drug-induced hyperthermia leads to complications such as heat stroke, delirium and potentially death. The clinician needs to be aware of the variety of pharmacologically active substances available in the recreational marketplace in order to diagnose and manage these patients. Recreational misadventure, because of incorrect dosage or mixing multiple substances, is a common reason for teenagers presenting to hospital with toxidromes. Death from club drug overdose is more likely to be associated with suicidal intent, related risky behaviour and trauma, as well as the inherent toxicity of the drug itself. Although many teenagers are concerned about ?drink spiking? with club drugs, the most common agent causing drink spiking incidents is ethanol.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the arrhythmias, acute coronary syndromes, and hypertensive emergencies. Takotsubo's syndrome or broken heart syndrome is a transient cardiomyopathy that causes significant cardiac depression and closely resembles acute coronary syndromes. Patients typically present with respiratory failure after a significant upper airway problem with EKG changes including ST segment elevation and T wave inversion, and mildly elevated cardiac enzymes. According to recent guidelines, in patients with acute coronary syndrome treated with bare metal or drug eluting stent implantation, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor should be continued for at least 12 months. Elective noncardiac surgeries should be delayed in order to complete a full year of DAPT. Betablockers are drugs of choice for patients with long QT syndrome, which is the most common type of inherited arrhythmia.

AB  - Introduction: Antibiotic resistance develops in human patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with increased duration of stay. The major selection factor is the use of antimicrobial agents. The hypothesis tested in this study was that antimicrobial resistance in fecal E. coli isolated from dogs increased with increased length of stay in the ICU. Methods: E. coli were isolated from rectal swabs collected on days 0 (D0, day of admission to the ICU), 3 (D3), 6 (D6), and 9 (D9) from all dogs housed in the ICU for 3 or more days. The E. coli were tested for resistance to nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Thirty-two patients were included in the study, 17 with D0-D3 and 15 with D0-D6 E. coli isolates. Five E. coli strains were isolated each sampling day and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, resulting in a total of 60 outcomes per day per dog. The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) was calculated for each day up to D6. Univariate ANOVA analysis was used to analyze the data. Results: The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) increased from 9.3% on D0 to 14.7% on D3 to 27.9% on D6. Resistance to the frequently used ampicillin increased in a linear manner with increased duration of stay. The proportion of ampicillin-resistant colonies increased from 19.6% on D0 to 39.1% on D3 to 68.7% on D6 (p=0.001). Resistance to the infrequently used amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, also increased significantly (p=0.026) and linearly. The increase in resistance to enrofloxacin was significant (p=0.046); but the increase in resistance to the precursor, nalidixic acid, was highly significant (p=0.020). No change in resistance to gentamicin was found. The remaining antibiotics tested showed an insignificant increase in resistance. Conclusions: Resistance to antibiotics increased in dogs with duration of stay in the ICU for 3 or more days. This linear trend was most significant with penicillin-based beta-lactams, which are frequently used in the ICU. Consequently, critically ill dogs may be at increased risk for developing opportunistic infections, caused by multi-drug resistant organisms.

AB  - Abstract Objective: Access block (AB) and hospital overcrowding adversely affect ED functionality. ED throughput measures have been described in the literature with positive impacts on key performance indicators (KPIs) ? time to first seen, did-not-wait rates, off-stretcher times for ambulances and ED length of stay figures. In this study, we aimed to assess the impact of a new model of care, the Senior Streaming Assessment Further Evaluation after Triage (SAFE-T) zone concept on ED performance indicators and statistical outcomes. Methods: We implemented a model of care at our tertiary hospital ED amalgamating multiple ED throughput interventions. These interventions included dynamic transition waiting room concept, early senior ED physician assessment and decision-making, early streaming, acute-care bed quarantining and ED short stay and observation units. The principal intervention was the SAFE-T zone. End-point data were compared for similar periods (77?days) of 2010 and 2011 with and without the new model of care. Results: In total, 11?408 and 11?845 patients were included in the study periods pre- and post-intervention, respectively. Time to physician KPI improved from 72.5% to 84.1%. Did-not-wait rates dropped from 10.7% to 9.6% (P= 0.02) and off-stretcher times for ambulances KPI improved from 74.5% to 79.5% (P < 0.001). ED length of stay dropped most significantly for Australasian Triage Scale categories 3 and 4 (14.3% and 11.8%, P-values <0.001). These results were achieved despite worsened AB and hospital bed-occupancy rates during the intervention period (+3.9% and +6.7%). Conclusions: The SAFE-T zone model of care involving multiple ED throughput measures achieved improvements in ED performance despite AB and hospital overcrowding.

AB  - Hospital acquired infections (HAI) are a major source of morbidity and mortality in human and veterinary hospitals. Research in human hospitals has shown that well focused staff education is an important step in limiting the development of HAI. Our hospital currently has no training program with respect to HAI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the general knowledge of hospital staff concerning HAI as the first step in developing a hospital wide education program. Ninety doctors and technicians were given a questionnaire containing 15 questions about HAI. The questionnaires were hand distributed and immediately completed. Ten of the questions tested knowledge of HAI, while five questions concerned the individual's perception of HAI in our hospital. Answers were given as a range from strongly agree to strongly disagree or in the form of multiple choice. With respect to their perception of HAI, 66% of technicians and 50% of doctors believed that they possess a good working knowledge of HAI. Several areas for improvement in hospital staff knowledge were identified. Technicians were more likely than doctors to incorrectly believe that 1) routine environmental cultures are effective at preventing HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 30%, doctors 52%), 2) that all animals that aspirated gastric contents under anesthesia develop clinical evidence of pneumonia (percent correct answer: technicians 55%, doctors 84%), and 3) that animals with an indwelling urinary catheter should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics (percent correct answer: technicians 51%, doctors 90%). In addition, doctors were more likely to identify Amikacin as the antibiotic of choice for patients with HAI in our hospital (percent correct answer: technicians 27%, doctors 79%). Neither group was able to adequately identify the patients in the ICU as the primary reservoir for the multi-drug resistant pathogens that cause HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 20%, doctors 15%). The discrepancy in knowledge between the two groups is likely explained by attendance of faculty, residents, and interns at one or more continuing education rounds sessions where HAI were discussed. This finding is contrary to what is frequently found in human hospitals where the nursing staff typically demonstrates superior knowledge of HAI when compared to doctors. The results of this study demonstrate that knowledge of HAI is not optimal in both the doctors and technicians in our hospital. Further better focused efforts are warranted to address the educational shortcomings evidenced by this study.

AB  - Abstract Although traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major health problem, with approximately 2 million incidents occurring annually in the United States, no therapeutic agents to treat TBI have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration despite several clinical trials. It is estimated that 3.5 million Americans now have a lifelong condition that might be termed ?chronic traumatic brain injury disease.? Some health care providers categorize TBI as an ?event? for which patients require brief periods of rehabilitation with no further treatment. On the contrary, TBI should be seen as a chronic disease process that fits the World Health Organization definition as being a non-reversible pathologic condition requiring special rehabilitation training. Among the major obstacles that contribute to this type of misconception is the absence of brain injury?specific diagnostic biomarker(s) that can indicate and monitor the long-term health status of patients with TBI after use of conventional therapeutics and a rehabilitation process. It is of interest that recent advances in genomics, proteomics, and systems biology have enabled us to use these high throughput?based approaches in developing biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the area of TBI. One aim of this article is to provide an overview that evaluates the current status of TBI biomarker discovery using neuroproteomics/systems biology techniques, along with their clinical utilization. In addition, we discuss the need for strengthening the role of biomarker-based neuroproteomics/systems biology and its potential utility in the field of rehabilitation, which would lead to the establishment of rehabilomics studies, where biomarkers would indicate and predict the long-term efficacy and health status of patients with chronic TBI conditions.

AB  - Abstract A 5·5-year-old male castrated Bernese mountain dog presented with respiratory difficulties and was diagnosed with haemorrhagic pericardial effusion which transformed into chylopericardium. Thoracic duct ligation and subtotal pericardiectomy in combination with biopsy of an enlarged tracheobronchial lymph node were performed. Multiple clusters of mesothelial cell emboli were observed in the subcapsular sinus of the lymph node. No causative agent for the pericardial effusion could be identified, suggesting that this is a case of mesothelial cell embolisation associated with idiopathic -chylopericardium in a dog.

AB  - Introduction? Traumatic tricuspid regurgitation secondary to blunt chest trauma has been reported in literature. We report our experience with a case of ?Torrential Tricuspid Regurgitation? following permanent pacemaker lead extraction which was successfully treated with tricuspid valve repair and annuloplasty. Report? A 67 year old woman was treated for Sick sinus syndrome with permanent pacemaker implant. She had three generator changes for end of life and repositioning.Erosion of generator, led cardiologist to plan lead and generator extraction with the surgical backup. During lead extraction a small piece of papillary muscle was avulsed. The patient remained hemodynamically stable in the theatre. However in ward she developed right sided cardiac failure not responding to conservative therapy. A transthoracic echo (TTE) revealed torrential tricuspid regurgitation with a freely mobile posterior leaflet with attached chordae and avulsed papillary muscle.During surgery the tricuspid valve was successfully repaired and transesophageal (TOE) images showed trivial to mild tricuspid regurgitation at the end of repair procedure. Additional procedure also included ligation of both atrial appendages and implantation of epicardial leads and pacemaker. Patient made good recovery from operation. Conclusion? To the best of our knowledge this is first report of repair of tricuspid valve in ?Torrential Tricuspid Regurgitation? following pacemaker lead extraction. We share our experience with tricuspid valve repair technique and annuloplasty.
