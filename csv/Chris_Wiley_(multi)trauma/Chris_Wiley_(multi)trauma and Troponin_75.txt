AB  - Summary Young and mature adults living with CHD often regard themselves as normal persons that happen to have had a heart problem in the past. They frequently are followed by a pediatric cardiologist, who, for a variety of reasons, both patient and system related, has not transitioned their care to an adult cardiologist and a network of adult consultants. The number of adults living with congenital heart disease has exceeded the number of children living with congenital heart disease for over a decade, and the ratio continues to rise in favour of adult populations. Where and how to deliver services to this group of patients is a challenge for pediatric and adult institutions. The number of adults living past 18 years will mandate that many non-cardiac procedures will not occur in specialized tertiary care centers. Patients will explore care in their immediate community for convenience, occasional necessity and in the case of US patients, insurance. Cardiac anesthesiologists with competencies in congenital cardiac anesthesia will provide anesthetic and ICU care for these patients in cardiac surgery however they will also participate and advise colleagues in the management of their non-cardiac surgery. The challenges for the next decade are the increasing complexity of these patients and the organization of their care for elective, urgent, and emergent non-cardiac procedures.

AB  - Most indications for performing echocardiography focus on the evaluation of properties intrinsic to the heart. However, numerous extra-cardiac conditions indirectly convey changes to the echocardiographic appearance through alterations in the governing physiology. Pulmonary embolism increases pulmonary arterial pressure if a sufficient cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed is occluded. This may result in dilatation of the right ventricle and, in severe cases, concomitant early diastolic septal collapse into the left ventricle. Acute respiratory failure has been shown to yield a similar echocardiographic appearance in experimental conditions due to the resultant pulmonary vasoconstriction. Echocardiography in the presence of pulmonary disease can reveal underlying cardiac pathologies such as pulmonary hypertension that contribute to the clinical severity of respiratory distress. Positive pressure ventilation affects preload, afterload, and compliance of both ventricles. The echocardiographic net result cannot be uniformly anticipated, but provides information on the deciding physiology or pathophysiology. Mediastinal pathology including tumors, herniation of abdominal content, and pleural effusion can often be visualized directly with echocardiography. Mediastinal pathologies adjacent to the heart may compress the myocardium directly, thus facilitating echocardiographic and clinical signs of tamponade in the absence of pericardial effusion. In conclusion, many pathologies of extra-cardiac origin influence the echocardiographic appearance of the heart. These changes do not reflect properties of the myocardium but may well be mistaken for it. Hence, these conditions are essential knowledge to all physicians performing echocardiography across the spectrum from advanced cardiological diagnostics to rapid point-of-care focused cardiac ultrasonography.

AB  - Summary Although reduced natural killer (NK) cell levels have been reported consistently in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), the clinical significance and persistence of this immune perturbation is not clarified. In this study we characterized the NK cell deficit further by determining (i) differentiation surface markers and cytokine profile of NK cell subsets and (ii) ability to reconstitute NK cell levels over time. Flow cytometry was used to analyse NK cell subsets and the intracellular cytokine profile in 31 patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI), 34 patients with stable angina (SA) and 37 healthy controls. In blood collected prior to coronary angiography, the proportions of NK cells were reduced significantly in non-STEMI and SA patients compared with controls, whereas NK cell subset analyses or cytokine profile measurements did not reveal any differences across groups. During a 12-month follow-up, the proportions of NK cells increased, although not in all patients. Failure to reconstitute NK cell levels was associated with several components of metabolic syndrome. Moreover, interleukin (IL)-6 levels remained high in patients with sustained NK cell deficit, whereas a decline in IL-6 (P?<?0·001) was seen in patients with a pronounced increase in NK cells. In conclusion, we found no evidence that reduction of NK cells in CAD patients was associated with aberrations in NK cell phenotype at any clinical stage of the disease. Conversely, failure to reconstitute NK cell levels was associated with a persistent low-grade inflammation, suggesting a protective role of NK cells in CAD.
