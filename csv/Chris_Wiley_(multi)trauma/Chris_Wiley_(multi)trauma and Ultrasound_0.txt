AB  - Summary Many patients come to the emergency department with complaints of visual change or loss, ocular trauma, eye pain or other conditions that necessitate an accurate assessment of the eye and/or orbit. Ultrasound has been used by ophthalmologists for several decades. As multi-purpose, high-frequency probes are now available for many of the portable ultrasound machines found in emergency departments, emergency physicians take advantage of these diagnostic capabilities and perform bedside ultrasound ocular examinations as their scope of practice. Vitreous haemorrhage can occur secondary to diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, trauma, retinal vein occlusion or retinal tears. Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) can occur as a result of normal aging, trauma, vitreous haemorrhage or inflammation. In chronic PVD, the vitreous may become more stiff and dense and may resemble retinal detachment. Differentiation may be difficult and may depend on ophthalmology consultation.

AB  - Summary Pre-hospital care (PHC) is organised differently across the globe and consists of: primary work or retrieval work. Doctors bring with them a set of advanced skills which may be used to benefit a small cohort of the sickest patients. One such skill is ultrasound (US). This chapter focuses primarily on the primary retrieval role. The role of US in PHC is two-fold: to promote earlier, more accurate diagnoses, so enhancing patient care; and to minimise the risks of procedures. The management of many medical emergencies and traumatic injuries is influenced by early care delivery. The major potential for harm from PHC US is that of increased on-scene time delaying transport to definitive care. PHC US has been shown to alter the disposition or management of trauma patients, and performs better than clinical assessment alone. US studies performed in the pre-hospital arena may be truncated once diagnostic information has been obtained.

AB  - Summary Point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) has a number of indications in paediatric musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions, and provides many advantages over traditional imaging and diagnostic techniques. This chapter attention focusses on PoCUS and its application to more acute presentations, including infectious, inflammatory and traumatic conditions. In terms of examiner technique, adequate ultrasound gel, appropriate probe manipulation, probe stabilisation using the hypothenar eminence and little finger of the examiner's hand, as well as multi-angle views to evaluate for anisotropy, are all important to obtaining high-quality clinically useful ultrasound images. PoCUS can be useful in the diagnosis, evaluation and also often the treatment of paediatric skin and soft-tissue infections. Common entities evaluated are cellulitis, abscess and acute haematogenous osteomyelitis. Retained foreign bodies (FBs), dislocation/subluxation in children, ligament, tendon injuries, and joint effusions are also discussed. A high-frequency (7-12?MHz) probe with paediatric hip/MSK preset should be used if available.

AB  - Abstract Time-out protocols have reportedly improved team dynamics and patients? safety in various clinical settings ? particularly in the operating room. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced a Trauma Care checklist, which outlines steps to follow immediately after the primary and secondary surveys and prior to the team leaving the patient. The WHO Trauma Care checklist's main perceived benefit is the prompting of clinicians to complete trauma admissions as per evidence-based guidelines. The WHO Trauma Care checklist, while likely to be successful in reducing errors of omission related to hospital admission, may be limited in its ability to reduce errors that occur in the initial 30 min of trauma reception ? when most of the life-saving decisions are made. To address this limitation a Trauma Team Time-out protocol is proposed for initial trauma resuscitation, targeting the critical first 30 min of hospital reception.

AB  - Abstract Objectives A multidisciplinary approach that emphasised improved triage, early pelvic binder application, early administration of blood and blood products, adherence to algorithmic pathways, screening with focused sonography (FAST), early computed tomography scanning with contrast angiography, angio-embolisation and early operative intervention by specialist pelvic surgeons was implemented in the last decade to improve outcomes after pelvic trauma. The manuscript evaluated the effect of this multi-faceted change over a 12-year period. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted comparing patients presenting with serious pelvic injury in 2002 to those presenting in 2013. The primary exposure and comparator variables were the year of presentation and the primary outcome variable was mortality at hospital discharge. Potential confounders were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results There were 1213 patients with a serious pelvic injury (Abbreviated Injury Scale?≥3), increasing from 51 in 2002 to 156 in 2013. Demographics, injury severity and presenting clinical characteristics were similar between the two time periods. There was a statistically significant difference in mortality from 20% in 2002 to 7.7% in 2013 (P?=?0.02). The association between the primary exposure variable of being injured in 2013 and mortality remained statistically significant (adjusted odds ratio 0.10; 95% confidence interval: 0.02?0.60) when adjusted for potential clinically important confounders. Conclusions Multi-faceted interventions directed at the spectrum of trauma resuscitation from pre-hospital care to definitive surgical management were associated with significant reduction in mortality of patients with severe pelvic injury from 2002 to 2013. This demonstrates the effectiveness of an integrated, inclusive trauma system in achieving improved outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Background Functional recovery is an important outcome for those who survive critical illness. The present study aimed to assess nutrition provision and nutrition-related outcomes in a multi-trauma cohort following intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. Methods The present study investigated a prospective cohort of patients discharged from an ICU, who had been admitted because of major trauma and required mechanical ventilation for at least 48 h. Nutrition-related outcomes, including body weight, quadriceps muscle layer thickness (QMLT), handgrip strength and subjective global assessment, were recorded on ICU discharge, days 5?7 post-ICU discharge and then weekly until hospital discharge. Nutrition intake was recorded for 5 days post-ICU discharge. Unless otherwise stated, data are presented as the mean (SD). Results Twenty-eight patients [75% males, 55 (22.5) years] were included. Intake met 64% (28%) of estimated energy and 72% (32%) of protein requirements over the 5 days post-ICU discharge, which was similar to over the ICU admission. From ICU admission to hospital discharge, the mean reduction in weight was 4.2 kg (95% confidence interval = 2.2?6.3, P < 0.001) and after ICU discharge, the mean reduction in weight and QMLT was 2.6 kg (95% confidence interval = 1.0?4.2, P = 0.004) and 0.23 cm (95% confidence interval = 0.06?0.4, P = 0.01), respectively. Conclusions Patients received less energy and protein than estimated requirements after ICU discharge. Weight loss and reduction in QMLT also occurred during this period.

AB  - Summary Traumatic injuries to the musculoskeletal system are extremely common. These injuries are among the short list of medical disorders that may be completely resolved if recognized and appropriately treated. Radiologists have an important role in the diagnosis. In order to identify the abnormality and characterize it correctly, it is essential to be familiar with normal anatomy, protocols for imaging tests, patterns of injury, and implement an organized approach to image interpretation. The American College of Radiology (ACR) devised guidelines for selecting the appropriate imaging test in a patient who sustained musculoskeletal trauma. This chapter deals with different imaging tests, including radiographs, Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, bone scintigraphy and ultrasound. The radiology report needs to be concise, yet include relevant information required for effective clinical management. It is important to be familiar with common fracture classification systems and understand how different grades of injury potentially affect treatment.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: The aim of this study was to clinically detect the immediate effect of root instrumentation with curettes and ultrasonic scalers on clinical attachment level. Material and Methods: Twelve subjects with moderate chronic periodontitis, presenting probing depths of 3.5?6.5?mm on anterior teeth, upper and/or lower, were selected. Teeth were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: US group ? scaled with an ultrasonic scaler; and CC group ? scaled and planed with 5?6 Gracey curettes. The selected teeth were probed with a computerized electronic probe, guided by an occlusal stent and subjected to scaling and root planing. Immediately following instrumentation, teeth were probed again. The difference between relative attachment level (RAL) immediately before and after instrumentation was considered trauma from instrumentation. Results: Intra-group analysis revealed statistically significant differences between RAL immediately before and after instrumentation in both groups (0.77±0.51 for US group; and 0.73±0.41 for CC group, p<0.0001). However, inter-group analysis did not show statistically significant difference in trauma from instrumentation caused by the two different instruments (p=0.816). Conclusions: Within the limits of this study, it was concluded that root instrumentation causes a mean immediate attachment loss of 0.75?mm, and that instrumentation with either curettes or ultrasonic scalers do not seem to reduce significantly the trauma from of instrumentation produced.

AB  - Abstract The demand for ultrasound guided injections for musculoskeletal presentations has increased in recent years as practitioners and patients seek verification of needle position. Musculoskeletal management pathways regularly include injection therapy for pain relief and are sometimes indicated as a single intervention but may need to be supported by rehabilitation. Workload in radiology departments has expanded in volume and complexity as radiologists perform new interventional procedures that require medical expertise. Innovative responses are required to meet the demand for ultrasound guided musculoskeletal injections; one option is offering appropriate education to musculoskeletal sonographers, enabling them to extend their current scope of practice. The role of the extended scope physiotherapist in the United Kingdom provides evidence that role diversification can produce excellent patient outcomes whilst preserving financial resources. The professional, legal and clinical requirements of extending service provision to include new clinical staff presents challenges that have to be met with strong leadership and the provision of high quality education in ultrasound guided interventions. There are many indicators that the patient experience is enhanced by guiding musculoskeletal injections, and access to this service has impact on patients' confidence in their treatment pathway.

AB  - ABSTRACT. Purpose:? To establish the diagnostic role of imaging by ultrasound for the diagnosis of uveal effusion syndrome. Methods:? Using ultrasonic imaging features as the main criteria for evaluation, the recorded data from 16 patients with presumed uveal effusion seen between 1994 and 2000 were reviewed and analysed for clinical manifestations and current diagnostic suggestions. Eventually, as cumulating experience suggested that ultrasound is capable of indicating uveal effusion, the study set-up became in part more prospective. Results:? The two main ultrasonic features found were: (1) extended multi-layered detachment patterns by B-scan, often kinetically mobile; (2) a spongy oedematous ciliary body region, often with interstitial lacunae, as demonstrated by high-resolution ultrasound biomicroscopy (50 Mhz). Conclusions:? In patients with visual loss and ambiguous detachment-like fundus pathology, ultrasonic features are often of practical guidance for diagnosing uveal effusion syndrome.

AB  - Objectives Point-of-care ultrasound is a valuable tool with potential to expedite diagnoses and improve patient outcomes in the emergency department. However, little is known about national patterns of adoption. This study examined nationwide point-of-care ultrasound reimbursement among emergency medicine (EM) practitioners and examined regional and practitioner level variations. Methods Data from the 2012 Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Fee-for-Service Provider Utilization and Payment Data include all practitioners who received more than 10 Medicare Part B fee-for-service reimbursements for any Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System code in 2012. Odds ratios (ORs) and descriptive statistics were calculated to assess relationships between ultrasound reimbursement and practice location, nearby presence of an EM residency, and time elapsed since practitioner graduation. Results Of 52,928 unique EM practitioners, 391 (0.7%) received limited ultrasound reimbursements for a total of 16,389 scans in 2012. Urban counties had an OR of 5.4 (95% confidence interval, 3.8?7.8) for receiving point-of-care ultrasound reimbursements compared to rural counties. Counties with an EM residency had an OR of 84.7 (95% confidence interval, 42.6?178.8) for reimbursement compared to counties without. The OR for receiving reimbursement was independent of medical school graduation year (P = .83); however, recent graduates performed more scans (P = .02). Conclusions A small minority of EM practitioners received reimbursements for point-of-care ultrasound from Medicare beneficiaries. These practitioners were more likely to reside in urban and academic settings. Future efforts should assess the degree to which our findings reflect either low point-of-care ultrasound use or low rates of billing for ultrasound examinations that are performed.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the diagnostic imaging, ultrasound, and interventional radiology. Patients with flow-limiting intimal defects should be explored. Posterior knee dislocation is associated with popliteal arterial injuries. These patients should undergo diagnostic imaging to rule out popliteal artery injury. Good diagnostic quality computed tomography (CT) angiographic extremity examinations require careful patient preparation, to give images that will provide the necessary information. The use of abdominal ultrasound for detecting the need for operative intervention in a patient who has sustained a penetrating trauma to the abdomen carries a low sensitivity and a high specificity. A normal ultrasound examination of the thoracic cavity demonstrates the rib, the sliding of the pleura, and the presence of a comet tail artifact. Sternal fracture is a diagnosis that can be made using ultrasound, and some reports suggest that ultrasound is more sensitive and specific for this injury than plain radiology.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Sonographers of a large, metropolitan health service were trained and credentialed in extended focussed assessment by sonography in trauma in preparation for a potential mass casualty incident. Given the prior ultrasound experience of this cohort, the suitability of an abbreviated credentialing pathway based upon that required for emergency physicians was evaluated. Method A training and credentialing process to teach extended focussed assessment by sonography in trauma was planned for sonographers. The model was based upon existing credentialing requirements for emergency physicians. The project was undertaken in two stages, using a ?train the trainer? approach. The initial stage trained and credentialed a group of senior sonographer trainers. This group then supported the training and credentialing of the wider sonographer cohort. Results Twenty-eight qualified sonographers were successfully trained and credentialed in extended focussed assessment by sonography in trauma scanning. Practical competency assessment demonstrated 100% (28/28) pass rate. Image interpretation assessment results also demonstrated 100% (28/28) pass rate. Conclusion An abbreviated model is suitable for the training and credentialing of sonographers in extended focussed assessment by sonography in trauma, given their pre-existing ultrasound skills and knowledge.

AB  - Summary Focussed resuscitation and peri-resuscitation echocardiography is a relatively new and evolving application of point-of-care sonology that may significantly benefit those patients who have reversible causes of cardiac arrest. This chapter focusses on the advanced cardiac life support (ACLS)-compliant use of sonography in cardiac arrest or pulseless states. Echocardiography in the peri-resuscitation setting may distinguish between two forms of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) with very different prognoses: If PEA with cardiac activity is identified, ultrasound can be extremely effective in identifying many of the more common reversible causes. The Focussed Echocardiography Examination in Life (FEEL) support examination offers an ACLS-compliant approach to the use of ultrasonography in cardiac arrest. In the workflow of the FEEL examination, sonographic images are obtained exclusively during the brief breaks from cardiac compressions for rhythm analysis and pulse check after the initial minimum of 2 minutes of uninterrupted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

AB  - Abstract Objectives To evaluate whether transperineal three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound can be used to depict normal anal sphincter anatomy and to measure the thickness of muscle layers and the anteroposterior length of the levator hiatus. Methods The study included 22 normal nulliparous female volunteers. Transperineal 3D sonographic evaluation of the anal canal included assessment of sphincter shape, echogenicity, marginal definition and muscle thickness. Measurements of the thickness of the internal anal sphincter (IAS) and puborectalis muscle (PRM) were determined with the women at rest and during squeezing by two observers, and interobserver reliability was determined. The anteroposterior length of the levator hiatus at rest and during squeezing was measured. Results The proximal end of the anal canal (towards the rectum) consisted of overlapping IAS and PRM, and the distal end (towards the anus) consisted of overlapping IAS and external anal sphincter (EAS). At the PRM level, the mean ± SD IAS thickness was 2.3 ± 0.5 mm at rest and 2.5 ± 0.4 mm during squeezing, and at the mid-EAS level it was 2.9 ± 0.5 mm at rest and 2.8 ± 0.5 mm during squeezing. The PRM thickness was 6.5 ± 1.0 mm at rest and 6.4 ± 1.2 mm during squeezing. The difference in muscle thickness of the sphincter layers with the woman at rest and during squeezing was not significant. The anteroposterior length of the levator hiatus was 51.7 ± 5.0 mm at rest and 47.4 ± 4.1 mm during squeezing (P < 0.01). Conclusion Transperineal 3D ultrasound may be useful in evaluating the anatomy of the anal canal. Copyright ? 2007 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of the present paper was to evaluate an ultrasound contrast agent (Levovist) in patients with oliguric acute renal failure (ARF) in order to assess renal vascularity, differentiate acute tubular from cortical necrosis and predict prognosis. Ten intensive care unit (ICU) patients with oliguric ARF were prospectively investigated by ultrasound including colour, power and pulsed Doppler before and after injection of Levovist. Doppler signals were graded as absent, equivocal or present from the inner and outer portions of the renal parenchyma, and these findings were correlated with clinical parameters and outcome. Only one patient had findings in keeping with acute cortical necrosis. All patients who survived had parenchymal vascularity while only three of six (50%) who died had parenchymal vascularity after Levovist. The ultrasound contrast caused no side effects and additional information was provided which improved diagnostic confidence, enabled appropriate classification of patients as having tubular or cortical necrosis and therefore added prognostic information.

AB  - Objectives:? High resolution two-dimensional ultrasound (2D US) difficulty in evaluation of some scrotal mass lesions is not frequent. The aim of the present study was to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic performance of three-dimensional ultrasound extended imaging (3D XI) in characterization of those lesions. Methods:? The study protocol had the approval of the University's review board all participants' informed consents were obtained. The study included 28 selected patients (12 testicular and 16 para-testicular mass lesions) examined by 2D US and 3D XI applications including computed multi-slice view (MSV) and multi-resolution enhanced images (XI MR). Results were correlated with histopathological findings. Results:? Two-dimensional ultrasound did not adequately characterize 28 patients out of 329 (8.5%). 3D XI interrogation was an easy procedure and distinctive of the pathological findings in 27 patients out of 28 (96.4%). The performance of XI MR with respect to characterization provided additional diagnostic information over MSV. Conclusions:? The performance of 3D XI with respect to testicular mass characterization proved better than static 2D US. Subsequently, the results of this study suggest that the routine use of 2D US in diagnosis of scrotal mass lesions should preferably be upgraded to 3D XI methods.

AB  - Abstract Objective At present little information is available to help define whether a certain degree of pelvic organ prolapse is clinically relevant. We performed a retrospective study to define cut-offs for significant pelvic organ descent on the basis of prolapse symptoms. Methods At a tertiary urogynecological center, 735 women with symptoms of lower urinary tract dysfunction and prolapse were seen for interview, clinical examination, multi-channel urodynamics and ultrasound imaging, while supine and after voiding, for prolapse quantification. Women with multi-compartment prolapse, i.e. those in whom no compartment was clearly dominant were excluded. Receiver?operator statistics were used to test pelvic organ descent as a predictor of prolapse symptoms. Results Mean age was 55.1 years, mean parity 2.8 (range, 0?12). Symptoms of prolapse were reported by 188 women (25.6%). Seventy-four showed a symptomatic multi-compartment prolapse and were excluded, 56 symptomatic women had cystoceles and 48 had rectoceles. Symptomatic cystoceles descended on average to 23.8 mm below the symphysis pubis and symptomatic rectoceles to 21.4 mm below the symphysis pubis. Descent was strongly associated with symptoms of prolapse (both, P < 0.001). Receiver?operating characteristics (ROC) statistics suggested a cut-off of 10 mm below the symphysis pubis for cystocele, and 15 mm below the symphysis pubis for rectocele. ROC curves were similar for both compartments (area under the curve, 0.857 and 0.821, respectively). Conclusions Descent of the bladder to ≥ 10 mm and of the rectum to ≥ 15 mm below the symphysis pubis are strongly associated with symptoms, and these values are proposed as cut-offs for the diagnosis of significant prolapse on the basis of ROC statistics.
