AB  - Background: Blunt thoracic trauma is a major concern in critically ill patients. Repeated lung diagnostic evaluations are needed in order to follow up the clinical situation and the results of the therapeutic strategies. The aim of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate the possible role of lung ultrasound (LU) compared with bedside radiography (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) used as the gold standard in the evaluation of trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit with acute respiratory failure. Method: A total of 15 thoracic trauma patients were studied at intensive care unit (ICU) arrival (T1) and 48?h later (T2) with CT, CXR and LU. We evaluated the presence of pleural effusion (PE) and lung contusion (LC). For this purpose the lung parenchyma was divided into 12 regions so that we could compare 180 lung regions at T1 and T2, respectively. Results: Sensitivity of ultrasound was 0.94 for PE and 0.86 for LC while specificity 0.99 and 0.97, respectively. The likelihood ratio was 94 (?+) and 0.06 (??) for PE and 28.6 (?+) and 0.14 (??) for LC. Conclusions: Ultrasound provides a reliable noninvasive, bedside method for the assessment of chest trauma patients with acute respiratory failure in the ICU.

AB  - Summary Prehospital ultrasound is an increasingly pertinent area of focus for EMS providers worldwide. Bedside ultrasound application in the hospital has foreseeable benefits when transferred to an out-of-hospital environment, in a multitude of scenarios. Non-physicians have successfully demonstrated the ability to perform focused ultrasound exams. However, educational criteria for non-physician users, standardized competency evaluations, standardized ultrasound-in-the-field algorithms, and outcomes data for prehospital use need to be established. There is a large potential for research and future development of ultrasound within EMS on a global scale.

AB  - Summary Complications during pregnancy are not frequent, but may occur abruptly. Point-of-care ultrasound is a non-invasive, non-ionising diagnostic tool that is available at the bed-side when complications occur. This review covers the use of ultrasound in various clinical situations. Gastric ultrasound can identify stomach contents that put the woman at risk for pulmonary aspiration. In the future, this tool will probably be used routinely before induction of anaesthesia to determine the presence of stomach contents above a particular risk threshold. Difficult tracheal intubation, and the potential for ?can't intubate, can't oxygenate?, is more frequent in pregnant women. Point-of-care ultrasound of the airway allows accurate identification of the cricothyroid membrane, permitting rapid and safer establishment of front-of-neck airway access. Combined cardiac and lung ultrasound can determine the potential risk:benefit of fluid administration in the pregnant patient. Such prediction is of critical importance, given the tendency of pregnant women to develop pulmonary oedema. Combined echocardiography and lung ultrasound can be combined with ultrasound of the leg veins to differentiate between the various causes of acute respiratory failure, and guide treatment in this situation. Finally, as shown in the general population, multi-organ point-of-care ultrasound allows early diagnosis of the main causes of circulatory failure and cardiac arrest at the bed-side. As the importance of point-of-care ultrasound in critical patients is increasingly recognised, it is emerging as an important tool in the therapeutic armoury of obstetric anaesthetists.

AB  - Abstract Background:? The incidence of abdominal stab wounds treated at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Vic., Australia has noticeably increased over the 12?month period to March 2006, mirroring an increase in penetrating abdominal trauma throughout many Australian trauma centres. Management protocols for abdominal stab wounds are still contentious. The current study quantifies the increase in stab wounds at the Royal Melbourne Hospital over a 24?month period and analyses the management modalities used. Methods:? A review of the Trauma Unit of the Royal Melbourne Hospital was performed for the period of 20 March 2004 until 20 March 2006. All anterior abdominal stab wounds were collated for the site of injury, investigations performed on admission, results of investigations, operations performed and findings at operation. Results:? There were 4244 emergency trauma presentations over the 24?month period between 20 March 2004 and 20 March 2006. The second 12?month period showed a 21.5% increase in overall trauma admissions and a 91.3% increase in anterior abdominal stabbings. The percentage of stab wounds treated conservatively fell by 21.8%, with the percentage of laparotomies increasing by 14.2%. Almost 30% of all patients undergoing surgery had no visceral injury at operation. Twenty CT scans were performed preoperatively, with a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 100%. Conclusion:? Abdominal stab wounds treated at Royal Melbourne Hospital have substantially increased over the past 12?months. Although management is still contentious, a management protocol for anterior abdominal stab wounds is proposed, outlining the role of CT scanning, conservative management, laparoscopy and laparotomy.

AB  - In this paper we review the current status of intravascular ultrasound. Data from qualitative and quantitative studies is presented. Our experimental findings and those of other investigators are reviewed. Intravascular ultrasound has been shown to delineate normal and abnormal arterial morphology as well as to identify and differentiate fibrous, lipid-rich, calcified plaques and complicated plaques. Quantitative studies show strong correlations between ultrasound and histology for lumen area, wall thickness, and plaque area. In vivo studies from our experimental work and clinical laboratory as well as the work of other researchers is presented. This data supports the potential of ultrasound imaging for guidance of intravascular intervention. The potential advantages and limitations of this new technology are discussed. This methodology shows promise for the assessment of the extent and severity of atherosclerosis, monitoring its progression and regression and guiding intravascular plaque ablation technologies.

AB  - Objective. To reevaluate the usefulness of ultrasonography for detecting and classifying solid-organ injuries from blunt abdominal trauma by comparing ultrasonography with computed tomography (CT) and laparotomy. Methods. Six hundred four patients with blunt abdominal trauma were examined by both B-mode ultrasonography and CT for a study period of 14 years. The ultrasonographic examiners were divided into 2 groups depending on their experience with ultrasonography. The ultrasonographic results were then compared with CT and surgical findings. This was a retrospective study. Results. In 198 patients, solid-organ injuries were identified on CT, laparotomy, or both. Sensitivity values in group A (experts) were 87.5% for hepatic injuries, 85.4% for splenic injuries, 77.6% for renal injuries, and 44.4% for pancreatic injuries. Sensitivity values in group B were 46.2% for hepatic injuries, 50.0% for splenic injuries, and 44.1% for renal injuries. The detection rates in group A were 80% to 100% for different types of hepatic injuries except superficial injuries (20%) and 70% to 100% for different types of splenic injuries. The detection rates for renal parenchymal and pancreatic duct injuries were 53.3% and 80%, respectively. The detection rates for injuries requiring intervention were 86.1% in group A and 66.7% in group B. Conclusions. The sensitivity of ultrasonography with the use of CT and surgical findings as reference standards decreased compared with our prior study. However, ultrasonography was found to enable experienced examiners to detect and classify parenchymal injuries efficiently, despite disadvantages in detecting superficial and vascular injuries. Ultrasonography should be used to explore not only free fluid but also solid-organ injuries.

AB  - Summary Background In patients suffering from epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica (DEB), the most severe form of epidermolysis bullosa, trauma or friction cause separation of the skin from underlying tissue with consecutive painful blisters, scarifications, contractures, and pseudosyndactyly. To retain functionality of the hands surgical procedures are necessary. Anesthesia is challenging as difficult airways make general anesthesia risky. Regional anesthesia is considered controversial in patients with EB as accidental subcutaneous injections can cause severe blisters. As ultrasound-guided procedures became standard of care this might have changed however. Aim In this case series, we describe feasibility, efficacy, and safety of ultrasound-guided plexus axillaris block in DEB patients undergoing hand surgery. Method We performed a retrospective analysis of the charts of all children with DEB undergoing hand surgery under plexus axillaris block and sedation between 2009 and 2013 in our institution. Results Nineteen procedures in nine children were performed. Induction of anesthesia (securing monitoring, sedation, plexus block) took a mean time of 34 min. Perioperative analgesia was adequate in all procedures. No complications such as airway incidents, conversion to general anesthesia, movement during surgery, incomplete block, or formation of new blisters were seen. Conclusion Ultrasound-guided plexus axillaris block in DEB patients undergoing hand surgery in our institution has been feasible, effective, and safe.

AB  - Objective To describe the technique and findings of the ?veterinary focused assessment with sonography for trauma-airway, breathing, circulation, disability and exposure? protocol in dogs suffering from trauma. Materials and Methods Prospective observational study on a new point-of-care ultrasound protocol on 64 dogs suffering from trauma and comparison of findings with radiology. Results Comparison of the results of this new ultrasound protocol for trauma patients with radiography findings for pneumothorax, pleural effusion, alveolar-interstitial syndrome and abdominal effusion revealed positive agreement of 89, 83, 100 and 87% and negative agreement of 76, 83, 76 and 92%, respectively. Novel findings of the ?veterinary focused assessment with sonography for trauma-airway, breathing, circulation, disability and exposure? exam, which were not previously reported for dogs undergoing focused assessment with sonography for trauma, included alveolar-interstitial syndrome (suggestive of pulmonary contusions), diaphragmatic hernia, retroperitoneal effusion and tracheal injury. Our new technique may also help identify increased intracranial pressure via changes in optic nerve sheath diameter and haemodynamic instability through the evaluation of the caudal vena cava and cardiac function. Clinical Significance The described ultrasound examination protocol can be rapidly performed on dogs suffering from trauma during resuscitation and it may detect injuries previously undetectable using other veterinary point-of-care ultrasound protocols.

AB  - Purpose: The recent clinical emergence of minimally invasive image-guided therapy has demonstrated promise in the management of brain metastasis, although control over the spatial pattern of heating currently remains limited. Based on experience in other organs, the delivery of high-intensity contact ultrasound energy from minimally invasive applicators can enable accurate spatial control of energy deposition, large treatment volumes, and high treatment rate. In this acute study, the feasibility of active MR-Temperature feedback control of dynamic ultrasound heat deposition for interstitial thermal ablation in brain was evaluatedin vivo. Methods: A four-element linear ultrasound transducer (f = 8.2 MHz) originally developed for transurethral ultrasound therapy was used in a porcine model for generating thermal ablations in brain interstitially. First, the feasibility of treating and retreating preciselyin vivo brain tissues using stationary (non-rotating device) ultrasound exposures was studied in two pigs. Experimental results were compared to numerical simulations for maximum surface acoustic intensities ranging from 5 to 20 W cm?2. Second, active MRT feedback-controlled ultrasound treatments were performed in three pigs with a rotating device to coagulate target volumes of various shapes. The acoustic power and rotation rate of the device were adjusted in real-time based on MR-thermometry feedback control to optimize heat deposition at the target boundary. Modeling of in vivo treatments were performed and compared to observed experimental results. Results: Overall, the time-space evolution of the temperature profiles observedin vivo could be well estimated from numerical simulations for both stationary and dynamic interstitial ultrasound exposures. Dynamic exposures performed under closed-loop temperature control enabled accurate elevation of the brain tissues within the targeted region above the 55?°C threshold necessary for the creation of irreversible thermal damage. Treatment volumes ranging from 1 to 9 cm3 were completed within 8 ± 3 min with a radial targeting error <2 mm on average (treatment rate: 0.7 ± 0.5 cm3/min). Tissue changes were visible on T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (T1w-CE) images immediately after treatment. These changes were also evident on T2-weighted (T2w) images acquired 2 h after the 1st treatment and correlated well with the MR-thermometry measurements. Conclusions: These results support the feasibility of active MRT feedback control of dynamic interstitial ultrasound therapy ofin vivo brain tissues and confirm the feasibility of using simulations to predict spatial heating patterns in the brain.

AB  - Abstract Purpose Hemoperitoneum in the hypotensive trauma patient is an indication for emergent laparotomy. Focused assessment sonography in trauma (FAST) is a widely used tool for detecting hemoperitoneum. The usefulness of FAST is currently limited by low sensitivity. We hypothesize rolling patients onto their right side will pool small volumes of fluid into the right upper quadrant of the abdomen leading to increased sensitivity. Methods Peritoneal dialysis patients were recruited for voluntary participation in a small pilot prospective clinical trial. Each participant first underwent a supine FAST followed by a 30-second roll onto the right side. Once back in the supine position, the FAST was repeated (FASTeR or FAST examination after right-sided roll). About 50?mL aliquots of dialysate were sequentially infused into the abdomen and the imaging sequence repeated until a positive finding was obtained. Results Seven patients were consented for the study. One patient was found to have an equivocal examination secondary to renal cysts. All six remaining participants converted to a positive FASTeR at an intra-abdominal fluid volume at which standard FAST was negative. Conclusions Rolling patients to the right side increased FAST sensitivity, converting false-negative to true positives examinations. A larger study is needed to validate our preliminary data.

AB  - Abstract Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death and disabling disease. Whereas risk factors are well known and constitute therapeutic targets, they are not useful for prediction of risk of future myocardial infarction, stroke, or death. Therefore, methods to identify atherosclerosis itself have been tested and found useful (ie, coronary calcium detection by computed tomography scanning, reduction in ankle-brachial index, and ultrasound scanning of the carotid arteries). This review will focus on the latter technique. Detection of thickened carotid intima-media by ultrasound has been used in many large epidemiological studies, but although it has been found to be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death, its clinical utility is limited. Detection of carotid plaque has, on the other hand, been found to be associated with a substantial risk of future events. Similarly, detection of plaque in the femoral arteries is associated with increased risk, and plaque in the femoral as well as carotid arteries predicts even higher risk. Furthermore, quantification of plaque size (plaque area), such as quantification of amount of coronary calcium on computed tomography scanning, improves predictability?the larger the plaques, the higher the risk. So far, studies using ultrasound all have been performed with 2-dimensional ultrasound imaging. Recently, 3-dimensional ultrasound imaging has been introduced, which allows for more accurate quantification of atherosclerosis. Small studies pioneering its use have indicated the utility of measuring changes in vessel-wall volume and plaque volume with respect to treatment effect. The High-Risk Plaque Initiative BioImage Study is currently investigating the predictive value of total carotid plaque volume with respect to prediction of future cardiovascular events.

AB  - Objectives To retrospectively evaluate cases presented for percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis for associated complications, identify risk factors associated with complications and to assess ultrasonographic findings and relate these to bacterial culture results. Methods Data on 300 patients presented for percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis were retrospectively collected and ultrasonographic images were assessed for defined structural changes. The incidence of major complications was determined. Multi-variable multi-level logistic regression was used to investigate the association of ultrasonographic findings with positive bile culture. Results Three hundred percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis procedures performed in 201 dogs and 51 cats were included; 35 patients had the procedure performed more than once. The overall incidence of major complications was 8 of 300 procedures (2·7%). Bile peritonitis occurred in 2 of 300 procedures (0·7%). An ultrasonographically abnormal gall bladder was found in 52% of cases and had a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 82, 55·7 and 61·5% respectively, to predict a positive bile culture. Clinical Significance Percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis is overall a safe technique when carried out in selected patients. Abnormal ultrasonographic findings are only a fair predictor of a positive bile culture.

The objective of our study was to assess the scope, impact, and characteristics of these donation and training activities. Methods We designed a 1-page, 10-question survey soliciting responses on donors, equipment, donation sites, training, and follow-up. Physicians and sonographers with qualifying donation experience were located by means of personal references, professional networking, and referral from US manufacturers. Respondents were also solicited at several online sites for medical imagers. The survey was active from May 2010 to March 2011 and was available via an interactive website (www.surveymonkey.com) or as an electronic download directly from the authors. Results Fifteen respondents provided data on deployments spanning a 7-year period from 2004 to early 2011. Forty-eight compact US units were donated to sites in 15 different nations on 4 continents; 69% of the units went to sites in Africa. All but 4 sites received initial training. Donated systems were reported as ?operational and functional? for all units for which the current status was available. Conclusions Results suggest involvement by a broad variety of participants. The number of successful deployments and excellent equipment durability support the premise that small-scale, individual donation and training activities have the potential for a substantial public health impact. The authors recommend better coordination of effort and the need for additional data.

AB  - Objective To review the guidelines released in the last decade by several organisations for the optimal evaluation and management of genitourinary injuries (renal, ureteric, bladder, urethral and genital). Methods This is a review of the genitourinary trauma guidelines from the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA), and renal trauma guidelines from the Société Internationale d'Urologie (SIU). Results Most recommendations are guided by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) organ injury severity system. Grade A evidence is rare in genitourinary trauma, and most recommendations are based on Grade B or C evidence. The findings of the most recent urological trauma guidelines are summarised. All guidelines recommend conservative management for low-grade injuries. The major difference is for haemodynamically stable patients who have high-grade renal trauma; the SIU guidelines recommend exploratory laparotomy, the EAU guidelines recommend renal exploration only if the injury is vascular, and the AUA guidelines recommend initial conservative management. Conclusion There is generally consensus among the three guidelines. Recommendations are based on observational or retrospective studies, as well as clinical principles and expert opinions. Multi-institutional collaborative research can improve the quality of evidence and direct more effective evaluation and management of urological trauma.

AB  - Abstract Aim Surgical treatment of high anal fistulas is associated with the potential risk of faecal incontinence and recurrence. The primary aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of three-dimensional endoanal ultrasound (3D-EAUS) in the assessment of height and type of anal fistulas, compared to the intra-operative findings (gold standard). The secondary aim was to evaluate the inter-observer reproducibility of 3D-EAUS. Method The study design was a prospective analysis of retrospective data. 299 patients (202 men), mean age 45.3 years, who underwent surgery for anal fistulas, were included. All patients were preoperatively assessed by 3D-EAUS. Two readers independently reviewed the volumes to determine the type and height of fistulas. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, proportion of agreements and Cohen's kappa coefficient (?) were calculated for both examiners. Ultrasound findings were compared with intra-operative data (reference standard), evaluated blindly by the surgeons. Results At surgery, 201 (67%) were transsphincteric, 49 (16%) suprasphincteric, 47 (16%) intersphincteric and two (1%) extrasphincteric fistulas. Intra-operatively, 177 (59%) were low and 122 (41%) high fistulas. The overall accuracy of 3D-EAUS was 91% for fistula type (271/299 fistulas: 97% transsphincteric, 100% intersphincteric, 57% suprasphincteric, 0% extrasphincteric) and 92% for fistula height (275/299 fistulas: 80% high and 100% low). Both readers reported very good agreement with surgery in the assessment of fistula type (proportion of agreement 0.88, ? = 0.89) and height (proportion of agreement 0.90, ? = 0.91). Conclusions 3D-EAUS is an accurate and reproducible modality for the assessment of type and height of anal fistulas.

AB  - Abstract Catheter-based intravascular ultrasound is a relatively new imaging tool to examine endovascular structure. One major goal for the development of intravascular ultrasound imaging has been to help clarify the mechanism of interventional therapies such as balloon angioplasty and directional atherectomy. Pathologic studies have suggested that plaque distribution and composition are key features that relate to initial and long-term success of coronary interventions. However, relatively little is known by angiography about the nature of plaque in the clinical setting. Intravascular ultrasound imaging provides a high resolution, ?on-line? method of tracking the effects of catheter interventions such as balloon angioplasty and atherectomy. Because of its ability to visualize tissue beneath the luminal surface, ultrasound is generating new insights into the effect of plaque composition and distribution on the response to catheter therapies. With pre-procedure ultrasound imaging, it is increasingly possible to predict the result of a particular intervention, offering the potential for developing strategies of lesion-targeted therapy based on certain plaque characteristics. This article presents the early results of the GUIDE trial as a ?works in progress? view of the role of intravascular ultrasound in helping interventionalists to understand?and to optimize?angioplasty and atherectomy. ? 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - ??Abstract:? Obturator neuralgia (ON) presents with pain in the groin, medial thigh, and sometimes the medial aspect of the knee. The causes include trauma, obturator hernia, pelvic cancer, pelvic surgery, hip surgery, following pelvic fractures, endometriosis, retroperitoneal hematoma, pregnancy, and delivery. Ultrasound (US) guidance facilitates real-time imaging, identification of vascular structures, and improves patient comfort in situations where nerve stimulation can be unpleasant. This is a case report of ON successfully treated with US-guided steroid injection. A 55-year-old man was referred to the pain clinic with groin pain and allodynia in the medial thigh and knee following a fall. He had tried multiple other therapies and none of them provided significant relief. Using a 10?5-MHz multi-frequency, 38-mm linear array transducer, the obturator nerve was scanned in both longitudinal and transverse directions. Under real-time imaging 10?mg of medroxy-progesterone in a volume of 1?mL was injected. Following the injection, a small area of the medial side of knee was still tender to light touch. A second injection was placed inferiorly and provided pain relief for more than 5 months. This successful demonstration of US guidance in ON may further encourage US guidance in pain clinic interventions.??
