AB  - Although uncommon, and despite the modern in diagnostic tools and therapeutic alternatives, retrohepatic and main hepatic veins injury remains associated with high mortality rate. Preoperative diagnosis is uncommon, and bullet trajectory may be a helpful sign in penetrating trauma patients. Patients and Methods? Hospital records of patients sustaining retroheptic vena cava (RHVC) injury were retrospectively reviewed as to diagnosis, associated injuries, injury characteristics, surgical management, and outcome, last ten years. Results? Eight male, 17 to 45 (mean 27.5) years-old patients sustaining RHVC injury were reviewed. Mean trauma indexes for the 8 cases were: ISS 36.6, RTS 7.55 and TRISS 89.0; and for the group who died: ISS 41.6, RTS 7.18, and TRISS 80.5. Two patients had sustained blunt trauma (one died), and six had penetrating injuries (two died). The injury diagnosis was achieved during surgery in all cases. A transfixing RHV injury occurred in 4 (50% of the) patients, and was found in all the 3 patients who died. An atriocaval shunt was employed in four patients, 3 of them had with transfixing injury with two deaths. The number of associated injuries was higher in the patients who died. Overall mortality rate was 37.5%. Comments? Despite advances in image diagnosis, injuries to RHVC are frequently diagnosed during surgery. Tangential injuries were managed with direct approach and sutures, and to control blending in transfixing injuries, were managed with atriocaval shunts, before suture. Conclusion? Despite improvements in its diagnosis and management, RHVC injuries remain with a high mortality rate, mainly when transfixing, and associated with numerous associated injuries.

AB  - Abstract Background: To examine whether the complex branched fibers observed in mdx mutant mice were formed in normal skeletal muscles, long-term repetitive muscle trauma was applied to muscle of normal Wistar male rats. Methods: Three kinds of artificial muscle trauma?crush injury, bupivacaine hydrochloride treatment, and forced stretching of contracting muscle (eccentric contraction)?were performed once a week for 10 weeks to achieve a state of repetitive degeneration and regeneration in the muscles. Two weeks after the final treatment, numerical, histochemical, and three-dimensional analyses by scanning electron microscopy were performed. Results: Mean numbers of total branched fibers of the three groups were increased compared with normal control values, especially in the bupivacaine treatment group (three- to fivefold greater than in the other two groups). Aggregations of fibers of the same type which usually appear in mdx mice were observed in various parts of histological sections of the bupivacaine treatment group and only in a part of the crush injury group. No aggregations were observed in sections of the forced stretching group. In the three-dimensional analysis, complex branched fibers appearing as an ?anastomosing syncytial reticulum? were observed only in the bupivacaine treatment group. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the formation of an anastomosing syncytial reticulum is one of the adaptation mechanisms of normal skeletal muscle rather than a specific event in mdx mutant mice, and long-term repeated trauma of the same fiber is necessary for this formation. Adaptive changes in the muscles with the three different types of muscle trauma are discussed. ? 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary The incidence of multiple pregnancies continues to rise, in part due to the increasing use of assisted reproduction techniques. Due to the serious maternal and perinatal complications with multiple pregnancies and the further increased risks with higher order multiples, selective fetal reduction has been offered in an attempt to improve perinatal outcomes. This invasive, ultrasound-guided, percutaneous procedure has theoretical risks of pregnancy loss, morbidity to the surviving fetuses and associated risks of premature ruptured membranes and preterm labour. It also evokes complex ethical and moral issues for the parents, clinicians and society as a whole. Pregnancy outcome rates have improved following selective fetal reduction as experience with techniques have improved and the number of very high order pregnancies has reduced.

AB  - Abstract? Brooke Army Medical Center isolated 25 highly antibiotic-resistant Acinetobacter ssp. (primarily A. baumannii) from wounded soldiers returning from Iraq. Concern about effective treatment of these organisms led our institution to begin investigating low-frequency ultrasound (LFU) as a method of increasing the effectiveness of antibiotics on A.baumannii in wound management. Studies have suggested that LFU applied in conjunction with antibiotics may increase their overall effectiveness. We hypothesize that combining antibiotics with LFU may be an effective method of wound management and that this combination may be synergistic in its overall effect. In this initial work, we wanted to determine if sonocation would have an effect on our organism of interest, A. baumannii. We selected several organisms, both gram positive and gram negative, that have been shown to be killed by sonocation (E. coli, S. aureus, and S. pyogenes) and added three highly resistant A. baumannii isolates. Bacterial death was measured by both colony counts after 24 hours of growth and acridine orange staining using a standard protocol. Colony counts were significantly reduced by sonocation. Furthermore, A.'baumannii colony counts were also greatly reduced by sonocation. Actual cell destruction was also visualized using acridine orange staining. Our data support the assertion that sonocation has an antibacterial effect on some bacteria, including A. baumannii. Our next step is to add antimicrobial agents and determine if their effectiveness can be increased by sonocation.

AB  - Contrast-enhanced multi-detector computed tomography (CE-MDCT) is used routinely in evaluating human patients with acute abdominal symptoms. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) continues to be in its infancy as it relates to evaluation of the acute abdomen. The purpose of this study was to compare survey radiography, B-mode ultrasound, CEUS, and CE-MDCT findings in canine patients presenting with acute abdominal signs; with a focus on the ability to differentiate surgical from non-surgical conditions. Nineteen dogs were prospectively enrolled. Inclusion required a clinical diagnosis of acute abdominal signs and confirmed surgical or non-surgical causes for the clinical signs. Agreement for the majority of recorded imaging features was at least moderate. There was poor agreement in the identification of pneumoperitoneum and in the comparison of pancreatic lesion dimensions for B-mode vs. CEUS. The CT feature of fat stranding was detected in cases including, but not limited to, gastric neoplasia with perforation, pancreatitis, and small intestinal foreign body. Ultrasound underestimated the size and number of specific lesions when compared with CE-MDCT. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound was successful in detecting bowel and pancreatic perfusion deficits that CE-MDCT failed to identify. Accuracy for differentiation of surgical vs. non-surgical conditions was high for all modalities; 100%, 94%, and 94% for CE-MDCT, ultrasonography and survey radiography respectively. Findings indicated that CE-MDCT is an accurate screening test for differentiating surgical from non-surgical acute abdominal conditions in dogs. Focused CEUS following CE-MDCT or B-mode ultrasonography may be beneficial for identifying potentially significant hypoperfused lesions.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of multi-slice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) enhanced scanning and postprocessing techniques in the diagnosis of arterial root lesions (ARL) in order to improve the understanding and diagnostic accuracy of ARL. We retrospectively analyzed the MSCT imaging findings of 1546 patients. MSCT parameters included the aortic valve annulus level, sinuses of Valsalva level, a sinotubular junction level, ascending aorta, effective diameter, aortic wall thickness, coronary artery height, and coronary sinus depth. The specific measurement method used was curved planar reformation. MSCT found 93 cases of aortic valve disease (AVD). The diagnostic accuracy of MSCT for AVD was 91.7% (33/36). MSCT found 95 cases of acute aortic syndrome involving the aortic root, 71 of which were Stanford type A-aortic dissection (AD), 22 cases of Stanford type A-interstitial hematoma (IHM), and two cases of penetrating aortic ulcers (PAU). MSCT diagnosed Stanford type A-AD, Stanford type A-IHM, and PAU had a specificity of 99.8% and a sensitivity of 98.9%. In conclusion, MSCT enhanced scanning and postprocessing techniques can accurately display the aortic root and adjacent structures, with clear positioning and high diagnostic accuracy, which can provide important basis for clinical diagnosis, preoperative localization, and postoperative follow-up.

AB  - Purpose: All cardiothoracic consultations initiated at Accident and Emergency Department for period February 1995 to November 2000 were reviewed. Methods: Information was extracted from Trauma Registry of over 1000 cases. Results: 61 consultation was recorded. There were 33 blunt injury and 28 penetrating injury. 21 cases were of ISS 15 or less. Surgery for thoracic injury was performed in 13 cases of blunt injury (40%) and 20 cases of penetrating injury (70%). Majority of surgery was related to chest wall and lung injury. In addition there were 3 major intrathoracic vessel, 6 cardiac, 3 diaphragmatic and 1 major airway injury. 20 deaths were recorded with 4 deaths at A&E department. Mortality is related to severity of ISS and age >70. 4 ER-thoracotomy was performed with 3 deaths. There were related to heart and aorta injury with average ISS≥50. Conclusion: 1. Major cardiothoracic trauma is not common. 2. When present, it is associated with severe injury. 3. The outcome is related to severity of ISS and old age.

AB  - Importance There is a paucity of evidence analysing the treatment of cyclodialysis clefts. Background We describe outcomes following the treatment of this rare condition at six centres internationally. Design Retrospective case series. Participants Thirty-six patients with a cyclodialysis cleft from 2003 to 2017 were recruited. Methods Clefts were treated with cycloplegic agents, laser therapy and/or surgery. Main Outcome Measures Postoperative best recorded visual acuity (BRVA), intraocular pressure (IOP) and the rate of cleft closure. Results The mean age was 45?±?17?years and 29 (80.6%) patients were male. One eye (2.8%) received only medical therapy, 5 (13.9%) received laser, 14 (38.9%) underwent surgery after laser failure and 16 (44.4%) eyes received exclusively surgery. Over 80% of eyes had a BRVA improvement of more than two lines. Closure was attained in 30 eyes (93.8%; n?=?32), with postoperative stabilized IOP?≥?12?mmHg in 29 eyes (80.6%; n?=?36) and postoperative BRVA ≤20/50 in 20 eyes (58.8%; n?=?34). Improved postoperative BRVA was related to better preoperative BRVA (P =?0.006) and preoperative IOP?≥?4?mmHg (P =?0.03). There was no significant difference between treatment approach for IOP?≥?12?mmHg (P =?0.85) or postoperative BRVA ≤20/50 (P =?0.80). Only two eyes at last follow-up required IOP lowering medication. Conclusions and Relevance There was a high closure rate with most eyes eventually requiring surgery. Clinically significant improvements in BRVA were found in most eyes. Improved postoperative BRVA was significantly related to better preoperative BRVA and IOP.

AB  - The orbit is made up of seven bones, of which, the inferior wall is most vulnerable to injury and the lateral wall, the least common. In assessing facial trauma, it is crucial to include a comprehensive examination and to manage the orbital fractures accordingly. Orbital floor fracture may present with enophthalmos, diplopia and inferior orbital neuropathy. The infra-orbital rim may show a step-off deformity. Full ophthalmologic evaluation is important to rule out optic nerve neuropathy, retinal bleed, and corneal abrasion. Fracture extending to the superior orbital fissure is known as the superior orbital fissure syndrome, often presented with third, fourth and sixth cranial nerves dysfunction. Orbital roof fracture may involve the frontal lobe and frontal sinus. Fracture involving the naso-orbital ethmoid complex may present with CSF leak, diplopia, displaced medial canthus and nasal fracture. High-resolution 1.5mm CT scans is most useful in the aid of diagnosis in addition to tomography. Displaced fractures should be corrected surgically before bony union. Two examples of complex orbital fractures will be presented, illustrating the importance of a multi-surgical team approach to achieve the optimum results.

AB  - Background? Flail chest in thoracic trauma is associated with significant complications and carries high morbidity and mortality. At present there is no standardized management plan for flail chest. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors affecting morbidity, mortality, and length of stay in the hospital. Methods? We evaluated all patients admitted to our trauma centre between January 2002 and December 2004. Age, presence of pneumothorax, trauma severity score (ISS), length of stay, lung contusion and deaths were recorded. Results? There were 100 patients with a mean age of 52 (SD 19.8, range 17?90). The median length of stay was 17 days, and the average ISS score was 30 (SD 13.2). 74% had flail chest and lung contusion, 2 patients had pneumothorax, and 7 (7%) patients died 3 (5.4%) patients with 1?4 fractured ribs died, compared with 4 (8.9%) patients with 5 or more fractured ribs (p?=?0.70, Fisher?s exact test). The mean ISS score was 32.3 (SD 19.5) for those who died compared with 29.8 (SD 12.7) in those who did not die (p?=?0.63, t-test). There was a moderate positive correlation between ISS score and length of stay (r?=?0.36, p?=?0.0002, Pearson correlation coefficient). Conclusion? ISS score was found to be a moderate potential predictor on outcome regarding length of stay in the hospital. There is an apparent increased risk of death with more fractured ribs and therefore a standadised surgical management plan for ribs fixation may reduce the risk of death in this patient group.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Abdominal metastases (AM) from soft tissue sarcoma (STS) are rare and prognosis is poor. The aims of the study were to (a) identify risk factors for the development of AM and to (b) investigate the outcome of AM-patients. Methods Seven-hundred-sixty-nine STS-patients with localised disease at diagnosis treated at three tumour centres (2000-2016) were retrospectively included (409 males; mean age, 55.6 years [range, 8-96 years]; median follow-up, 4.1 years [interquartile-range, 2.5-6.6 years]). Results Two-hundred-two patients (26.3%) developed secondary metastases, and 24 of them AM (3.1%). Ten patients developed first AM (FAM) after a mean of 2.4 years and 14 patients late AM (LAM, after being diagnosed with metastases to other sites) after a mean of 2.0 years. Patients with liposarcoma had a significantly higher risk of developing AM (P?=?.007), irrespective of grading. There was no difference in post-metastasis-survival (PMS) between patients with AM at any time point and those with metastases to other sites (P?=?.585). Patients with LAM or FAM showed no difference in post-abdominal-metastasis-survival (P?=?.884). Conclusions Survival in patients with AM is poor, irrespective of whether they develop secondarily to other metastases or not. Patients at high-risk of AM (ie, liposarcoma) may be followed-up regularly by abdominal-ultrasound/CT.

AB  - Summary The important role of molar teeth in the dentition mainly consists in their contribution to mastication, because they carry a considerable part of the occlusal load. This chapter reveals how the posterior position of molars makes them less accessible for cleaning, whether it may be self-performed or carried out by a dental professional. This fact, combined with the unique anatomy of molars, poses a challenge for all dentists focusing on molar retention. The evolution of more than one root sets molars apart from the rest of the dentition: in multi-rooted teeth the enamel organ expands with projections of Hertwig's root sheath. Aetiological factors interact with the anatomical factors and may lead to periodontal destruction and attachment loss in molars, and thus result in a furcation defect. It can be concluded that special care needs to be taken when placing restorations, and overhangs need to be diagnosed and removed as early as possible.

AB  - Aim? Whole-body multislice CT-Scanning (MSCT) has become the primary imaging device in many European and North American trauma centres. We aim to present a new standardised protocol that has lead to a markedly improved diagnostic managment in an Australian metropolitan trauma centre. Methods? Based on growing evidence in the literature the MSCT is used as the primary imaging tool in severely injured patients and is routinely performed after completion of primary and secondary survey. The routine protocol consists of a non-contrast head and cervical spine CT, followed by a contrast chest, abdomen and pelvic CT. Apart from an initial chest X-Ray, routine X-ray trauma series are not performed anymore. The criteria for this whole-body MSCT are strictly limited to patients that required trauma team activation and can be sufficiently stabilised in the emergency room. Results? This adapted diagnostic algorithm has shown to be very fast and efficient. The average duration of initial management can be reduced significantly, in addition the number of initially missed injuries is markedly reduced. Conclusions? Primary whole-body MSCT has become a valuable diagnostic tool in the emergency management of severe trauma. A strictly followed protocol has been shown to be crucial to avoid overuse, in terms of radiation as well as exposing the unstable patient to an unnecessary high risk.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction Strychnos nux-vomica L. (Loganiaceae), widely used in folk medicine, is grown extensively in southern Asian countries. Its major bioactive constituents are strychnine and brucine, which are frequently used in traditional herbal medicines for treatment of nervous diseases, vomiting and traumatic pain. Objective A new method using a carbon-paste electrode modified with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT/CPE) was developed and validated for single or simultaneous determination of strychnine and brucine in Strychnos nux-vomica seeds. Additionally, an environmentally friendly method was successfully applied to reduce the levels of strychnine and brucine in seeds. Materials and methods Cyclic voltammetry, chronocoulometry and differential pulse voltammetry were used with multi-walled carbon nanotube modified carbon-paste electrodes. Results The peak currents increase linearly with the strychnine and brucine concentrations in the ranges of 50?1000 and 5?355?µ m, and the detection limits for strychnine and brucine were 0.43 and 0.28?µ m, respectively. Of the processing methods used, the greatest reduction in the strychnine and brucine levels was observed in samples processed using milk and saltwater. Conclusion A new, sensitive and selective method was developed for the measurement of strychnine and brucine. This method was successfully applied to the determination of strychnine and brucine in unprocessed and processed Strychnos nux-vomica seed. Copyright ? 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract The restoration of a traumatized tooth may require minimally invasive or more extensive treatment options. The majority of injuries occur in the younger population, so management should consider the long-term outcome, failure and future treatment needs over the course of, often, many decades. The aim should be to provide a tooth-restoration complex that closely mimics the functional and aesthetic qualities of an intact tooth for as long as possible. This narrative review will assess the relevant literature pertinent to restoration of traumatized teeth in order to provide guidance for the practising clinician.

AB  - Abstract A low-cost 3D printed model has been introduced into the oral and maxillofacial surgery teaching program of undergraduate students to improve education and mechanical comprehension of craniofacial trauma. Steps of the 3D printed haptic model building process are listed. 3D printed models of facial fractures were obtained from Data Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) data. Computed Aided Design and Manufacturing (CAD-CAM) freeware was used to create new fractures on the standard tessellation language (STL) file. 3D printed haptic model appears to be an efficient low-cost support for craniofacial trauma education of undergraduate students.

AB  - Abstract In the present study we evaluated the motor recovery process of peripheral nerve injury (PNI), based on electrophysiological and histomorphometric criteria, after treatment with plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) injections and scaffolds in an ovine model. Three groups of sheep underwent a nerve crush lesion: the first group (n?=?3) was left to recover spontaneously (SR); the second group was administered saline injections (SI; n?=?5) and a third group (n?=?6) received PRGF injections and scaffolds immediately after the crush injury. At post-intervention week 8, 70% of sheep in the PRGF group were CMAP-positive, with no electrophysiological response in the rest of the groups. Histomorphometric analysis 12?weeks after the surgical intervention revealed that the average axonal density of the SR (1184?±?864 axons/µm2) and SI (3109?±?2450 axons/µm2) groups was significantly inferior to the control (8427?±?2433 axons/µm2) and also inferior to the PRGF group (5276?±?4148 axons/µm2), showing no significant differences between the control and PRGF groups. The axonal size of the SR and SI groups was significantly smaller compared with the control group (18?±?4?µm2), whereas the axonal size of the PRGF group (6?±?5?µm2) did not show statistical differences from the control. Morphometry of the target muscles indicated that the PRGF group had the lowest percentage volume reduction 12?weeks after the crush injury. The PRGF group had larger muscle fibre areas than the SI and SR groups, although the differences did not reach statistical significance. Overall, these data suggest that the PRGF injections and scaffolds hastened functional axon recovery and dampened atrophy of the target muscles in an ovine model.
