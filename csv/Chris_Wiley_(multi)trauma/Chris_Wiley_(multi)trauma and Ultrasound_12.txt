AB  - Purpose? To discuss the entire spectrum of injuries seen in lower limb trauma and choice of reconstructive options. Methodology? Retrospective review of 72 consecutive cases in one year. Data collected from individual case records and the department photo data base. Injuries were classified and analyzed based on bone and soft tissue involvement, associated vascular injuries, mechanism of injury as in crush, degloving, and combined. Bony injuries were classified according to Gustilo?s classification. Treatment options and outcome for bone and soft tissue are discussed separately. Results? Total of 72 cases. 95%of cases were two wheeler traffic accidents. Distribution of cases according to site involved: Leg-39; Foot-14; Leg and foot-16; Thigh, leg, and foot-3. 8 of them were of Gustilo?s IIIB and 7 of IIIC. 42 flaps done included Gastrocnemius-4, Soleus-7, reverse sural-7, Cross leg-2, Fasciocutaneous-5 Perforator based local flaps-3Latissimus dorsi-7, Gracilis-6 Lateral thigh-1 Intervention: Immediate: 12%. Early (less than 1 week): 36, Delayed (>1 week): 52% Complications:Wound infection:Minor: 12; Major: 8 (3 Cases ? Clostridia) Partial flap loss: 6; Loss of SSG over flap/donor site: 5; Acute renal failure: 1 Amputations: Above knee: 4; below knee: 2 Conclusions? This series represents the spectrum of high velocity injuries in an overcrowded urban locality of developing country. Significant tissue loss is most often the rule. A judicious execution of reconstructive options can optimize results. Management protocols were adopted to avoid delayed referrals. This audit served as a benchmark to put together a dedicated trauma team in our hospital.

AB  - Background Ultrasound malformations of the fetal genitourinary tract are well documented in the sonographic literature. However, we would like to report on some specific observations. These will include a survey of fetal pelvic kidneys, an association between single umbilical artery (SUA) and absence of one of the kidneys, and the ?Tulip sign?? an ultrasonic marker for severe penoscrotal hypospadias. Method All records of patients with ectopic kidneys over a 5-year period (1995?99) have been perused. Sonographic parameters of ectopic kidney have been evaluated. The same was done for cases of SUA and agenesis of one kidney and for cases with severe penoscrotal hypospadias. Results Pelvic kidney was diagnosed prenatally in 35 cases, of which, bilateral pelvic kidney was detected in 2 cases. There was no predilection for fetal gender, and no tendency to side of appearance. Most cases were diagnosed in late 2nd trimester of pregnancy. The association of SUA and absent kidney was detected in 6 cases. In all cases the diagnosis was made in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy. In 6 cases, the specific ?Tulip sign? was detected prenatally and proven postnatally. Conclusions Unique presentations of renal anomalies can be detected prenatally. Pelvic kidney is easily dealt with, however, the association of SUA and absent kidney requires further evaluation of the fetus to exclude the VATER association. The ?Tulip sign? is helpful in diagnosing severe hypospadias.

AB  - Abstract BACKGROUND To assess whether the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is associated with the risk of prostate cancer (PCa) detection via a multi (≥12)-core prostate biopsy. METHODS From January 2004 to May 2011, 3,107 patients underwent transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) prostate biopsies due to elevated PSA levels ranging between 3 and 20?ng/ml or abnormal digital rectal exams (DREs). Multivariate logistic analysis was used to assess the potential association of LUTS and PCa detection via biopsy. The predictive accuracy of the multivariate model was assessed based on the receiver operating characteristics-derived area under the curve. RESULTS The median International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was 11, and the mean PSA was 6.81?ng/ml. Of the total subjects, PCa was detected from biopsy in 931 (30.0%) patients. In a comparison of 1,465 patients with IPSS ≥11 and 1,642 patients with IPSS <11, those with a higher IPSS were older, had higher PSA and had a larger prostate, but there were no significant differences in the PCa detection rates. However, in multivariate analysis incorporating other associated variables, a higher IPSS was significantly associated with lower odds of PCa detection (P?=?0.016). Nevertheless, addition of the IPSS did not significantly increase the accuracy of the multivariate model devised for the detection of PCa (P?=?0.098). CONCLUSIONS Although PCa was detected less commonly among men with higher LUTS, LUTS may not provide additional prognostic information beyond that which can be obtained via previously established prognostic factors.

AB  - Objectives To report surgical technique, intra- and post-operative complications, and short- and long-term outcome following canine hepatobiliary surgery in which exposure of intra-abdominal hepatobiliary lesions was aided by diaphragmotomy. Materials and Methods Clinical records from four multi-disciplinary UK-based small animal referral hospitals were retrospectively reviewed for dogs in which diaphragmotomy was performed between January 2014 and May 2019. Signalment, diagnosis, surgery performed, diaphragmotomy technique, management of diaphragmotomy and pneumothorax, intra- and post-operative complications, short-term outcome and long-term outcome were recorded. Results Thirty-one cases were identified. The most common hepatobiliary surgeries performed alongside diaphragmotomy were single hepatic lobectomy (14/31) and cholecystectomy (11/31). The most common diagnoses were hepatocellular carcinoma (10/31), gall bladder mucocoele (7/31) and hepatic nodular hyperplasia (4/31). Peri-operative mortality rate was 9.7% (3/31 cases) though none of these deaths were considered attributable to diaphragmotomy. Post-operative complications were encountered in 67.9% (19/28) cases that survived the peri-operative period, of which 25.0% (7/28) suffered complications that were considered attributable or likely attributable to diaphragmotomy. These seven complications resolved following non-surgical intervention. Follow-up was available for 26 of 28 patients that survived to discharge at a median of 4-months (range 10?days to 24?months) following surgery and revealed no evidence of complications related to diaphragmotomy. Clinical Significance Diaphragmotomy appears safe and increases abdominal exposure of hepatobiliary lesions. The benefit of improved exposure must be carefully weighed up against the risks inherent in inducing pneumothorax.

AB  - A six-year-old, neutered, female golden retriever was presented with generalised, dark purple to black cutaneous nodules and gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Histopathologically, all cutaneous nodules were diagnosed as benign cavernous haemangiomas. Endoscopic analysis revealed similar nodules in the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum. At laparotomy, similar nodules were seen on the visceral peritoneal lining of abdominal organs. Metastatic haemangiosarcoma was ruled out based on histological features and lack of primary tumour in spleen, liver or heart ultrasonographically. Blood loss associated with gastrointestinal haemorrhage was managed with blood transfusion. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first canine case of multi-system progressive angiomatosis resembling blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome in humans.

AB  - The establishment and maintenance of vascular access in end-stage renal disease provides a greater challenge. Adequate dialytic therapy requires reliable, long-term access to the blood circulation. Vascular access remains the Achilles' heel of chronic hemodialysis; complications are costly for the patient and society. Vascular access failure is the most frequent cause of hospitalization for patients with chronic renal disease. The general goal was to prevent thrombectomies, thus preventing hospitalizations and reducing cost, and most importantly, saving the patient's access and increasing the survival rate of the graft or fistula. A protocol to evaluate the vascular accesses at the dialysis centers where our patients are dialyzing was implemented. The patients are evaluated before their dialysis treatments, every 2 months if they have a graft and every other visit (4 months) if they have a fistula. New patients will be evaluated every visit by the vascular technician. The protocol (US Vascular Access Protocol) also has attention parameters and depth considerations. The attention parameters refers to blood flows and reductions in size. For example, for a fistula, a normal flow will be 400?mL/min or above, an alert value will be 390?mL/min or below, and a reduction in size of 1.9?mm or below will also be an alert value for the fistula (Table?I). Depth considerations relate to how deep the access is, for example 2?3?mm is ideal to cannulate, 8?mm and above make cannulation impossible (Table?II). Patients with vascular problems are then referred to the vascular surgeon or, as mostly, are referred to interventional radiology. We have found that these Doppler reports are very accurate, and after almost a year, doing these tests at the dialysis center, many accesses have been saved, and dialysis quality has improved in those patients by resolving issues causing re-circulation, stenosis, etc. In conclusion, we need to continue evaluating this program, but the preliminary reports show that by using the Doppler studies prophylactically, dialysis accesses can be saved or their use prolonged, thereby saving costs and reducing the need for future sites for the patient. And, in some cases, improving dialysis adequacy. 1 Attention parameters Normal values Alert values Fistula Access volume flow (mL/min) ≥400 ?0?390 Reductions (mm) ≥2.0 ?0?1.9 Graft Access volume flow (mL/min) ≥600 ?0?590 Reductions (%) 0?49 50?100 2 Depth considerations 2?3?mm Ideal and easy to cannulate 4?5?mm Is acceptable 6?7?mm Increases difficulty of cannulation and increases vessel wall damage ≥8?mm Makes cannulation difficult-to-impossible, causes significant wall damage and infiltrations, requires longer cannula

AB  - Objectives: To compare the volume of in-stent neointimal proliferation, assessed by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), at 6-month follow-up after implantation of a coronary Carbofilm?-coated stent (Tecnic Carbostent?, Sorin Biomedica Cardio, Saluggia, Italy) versus a conventional 316 L stent (Rx Multi-Link Penta, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). Background: Many trials suggest that stent characteristics and coating could be important determinants of restenosis. Methods: From October 2004 to May 2005, 63 patients were randomized to Tecnic (T, n = 30) or Penta (P, n = 33). The primary end-point was in-stent volume of neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) measured by IVUS at 6 months. The secondary end-points included binary restenosis, minimal luminal diameter (MLD), target lesion revascularization, and major adverse cardiac events. Results: There were no significant differences between T and P as to mean age, male gender, clinical status, complexity of the lesion, lesion length, reference vessel diameter before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), MLD pre-PCI, and stent-to-artery ratio. However, MLD poststenting was greater in P group than T group (2.81 ± 0.45 mm vs. 2.49 ± 0.33 mm, P < 0.002). At 6 months, angiographic late lumen loss (0.61 ± 0.51 mm vs. 0.92 ± 0.61 mm, P < 0.043), in-stent obstruction (25.86 ± 16.48% vs. 38.33 ± 19.56%, P = 0.021), and in-stent late loss volume (31.62 ± 29.75 mm3 vs. 57.28 ± 37.16 mm3, P = 0.016) were significantly lower in T group than in P group. Conclusion: Penta stent appears to offer a better deployment and a larger MLD post-PCI than Carbofilm-coated stent. However, a thicker NIH was observed on Penta stent at 6-month follow-up, when compared to Tecnic.

AB  - Background: There is a lack of studies showing the overall impact of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) on the treatment of critically ill patients in a general intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Methods: A prospective observational study on the effects of MDCT on the treatment of patients in a 12-bed medical?surgical ICU in a university hospital providing tertiary care. Results: During the 9-month study period, there were 343 admissions with ICU length of stay longer than 48?h. Of these patients, 64 (19%) had had inconclusive findings with other modalities of radiological imaging, and they underwent altogether 82 MDCT examinations. Fifty examinations (61%) resulted in a change of treatment. The changes included 22 surgical interventions, 16 percutaneous or paranasal interventions, 15 changes of antimicrobial therapy, three withdrawals of active treatment, and four other changes of treatment. Eight patients underwent two and one patient underwent three changes of treatment. Twenty examinations (24%) were regarded as otherwise necessary for clinical decision-making, although no change in the treatment was indicated. Twelve examinations (15%) failed to provide any additional information relevant to the patient's treatment. Conclusion: Sixty-one percent of the MDCT examinations led to a change of treatment, and 24% of them otherwise contributed to or supported clinical decision-making, suggesting that MDCT examination is helpful in the case of general ICU patients, with inconclusive findings with other imaging modalities.

AB  - Abstract Purpose. To evaluate the sonographic features of traumatic neuromas after neck dissection. Methods. This study included 8 patients whose ages ranged from 36?69 years (mean, 49 years). In all cases, traumatic neuromas were incidentally detected at neck sonography for evaluation of suspected recurrence of well-differentiated papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. All sonograms and medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Results. This study covered 8 cases in which traumatic neuromas were diagnosed by clinical, laboratory, fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), and other imaging modalities. None of the patients had clinical signs of neuromas, which were, incidentally, discovered by neck sonography. A noticeable sonographic feature in all cases was an isoechoic mass with internal parallel heterogeneous hyperechogenicity. All patients complained of severe pain during FNAB. The cytological results of 2 patients showed fragments of nerve tissue. The remaining 6 FNABs were nondiagnostic. Thyroglobulin (Tg) levels in washout fluids from FNAB of all patients were <0.2 ng/mL, indicating nonthyroidal origin. Conclusion. Distinctive sonographic features, sharp pain during FNAB, and low Tg levels in FNAB washout fluid can help to diagnose traumatic neuromas without surgery. ? 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has a poorly understood pathology. Patients suffer from a variety of physical and cognitive effects that worsen as the type of trauma worsens. Some noninvasive insights into the pathophysiology of TBI are possible using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and many other forms of imaging as well. A recent workshop was convened to evaluate the common data elements (CDEs) that cut across the imaging field and given the charge to review the contributions of the various imaging modalities to TBI and to prepare an overview of the various clinical manifestations of TBI and their interpretation. Technical details regarding state-of-the-art protocols for both MRI and CT are also presented with the hope of guiding current and future research efforts as to what is possible in the field. Stress was also placed on the potential to create a database of CDEs as a means to best record information from a given patient from the reading of the images. J. Magn. Reson.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Clodronic acid (CA) is a bisphosphonate which inhibits bone resorption through inhibition of formation/dissolution of hydroxyapatite crystals and by direct cellular effects on osteoclasts. The study was conducted to assess the short- and long-term effectiveness of CA for the control of lameness associated with navicular syndrome. Objectives To demonstrate the effectiveness of CA in navicular syndrome. Study design Randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, placebo controlled field trial in client-owned horses. Methods Horses with unilateral or bilateral forelimb lameness (AAEP lameness scale grade ≥2); positive anaesthesia of the distal palmar digital nerve(s); radiographic evidence of navicular syndrome and the absence of other causes of lameness were eligible for enrolment. Horses were randomised to treatment groups in a 3:1 ratio of CA to saline control. Treatment was administered once via intramuscular injection at 1.2?mg/kg bwt (maximum 765?mg CA or 15?ml saline). Efficacy was assessed by comparing lameness grades before and after treatment. Results 146 horses of various breeds were enrolled at 6 sites in Germany and US. At 8 weeks, horses in the CA group had a significantly higher success rate than horses in the control group (least squares mean 74.72% vs. 3.30%; P?=?0.0028). Efficacy was sustained through 180 days in 66% of horses. Adverse events were few and considered to be mild and transient. Conclusions Clodronic acid was safe and effective in navicular syndrome. Ethical animal research:?Owners gave informed consent for their horses? inclusion in the study. Sources of funding:?Dechra Ltd. Competing interests:?The late Dr Frevel was a consultant to Omnimedic GbR, which has applied for a patent for the use of clodronic acid for navicular syndrome. Dr Poole is employed by Dechra.

AB  - This multi-center study evaluated guided tissue regeneration (GTR) in Class II furcation defects using a polylactic acid biodegradable barrier in 29 patients with mandibular and maxillary molar defects. Following an initial hygienic phase, surgical flaps were elevated, and the sites scaled and root planed. Furcation defect perimeter was measured and a customized barrier (thickness 600 to 750 ?) was applied to cover the defect. Barriers adhered directly to tooth and bone. At baseline, sites were measured for probing depth (PD) (6.0 ± 0.2 [SE] mm), gingival margin location (GML) (?0.2 ± 0.2 mm), and attachment level in both vertical (AL-V) (6.2 ± 0.2 mm) and horizontal (AL-H) (5.4 ± 0.2 mm) directions. After the surgical procedure, there was good compatibility between the gingival tissues and barrier material. Clinically, barriers fragmented and became displaced in 3 to 6 weeks. Substantial granulation tissue was sometimes present between barrier and root surfaces. Comprehensive periodontal examination parameters were measured 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after baseline. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to evaluate changes from baseline. At 6 and 12 months postsurgery, GML was close to the presurgical level (?0.5 ± 0.2 mm). There was clinically and statistically significant improvement in all other parameters: mean PD reduction (2.2 mm), AL-V gain (1.7 mm), and AL-H gain (2.5 mm). These results indicated favorable clinical regenerative outcomes after using this barrier material in Class II furcation defects in humans. J Periodontol 1995; 66:377?385.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the long-term outcome of video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) thoracic duct ligation (TDL) and pericardectomy for treatment of chylothorax in dogs. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study. Animals Thirty-nine client-owned dogs. Methods Dogs were included if they had undergone a VATS TDL and pericardectomy and had at least 1-year follow-up or had died within 1 postoperative year. Medical records were evaluated, and recorded data included clinicopathological and diagnostic imaging results, surgical findings, complications, conversion rates, and long-term resolution and recurrence rates. Results Thirty-nine dogs met the inclusion criteria. Two dogs died intraoperatively; 1 was euthanized after severe restrictive pleuritis was diagnosed intraoperatively, and 1 underwent ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest during pericardectomy and could not be resuscitated. Conversion to an open approach was required in 1 of 39 (3%) dogs for TDL and 4 of 36 (11%) dogs for pericardectomy. Overall follow-up time was median 38 months (range, 3-115). Resolution of pleural effusion occurred in 35 of 37 (95%) dogs that survived the perioperative period. Late recurrence of pleural effusion was seen at 12, 12, and 19 months postoperatively in 3 of 35 (9%) dogs that survived the perioperative period and in which chylothorax had initially resolved. Conclusion Successful long-term resolution of chylothorax was seen in a high proportion of dogs that underwent VATS TDL and pericardectomy, although late recurrence was sometimes seen. Clinical significance Video-assisted thoracoscopic thoracic duct ligation and pericardectomy are highly successful in dogs with chylothorax. Future studies should evaluate whether pericardectomy is required in dogs without evidence of pericardial disease.

AB  - Abstract Objective To review the relevant human and veterinary literature regarding the timing of surgical intervention for trauma patients and the impact on outcome. Data Sources Original research, clinical studies, and review articles with no date restrictions from both human and veterinary literature. Human Data Synthesis Despite extensive research into the ideal timing of surgical intervention for human trauma victims, debate is ongoing and views are still evolving. Prior to the 1970s, the standard of care consisted of delayed surgical treatment, as these patients were considered too ill to undergo surgery. Beginning in the 1970s, and continuing for nearly 2 decades, early definitive surgical treatment was recommended. The most recent evolution of human trauma management incorporates the concept of damage control surgery, which acknowledges the importance of early skeletal stabilization or laparotomy for reducing morbidity while attempting to avoid complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Veterinary Data Synthesis Despite a relatively large amount of literature available regarding veterinary trauma, no evidence exists to provide the clinician guidance as to the ideal timing of surgery for trauma patients. With the exception of diaphragmatic hernia, no studies were identified that attempted to evaluate this variable. Conclusions Veterinary-specific studies are needed to evaluate the impact of surgical timing on outcome following trauma. The information that can be obtained from studies in this area can improve veterinary trauma care and may be used as models for human trauma care through translational applications.

AB  - This study explores the experiences of obstetric sonographers imparting diagnostic information which may be considered ?bad news? to expectant mothers. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine sonographers at two London Hospitals to elicit their experiences of giving bad news. Themes which emerged then formed the basis for a quantitative survey of 180 practising obstetric sonographers in England. Their perception of what constitutes ?bad news? was examined. It was found that sonographers were predominantly concerned with lack of time and the unpredictability of the patient's reaction when giving bad news. Staff working in settings where there was a clear protocol specifying how to proceed following disclosure of bad news experienced less stress than those working without such a protocol. These findings have implications for psychologists working with patients who suffer pregnancy loss who may consider provision of support and counselling skills training for sonographers.

AB  - Objectives To compare the progression-free survival of dogs with high-grade T-cell lymphoma treated with either a cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone-based or a modified mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine chemotherapy protocol. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, cases were selected based on histologic or cytologic diagnosis of lymphoma, T-cell phenotype, hypercalcaemia, or both, and no previous chemotherapy for lymphoma. Treatment was not randomly allocated. Results Seventy-three dogs were included in this study: 50 in the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone group and 23 in the mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine group. The median progression-free survival was 133?days for dogs in the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone group and 97?days for dogs in the mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine group. When golden retrievers (n?=?16) were evaluated ?separately, progression-free survival was longer in the cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone versus mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine treatment group (median PFS 154?days versus 70.5 days, respectively). Clinical Significance The progression-free survival time for dogs with multi-centric T-cell lymphoma treated with a modified mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine protocol was similar to that of dogs treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone. Further studies, including those evaluating golden retrievers separately, are needed to confirm these findings.
