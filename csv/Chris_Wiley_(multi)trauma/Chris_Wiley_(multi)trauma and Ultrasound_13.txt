AB  - Abstract Despite the many journal articles and reviews that have been published regarding the treatment of trauma to teeth, the endodontic management of these injuries is often still not fully understood. The purpose of this review is to establish clear and up-to-date guidelines for practitioners who are faced with treating dental injuries on a day-to-day basis, based on an assessment of current available scientific information relating to the endodontic management of these injuries. Treatment is discussed under the headings: infractions, uncomplicated crown fractures, complicated crown fractures, crown-root fractures, root fractures, luxation injuries, avulsion, root resorption, pulp canal obliteration and open-apex teeth. Emphasis is placed on the treatment of traumatized immature teeth where maintenance of pulp blood supply is important to encourage continued development of the root system. Only the treatment of traumatized permanent anterior teeth is reviewed. Information contained in this article is based on a review of the literature on dental trauma which involved a MEDLINE search using the key words ?dental trauma? and the individual topics listed above. The guidelines produced by the International Association of Dental Traumatology, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry and the American Association of Endodontists were also reviewed and the recommendations contained in this paper are in concert with the major recommendations of these bodies.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There is no current evidence on how mild and critical cases of colic can be differentiated at primary examination. Previous research has focused on clinical variables assessed post referral. Objectives To identify features of the primary clinical presentation which differentiate between a critical and mild-medical colic. Study design Prospective multi-centre cross-sectional study. Methods Paper-based and online questionnaires were distributed to 850 practices which treat horses, to collect data on the primary presentation of colic cases over 13 months. Critical cases were defined as horses which died, were subjected to euthanasia, had surgery, or required intensive care. Mild-medical cases were defined as those resolving with medical treatment on a single visit. Descriptive analysis was used to evaluate the data. Univariable analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U tests and Chi-squared tests to assess the degree of association between clinical variables and the dependant variables ?critical? and ?mild-medical?. Results 161 veterinarians submitted 1048 colic case forms; 240 critical cases and 535 mild-medical cases were identified. There was evidence of difference (P<0.000) for cardiovascular variables (heart and respiratory rates, capillary refill time, and mucous membrane colour), signs of pain and abdominal borborygmi between mild-medical and critical cases. Critical cases had a higher mean heart rate (60 beats/min [range 21?125]) than mild-medical cases (42 beats/min [range 18?120]). The median total abdominal borborygmi score was lower at 3 (range 0?12) for critical, compared with 7 (range 0?12) for mild-medical cases. The use of diagnostic tests were significantly different (P<0.0001), with more tests performed in critical cases. Rectal examination and nasogastric intubation were not performed in 17.5% and 52.6% of critical cases, respectively. Conclusions There were significant differences in the primary presentation of critical and mild-medical colic cases. Veterinary surgeons? diagnostic approach varied between cases. Ethical animal research:?The study was reviewed and approved by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham Ethics Committee. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study was not stated. Sources of funding:?Laila Curtis was funded by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. The survey was supported by a grant from the Petplan Charitable Trust. Boehringer Ingelheim assisted with survey distribution. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Abstract The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of Polyheal compared with surgery in treating chronic wounds with exposed bones and/or tendons (EB&T) due to trauma in France, Germany and the UK, from the perspective of the payers. Decision models were constructed depicting the management of chronic wounds with EB&T and spanned the period up to healing or up to 1 year. The models considered the decision by a plastic surgeon to treat these wounds with Polyheal or surgery and was used to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of Polyheal at 2010/2011 prices. Using Polyheal instead of surgery is expected to increase the probability of healing from 0·93 to 0·98 and lead to a total health-care cost of ?7984, ?7517 and ?8860 per patient in France, Germany and the UK, respectively. Management with surgery is expected to lead to a total health-care cost of ?12 300, ?18 137 and ?11 330 per patient in France, Germany and the UK, respectively. Hence, initial treatment with Polyheal instead of surgery is expected to lead to a 5% improvement in the probability of healing and a substantial decrease in health-care costs of 35%, 59% and 22% in France, Germany and the UK, respectively. Within the models' limitations, Polyheal potentially affords the public health-care system in France, Germany and the UK a cost-effective treatment for chronic wounds with EB&T due to trauma, when compared with surgery. However, this will be dependent on Polyheal's healing rate in clinical practice when it becomes routinely available.

AB  - Summary Interpretation of cervical radiographs can be challenging due to the complex anatomy and superimposition of osseous structures on either side of the vertebrae. This report describes the investigation of neck pain in a Thoroughbred gelding following a traumatic fall. Several imaging modalities were used to demonstrate the presence of a fracture of the left cranial articular process of the fourth cervical vertebra (C4), including nuclear scintigraphy, ultrasonography, oblique radiographic projections and a novel cineradiographic technique. Oblique radiographs were superior to standard lateral-lateral radiographs in both the diagnosis and for monitoring the progression of healing of the articular process fracture in this case.

AB  - ABSTRACT Mutations in FLNA (Filamin A, OMIM 300017) cause X-linked periventricular nodular heterotopia (XL-PNH). XL-PNH-associated mutations are considered lethal in hemizygous males. However, a few males with unusual mutations (including distal truncating and hypomorphic missense mutations), and somatic mosaicism have been reported to survive past infancy. Two brothers had an atypical presentation with failure to thrive and distinct facial appearance including hypertelorism. Evaluations of these brothers and their affected cousin showed systemic involvement including severe intestinal malfunction, malrotation, congenital short bowel, PNH, pyloric stenosis, wandering spleen, patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect, inguinal hernia, and vesicoureteral reflux. The unanticipated finding of PNH led to FLNA testing and subsequent identification of a novel no-stop FLNA mutation (c.7941_7942delCT, p.(*2648Serext*100)). Western blotting and qRT-PCR of patients' fibroblasts showed diminished levels of protein and mRNA. This FLNA mutation, the most distal reported so far, causes in females classical XL-PNH, but in males an unusual, multi-organ phenotype, providing a unique insight into the FLNA-associated phenotypes. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Purpose? Monitoring buried free flaps is difficult. Currently in NZ only standard methods of clinical examination and surface doppler are used. We review the first four cases of the Cook Swartz Doppler (CSD) blood flow monitoring system in monitoring free flaps. Method? Retrospective review of the first four clinical applications of the CSD in NZ between October 2006 to January 2007. The doppler was used by 3 different surgeons and interpreted by nursing and medical staff with no prior experience with the device. There were two cases of buried free flaps and two cases where a small skin monitor was utilised to allow clinical correlation with doppler signals. Discussions were held with respective surgeons and other relevant medical and nursing staff. Results? In the two buried flaps (vascularised fibula flap for femur reconstruction and an ALT flap for pharyngeal reconstruction) the probe was inserted downstream of the arterial anastomosis. In the two non-buried flaps (latissimus dorsi to reconstruct a scalp defect and a free TRAM for breast reconstruction) the probe was inserted upstream of the venous anastomosis. There can be difficulty in interpreting the audible signal when the probe is attached to the vein. All surgeons found the technical aspects of inserting and securing the probe to be straightforward. It provided peri- and post-operative assurance of flap viability. All four flaps were viable at one week at the time of probe wire removal. Conclusion? The CSD system is easily applicable to our clinical practice and requires minimal training for both the clinical and nursing staff. It provided peri- and post-operative assurance of flap viability.

AB  - Abstract Purpose: To perform a retrospective audit of cases of uterine arteriovenous malformations (UAVM) at The Canberra Hospital and review of recent literature reporting pregnancies occurring after the diagnosis of UAVM aiming to devise a diagnostic and treatment protocol to optimise pregnancy post UAVM. Methods: A retrospective audit of cases of UAVM at the Canberra Hospital from a prospectively managed patient database was performed. A search of the electronic database PubMed, for articles between 2000?2011 relating to pregnancy post UAVM. Individual case studies were analysed separately to case series. Results: The study included 28 individual studies and five case series (61 women). Average age was 29.5 ± 6.7 (range 18?42). Most women (24, 85.7%, 100% in case series) presented with abnormal vaginal bleeding; 11 (41%) individuals presented post interruption of pregnancy. All women had had a previous pregnancy (mean gravidity 3.1 ± 3.1, range 1?15 for case studies) and only four women (14.2 %) had no history of uterine trauma. Only one woman (3.6 %) did not have any ultrasound and most women underwent colour Doppler ultrasonography (20, 71.4% in case studies; 61, 83.6% in case series). Of the women, 72 (53.6 % of case studies, 78.1 % of case series) were treated with uterine artery embolisation, seven (25%) were treated expectantly. A total of 63 pregnancies occurred post treatment, seven (13.9%) ending in miscarriage. Average time to conceive post diagnosis was 19 months ± 16.3 (range 2?72). A total of 54 healthy infants were born to mothers post AVM diagnosis. Conclusion: UAVM are likely to exist on a continuum with other pregnancy related pathologies, such as sub involution of the placental bed, making a single best diagnostic and treatment plan difficult. However, this study shows that successful uncomplicated pregnancy is achievable for women after the diagnosis of UAVM.

AB  - Abstract We report the case of an ultimately successful liver transplant recipient whose post-transplant course was complicated by the early development of multiple abscesses in the graft. Post-transplant cholangiography identified multiple shear injuries to the second and third order intrahepatic bile ducts, originating from blunt trauma to the donor liver. Treatment was non-operative following recent reports of the successful management of intrahepatic bile duct injury in the stable trauma patient. This discussion adds to the limited literature available on the transplantation of injured donor livers, despite this being a relatively common practice. Further experience is needed in determining the appropriate criteria for the use of traumatized donor livers. Cholangiography carried out on the back table may help to determine if such injured livers are suitable for transplantation.

AB  - Summary Efficient early identification of primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) is important for prognosis, but is not an easy task for non-immunologists. The Clinical Working Party of the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) has composed a multi-stage diagnostic protocol that is based on expert opinion, in order to increase the awareness of PID among doctors working in different fields. The protocol starts from the clinical presentation of the patient; immunological skills are not needed for its use. The multi-stage design allows cost-effective screening for PID within the large pool of potential cases in all hospitals in the early phases, while more expensive tests are reserved for definitive classification in collaboration with an immunologist at a later stage. Although many PIDs present in childhood, others may present at any age. The protocols presented here are therefore aimed at both adult physicians and paediatricians. While designed for use throughout Europe, there will be national differences which may make modification of this generic algorithm necessary.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: To describe case mix variation among institutions, and report adverse event rates in congenital cardiac catheterization by case type. Background: Reported adverse event rates for patients with congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac catheterization vary considerably, due to non-comparable standards of data inclusion, and highly variable case mix. Methods: The Congenital Cardiac Catheterization Outcomes Project (C3PO) has been capturing case characteristics and adverse events (AE) for all cardiac catheterizations performed at six pediatric institutions. Validity and completeness of data were independently audited. Results: Between 2/1/07 and 4/30/08, 3855 cases (670 biopsy, 1037 diagnostic, and 2148 interventional) were recorded, median number of cases per site 480 (308 to 1526). General anesthesia was used in 70% of cases (28 to 99%), and 22% of cases (15 to 26%) were non-electively or emergently performed. Three institutions performed a higher proportion of interventions during a case, 72 to 77% compared to 56 to 58%. The median rate of AE reported per institution was 16%, ranging from 5 to 18%. For interventional cases the median rate of AE reported per institution was 19% (7 to 25%) compared to 10% for diagnostic cases (6 to 16%). The incidence of AE was significantly higher for interventional compared to diagnostic cases (20% vs 10%, p<0.001), as was the incidence of higher severity AE (9% vs 5%, p<0.001). Adverse events in biopsy cases were uncommon. Conclusions: In this multi-institutional cohort, the incidence of AE is higher among interventional compared to diagnostic cases, and is very low among biopsy cases. Equitable comparisons among institutions will require the development and application of risk adjustment methods.

AB  - Abstract Background This single-centre study evaluated the outcome of a pancreatoduodenectomy for Grade 5 injuries of the pancreas and duodenum. Methods Prospectively recorded data of patients who underwent a pancreatoduodenectomy for trauma at a Level I Trauma Centre during a 22-year period were analysed. Results Nineteen (17 men and 2 women, median age 28 years, range 14?53 years) out of 426 patients with pancreatic injuries underwent a pancreatoduodenectomy (gunshot n = 12, blunt trauma n = 6 and stab wound n = 1). Nine patients had associated inferior vena cava (IVC) or portal vein (PV) injuries. Five patients had initial damage control procedures and underwent a definitive operation at a median of 15?h (range 11?92) later. Twelve had a pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PPPD) and 7 a standard Whipple. Three patients with APACHE II scores of 15, 18, 18 died post-operatively of multi-organ failure. All 16 survivors had Dindo-Clavien grade I (n = 1), grade II (n = 7), grade IIIa (n = 2), grade IVa (n = 6) post-operative complications. Factors complicating surgery were shock on admission, number of associated injuries, coagulopathy, hypothermia, gross bowel oedema and traumatic pancreatitis. Conclusions A pancreatoduodenectomy is a life-saving procedure in a small cohort of stable patients with non-reconstructable pancreatic head injuries. Damage control before a pancreatoduodenectomy will salvage a proportion of the most severely injured patients who have multiple injuries.

AB  - Summary The shoulder has greatest range of motion of any joint in the body, and is a frequent site of injury. Shoulder girdle includes proximal humerus, scapula, and lateral clavicle. The anatomic structures involved in fracture of the proximal humerus include humeral head, anatomic neck, surgical neck, and greater and lesser tuberosities. The fractures to the proximal humerus result from a direct blow, fall on an outstretched hand in the elderly, or are related to glenohumeral joint fracture-dislocation. Fractures of the humeral shaft may result from direct trauma, high-velocity motor vehicle accidents or a fall. Scapular fractures are infrequent as the scapula is surrounded and protected by large and prominent muscle attachments. Acromioclavicular joint injury is commonly due to a fall onto the point of the shoulder. Radiographs are generally the first step in initial imaging modality for patients with shoulder trauma.

AB  - Abstract Background Single-event multi-level chemoneurolysis (SEMLC) is a single-session procedure that treats various limbs of patients with spasticity at multiple levels with chemoneurolytic agents. Phenol is used in combination with botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) to enable spastic muscles to be treated without overdosing with BTX-A. Objective To review unintended effects (UEs) of SEMLC for children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP). Design Retrospective chart review. Setting Pediatric rehabilitation outpatient clinic at an academic medical center. Participants The study included 98 children with CP who underwent SEMLC on at least one occasion. Interventions SEMLC. Main Outcome Measures UEs, the goal achievement for each SEMLC session, and the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS-ER). Results A total of 98 subjects and 146 SEMLC procedures were reviewed. Patients had a mean age of 7.56 years (standard deviation, 4.28); 57% were male; and 14 had hemiplegia, 22 had diplegia, 8 had triplegia, and 54 had quadriplegia. Most SEMLCs (72%) were performed with a combination of BTX-A and 5% phenol in a session. UEs were reported for 31/146 (21%) of SEMLC sessions, with 16 of 31 UEs being temporary weakness. The overall incidence of UEs of the group that received combined agent treatment was not different from the group that received BTX-A only (P = .267). Transient pain occurred in 7 of 105 patients who were treated with the combined agents BTX-A and phenol. Dysesthesia did not develop in any of the patients. The type of CP, GMFCS level, number of muscles injected, and doses of medications were not correlated with the incidence of UEs. Conclusions SEMLC using combined BTX-A and phenol is a safe procedure for children with spastic CP. It could be a treatment option for patients with diffuse spasticity, because combining agents allowed more muscles to be treated without enduring or serious UEs. Patient and family education is essential to prepare them for the occurrence of common UEs, such as temporary weakness and pain.

AB  - Post-traumatic headache (PTH) is an important public health issue ? head injuries are common, headache is the most common sequelae of head injuries, and PTH can be particularly disabling. Fortunately, for most individuals with PTH, the headache gradually dissipates over a period of several days, weeks, or months either spontaneously or aided by non-pharmacologic and/or pharmacologic management. Regrettably, for a minority of head-injured individuals, the PTH is intractable and disabling despite aggressive and comprehensive treatment. Unfortunately, there are many prejudices against individuals with PTH. Frequently, the presence or absence of litigation and/or the mechanism of head injury (sports-related trauma, slip-and-fall injury, motor vehicle accident, or military service-related injury) biases physicians' views on the legitimacy of the patient's PTH. Accordingly, this review attempts to summarize the state of the art of our understanding of PTH. This clinical review highlights: (a) views on PTH throughout the last few centuries, (b) the ICHD-2 classification of PTH, (c) the epidemiology of head injuries and PTH, (d) the clinical characteristics of PTH, (e) PTH related postconcussive symptoms, (f) pathophysiology of PTH, (g) evaluation of PTH, and (h) management of PTH.

AB  - Introduction: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in dogs with urinary catheters in intensive care units (ICUs) are frequent. Historically, multi-drug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli account for about 10% of the UTIs. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of E. coli infections and of MDR E. coli in dogs with UTIs in our ICU, and to assess whether the MDR E. coli were community-acquired or nosocomial in origin. Methods: Over a 1-year period, rectal swabs were taken from all dogs in the ICU on the day of admission (D0) and on days 3 (D3), 6 (D6), 9 (D9) and 12 (D12). Urine was collected on these days from dogs with an indwelling urinary catheter (n=190). Rectal swabs and urine were routinely cultured. E. coli isolates were identified by biochemical tests. Using NCCLS guidelines, antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by disk diffusion method on fecal and urinary E. coli isolates. Twelve antimicrobial agents were used: nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin, and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to compare MDR E. coli UTI strains with fecal E. coli strains from the same patient and with MDR fecal E. coli from patients that were adjacent to, or housed in the same cages. Results: E. coli was cultured from 12 (48%) of 25 UTIs. Two of the E. coli were MDR. For one dog, PFGE showed no similarities among fecal E. coli and the urinary MDR E. coli isolates from the patient or between these isolates and fecal E. coli from a dog housed in the same kennel on the previous day. The MDR E. coli UTI was likely acquired prior to admission to the ICU, as it was present on D0. For the other dog, PFGE showed genetic similarity but not complete identity between the D3 MDR E. coli urinary isolate and the D3, D6, D9 fecal MDR isolates. This suggests that the UTI originated with the fecal E. coli. Using selective plates, fecal MDR E. coli were not found on D0. Selection of the MDR strain in the intestine by the use of antibiotics occurred while the dog was in the ICU and possibly led to the UTI. Conclusions: Multi-drug resistant E. coli accounted for 2 of 12 E. coli UTIs in dogs in the ICU over a 1-year period. Genotyping showed that one of the two MDR E. coli infections could possibly be of nosocomial origin.
