AB  - Abstract Objectives To describe the ultrasonographic anatomy of the caudal lumbar spine in cats and to detect ultrasound (US) signs associated with epidural or intrathecal injection. Study design Prospective, clinical study. Animals Twenty-six client-owned cats. Methods Transverse (position 1) and parasagittal (position 2) two-dimensional US scanning was performed over the caudal lumbar spine in all cats. Midline distances between the identified structures were measured. Cats assigned to epidural injection (group E, n = 16) were administered a bupivacaine?morphine combination confirmed by electrical stimulation. Cats assigned to intrathecal injection (group I, n = 10) were administered a morphine?iohexol combination injected at the lumbosacral level and confirmed by lateral radiography. The total volume injected (0.3 mL kg?1) was divided into two equal aliquots that were injected without needle repositioning, with the US probe in positions 1 and 2, respectively. The presence or absence of a burst of color [color flow Doppler test (CFDT)], dural sac collapse and epidural space enlargement were registered during and after both injections. Results US scanning allowed measurement of the distances between the highly visible structures inside the spinal canal. CFDT was positive for all animals in group E. In group I, intrathecal injection was confirmed in only two animals, for which the CFDT was negative; seven cats inadvertently and simultaneously were administered an epidural injection and showed a positive CFDT during the second aliquot injection, and the remaining animal was administered epidural anesthesia and was excluded from the CFDT data analysis. Dural sac collapse and epidural space enlargement were present in all animals in which an epidural injection was confirmed. Conclusions and clinical relevance US examination allowed an anatomical description of the caudal lumbar spine and real-time confirmation of epidural injection by observation of a positive CFDT, dural sac collapse and epidural space enlargement.

AB  - Summary Objective Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is probably a specific marker of vascular inflammation. However, associations of PTX3 with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk have not been well studied in healthy adults or multi-ethnic populations. We examined associations of PTX3 with CVD risk factors, measures of subclinical CVD, coronary artery calcification (CAC) and CVD events in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Approach and Results Two thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight participants free of prevalent CVD with measurements of PTX3 were included in the present study. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, PTX3 was positively associated with age, obesity, insulin, systolic blood pressure, C-reactive protein (CRP), and carotid intima?media thickness (all P < 0.045). A one standard deviation increase in PTX3 level (1.62 ng mL?1) was associated with the presence of CAC in fully adjusted models including multiple CVD risk factors (relative risk of 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01?1.08). In fully adjusted models, a standard deviation higher level of PTX3 was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR] 1.51; 95% [CI] 1.16?1.97), combined CVD events (HR 1.23; 95% [CI] 1.05?1.45), and combined CHD events (HR 1.33; 95% [CI] 1.10?1.60), but not stroke, CVD-related mortality, or all-cause death. Conclusions In these apparently healthy adults, PTX3 was associated with CVD risk factors, subclinical CVD, CAC and incident coronary heart disease events independently of CRP and CVD risk factors. These results support the hypothesis that PTX3 reflects different aspects of inflammation than CRP, and may provide additional insights into the development and progression of atherosclerosis.

AB  - Introduction: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in dogs with urinary catheters in intensive care units (ICUs) are frequent. Historically, multi-drug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli account for about 10% of the UTIs. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of E. coli infections and of MDR E. coli in dogs with UTIs in our ICU, and to assess whether the MDR E. coli were community-acquired or nosocomial in origin. Methods: Over a 1-year period, rectal swabs were taken from all dogs in the ICU on the day of admission (D0) and on days 3 (D3), 6 (D6), 9 (D9) and 12 (D12). Urine was collected on these days from dogs with an indwelling urinary catheter (n=190). Rectal swabs and urine were routinely cultured. E. coli isolates were identified by biochemical tests. Using NCCLS guidelines, antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by disk diffusion method on fecal and urinary E. coli isolates. Twelve antimicrobial agents were used: nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin, and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to compare MDR E. coli UTI strains with fecal E. coli strains from the same patient and with MDR fecal E. coli from patients that were adjacent to, or housed in the same cages. Results: E. coli was cultured from 12 (48%) of 25 UTIs. Two of the E. coli were MDR. For one dog, PFGE showed no similarities among fecal E. coli and the urinary MDR E. coli isolates from the patient or between these isolates and fecal E. coli from a dog housed in the same kennel on the previous day. The MDR E. coli UTI was likely acquired prior to admission to the ICU, as it was present on D0. For the other dog, PFGE showed genetic similarity but not complete identity between the D3 MDR E. coli urinary isolate and the D3, D6, D9 fecal MDR isolates. This suggests that the UTI originated with the fecal E. coli. Using selective plates, fecal MDR E. coli were not found on D0. Selection of the MDR strain in the intestine by the use of antibiotics occurred while the dog was in the ICU and possibly led to the UTI. Conclusions: Multi-drug resistant E. coli accounted for 2 of 12 E. coli UTIs in dogs in the ICU over a 1-year period. Genotyping showed that one of the two MDR E. coli infections could possibly be of nosocomial origin.

AB  - Summary.? Background:?Recurrent thromboembolic events after an initial deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are relatively frequent. Residual thrombus in the affected veins on ultrasound scan at the completion of anticoagulant therapy has been described as a recurrence risk factor, and may have utility in stratifying those patients at risk. Objectives:?The aims of the study were to correlate the risk of recurrence of DVT with the results of ultrasound at completion of oral anticoagulant therapy. A secondary aim was to review the mortality in this population. Patients:?A cohort of 316 DVT patients was included. The patients were divided into those with completely clear vessels on follow-up scan (45%) and those with residual thrombus identified (55%). Results:?The cumulative incidence of recurrence was 10% by 2?years and 23% by 5?years. Patients with residual thrombus on follow-up ultrasound were at higher risk of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 2.2, 1.19?4.21; P?=?0.012) which remained significant after multivariate adjustment for age, gender and malignancy (HR 2.2, 1.15?4.17; P?=?0.018). During follow-up, the cumulative mortality was 12% at 2?years and 27% by 5?years. The risk of death was increased in patients with residual thrombus on follow-up scan (HR 3.9, 1.93?7.71; P?<?0.001) and this risk persisted after multivariate analysis of age, gender and malignancy (2.8, 1.37?5.72; P?=?0.005). The majority of deaths were due to malignancy (68%) however 10 (18%) died from vascular causes. There was a trend towards increased vascular death in the patients with residual thrombus on follow-up ultrasound scan, which did not reach significance (HR 4.1, 0.87?19.33; P?=?0.13). Conclusions:?Consistent with previous cohort studies, recurrence risk is increased in patients with residual thrombus on ultrasound. The increased risk of death in patients with residual thrombus, with a trend towards increased vascular death, may suggest that failure of thrombus resolution is a marker of more global vascular dysfunction.

AB  - Abstract Each year, 1.4 million people in the United States are seen in a hospital for a traumatic brain injury. Those with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury frequently go through a course of inpatient neurorehabilitation prior to discharge back into the community. A broad overview of neurorehabilitation is presented, including the standards for admission to inpatient rehabilitation and the members and roles of the neurorehabilitation team. Common medical complications that are managed after moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury are reviewed. The spectrum of arousal issues is summarized. The evidence regarding neurorehabilitation is then reviewed. Future studies that are underway to better understand the utility of neurorehabilitation are then discussed.

AB  - Background: Severe periodontal furcation invasion has long been a treatment dilemma for the clinician. Many techniques have been advocated in the treatment of multi-rooted posterior teeth ranging from conventional scaling and root planing (SRP), apically positioned flaps, root amputations, root resections, tunnel procedures, guided tissue regeneration, and restorations. The keys to success depend on the clinician's ability to access the furcation to remove local factors and create an environment that enhances the patient's own hygiene efforts. Long-term success in treating teeth with furcation invasion depends upon tooth retention and arresting the destructive processes within the furcation area. Methods: A Class III furcation invasion in a mandibular molar was treated by surgical access for SRP along with obliterating the furcation utilizing a resin ionomer restoration. Results: Initially, the patient was asymptomatic. Within 3 months of treatment, the patient presented with suppuration that was refractory to local efforts. Radiographs taken only 5 months postsurgery demonstrated advanced bone loss apical to the restoration. The tooth ultimately was extracted because mobility increased and the tooth became symptomatic. Conclusions: The clinician must consider the multi-factorial etiology of periodontal breakdown within a furcation. For this patient, the technique of sealing off the exposed furcation with restorative material appeared to have resulted in progressive bone loss and accelerate tooth loss. This single case report is presented as a rebuttal to recently published articles, which have demonstrated excellent results when treating furcations with ionomer restorations.

AB  - Objective To estimate the value of a new vascular score, hypoxia index (HI), in prediction of functional and/or structural brain lesions caused by fetal hypoxia and to examine the relationship between this index, Doppler cerebral-umbilical ratio (C/U) and neonatal neurosonography in growth retarded and hypoxia fetuses. Study design In the prospective study 41 growth retarded fetuses were included from 29 to 40?weeks of gestation. Flow velocity waveforms the umbilical and middle cerebral arteries were recorded each other day, at least two weeks. The C/U ratio and HI were calculated. After the birth, obstetric parameters and ultrasound of neonatal brain were used as outcome parameters. Results Doppler C/U ratio <?1 as well as HI?>?150 were associated with poor perinatal outcome. The neonatal brain damage was detected in 16 growth-retarded and hypoxic fetuses. Hypoxia index had greater statistic significance in the prediction of neonatal brain lesions. Also, specificity and sensitivity of HI was better than the last value of C/U ratio measured before delivery. Conclusions The C/U ratio and HI represent the best indicators for early detecting and assessment of fetal hypoxia. Furthermore, they may also be parameters for the prediction of poor neurological outcome in pregnancies with growth retardation. So, the use of HI would represent a significant advance in prevention of hypoxic brain lesions, which are one of the most frequent causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Summary Testicular germ cell tumours have a favourable prognosis if detected early, but are potentially lethal in a subset of patients. Multi-modality treatment is often necessary, thus the preferable time of diagnosis is at the pre-invasive, but unfortunately often asymptomatic precursor stage of carcinoma in situ (CIS). This review describes current possible approaches for the detection of CIS. At present, an open testicular biopsy is the only definitive way of establishing the presence of CIS. The tissue section should be of an adequate size, be properly fixed, and evaluation be supported by at least one solid immunohistochemical marker, for example PLAP, OCT-3/4 or AP-2?. Determination of who should be offered testicular biopsies is based on clinical and ultrasonic examination along with the evaluation of risk factors. A surgical biopsy is an invasive procedure with potential complications, although rare. Therefore, a noninvasive and equally reliable method is needed. Testicular ultrasound is risk-free, painless and at present the only noninvasive method of aid for andrologists when CIS is suspected. The presence of testicular microlithiasis is, in some cases, indicative of pre-malignant changes, especially in males with additional risk factors. Promising results have recently been obtained with a novel noninvasive detection method based on immunocytological AP-2?-staining of CIS cells in semen. This method could be a supporting method in andrology centres where careful follow-up is possible. In conclusion, one difficulty is to determine in which males CIS should be suspected; secondly, there does not as yet exist an optimal noninvasive method of diagnosis that is more acceptable than an open surgical biopsy.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Forceps delivery is associated with a high rate of levator ani muscle (LAM) trauma (avulsion) at 35%-65% whereas data on avulsion rates after vacuum delivery vary greatly. Nevertheless, a common characteristic of all previous studies carried out to evaluate the association between instrumental deliveries (forceps and vacuum) and LAM avulsion, is the fact that characteristics of the instrumentation have not been described or evaluated. The objective of this study is to compare the rate of LAM avulsion between forceps and vacuum deliveries according to the characteristics of the instrumentation. Material and methods Prospective, observational study, including 263 nulliparous women, who underwent an instrumental delivery with either Malmström vacuum or Kielland forceps. The characteristics of the instrumentation, position (anterior position and other position) and height of the fetal head at the moment of instrumentation (low instrumentation [vertex at +2 station] and mid-instrumentation [head is involved but leading part above +2 station]) were assessed. Evaluation of LAM avulsion was performed at 6 months postpartum by three-/four-dimensional transperineal ultrasound. Using the multi-view mode, a complete avulsion was diagnosed when the abnormal muscle insertion was identified in all three central slices, that is, in the plane of minimal hiatal dimensions and the 2.5-mm and 5.0-mm slices cranial to this one. To detect a 30% or 15% difference in the LAM injury rate, with 80% power and 5% α-error, we needed, respectively 42 and 99 women per study group. Results In all, 263 nulliparous individuals have been evaluated (162 vacuum deliveries, 101 forceps deliveries). Instrumentation in an occipito-anterior position was more frequent in vacuum deliveries (75.3% vs 56.4%, P = .002), whereas other positions were more frequent in the forceps deliveries group (24.7% vs 43.6%). No statistically significant differences were noted regarding the height of the fetal head at the moment of instrumentation. No statistically significant differences were found in the presence of LAM avulsion (41.4% vs 38.6%) between vacuum and forceps deliveries. The univariate analysis of the crude odds ratio was 1.17, 95% CI 0.67-1.98, P = .70 for the avulsion of the LAM and the multivariate of the adjusted OR 0.90, 95% CI; 0.53-1.55, P = .71. Conclusions We consider that, in our population, LAM avulsion rate should not be a factor taken into account when choosing the type of instrumentation (Malmström vacuum or Kielland forceps) in an operative delivery.

AB  - Abstract Background The management of hepatic hemangiomas remains ill defined. This study sought to investigate the indications, surgical management and outcomes of patients who underwent a resection for hepatic hemangiomas. Methods A retrospective review from six major liver centres in the United States identifying patients who underwent surgery for hepatic hemangiomas was performed. Clinico-pathological, treatment and peri-operative data were evaluated. Results Of the 241patients who underwent a resection, the median age was 46 years [interquartile range (IQR): 39?53] and 85.5% were female. The median hemangioma size was 8.5?cm (IQR: 6?12.1). Surgery was performed for abdominal symptoms (85%), increasing hemangioma size (11.3%) and patient anxiety (3.7%). Life-threatening complications necessitating a hemangioma resection occurred in three patients (1.2%). Clavien Grade 3 or higher complications occurred in 14 patients (5.7%). The 30- and 90-day mortality was 0.8% (n = 2). Of patients with abdominal symptoms, 63.2% reported improvement of symptoms post-operatively. Conclusion A hemangioma resection can be safely performed at high-volume institutions. The primary indication for surgery remains for intractable symptoms. The development of severe complications associated with non-operative management remains a rare event, ultimately challenging the necessity of additional surgical indications for a hemangioma resection.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? In-office evaluation of erectile dysfunction by color duplex Doppler ultrasound (CDDU) may benefit the decision-making process in regard to choosing the most appropriate therapy. Unfortunately, there is no uniform standardization in performing CDDU resulting in high variability in data expression and interpretation when comparing results among various centers, especially when conducting multicenter trials. Establishing standard operating procedures (SOPs) is a major step that will help minimize such variability. Aim.? This SOP describes CDDU procedure with focus on establishing uniformity and normative parameters. Main Outcome Measure.? Measure intra-arterial diameter, peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, and resistive index for each cavernosal artery. Methods.? After initial discussion with the patient about his history and International Index of Erectile Function evaluation describe procedural steps to the patient. Perform the CDDU in a relaxed state, scanning the entire penis (in B-mode image) using a 7.5- to 12-MHz linear array ultrasound probe. An intracorporal injection of a single or combination of vasoactive agents (e.g., prostaglandin E1, phentolamine, and papaverine) is then administered and CDDU performed at various time points, preferably with audiovisual sexual stimulation (AVSS). Results.? Monitor penile erection response (tumescence and rigidity) near peak blood flow. Self-stimulation or AVSS leaving the patient alone in room or redosing may be considered to decrease any anxiety and help achieve a maximum rigid erection. Conclusion.? Considering the complexity and heterogeneity of CDDU evaluation, this communication will help in standardization and establish uniformity in such data interpretation. When indicated, invasive diagnostic testing involving (i) penile angiography and (ii) cavernosography/cavernosometry to establish veno-occlusive dysfunction may be recommended to facilitate further treatment options.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives The increasing incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) and the consequent progression to cirrhosis is expected to become a major cause of liver transplantation. This will exacerbate the organ donor shortage and mean that ?marginal? fatty liver grafts are more frequently used. Autofluorescence spectroscopy is a fast, objective, and non-destructive method to detect change in the endogenous fluorophores distribution and could prove to be a valuable tool for NAFLD diagnosis and transplant graft assessment. Materials and Methods A system was constructed consisting of a fibre probe with two laser diodes that provided excitation light at 375 and 405?nm, and an imaging spectrograph system. This was used to distinguish fluorescence spectra acquired from the harvested livers from mice with NAFLD of differing severity (healthy, mild steatotic and steatohepatitic). The fluorescence data were entered into a sparse multiclass probabilistic algorithm for disease classification. Histopathology, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and alanine transaminase (ALT) assays were conducted in addition to the fluorescence measurements Results TBARS and ALT assays enabled differentiation of the steatohepatitic group from the mild steatosis and control groups (P?≤?0.028) but failed to separate the mild steatotic group from the control group. The three groups were all clearly differentiated from each other using fluorescence spectroscopy, and classification accuracy was found to be 95%. Conclusion Fluorescence spectroscopy appears to be a promising approach for the analysis of diseased liver tissue. Lasers Surg. Med. 43:392?400, 2011. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To evaluate primary repaired obstetric lesions of the anal sphincter complex on anal endo-ultrasound within a few days and 8?weeks after primary repair and to investigate in this way the influence of suboptimal woundhealing on the final anatomical result. Furthermore to investigate the relation between faecal incontinence and sphincter defects. Design? A prospective cohort study. Setting? The obstetric clinic and coloproctology outpatient clinic of the Zaans Medical Centre in Zaandam, the Netherlands. Subjects? A cohort of 32 consecutive women with primary surgically repaired 3B, 3C or 4th degree anal sphincter defect after vaginal delivery. Main outcome measures? Appearance of the anal sphincter complex on anal endo-ultrasound within a few days week and 8?weeks after primary surgical repair, i.e. first and second ultrasound, respectively. Evaluation of anal continence, using the Vaizey incontinence score, at second ultrasound. Results? No major wound breakdown was seen and four women had superficial, skin related wound problems. Twenty-eight women (87.5%) had a repaired external anal sphincter on the first and the second ultrasound. Of four external anal sphincter defects on first ultrasound one defect was not present on second ultrasound. The internal sphincter showed a defect on first ultrasound in 11 women and this was still present in 10 on second ultrasound. A total of 11 women had a persisting anal sphincter defect (external, internal or in combination). Mean Vaizey scores were significantly higher in women with a persisting sphincter defect (EAS, IAS or in combination) than in women with no sphincter defects, 2.3 and 0.4 respectively (95% CI 0.1?3.6, P?=?0.04). Conclusion? Anal endo-ultrasound may be used for early evaluation of surgical repair of anal sphincter lesions after vaginal delivery. Persisting defects in the anal sphincters, in this series not because of major wound breakdown, can be explained by inadequate surgical repair.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To assess the prevalence of levator ani muscle injury in Chinese women after their first delivery and investigate associated factors. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted involving Chinese nulliparous women recruited in the first trimester of pregnancy. Translabial ultrasound was performed at 35?38 weeks' gestation and 8 weeks postpartum and three-dimensional volume datasets were obtained. Offline analysis to detect levator ani muscle injury was performed by investigators blinded to the delivery details. Results 339 women, with a mean age of 30.6 ± 3.9 years, completed the study. Overall, 201 (59.3%) had a spontaneous vaginal delivery, 62 (18.3%) an operative vaginal delivery (48 ventouse extraction and 14 forceps delivery), 14 (4.1%) an elective Cesarean section and 62 (18.3%) an emergency Cesarean section. No levator ani muscle injury was detected in any woman antenatally. After vaginal delivery, 57 (21.7% (95% CI, 16.7?26.7%)) women had levator ani muscle injury. The rates of injury for spontaneous vaginal delivery, ventouse extraction and forceps delivery were 15.4%, 33.3% and 71.4%, respectively. There was no levator ani muscle injury in the Cesarean section groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that only operative vaginal delivery (odds ratio, 3.09) was associated with an independent increase in the likelihood of levator ani muscle injury. Intrapartum epidural analgesics, duration of second stage of labor and infant birth weight were not independently associated with levator ani muscle injury. Conclusions The prevalence of levator ani muscle injury in Chinese women after their first vaginal delivery was 21.7% (95% CI, 16.7?26.7%). Operative vaginal delivery was found to increase the likelihood of women suffering such injury. A longer follow-up of these women and future studies on the effects of episiotomy are proposed.

AB  - Aims To present a series of urinary bladder xanthomas and characterize their clinical features and associated pathology. Methods and results We retrieved the clinicopathological data of bladder xanthomas, with and without associated urothelial neoplasms. We identified six isolated bladder xanthomas and 11 arising within or adjacent to urothelial neoplasms. The biopsies showed lamina propria aggregates of foamy histiocytes, without an accompanying inflammation. Patients presented either incidentally or with microscopic haematuria or irritative symptoms. Patients with isolated xanthomas had a mean age of 65.3 years (range: 54?75 years) and an equal male to female ratio. Four of five patients with isolated xanthomas with available serum results had an abnormal lipid profile. Eleven patients had xanthomas associated with urothelial neoplasms [papilloma n = 4, papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential (PUNLMP) n = 2 and low-grade urothelial carcinoma n = 5]. Mean patient age was 62.5 years (range: 51?69 years) and all were male. Of the six patients with metabolic abnormalities, five had hypercholesterolaemia and one had a history of diabetes mellitus. Conclusion Bladder xanthomas are rare lesions found in older patients who present either non-specifically or with microscopic haematuria or irritative symptoms. These lesions are often associated with underlying lipid abnormalities. A biopsy is recommended for an accurate diagnosis and to exclude neoplasia.

AB  - Summary Multidetector-row computed tomographic contrast angiography (MDCTA) is routinely employed to investigate vascular masses in human patients but, to date, the use of this technique to investigate an aneurysmal mass has not been reported in an equine case. The potential of MDCTA to investigate a right-sided parapharyngeal mass in a 6-week-old Thoroughbred foal was therefore investigated. A 4-slice helical computed tomography scanner was used on a superficial, firm, ovoid mass yielding arterial blood on fine needle aspiration. MDCTA enabled identification of the vessels involved thus assisting in forming a diagnosis based on the morphology of the lesion and aided surgical planning. Histology confirmed the presence of mural thrombus and calcification within the smooth muscle wall consistent with a true aneurysm. MDCTA provided additional information to conventional imaging in this case of vascular masses of the head and neck. The technique therefore has the potential to improve diagnosis and assist in the management of such lesions.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To review the current recommendations for the care of the seriously injured polytraumatized small animal patient, including team organization and facility readiness; scene assessment and care; transport; and hospital assessment and care. Data sources: Original research articles, scientific reviews, book chapters, and clinical experience. Human data synthesis: The care of the seriously injured patient is demanding and requires adequate preparation, rapid access to organized resources and equipment, and skilled personnel. Second in urgency only to stabilization of the airway and breathing is shock. In many, surgical intervention to provide improved and continued stability is required. Evidence is provided by data published comparing survival for humans with high injury scores being cared for at level I trauma centers compared with small rural hospitals. Personal experience as a member of an emergency medical team in the care of multiple injured human patients in both level I trauma centers and small hospitals is also used in this review. Veterinary data synthesis: Publications reporting large clinical series of seriously injured dogs and cats are minimal. Experimental animal models of shock caused by blood loss and the study of various organ injuries and their management are numerous. These and 35 years of the author's experience in managing severely injured dogs and cats (estimated to be >750) is also used in this review for generation of guidelines. Conclusions: Guidelines for care of severe multiple injury patients are presented and are recommended to be used in clinical veterinary medical practice to improve outcome.
