AB  - Abstract: The purpose of this study was to clarify the actual therapeutic potential of a new transdermal drug delivery system (electromotive drug administration; EMDA) for selected patients with Peyronie's disease. Forty patients with Peyronie's disease were treated by electromotive administration of the 3-drug association orgotein-dexamethasone-lidocaine in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, partial crossover study (study 1). Another 25 patients were treated by EMDA with a combination of verapamil-dexamethasone in an uncontrolled study (study 2). Treatment sessions lasted 20 minutes each and took place 3 times a week for 3 weeks with a current of 3 mA. Patients were assessed before treatment and at 1-and 3-month follow-up examinations. Assessments were based on sexual history, physical examination, and dynamic color Doppler ultrasonographic results. Adverse effects of EMDA were not reported. In study 1, the clinical results observed after treatment proved to be significantly better than those of the placebo. Penile pain disappeared in all patients in both studies. Penile lesion (nodule or plaque) either disappeared or significantly improved in 79% and 90% of patients treated by the 3-and 2-drug association, respectively. The improvement of penile deformity also was notable although it did not match the effect observed on penile nodules or plaque (62% and 88%, in studies 1 and 2, respectively). In both studies, more than 80% of patients reported a definite amelioration of penile rigidity, which paralleled the improvement of penile dynamic color Doppler ultrasonographic parameters. Overall, the combination of verapamil-dexamethasone achieved better clinical results than the 3-drug combination. Electromotive drug administration is a novel technique capable of safely achieving satisfactory results in selected patients with Peyronie's disease not only in terms of improvement of patient's symptoms but also due to the reduced need for penile surgery.

AB  - Abstract Objectives.? The ongoing conflict in Afghanistan continues to generate a large number of complex trauma injuries and provides unique challenges to military anesthetists working in forward field hospitals. We report successful use of ultrasound-guided continuous transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block in two Afghan war casualties who sustained major trauma with coagulopathy. The use of bilateral continuous TAP blocks following major thoracoabdominal trauma in a combat environment is unique in the literature. Design.? Case report. Results.? The acute perioperative outcomes of two Afghan civilian patients were improved with bilateral continuous TAP blocks. Multiple benefits shared by both patients included early extubation, excellent analgesia, and minimal post-operative morphine requirements despite the setting of a massive blood transfusion and coagulopathy. Conclusions.? A continuous TAP block technique can be utilized to provide excellent analgesia following major abdominal surgery when neuraxial anesthesia is contraindicated. The TAP block's ease of placement under ultrasound guidance makes this technique particularly useful in the austere battlefield hospital environment.

AB  - Background:? The objectives of this study were to (1) describe the haemodynamic profile of patients with extensive burns during the early fluid resuscitation phase, (2) evaluate myocardial performance by invasive monitoring and echocardiography and (3) analyze the relations between serum cytokine (IL-6, IL-8, TNF) and natriuretic peptide (ANP, BNP) concentrations and myocardial function in these patients. Methods:? Prospective, clinical study in a tertiary care burn centre. Invasive haemodynamic measurements including a pulmonary artery catheter, echocardiography, blood samples for cytokine and atriopeptide analyses. The follow-up time was up to 72?h postinjury. Results:? According to echocardiography, patients were hypovolaemic despite aggressive (median 7,9?ml?kg?1?h?1, range 3.3?11.7) fluid resuscitation and adequate urine output (median 0.9?ml?kg?1?h?1, range 0.46?1.35) during the first day postinjury. There were no consistent findings of hyperlactatemia, metabolic acidosis or low mixed venous oxygen saturations. Daily highest and lowest values of cardiac index and stroke volume index increased and the lowest and highest values of systemic vascular resistance decreased. Cardiac performance (stroke volume index) improved during the study period even though there were no initial signs of myocardial depression in echocardiography. Three patients received a dobutamine infusion based on clinical judgement. There was no consistent association between haemodynamic changes and plasma cytokine concentrations. Conclusion:? Persisting hypovolaemia is evident in the resuscitation phase of extensive burns despite aggressive fluid therapy and the lack of classic signs of hypoperfusion. Cardiac performance improves during the first days after extensive burn injury without association with plasma cytokine profile.

AB  - Objectives Blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI) is a known sequela of high-energy craniomaxillofacial (CMF) trauma and can result in stroke or death. The objective of this systematic review is to 1) identify CMF trauma patients who may benefit from BCVI screening and 2) describe the optimal diagnostic and treatment modalities. Study Design Systematic review of the literature (1946?2013). Methods An a priori study protocol was created using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis. The authors conducted a search of Ovid/Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane databases for articles related to BCVI and CMF fractures. All abstracts were reviewed, and data was extracted to determine the incidence of BCVI in the setting of CMF trauma. Individual fracture patterns were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results Twenty-one studies met inclusion criteria. The overall incidence of CMF fracture-associated BCVI was 0.45%. The majority of patients (86.6%) sustained BCVI in the setting of high-energy trauma. The distribution of CMF fractures among BCVI patients was the mandible (12.5%), followed by the maxilla (11.8%). Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) was the most common diagnostic modality. A total of 63.1% of patients with BCVI were managed medically. The mortality among CMF patients with BCVI was 23.9%, and stroke rate was 47.1%. Conclusion Blunt cerebrovascular injury is a rare but devastating complication of blunt trauma. The recommended screening modality is CTA, and the most common treatment is antiplatelet/anticoagulant medication. Mandibular and LeFort fractures were the most common isolated CMF injury associated with BCVI, highlighting the need for prospective trials to expand current screening criteria.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively useful sonographic diagnostic criteria for testicular rupture in patients with blunt scrotal trauma and to determine significant predictors among the criteria. Methods From July 2004 to February 2007, 29 consecutive patients (mean age, 22.8 years; range, 20?43 years) with blunt scrotal trauma who underwent scrotal sonography were enrolled. Ten ruptured testes and 6 intact testes were confirmed by surgery, and an additional 13 intact testes were confirmed by a physical examination. The sonographic findings were recorded with respect to contour irregularity, the presence of intratesticular and extratesticular heterogeneous echoes, loss of blood flow on color Doppler sonography, and engorgement of the pampiniform plexus by consensus between 2 radiologists. The sonographic findings used to diagnose testicular rupture were analyzed by the Fisher exact test, and significant predictors were determined by multiple regression analysis. Results The ruptured testes showed contour irregularity (P = .0002), a heterogeneous intratesticular echo pattern (P = .0077), and loss of blood flow on color Doppler sonography (P = .0093). Engorgement of the pampiniform plexus was seen in most nonruptured testes (P = .0178). Contour irregularity was the only significant predictor for the diagnosis of testicular rupture (P = .0002). On the basis of this single predictor, diagnostic predictive values for sonography were calculated; the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were all 90%. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 82% and 94%, respectively. Conclusions Among the useful sonographic criteria, contour irregularity is the only significant predictor for the diagnosis of testicular rupture in patients with blunt scrotal trauma.

AB  - Abstract Background: We report a multi-institutional experience with intravascular stenting (IS) for treatment of coarctation of the aorta. Methods and Results: Data was collected retrospectively by review of medical records from 17 institutions. The data was broken down to prior to 2002 and after 2002 for further analysis. A total of 565 procedures were performed with a median age of 15 years (mean = 18.1 years). Successful reduction in the post stent gradient (<20 mm Hg) or increase in post stent coarctation to descending aorta (DAo) ratio of >0.8 was achieved in 97.9% of procedures. There was significant improvement (P < 0.01) in pre versus post stent coarctation dimensions (7.4 mm ± 3.0 mm vs. 14.3 ± 3.2mm), systolic gradient (31.6 mm Hg ± 16.0 mm Hg vs. 2.7 mm Hg ± 4.2 mm Hg) and ratio of the coarctation segment to the DAo (0.43 ± 0.17 vs. 0.85 ± 0.15). Acute complications were encountered in 81/565 (14.3%) procedures. There were two procedure related deaths. Aortic wall complications included: aneurysm formation (n = 6), intimal tears (n = 8), and dissections (n = 9). The risk of aortic dissection increased significantly in patients over the age of 40 years. Technical complications included stent migration (n = 28), and balloon rupture (n = 13). Peripheral vascular complications included cerebral vascular accidents (CVA) (n = 4), peripheral emboli (n = 1), and significant access arterial injury (n = 13). Older age was significantly associated with occurrence of CVAs. A significant decrease in the technical complication rate from 16.3% to 6.1% (P < 0.001) was observed in procedures performed after January 2002. Conclusions: Stent placement for coarctation of aorta is an effective treatment option, though it remains a technically challenging procedure. Technical and aortic complications have decreased over the past 3 years due to, in part, improvement in balloon and stent design. Improvement in our ability to assess aortic wall compliance is essential prior to placement of ISs in older patients with coarctation of the aorta. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background:?? Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programs have gained popularity in colonic surgery. Hospital stay has been reduced dramatically as a result, but remains varied in the published literature. We were interested in investigating the factors that influence hospital stay in an ERAS setting. Methods:?? Between October 2005 and November 2008 prospective data were collected on consecutive patients undergoing elective colonic resection, without a stoma, at a single site. Patients were managed within an ERAS program. Patients unable to communicate in English, with dementia or ASA >4 were excluded. Variables were tested using the Mann-Whitney U and Spearman's two tailed correlation table for continuous data. Cox regression analysis was used for modelling. Results:?? 102 patients were included. There were 57 right sided, 43 left sided and 2 total colectomies. Mean age was 66?years (95% CI, 40?88). Median day stay was 4?days (range 3?46). Indications for surgery were: malignancy (80%), diverticular disease (13%) and other (7%). Age, operation site, ASA, indication for surgery and BMI were not significant predictors of hospital stay. Factors with the strongest correlation for reduced day stay were Cr-Possum score (p = 0.006), female sex (p = 0.013), laparoscopic (n = 6) and transverse (n = 32) incisions (p < 0.001), and the operating surgeon (p < 0.001). Using Cox regression modeling, surgeon and patient gender could be eliminated as independent predictors of day stay. The other two factors added significant strength to the model. Conclusion:?? Choice of incision and Cr-POSSUM score are independent predictors of day stay in the ERAS setting.

AB  - Abstract Objectives:? To determine the institution's current non-therapeutic (negative) appendicectomy rate; the frequency of clinical predictors for appendicitis in patients who underwent appendicectomy; and the utilization and accuracy of ultrasound scans (USS) and computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of appendicitis. Methods:? A retrospective chart review was conducted in an adult, metropolitan teaching hospital. Patients who presented to the ED and underwent an appendicectomy over a 12-month period were analysed. Symptoms and signs predictive of appendicitis, results of USS and CT scans if performed, and histopathology findings were abstracted from patient records. Results:? Two hundred and forty patients had appendicectomies, 147 (61%) were male and the median age was 25 years (range 14?78 years). The negative appendicectomy rate was 14.3% (95% CI 9.1?21.0%) and 18.3% (95% CI 11.0?26.7%) in males and females, respectively. Abdominal pain shifting to the right iliac fossa (RIF), anorexia and RIF rebound tenderness were found more frequently in patients with positive than negative appendicectomies (P < 0.05). USS and CT scans were performed in 68 (28%) and 15 (9.5%) patients, respectively. The likelihood ratio for appendicitis in patients with a normal USS or a normal CT scan was 0.83 (95% CI 0.56?1.24) and 0.08 (95% CI 0.01?0.60), respectively. There were no false positive CT scan results. Conclusion:? Computed tomoraphy scanning should play an increasing role in the ED management of suspected appendicitis. Our negative appendicectomy rate could potentially be halved by the introduction of CT scans in the diagnostic work up of these patients.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to evaluate the characteristics and importance of superficial echogenic lesions around cranial sutures on neonatal cranial sonography. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records and neuroimaging studies of 40 neonates who had superficial echogenic lesions around sutures on neonatal cranial sonography. Magnetic resonance imaging (n = 18) and computed tomography (n = 2) were performed within 2 weeks after sonography. We correlated sonographic findings with computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging findings and analyzed them. We also evaluated the associated lesions, neurologic signs, and follow-up changes. Results Sonographically, the superficial echogenic lesions involved both sulci and perisulcal parenchyma in 39 neonates and were located in the frontal and parietal areas around the sagittal suture in 38 neonates. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a pattern of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy in 9 neonates, birth trauma in 3 neonates, a mixed pattern of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and trauma in 3 neonates, nonspecific single infarctions in 2 neonates, and lack of a defined lesion in 1 neonate. The associated lesions were subdural hemorrhage (n = 12), epidural hematoma (n = 4), germinal matrix hemorrhage (n = 3), intraventricular hemorrhage (n = 2), and periventricular leukomalacia (n = 1). All epidural hematomas were associated with scalp hematoma, and 2 patients had skull fractures. One neonate with epidural hematoma associated with a hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy pattern showed mild spasticity in both ankles until 16 months. Conclusions Superficial echogenic lesions detected around cranial sutures on neonatal sonography may be an indicator of more serious intracranial lesions such as more extensive hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and intracranial hematomas, including epidural hematoma.

AB  - Literature describing medical treatment of canine prostatic carcinoma (PC) is sparse. The aims of this study were to assess outcomes, including time to progression (TTP) and median survival time (MST), of canine PC treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or chemotherapy, and to identify prognostic factors. Records from 8 institutions were searched for dogs with cytologically or histologically confirmed PC without bladder involvement: 67 dogs were included. Presenting signs were urinary (25), gastrointestinal ([GI], 11) and systemic (3); 16 dogs had GI and urinary signs, 7 dogs had systemic signs with concurrent GI or urinary signs and in 5 dogs the tumour was an incidental finding. Out of 27 dogs, 9 (33%) had positive urine culture. Metastases were identified in 26 dogs to lymph nodes (19), lungs (10), bone (2) and liver (1). Treatment included NSAIDs and chemotherapy (32), NSAIDs alone (31) and chemotherapy alone (4). The overall MST was 82 days (range 9-752) and median TTP was 63 days (range 9-752). Dogs receiving NSAIDs combined with chemotherapy experienced a significantly longer MST (106 vs 51 days; P?=?.035) and TTP (76 vs 44 days; P?=?.02) compared to dogs receiving NSAIDs alone. Intact dogs and those with metastatic disease had significantly shorter MST (31 vs 90 days, P?=?.018 and 49 vs 109 days, P?=?.037, respectively); intact dogs also had significantly shorter TTP (25 vs 63 days, P?=?.0003). This study suggests that a combination of NSAIDs and chemotherapy may improve outcomes in canine PC. Metastatic disease and being entire negatively influenced prognosis.

AB  - Summary.? Diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) is an important medical problem because of the high fatality rate from PE and the large number of cases not diagnosed before causing death. Over the last decade, there has been considerable research into the diagnostic process. It is widely accepted that venous ultrasound imaging is an accurate test for the diagnosis of DVT and is the imaging test of choice. For PE, computer tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is replacing ventilation perfusion lung scanning. Technology for CTPA is rapidly evolving and multi-row detector scans have quite reasonable sensitivity and specificity. Despite the accuracy of imaging tests, the post-test probability of disease is highly dependent on pretest probability. Clinical evaluation tools have developed that enable us to accurately categorize patients? risk prior to diagnostic imaging. One advantage of this characterization is an ability to exclude the diagnosis of DVT or PE if clinical probability is sufficiently low and when the D-dimer is negative. There are now a number of D-dimer assays that have well-defined specificities and sensitivities, which enable use in conjunction with clinical probability. A careful combination of clinical assessment, D-dimer and imaging enables safe PE rule out protocols without imaging, an ability to suspect false positive imaging results, and more accurate determination of true positive imaging. These integration strategies result in safer, more convenient and cost-effective care for patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To describe the presentation, diagnosis, cause, complications and outcome in 14 dogs that presented with a parotid sialocoele and that were treated by complete parotidectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS Multi-institutional retrospective study. RESULTS Each dog presented with a non-painful, fluctuant, soft tissue mass over the lateral aspect of the face in the region of the parotid salivary gland. Diagnosis was made by sialoradiography (3/14), CT (3/14), ultrasound (11/14) and MRI (2/14). The cause of the sialocoele could be determined in 8 of 14 patients and included: foreign body (2/14), sialolithiasis (1/14), neoplasia (3/14), salivary gland lipomatosis (1/14) and trauma (1/14). Treatment incurred one anaesthetic complication (regurgitation) and seven postoperative surgical complications [self-limiting seroma formation (2/14), haemorrhage (1/14), wound dehiscence (1/14), abscessation 7 months postoperatively (1/14) and facial nerve paralysis (2/14)]. Sialocoele did not recur in any dog during a median follow-up time of 14 months. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Parotidectomy has been considered a technically challenging procedure but can have a good success rate with long-term resolution of the clinical symptoms. Intra- and postoperative complications are reasonably common.

AB  - ABSTRACT Complications of popliteal cysts may closely mimic the clinical features of a deep venous thrombosis. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the non-invasive procedures of radionuclide venography and popliteal space ultrasound examination compared with those of contrast venography and arthrography, respectively, and then prospectively studied 23 non-surgical patients with acutely painful, swollen calves to determine the utility of these techniques. The cause of this symptom was popliteal cyst complications in 10 patients, deep venous thrombosis in seven patients, and both conditions in two patients. Radionuclide venography was highly reliable and ultrasound examination was specific but only moderately sensitive in these studies. The painful, swollen calf may be investigated adequately in most cases by means of noninvasive techniques; contrast venography and arthrography should be reserved for only a minority of patients.

AB  - The acute Page kidney phenomenon occurs as a consequence of external compression of the renal parenchyma leading to renal ischemia and hypertension. Between January 2000 and September 2007, 550 kidney transplants and 518 ultrasound-guided kidney biopsies were performed. During that time, four recipients developed acute oligo-anuria following ultrasound-guided allograft biopsy. Emergent doppler-ultrasounds were performed demonstrating absence of diastolic flow as well as a sub-capsular hematoma of the kidney. Prompt surgical exploration with allograft capsulotomy was performed in all cases. Immediately after capsulotomy, intraoperative Doppler study demonstrated robust return of diastolic flow. Three patients maintained good graft function, and one kidney was lost due to acute antibody-mediated rejection. We conclude that postbiopsy anuria associated with a subcapsular hematoma and acute absence of diastolic flow on doppler ultrasound should be considered pathognomonic of APK. All renal transplant specialists should be able to recognize this complication, because immediate surgical decompression can salvage the allograft.

AB  - Background and Objectives There is currently intense multidisciplinary interest and a maturing body of literature regarding laser treatments for traumatic scars, but international treatment guidelines and reimbursement schemes have not yet caught up with current knowledge and practice in many centers. The authors intend to highlight the tremendous potential of laser techniques, offer recommendations for safe and efficacious treatment, and promote wider patient access guided by future high-quality research. Study Design/Materials and Methods An international panel of 26 dermatologists and plastic and reconstructive surgeons from 13 different countries and a variety of practice backgrounds was self-assembled to develop updated consensus recommendations for the laser treatment of traumatic scars. A three-step modified Delphi method took place between March 2018 and March 2019 consisting of two rounds of emailed questionnaires and supplementary face-to-face meetings. The panel members approved the final manuscript via email correspondence, and the threshold for consensus was at least 80% concurrence among the panel members. Results The manuscript includes extensive detailed discussion regarding a variety of laser platforms commonly used for traumatic scar management such as vascular lasers and ablative and non-ablative fractional lasers, special considerations such as coding and laser treatments in skin of color, and 25 summary consensus recommendations. Conclusions Lasers are a first-line therapy in the management of traumatic scars and contractures, and patients without access to these treatments may not be receiving the best available care after injury. Updated international treatment guidelines and reimbursement schemes, additional high-quality research, and patient access should reflect this status. Lasers Surg. Med. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background Two methods are presented for the assessment of fetal behaviours under the application of Doppler effects: (a) Measurement of the velocity wave of fetal limb by vibroacustic stimulating. (b) Hydrodynamic evaluation of the transnasal amniotic velocity wave and its relation to gastric peristalsis. Method A Doppler device was employed to assess the velocimetry wave from the ?FEMORAL BONE? in motion, following vibro-acoustic stimulation in 138 phisiological pregnancy and Doppler-aided evaluation of transnasal amniotic hydrodynamics. Results and conclusion Assessment of normal fetal behaviour. Quantification of patterns of reactivity of any body structure. Reduction in the duration of explorations for biophysical profiles. (3?4?min). Fetal reflex responses slow down and become increasingly complex as maturation carries on. Both mean velocity and acceleration of fetal reactive responses experience a gradual decline throughout gestation. The time a fetus takes to respond to a stimulus increases directly with gestational age. Simultaneousness between fetal respiration episodes and phases of gastric distention and activity. (physiological conditions). Fetal active respiration can be unequivocally accounted for by Doppler assessment of the activity of intake/release of amniotic fluid along the high respiratory branches of the pulmonary tree. Amniotic respiratory dynamics are always transnasal in physiological conditions. Velocities of transnasal, decreasing steadily from the 32nd gestational age to the end of gestation.

AB  - Abstract Purpose. To determine the value of color Doppler sonography (CDUS) in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with extracranial and intracranial vertebral artery (VA) dissection. Method. Thirty-three patients aged 42 ± 12 years with 40 VADS confirmed via digital subtraction angiography (DSA) (n = 37) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) (n = 3) were included in the study. All patients were investigated with extracranial CDUS and transcranial CDUS (TCCDUS) over a mean ± SD follow-up period of 42 ± 24 months and occurrence of new ischemic symptoms was assessed. Sonographic results were compared with initial and follow-up angiographic results. Results. At presentation, 24/33 (73%) patients had suffered an ischemic stroke, 5/33 (15%) had a transient ischemic attack (TIA), and 4/33 (12%) were asymptomatic. Two patients had a recurrent vertebrobasilar TIA; there was no recurrent stroke. The initial DSA findings consisted of 14 stenoses, 20 tapered occlusions, and 6 pseudoaneurysms. During follow-up, 63% of the vessels recanalized. Sonographic findings were consistent with angiographic findings in 80% at the initial examination and in 86% during follow-up. The main reason for discordant results was the failure of CDUS to detect pseudoaneurysms. No recurrence occurred in the vertebral arteries (VA), but 1 patient had an asymptomatic carotid artery dissection during follow-up. Conclusion. Recurrent TIA or stroke after VAD appears to be extremely rare, independent of recanalization or persistent occlusion of the affected artery. CDUS and TCCDUS provide reliable follow-up of VAD in all patients presenting with stenosis or occlusion, but do not allow for detection of pseudoaneurysms of the VA. ? 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
