AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the clinical research priorities of Fellows of the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) in order to inform the strategic research agenda specific to multicentre clinical research. Methods An anonymous survey of all ACEM Fellows (FACEMs) listed on the ACEM researcher database was conducted between January and March 2013. Results Of 108 FACEMs invited to participate, 54 (50%) responded. Over half of respondents (61%) had a higher research degree but only a minority (24%) had funded research positions. The top research categories identified as priorities were resuscitation, trauma, cardiology, ED ultrasound, acute behavioural disturbance and geriatrics. The most common specific sub-categories included anterior chest pain, fluid resuscitation in trauma, and drug therapy for both atrial fibrillation and acute behavioural disturbance. Several specific research questions related to chest pain, resuscitation/sepsis, stroke, paediatrics and pulmonary embolus. Conclusion The findings provide guidance and support for research areas amenable to collaborative multicentre clinical research within emergency medicine. Discussion rounds are planned to translate these perceived research priorities to actual priorities.

AB  - Purpose? TRD is an uncommon but serious consequence of blunt trauma. It is often associated with other life threatening injuries and its diagnosis is challenging. Limited information exists on outcomes following rupture, although there are increasing reports of late recurrent herniation. Our aim was to document the outcome of TRD initially and at intermediate term follow up (up to five years). Methodology? A review of all patients suffering TRD, over the past five years, at The Alfred Hospital was performed. Injury severity score (ISS), associated injuries, diagnosis- early versus late and imaging modality used, and surgical repair technique were recorded. All patients were followed up with a questionnaire, regarding symptoms of recurrence and chest X-ray (CXR). Results? 33 patients (18 female, 15 male; mean age 36?yrs, mean ISS 42) were included. All injury mechanisms were high energy (motor vehicle occupants 27, pedestrians 5, horse rider 1); 25 sustained other intra-abdominal injuries. There were nine early and no late deaths. CXR was diagnostic in 14 cases, with 23 recognised early (pre-operatively). 6 were diagnosed intra-operatively (5 for instability, 1 following unremarkable imaging). 3 late diagnoses (>24 hours after presentation) occurred, with 1 at 6 months post injury. Emergent primary repair was undertaken using non-absorbable sutures, although in three cases absorbable sutures were used. Conclusions? TRD is associated with high energy blunt force and severe multi-system injury. We advocate emergent primary repair with non-absorbable suture and advise a minimum five year follow-up.

AB  - Background Echinococcosis is an uncommonly encountered zoonotic disease caused by the taeniid Echinococcus. The only endemic species in Australia, Echinococcus granulosus, forms cysts in the liver in 70% of cases. The aim of this study was to review the literature to provide an evidence-based narrative update on the diagnosis and management of hepatic cystic echinococcosis in Australia. Methods We reviewed the literature, utilizing multiple research databases and citation tracking. Original research and review articles examining the diagnosis and management of hydatid disease in adults, published prior to 2016 and in the English language were included in our review. Results Ultrasound is the gold-standard screening test, whilst computed tomography has a role in emergency presentations and screening for multi-organ involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred second-line imaging and better demonstrates biliary involvement. Medical therapy or PAIR (percutaneous aspiration, irrigation with scolicide and re-aspiration) may be appropriate in selected cases; however, surgery remains the definitive treatment for active, large (>5 cm), symptomatic or complicated cysts. A variety of surgical techniques have been described, including conservative, radical and minimally invasive procedures. There is currently no consensus approach; surgical modality should be tailored to patient factors, relevant anatomy, local facilities and surgeons? expertise. Conclusion Diagnosis and therapy in hepatic hydatid cysts have been significantly advanced by imaging, interventional radiology and surgical approaches in recent years. Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for large, active, complicated or symptomatic hepatic hydatid cysts.

AB  - Abstract The Chocolate BAR study is a prospective multicenter post-market registry designed to evaluate the safety and performance of the Chocolate percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon catheter in a broad population with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. The primary endpoint is acute procedural success (defined as ≤30% residual stenosis without flow-limiting dissection); secondary long-term outcomes include freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR), major unplanned amputation, survival, and patency. A total of 262 patients (290 femoropopliteal lesions) were enrolled at 30 US centers between 2012 and 2014. The primary endpoint of procedure success was achieved in 85.1% of cases, and freedom from stenting occurred in 93.1%. Bail out stenting by independent adjudication occurred in 1.6% of cases and there were no flow limiting dissections. There was mean improvement of 2.1 Rutherford classes (±1.5) at 12-months, with 78.5% freedom from TLR, 97.2% freedom from major amputation, and 93.3% freedom from all-cause mortality. Core Lab adjudicated patency was 64.1% at 12 months. Use of the Chocolate balloon in an ?all-comers? population achieved excellent procedural outcomes with low dissection rates and bailout stent use.

AB  - Abstract Objective The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility, safety and initial efficacy of paclitaxel administration using a novel drug delivery catheter for the prevention of restenosis in infrapopliteal de novo and restenotic lesions. Background Restenosis continues to be a great challenge after percutaneous revascularization procedures for peripheral arterial disease, particularly for below-the-knee applications. Methods A prospective, multicenter first-in-human registry of a novel delivery catheter delivering liquid paclitaxel was conducted in 10 patients. The primary efficacy endpoint at 6 months was freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) and the primary safety endpoint at 1, 3, and 6 months were thrombosis, major amputation in the target limb and target limb related death. Results All patients tolerated the procedure well with no reports of adverse procedural events. Twelve (n?=?12) lesions in ten patients were treated with a mean lesion length of 83.3?±?49.2 mm, with the lesion length range of 30mm to 182 mm. At 6-month follow-up, the rate of CD-TLR was 30% (3 of 10 patients). Zero patients (0 out of 10) demonstrated thrombosis, major amputation in the target limb and target limb related death at the 1, 3, and 6 month follow-up intervals. Conclusions This first in-human experience obtained in a multicenter study of real-world de novo and restenotic lesions demonstrates a favorable safety and efficacy profile at 6 months. Randomized comparison to current drug coated balloons should be performed to further validate this approach and positive experience.

AB  - Abstract Pelvic floor disorders negatively impact millions of women worldwide. Although there is a strong epidemiological association with childbirth, the mechanisms leading to the dysfunction of the integral constituents of the female pelvic floor, including pelvic floor skeletal muscles, are not well understood. This is in part due to the constraints associated with directly probing these muscles, which are located deep in the pelvis. Thus, experimental models and non-invasive techniques are essential for advancing knowledge of various phenotypes of pelvic floor muscle injury and pathogenesis of muscle dysfunction, as well as developing minimally invasive approaches for the delivery of novel therapeutics. The most widely used animal model for pelvic floor disorders is the rat. However, the radiological anatomy of rat pelvic floor muscles has not been described. To remedy this gap, the current study provides the first detailed description of the female rat pelvic floor muscles? radiological appearance on MR and ultrasound images, validated by correlation with gross anatomy and histology. We also demonstrate that ultrasound guidance can be used to target rat pelvic floor muscles for possible interventional therapies.

AB  - Objectives Intra-articular hip joint injections have traditionally relied on the use of image guidance to confirm intra-articular needle placement. Musculoskeletal ultrasound (US) has emerged as a popular tool to aid the clinician in performing intra-articular hip injections. Modern automated injection delivery systems are commercially available and may offer the potential to optimize clinical efficiency while limiting procedural morbidity. The purpose of this study was to compare patient-reported outcomes and clinical efficiency between two US-guided intra-articular hip injection techniques. The hypothesis was that the use of an automated delivery system for US-guided intra-articular hip joint injections would show superiority in clinical efficiency over traditional syringe injections. Methods This study was a level 1 randomized prospective postmarket clinical evaluation. Forty patients were randomly assigned to undergo a single intra-articular corticosteroid injection of the hip using either an automated delivery system (Navigator Delivery System; Carticept Medical, Inc, Alpharetta, GA) or a traditional syringe injection. Enrolled patients were prospectively followed at 1, 6, and 12 weeks after injection. A battery of patient-reported outcomes were collected at baseline and again at 1, 6, and 12 weeks after injection. Preparation times were documented for all injections. Results Forty patients met inclusion criteria and were enrolled. Twenty patients were randomly assigned to receive US guided intra-articular hip injections using the automated system (group A), and 20 patients were treated with standard syringe injections (group B). Body mass index, smoking history, symptom duration, baseline patient-reported outcomes, and demographic data were similar between groups. Improvements from baseline scores were noted at all time points for all patient-reported outcomes regardless of the injection technique used. However, no significant differences were noted at any time point for any of the patient-reported outcomes based on which injection delivery system was used. Statistically significant differences were noted at 6 and 12 weeks for the subjective global assessment score, which favored the use of the automated delivery system over the standard injection technique (6 weeks, P = .029; 12 weeks, P = .028). Between the two injection procedures, there was no difference in pain experienced by the patient (mean Visual Analog Scale pain score ± SEM: group A, 34.9 ± 6.49; group B, 34.5 ± 5.99; P = .960). Body mass index did not influence pain associated with an intra-articular hip injection (P = .870); however, younger patient age was found to be an independent predictor of increased pain associated with injection (P = .011). Although there were no differences among male or female patients in hip injection pain based on the delivery method, statistically significant differences were encountered between male and female patients, irrespective of treatment assignment (male/female: group A, 25.1/41.4; group B, 26.7/46.1; P= .049). Among patients with a smoking history, large differences were noted for injection pain when data for both groups were pooled, regardless of the delivery method (no history, 30.0 ± 4.86; smoking history, 40.8 ± 9.94). Clinical efficiency (as measured by injection preparation time) was found to be inferior for the automated system compared to traditional syringe injection (P < .0001). Conclusions Use of an automated delivery system for US-guided intra-articular hip injections did not show superior efficiency or patient comfort over traditional syringe injections. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections led to clinically and statistically significant improvements in pain and function for patients with intra-articular hip pain, irrespective of the delivery method. Smoking history and female sex were independent predictors of increased pain associated with intra-articular hip joint injections.

AB  - Abstract No standard of care is currently recognized for treatment of canine prostatic carcinoma (PC). This retrospective study assesses outcome following definitive-intent, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (RT) in dogs with PC. Medical records review was performed, including 18 patients from four institutions undergoing definitive-intent intensity-modulated radiotherapy to treat PC. Diagnosis was incidental in 7/18 (39%) patients. Five dogs (28%) had evidence of metastasis to loco-regional lymph nodes at diagnosis. Seventeen patients received concurrent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; 15/18 (83%) patients received maximally-tolerated dose (MTD) chemotherapy, with variable drugs and protocols employed. Total prescribed radiation dose ranged from 48 to 54?Gy (median 50?Gy) delivered as daily doses of 2.5-2.8 Gy. One patient was euthanized prior to completing radiotherapy. Acute toxicity was observed in nine patients; Grade 1-2 diarrhoea was the most common toxicity observed. Suspected late toxicity (urethral stricture, ureteral stricture and hindlimb oedema) was observed in three patients. Median event-free survival (EFS) following RT was 220?days, and median overall survival was 563?days. Local progression occurred in seven patients at a median of 241?days. Median overall survival was significantly longer in incidentally diagnosed dogs (581 vs 220?days in symptomatic dogs, P = .042). EFS was significantly longer in patients treated with MTD chemotherapy (241 vs 25?days, P <?.001), and significantly shorter in patients presenting with evidence of metastatic disease (109?days) vs those without (388?days, P = .008). These findings suggest that definitive-intent radiotherapy is a valuable treatment option for local control of canine PC with moderate risk of toxicity.

These influences have occurred across all types of hazards (intentional, technological, and natural) and across all phases of comprehensive emergency management (mitigation, preparation, response, recovery). National Incident Management System (NIMS), issued by the US Department of Homeland Security in 2004 and revised in 2008 describes not only Incident Management Teams for direct management of the impacts of an incident but also describes Multiagency Coordination Systems (MACS). These concepts become increasingly important in effective public health and health care emergency response and are becoming more refined. Future roles and responsibilities are also explored, including the emerging concept of Emergency Public Health as a distinct discipline.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Intracavernosal injection (ICI) of a vasoactive agent has been an important part of the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) since its initial description by Virag in 1982. Aim To review the literature and summarize the use of ICI and its role in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of ED. Methods Literature review. Main Outcome Measure To define the role of ICI's utility in the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of ED. Results When used in conjunction with color penile Doppler ultrasound for ED evaluation and diagnosis, ICI helps to detect penile vascular abnormalities and allows for differentiation between the multiple vasculogenic causes of impotence, thus helping clinicians to select the optimal treatment modality for each patient. Patients utilizing ICI continue to report high efficacy and satisfaction rates relative to other treatment options despite ICI's designation as a second-line therapy since the introduction of oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in 1998. In recent years, ICI has also become an important part of penile rehabilitation programs following radical prostatectomy, as regular use of ICI is thought to increase the rate at which patients experience return of spontaneous erection through preservation of penile tissue integrity and prevention of corporeal smooth muscle atrophy. Conclusions ICI of vasoactive agents remains an important tool in treating and diagnosing ED, with high patient satisfaction and efficacy rates. However, the dropout rate for ICI therapy remains relatively high, and it may be associated with priapism, ecchymoses, hematoma formation, and penile fibrosis. Patients should be educated on the benefits and limitations of ICI therapy prior to beginning treatment in order to minimize dropout rates. Additional studies are necessary to better understand the possible long-term benefits of ICI therapy and how to most effectively structure the penile rehabilitation program after radical prostatectomy.

Aetiologies include: lymphadenopathy due to inflammation, malignancy and degenerative causes; soft tissue tumours such as haemangioma, lymphangioma, peripheral nerve sheath tumours and lipomas; post-surgical complications such as seroma, lymphocoele and haematoma; lesions arising in accessory breast tissue such as fibroadenoma and carcinoma. Some of these entities have distinctive imaging appearances knowledge of which can be helpful in suggesting the correct diagnosis.

AB  - We aim to review the characteristics and outcomes of all trauma team activated patients admitted to Queen Mary Hospital. Trauma registry data collected from January 1998 to December 2000 were analyzed in terms of demographics, resuscitative interventions, and progress. There were 351, 285 and 236 trauma admissions in 1998, 1999 and 2000 respectively, with an average 3:1 male:female ratio. Forty four percent of patients were in age group 21?40 years. Road traffic accidents were most frequent (46.4%) followed by Industrial (21.3%), then domestic accidents (15.5%). Head injury was the most common (60.8%) involved system; 40.1% sustained some form of extremity injury, whereas only 12.8% patients sustained abdominal injury. The appropriateness of trauma team activation was shown to have improved during the three-year period, but the trauma team response remained similar. A strong correlation was found between the Injury Severity Score with the final patient outcome. 50% patients were discharged directly home; 34.4% transferred to convalescence and 3.2% D.A.M.A. Mean hospital mortality was 11.2%. Analysis of the data has given us a better understanding of the patient population that we are facing and has lead us to important changes in the way we manage our trauma patients.

AB  - Low back pain is often associated with tensional changes in the paraspinal muscles detected by palpatory procedures. Shear wave elastography (SWE), recently introduced, allows the stiffness of muscles to be assessed noninvasively. The aim of this work was to study the feasibility of using SWE on the three main lumbar back muscles (multifidus, longissimus, and iliocostalis) in vivo after analyzing their muscular architecture ex vivo. We determined the orientation of fibers in the multifidus, longissimus, and iliocotalis muscles in seven fresh cadavers using gross anatomy and B-Mode ultrasound imaging. We then quantified the stiffness of these three muscles at the L3 level ex vivo and in 16 healthy young adults. Little pennation was observed in the longissimus and iliocostalis, in which the direction of fibers was almost parallel to the line of spinous processes. The multifidus appeared as a multiceps and multipennate muscle. Given the random layering of millimetric fascicles, tendons, and fatty spaces, the multifidus had multiple fiber orientations. Muscular fascicles and fibers were oriented from 9° to 22° to the line of spinous processes. The shear moduli related to stiffness were 6.9?±?2.7 kPa for the longissimus, 4.9?±?1.4 kPa for the iliocostalis, and 5.4?±?1.6 kPa for the multifidus. SWE is a feasible method for quantifying the stiffness of the lumbar back muscles. Clin. Anat. 30:774?780, 2017. ? 2017Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Key points Thermal and hypoxic stress commonly coexist in environmental, occupational and clinical settings, yet how the brain tolerates these multi-stressor environments is unknown Core cooling by 1.0°C reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) by 20?30% and cerebral oxygen delivery (CDO2) by 12?19% at sea level and high altitude, whereas core heating by 1.5°C did not reliably reduce CBF or CDO2 Oxygen content in arterial blood was fully restored with acclimatisation to 4330 m, but concurrent cold stress reduced CBF and CDO2 Gross indices of cognition were not impaired by any combination of thermal and hypoxic stress despite large reductions in CDO2 Chronic hypoxia renders the brain susceptible to large reductions in oxygen delivery with concurrent cold stress, which might make monitoring core temperature more important in this context Abstract Real-world settings are composed of multiple environmental stressors, yet the majority of research in environmental physiology investigates these stressors in isolation. The brain is central in both behavioural and physiological responses to threatening stimuli and, given its tight metabolic and haemodynamic requirements, is particularly susceptible to environmental stress. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF, duplex ultrasound), cerebral oxygen delivery (CDO2), oesophageal temperature, and arterial blood gases during exposure to three commonly experienced environmental stressors ? heat, cold and hypoxia ? in isolation, and in combination. Twelve healthy male subjects (27 ± 11 years) underwent core cooling by 1.0°C and core heating by 1.5°C in randomised order at sea level; acute hypoxia ( = 50 mm Hg) was imposed at baseline and at each thermal extreme. Core cooling and heating protocols were repeated after 16 ± 4 days residing at 4330 m to investigate any interactions with high altitude acclimatisation. Cold stress decreased CBF by 20?30% and CDO2 by 12?19% (both P < 0.01) irrespective of altitude, whereas heating did not reliably change either CBF or CDO2 (both P > 0.08). The increases in CBF with acute hypoxia during thermal stress were appropriate to maintain CDO2 at normothermic, normoxic values. Reaction time was faster and slower by 6?9% with heating and cooling, respectively (both P < 0.01), but central (brain) processes were not impaired by any combination of environmental stressors. These findings highlight the powerful influence of core cooling in reducing CDO2. Despite these large reductions in CDO2 with cold stress, gross indices of cognition remained stable.

AB  - The basis of ultrasound diagnosis of adnexal masses is the gray scale ultrasound image. In our prospective study of 173 patients scheduled for laparotomy because of an adnexal mass, an experienced examiner correctly discriminated between benign and malignant masses in 95% of cases on the basis of subjective evaluation of the gray scale ultrasound image (sensitivity 92%, i.e. 22/24, specificity 96%, i.e. 143/149). A correct specific diagnosis (e.g. dermoid cyst, endometrioma, etc.) was made in 72 of the 173 women, i.e. in 42%. Adding Doppler ultrasound examination to gray scale imaging did not change the diagnostic accuracy, but it increased the confidence (as rated on a visual analogue scale) with which a correct diagnosis was made in 14% of cases. Increased diagnostic confidence was observed most often in stage I ovarian malignancies (83%, i.e. 5/6). Doppler ultrasound examination was not helpfull in the diagnosis of borderline tumors. For less experienced ultrasound examiners the use of mathematical models to calculate an individual risk of malignancy might be an alternative to subjective evaluation of the the gray scale ultrasound image. In a study of 136 consecutive women scheduled for laparotomy because of an adnexal mass, two mathematical formulas were cross-validated prospectively: that of Tailor et al. (Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology 1997; 10?:?41?7) and that of Timmermann et al. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999; 181: 157?65). Both models performed less well than in the studies where they were created, the sensitivity and specificity of the first model being 71% and 82%, respectively, and the sensitivity and specificity of the second model 72% and 68%, respectively. Conclusion Subjective evaluation of the gray scale ultrasound image is an excellent method for discrimination between benign and malignant adnexal masses. Mathematical models hold promise but must be fine tuned on the basis of information from a very large number of tumors.

AB  - Purpose? Traumatic diaphragmatic herniae are an uncommon sequelae of abdominal trauma which present a significant diagnostic challenge, especially when unaccompanied by other intraabdominal injuries necessitating exploratory laparotomy. Laparoscopic repair is a relatively new and uncommon procedure, with the literature consisting almost entirely of isolated case reports and small case series. We present one of our own cases, and perform a quantitative analysis of the combined literature experience to date. Methodology? Cases reports of laparoscopic repair of traumatic diaphragmatic herniae were identified by a Medline literature search. Clinical findings, technical decisions and outcomes were correlated via database. Results? Data from 50 cases was available. There was no common standard method of repair although the majority (31/50) were accomplished without the use of mesh. The major complication rate was 4%, the overall complication rate was 16%. Defects greater than 10cm long were associated with a 41% rate of open conversion, versus 0% if less than 10cm. There were no recurrences described. Conclusion? Laparoscopic repair of traumatic diaphragmatic herniae enjoys a low rate of major complications, whilst avoiding the morbidity of open repair. Several technical points remain open to operator preference, and we invite discussion regarding the merits of each.
