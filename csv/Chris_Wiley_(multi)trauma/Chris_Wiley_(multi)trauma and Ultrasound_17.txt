AB  - Purpose? Traumatic diaphragmatic herniae are an uncommon sequelae of abdominal trauma which present a significant diagnostic challenge, especially when unaccompanied by other intraabdominal injuries necessitating exploratory laparotomy. Laparoscopic repair is a relatively new and uncommon procedure, with the literature consisting almost entirely of isolated case reports and small case series. We present one of our own cases, and perform a quantitative analysis of the combined literature experience to date. Methodology? Cases reports of laparoscopic repair of traumatic diaphragmatic herniae were identified by a Medline literature search. Clinical findings, technical decisions and outcomes were correlated via database. Results? Data from 50 cases was available. There was no common standard method of repair although the majority (31/50) were accomplished without the use of mesh. The major complication rate was 4%, the overall complication rate was 16%. Defects greater than 10cm long were associated with a 41% rate of open conversion, versus 0% if less than 10cm. There were no recurrences described. Conclusion? Laparoscopic repair of traumatic diaphragmatic herniae enjoys a low rate of major complications, whilst avoiding the morbidity of open repair. Several technical points remain open to operator preference, and we invite discussion regarding the merits of each.

AB  - Abstract Hepatic arterial pseudoaneurysm is a rare but potentially fatal condition that requires prompt management. We report a case of hepatic arterial pseudoaneurysm developed after radiofrequency ablation of a hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient was successfully treated with percutaneous absolute ethanol injection under ultrasound guidance. Follow-up studies with ultrasound and computed tomography for 2 years after treatment revealed no evidence of local recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma and of the pseudoaneurysm.

AB  - Objective To test the clinical and sonographic predictors of testicular torsion (TT) with the aim of reducing negative exploration rates. Patients and Methods We performed a prospective study of all boys treated for ?acute scrotum? at our institute between January 2001 and April 2012 and clinical findings were documented. If available, ultrasonography (US) was added to the diagnostic evaluation. A prediction of the diagnosis was based on clinical and sonographic features, and was followed by surgical exploration in all patients. Results A total of 104 patients were included in the 16-month period of the study. No single finding excluded TT. The clinical features (pain <24?h, nausea/vomiting, abnormal cremasteric reflex, high position of the testis) appeared predictive (100% sensitivity) and the clinical scoring system was proven to be reliable, reducing the negative exploration rate by >55%. Ultrasound predictors alone were not able to identify all boys with TT. Conclusions It is safe to refrain from routine surgical exploration in every child with acute scrotum if the clinical score is applied, which results in a marked reduction of negative explorations. A reliable diagnosis could not be obtained based on US alone. As scrotal US is unpleasant for the child, we propose to refrain from this if the clinical score is positive. Patients with a negative clinical score are suitable candidates for US to establish and secure diagnosis.

AB  - Abstract Background Steady increase in computed tomography (CT) utilisation in the ED was observed in countries such as the USA, Canada, China and Korea; however, limited empirical data are available regarding Taiwan. Objective The objective of the present study is to quantify and compare trends in CT utilisation in the ED over a 5 year period in a medical centre in Taiwan. Methods Electronic chart review was performed in a medical centre with an annual ED census of 80 000 patients. Subjects >20 years of age who underwent CT scans during ED visits from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2009 were identified. Results Among the 333 673 adult ED visits, 43 635 received CT scans, with a utilisation rate of 131 per 1000. Within the 5 year span, patient volume increased by 7.7%, whereas CT utilisation increased by 42.7%. The rates of increase in patient volume and CT utilisation were 5.0% and 32.4% in non-trauma; 19.7% and 97.8% in trauma. CT scans were mostly performed on the head (47%), abdomen (36%), followed by chest (10%) and miscellaneous (7%). An increase of 168% in spinal CTs for trauma patients was observed. An increase in CT utilisation was found in all age groups with a proportionate increase with increasing age in both trauma and non-trauma. Conclusion ED CT utilisation has increased at a rate far exceeding the growth in ED patient volume. This may be attributed to the improved utility of CT in diagnosing serious pathology, more diagnostic indications for CT, ready availability and the necessity for diagnostic certainty in the ED.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the accuracy of intestinal ultrasound for diagnosis of intestinal obstruction in dogs and cats. Methods: A prospective clinical study was performed. Inclusion criteria were dogs and cats with clinical signs suggestive of gastrointestinal obstruction. Animals with no obstruction detected on ultrasound were excluded if they could not be monitored for 48 hours to confirm absence of obstruction. Sonographic diagnosis of small intestinal obstruction was based on identification of at least two findings suggestive of intestinal obstruction. Results: Ninety-two patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction were included. Correct diagnosis of intestinal obstruction was made in 21 cases (23%), and in 68 (74%) this diagnosis was excluded. Interpretation of the images on prospective analysis had sensitivity, positive predictive, specificity and negative predictive values of 100%, 87.5%, 95.8% and 100%, respectively. Clinical Significance: Ultrasonography is an excellent method for investigation of animals with gastrointestinal disorders, and is particularly useful for excluding obstructive processes.

The aim of this paper is to review the existing literature regarding the Vector? method. Material and Methods: This review is based on a MEDLINE search of the use of Vector up to January 2008 (focused on in vitro findings, periodontal treatment, peri-implantitis therapy, clinical and microbiological data, and patient considerations). The MEDLINE search identified 128 papers, of which 18 were found to be relevant to this review. A hand search of the periodontal literature over the same period resulted in identification of a further 10 relevant papers. Conclusion: Vector? used for treatment of chronic periodontitis results in clinical and microbiological outcomes comparable to those achieved by manual instrumentation and conventional ultrasonic instruments. Vector? is less efficient when removing large masses of calculus, however, and cannot be recommended for the treatment of peri-implantitis. Vector may be particularly useful in periodontal maintenance care as it is well tolerated by patients and results in less removal of cementum than other instruments.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in significant inflammation which contributes to the evolving pathology. Previously, we have demonstrated that cyclic AMP (cAMP), a molecule involved in inflammation, is down-regulated after TBI. To determine the mechanism by which cAMP is down-regulated after TBI, we determined whether TBI induces changes in phosphodiesterase (PDE) expression. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats received moderate parasagittal fluid-percussion brain injury (FPI) or sham injury, and the ipsilateral, parietal cortex was analyzed by western blotting. In the ipsilateral parietal cortex, expression of PDE1A, PDE4B2, and PDE4D2, significantly increased from 30 min to 24 h post-injury. PDE10A significantly increased at 6 and 24 h after TBI. Phosphorylation of PDE4A significantly increased from 6 h to 7 days post-injury. In contrast, PDE1B, PD4A5, and PDE4A8 significantly decreased after TBI. No changes were observed with PDE1C, PDE3A, PDE4B1/3, PDE4B4, PDE4D3, PDE4D4, PDE8A, or PDE8B. Co-localization studies showed that PDE1A, PDE4B2, and phospho-PDE4A were neuronally expressed, whereas PDE4D2 was expressed in neither neurons nor glia. These findings suggest that therapies to reduce inflammation after TBI could be facilitated with targeted therapies, in particular for PDE1A, PDE4B2, PDE4D2, or PDE10A.

AB  - Objective To report the complications and outcome of dogs undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for uncomplicated gall bladder disease. Study Design Multi-institutional case series. Animals Client-owned dogs (n=20). Methods Medical records of dogs that underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy were reviewed and signalment, history, clinical and ultrasound examination findings, surgical variables, and complications were collated. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed using a multiport approach. Data were compared between dogs with successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy and dogs requiring conversion to open cholecystectomy. Results Six dogs (30%) required conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy due to inability to ligate the cystic duct (3), evidence of gall bladder rupture (1), leakage from the cystic duct during dissection (1), and cardiac arrest (1). Cystic duct dissection was performed in 19 dogs using an articulating dissector (10), right angle forceps (7), and unrecorded (2). The cystic duct was ligated in 15 dogs using surgical clips (5), suture (6), or a combination (4). All dogs were discharged from the hospital and had resolution of clinical signs, although 1 dog developed pancreatitis and 1 dog required revision surgery for bile peritonitis. There was no significant difference in preoperative blood analysis results, surgical technique, or duration of hospitalization between dogs undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and cases converted to open cholecystectomy. Conclusion Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed successfully for uncomplicated gall bladder disease in dogs after careful case selection. The surgeon considering laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be familiar with a variety of methods for cystic duct dissection and ligation to avoid difficulties during the procedure.

AB  - Study Type ? Therapy (case series)?Level of Evidence?4 What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? It is known that urorectal fistulae is a serious but rare complication of the treatment of carcinoma of the prostate. This study adds a distinction between post-surgical fistulate and post-irradiation fistulae. Essentially most post-surgical fistulae are simple and relatively easily dealt with: the expectation is that the patient will return to normality; whereas post-irradiation fistulate are by their nature complex and much more difficult to treat with a much more uncertain long-term outcome. Complexity is discussed and defined. OBJECTIVE ?? To evaluate the management of urorectal fistulae (URF) in light of new technology in prostate cancer treatment, which has changed the nature of these URF and, therefore, the approach to treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS ?? Between 2004 and 2009 we repaired URF after treatment for prostate cancer in 40 patients with a minimum of 1-year follow-up since their last intervention. ?? In 23 patients (post-surgical group) the URF resulted from open, laparoscopic or robotic radical prostatectomy. In the other 17 patients (post-irradiation group) the URF resulted from either external beam radiation (EBRT) or brachytherapy (BT), or both, salvage cryotherapy or salvage high-intensity focused ultrasound (sHIFU). ?? In the 23 patients in the post-surgical group a transperineal repair was performed. In the post-irradiation group a transperineal repair was performed in three of the 17 patients. A transabdominal or abdominoperineal repair was performed in the remaining 14 patients, combined with salvage radical prostatectomy in those eight patients in whom a discrete prostate still existed, and in whom this was possible. RESULTS ?? The URF were cured in all patients. ?? A bladder-neck contracture (BNC) developed in two patients, one of whom is being managed by interval dilatation and the other of whom had a revision of his vesico-urethral anastomosis. Sphincter weakness incontinence required further treatment in eight patients by implantation of an artificial urinary sphincter. ?? A specific category of complex URF with cavitation was identified, which is particularly common after sHIFU following the combination of previous EBRT and BT, but which may result from the sequential application of any ?new technology?. CONCLUSIONS ?? URF of any degree of complexity can be managed without the need for a transanorectal sphincter-splitting approach or a covering colostomy and without the need for an interposition flap when the circumstances are appropriate and the surgeon is sufficiently experienced. URF with cavitation and in the post-irradiation group are an exception and do require an interposition flap. ?? The role of salvage radical prostatectomy in patients with a URF who still have a prostate, needs to be defined. ?? We suggest that cavitation, BNC and extensive ischaemia due to the serial application of external energy sources confer ?complexity?. Post-surgical URF are simple except for those with cavitation or a BNC. Most post-irradiation URF are complex even in the absence of cavitation or a BNC.

AB  - Summary Acute pain follows surgery, diagnostic procedures, or trauma. In addition, there are many medical conditions that cause acute inflammatory pain. Acute pain after surgery or a diagnostic intervention is preventable with the pre-emptive use of analgesics. Acute pain from trauma cannot be pre-empted, and its treatment may require the use of combinations of drugs and larger dosages. The drugs used to treat acute pain can be divided into five main classes: opioids, local anesthetics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), α-2 adrenoceptor agonists, and miscellaneous drugs or adjuncts. Most opioids have minimal effects on the cardiovascular system and, consequently, are often used in protocols for dogs suffering from cardiovascular disease. The most common adverse effects reported are those associated with the gastrointestinal tract. Physical therapy techniques including passive range of motion, massage, ultrasound, low-level laser, and acupuncture can be useful adjuncts to pharmaceutical treatment of acute pain in dogs.

AB  - Background All endometrial sampling methods are invasive. Therefore in sympyomatic women and for women at risk of developing endometrial pathology in menopause a technique that could reduce the number of biopsy procedures would be of a great value. This technique would be relatively non-invasive, easy to learn and perform, cost effective and well accepted by the patients. The objective of this study was the assessment of the diagnostic potency of ultrasound measurements by comparison with the usual histological investigation. Method Endovaginal ultrasonography (measurement of endometrial thickness and morphology of endometrium) prior to endometrial sampling was done in 160 postmenopausal patients. 143 D&C, 15 hysteroscopies and 2 laparotomies were performed to collect endometrial tissue. Indications for endometrial sampling were bleeding in 72%, ultrasound suspicion of endometrium in 18%, or other (cervical or adnexal pathology) in 10% of patients. Sonohysterography, as an improvement over conventional ultrasound methods, was done in 12 cases (7.5%). Pathologic findings were compared to preoperative ultrasonography. Results Ultrasound measurement of endometrial thickness combined with morphology and sonohysterography detected more than 90% endometrial pathology (sensitivity 96%, specificity 92%). Conclusion We found endovaginal ultrasound as useful tool at identifying endometrial diseases in menopause. For a postmenopausal woman with vaginal bleeding with a 10% pretest probability of endometrial cancer, her probability of cancer is less than 1% following a normal endovaginal sonography and sonohysterography. Ultrasound should be considered as investigational and cannot be used as the only methods to evaluate abnormal bleeding in menopausal patients.

AB  - The purpose of the first study was to evaluate whether number and size of antral follicles can predict the outcome of IVF-ET. A total of 113 patients was prospectively included into this study. After 19?days of downregulation number and size of follicles were determined by using recent three dimensional transvaginal ultrasound (3-D) technology. We demonstrated that patients with a higher number of follicles between 5 and 10?mm showed a significantly higher pregnancy rate (PR), whereas patients with antral follicles >?11?mm have a higher cancellation rate due to ovarian low-response. Ultrasound visualization of the cumulus has been demonstrated years ago as an occasional finding during follicle scanning. It has never been proven, however, that cumulus-like intrafollicular structures as seen on ultrasound correlated with the recovery of mature oocytes. It was therefore our aim to investigate this possibility by using recent three-dimensional ultrasound (3-D) technology: Cumulus visualization by 3D ultrasound seems to be an indicator for mature oocytes and the fertilization rate. Follicles without visualization of the cumulus in all three planes are unlikely to contain mature, fertilizable oocytes. In the third part we wanted to evaluate the possibility of puncturing procedures under three-dimensional ultrasound control in close to real time using a new commercially available system, and to describe the technique. It will be demonstrated for follicle punctures that recent technology enables the carrying out of three-dimensional puncture procedures in real time; but this will be of more importance in other fields, e.g. in fetal medicine, oncology, and surgery.

AB  - What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Urethral strictures, bladder neck and posterior urethral contractures, and urorectal fistulation are three well-recognised complications of the treatment of prostate cancer, whether by surgery or non-surgical treatment. Because these are relatively rare problems the treatment is uncertain. There is a heavy reliance on endoscopic or instrumental management of urethral strictures and of bladder neck and posterior urethral contractures, and there is little discrimination in any of these conditions between those that are the result of surgery and those that are the result of radiotherapy and other treatment methods using external energy sources. This review aims to clarify out current understanding of these three clinical problems and draws attention to the role of reconstructive surgery, particularly when dealing with bladder neck contractures, prostatic urethral stenoses and urorectal fistula. This also shows that the nature of the problem, the recovery time after treatment and the degree of functional recovery is radically different in the surgical as against the non-surgical group, to a degree that the authors believe is not sufficiently stressed when patients are counselled and consented before their primary treatment. ?? To review the less common and not widely discussed, but much more serious complications of prostate cancer treatment of: urethral stricture, bladder neck contracture and urorectal fistula. ?? The treatment options for patients with organ-confirmed prostate cancer include: radical prostatectomy (RP), brachytherapy (BT), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), high-intensity focussed ultrasound (HIFU) and cryotherapy; with each method or combination of methods having associated complications. ?? Complications resulting from RP are relatively easy to manage, with rapid recovery and return to normal activities, and usually a return to normal bodily functions. ?? However, after non-surgical treatments, i.e. BT, EBRT, HIFU and cryotherapy, these same problems are more difficult to treat with a much slower return to a much lower level of function. ?? When counselling patients about the primary treatment of prostate cancer they should be advised that although the same type of complication may occur after surgical or non-surgical treatment, the scope and scale of that complication, the ease with which it is treated and the degree of restoration of normality after treatment, is altogether in favour of surgery in those for whom surgery is appropriate and who are fit for surgery.

AB  - Abstract Background Evaluation of skin condition on the basis of parametrization and objective measurements of the parameters has become obligatory. The aim of this study was to assess sex-related changes in skin topography and structure using the skin testing equipment. Materials and Methods The study was carried out on the group of 40 volunteers (20 females and 20 males) of the mean age 24 ± 3 years. The skin parameters were measured using 3 devices: Visioscan? VC 98 (skin topography), Visioline? VL 650 (skin macro relief) and Ultrascan UC22 (ultrasound imaging of the skin). All measurements were performed on the inner part of the left forearm. Results The skin parameters measured revealed significant differences in skin surface and structure between females and males. The skin of all women subjects was more homogenous in its structure with the presence of more abundant superficial skin lines and wrinkles in comparison to male skin. The higher number of skin furrows in the skin of women is in agreement with literature reports claiming that men's skin has lower number of wrinkles which are deeper and more pronounced. Ultrasound imaging of the skin indicated greater thickness and lower density of the dermis of men subjects compared to those of females. Conclusion Non-invasive methods of skin testing using new and advanced equipment have provided a possibility of objective parametrization and evaluation of sex-related changes in skin topography and structure.

AB  - Objectives To compare the use a simplified ultrasound based infertility investigation of the infertile couple with the current use of laparoscopy and hysteroscopy. Study design Thirty-three infertile couples underwent transvaginal ultrasound and hystero-salpingo-contrast-sonography. A diagnosis was formulated based on the results of the ultrasound investigations, a semen analysis and endocrine parameters. The following day all subjects underwent a laparoscopic chrompertubation and hysteroscopy by a surgeon unaware of the ultrasound findings. A diagnosis based on the findings at laparoscopy and hysteroscopy, the same semen analysis and endocrine parameters, was then made. The two diagnoses were compared. Results A 90.9% agreement was found between the diagnoses made from the two methods used. When considering laparoscopic diagnosis the Gold Standard of tubal patency, the sensitivity to diagnose occluded tubes using hystero-contrast-sonography was 92.8%. The corresponding figures for specificity, PPV and NPV were 96.2%, 92.8% and 98.1%, respectively. Conclusions A simple, ultrasound based approach to investigate the infertile couple, can be used effectively as an initial examination modality during the couple's work-up. However, there is a need for a larger study to confirm these results.

AB  - Background:? According to The American Pain Society, pain should be considered a fifth vital sign. Pain is a prominent feature of venous leg ulcerations (VLUs). Sixty-five percent of VLU patients complain of severe pain. In several multicenter clinical trials, Apligraf, a bioengineered living skin construct, has been shown to accelerate healing in venous leg ulcerations. Anecdotal clinical observations suggest that Apligraf treatment is associated with pain relief. A treatment modality which promotes healing and reduces pain would significantly improve the quality of life in patients with VLU. Methods:? VLU patients with pain scores greater than 5/10 on a numerical scale or requiring narcotic analgesia were randomized to receive either Apligraf and compression or compression alone. There was a 3-week ?wash-out? period to ensure that pain was not due to other factors such as inadequate compression or infection. Patients were enrolled only after a negative quantitative biopsy. The intensity of pain was self-scored and a quality-of-life questionnaire was completed at each visit. Weekly wound area measurements were obtained with digital planimetry. Results:? Thus far in the enrollment period we have already seen a trend toward a significant reduction in pain in the Apligraf group. This pain relief occurs shortly after application indicating that a mechanism distinct from clinical healing. The Apligraf group also demonstrated acceleration in wound healing as well as a decreased time-to-complete closure. Conclusion:? Interval analysis of this multicenter trial suggests that Apligraf accelerates wound healing and reduces the pain associated with venous leg ulcerations. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Abstract Objective: To assess the safety and efficacy of direct stenting using the sirolimus-eluting BX Velocity? stent in patients with coronary lesions. Background: Although direct coronary stenting has become a widespread practice, there have been no systematic assessments of direct stenting with drug-eluting stents. Methods: Total of 225 patients with identical inclusion and exclusion criteria as the original SIRIUS trial were enrolled in this prospective single-arm study. They were compared in a no-inferiority design with 412 similar patients from the SIRIUS trial who had sirolimus-eluting stents deployed after predilatation and were preassigned to angiographic follow-up evaluation. Results: Direct stenting was successful in 85.8% of the patients. Compared with the predilatation group, direct stenting was associated with shorter median procedure duration (33 min vs. 45 min, P < 0.001). Angiographic follow-up at 8 months revealed similar late loss (in-stent?0.19 ± 0.47 mm vs. 0.17 ± 0.44 mm, and in-lesion?0.23 ± 0.41 mm vs. 0.24 ± 0.47 mm) and similar frequency of binary restenosis (in-stent?4.6% vs. 3.2% and in-lesion?6.1% vs. 8.9%) between the two treatment strategies. However, stent-edge restenosis was lower with direct stenting than in the predilatation control group (2.1% vs. 6.9%, P = 0.02). At 12-months, there were no significant differences in target lesion revascularization (3.7% vs. 5.1%, P = ns) or composite major adverse cardiac events (7.0% vs. 8.3%, P = ns). Conclusions: In patients similar to those treated in the SIRIUS trial, direct stenting using sirolimus-eluting stents achieves excellent short- and long-term clinical and angiographic results with shorter procedure time and less frequent stent edge restenosis compared with predilation stent implantation techniques. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Severe variants of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) affect <2% of all FOP patients worldwide, but provide an unprecedented opportunity to probe the phenotype?genotype relationships that propel the pathology of this disabling disease. We evaluated two unrelated children who had severe reduction deficits of the hands and feet with absence of nails, progressive heterotopic ossification, hypoplasia of the brain stem, motor and cognitive developmental delays, facial dysmorphology, small malformed teeth, and abnormal hair development. One child had sensorineural hearing loss, microcytic anemia, and a tethered spinal cord and the other had a patent ductus arteriosus and gonadal dysgenesis with sex reversal (karyotype 46, XY female). Both children had an identical mutation in ACVR1 c.772A>G; p.Arg258Gly (R258G), not previously described in FOP. Although many, if not most, FOP mutations directly perturb the structure of the GS regulatory subdomain and presumably the adjacent αC helix, substitution with glycine at R258 may directly alter the position of the helix in the kinase domain, eliminating a key aspect of the autoinhibitory mechanism intrinsic to the wild-type ACVR1 kinase. The high fidelity phenotype?genotype relationship in these unrelated children with the most severe FOP phenotype reported to date suggests that the shared features are due to the dysregulated activity of the mutant kinase during development and postnatally, and provides vital insight into the structural biology and function of ACVR1 as well as the design of small molecule inhibitors. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
