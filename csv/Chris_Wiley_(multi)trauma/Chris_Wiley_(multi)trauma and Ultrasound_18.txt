AB  - Abstract Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate clinically the immediate effect of trauma from instrumentation after scaling and root planing with different instruments. Material and Methods: Ten subjects with moderate chronic periodontitis, presenting probing depths ranging from 3.5 to 6.5?mm on anterior teeth, upper and/or lower, were selected. Teeth were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: MC group ? scaled and planed with Gracey mini-curettes (MiniFiveTM); CC group ? scaled and planed with Gracey conventional curettes. The selected teeth were probed with a computerized electronic probe, guided by an occlusal stent, and then subjected to scaling and root planing. Immediately following instrumentation, teeth were probed again. The difference between relative attachment level (RAL) immediately before and after instrumentation was considered as trauma from instrumentation. Results: Intra-group analysis revealed statistically significant differences between RAL immediately before and after instrumentation in both groups (0.68±0.32 for MC group; and 0.83±0.41 for CC group ?p<0.05). However, inter-group analysis did not show a statistically significant difference in trauma from instrumentation caused by the different instruments. Conclusions: Within the limits of this study, it was concluded that root instrumentation causes an average trauma from instrumentation of 0.76?mm with no differences between the tested instruments.

AB  - In North America second trimester genetic ultrasound is offered to patients at risk for trisomy 21 and other chromosomal abnormalities who decline invasive testing. In most major studies in which the prevalence of ultrasound markers used for genetic ultrasound are reported, congenital heart defects are identified in less than 10% of fetuses. When one considers that over 50% of fetuses with trisomy 21 and 90% of fetuses with trisomies 13 and 18 have structural malformations of the heart, the question should be raised as to why the wide discrepancy in prevalence and detection rate of heart defects in these fetuses. The purpose of this presentation is to review the prevalence of CHD in fetuses with trisomy 21, trisomies 13 and 18, and all fetuses with chromosomal defects that were identified following second trimester amniocentesis. To ascertain the presence or absence of CHD, each fetus underwent a fetal echocardiographic study using real-time and color Doppler ultrasound at the time of genetic amniocentesis. The results of the study demonstrated the following: The detection rate for trisomy 21 (n?=?80) increased from 62% to 91% when examination of the fetal heart was performed. The detection rate for trisomy 18 (n?=?30) increased from 84%% to 97% when the cardiovascular system was evaluated. For fetuses with any chromosomal abnormality (n?=?103) advanced maternal age were examined, the examination of the heart increased the detection rate from 61% to 85%. Given the above findings, the inclusion of the fetal echocardiographic evaluation of the fetus significantly increased the detection rate for the above three groups of fetuses. If physicians and/or sonographers desire to increase the ultrasound detection rate for chromosomal abnormalities, examination of the fetal cardiovascular system must occur.

AB  - There is a potential role of ultrasound examination in the management of women with postmenopausal (PMP) bleeding. Because women with an endometrium = 4?mm at transvaginal ultrasound examination rarely have endometrial pathology, it may be justified not to sample their endometrium. However, endometrial pathology is common among women with endometrium = 5?mm. In our prospective study, 105 consecutive women with PMP bleeding and endometrium = 5?mm underwent hydrosonography, hysteroscopy, D  Kappa 0.77), but neither hysteroscopy nor hydrosnography could reliably discriminate between benign and malignant lesions. In a randomized trial, 49 women with PMP bleeding and endometrium = 4?mm were randomized to D & C and 48 to ultrasound follow up. 14 (29%) women in the D & C group and 22 (46%) in the ultrasound group had either rebleeding or manifested endometrial growth during a 12-month follow-up period. Endometrial pathology was not found in women with rebleeding unless the endometrium was?=?5?mm. Conclusion Women with PMP bleeding and endometrium = 5?mm should undergo hydrosnography. If focal lesions are detected hysteroscopic resection should be carried out. In women with PMP bleeding, rebleeding during the first 12?months is an indication to sample the endometrium only if the endometrium measures = 5?mm at ultrasound examination.

AB  - Summary Sonography is one of the diagnostic imaging modalities that can be used to image intra-abdominal organs. This chapter discusses some abdominal organs such as the gallbladder that are better evaluated with ultrasound than with CT; as such, ultrasound is the first line imaging modality in the evaluation of suspected gallbladder pathology. It reviews typical sonographic appearances of common benign and malignant liver masses. In patients with inflammatory conditions of the bowel or mesentery, such as appendicitis, Crohn's disease, or mesenteric adenitis, enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes may be visualized with ultrasound. The three major vessels interrogated during liver Doppler ultrasound are the hepatic arteries, portal veins, and hepatic veins. Spectral Doppler interrogation of the main portal vein demonstrates hepatofugal flow compatible with portal hypertension. Secondary sclerosing cholangitis may also occur from prior inflammatory processes of the biliary tree such as choledocholithiasis.

AB  - Summary We report the successful use of a stellate ganglion block as part of a multi-modal postoperative analgesic regimen. Four patients scheduled for orthopaedic surgery following upper limb trauma underwent blockade of the stellate ganglion pre-operatively under ultrasound guidance. Patients reported excellent postoperative analgesia, with postoperative VAS pain scores between 0 and 2, and consumption of morphine in the first 24 h ranging from 0 to 14?mg. While these are preliminary findings, and must be confirmed in a clinical trial, they highlight the potential for stellate ganglion blockade to provide analgesia following major upper limb surgery.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to provide clinical evidence of the use of contrast-enhanced sonography in detecting and quantifying changes in intraneural vascularity due to median mononeuropathy. Methods Five Macaca fascicularis monkeys were exposed to 20 weeks of repetitive work to increase their risk of developing median mononeuropathy. Contrast-enhanced sonograms were obtained in 30-second increments for 7 minutes while a contrast agent was being delivered. Data were collected immediately at the conclusion of the 20-week work exposure and then again during a recovery phase approximately 3 months after the completion of work. Quantitative analysis and trend graphs were used to analyze median nerve perfusion intensity. This study also compared the use of both manual counting of pixels and semiautomatic measurement using specialized software. Results Based on the average data, maximum intensity values were identified as the best indicators of nerve hyperemia. Paired t tests demonstrated significantly higher maximum intensities in the working stage for 4 of the 5 subjects (P < .01). Conclusions This study provides preliminary evidence that (1) in a controlled exposure model, a change in intraneural vascularity of the median nerve between working and recovery can be observed; (2) this vascular change can be measured using an objective technique that quantifies the intensity of vascularity; and (3) contrast-enhanced sonography may improve the ability to reliably capture and measure low-flow microvascularity.

AB  - We present a clinical case of treatment and neurorehabilitation of a patient with severe neurological deficit due to extensive traumatic lesion of the left hemisphere of the brain. Until recently, such cases were considered incurable and remained marginalized throughout their lives. This clinical case illustrates the compensatory brain possibilities under long-term integrated multidisciplinary treatment and neurorehabilitation with mandatory application of medical, medico-psychological, medico-pedagogical, and medico-social methods, the importance and intensity of which vary at different stages of the disease. This process is addressed in the individual patient. The greatest efficiency of the neurorehabilitation treatment of patients with severe consequences of a stroke and traumatic brain injury can be reached under the following conditions: the earliest possible start of rehabilitation with a sufficient duration and intensity; interdisciplinary and integrative rehabilitation process at various stages of rehabilitation treatment; systematic clinical and neuropsychological diagnostics; systematic monitoring of somatic, neurological, psychiatric, and psychological condition of the patient; assistance with sociopsychological and labor issues; and problem-solving support.

AB  - Background Thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) is considered the gold standard for hemithoracic regional anaesthesia. Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a new posterior thoracic wall block. Multiple-injection costotransverse block (MICB) mimics TPVB but with injection points within the thoracic intertransverse tissue complex and posterior to the superior costotransverse ligament. We aimed to compare the spread of injectate into the thoracic paravertebral space (TPVS) resulting from single-injection ESPB and MICB, respectively, with TPVB. Methods Ten soft-embalmed cadavers were utilised. In five cadavers, the right hemithorax was randomly allocated either to ultrasound-guided single-injection ESPB or single-injection TPVB; vice versa on the other side. In another five cadavers, the right hemithorax was randomly allocated either to ultrasound-guided MICB or multiple-injection TPVB. About 20 mL of dye was injected in each hemithorax with all techniques. Results With TPVB, the dye was consistently present in the TPVS with concomitant epidural spread in the majority of cases. The injectate spread into the TPVS with ESPB (60%) and MICB (100%). MICB consistently stained the ventral rami (T1-7), communicating rami and thoracic sympathetic trunk without epidural spread. Dissection after MICB revealed dye spread into the TPVS via the costotransverse foramina and along the dorsal branches of the posterior intercostal veins. Conclusions Consistent spread of dye into the TPVS colouring the ventral rami, the communicating rami, and the sympathetic trunk was observed with MICB; in this respect equivalent to TPVB. ESPB exhibited only partial success and was not equivalent to TPVB. No epidural spread was found with neither MICB nor ESPB.

AB  - Background This study was undertaken to evaluate the accuracy of transvaginal ultrasound combined with vaginal and endometrial cytology in detecting endometrial pathology in postmenopausal women. Method In all patients who underwent dilatation and curettage (D & C) for postmenopausal bleeding during four years endometrial thickness, vaginal and endometrial cytology were evaluated. Results Accuracy of endometrial thickness in detecting pathologic condition, like as polyp, hyperplasia and carcinoma was high sensitive but with low specificity. Combined use transvaginal ultrasound, vaginal and endometrial cytology show very high sensitivity and specificity for endometrial cancer. The combined use of three diagnostic methods show no benefit for other pathologic conditions. Conclusion Combination of transvaginal ultrasound, vaginal and endometrial cytology can not absolutely replace histologic findings obtained by D & C. However, in the cases with thin endometrium and negative cytology D & C could be avoided. Usefulness of these three methods has to be found in providing more information resulting in better understanding of endometrial condition.

AB  - Abstract The aim of this report was to review retrospectively the management of splenic trauma at a major Australian tertiary referral centre (Westmead Hospital) over a 10 year period. Forty-nine patients (0-15 years of age) with documented blunt splenic trauma were identified. The causes of splenic injury were road trauma (73%) and falls (27%). There were 22 minor injuries (Injury severity score [ISS] <16) and 27 severe injuries (ISS ≥16). All nine deaths were related to road trauma (mean ISS = 59). The investigation most commonly used was CT scanning (47%). Peritoneal lavage was performed in six patients (12%). Management involved non-operative care in 29 patients (57%), exploratory laparotomy alone in 5 (10%), splenic salvage in 2 (4%) and splenectomy in 13 (26%). This experience supports the view that non-operative management of splenic injury in haemodynamically stable children is safe and is the preferred treatment. Experienced assessment and meticulous observation is necessary. Laparotomy is indicated if there is continuing haemodynamic instability despite resuscitation. Operative management is aimed at splenic salvage with splenectomy being reserved for uncontrolled haemorrhage.

AB  - A mixed breed dog presented with diffuse unilateral hind limb swelling, which ultrasound and cytology confirmed to be caused by severe haematoma formation. Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography allowed distinct visualisation of an anomalous segment of the proximal popliteal artery, the presumed origin of the self-sustaining haematoma. Histopathology classified the malformed vessel as a haemangioendothelioma, a neoplasia of intermediate malignancy. Considering this as differential diagnosis to a neoplastic vascular alteration of high malignancy (such as haemangiosarcoma) might alter choice of treatment in future cases with similar clinical and imaging findings.

AB  - Abstract High-resolution ultrasonography with small part probes was performed on 20 proliferative vascular lesions of the skin (3 lymphangiomas, 9 hemangiomas, 8 Kaposi sarcomas). All the lesions were submitted to histological examination. The histological cuts were made in the same planes as the ultrasound scans in order to obtain a direct comparison. The sonographic pattern of each histotype is characteristic and correlated with the corresponding histological picture. Lymphangiomas appear as large anechoic communicating cavities; hemangiomas have small hypoechoic areas separated by thin hyperechoic septa. Kaposi sarcomas possess a mixed sonographic structure with ill-defined margins. Ultrasound is proposed as a simple and harmless diagnostic aid to clinical examination of proliferative vascular lesions of the skin.

AB  - Abstract Forty-six patients with pyogenic liver abscess have been treated at Paul Brousse Hospital between 1966 and 1986. The overall mortality was 24 per cent, all 11 deaths occurring in 24 patients seen prior to 1978 when there was often a considerable delay in the diagnosis of liver abscess (mean 90 ± 71 days). In seven patients the diagnosis was not made until post-mortem examination. The mainstay of treatment was surgical drainage. Since 1978 high resolution imaging techniques for the liver, and in particular ultrasound, have been available. The diagnostic delay has been significantly reduced (mean 28±20 days, P<0.01). Patients are receiving definitive treatment at an earlier stage in the evolution of the disease process, with fewer established complications prior to treatment (P < 0.05). Percutaneous drainage under ultrasound control is the preferred initial drainage procedure in high-risk patients. There have been no deaths in 22 patients treated for pyogenic liver abscess since 1978 (P<0.001).

AB  - Abstract Background. The objective of this article was to study the role of high frequency ultrasound and color Doppler imaging in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with cervical lymphadenopathy. Methods. The present study was carried out over a period of 18 months and included 64 patients of different age groups presenting with cervical lymphadenopathy. Comprehensive sonographic examination of the neck for cervical lymph nodes was performed using the LOGIQ 500 ultrasound machine (GE Wipro Proseries). The scanning was performed with the patient in the supine position, and with the neck hyperextended using a pad or pillow under the shoulders in order to provide optimum exposure of the neck. The parameters considered in this study included: site, mean long axis (L), mean short axis (S), shape index (S/L), echotexture and homogenicity, margins, ancillary features like calcification, necrosis, posterior enhancement, matting and surrounding tissue changes, vascular pattern, and mean arterial resistive index (RI). These findings were correlated with fine-needle aspiration cytology and excisional biopsy. The nodes were classified as reactive, lymphomatous, and metastatic. The results were subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS software. A p value of <.05 was considered to be significant. Results. The results showed that malignant lymph nodes, especially metastatic nodes, are mostly accompanied with rounded shape, homogenous echotexture, peripheral vascularity, and significantly high RI. Among these sonographic findings, nodal shape (S/L ratio) and RI were more accurate for differentiating benign from malignant lymph nodes. Most of the malignant nodes had well-defined borders. Calcification, necrosis, posterior enhancement, matting, and hilar flow patterns were characteristically found in tubercular lymphadenitis. A combined ultrasound-guided and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) diagnosis had a high sensitivity (95.4%) and specificity (92.3) as compared with situations in which they were used alone. Conclusion. Sonographic findings have a high accuracy in differentiating benign from malignant cervical lymph nodes. An ultrasound scan can be used as the first-line imaging tool in the diagnostic evaluation of cervical lymphadenopathy, especially in developing countries like India due to its ease, noninvasiveness, reproducibility, and cost effectiveness. It can also be used as an imaging tool for the guided aspirations. However, because of some overlapping in sonographic appearances of benign and malignant nodes, this modality may not have definite diagnostic values. But when combined with FNA, it has a very high sensitivity and specificity. ? 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck, 2010

AB  - Background Hospital readmissions due to illness among geriatric patients result in human suffering and psychological trauma. Resilience in chronic illness protects geriatric patients from outcomes of trauma leads to psychological and physical well-being and enables bouncing back to life. While communication has been linked to improved health outcomes, little is known about communication pathways in the context of postdischarge resilience. Aim and objective To explore the role of communication pathways that acute-care clinicians used with geriatric patients in postdischarge resilience. Methodological design and justification Participants were ten geriatric patients who were readmitted several times in the past year. Twenty narrative interviews were conducted, one upon discharge and the other a month thereafter. Data for each phase of interviews were analysed using methods of selection mechanisms and Bricolage. Ethical issues The ethics committee approved the study. Participants signed an informed-consent form for participation and publication. Findings Communication in acute care that enhanced health literacy, perceived control and reflection, contributed to higher comprehensibility and manageability during the hospitalisation and postdischarge meaningfulness postdischarge, contributing resilience. Participants who experienced other forms of communication demonstrated anxiety and helplessness with lingering psychological trauma postdischarge. Conclusions Acute care may provide clinicians with opportunities to alleviate the suffering of geriatric patients and contribute to their postdischarge resilience. The suggested T.E.R model delineates communication pathways to fuel the trajectory from psychological trauma to postdischarge resilience in practice.

AB  - The radiographic appearance of nodular fat necrosis is described in ten cats and one dog. The most common radiographic sign was the presence of a focal mineralized circular to oval soft tissue mass in the abdominal fat as present in 9 cats. These masses had a distinct eggshell-like rim encapsulating the lesion. In one cat and one dog multiple masses were present, without radiographic signs of mineralization. Abdominal ultrasound was performed in three cats and one dog, findings included the presence of hyperechoic masses with associated acoustic shadowing, some with a hypoechoic centre. Almost all animals were old and obese. In three cats and one dog, changes were confirmed with biopsy or post mortem examination. Lesions having the appearance of those in this paper are most likely incidental findings and should not be confused with abdominal masses of neoplastic origin. Ultrasound can be helpful in identifying such lesions.

AB  - Summary The knee is the largest and most complex joint in the body and a wide variety of bone and soft tissue injuries are seen in the knee. Trauma to the knee can result in injury to the bone, articular cartilage, meniscus and ligaments. Fractures of the proximal tibia, particularly those that extend into the knee joint, are serious injuries that frequently result in functional impairment. Recent advances in cross-sectional imaging, particularly in computed tomography (CT), have given this modality a prominent role in the detection and classification of fractures in and around the knee. With the advent of high-performance multi-detector CT, isotropic data sets can be generated with subsecond gantry rotation times and submillimetre slice thickness. CT arthrography can clearly demonstrate many lesions in the plethora of internal derangement of the knee. CT arthrography also deserves its advantage as it may be used to evaluate knee injuries in patients where magnetic resonance imaging is contraindicated. In this article we discuss the indications for imaging of knee injuries by CT, present the advantages of multi-detector CT and CT arthrography, and provide examples that highlight the utility of CT in the evaluation of the knee injuries.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: While descriptions of the visible soft tissues of the femorotibial joints exist for both arthroscopy and ultrasonography, there are few examples in the literature that discuss in detail the combined findings of these modalities. Objectives: To further elucidate the ultrasonographic and arthroscopic boundaries of the normal equine femorotibial joints and improve the understanding of the benefits and limitations of each individual modality. Methods: Simultaneous arthroscopy and ultrasonography were performed in 10 equine cadaver stifles as well as bilateral stifles on a horse that underwent nonrecovery surgery. The arthroscopic probe was visualised ultrasonographically and concurrent video and still images acquired. Results: Arthroscopy provided good visualisation of the cranial meniscal ligaments, the distal portion of the cranial cruciate ligament, proximal portion of the medial collateral ligament within the fibrous tissue of the joint capsule and a limited view of the abaxial border of meniscus. Ultrasonography allowed for almost complete visualisation of the menisci, collateral ligaments and cranial meniscal ligaments and a portion of the cranial cruciate ligament. Conclusions: By comparing the ultrasonographically and arthroscopically visible structures, this study allowed for a more complete understanding of the advantages and limitations of each modality. The ability of ultrasonography to resolve mild pathological changes should be further explored. Potential relevance: When used together, these modalities can provide a more global image of the femorotibial joints.
