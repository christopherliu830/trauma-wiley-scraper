AB  - Venous insufficiency is the most common cause of leg ulcers in the United States. Venous leg ulcers cost the health care system billions of dollars annually, and healing rates are less than 70% with standard of care; therefore, new therapies are needed to increase healing times and minimize associated costs. Non contact ultrasound therapy has been used to treat a variety of chronic wounds including venous leg ulcers, and it is thought that ultrasound has an effect on decreasing the bacterial count in wounds, although the exact mechanism of action of ultrasound is yet to be determined. We conducted an open labelled pilot study of 10 refractory venous ulcers of large size to determine the effect of non contact ultrasound on wound closure, bacterial counts, expression of inflammatory cytokines and pain reduction. We lacked a sham control group but we compared the baseline and end of treatment assessments and noted the differences. We found a significant reduction in wound area (P = 0·0039) over the 4-week treatment period. We also found a decline in individual and total bacterial counts; however, these differences were not significant. For all patients, there was also a trend toward reduced inflammatory cytokine expression compared with baseline levels; however, this reduction did not reach statistical significance. Interestingly, there was a correlation between healing and change in cytokine expression, which showed statistically significance for tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-αP = 0·0395, IL-1a P = 0·0351, IL-6 P = 0·0508, IL-8 P = 0·0990. Pain as measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS) was reduced from 4 at the baseline to 2·7 by the end of the study. In conclusion, we found that patients treated with ultrasound therapy and compression therapy show clinical improvement over the course of 4 weeks and had a decrease in inflammatory cytokines, bacterial counts and pain.

AB  - Contrast-enhanced ultrasound was used to study focal and multifocal lesions of the spleen in 26 dogs and two cats affected by 11 benign and 18 malignant splenic diseases. A second-generation microbubble contrast medium (Sonovue) was injected into the cephalic vein and enhancement patterns were subjectively described and time intensity curves calculated. Final diagnosis was obtained by histopathologic examination after splenectomy (n=19) or by needle aspiration and sonographic follow-up after 4 and 8 weeks (n=9). Contrast-enhanced ultrasound parameters, improving the characterization between benign and malignant lesions, were established. The most useful criterion was the hypoechogenicity of the lesion in the wash-out phase combined with the presence of tortuous feeding vessels, which was observed in association with malignancy. All malignant lesions were hypoechoic to the surrounding spleen 30?s after starting the contrast medium injection. Lymphosarcoma and hemangiosarcoma had characteristic perfusion patterns. Lymphosarcoma had rapid time to peak and early wash-out phase with a honeycomb pattern during the wash-out. Hemangiosarcomas were large nonperfused masses in all phases surrounded by hypervascular splenic parenchyma. Benign lesions except one hematoma and a benign histiocytoma had the same perfusion pattern as the surrounding spleen. Ultrasonographic and contrast-enhanced ultrasound findings of an accessory spleen are reported. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound can improve the characterization of focal or multifocal lesions of the spleen.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) is a rapidly growing area, providing physicians with a valuable diagnostic tool for patient assessment. This paper describes a collaborative model, utilising radiology department ultrasound expertise, to train and credential physicians in PoCUS. A 6-year experience of the implementation and outcomes of the programme established within the emergency departments of a large, multi-campus hospital network are presented. Methods A collaborative model was initially developed and implemented between radiology and emergency departments. Key elements of the programme included hospital executive support, close collaboration with stakeholders, resource allocation, appointment of a sonographer educator, clear scope of practise and robust quality processes. Results Participation grew from 36 emergency physicians in 2011 to 96 physicians in 2016. A total 11064 scans were logged with the programme in the 6-year period. Routine quality audit of 61.8% (6836/11064) of all scans included 2836 Focussed Assessment by Sonography in Trauma (FAST) and 1422 Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) examinations. False-positive or false-negative diagnoses occurred in 3.6% (102/2836) FAST and 1.3% (19/1422) AAA cases. No adverse clinical outcomes were reported to involve programme-compliant scans. Conclusion A collaborative model to train and credential physicians in PoCUS has been successfully implemented. The programme grew significantly, produced excellent quality outcomes and resolved many issues of potential conflict related to PoCUS.

AB  - Summary Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is intended to rapidly assess patients when access to other diagnostic imaging modalities is limited. The advantage of POCUS is that clinicians can use real-time images rather than images recorded and reported by a sonographer or a radiologist, thus allowing immediate correlation of findings with signs and symptoms. Defining POCUS curricula appropriate to specific low resource settings will be important for targeted allocation of training resources. Bedside assessment of deep venous thrombosis is one of the most useful POCUS applications as it is easy to perform, and has immediate therapeutic consequences. As face-to-face POCUS training modules are by definition short and the trainer is usually only available for a short period of time, methods to ensure continuous support and quality assurance need to be considered when designing or implementing training. A POCUS protocol is therefore frequently used in trauma patients and is well established.

Diagnostic (exploratory cohort)?Level of Evidence?2b INTRODUCTION To prospectively evaluate the accuracy of transvesical contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) as an alternative method for the detection of anastomotic leakage after radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) in comparison with the current standard method of conventional retrograde cystography (CG). PATIENTS AND METHODS Forty-three patients underwent RRP for histologically proven localized prostate cancer. The vesico-urethral anastomosis was evaluated 8 days after RRP by CG and CEUS. Any peri-anastomotic leakage was assessed and determined in CG and CEUS as follows: no extravasation (EV), small leakage (≤0.5?cm), moderate leakage (>0.5?cm to ≤2?cm), large leakage (>2?cm diameter of EV seen). RESULTS In total, 21 (49%) patients showed a watertight anastomosis. Ten (23%), two (4.7%) and ten (23%) patients showed a small, intermediate and large EV, respectively. In 31 cases (72%) there was 100% agreement of CG and CEUS for detection of no, moderate and large EV, respectively. In nine cases a small and in two cases a moderate EV was categorized as watertight anastomosis by CEUS. Only in one case did CG detect a small EV where a large EV was detected in CEUS. The agreement between both methods was 95% for detecting absence or large leakages. CONCLUSION CEUS is a promising imaging modality that seems to be equivalent to CG for detecting the presence of a large anastomotic leakage that is clinically relevant for postoperative persistence of the indwelling catheter. CEUS could be a cheap and time-saving alternative to the CG without exposure of the patient to radiation.

AB  - Background Limited data Exists ? on the Australian epidemiology of renal trauma, with very few studies published in the literature. The authors aim to detail the trends of renal trauma in the coastal city of the Gold Coast. Methods Retrospective data collection yielded 81 patients who sustained renal trauma from our 3-year period. Data included information on demographics, mechanism, American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) grade, presence of haematuria, associated injuries, management, and complications. Results Male patients accounted for 83% (n = 67) of cases, and the average age of all injuries was 36 years. Low-grade AAST Grade I?III injuries comprised of 76% (n = 62) of injuries, AAST Grade IV contributed to 20% (n = 16) and 4% (n = 3) of injuries were AAST Grade V. The most common mechanism of injury was road accidents accounting for 35% (n = 28) followed by fall-related injuries (26%, n = 21). Other mechanisms included sport-related (13.5%, n = 11), non-motorized bicycle injuries (8.5%, n = 7), alleged assault (8.5%, n = 7), pedestrian injuries (5%, n = 4) and horse-related injuries (2%, n = 2). Ninety-six percent (n = 78) of kidney injuries were managed conservatively. Of the patients requiring intervention, all were AAST Grade V kidney injuries. Conclusion Males accounted for the majority of renal trauma cases, similar to the 3:1 ratio of male-to-female injuries found in other studies. In line with other studies, renal trauma reviewed on the Gold Coast also revealed road trauma as the leading cause, closely followed by falls. The majority of high-grade renal trauma was managed conservatively.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the impact of an immediate ultrasound feedback intervention on trainee accuracy in vaginal examination-based assessment of fetal head position. Methods This was a prospective cohort study conducted at a single tertiary care center. Six third year and six fourth year residents were the study subjects. The third-year residents underwent a training intervention in which fetal head position was first assessed by resident transvaginal digital exam, then by ultrasound. All exams were performed on women with singleton gestations ≥ 35 weeks and cervical dilation ≥ 8 cm, following rupture of membranes. Comparison groups were third year residents before training, third year residents after training, and fourth year residents without training. The primary outcome was the difference in third year resident exam accuracy before and after ultrasound feedback training. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with digital exam accuracy. Results Three hundred and ninety exams were performed. The accuracy of third year resident exams was 55% before training, 65% during training, and 70% after training, while that of fourth-year residents who did not undergo training was 52% (P = 0.04). Multivariable analysis revealed a positive correlation between ultrasound feedback training and ability to accurately assess fetal head position. After adjusting for the variables included in the final model, third year pre-training exams and fourth year exams were less likely to be accurate than third year post-training exams (OR 0.50, CI 0.26-0.93 and OR 0.43, CI 0.22-0.81, respectively). The fourth year residents who did not undergo ultrasound training demonstrated similar baseline accuracy to the third year residents pre-training [52% (47/90) vs. 55% (53/96), P =0.68], but significantly lower accuracy than the third year residents post-training (P = 0.01). Conclusion Immediate ultrasound feedback training increased trainee accuracy in vaginal assessment of fetal head position in labor. Its integration into obstetric training programs should be considered. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Diagnosis and treatment of pathologies involving synovial structures in the shoulder region are technically difficult. Ultrasound-guided (UG) injection techniques have been shown to be highly accurate, safe and reliable for various structures in human and equine patients. Objectives: To develop easy-to-use and reliable UG injection techniques for the infraspinatus bursa (IB), bicipital bursa (BB) and scapulohumeral joint (SHJ) and to compare them with conventional ?blind? methods. Methods: Eight pairs of equine shoulders were positioned on a computed-tomography (CT) table with left and right shoulders randomly assigned to Operator A (UG) and Operator B (?blind?). Contrast medium mixed with methylene blue was injected into the target structures. Time and number of attempts for correct needle placement and ease of injection were recorded. A CT scan of each shoulder was performed after every injection to evaluate the location of contrast material. Once injections and CT scans were completed, anatomic dissections were conducted. Statistical analysis was used to compare UG and ?blind? techniques with significance set at P<0.05. Results: Intra-synovial injections using UG techniques were successful in all 24 synovial structures compared with 14/24 with conventional methods. The median number and range of needle repositioning to obtain accurate needle placement was 1 (1?2) for UG and 2 (1?4) for the ?blind? techniques. The median time and range required for accurate needle placement was 75.5?s (32?210?s) for UG and 43.5?s (11?140) for ?blind? technique. In 31% of all attempts, ease of injection was not indicative of successful intra-synovial administration. Conclusions: Ultrasound-guided injections of IB, BB and SHJ proved to be highly reliable and more accurate than conventional ?blind? techniques. Potential relevance: Ultrasound-guided injection techniques may be of great help for equine practitioners in the diagnosis and treatment of pathologies involving synovial structures in the shoulder region. Further work is needed to confirm these results in clinical cases.

AB  - Summary.? Background: Recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) risk factors include a first idiopathic DVT, strongly suggesting the existence of undiagnosed and/or unidentified prothrombotic abnormalities. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of locally increased red blood cell (RBC) aggregation on DVT pathogenesis in a rabbit model. Methods: DVT presence, flow and aggregation were measured in situ with ultrasound. Greatly enhanced aggregation was achieved by covalent linkage of Pluronic F98 to the RBC surface; coating with Pluronic F68, which very mildly enhances aggregation, was used as a coating control. On day 1, endothelial damage and a partial stenosis were surgically created on the left femoral vein whereas the right femoral vein was not manipulated. Results: A thrombus was formed within 30?min in six out of seven left femoral veins of animals receiving a 30% volume blood exchange with F98-coated RBC, whereas a thrombus occurred in only one out of seven veins in F68-transfused controls. In vivo imaging using quantitative ultrasound confirmed increased aggregation in the thrombosed veins of the F98 group compared with the F68 group and the contralateral vessel. For each group, five animals were followed for 2?weeks before being killed. In F98-transfused animals, lysis of clots occurred and the presence of chronic thrombi totally occluding the vein in three out of five animals was confirmed by histology. Conversely, in the F68 group, a single disorganized blood clot was observed in one out of five animals. Conclusions: A marked increase in RBC aggregation promotes thrombosis in rabbit femoral veins, confirming a pathophysiological role of locally altered hemorheology in the onset of DVT.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the peripheral vascular trauma. The presence of a vascular ?hard sign? is highly specific for major vascular injury and mandates operative exploration, however, absence of hard signs does not reliably exclude injury. In contrast, the ?soft signs? of vascular injury does not reliably predict major vascular trauma. It is generally accepted that in the absence of hard signs, patients with a normal peripheral vascular examination does not require further investigation regardless of the presence of soft signs. The arterial pressure index (API) has gained acceptance in some trauma centers as a useful tool in the evaluation of peripheral vascular trauma. While duplex ultrasonography is non-invasive, it is less sensitive in the diagnosis of peripheral vascular trauma than angiography and requires the presence of a trained ultrasonographer, who may not be available at all times.

AB  - Abstract Various ultrasound gray-scale patterns of 45 consecutive abscesses were studied in 43 surgical and medical patients. Eleven abscess formations were unsuspected clinically, 27 had developed as a postoperative complication; 25 collections (55.6%) presented with an anechoic appearance, and 15 (33.3%) showed a mainly fluid pattern but contained a few nonreverberatory echoes. Five abscesses (11.1%) appeared with a complex solid-like pattern with large amounts of internal echoes. A total of 28 ultrasound guided diagnostic fine-needle aspirations of abscesses were performed on 26 patients without serious complications. All the aspirated samples yielded material sufficient for cytological or bacteriological examinations. Percutaneous fine-needle aspiration guided by sonography is recommended as a safe and useful diagnostic measure to confirm the nature of an ultrasonically displayed abdominal lesion suspected to be an abscess. Results from both sonography and confirmatory aspiration provide detailed topographic and diagnostic information for the choice of surgical or nonoperative management of abdominal abscess.

AB  - ABSTRACT We examined how diverse and cumulated traumatic experiences predicted maternal prenatal mental health and infant stress regulation in war conditions and whether maternal mental health mediated the association between trauma and infant stress regulation. Participants were 511 Palestinian mothers from the Gaza Strip who reported exposure to current war trauma (WT), past childhood emotional (CEA) and physical abuse, socioeconomic status (SES), prenatal mental health problems (posttraumatic stress disorder and depression symptoms), and perceived stress during their secondtrimester of pregnancy as well as infant stress regulation at 4 months. While all trauma types were associated with high levels of prenatal symptoms, CEA had the most wide-ranging effects and was uniquely associated with depression symptoms. Concerning infant stress regulation, mothers? CEA predicted negative affectivity, but only among mothers with low WT. Against hypothesis, the effects of maternal trauma on infant stress regulation were not mediated by mental health symptoms. Mothers? higher SES was associated with better infant stress regulation whereas infant prematurity and male sex predisposed for difficulties. Our findings suggest that maternal childhood abuse, especially CEA, should be a central treatment target among war-exposed families. Cumulated psychosocial stressors might increase the risk for transgenerational problems.

AB  - Summary In Thoroughbred racehorses, the dorsal cortex (DC) of the third metacarpal bone (MC3) enlarges when horses are first exposed to fast exercise speeds. It is now possible to measure ultrasound speed through 3 to 5 mm depths of bone around the bone shaft using Sunlight Medical's ?Omnisense? machine. The aim of this experiment was to determine whether the ultrasound speed measured in the surface 3?5 mm of the midshaft dorsal cortex of MC3 could be related directly to the midshaft shape and size of the MC3s of young Thoroughbred racehorses at the same stage of training. Sixteen 2-year-old and sixteen 3 to 6-year-old racehorses, exercising at racing speed at the same training stable, had their ultrasound speed measured and were radiographed to measure their MC3 midshaft size (width of DC) and shape ([DC/palmar cortex] x [{DC+palmar cortex}/medulla widths]). There were significant linear relationships between ultrasound speed and radiographic bone size and shape measurements. The faster ultrasound speeds were associated with bones that were both absolutely and proportionately thinner in the dorsal cortex in both groups of racehorses. The measurement of ultrasound speed with the Sunlight Omnisense machine should allow more detailed and accurate predictions to be made for responses of the bone to exercise in the midshaft of MC3 than is possible using radiographic size and shape measurements alone. This should make it possible to predict, for example, how soon after a change in bone shape a specific horse can race with minimal risk of damage to the newly-forming bone surface.

AB  - Summary We aimed to compare the reliability of aspiration via a nasogastric tube with ultrasound for assessment of residual gastric volume. Sixty-one adult patients who were mechanically ventilated and received continuous enteral feeding through a nasogastric tube for > 48 h were included. A first qualitative and quantitative ultrasound examination of the gastric antrum was followed by gastric suctioning, performed by an operator blinded to the result of the ultrasound examination. A second ultrasound examination was performed thereafter, followed by re-injection of the aspirated gastric contents (≤ 250 ml) into the stomach. A third ultrasound assessment was then immediately performed. If the suctioned volume was ≥ 250 ml, 250 mg erythromycin was infused over 30 min. A fourth ultrasound was performed 90 min after the third. Sixty (98%) patients had a qualitatively assessed full stomach at first ultrasound examination vs. 52 (85%) after gastric suctioning (p = 0.016). The calculated gastric volume significantly decreased after gastric suctioning, without a significant decrease in the number of patients with volume ≥ 250 ml. Four of the nine patients with calculated gastric volume ≥ 250 ml had vomiting within the last 24 h (p = 0.013). The antral cross-sectional area significantly decreased between the third and the fourth ultrasound examination (p = 0.015). Erythromycin infusion did not make a significant difference to gastric volume (n = 10). Our results demonstrate that gastric suctioning is not a reliable tool for monitoring residual gastric volume. Gastric ultrasound is a feasible and promising tool for gastric volume monitoring in clinical practice.

AB  - Summary Brachial plexus blockade in children can be used for a broad spectrum of clinical indications. Nevertheless, these regional anesthetic techniques are still underused in pediatric anesthesia that is mainly because of insufficient descriptions of the particular techniques. Ultrasound guidance enables direct visualization of neuronal and adjacent anatomical structures, the cannula, and the spread of local anesthetic. The most important issue in this context is theoretical background knowledge and intensive training of hand skills. The following review article discusses all relevant aspects of ultrasound-guided brachial plexus blockade.

AB  - Objective To review the literature and make practical recommendations regarding the conservative management of renal trauma. Patients and Methods Relevant articles and guidelines published between 1980 and 2014 were reviewed. Graded recommendations were constructed by a multi-disciplinary panel consisting of urologists, radiologists, and infectious disease physicians. These recommendations underwent formal review and debate at the Western Australian USANZ 2013 state conference, and were presented at the USANZ 2014 annual scientific meeting. Results The literature on the conservative management of renal trauma is reviewed within the framework of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) kidney injury severity scale. Graded recommendations are made regarding several key topics including: imaging, inpatient management, antibiotics, return to activity, and follow-up. Grade IV injuries and intraoperative consults are examined separately in view of the difficulties these groups cause in making appropriate treatment decisions. Conclusion A practical clinical guideline is provided regarding the conservative management of renal trauma.

AB  - Summary Ultrasound examination of the gastric antrum is a non-invasive tool that allows reliable estimation of gastric contents. We performed this prospective cohort study in non-elective paediatric surgery to assess whether gastric ultrasound may help to determine the best anaesthetic induction technique, whether rapid sequence or routine. The primary outcome was the reduction of inappropriate induction technique. A pre-operative clinical assessment was performed by the attending anaesthetist who made a provisional plan for induction. Gastric ultrasound was performed in the semirecumbent and right lateral decubitus positions for a qualitative assessment of gastric contents, using a 0?2 grading scale. A final induction plan was made based on this assessment. Immediately after tracheal intubation, gastric contents were suctioned through a multi-orifice nasogastric tube; these were defined as above risk threshold for regurgitation and aspiration if there was clear fluid > 0.8 ml.kg?1, and/or the presence of thick fluid and/or solid particles. Gastric ultrasound was feasible in 130 out of 143 (90%) of children, and led to a change in the planned induction technique in 67 patients: 30 from routine to rapid sequence, and 37 from rapid sequence to routine. An appropriate induction technique was therefore performed in 85% of children, vs. 49% planned after pre-operative clinical assessment alone (p < 0.00001). Our results suggest that gastric ultrasound is a useful guide to the general anaesthetic induction technique with respect to the risk of pulmonary aspiration, in comparison with pre-operative clinical assessment alone.

AB  - Abstract? Pelvic abscesses present a serious and challenging management problem. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided drainage provides a safe and effective minimally invasive treatment option. The likelihood of a successful outcome is dependent on appropriate patient selection, drainage technique and postoperative management. This review outlines the evidence behind and procedural steps required for EUS-guided pelvic abscess drainage.
