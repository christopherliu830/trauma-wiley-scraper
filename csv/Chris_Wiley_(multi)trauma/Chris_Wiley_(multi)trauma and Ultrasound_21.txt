AB  - Summary This book is focused on the assessment of a stroke patient linking the neurological findings with the evaluation of vessels, and on integration of these findings with parenchymal and perfusion imaging. The neurological symptom onset was long equated with the timing of a thromboembolic occlusion. In reality, it is not. Symptom onset is the time of the collateral or residual flow depletion to a level causing the neuronal dysfunction. Structured case-based problem solving is provided to illustrate how to approach typical patient problems, what key questions we ask to begin patient management, and the complimentary use of diverse ultrasound tests to the neurological examination and the standard or care CT or MRI scanning across different pathogenic mechanisms. Early determination of the stroke mechanism is the key to treatment selection.

AB  - Summary Varicose veins are common and aside from causing complications of aching heaviness, thrombophlebitis, bleeding and ulceration are generally regarded as being unsightly. Non-invasive duplex ultrasound can accurately diagnose sites of venous valve incompetence allowing targeted intervention. Aside from traditional surgery, innovative venous ablative therapies such as radiofrequency and endovenous laser ablation have been developed. With any venous intervention the risk of recurrence over time represents the major challenge. Lymphoedema of the lower limbs is a common cause of lower limb oedema. It is important to determine whether it is primary or secondary lymphoedema but the mainstay of therapy is conservative with elevation, remedial massage and compression garments.

Abstract The use of appropriate resuscitation targets or end-points may facilitate early detection and appropriate management of shock. There is a fine balance between oxygen delivery and consumption, and when this is perturbed, an oxygen debt is generated. In this narrative review, we explore the value of global haemodynamic resuscitation end-points, including pulse rate, blood pressure, central venous pressure and mixed/central venous oxygen saturations. The evidence supporting the reliability of these parameters as end-points for guiding resuscitation and their potential limitations are evaluated.

AB  - Abstract Objectives This study was an ex vivo evaluation of the marginal adaptation of mineral trioxide aggregate as an apical barrier using teeth with an open apex and scanning electron microscopy. Materials and methods Eighteen single-rooted human teeth were used. An artificial open apex was created using Gates Glidden drills #6?1 in a crown-down manner until the #1 bur passed through the foramen. A 1.36-mm divergent open apex was created at the foramen by retrograde apical transportation using a #40 Profile 0.6 taper instrument inserted to the length of the cutting blade. The teeth were divided into four groups (n = 4), and two teeth served as controls. The GI = mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) was placed as a 5-mm-thick apical barrier without removal of the smear layer; GII = MTA was placed with indirect ultrasonic activation; GIII = apical plug was placed after removal of the smear layer without indirect ultrasonic activation; and GIV = MTA was placed with indirect ultrasonic activation, but the smear layer had been previously removed. The root apices were visualized with SEM (1000?), and 12 predetermined material/dentine interface points were measured (gaps). One-way anova and Bonferroni's post hoc tests were used to compare the linear measurements of the gaps between the groups. Results GIV had the lowest gap when compared with other groups, and no statistical differences were found among GI, GII, and GIII. Conclusions The technique of MTA placement using passive ultrasonic vibration in association with smear layer removal improved the marginal adaptation of the material.

AB  - ABSTRACT The past decade has seen a dramatic rise in clinical and research interests in pleural disease in parallel with rising incidences of pleural cancers and infection worldwide. Development of specialist pleural services can streamline patient diagnosis and therapy, reduce health-care resource consumption, improve procedural training and safety and facilitate clinical research. Pleural ultrasound, pleuroscopy, indwelling pleural catheter services and pleural procedural education programmes for junior staff are important elements of most specialist pleural units. An integrated service including radiology, pathology, oncology and thoracic surgery input is pivotal to success. Establishing funding support and referral sources are the common initial hurdles. This article provides an overview of the need for specialist pleural disease units, the essential elements required and the likely challenges encountered in setting a service up.

AB  - ABSTRACT This study was carried out to determine the time and concentration profile required to achieve vancomycin-mediated eradication of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm. This information is critical for the identification of performance targets for local antibiotic delivery vehicles that target biofilm infections. S. aureus UAMS-1 biofilms were grown for 7 days on titanium?aluminium?niobium discs in Mueller Hinton broth. After 7 days, the discs were then incubated in Mueller Hinton broth containing vancomycin at concentrations of 100, 200, 500, 1,000, and 2,000?mg/L. Biofilm eradication was assessed under both static and shaking conditions. Samples were retrieved at regular intervals for up to 28 days for quantification of residual biofilm. One additional disc was processed per time point for scanning electron microscopy. Progressive and significant reduction of viable bacteria was observed over time at all concentrations compared to unexposed controls. After 28 days under static conditions, the S. aureus biofilm was completely eradicated at 200?mg/L vancomycin and higher concentrations, but not at 100?mg/L. In contrast, bacterial biofilm could not be eradicated under shaking conditions at any concentration. Clinical significance: The present study shows that it is possible to eradicate mature S. aureus biofilm from metal implants by vancomycin alone although the time concentration profile required cannot be achieved by systemic administration or any of the local delivery vehicles currently available. Identifying targets for antibiotic delivery is the first step in developing fit for purpose local antibiotic delivery vehicles that will successfully and predictably treat established biofilm infection. ? 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Background. Surgical resection is the most effective therapy for liver cancer. Intraoperative blood loss during liver resection remains a major concern due to association with higher postoperative complications. The InLine radiofrequency ablation device (ILRFA) has achieved promising results in liver surgery with minimal blood loss and no increase of postoperative complications. In this multicentre controlled study, 108 patients undergoing liver resection were investigated. Patients and methods. A total of 108 patients underwent liver resections in 4 medical centres; the prospective sequential cohort study consisted of 54 ILRFA and 54 ultrasonic surgical aspirator transections as the control group. Results. The type of liver resection performed was very similar in both groups. The median number of RFA deployments was 3 (range 1?12) with a median coagulation time of 9 (range 3?36) min. Median blood loss was 165±20 ml (range 5?675) in the ILRFA and 654±83 ml (range 80?3600) in the control group (p<0.001). The median transection time was 27 (2?219) min in the ILRFA group and 35 (5?62) min in controls. Conclusions. Our study indicates that ILRFA device for liver transection is effective in reducing blood loss and is safe. Precoagulation before parenchymal transection appears to be a valid concept in liver surgery. The avoidance of vascular inflow occlusion during parenchymal transection could also be of value.

AB  - Reasons for performing study In man, pulmonary veins (PV) are of major importance in atrial fibrillation pathophysiology as ectopy often originates in atrial myocardial sleeves extending in the PV wall. In addition, PV size on ultrasound is used to assess left atrial volume overload. In horses, PV anatomy and ultrasound have hardly been studied. Objectives To study PV anatomy and establish a standard approach for echocardiographic identification of the PV from a right and left parasternal view. Study design Anatomical and echocardiographic description. Methods Firstly, post mortem left atrial and PV silicone corrosion casts were made in 10 horses to investigate normal PV anatomy. Secondly, left and right parasternal ultrasound images and silicone casts were made in 3 horses, to compare images and casts. Results Four major PV ostia were identified on the casts, draining specific lung areas. From a right parasternal longitudinal view, ostium III was identified between the right atrial wall and right pulmonary artery, and ostium II left-dorsal to it. From a left parasternal oblique short-axis view, ostium III, its antrum and side-branches were used as anatomical landmarks (adjacent to the right atrial wall). Slightly more caudal, ostium II was visualised with, in one horse, its antrum and 2 branches. Ostium I was only seen in one horse, slightly ventral to ostium II. Ostium IV was always identified in cross-section on a left short-axis view, left to the pulmonary artery bifurcation. Conclusions A standard echocardiographic approach allows identification of pulmonary veins in adult horses. Left oblique and short axis views were superior although right long-axis views also showed ostiums II and III. These data allow reference values to be established for pulmonary venous size and flow, and to investigate new treatment strategies for atrial fibrillation.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction: Contemporaneous measures of muscle architecture and force have not previously been conducted during critical illness to examine their relationship with intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired weakness. Methods: Ankle dorsiflexor muscle force (ADMF) with high-frequency electrical peroneal nerve stimulation and skeletal muscle architecture via ultrasound were measured in 21 adult, critically ill patients, 16 at ICU admission. Results: Thirteen patients were measured on 2 occasions. Among these, 10 who were measured at ICU admission demonstrated muscle weakness. Despite significant reductions in tibialis anterior (? = ?88.5 ± 78.8 mm2, P = 0.002) and rectus femoris (? = ?126.1 ± 129.1 mm2, P = 0.006) cross-sectional areas between occasions, ADMF did not change (100-HZ ankle dorsiflexor force 9.8 [IQR, 8.0?14.4] kg vs. 8.6 (IQR, 6.7?19.2) kg, P = 0.9). Discussion: Muscle weakness was evident at ICU admission. No additional decrements were observed 7 days later despite significant reductions in muscle size. These data suggest that not all ICU weakness is truly ?acquired? and questions our understanding of muscle function during critical illness. Muscle Nerve 57: 964?972, 2018

Sample Population Cadaveric canine cervical spinal specimens (n?=?3; C1?7; C1?T1; C2?T1). Methods The spinal cord of each explanted spinal unit was replaced with a saline-filled latex condom. In 8 disc spaces, ventral slot surgery was performed using a previously reported technique. Bone removal was achieved using a motorized burr (MB). In 8 disc spaces, bone was removed via en bloc ostectomy with a PI that selectively cuts mineralized tissue. Surgical duration and operating field visibility were recorded. Rupture of the fluid filled condom was used as a measure of iatrogenic collateral trauma. Computed tomography was used to measure ventral slot morphometry. Results Mean surgical duration for PI (23.4?minutes) was significantly shorter than for MB (34.1?minutes; P?=?.049). Using a 4 point Likert scale (4?=?excellent, 3?=?good, 2?=?fair, 1?=?poor), median visibility score was significantly higher for PI (2) than for MB (1; P?=?.03). The condom burst twice (1MB, 1PI) during elevation of the dorsal longitudinal ligament; there was no significant difference between techniques for incidence of collateral trauma (P?=?.99). Regardless of surgical technique, there was a bias in slot deviation towards the right (i.e., the surgeon's left; P?=?.021). Conclusions The PI allowed completion of ventral slots in a significantly shorter time, without an increased incidence of iatrogenic trauma. The right-handed surgeon showed a left-sided aiming bias, regardless of surgical technique.

AB  - A 16-year-old male was transported to our emergency department after he was kicked in the abdomen by a horse. He was diagnosed with injury of the liver and abdominal rectus muscle, and was cured by observational treatment. An Ichushi search was undertaken to identify articles published from 1983 to 2013 using the key words ?horse? and ?trauma?. We found 13 cases that described horse-related injuries and summarized these cases, including our case. There were 10 males, three females and one patient of an undescribed sex. The patients ranged in age from 16 to 58 years old, with an average age of 33 years. The injured sites were predominantly the face (mandible) and upper abdomen, indicating that a projecting part of the body may be more likely to be injured. Cardiac rupture, aortic head injury, or lethality induced by a horse kick have not been reported in Japan, but such injuries have been reported in other countries. Ten of 15 cases (67%) required surgical treatment for severe injuries. Horse kick injuries tend to be severe, because the transfer of energy from the end of the hoof, with a small cross-sectional area, to a small field, leads to internal organic injuries that are more severe than predicted, similar to a handlebar injury. Accordingly, we advocate the close observation of patients with horse kick injuries, which may be regarded as being similar to blunt stab wounds or hidden speared injuries.

Methods. Data from 30 asymptomatic subjects between the ages of 22 and 35 were collected. CSA and circumference of the GON and CSA of OCI were measured using sonography. Interexaminer reliability analysis was performed using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Results. The CSA of the GON and OCI were 2 mm2 ± 1 mm2 and 1.86 cm2 ± 0.51 cm2, respectively. The average circumference of the GON was 4.8 mm ± 1.3 mm. The interexaminer reliability of the measurements was excellent with intraclass correlation coefficient coefficients of 0.91, 0.84, and 0.73 for the GON CSA, GON circumference, and OCI CSA, respectively. Conclusion. We report the normal values of the CSA of the GON and OCI. Knowledge of these normal values may facilitate the diagnosis of GON entrapment and provide outcome measures in therapeutic interventions. ? 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Clin Ultrasound, 2010

AB  - Abstract Open fetal surgery through a wide hysterotomy is no longer a real option for prenatal intervention, but a minimally invasive approach has emerged as treatment for a small number of indications. Endoscopic ablation of placental vessels is the preferred treatment for severe twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome and it may be the only chance to salvage the most severe forms of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Several other indications are currently under review and may become justified in the future, provided that diagnostic accuracy and patient selection become more accurate. Before invasive fetal intervention becomes widely accepted, however, we need to better define outcome. It is no longer acceptable to express results in terms of survival at birth. Survival at discharge and long-term morbidity must be considered as well. Copyright ? 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Facial defects that extended into the sinuses of two horses were repaired by using adjacent periosteum to cover the defects, using either a single flap or double flap technique. Acceptable cosmetic appearance was restored in both horses. Resistance to penetration of a needle and ultrasonic scanning demonstrated bony bridging in one horse.

AB  - Objectives The objective of this study was to compare hospitalisation duration, survival times, adverse events and cost of therapy in dogs with presumptive primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia undergoing therapy with mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids versus cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Methods A retrospective study of medical case records of dogs with presumed primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia was conducted. Data collected included signalment, presenting complaints, haematologic and biochemical profiles, vector-borne disease testing, thoracic and abdominal radiographs, abdominal ultrasound, medications administered, duration of hospitalisation, 30- and 60-day survival, adverse events and cost of therapy. Variables were compared between dogs treated solely with mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids or cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Results A total of 55 dogs with primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia were identified. Eighteen were excluded because multiple immunosuppressive medications were used during treatment. Hospitalisation times, 30-day survival and 60-day survival times were similar between both groups. Dogs in the mycophenolate mofetil/corticosteroid group experienced fewer adverse events than the cyclosporine/corticosteroid group. Therapy with mycophenolate mofetil was less expensive than that with cyclosporine. Clinical Significance These results suggest that using the combination of mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids appears to be as effective as cyclosporine and corticosteroids in the treatment of presumed primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia in dogs. Adverse events were less common and cost of therapy was lower in the mycophenolate mofetil group. Additional larger prospective, controlled, double-masked, outcome-based, multi-institutional studies are required to substantiate these preliminary findings.

AB  - Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a method that uses the intrinsic nature of local magnetic fields to enhance image contrast in order to improve the visibility of various susceptibility sources and to facilitate diagnostic interpretation. It is also the precursor to the concept of the use of phase for quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Nowadays, SWI has become a widely used clinical tool to image deoxyhemoglobin in veins, iron deposition in the brain, hemorrhages, microbleeds and calcification. In this article, we review the basics of SWI, including data acquisition, data reconstruction and post-processing. In particular, the source of cusp artifacts in phase images is investigated in detail and an improved multi-channel phase data combination algorithm is provided. In addition, we show a few clinical applications of SWI for the imaging of stroke, traumatic brain injury, carotid vessel wall, siderotic nodules in cirrhotic liver, prostate cancer, prostatic calcification, spinal cord injury and intervertebral disc degeneration. As the clinical applications of SWI continue to expand both in and outside the brain, the improvement of SWI in conjunction with QSM is an important future direction of this technology.
