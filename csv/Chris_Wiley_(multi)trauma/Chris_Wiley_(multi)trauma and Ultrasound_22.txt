AB  - Background To decrease perinatal mortality and morbidity rate in case of multifetal pregnancy fetal reduction (MFPR) in the first trimester was introduced. Methods Combine ultrasound and Doppler evaluation of fetal chromosomal abnormality markers, fetal structure and biometry, chorionicity and amnionicity, arterial and venous circulation in fetal-placental-maternal functional system were introduced as an algorithm before MFPR. Results 355 fetuses in 112 women were examined before 141 MFPR. NT thickness was above 2.5?mm in 1,7% of fetuses and one fetus had reverse DV flow. But no fetal chromosomal defects were detected after CVS. No specific severe complications for multifetal pregnancy were registered in completed pregnancies. Average gestational age at birth was 35,5 w that was less then in essential twins but perinatal mortality rate was 5.8? and 12.8? correspondingly. Conclusion MFPR with combine fetal examination seems to be the way to improve multifetal pregnancy outcome.

AB  - Tendinopathy is a common condition, which has been linked to surrogate measures of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity and insulin resistance. This study aimed to compare in vivo measures of the SNS and insulin resistance between individuals with and without Achilles tendinopathy. This case?control study compared Achilles tendinopathy sufferers to healthy controls. SNS activity was quantified using muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), while metabolic status was assessed via a modified glucose tolerance test and fasting lipid panel. Ultrasound tissue characterization assessed tendon structure. Resting MSNA did not differ between the 15 cases and 20 controls. Tendon pain duration in tendinopathy patients was correlated with burst frequency (R2=.32, P=.02) and burst incidence (R2=.41, P=.01) of MSNA. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, there was a trend suggesting fasting glucose was greater in cases (median 4.80, IQR .70 in cases vs 4.51, .38 in controls) and correlated with pain severity (R2=.14, P=.03), but no other metabolic measures were associated with tendon pain/structure. This study indicates that SNS activity is associated with tendon pain duration, building on previous data indicating the SNS is involved in recalcitrant tendinopathy. Metabolic parameters had little relationship with Achilles tendinopathy in this metabolically homogenous sample. Prospective studies are required to uncover the precise relationship between SNS activity, insulin resistance, and tendinopathy.

AB  - Objectives Our purpose was to evaluate the risks of malignancy in surgically removed ovarian cysts that preoperatively were characterized as unilocular by transvaginal sonography. Study design This prospective analysis included 1307 women operated at two European university Hospitals between January 1992 and December 1997. Based on ultrasonographic findings the cysts were characterized either as echo-free, without solid parts or papillary formations (group I) or cysts with solid parts/papillary formations or echogenic cyst content (group II). Ultrasonographic and macroscopic appearance of the cysts were compared with histopathological diagnosis. Results In group I seven of 670 (1.1%) proved to be borderline or malignant, and all measured â‰¥?75?mm in diameter. The corresponding figures for cysts in group II were 24 of 634 (3.8%). The frequency of borderline/malignant cysts increased significantly with the size of the cysts. Conclusion Unilocular, echo-free cysts (group I) with a mean diameter above 50?mm and all unilocular cysts with solid parts/papillary formations should be removed surgically. Serial ultrasound follow-up should be the standard procedure of unilocular, echo-free cysts less than 50?mm.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the accuracy of ultrasound in identifying fetal brain space occupying lesions. Study design A retrospective evaluation of 14 cases of fetal brain space occupying lesions has been performed. All prenatal ultrasonographic diagnoses (5 teratomas, 1 choroid plexus papilloma and 8 arachnoid cysts) were compared with the postnatal findings on the aborted fetuses or on the newborns. Results In 11 out of 14 cases the antenatal ultrasonographic diagnosis was confirmed postnatally; 1 case of supratentorial arachnoid cyst was mistaken for a teratoma and 2 cases of porencephalic cysts were wrongly diagnosed as arachnoid cysts (specificity = 78.5%). The specificity was better in the subgroup of solid or complex masses (5 out of 6?=?83.3%) than in the subgroup of cystic lesions (6 out of 8?=?75%). Conclusions Prenatal ultrasonography is a useful tool to identify any intracranial space-occupying lesion. In the present study it has shown a 78.5% specificity in the diagnosis of brain masses, with better results in the solid than in the cystic lesions. The distinction between the different causes of fetal brain space occupying lesions is clinically relevant, as each one carries different prognostic implications.

AB  - Summary Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) often occurs in patients with associated autoimmune diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus, but it can also occur in patients without other associated autoimmune disease. Studies of women with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL)-related complications show that women with thrombotic complications of APS have higher rates of pre-term delivery. Women with APS need close monitoring throughout pregnancy. Uterine artery Doppler scanning is recommended at 20-24 weeks, to check for evidence of bilateral uterine arterial notching, which has been shown to be predictive of placental dysfunction in women with APS. If bilateral notching is detected, serial growth scans are performed to monitor for intrauterine growth restriction. Patients present with multi-organ failure due to widespread thrombosis, and there is an associated high mortality rate. They require aggressive management, usually in an intensive care setting, with a combination of steroids, anticoagulation and/or plasma exchange.

AB  - Summary Jaw fractures occur commonly in cats and dogs as a result of vehicular trauma, falls from heights, or by, objects, dog fights, and/or an altercation with another animal. With jaw fracture repair it is essential to maintain normal occlusion. The goal of the jaw fracture repair is to return the patient's mouth to normal function as soon as possible. Multi-modal analgesia must be applied to prevent pain in the patient. The use of tape muzzles or commercial nylon muzzles is suitable and sufficient for certain jaw fractures in some patients. Nylon or tape muzzles are also a nice additional support for other types of jaw fracture repair. Interdental bonding, interdental wiring, and acrylic reinforcement are other options for jaw fracture repair that are relatively inexpensive and not as technically challenging as some of the more invasive methods of jaw fracture repair, and are considered adequate in many jaw fracture cases.

Methods: Medical records for 23 cats diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and with serum feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity concentrations available were reviewed. Three groups were compared; cats with serum feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity concentrations 2Â·0 to 6Â·8 Âµg/l (group A), 6Â·9 to 11Â·9 Âµg/l (group B) and â‰¥12Â·0 Âµg/l (group C). Results: Sixteen of the 23 cats had increased serum feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity concentrations; 9 cats in group B and 7 cats in group C. The remaining seven cats were in group A. Cats with serum feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity concentrations â‰¥12Â·0 Âµg/l had significantly lower median serum albumin and cobalamin concentrations. No significant differences were identified between the three groups for age, serum alanine amino transferase and alkaline phosphatase activities, feline inflammatory bowel disease clinical disease activity index, pancreatic ultrasound findings, intestinal histopathology scores, clinical outcome, treatment or clinical response. Clinical Significance: Hypoalbuminaemia and hypocobalaminaemia were more frequently observed in cats with serum feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity concentrations â‰¥12Â·0 Âµg/l.

AB  - Abstract A correct diagnosis and an understanding of the aetiology and dynamics of the processes involved in tooth resorption is critical to effective management. Tooth resorptions can be classified as: (1) trauma induced; (2) infection induced; or (3) hyperplastic invasive. Some transient trauma induced resorptions require no treatment but must be carefully monitored to check that there are no complicating issues such as infection. In cases of trauma induced replacement resorption, a multidisciplinary approach is usually necessary to ensure an optimal long-term solution. Infection induced tooth resorptions require the removal of the invading micro-organisms by endodontic therapy including intra-canal medication which can also facilitate repair of the resorbed tooth structure. The hyperplastic invasive tooth resorptions pose considerable challenges in management due to the complexity and aggressive nature of the resorptive process. With careful case selection and complete inactivation of resorptive tissue successful management can be achieved.

AB  - ABSTRACT Since venous collaterals were described in 1981 as causing linear densities in the perirenal fat, the list of causes of perirenal cobwebs has continued to grow. Inflammatory and neoplastic processes, particularly those originating in the kidney, may produce similar appearances. If no cause for the cobwebs is found in the kidney, extrarenal pathology should be considered, in particular acute pancreatitis and aortic aneurysm rupture. Four patients are described who all demonstrated unilateral perirenal cobwebs in association with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. It is postulated that blood enters the perinephric fat through weak points in the renal fascia caused by the entrance of vessels.

AB  - Objective Neonatal outcome was studied in 169 infants from diamniotic monochorionic (DAMC) and diamniotic dichorionic (DADC) twin pregnancies in relation to a measure of blood flow redistribution, the cerebroplacental ratio (CPR). Study design Two groups were assessed, 50 infants from DAMC, and 119 infants from DADC twin pregnancies. Targeted ultrasound and Doppler recordings of umbilical artery (UA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) were obtained. The resistance index (RI) and CPR were calculated for each fetus. Results DAMC twins had lower birth weight (1979 vs. 2223?g for DADC, pâ‰¤.01) and prolonged lengths of nicu stay (8.5?days vs. 3.5?days for DADC, pâ‰¤.05). For total group, DAMC compared with DADC twins spent greater numbers of days on a ventilator. SGA infants were significantly more frequent in DAMC twins compared to DADC twins. Among antenatal Doppler variables only the CPR demonstrated a significant difference between twin types. For DAMC twins CPR was 1.15 vs. 1.21 for DADC twins, pâ‰¤.05. Conclusions Monochorionic twins from the lower birth weight groups demonstrate a greater number of growth restricted infants and prolonged hospitalizations compared to DADC twins. Among Doppler measures, the CPR is superior to UA-RI, and/or MCA-RI for the prediction of adverse events.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study is to investigate processes of placentation by the use of three-dimensional sonography. Methods A group of 25 pregnant women in gestational age ranging six to 10 weeks underwent a detailed assessment. The ultrasound device was Voluson 530D MT, by Kretztechnik, Zipf, Austria. Measurements in three-dimensional B-mode were gestational sac volume, chorion volume, and embryonic volume. Volumes were measured by the use of an integrated software. Structures were outlined manually in multiple parallel sections. The machine integrated and calculated the volume. The hemodynamical changes correlated to the process of placentation were assessed by the use of three-dimensional power Doppler (angio mode). Three-dimensional imaging of vascular changes was expressed and quantified by the use of volume flow index (VFI). The analysis of the results included correlation of morphological and hemodynamical parameters obtained by measurements. Results The volume of gestational sac, chorion and embryo increases during the weeks of gestation under investigation. The amount of vascular spaces in the chorion and surrounding myometrium increase with gestational age and correlates with the gestational sac and chorion volume. Conclusion 3D power Doppler sonography is a valuable tool for assessment and quantification of hemodynamic changes involved in placentation.

AB  - The breast cancer metastases can be analyzed by ultrasound in ganglial and visceral organs. The detection of metastatic lymphonod in the axillar, cervical or supraclavicular regions and intrammamarian changes both the cancer staging and therapeutic planning. Benign lymphonode usually have an oval shape, hilum hyperechogenicity, narrow cortex and show hilar vascularization or radical central symmetric vascularization and absence of peripheral flow at Color Doppler. Malignant lymphonode are usually rounded hyporechoic, without hilar hyperechogenicity, and, in color Doppler, present multifocal aberrant vascularization, tortuous vessels or flow in the periphery. The most frequent visceral metastases of breast cancer are hepatic, the suprarenal glands and ovaries. About 86% of breast cancer hepatic metastases are hypoechoic. Ovarian cancer metastases can be detected mainly in pelvic tumors, peritonium tumors, glanglial, abdominal wall, hepatic and splenic metastases and ascites. Our study of 10 cases of splenic metastases of ovarian cancer has demonstrated six hyperechoic tumors, two hypoechoic and two tumors with necrosis. The use of color Doppler and Powerangio has demonstrated weak or moderate vascularization in glanglial and visceral metastases of gynecological tumors. The use of contrast (Levovist) has shown a more detailed vascular analysis by detecting vessels that were not identified in color Doppler and Powerangio without contrast.

AB  - At present there are four concepts guiding the sonographic examination of the fetal heart: (1) the fetal echocardiogram (FEC) is difficult to perform and time-consuming, (2) FEC should be performed only in high risk pregnancies, (3) the optimal time to perform FEC is 18?22?weeks gestation, (4) FEC relies on several sonographic still views. In our lecture, we will present a new systemic ?video? approach to the great vessels and the four chambers in early pregnancy using transvaginal sonography. Transvaginal ultrasound examination of the cardiovascular system was performed in 36?323 consecutive fetuses using a dynamic ?video? multidirectional approach. Cardiovascular anomalies were detected in 173 fetuses giving an overall incidence of 1 in 210 pregnancies and 1 in 238 low-risk pregnancies. Fifty-six percent of the fetuses had associated anomalies. The prenatal diagnosis was confirmed in 90 cases. In 10 fetuses a different cardiac anomaly was observed. In four fetuses the cardiovascular anomaly was not detected in early pregnancy. In the remaining cases, postmortem examination was not performed. Early fetal heart examination is suggested in all pregnancies. Conclusions Fetal ECC should be performed: (a) transvaginally, (b) in early pregnancy (14?16?weeks), (c) in every pregnancy , (d) using the video multidirectional approach.
