AB  - The intrauterine development of the central nervous system (CNS) is one of the most interesting fields in perinatology. The brain has three-dimensional structure and rapidly changes its appearance during pregnancy. Therefore, the fetal brain should be evaluated three-dimensionally with consideration of gestational age. Sonoembryology has been established by high-frequency transvaginal sonography. Premature brain structure and ventricular system of early fetuses can be clearly demonstrated and prenatal diagnosis of congenital anomalies has been done earlier and earlier. Application of transvaginal approach to the fetal brain in the second and third trimesters has enabled brain imaging from fetal parietal direction through fontanelles and cranial sutures, and ?neurosonography? has been established. Recent introduction of 3D ultrasound in neurosonography produced skull imaging, serial parallel images of the brain structure, volume extraction of target organ and brain circulatory images. Furthermore, advanced technology of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can demonstrate CNS morphology including the brain stem, which is not clearly depicted by sonography. By using all those technologies, prenatal diagnosis of CNS abnormalities has been more objective and accurate. Intracranial changes in cases with CNS anomalies have been objectively demonstrated in vivo. Furthermore, intrauterine acquired brain damage such as periventricular leukomalacia, which is one of the controversial issues in perinatology, has been proven by sonography in a few cases. Further case studies will be required for investigation of CNS pathology in utero.

AB  - Abstract. Objectives. Tendon xanthomas cause thickening of the tendon and are an important sign in monogenic familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). The aim of our study was to investigate the usefulness of achilles tendon sonography in detecting FH patients. Special attention was paid to structural abnormalities of the achilles tendon. Design. A clinical study with methodological testing. Setting. Patients suspected of having FH were sent to the out-patient Department of Medicine from other departments of Turku University Central Hospital and from primary care units. The patients were studied by high-frequency ultrasound before more exact typing of the lipid disorder. An additional study of normolipidaemic volunteers and a phantom study were also carried out. Subjects. Forty FH patients, 51 non-FH hypercholesterolaemia patients and 41 normolipidaemic volunteers were included in the study. Main outcome of measures. The thickness of the tendon was measured and the tendon structure and its echogenicity were recorded. Results. Twenty-five out of 40 (63%) FH patients had distinctly thickened tendons (men more than 10 mm, women more than 9 mm). Thirty-six (90%) had a typical structural alteration of low or mixed echogenicity of the tendon. Three non-FH patients were found to have xanthomas on sonography. Conclusions. We conclude that ultrasonography is a sensitive method of detecting xanothomas that reveals the altered tendon structure even in xanthomatous tendons of normal thickness.

AB  - Summary Veterinary technicians play an important role in preoperative planning by performing tests and providing the veterinary surgeon and anesthesia staff with the results. They also follow the veterinarian's orders by calculating medication dosage, filling prescriptions, and administering medications. Preoperative tests include complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry panel, and urinalysis. A database of a packed cell volume (PCV), total protein and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and blood glucose via a glucometer provides the minimal information required prior to surgery. In addition to the common blood and urine tests, a variety of conditions benefit from preoperative sampling. These include fine needle aspirates (FNA) of joints, abdomen, pulmonary spaces, masses, cysts, and abscesses for cytologic exam. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative imaging - radiographs, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast studies, and ultrasound - aid in diagnosis, surgical planning, and evaluation. Individual and combined modalities provide the surgeon and veterinary technician with specific information.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To evaluate the usefulness of serial compression B-scan and Doppler sonography (US) in screening for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities in patients with spinal cord injuries. Method Patients with paraplegia and tetraplegia due to spinal cord injuries were screened by a serial compression B-scan and Doppler US protocol for DVT of the bilateral lower extremities within the first 36 hours after admission, at day 7 and at day 21. In patients with DVT, a follow-up US examination was performed 3 weeks after diagnosis to assess thrombi distribution. Results Between January 2007 and March 2008, a total of 115 patients (75 males, 40 females), aged 19 to 85 years, were included. The first US examination documented a DVT in 44 cases (38.3%). After an initial negative scan, sonography after 7 days and 21 days showed DVT in 6 patients and 2 patients, respectively. Cumulative rate of DVT after the first 3 weeks was 45.2% (n=52). Follow-up US after 3 weeks in patients with DVT documented a complete recanalization in 19 patients (36.5%), no change in 12 patients (23.1%), and residual thrombi with partial recanalization in 21 patients (40.4%). Conclusion Our study supports the use of serial compression B-scan and Doppler US as a screening tool for DVT of the lower extremities in patients with spinal cord injuries early after injury. ? 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objectives The association between the use of forceps and levator ani muscle (LAM) avulsion seems to be clear-cut. However, whether the lesion is due to the mechanical trauma yielded by the instrument or to the intrinsic complexity of this type of delivery, is yet to be determined. This study aims at determining the difference in LAM avulsion rate between Kielland rotational forceps and non-rotational forceps. Study Design Prospective observational study with 94 nulliparous women with forceps-assisted deliveries (FD) between July 2015 and January 2016. 3D-TpUS was performed 6 months after every patient's delivery, during which LAM avulsion, and levator hiatus area and anteroposterior and transverse diameters were assessed. Results A total of 89 nulliparous were studied, comprising 27 rotational-FD, and 62 non-rotational-FD. No differences in obstetric, intrapartum, or neonatal characteristics were observed between study groups. There were no statistically significant differences in the presence of avulsion between cases of rotational forceps (44.4% vs 35.5%, OR: 1.5 [0.6-3.6]), correction of asinclitism of the fetal head (34.4% vs. 40.4% OR: 0.8 [0.3-1.9]) or station (midforceps: 32.8% vs low forceps: 50.0% OR: 2.0 [0.8-5.1]). Conclusions We have not observed differences in the LAM-avulsion rate between rotational forceps and non-rotational forceps performed by highly experienced personnel in instrumental deliveries.

AB  - Aim To investigate the potential usefulness of contrast enhanced three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler sonography in the differentiation of benign and malignant adnexal lesions. Methods A total of 31 patients with complex adnexal lesions of uncertain malignancy at transvaginal B mode and/or color Doppler sonography were prospectively evaluated with three-dimensional power Doppler sonography before and after injection of the contrast agent. Presence of a penetrating pattern and a mixed penetrating and peripheral pattern suggested adnexal malignancy. The results were compared with histopathology. Results There were 10 cases of ovarian malignancy and 21 benign adnexal lesions. Of the 10 ovarian cancers, 6 (60%) showed vascular distribution suggestive of malignancy at nonenhanced 3D power Doppler sonography. After injection of contrast agent, a penetrating vascular pattern and/or a mixed penetrating and peripheral pattern were detected in all cases of ovarian malignancy with two benign lesions (fibroma and cystadenofibroma) which were misdiagnosed as malignant. The use of a contrast agent with three-dimensional power Doppler sonography showed diagnostic efficiency (96.7%) that was superior to nonenhanced 3D power Doppler sonography (93.5%). Conclusion Contrast enhanced 3D power Doppler sonography provides better visualizatoin of tumor vascularity in complex adnexal masses. If used together with 3D morphological ultrasound assessment, enhanced 3D power Doppler imaging might precisely discriminate benign from malignant adnexal lesions.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to compare sonographic measurements of subcutaneous tissue (SQ) in fetuses of gestational diabetic mothers (GDM), and in normal fetuses. Methods SQ was measured as the subcutaneous tissue area of mid upper arm (FMA), mid-thigh (FMT) (cross sectional area minus bone and muscle area), abdominal (FA) and subscapular fat (FS), thickness. Fifty-six GDM were enrolled in the study. Normal values were obtained from fetuses of normal pregnancies (BMI 21.3?±?0.64 Kg/m2; one hour glucose test <?140?mg/dL) (30 patients). Treatment was based on diet alone, or diet plus insulin according to postprandial glicemia. Longitudinal ultrasound examinations were performed every four weeks, in normal pregnancies, and in GDM pregnancies. Results Fetal SQ measurements were significantly correlated to gestational age both in normal and GDM fetuses (P?<?0.05). At the time of diagnosis GDM fetuses had significantly higher values for all SQ measurements compared to AGA fetuses; these differences were not found during therapy. 26?32?weeks diagnosis 32?36?weeks therapy normal GDM normal GDM p FA 0.32?±?0.01 0.38?±?0.01 Ns 0.45?±?0.02 0.47?±?0.02 0.001 FS 0.28?±?0.01 0.36?±?0.17 Ns 0.41?±?0.36 0.44?±?0.02 0.001 FMA 1.97?±?0.12 2.55?±?0.19 Ns 3.83?±?0.33 4.24?±?0.21 0.01 FMT 3.12?±?0.20 4.10?±?0.37 Ns 5.91?±?0.42 6.94?±?0.43 0.01 Conclusions GDM is associated with increases in fetal SQ from the second trimester. A strict glycemic control can reduce these differences to negligible values. These new measurements can be adopted to monitor the efficacy of therapy in GDM pregnancies.

AB  - Echocardiography in the emergency room presents exciting practice possibilities that can facilitate prompt and reliable diagnostic evaluations in patients with suspected cardiovascular emergencies. Echocardiography has the diagnostic potentials to evaluate the entire spectrum of cardiovascular abnormalities short of delineating coronary anatomy and evaluation of the conduction system. By reliably assessing the global and regional function, visualizing the cardiovascular structures from multiple tomographic planes, and quantitating hemodynamic abnormalities, echocardiography should be able to assist emergency room physician's evaluation and triage of the patients with chest pain syndrome, unexplained dyspnea, hypotension, shock, chest trauma, and cardiac arrest, whereby hopefully minimizing the unnecessary admission to the hospital and facilitating inhospital evaluation of the admitted patients with echocardiographic information. However, the optimal echocardiography practice in the emergency room requires well trained sonongraphers and echocardiographers who can respond to the clinical needs at anytime. Whether an emergency room physician can perform and interpret echocardiographic examinations satisfactorily will depend on his/her level of training and continuing education in this area. Currently, there is no established guideline for performing echocardiography in the emergency room. Further clinical investigations are necessary to define the most optimal and economical utilization of this versatile imaging and hemodynamic diagnostic modality in the emergency room.

AB  - Background Ultrasonography is an effective diagnostic tool for identifying fetal urinary tract anomalies (UTA). Serious obstructive or dysgenetic abnormalities are often clearly detected and their implications well known. Less clear is the meaning of borderline (asymptomatic at birth) UTA, including: mild pyelectasis (MP), unilateral renal agenesis (URA), unilateral multicystic kidney (UMK) and ectopic kidney (EK). Method We determined the outcome of pregnancies and long-term renal function in 120 cases of prenatally detected borderline UTA. A prospective protocol was proposed to the parents which comprised ultrasound evaluation every 3?months until the age of 24?months, and renal function assessment in case of suspected worsening of prenatal findings. Results A total of 120 fetuses had a borderline UTA (MP n?=?58, URA n?=?14, UMK n?=?32, EK n?=?16). Eighteen of them showed some postnatal complication including: associated anomalies (3 cases), need for surgical intervention (6 cases), vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR, 5 cases) and repeated infection (4 cases). Conclusions Fetal pyelectasis, rarely requires neonatal intervention if the diameter of pelvis is included between 5 and 10?mm in the second trimester. Nevertheless, the risk of associated chromosome abnormalities should be ruled out if other risk factors are present. Unilateral multicystic kidney carries a high risk of nephrectomy and contralateral VUR, whereas unilateral agenesis or ectopic kidneys seem to carry limited, if any, negative implications, with the exception of possible undetected, associated anomalies.

AB  - Background Ultrasound guidance is now a standard nerve localization technique for peripheral nerve block (PNB). Ultrasonography allows simultaneous visualization of the target nerve, needle, local anesthetic injectate, and surrounding anatomical structures. Accurate deposition of local anesthetic next to the nerve is essential to the success of the nerve block procedure. Due to limitations in the visibility of both needle tip and nerve surface, the precise relationship between needle tip and target nerve is unknown at the moment of injection. Importantly, nerve injury may result both from an inappropriately placed needle tip and inappropriately placed local anesthetic. The relationship between the block needle tip and target nerve is of paramount importance to the safe conduct of peripheral nerve block. Methods This review summarizes the evolution of nerve localization in regional anesthesia, characterizes a problem faced by clinicians in performing ultrasound-guided nerve block, and explores the potential technological solutions to this problem. Results To date, technology newly applied to PNB includes real-time 3D imaging, multi-planar magnetic needle guidance, and inline injection pressure monitoring. This review postulates that optical reflectance spectroscopy and bioimpedance may allow for accurate identification of the relationship between needle tip and target nerve, currently a high priority deficit in PNB techniques. Conclusions Until it is known how best to define the relationship between needle and nerve at the moment of injection, some common sense principles are suggested.

AB  - Abstract Diagnosing pulmonary embolus (PE) remains one of the great challenges of emergency medicine. The diagnosis relies on a balance of probabilities rather than any definitive test. The probability is based on history, examination and investigations. The principal investigations are chest X-ray, arterial blood gas, electrocardiograph, ventilation perfusion scan, ultrasound and angiography where necessary. Newer techniques such as CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging will become more useful as the technology improves. Transoesophoegeal echocardiography is an important investigative tool for massive PE. Thrombolysis is increasingly being used in the management of PE and the higher risk of adverse outcome should be balanced against the probability of false positive results and the use of invasive angiography.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses various urinary and renal diseases in small animals. Disorders of the upper and lower urinary tract can produce nonspecific clinical signs including anorexia, gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, and weight loss. Several signs can be helpful in localizing disorders, and the discussed terminology is useful in describing clinical signs associated with disorders of the urinary tract. Patients with urinary tract disorders, and more specifically renal diseases, can have impaired metabolism and excretion abilities, putting them an increased risk for adverse events when administered certain medications and anesthetics. Patients with urinary tract diseases often require the administration of anesthesia for diagnostic and treatment procedures, making it important for nursing staff to understand how anesthetics can affect the renal patient. Abdominal ultrasound is a useful tool for identifying structural problems of the upper and lower urinary tract including stones, tumors, changes in kidney architecture such as pyelectasia, and evaluating for the presence of obstructions.

AB  - Key points Chronic mountain sickness (CMS) is a maladaptation syndrome encountered at high altitude (HA) characterised by severe hypoxaemia that carries a higher risk of stroke and migraine and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. We examined if exaggerated oxidative-inflammatory-nitrosative stress (OXINOS) and corresponding decrease in vascular nitric oxide bioavailability in patients with CMS (CMS+) is associated with impaired cerebrovascular function and adverse neurological outcome. Systemic OXINOS was markedly elevated in CMS+ compared to healthy HA (CMS?) and low-altitude controls. OXINOS was associated with blunted cerebral perfusion and vasoreactivity to hypercapnia, impaired cognition and, in CMS+, symptoms of depression. These findings are the first to suggest that a physiological continuum exists for hypoxaemia-induced systemic OXINOS in HA dwellers that when excessive is associated with accelerated cognitive decline and depression, helping identify those in need of more specialist neurological assessment and targeted support. Abstract Chronic mountain sickness (CMS) is a maladaptation syndrome encountered at high altitude (HA) characterised by severe hypoxaemia that carries a higher risk of stroke and migraine and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The present cross-sectional study examined to what extent exaggerated systemic oxidative-inflammatory-nitrosative stress (OXINOS), defined by an increase in free radical formation and corresponding decrease in vascular nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, is associated with impaired cerebrovascular function, accelerated cognitive decline and depression in CMS. Venous blood was obtained from healthy male lowlanders (80 m, n = 17), and age- and gender-matched HA dwellers born and bred in La Paz, Bolivia (3600 m) with (CMS+, n = 23) and without (CMS?, n = 14) CMS. We sampled blood for oxidative (electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, HPLC), nitrosative (ozone-based chemiluminescence) and inflammatory (fluorescence) biomarkers. We employed transcranial Doppler ultrasound to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) and reactivity. We utilised psychometric tests and validated questionnaires to assess cognition and depression. Highlanders exhibited elevated systemic OXINOS (P < 0.05 vs. lowlanders) that was especially exaggerated in the more hypoxaemic CMS+ patients (P < 0.05 vs. CMS?). OXINOS was associated with blunted cerebral perfusion and vasoreactivity to hypercapnia, impaired cognition and, in CMS+, symptoms of depression. Collectively, these findings are the first to suggest that a physiological continuum exists for hypoxaemia-induced OXINOS in HA dwellers that when excessive is associated with accelerated cognitive decline and depression, helping identify those in need of specialist neurological assessment and support.

AB  - Our first purpose was to describe embryonic anatomic structures by use of IUS with a 20-MHz flexible catheter-based, high resolutions, real-time miniature transducer. The number and the clarity of structures increased from 7 to 8?weeks of gestation; however, the image quality was degenerated because of the increasing fetal size at 9?weeks. At 8?weeks secondary brain vesicles, spine, midgut herniation, liver, upper and lower limb buds, and sacral tail were visualized in all fetuses. The four-chamber view was first identified at 8?weeks, as were fingers or toes. The stomach was first noted at 9?weeks. Second purpose was to compare the ultrasound visualization of the early first-trimester embryo using TVS and IUS as 6?8?weeks of gestation. The ability to view most organs was better with IUS compared to TVS, and this was especially true for the brain, spine, heart, liver, midgut herniation, extremities, and sacral tail. Moreover, it was possible to obtain finer image quality of very small embryonic structures with IUS than with TVS. Third purpose was to evaluate embryonic organ growth (liver, heart, and brain vesicles) using IUS in the early first trimester of pregnancy. The significant good correlation between each parameter and gestational age was obtained. Fourth purpose was to visualize normal embryonal surface anatomic structures using 3D-IUS at 7?9.9?weeks gestational age. At week 8, prominent forehead was evident, and upper and lower limbs and midgut herniation were clearly depicted. At week 9, fingers and toes were depicted as small digital rays, and the sacral tail protruded caudally. At week 10, embryonic face and fingers were clearly shown.

AB  - This retrospective study of 143 pediatric patients with unilateral acute scrotal disease was done to assess the value of duplex Doppler sonographic examination prior to puberty (110 patients) in comparison to a pubertal group (33 patients) in a pediatric hospital, where the examinations are done by staff radiologists and radiology residents of varying degrees of expertise and experience with Doppler technique. All patients seen during an 18 month period were included. The unaffected side was examined in most patients and served as control. The normal Doppler shift in the center of the prepubertal testis was found to be 0.2 to 0.5 kHz, when using a 5 MHz duplex Doppler probe. With puberty, the Doppler shift increased to 0.5 to 1 kHz. Of 18 patients (10 prepubertal) with testicular torsion, five (three prepubertal) had false-positive Doppler shift. In four of these five cases, faulty placement of the Doppler sample volume cursor was probably the cause. Using a multi-way frequency analysis, puberty was found to have no significant influence on results of Doppler signal (chi square = 0.1346; P = 0.7137). Duplex Doppler sonographic examination is as useful to rule out testicular torsion in prepubertal boys as it is after puberty. Meticulous technique is essential. The opposite side should be examined first and serves as control for the affected one. Results showing no flow in the center of the diseased testis with positive flow in the unaffected one should lead to further clinical action (scintigraphy or surgery).

AB  - Abstract Purpose To assess outcome of phacoemulsification in cats. Methods Records of 71 cats (82 eyes) from five referral centers were reviewed. Groups were divided by cause of cataract (congenital/juvenile [n = 32], traumatic [n = 33], and secondary to uveitis [n = 6]), and group comparisons were performed for the most common complications: postoperative ocular hypertension (POH), uveitis, corneal ulceration, synechia/dyscoria, and posterior capsular opacity (PCO) in three different time periods: immediately postoperatively, at 1-90 days, and at >90 days. Results Median follow-up was 198 days (interquartile range 64-518 days). The overall visual success rate of the cats with a 12-month follow-up was 92.6% (25/27 eyes). POH occurred in 35/82 (42.6%) eyes. Immediately postoperatively, uveitis was the most common complication in 28/82 eyes (34.1%) followed by corneal ulceration in 22/82 eyes (26.8%). At 1-90 days, uveitis in 41/81 eyes (50.6%) remained the most common complication, followed by synechia/dyscoria in 21/81 eyes (25.9%), corneal ulceration in 16/81 eyes (19.7%), and PCO in 15/81 eyes (18.5%). At >90 days, PCO in 17/47 eyes (36.1%), followed by synechia/dyscoria in 16/47 eyes (34%), was the most common complications. The number of eyes with synechia/dyscoria in the trauma group was higher (13/33 [39.3%]) than in the congenital/juvenile group (5/31 [16.1%]) at 1-90 days (P = .039). No statistical difference was found for the other group comparisons. Three eyes in total were enucleated owing to endophthalmitis, post-traumatic ocular sarcoma, and secondary glaucoma. Conclusion Uveitis in the short-term and PCO and synechia/dyscoria in the long-term were the most common complications following phacoemulsification in cats.

AB  - Objectives To determine the value of Doppler flow velocity waveforms from the fetal arterial pulmonary branches relative to fetal biometric indices and clinical correlates in the prenatal prediction of lethal lung hypoplasia (LH) in prolonged oligohydramnios. Study design 42 singleton pregnancies with oligohydramnios associated with premature rupture of membranes (PROM, n?=?31) or bilateral renal pathology (n?=?11) were examined using a combined color coded Doppler and 2d real-time ultrasound system. Thoracic (TC), cardiac (CC) and abdominal circumference (AC) and the largest vertical amniotic fluid pocket were measured. Pulsed Doppler measurements of the arterial pulmonary branches were made at the level of the cardiac four-chamber view after visualization with color Doppler. Diagnosis of LH was based on pathological, clinical and radiological criteria. Results The prevalence of lethal LH was 43%. In the PROM-subset, combination of onset of PROM = 20?weeks; duration of oligohydramnios = 8?weeks and degree of oligohydramnios = 1?cm, presented the highest clinical prediction rate for lethal LH. For both the total group and the PROM-subset, the highest prediction rate for lethal LH from biometric and Doppler parameters was presented by TC/AC ratio, peak systolic velocity in the proximal branch and time-averaged and end-diastolic velocity in the middle branch of the pulmonary artery. In the prom subset, combination of all three clinical, biometric and Doppler parameters revealed the most favorable combination to predict lethal LH (PPV 100%, accuracy 93%, and sensitivity 71%). Conclusion Doppler velocimetry may detect changes in blood velocity waveforms from the arterial branches of the fetal pulmonary circulation in the presence of LH, but fails to be the ultimate test for the prenatal prediction of lethal LH. The best prediction can be achieved by combining clinical, biometric and Doppler parameters.

AB  - Purpose No randomized controlled trials of treatment of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) exist. Since severely preterm neonatal survival has increased over time, survival as an outcome measure is confounded by calendar time. The diagnosis-to-delivery interval is a calendar year independent measure of success of treatment. We wished to evaluate whether treatment of TTTS is associated with a lengthening of the diagnosis-to-delivery interval. Methods MEDLINE search supplemented by careful reference review. All TTTS series were included where the following information on each patient was available: survival, fetal demise, gestational age (GA) at diagnosis and diagnosis to delivery interval in days. Inclusion criteria GA?≤?29?weeks and diagnosis by ultrasound in the absence of maternal symptoms. Cases undergoing multiple types of treatment were excluded. Data were evaluated by Kruskal?Wallis anova, logistic regression & Wilcoxon rank sum testing. Results The 8 publications used included the following cases: controls (n?=?16), amnioreduction (n?=?61), septostomy (n?=?12), and fetoscopic laser occlusion of chorioangiopagus vessels (FLOC) (n?=?51). FLOC therapy showed a significantly longer diagnosis-to-delivery interval compared to amnioreduction (median 75 vs. 56?days) (p?=?0.01). There was no difference in overall survival, at least one survivor, or number of fetal deaths between the 4 groups. Logistic regression using at least one survivor as the dependent variable revealed a positive association with GA at diagnosis and with diagnosis to delivery interval, a negative correlation with fetal death, and no correlation with treatment group. Conclusions FLOC therapy for TTTS is associated with a longer diagnosis-to-delivery interval compared to amnioreduction without a significant increase in survival. The lack of increase in survival appears to be due to a small sample size.
