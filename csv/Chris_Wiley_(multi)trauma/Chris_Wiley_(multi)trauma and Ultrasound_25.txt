AB  - Objective To analyse the associations between delivery mode and symptoms and signs of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) in a cohort of symptomatic women. Design Retrospective observational study. Population A total of 1258 consecutive women attending a tertiary urogynaecological unit for the investigation of lower urinary tract or pelvic floor disorders between January 2012 and December 2014. Methods Obstetric history and clinical examination data were obtained from the unit database. Prolapse quantification on imaging was performed using stored four-dimensional translabial ultrasound volume data sets. Women were grouped into four groups according to the most traumatic delivery reported. The presence of symptoms and signs of POP were compared between delivery groups while controlling for potential confounders. Main outcome measures Prolapse symptoms, visual analogue score for prolapse bother, International Continence Society Prolapse Quantification System findings and ultrasound findings of anterior, central and posterior compartment descent. Results Nulliparae showed the lowest prevalence of most measures of POP, followed by women exclusively delivered by caesarean section. Highest prevalences were consistently found in women delivered at least once by forceps, although the differences between this group and women delivered by normal vaginal delivery and/or vacuum extraction were significant in three out of eight measures only. Compared with women in the caesarean section group, the adjusted odds ratios for reporting symptoms of prolapse were 2.4 (95% CI 1.30?4.59) and 3.2 (95% CI 1.65?6.12) in the normal vaginal delivery/vacuum extraction group and forceps group, respectively. Conclusions There is a clear link between vaginal delivery and symptoms and signs of pelvic organ prolapse in urogynaecological patients. Tweetable abstract Compared with caesarean section a history of vaginal delivery more than doubles the risk for POP.

AB  - A 9-year-old, female neutered Dalmatian was evaluated for acute onset of dyspnoea. Thoracocentesis on presentation yielded 1300 ml sanguineous fluid, while thoracic radiology and ultrasonography showed a mixed-echoic cavitary cranial mediastinal mass, sternal lymph node enlargement and pleural effusion. Surgical exploration of the thorax revealed a multi-lobulated red/brown cranial mediastinal mass and multiple similarly coloured ovoid nodules within several lung lobes. Histopathology revealed thymic branchial cysts with neoplastic transformation and examination of the lung was consistent with metastasis. Despite initially recovering well, acute sepsis and pyothorax resulted in cardiac arrest 8 days postoperatively. This is the first veterinary report of neoplastic transformation of a thymic branchial cyst with pulmonary metastasis.

AB  - Abstract Accurate assessment of the pregnant patient in the ED depends on knowledge of physiological changes in pregnancy, and how these changes may impact on pathology tests, appearance on point-of-care ultrasound and electrocardiography. In addition the emergency physician needs to be cognisant of disorders that are unique to or more common in pregnancy. Part 1 of this review addresses potential deviations in laboratory investigation reference intervals resulting from physiological alterations in pregnancy, and the important causes of abnormal laboratory results in pregnancy. Part 2 will address the role of point-of-care ultrasound in pregnancy, physiological changes that may affect interpretation of point-of-care ultrasound, physiological changes in electrocardiography, and the safety of radiological procedures in the pregnant patient.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on important conditions of the female and male reproductive tracts. The focused reproductive exam can diagnose pregnancy and pseudopregnancy, medically manage pyometra, determine causes of scrotal swelling, and screen for prostatic pathology. Some indications for the focused reproductive exam include dystocia, vaginal discharge, scrotal and testicular swellings, and cryptorchidism. The major structure involved in most concerning conditions of the bitch or queen is the uterus, and its two major problems are pyometra and dystocia. Cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH)-pyometra complex is the most frequent and important uterine disorder in bitches. The initial physical exam finding of purulent vaginal discharge should be an immediate trigger for performing an ultrasound exam to determine the presence of pyometra. The male less commonly has indications for the focused reproductive exam. The ultrasonographic appearance of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) is enlarged and uniformly hyperechoic with a smooth margin.

AB  - Abstract Objective Comparison of contingent, step-wise and integrated screening policies. Methods Mid-trimester Down syndrome risks were retrospectively calculated from FaSTER trial data. For contingent screening, initial risk was calculated from ultrasound measurement of nuchal translucency (NT), maternal serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein (PAPP)-A and free ?-human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) at 11?13 weeks, and classified positive (>1 in 30), borderline (1 in 30?1500) or negative. Borderline risks were recalculated using α-fetoprotein, hCG, unconjugated estriol (uE3) and inhibin at 15?18 weeks, and reclassified as positive (>1 in 270) or negative. For step-wise screening, initial negative risks were also recalculated. For integrated screening, a single risk was calculated from NT, PAPP-A and the second trimester markers. Results There were 86 Down syndrome and 32 269 unaffected pregancies. The detection rate for contingent screening was 91% and false-positive rate was 4.5%; initial detection rate was 60%, initial false-positive rate was 1.2% and borderline risk was 23%. Step-wise screening had 92% detection rate and 5.1% false-positive rate; integrated screening had 88% and 4.9% respectively. Conclusion As predicted by modelling, the contingent screening detection rate for a fixed false-positive rate is comparable with step-wise and integrated screening, but substantially reduces the number needing to return for second trimester testing.

AB  - Abstract Retinal degeneration (RD) results in photoreceptor loss and irreversible visual impairments. This study sought to alleviate the photoreceptor degeneration via the adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated erythropoietin (EPO) therapy. AAV-2/2-mCMV-EPO vectors were constructed and delivered into the subretinal space of a RD model. The retinal morphology, optokinetic behaviour and electrophysiological function of the treated animals were analysed. The subretinal delivery of AAV-2/2 vectors induced robust EPO gene expressions in the retinas. AAV2/2-mediated EPO therapy ameliorated the photoreceptor degeneration and visual impairments of the RD animal model. Furthermore, the multi-electrodes array (MEA) was used to detect the firing activities of retinal ganglion cells. MEA recording showed that the EPO therapy could restrain the spontaneous firing response, enhance the light-induced firing response and preserve the basic configurations of visual signal pathway in RD model. Our MEA assay provided an example to evaluate the potency of pharmacological compounds on retinal plasticity. In conclusion, AAV2/2-mediated EPO therapy can ameliorate the photoreceptor degeneration and rectify the abnormities in visual signal transmission. These beneficial results suggest the AAV vector is a viable therapeutic option for retinopathies with rapidly degenerating kinetics and lay the groundwork for future development of EPO gene therapy.

AB  - Objective? To describe the clinical presentation, ultrasound findings, management and outcome in horses with muscle tear injuries of the hindlimbs. Design? Retrospective case series Procedure? Medical records of eight horses were reviewed and information on signalment, history, presenting complaint, physical examination findings and further diagnostic tests were recorded. Diagnosis of muscle injury was determined by the presence of abnormal ultrasound findings, compared with the contralateral limb, and, when required, nuclear scintigraphy. Follow-up information was obtained via telephone interviews with owners, trainers and referring veterinarians. Results? Muscle tears causing lameness were identified in the middle gluteal (3), semitendinosus (1), semimembranosus (2) and gracilis (2) muscles. Tears were classified by ultrasound imaging as partial (6) or complete (2). The degree of lameness did not appear to be indicative of the extent of injury or of completion of healing. Long-term follow-up was available for seven horses and the outcome was favourable in six cases. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Ultrasonography is useful in the diagnosis and assessment of moderate to severe muscle strain injuries. The prognosis appears to be favourable in most cases, although recurrence of injury and lameness can delay the return to athletic activity and an inferior outcome with persistent gait abnormality may occur.

AB  - Summary Nonheart beating donation (NHBD) of the liver is a relatively new potential source of grafts. Guidelines to indications and contraindications to donation from controlled nonheart beating donors are still being formulated. We report a successful case of transplantation of a liver from a controlled nonheart beating donor who sustained significant injuries following a road traffic accident. Emergency laparotomy with peri-hepatic packing was performed to control haemorrhage from lacerations in segments VI and VII. Forceful packing resulted in an area of focal ischaemia in segment VI. Trauma to the liver should not be considered an absolute contraindication to controlled NHBD.

AB  - Abstract Shoulder injuries are a commonly presenting complaint to the ED. In the absence of an obvious deformity, they can be difficult to assess and definitively diagnose because of the multiple structures that cause shoulder pain, the acuity and severity of pain and the lack of range of motion in the ED setting. The quality of ED care provided to patients with musculoskeletal shoulder pain is crucial to ensure the best possible outcomes for the patient. This rapid review investigated best practice for the assessment and management of common shoulder injuries and conditions in the ED. Databases were searched in 2017, including PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, TRIP and the grey literature, including relevant organisational websites. Primary studies, systematic reviews and guidelines published in English-language in the past 12?years that addressed the acute assessment, management, follow-up plan or prognosis were considered for inclusion. Data extraction of included articles was conducted, followed by quality appraisal to rate the level of evidence. The search revealed 1902 articles, of which 73 were included in the review (n =?12 primary articles, n =?49 systematic reviews and n =?12 guidelines). This rapid review provides clinicians who manage shoulder dislocations, fractures and soft tissue injuries in the ED a summary of the best available evidence to enhance the quality of care for optimal patient outcomes. There is strong evidence to support taking a thorough history and physical examination, with cautious use of special tests because of their poor diagnostic accuracy. Key points regarding the diagnosis and management of these injuries are provided.

AB  - Objective To compare surgical trauma, perioperative pain, surgical time, and complication rate in mares undergoing standing bilateral ovariectomy by natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) or laparoscopy. Study Design Experimental study. Animals Healthy mares (n = 12). Methods Ovariectomy was performed with a vessel-sealing device by transvaginal NOTES (n = 6) using a flexible endoscope and specialized instruments or by bilateral flank laparoscopy (n = 6). Preoperative and postoperative complete blood count (CBC), plasma fibrinogen concentration, serum amyloid A concentration, peritoneal nucleated cell count, and total protein concentration were compared using repeated measures ANOVA. Surgical times were compared using an unpaired t-test. Mares were monitored for 2 weeks postoperatively and necropsy was performed at 3 weeks (n = 6) or 3 months (n = 6) to assess short- and medium-term effects of each procedure. Complication rate, necropsy, and bacteriology findings were compared using a Fishers exact test. Significance was set at P < .05. Results All surgical procedures were performed successfully and all but one laparoscopy mare were bright, alert, and maintained a good appetite until euthanasia. Mean ± SD surgical time was similar between groups (NOTES: 100 ± 40 minutes; laparoscopy: 107 ± 47 minutes). There were no significant temporal differences in vital parameters, CBC, plasma fibrinogen concentration, serum amyloid A concentration, peritoneal nucleated cell count, and total protein concentration between groups. Conclusions Bilateral ovariectomy by transvaginal NOTES or laparoscopy resulted in minimal inflammation and surgical trauma.

AB  - Summary.? Current diagnostic management of hemodynamically stable patients with clinically suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE) consists of the accurate and rapid distinction between the approximate 20?25% of patients who have acute PE and require anticoagulant treatment, and the overall majority of patients who do not have the disease in question. Clinical outcome studies have demonstrated that, using algorithms with sequential diagnostic tests, PE can be safely ruled out in patients with a clinical probability indicating PE to be unlikely and a normal D-dimer test result. This obviates the need for additional radiological imaging tests in 20?40% of patients. CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has become the first line tool to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of PE in patients with a likely probability of PE or an elevated D-dimer blood concentration. While single-row-detector technology CTPA has a low sensitivity for PE and bilateral compression ultrasound (CUS) of the lower limbs is considered necessary to rule out PE, multi-row-detector CTPA is safe to exclude PE without the confirmatory use of CUS.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine the predictive values of haematuria and hydronephrosis in suspected renal colic. Methods We undertook a retrospective audit of adult patients who received a computed tomography (CT) of the kidneys, ureter and bladder (CTKUB) for suspected renal colic, presenting to Eastern Health Emergency Departments in Melbourne, Australia, between 1 January 2016 and 30 June 2016. CT hydronephrosis was used as a substitute for ultrasound hydronephrosis. We looked at the association of haematuria and CT proven hydronephrosis with CT proven ureteric and obstructing pelvic calculi. Results Of 769 adult cases who received a CTKUB for suspected renal colic, 384 were positive (49.9%) and 385 were negative (50.1%). For haematuria and renal colic, sensitivity was 87.3% (83.3?90.7), specificity 33.8% (28.9?39.0), positive predictive value (PPV) 55.7% (53.7?57.8), negative predictive value (NPV) 73.6% (67.1?79.3). For CT hydronephrosis and renal colic, sensitivity was 88.0% (84.2?91.1), specificity 85.0% (80.9?88.5), PPV 85.7% (82.4?88.5), NPV 87.4% (84.0?90.2). Of 110 cases with both negative CT hydronephrosis and negative haematuria, four had ureteric calculi, NPV 96.4% (90.8?98.6). Conclusion This audit suggests that a diagnostic strategy relying on the absence of haematuria or hydronephrosis, or both, to rule out ureteric calculi may result in a small number of stones being missed.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Yellow fat disease or steatitis is characterised by a local or general inflammation of fat tissue and is occasionally found in horses. Diagnosis is challenging because of the wide range of nonspecific clinical signs. Objectives To describe clinical signs, treatment, outcome and ultrasonographic findings in horses with steatitis. Study design Retrospective study (January 2008 to January 2015). Methods History, clinical signs, ultrasonographic findings, diagnosis, treatment and outcome were recorded. Results Twenty cases (18 horses, 2 donkeys; 9 mares, 9 stallions, 2 geldings) were retrieved from 13,707 patient records. Mean age was 1.6 (±?0.8) years (range 1 month?3.5 years). All cases appeared between October and February except for one (August). History included dullness, recumbency, decreased appetite and weight loss. Fever, ventral oedema, stiff/painful gait and painful neck were found. Low haematocrit, low vitamin E and selenium and increased levels of creatinine kinase and particularly lactate dehydrogenase were almost consistent findings. On ultrasound, ventral oedema was found. Subperitoneal, perirenal, mesenteric, coronary and caudal mediastinal fat showed homogenously increased echogenicity. Especially the subperitoneal fat was surrounded by oedema or free fluid. Increased amounts of abdominal, thoracic and pericardial fluid were often found. Fat biopsies were taken in the neck or from the retroperitoneal fat in the ventral flank. In all horses where fat biopsy was taken (n?=?13), steatitis was confirmed. Treatment consisted of selenium and vitamin E (intra-muscular injection followed by oral treatment) supplementation and anti-inflammatory treatment (dexamethasone or prednisolone parenteral or oral) for at least 1?4 weeks. Fourteen animals (70%) survived. Full recovery took about 2?6 months. Conclusions Yellow fat disease may be underdiagnosed because of the nonspecific clinical signs. Ultrasound was extremely helpful for making a diagnosis. Recovery was rather slow but was achieved in 70% of the animals.

AB  - Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is an invaluable diagnostic tool, particularly in patients with inadequate transthoracic echocardiographic examinations. In addition, continuous TEE has been used to monitor ventricular and valvular performance in the intensive care unit and the operating room. However, current generation transesophageal probes have limitations in the critical care setting due to their size. Recently, a prototype miniaturized transesophageal probe was developed to overcome these limitations. This probe was used by five medical centers for 194 examinations. A large proportion of these patients were in the intensive care unit (43%), as well as mechanically ventilated (39%). Seventy percent (70%) of the subjects in this study were intubated nasally with the prototype probe, with a success rate of 88.5%. Oral intubation was successful in every case. Subject tolerance was good, and 25% of the patients were intubated for > 1 h. Nasal intubation with the probe was more likely in intensive care patients, ventilated subjects, and patients who were intubated for > 1 hour. TEE with this miniaturized probe is feasible and safe even in multi-instrumented critical care patients. This probe provides adequate diagnostic imaging capabilities and may allow imaging over prolonged periods of time, making it suitable for the serial monitoring of ventricular performance.

AB  - Abstract We present a case of 80-year-old man who had headache of 1?day duration and gross subdural haemorrhage in the absence of any history of noticeable trauma, leading to descending transtentorial herniation and secondary brain stem haemorrhages called Duret haemorrhages. It is rare to find a Duret haemorrhage on imaging. This case has been presented to highlight the rarity of the condition and the unusual posterior location of the bleed and also the universally fatal nature of these haemorrhages. Relevant literature is reviewed.

AB  - Abstract Background: The aim of the present study was to retrospectively determine the clinical factors affecting the outcome after birth in prenatally diagnosed sacrococcygeal teratomas (SCT). Methods: Six cases of prenatal SCT were identified from January 1985 until August 2005. A retrospective review of case-notes and pathological reports was carried out. Clinical data during the perinatal period, operative findings, postoperative complications and follow up were evaluated in the patients with prenatally diagnosed SCT. Results: SCT presented as type I in two neonates and type III in four between 22 and 33?weeks? gestation. Fetal intervention was not performed for any fetus. Five of six were delivered by cesarean section and the other was delivered vaginally due to small tumor size. Patients were born at between 29 and 39?weeks? gestation and weighed from 1840 to 3500?g. All patients with type III SCT presented with related diseases, including bilateral hydronephrosis, neurological deficit of the communicating peroneal nerve such as paralytic talipes equines, bladder or bowel dysfunction, high-output cardiac failure, or fetal hydrops in one of a set of fraternal twins. A baby with high-output cardiac failure and fetal hydrops underwent urgent cesarean section at 29?weeks? gestation and died 8?days after birth despite intensive care due to multi-organ failure. In five cases, surgery was successful with good outcomes maintained at follow-up of between 8?months and 14?years. Conclusions: Detailed ultrasound should be performed to rule out associated anomalies, and determine the presence or absence of hydrops in prenatally diagnosed SCT. Fetal hydrops, orthopedic impairment such as lower extremity weakness and swelling, and urinary incontinence are important clinical factors affecting the outcome after birth in prenatally diagnosed SCT. In particular, the present study indicated that the association of a fraternal twin and fetal hydrops makes it very difficult to treat SCT perinatally.
