AB  - Abstract A case of complex microsurgical reconstruction of the dorsum of the foot, including tendon transfer following tumor resection, in a 15-week-old male infant is presented. After birth, a 5.5 ? 4 cm large tumor was observed on the dorsum of the right foot. Biopsy showed a congenital malignant fibro sarcoma. After initial chemotherapy a radical excision of the tumor at the age of 14 weeks was followed. To cover the defect a musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi flap was taken, the cutaneous part being large enough to cover the defect. Extensor tendons were reconstructed with free tendon transplants. Amputation is usually indicated in these cases. To the best of our knowledge, microsurgical reconstruction in infants at this age with congenital malignant tumors has not yet been reported. The case shows that Plastic surgery can play an important role in pediatric oncology and should routinely be integrated into the multi-modal treatment concepts. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Although increasing evidences emphasize the importance of early cardiovascular evaluation in men with erectile dysfunction (ED) of unexplained aetiology, impaired masturbation-induced erections in young men are usually overlooked and habitually presumed to be psychological origin. Aims To evaluate the young men presenting weaker masturbatory erection with no sexual intercourse (WME-NS) and verify if this cohort have early cardiovascular risks associated with ED. Methods Male subjects aged 18?40 years with WME-NS were screened by analyzing detailed sexual intercourse and masturbatory history. The age-matched ED and non-ED population were identified by using International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5). All subjects with acute and/or chronic diseases (including diagnosed hypertension and diabetes) and long-term pharmacotherapy were excluded. Nocturnal penile tumescence and rigidity (NPTR), systemic vascular parameters and biochemical indicators related to metabolism were assessed. Main Outcome Measures Comparison analysis and logistic regression analysis were conducted among WME-NS, ED and non-ED population. Results In total, 78 WME-NS cases (mean 28.99?±?5.92 years), 179 ED cases (mean 30.69?±?5.21 years) and 43 non-ED cases (mean 28.65?±?4.30 years) were screened for analysis. Compared with non-ED group, WME-NS group had higher prevalence of early ED risk factors including endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, high level of glycosylated serum protein and abnormal NPTR. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression analysis showed endothelia dysfunction (odds ratio: 8.83 vs. 17.11, both P?<?0.001) was the independent risk factor for both WME-NS and ED. Conclusions Weaker masturbatory erection may be a sign of early cardiovascular risk associated with ED in young men without sexual intercourse. More studies are warranted to elucidate the clinical benefits by targeting these formulated strategies. Huang Y-P, Chen B, Yao F-J, Chen S-F, Ouyang B, Deng C-H, and Huang Y-R.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the sonomorphologic changes of the female pelvic floor after childbirth. Furthermore the timing of the appearance of these defects labor are examined. Methods We examined three groups of patients. 104 primiparae after vaginal delivery, 26 primiparae after elective cesarean section and 77 primiparae after secondary cesarean section within 3?7?days after delivery. To assess the morphology of the pelvic floor we used to examine the anal morphology, whereas the transrectal route was used to assess the paraurethral fixation of the lateral vaginal edges. Paravaginal defect was defined as descent of the lateral vaginal edges below the suburethral portion of the vagina and defects of the internal anal sphincter is defined by anterior vs. posterior thickness-ratio below 0.5. Clinical symptoms were documented using a standardized questionnaire. Results Primiparae after elective cesarean section served as control group. After vaginal delivery 7.3% of women showed urinary and 17.7% anal incontinence. Mode of delivery is significantly associated with anal and urinary incontinence. Paraurethral defect is predictive for urinary incontinence. Morphological defects of the pelvic floor could be documented after dilatation of the cervix to more than 7?cm. Conclusions Volume sonography after childbirth allows to document trauma to the pelvic floor due to vaginal delivery. Defects of the anterior compartment are predictive for the development of urinary incontinence. To study the timing of the appearance of pelvic floor defects during the course of vaginal delivery may be helpful for obstetrical decision making.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare the orofacial muscle strength and facial muscle thickness between resistance-trained and non-resistance trained men and women. Methods Resistance-trained (25 men and 22 women) and non-resistance trained (21 men and 30 women) adults (18-40?years) had standard measurements of orofacial muscle strength (ie, anterior tongue elevation, cheek compression, and lip compression) and ultrasound measurements of facial muscle thickness. Body composition (percent fat, etc.) was estimated using ultrasound prediction Equations. A Bayesian analysis of variance (ANOVA) with between subject factors of training status (yes/no) and sex (man/woman) were used to determine differences in muscle size and strength. Results Body mass, height, and percent fat were similar between resistance-trained and non-resistance trained individuals, while appendicular lean mass was higher in resistance-trained. There were no differences in orofacial muscle strength between resistance-trained and non-resistance trained. However, men had greater strength in every task except for anterior tongue strength which was similar between sexes (men: 66 vs women: 64?kPa). Handgrip strength was greater in men and in those who were resistance-trained. The frontalis muscle was greater in women than in men and in those who were non-resistance-trained than those resistance-trained. None of the other muscles differed by training status, however, all were greater in men. Conclusion Results from our cross-sectional study would suggest that exercise-stimulation to the facial muscles during resistance training of the limbs and trunk did not reach a level where orofacial muscle strength could be changed. Sex differences in facial muscle thickness are very unique, although the reasons are unclear.

AB  - Introduction? Trauma teams and cardiac arrest teams provide an urgent and expert multi-disciplinary response to time critical emergencies. The present study documents the contribution of a medical emergency team (MET) to managing non-trauma surgical emergencies. Materials and Methods? Data was prospectively collected over a two year period concerning the contribution of medical emergency teams to the resuscitation of all patients with non-trauma surgical emergencies and altered vital signs in hospital wards. Results? Over the study period, the details of 19 patients with surgical emergencies were recorded. 63% of emergencies occurred outside of normal working hours. In 53% of cases, the surgical registrar was off-site or physically unavailable to attend the emergency immediately. In 11% of cases, the medical emergency team was activated prior to the arrival of the surgical registrar. In 26% of cases, the patient was left unattended whilst awaiting arrival of the surgical registrar. The medical emergency team provided resuscitation procedures and arranged urgent investigations in all patients, physically transported the patient to the operating theatre in 16% of patients and prepared for general anaesthetic in the operating theatre in 11% of cases. The surgical registrar complemented the medical emergency team response by liaising with consultant surgeons, anaesthetists and operating theatre staff in all cases. All patients received definitive treatment within 30 minutes of MET response. Conclusion? Routine use of medical emergency teams in the initial resuscitation of patients with surgical emergencies expedites definitive management.

AB  - Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a wide range of disabilities that cause life-long cognitive impairment and social, communication, and behavioral challenges. Early diagnosis and medical intervention are important for improving the life quality of autistic patients. However, in the current practice, diagnosis often has to be delayed until the behavioral symptoms become evident during childhood. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of using machine learning techniques for identifying high-risk ASD infants at as early as six months after birth. This is based on the observation that ASD-induced abnormalities in white matter (WM) tracts and whole-brain connectivity have already started to appear within 24 months after birth. In particular, we propose a novel multikernel support vector machine classification framework by using the connectivity features gathered from WM connectivity networks, which are generated via multiscale regions of interest (ROIs) and multiple diffusion statistics such as fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and average fiber length. Our proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 76% and an area of 0.80 under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), in comparison to the accuracy of 70% and the AUC of 70% provided by the best single-parameter single-scale network. The improvement in accuracy is mainly due to the complementary information provided by multiparameter multiscale networks. In addition, our framework also provides the potential imaging connectomic markers and an objective means for early ASD diagnosis. Hum Brain Mapp 36:4880?4896, 2015. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary A 5-year-old Rheinlander gelding was evaluated for left hindlimb stifle lameness. The lameness was localised to the stifle, but source of the lameness was not specifically diagnosed from the physical, radiographic and ultrasonographic examinations. Computed tomography (CT) and CT arthrography were therefore used for further investigation since these imaging techniques image bony structures, cartilage and soft tissues. This examination showed multiple lesions in the stifle: an osteochondrosis dissecans like lesion of the medial femoral condyle, bony fragments, cartilage trauma and caudal cruciate ligament injury. The prognosis for continuing use as a sports horse was regarded as unfavourable. Therefore, the horse was subjected to euthanasia. All CT findings were confirmed by gross pathology. The CT and CT arthrography examination in this case provided a diagnosis not achieved with other conventional imaging techniques.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To describe the clinical course of a dog presented with peliosis hepatis and hemoperitoneum in concert with anticoagulant rodenticide intoxication. Case summary: A 7.75-year-old spayed female Shetland Sheepdog presented with clinical signs consistent with hypovolemia, hemoperitoneum, and a history of bright green stool 3 days before the onset of clinical signs. Initial packed cell volume/total solids were consistent with acute hemorrhage. A coagulation profile showed prolongation in activated clotting time and prolongation of both prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time, suggesting abnormal coagulation. Abdominal hemorrhage persisted in the face of normalization of the hemodynamic status and coagulation profile, and treatment with Vitamin K1. Abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple patchy hypoechoic areas throughout the caudate liver lobe. An exploratory laparotomy was performed 24 hours after presentation and revealed the caudate liver lobe as the source of the hemorrhage. Histopathologic examination of a specimen of the liver was consistent with peliosis hepatis. Toxicologic testing identified diphacinone levels in the blood consistent with anticoagulant rodenticide intoxication. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and within 48 hours the dog was discharged. The dog returned to full function and a hepatic ultrasound performed 15 months postoperatively showed no significant abnormalities. New or unique information provided: Exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides may be associated with the development of peliosis hepatis in dogs.

AB  - Abstract Objective To review the prevalence and perinatal management of cases of arthrogryposis delivering at our hospital over a 6-year period. Methods This was a retrospective review of cases of arthrogryposis managed at a UK teaching hospital. Cases were identified from the regional congenital anomalies register and departmental databases. Case notes were reviewed and analysed. Results From 2002 to 2007, there were 27 cases of arthrogryposis. Sixteen (59.3%) were Caucasians, 7(25.9%) Asians and 4(14.8%) Afro-Caribbean; 17(63%) were nulliparous. In eight (29.6%) cases, there was a family history of congenital anomalies. Three had previously affected siblings and in three cases the parents were affected with arthrogryposis. Five (18.5%) were from consanguineous families. Eighteen (66.7%) cases were diagnosed prenatally at a mean gestational age of 21 weeks. Twelve (57%) were delivered by caesarean section. There were 18 live births. Sixteen (59%) cases were reviewed by clinical geneticist. Following detailed review and investigation including post-mortems, 20 (74%) of our cases had a formal diagnosis or likely cause identified. Conclusions Suspected cases of arthrogryposis require multi-disciplinary management to optimise the possibility of making a diagnosis and providing parents with accurate information to enable them to make informed choices regarding the pregnancy and providing information regarding likelihood of recurrence.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The use of alveolar recruitment maneuvers during general anaesthesia of horses is a potentially useful therapeutic option for the ventilatory management. While the routine application of recruitments would benefit from the availability of dedicated large animal ventilators their impact on ventilation and perfusion in the horse is not yet well documented nor completely understood. Case history A healthy 533 kg experimental horse underwent general anaesthesia in lateral recumbency. During intermittent positive pressure ventilation a stepwise alveolar recruitment maneuver was performed. Management Anaesthesia was induced with ketamine and midazolam and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen using a large animal circle system. Mechanical ventilation was applied in pressure ventilation mode and an alveolar recruitment maneuver performed employing a sequence of ascending and descending positive end expiratory pressures. Next to the standard monitoring, which included spirometry, additionally three non-invasive monitoring techniques were used: electrical impedance tomography (EIT), volumetric capnography and respiratory ultrasonic plethysmography. The functional images continuously delivered by EIT initially showed markedly reduced ventilation in the dependent lung and allowed on-line monitoring of the dynamic changes in the distribution of ventilation during the recruitment maneuver. Furthermore, continuous monitoring of compliance, dead space fraction, tidal volumes and changes in end expiratory lung volume were possible without technical difficulties. Follow up The horse made an unremarkable recovery. Conclusion The novel non-invasive monitoring technologies used in this study provided unprecedented insights into the physiology of lung collapse and recruitment. The synergic information of these techniques holds promise to be useful when developing and evaluating new ventilatory strategies in horses.

AB  - Summary Surgical technique plays an important role in preventing ventral midline incisional complications. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical and ultrasonographic outcome of three suture techniques for closure of the linea alba. In this prospective case series (n = 43), horses operated for acute abdominal intestinal disease through a midline incision were randomised in three groups: closure with a conventional continuous technique (Group 1), a small stitches continuous technique (Group 2) and the UX-technique (shoe-lace configuration, Group 3). Age, sex, body weight, type and duration of surgery were recorded and the suture to wound length ratio was calculated. Clinical evaluation of the wound (wound discharge) was performed daily during hospitalisation. At 7 weeks post-operatively the linea alba was evaluated clinically and ultrasonographically. The linea alba width was measured halfway along the length of the incision. One horse in Group 1 had acute incisional dehiscence, but there were no further significant differences between the groups in the short term. Seven weeks post-operatively two horses had complete herniation in Group 1 and one horse had partial herniation in Group 2. In the UX group no herniation occurred. The incidence of herniation was not significantly different between the groups. On ultrasound at 7 weeks the linea alba width was significantly smaller in Group 2 (P = 0.00029) and Group 3 (P = 0.0018) compared with Group 1, even with exclusion of the acute incisional dehiscence and two herniated horses. Limitations were the small group size and relatively low incidence of incisional complications for statistical analysis. It was concluded that the use of small stitches and the UX-technique resulted in a smaller linea alba width compared with the conventional continuous suture technique and might therefore be preferred for closure of the linea alba in equine colic surgery.

AB  - Abstract Appropriate deliberate clinical inertia refers to the art of doing nothing as a positive clinical response. It includes shared decision-making to improve patient care with the use of clinical judgement. We discuss common clinical scenarios where the use of deliberate clinical inertia can occur. The insertion of peripheral intravenous cannulae, investigating patients with suspected renal colic and the investigation of low risk chest pain are all opportunities for the thoughtful clinician to ?stand there? and use effective patient communication to avoid low value tests and procedures. Awareness is key to identifying these opportunities to practice deliberate clinical inertia, as many of the situations may be so much a part of our environment that they are hidden in plain view.

AB  - Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a severe complication after liver transplantation that can result in increased morbidity and mortality. Few data are available regarding risk factors, classification, and treatment of PVT after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Between January 2004 and November 2014, 421 adult-to-adult LDLTs were performed at our institution, and they were included in the analysis. Perioperative characteristics and outcomes from patients with no-PVT (n = 393) were compared with those with de novo PVT (total portal vein thrombosis [t-PVT]; n = 28). Ten patients had early portal vein thrombosis (e-PVT) occurring within 1 month, and 18 patients had late portal vein thrombosis (l-PVT) appearing later than 1 month after LDLT. Analysis of perioperative variables determined that splenectomy was associated with t-PVT (hazard ratio [HR], 3.55; P = 0.01), e-PVT (HR, 4.96; P = 0.04), and l-PVT (HR, 3.84; P = 0.03). In contrast, donor age was only found as a risk factor for l-PVT (HR, 1.05; P = 0.01). Salvage rate for treatment in e-PVT and l-PVT was 100% and 50%, respectively, without having an early event of rethrombosis. Mortality within 30 days did not show a significant difference between groups (no-PVT, 2% versus e-PVT, 10%; P = 0.15). No significant differences were found regarding 1-year (89% versus 92%), 5-year (79% versus 82%), and 10-year (69% versus 79%) graft survival between the t-PVT and no-PVT groups, respectively (P = 0.24). The 1-year (89% versus 96%), 5-year (82% versus 86%), and 10-year (79% versus 83%) patient survival was similar for the patients in the no-PVT and t-PVT groups, respectively (P = 0.70). No cases of graft loss occurred as a direct consequence of PVT. In conclusion, the early diagnosis and management of PVT after LDLT can lead to acceptable early and longterm results without affecting patient and graft survival.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the abdominal and abdominal vascular injury. The presence of a seat belt sign (SBS) on the abdomen is associated with a significant increase in intra-abdominal injuries. In adult populations, the presence of an SBS increases the risk of intra-abdominal injury twofold to eightfold. An SBS may be even more concerning in pediatric patients where rates of intra-abdominal injury can be increased as much as twelvefold. Damage-control surgery (DCS) has been applied to many surgical conditions including nontraumatic abdominal surgery, vascular surgery, and orthopedic surgery. For the trauma patient in extremis with noncompressible abdominal or pelvic hemorrhage, resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) is gaining popularity as an alternative to resuscitative thoracotomy and aortic clamping. Abdominal compartment syndrome can affect many body systems including neurologic, cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and genitourinary.

AB  - Summary In order to provide optimal care for the volleyball athlete, it is first necessary to understand the injury pattern. Ankle sprains account for approximately half of all acute time-loss injuries in volleyball. Risk factors for sport-related injuries may be generally classified as either ?intrinsic? or ?extrinsic?. The most important risk factor that has been identified for ankle sprains is a previous ankle sprain injury. Several intervention strategies have been proposed based on the typical injury mechanisms and risk factors for ankle sprains. One of the prevention strategies is to teach proper movement, take-off, and landing techniques. Patellar tendinopathy or ?jumper's knee? is the most common overuse injury in volleyball. Perhaps the most important element in preventing jumper's knee is to load the tendon appropriately. Knee injuries, and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in particular, occur more frequently among female than among male volleyball players.

AB  - Summary In this article we report 3 horses that developed an extraperitoneal abscess after colic surgery at the incision site. All 3 horses presented with nonspecific clinical signs and extraperitoneal abscess was diagnosed from ultrasound evaluations and cytological examination of abscess aspirates. One horse developed dehiscence of the incision after drainage of the abscess through the incision. In 2 cases a small standing paramedian incision was performed through which the abscess was drained and lavaged; complete resolution of the abscess and healing of the incision was achieved in both cases. Extraperitoneal abscess is a previously unreported incisional complication after colic surgery in horses. Early and careful ultrasonographic examination of the abdominal incision is required for diagnosis in cases with nonspecific clinical signs. A paramedian incision through the rectus abdominis muscle into the abscess cavity permitted adequate drainage and debridement of the abscess in 2 cases.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents various eye diseases of the goat, such as blindness, cyclopia, tumours of the eyelids, and mycoplasma. There is strong evidence that Mycoplasma conjunctivae is a major causal agent of keratoconjunctivitis in the United Kingdom. Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) can cause a mucopurulent conjunctivitis in goats. The cornea of goats is commonly traumatised, often by stalks of hay or straw; overlarge tags on the ears of Angora kids may irritate the eye and the eye will also be damaged when entropion is present. Treatment involves correcting or removing the cause of the trauma and then treating the resultant conjunctivitis or corneal damage. Photosensitisation from whatever cause will affect the head, resulting in swelling of unpigmented skin of the muzzle, drooping ears, and swollen eyelids. Affected animals should be removed from exposure to sunlight and any possible photosensitising substance.
