AB  - Objectives Two large multicenter randomised trials were performed in France to assess whether systematic screening with an artery uteroplacental Doppler (AUD) in low-risk pregnant women followed by the prescription of low-dose aspirin in cases with abnormal results reduced the incidence of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and of preeclampsia. Study design and population The first trial ?Seine Saint-Denis? (SSD) trial included 3317 low-risk pregnant women (multi and primigravidae) in 17 French maternity Hospitals and the second ?Erasme? trial included 1869 primigravidae in 12 centres. In the Doppler group, the AUD was performed between 20 and 24?weeks, and women with abnormal results received 100?mg of aspirin daily until the 35th week. Results In the Doppler group, 232 patients (15.7%) had an abnormal result in the SSD trial and 20% in the ERASME trial. The predictive value of the AUD was comparable to that reported in the studies of low-risk populations, but with a low sensitivity. Finally, IUGR, whether defined by the third or tenth percentile, and preeclampsia did not differ significantly between the treatment groups in both trials. Conclusions There is no proof justifying the recommendation of a systematic AUD in a low-risk population, even if abnormal results are followed by aspirin treatment and increase in prenatal surveillance. Future studies must assess predictive tests that can be performed early in pregnancy and can identify populations at very high risk of preeclampsia and IUGR. Only when all of these conditions are fulfilled can aspirin prove its efficacy.

AB  - Introduction:? Sickle cell ulcers are a frequent dermatologic manifestation of sickle cell disease. They are almost exclusively described in the legs near the malleoli and are often bilateral. Such ulcers in the upper extremities are not described. We report a case of sickle cell ulcer in hand presumably related to arterio-venous fistula in the forearm placed for hemodialysis in a patient with chronic kidney disease. Case:? A 45-year-old African-American man with a history of sickle cell disease, hypertension, and kidney failure treated with hemodialysis presented with a painful wound in his left hand near the base of his thumb, which had been present for 6 weeks prior to presentation. There was no history of trauma. 6 months prior to the development of the ulcer, the patient had an arterio-venous fistula placed in the affected hand. The ulcer did not improve with use of antibiotics. Venous ultrasound of the left upper extremity showed occlusion of the cephalic vein and enlargement of the basilic vein. Subsequently, biopsy of the ulcer showed vascular proliferation with thickening of the vessel and obliteration of the vascular lumen. The blood vessels were plugged with sickled red blood cells, characteristic of sickle cell disease. Histological features of the lesion were indicative of vaso-occlusive disease, suggesting sickle cell ulcer. Patient was treated with surgical débridement and skin grafting after hyperbaric oxygen therapy that only resulted in partial recovery of the lesion. Discussion:? The pathogenesis of sickle cell ulcer is presumed to be related to a vaso-occlusive process, leading to tissue necrosis resulting in skin ulcers. Ulcers can occur spontaneously or with local trauma. Low oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, impaired venous hemodynamics, and low hemoglobin are recognized contributing factors. The arterio-venous fistula causing diversion of arterial blood probably contributed to the development of sickle cell ulcer. Conclusion:? Sickle cell ulcers in the hand, although extremely rare, can occur in sickle cell patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis with arterio-venous fistula. This results from the altered local vascular hemodynamics that predispose to vaso-occlusive conditions, eventually leading to ulceration.

AB  - Spontaneous papillary muscle rupture (PMR) is a rare cardiovascular emergency. We present a 63-year-old male who presents with acute dyspnea who was found to have an anterior PMR, with no evidence of coronary artery disease, infection, or trauma. A review of cases of nonischemic spontaneous PMR published in 2000?2015 identified 11 additional cases of spontaneous PMR. Posterior and anterior papillary muscles involvement was identified in 54.5% and 45.5% of cases, respectively. Rapid identification due to advances in imaging modalities and improved surgical management has led to optimal outcomes in patients with spontaneous PMR.

AB  - Summary Background IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a multi-systemic disorder. IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC) is the biliary manifestation of the disease, often in association with autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP). Hepatic manifestations of IgG4-RD are less well described within the literature. Aim To examine and present an overview of IgG4-RD with a focus on the biliary and hepatic manifestations. Methods An electronic search using Medline was performed. Search items included ?IgG4 multi-system disease, IgG4 associated cholangitis, IgG4 associated liver disease and autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP)?. Results IgG4-RD is characterised by an IgG4-positive lymphoplasmacytic tissue infiltrate, storiform fibrosis and an obliterative phlebitis. The HISORt criteria may be used to establish the diagnosis and incorporate a multi-disciplinary approach involving histology, radiology, serum IgG4 levels and response to steroid therapy. IgG4-SC is the commonest extrapancreatic manifestation of type-1 AIP, while the hepatic manifestations remain poorly defined. Important differential diagnoses include primary sclerosing cholangitis, secondary sclerosing cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic carcinoma. Current treatment regimens remain ill defined although steroid therapy is used first line unless contraindicated. Patients with relapsing disease or multifocal disease should be considered for azathioprine. Available data would also suggest a role for rituximab. Conclusions IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis is a common manifestation of IgG4-related disease which requires a multi-disciplinary approach to establish the diagnosis. Differentiating IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis from other conditions, both benign and malignant, is challenging, but vital. Steroids remain the mainstay of treatment. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of the hepatic manifestations of IgG4-related disease continues to evolve.

AB  - Summary Background Noninvasive imaging tools are needed to screen foal femoropatellar joints to detect subclinical osteochondrosis lesions due to focal failure of endochondral ossification to enhance early management to optimise intrinsic healing events. Recently investigations employing 3T susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (3T SWI MRI) and CT have demonstrated their capacity for early osteochondrosis diagnosis, but these technologies are not practical for field screening. We postulate that ultrasonography is a valuable field tool for the detection of subclinical osteochondrosis lesions. Objectives The goals were to 1) describe the ultrasonographic features of the femoral trochlea of healthy and osteochondrosis-predisposed neonatal foals, 2) validate the capacity of ultrasound to assess cartilage canal vascular archictecture and the ossification front and 3) evaluate field feasibility in a pilot study. Study design Experimental study. Methods Ultrasonographic evaluation of osteochondrosis predisposed (n = 10) and control (n = 6) femoral trochleas was performed ex vivo and compared with site-matched histological sections and 3T SWI MRI. The articular and epiphyseal cartilage thickness, ossification front indentation and cartilage canal vascular archictecture were assessed at each ROI. Femoral trochleae of foals (n = 3) aged ≈ 1, 3 and 6 months were also evaluated with ultrasonography in field. Results Ultrasonographic measurements strongly correlated with the histological measurements. There was no difference in the cartilage thickness or ossification front indentation between control and osteochondrosis-predisposed specimens. The cartilage canal vascular archictecture on ultrasonograms corresponded with the vessel pattern observed on site matched histology and 3T SWI MRI. Main limitations The number of specimens for study was limited and no early osteochondrosis lesions were present within the predilected group, but a field study is now underway. Conclusion Ultrasonographic examination of the femoral trochlea permitted accurate evaluation of cartilage thickness, cartilage canal vascular archictecture and ossification front indentation in young foals and is a promising, practical tool for screening subclinical osteochondrosis and monitoring and managing lesions at important clinical sites.

AB  - Canine pancreatic tumours are rare compared to human medicine and the detection and differentiation of pancreatic neoplasia is challenging with B-mode ultrasonography, which often leads to late clinical diagnosis and poor prognosis. This case report describes the findings of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in four dogs with pancreatic adenocarcinoma or insulinoma. B-mode ultrasonography of the pancreas revealed a hypoechoic nodule in three dogs and heterogenous tissue in one dog. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography was able to differentiate between two tumour types: adenocarcinomas showed hypoechoic and hypovascular lesions, whereas insulinomas showed uniformly hypervascular lesions. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography findings were confirmed by cytology and/or histopathology. The results demonstrated that contrast-enhanced ultrasonography was able to establish different enhancement patterns between exocrine (adenocarcinoma) and endocrine (insulinoma) tumours in dogs.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides a brief overview of some of the equipment needed for the interventional endoscopy (IE) procedures. A C-arm fluoroscopy unit is ideal for most IE procedures. Lithotripsy is performed for stone removal. For larger stone burdens intracorporeal lithotripsy is recommended. This can be done using laser, electrohydraulic, ultrasonic, pneumatic, and/or intracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy. The stents most commonly used in IE cases are either metallic or polyurethane. A subcutaneous ureteral bypass device (SUB) is currently placed with surgical-assistance under fluoroscopic guidance. Setting up an IE suite requires meticulous organization. When setting up for an IE procedure it is important that the operator has all the equipment necessary, the procedure is well thought out, and the room is appropriately organized. The operator should have more than one wire, catheter, needle, balloon, laser fiber, basket, available in the event one breaks, gets contaminated, or becomes difficult to use over time.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study was to determine if balloon injury to the adjacent arterial wall during intracoronary stent deployment influences late in-stent neointimal formation. Stent design and deployment techniques are considered important factors in determining acute and long-term success with intracoronary stenting. Experimental and clinical studies support that the extent of neointimal formation and the probability for restenosis are influenced by the magnitude of arterial trauma induced with stenting. Nineteen 18-mm-long balloon-expandable stainless steel stents (MULTI-LINK Duet) were implanted at a 1:1 stent-to-artery ratio in the coronary arteries of swine with a conventional noncompliant balloon (n = 10) or a novel noncompliant balloon with short tapered shoulders to prevent edge dissection (n = 9). Quantitative coronary angiography and histology were used to evaluate balloon and artery interactions and the chronic vascular responses to the stents. Nineteen stents were implanted in the coronary arteries of seven swines at an inflation pressure of 14 atm using a standard noncompliant (n = 10) or a unique short transitional edge protection (n = 9) balloon. Histologic analysis at 28 days demonstrated balloon-associated barotrauma in 13 of 20 (65%) of adjacent nonstented arterial segments with the conventional balloon and only 3 of 18 (17%) of the adjacent nonstented arterial segments with the short transition edge protection balloon (P = 0.022). In-stent neointimal area and % stenosis correlated with the severity of peristent arterial injury (r = 0.43, P = 0.01). In-stent vessel injury scores were similar for stents with peristent injury (1.0 ± 0.3) versus stents without peristent injury (1.0 ± 0.03, P = 0.73). In-stent neointimal area and % stenosis were greater for stents with peristent injury (2.36 ± 0.74 mm2, 32% ± 9%) as compared to stents without peristent injury (1.39 ± 0.70 mm2, 20% ± 10%, P = 0.01). Arterial wall injury adjacent to a stent after high-pressure deployment contributes to late in-stent neointimal hyperplasia in this model. These experimental data suggest that further study is warranted to refine stent implantation techniques and that modifications of balloon shape or material may be useful to optimize stent deployment and reduce arterial trauma.

AB  - Abstract Preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic cysts benefits from integrating the clinical, radiological, and cytological features. As patient management algorithms evolve to increasingly nonsurgical options, accuracy in distinguishing mucinous from nonmucinous and benign from malignant mucinous cysts is important. This review focuses on pseudocysts, serous cystadenomas, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), and mucinous cystic neoplasms. Patients with pseudocysts almost always present with pancreatitis and are usually medically managed. Radiological studies reveal a unilocular cyst mostly in the pancreatic tail. Cyst fluid is thin, with high amylase but low carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. DNA mutations are absent. Serous cystadenomas are benign and do not require resection. Patients are usually asymptomatic and have microcystic or macrocystic masses anywhere in the pancreas. Cytology is frequently nondiagnostic. CEA and amylase levels are low. DNA analysis may reveal loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 3p if associated with Von Hippel-Lindau disease. Neoplastic mucinous cysts are highly variable in their presentation. Most are resected. Mucinous cystic neoplasms typically arise in the body or tail of the pancreas of middle-aged women and demonstrate a septated cyst without dilatation of the main pancreatic duct. Branch duct IPMNs are more common in the pancreatic head of elderly men. Main duct dilatation correlates with main duct or combined type IPMN. Both types of mucinous cysts produce variable amounts of mucin. Cytologically nonmalignant but atypical epithelial cells, even when scant, are an indication of a high risk for malignancy. High CEA level supports a mucinous cyst, as do KRAS mutation and good quality DNA levels. KRAS mutation and multiple LOH support malignancy.

AB  - Abstract History? Ten dogs weighing 36 (21.4?75)?kg [median (min?max)] and aged 3 (1?9)?years scheduled for orthopedic surgery involving the stifle and structures distal to it. Physical Examination? Patients were classified as ASA I or II based on physical examination and basic hematology and biochemistry. Management? Each dog was managed using combined femoral and sciatic nerve blocks and procedural sedation with an intravenous infusion of propofol (0.07?0.15?mg?kg?1?minute?1) and dexmedetomidine (1??g?kg?1?hour?1). None of the patients required conversion to general anesthesia as a result of response to surgical stimulation. The level of sedation was considered adequate in all patients and was characterized by occasional head lifting, thoracic limb stretching, yawning, lingual movements and swallowing. The eye position ranged from central to partial ventromedial rotation and was accompanied by spontaneous blinking. Intra-operative cardiovascular and ventilatory variables were considered within acceptable limits. Muscle relaxation at the surgical field was adequate and surgical conditions were indistinguishable from those produced by general anesthesia. Intraoperatively, no additional analgesics were considered necessary. The quality of the recoveries was considered excellent in all cases. Follow up? No additional pain relief was required in any of the dogs within the 10?hours following blockade. All dogs ate 5.5 (3.5?12)?hours after recovery. Ambulation occurred at 4 (2?6)?hours. No evidence of esophagitis or aspiration pneumonitis has been reported during a period of 1?year after the procedures in any of the dogs. Conclusion? When combined with femoral and sciatic nerve blocks, procedural sedation has the potential of being an alternative to general anesthesia for orthopedic surgery involving the stifle and structures distal to it in the dog.

AB  - Purpose? To review the experience with laparoscopic splenectomy, to determine it?s efficacy for treating immune thrombocytopaenic purpura (ITP) and to highlight key technical issues with the operation. Methodology? All splenectomies performed between 1992 and 2005 were identified from the Otago Surgical Audit and the clinical notes reviewed, including the laboratory records for follow-up data related to the haematologic cases. Results? There were 289 splenectomies performed over the 13 year period. The indications were trauma (111, 38%), haematologic disease (93, 32%), incidental (40, 14%) splenic malignancy (39, 13%), and other (8, 3%). Of the 68 patients with ITP, 49 (72%) had a lateral laparoscopic splenectomy (LLS) with no conversions, a 5% complication rate and one mortality. Based on platelet counts and the requirement for maintenance steroids there was a complete response in 44 (68%) patients at >6 months, a partial response in 16 (24%) and no response in 5 (8%) patients. A short video presentation will highlight the key steps for the safe and efficient performance of the LLS, including patient and port positioning, the use of ultrasonic dissection, splenic pedicle stapling, and morcellation. The indications for hand-port assisted laparoscopic and open splenectomy will be discussed. Conclusions? The LLS is the preferred approach to splenectomy for all but massive splenomegaly and can be performed safely with careful attention to key technical issues.

AB  - While the macroscopic anatomy of the urinary bladder and the kidneys is well known, the ultrasound anatomy of these organs still remains difficult for physicians. The objective was to develop a multimedia computer-based program that helps to reduce the time necessary for learning ultrasonography in dogs and cats. Therefore, the program contains many ultrasound films and images, which are clearly marked. Additionally, colourful diagrams explain the ultrasound examination. Although the urinary bladder is comparatively easy to scan the surrounding structures are often confusing. Many of these structures such as the neighbouring fat are not especially mentioned in macroscopic anatomy. The program clearly demonstrates the advantages of the ultrasound method. For example, the physiological urinary jet into the urinary bladder is compared to urinary jet after application of a diuretic agent (furosemide). The ultrasound anatomy of the kidneys and the related structures are described in detail and illustrated by anatomic preparations and sketches. The comprehensive visual and audio representation of the Doppler ultrasonography of renal vessels is intended as an advanced training for already experienced physicians. The structure of the program is designed with regard to didactic and ergonomic aspects. The user can go through the program step by step or move freely using a navigation bar, visual links (viewer) or one of the various links. Nevertheless, all pages are clearly marked to keep track. The structure of the program is similar in all sections, starting with the anatomical topography and the patient preparation. After a detailed description of the scanning procedure the resulting ultrasound images are demonstrated. The last part includes different techniques of Doppler ultrasonography. The self-explaining multimedia structure of the computer-based program enables an autodidactic training of the ultrasound b-mode and the Doppler ultrasonography of the urinary tract and the kidneys for physicians with little experience as well as for advanced investigators.

AB  - A 10-year-old, entire, male, mixed-breed dog was presented for severe haematuria and stranguria. Ultrasound revealed a large intraluminal urinary bladder blood clot and a prostatic space-occupying lesion. Invasion of the lesion into the prostatic urethra was detected ultrasonographically during compression of the urinary bladder. Post-mortem examination revealed primary prostatic haemangiosarcoma infiltrating the urethra. Haemangiosarcoma should be considered as a rare cause of prostatic mass lesions, haematuria or lower urinary tract signs in dogs.
