AB  - A 10-year-old, entire, male, mixed-breed dog was presented for severe haematuria and stranguria. Ultrasound revealed a large intraluminal urinary bladder blood clot and a prostatic space-occupying lesion. Invasion of the lesion into the prostatic urethra was detected ultrasonographically during compression of the urinary bladder. Post-mortem examination revealed primary prostatic haemangiosarcoma infiltrating the urethra. Haemangiosarcoma should be considered as a rare cause of prostatic mass lesions, haematuria or lower urinary tract signs in dogs.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? To identify strengths and weaknesses in current studies with a view to carrying out a major multi-center study in Australia. Methods:? The literature was reviewed using standard Medline and Ovid methods. Bibliography of well known key recent papers were used to identify further papers. Results:? Studies evaluating persistent pain after breast cancer surgery have been small and few were prospective controlled studies with adequate power. Like Jung et?al[1] we found that the literature was inconsistent in defining chronic pain and differentiating the breast cancer surgery pain syndromes. Marked variations in prior studies are due to differences in: study size (n?=?22 to 282 patients), methodology, diagnostic criteria, pain assessment instruments, and distribution of demographic and clinical characteristics in the samples studied. Unfortunately the largest study to date, the ALMANAC Trial (n?=?1031) which compared sentinel node biopsy vs ?standard axillary dissection? evaluated arm and shoulder function and quality of life, but not pain[2]. From the current literature, it appears that neuropathic breast and arm pain are most common. Widely varying prevalence estimates of different neuropathic pain syndromes have been reported: phantom breast pain (3?44%); intercostobrachial neuralgia (ICBN) (16?39%); ICBN in breast conserving surgery (14?61%); and ?neuroma pain? (23?49%). The most established risk factors for surgically related neuropathic pain syndromes are intraoperative nerve trauma, severe acute postoperative pain, and high use of postoperative analgesics[1]. Psychosocial distress is reported to be a risk factor and a consequence of chronic pain[1]. Conclusions:? Well-designed large multi-center studies are required to identify prevalences of various pain types, associated risk factors and treatment success for pain after breast cancer surgery. Such a study is in progress through the collaboration of our group with the Sentinel Node vs Axillary Clearance (SNAC) Study of 1000 women following breast surgery, conducted by the Royal Australian College of Surgeons (RACS).

AB  - Summary Outcomes following solid organ transplantation continue to improve with advances in immunology and critical care as such recipients are coming into contact with a broader range of healthcare providers, particularly intensivists. Knowledge of the pathophysiology and cellular biology of solid organ transplants is therefore necessary for any critical-care practitioner. This knowledge should include the immunology of rejection, mechanism of action of immunosuppressive medications and their relative merits and side effect profiles. This chapter also explores the common complications seen after solid organ transplants, their pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. Lastly, the immunologic changes associated with transplantation result in a unique set of infectious complications. The common organism, infections and antimicrobials encountered in the post-transplant setting are also described here.

AB  - BackgroundSampling the dermal interstitial fluid (ISF) allows the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dermatological drugs to be studied directly at their site of action. Dermal open-flow microperfusion (dOFM) is a recently developed technique that can provide minimally invasive, continuous, membrane-free (thus unfiltered) access to the dermal ISF. Herein, we evaluate the clinical applicability and reliability of novel wearable dOFM devices in a clinical setting. Methods Physicians inserted 141 membrane-free dOFM probes into the dermis of 17 healthy and psoriatic volunteers and sampled dermal ISF for 25 h by using wearable push-pull pumps. The tolerability, applicability, reproducibility, and reliability of multiple insertions and 25 h continuous sampling was assessed by pain scoring, physician feedback, ultrasound probe depth measurements, and 25 h-drift and variability of the sodium relative recovery. Results Insertion pain was moderate and decreased with each additional probe. Probe insertion was precise, although slightly deeper in lesional skin. The wearable push-pull pump enabled uninterrupted ISF sampling over 25 h with low variability. The relative recovery was drift-free and highly reproducible. Conclusion dOFM sampling devices are tolerable and reliable for prolonged continuous dermal sampling in a multiprobe clinical setting. These devices should enable the study of a wide range of drugs and their biomarkers in the skin.

AB  - An eight-year-old mixed-breed dog was presented with progressive paraparesis. Neurological examination revealed a painful diffuse lesion between spinal cord segments T3 and L3. Magnetic resonance images displayed multi-focal contrast enhancing spinal cord and meningeal lesions. Cytology of these lesions revealed a malignant tumour prompting euthanasia of the dog. Histopathology confirmed the cytological diagnosis and a final diagnosis of a glioblastoma multiforme was made based on immunohistochemistry.

AB  - Abstract In the first case, the AA and glucose were infused through a perinatal port system into the umbilical vein at 30 weeks' gestation due to severe IUGR. The patient received daily hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO, 100% O2) with 1.4 atmospheres absolute for 50 min for 7 days. At 31+4 weeks' gestation, the patient gave birth spontaneously to a newborn weighing 1378 g, pH 7.33, APGAR score 4/6/intubation. In follow-up examinations at 5 years of age, the boy was doing well without any neurological disturbance or developmental delay. In the second case, the patient presented at 25/5 weeks' gestation suffering from severe IUGR received HBO and maternal AA infusions. The cardiotocography was monitored continuously during HBO treatment. The short-time variations improved during HBO from 2.9 to 9 msec. The patient developed pathologic CTG and uterine contractions 1 day later and gave birth to a hypotrophic newborn weighing 420 g. After initial adequate stabilization, the extremely preterm newborn unfortunately died 6 days later. Fetal nutrition combined with HBO is technically possible and may allow the prolongation of the pregnancy. Fetal-specific amino-acid composition would facilitate the treatment options of IUGR fetuses and extremely preterm newborn.

AB  - Abstract Background Obesity is common in the equine population and it has been associated with increased surgical morbidity and mortality in humans. The effect of increased body mass index (BMI) on the incidence of surgical site infections has not been investigated in horses. Objectives To determine whether horses with increased body fat, as estimated by BMI, are more likely to develop post-operative complications, particularly incisional complications, following emergency ventral midline celiotomy. Study design Retrospective, multi-institutional clinical study. Methods Medical records of horses >2 years old presenting with colic that underwent ventral midline celiotomy between January 2010 and September 2018 with follow-up of a minimum of 30 post-operative days were reviewed. Extracted data included signalment, operative details and outcome. BMI was calculated by dividing the patient's weight (kg) by the withers height squared (m2). Results In all, 287 horses fit inclusion criteria. Incisional complication prevalence was 23.7%. Horses with incisional complications had a higher BMI (median 203.6 kg/m2, IQR = 191.5-217.4) compared with those without (median 199.1 kg/m2, IQR = 184.7-210.2) (P = .03). Multi-variable analysis of the effects of age, sex, breed and presence of metabolic disease on the association between BMI and risk of incisional complications, identified a tendency towards increased risk with a higher BMI, but statistical significance decreased to P = .07. Breed had an association with BMI (P < .01), but not with incisional complication risk. Main limitations BMI as an estimate of body fat has limitations. Retrospective studies with reliance on owners reporting data and complete medical records is imperfect. When the data were subjected to multi-variable analysis, the trend towards an increased incidence of incisional complications in horses with higher BMI persisted but it was not statistically significant. Conclusion Higher BMI may increase the risk for the development of incisional complications in horses following emergency ventral midline celiotomy.

AB  - Summary Intestinal ischemia occurs when perfusion to the bowel is inadequate to meet metabolic demands. In acute mesenteric ischemia, all or part of the small bowel is affected. Acute mesenteric ischemia is a clinical emergency with a mortality rate of over 60%; a high index of suspicion is required for early detection before bowel necrosis occurs. In contrast, the more common syndrome of ischemic colitis often has a milder clinical course characterized by transient bloody diarrhea and mild lower abdominal pain. Chronic mesenteric ischemia, also called intestinal angina, is relatively rare and is characterized by abdominal pain following meals and weight loss. It can develop into an emergency if bowel viability is compromised by further deterioration in the blood supply. Multidetector CT angiography is now commonly performed as the initial non-invasive test for acute and chronic mesenteric ischemia. Colonoscopy is often performed to diagnose ischemic colitis.

AB  - Caesarean scar pregnancy is one of the rarest forms of ectopic pregnancy. Little is known about its incidence and natural history. With increasing incidence of caesarean section worldwide, more and more cases are diagnosed and reported. Transvaginal ultrasound and colour flow Doppler provides a high diagnostic accuracy with very few false positives. A delay in diagnosis and/or treatment can lead to uterine rupture, major haemorrhage, hysterectomy and serious maternal morbidity. Early diagnosis can offer treatment options of avoiding uterine rupture and haemorrhage, thus preserving the uterus and future fertility. Management plan should be individually tailored. Available data suggest that termination of pregnancy is the treatment of choice in the first trimester soon after the diagnosis. Expectant treatment has a poor prognosis because of risk of rupture. There are no reliable scientific data on the risk of recurrence of the condition in future pregnancy, role of the interval between the previous caesarean delivery and occurrence of caesarean scar pregnancy, and effect of caesarean wound closure technique on caesarean scar pregnancy. In this article, we aim to find the demography, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, most appropriate methods of diagnosis and management, with their implications in clinical practice for this condition.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To evaluate perfusion index (PI) as a determinant of regional nerve block success following sciatic nerve blockade with bupivacaine in dogs undergoing stifle surgery. Study design Prospective clinical trial. Animals Ten adult dogs, aged 5.6 ± 2.6 years and weighing 36.9 ± 16.8 kg, undergoing a tibial plateau leveling osteotomy. Methods Dogs were premedicated with acepromazine (0.03 mg kg?1) and hydromorphone (0.1 mg kg?1) intramuscularly, and anesthetized with propofol (up to 4 mg kg?1) intravenously and isoflurane in oxygen. An ultrasound-guided femoral and sciatic (F+S) nerve block was performed on the surgical limb with bupivacaine (0.75%), 0.2 mL kg?1 at the femoral site and 0.3 mL kg?1 at the sciatic site, with a maximum volume of 10 mL per site. Physiological variables were recorded every 5 minutes throughout anesthesia. A pulse co-oximeter probe was placed between the third and fourth digits of both pelvic limbs, and the PI was recorded 5 minutes before infiltration with bupivacaine, immediately afterwards, and every 5 minutes for 30 minutes. Motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) of the sciatic nerve was performed on the surgical limb 5 minutes before and 20 minutes after bupivacaine administration to confirm nerve block. Results The PI of the surgical limb was significantly greater than the contralateral pelvic limb at 10 minutes (p = 0.03) and 15 minutes (p < 0.01) after F+S nerve blockade. The MNCV performed after sciatic nerve blockade revealed a functional motor blockade for all dogs. There were no significant changes in physiological variables. Conclusions and clinical relevance The PI provided a reliable indication of successful sciatic nerve blockade in the clinical patients in this study. No increase in the PI by 15 minutes after bupivacaine administration around the sciatic nerve could indicate partial or total failure of anesthetic blockade.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: The anterolateral thigh flap is an increasingly popular reconstructive option despite uncertainty in its perforator anatomy. Perforators are not always present, vary in size and intramuscular course, and have variable cutaneous courses and supply. As such, preoperative imaging has become favored. Methods: The current study describes the preliminary use of two new modalities for preoperative imaging: computed tomography (CT) Angiography and CT-guided stereotaxy. These have been utilized in the preoperative imaging of two patients undergoing ALT flap reconstruction. Each patient underwent each of these techniques combined with Doppler ultrasound, the previous standard modality. The size, location, and course of perforators were explored and compared with operative findings. Results: Both techniques are technically feasible, highly accurate, and provide more information to the surgeon than ultrasound. Conclusion: CT Angiography and CT-guided stereotaxy are useful adjuncts to Doppler ultrasound for imaging perforators prior to ALT flaps. A larger study is suggested to quantify the accuracy of these techniques. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Microsurgery, 2008.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Decreased efficacy of veterinary antimicrobials and increased prevalence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) is of concern, but little is known of antimicrobial resistance encompassing the New Zealand (NZ) equine population. Recent concerns have arisen over the emergence of multi-resistant bacteria [1], especially on NZ stud farms where antibiotics are frequently used for respiratory disease without veterinary input [2]. Objectives To describe bacterial culture and antimicrobial sensitivity results from respiratory samples submitted of young horses (4 weeks to 3 years old). Study design Retrospective study of clinical pathology records. Methods A database search for isolates and sensitivity of respiratory samples from young horses (April 2004?July 2014) was conducted. The results of in vitro sensitivity testing by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion were tabulated for major bacterial species isolated. Multiple correspondence analysis was used to describe clustering of multi-drug resistance (MDR) and selected demographic variables. Results 237/289 eligible respiratory samples had at least one aerobic bacterial isolate. Most of the 774 bacterial isolates were Gram-positive (68%). Streptococcus species were the most common genus isolated (40% of isolates). Sensitivity of Streptococcus spp. to penicillin, gentamicin and ceftiofur was >85%, but only 53% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxone. Gram-negative sensitivity to ceftiofur, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxone was <75%. MDR was found for 16% of isolates and in 39% of horses. Conclusions Penicillin is an appropriate first-line antimicrobial for use in most NZ young horses with suspected bacterial respiratory infection. However, based on findings of MDR, submission of samples for culture and monitoring of sensitivity should be used to inform antimicrobial selection. Ethical animal research:?Not applicable. Sources of funding:?Massey University McGeorge Fund; New Zealand Equine Research Foundation. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is not rare, which would affect the patient?s prognosis. Objectives To examine the prevalence, risk factors and clinical characteristics of AECOPD patients with VTE. Methods We performed this multi-center, prospective, observational study that involved 16 hospitals in China. Patients admitted to hospital due to AECOPD were consecutively enrolled. Baseline characteristics, VTE risk factors, symptoms, signs and auxiliary examination results were collected. Lower limb venous ultrasound and computed tomography pulmonary angiography were examined. Results Between June 2009 and October 2010, a total of 1144 AECOPD patients (the average age 72.0 ± 9.1 years, 761 males) were enrolled in this study. Seventy-eight (6.8%) were diagnosed with VTE, including 24 PE, 64 DVT, 10 combined PE and DVT. VTE patients were older than non-VTE patients. History of venous thromboembolism and lower extremity varicose vein, and presence of longer immobility (≥3 days), lower limbs problems of swelling, pain and walking difficulties, diuretics use, fever, syncope, higher d-dimer and lower hemoglobin were more common in VTE patients than in non-VTE patients. After adjusting the covariates, venous thrombosis history, prolonged immobility (≥3 days), lower limb pain before hospitalization, higher d-dimer independently associated with VTE development. Regular glucocorticoid use was not associated with increased risk of VTE in this set of patients. Conclusion VTE is relatively common among hospitalized AECOPD patients. Conventional prophylactic anticoagulant therapy may be considered for those hospitalized AECOPD patients with risk factors.

AB  - A ventricular septal defect is the most common congenital cardiac abnormality encountered in infants and children. Many of them survive through adulthood before diagnosis. Two-thirds of the cases involve the membranous part of the septum. In the absence of an interventricular shunt or concomitant cardiac surgery, guidelines for surgical intervention or resection of isolated aneurysms of the membranous septum are not well established. In this report, we discuss a multi?imaging modality approach for the diagnosis and assessment of membranous ventricular septal aneurysms and review the experts' consensuses for follow-up and treatment strategies.

Design Postal survey of members of the British Gynaecological Cancer Society (BGCS) and retrospective case review. Results BGCS consultants used ultrasound scanning (70%) and serum CA-125 estimations (53%) prior to adnexal mass surgery. The membership felt that adnexal masses with solid elements, diameter greater than 8 cm, multi-ocular or bilateral cysts or increased blood flow on Doppler scanning should not be operated on by minimal access surgery. A positive family history was also considered to be a contraindication. A total of 29 cases of ovarian cancer were identified on whom MAS had been performed. The incidence of cases was 4.1% of referrals to a tertiary referral centre (the Royal Marsden Hospital). The median age of patients was 37 years (range 20 to 68 years) and 13 had Stage I cancers. The mean delay between diagnosis and staging was 6.5 weeks. Conclusion Guidelines on the use of minimal access surgery in the management of adnexal masses need to be agreed. Women who have an ovarian cancer diagnosed whilst having minimal access surgery should have an accepted staging procedure. We do not recommend the routine use of minimal access surgery for the treatment of ovarian cancer outside a trial.

AB  - Summary.? Introduction: Although the advent of multi-detector row computed tomography (CT) has enabled better visualization of subsegmental pulmonary (SSP) arteries, SSP embolism is of uncertain clinical significance. We aimed at answering the following questions: Is spiral CT an accurate method to detect SSP embolism? How are subsegmental perfusion defects managed in outcome studies including spiral CT? What are the main characteristics and outcomes of patients in whom CT detects isolated subsegmental defects? Methods: We performed a Medline search on July 1, 2004, using the keywords ?pulmonary embolism? and ?computed tomography?. We limited our search to English language prospective studies comparing CT to pulmonary angiography, and to prospective outcome studies including CT in a diagnostic strategy, with at least a 3-month follow-up. Results: Fourteen studies comparing CT to pulmonary angiography, and five prospective management studies using CT were retrieved. The sensitivity of single-detector CT for detecting subsegmental defects compared with pulmonary angiography was low (25%). The proportion of isolated SSP images was significantly higher in management studies using multi-detector CT (17 of 770 scans, 2.2%) compared with those using single-detector CT (22 of 2232, 1.0%; P?=?0.01). No straightforward attitude regarding anticoagulation therapy for isolated subsegmental defects emerged from the available literature. Finally, important clinical differences were found between patients having subsegmental and segmental or more proximal defects. Conclusions: These findings underline the uncertainty regarding the clinical significance of SSP embolism, and the management of patients with such findings.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to review and characterise the clinical presentation of young boxer dogs with chronic kidney disease referred to the authors? institutions. Methods: Records were collected retrospectively from 37 boxer dogs, less than five years of age, which had presented with azotaemia, inappropriately low urine concentrating ability, and ultrasound or radiographic evidence of abnormal kidneys. Results: Clinicopathological findings included azotaemia, hyperphosphataemia, anaemia, isosthenuria and proteinuria. Ultrasonographic findings included hyperechoic renal cortices, loss of corticomedullary junction definition, dilated pelves and irregularly shaped small kidneys. Renal histopathological findings included pericapsular and interstitial fibrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, dilated tubules, sclerotic glomeruli and dystrophic calcification. Survival time of the dogs varied from zero to over five years after diagnosis. Clinical Significance: This paper documents features of the presentation and progression of juvenile nephropathy in boxer dogs. While juvenile nephropathy has been reported in individual cases of boxer dogs previously, this is the first reported case series.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The Myanmar Ministry of Health has formed a partnership with Australasian professional colleges and international medical specialists to deliver a comprehensive programme for emergency care training and development. We describe this programme, emphasising the training of the first emergency specialists for Myanmar. Methods Eighteen junior specialists (EM18) joined a new postgraduate diploma in emergency medicine (Dip EM) through the University of Medicine (1) (UM1), Yangon. Diploma content included an introductory course, clinical rotations, 2 months in the emergency receiving centre (ERC) of the Yangon General Hospital (YGH) supervised by a volunteer Australasian emergency physician (FACEM), several short courses and an educational visit to Hong Kong. Curriculum and assessments comprising written and oral exams were devised and delivered by volunteer FACEMs and Hong Kong specialists. Results All EM18 completed the 18 month programme and passed the final assessments to graduate in February 2014. Course strengths included the supervised clinical rotation to the ERC and short course teaching on emergency medical, surgical, trauma, paediatric and disaster topics. The educational visit to Hong Kong enabled the EM18 to visualise more advanced EM systems that could be adapted to the Myanmar context. The participating international clinicians provided expert strategic advice on ED design, staffing, equipment, nursing and pre-hospital systems to leaders within universities, hospitals and the Ministry of Health. Conclusion The first Myanmar postgraduate diploma in EM provides an example of collaborative and responsive clinical health capacity building in a context of very limited resources.

AB  - Summary Monitoring the effectiveness of treatment is an essential part of the overall management of horses affected by a wide variety of abdominal conditions. Careful monitoring of gastrointestinal function is important so that the response to therapy can be assessed, and any derangements or deteriorations of gastrointestinal function can be identified and supportive therapy instituted rapidly. However, the critically ill patient may develop abnormalities and dysfunction of many organ systems in addition to the system affected by the primary disease. The result can be multi-organ dysfunction, and ultimately multi-organ failure, which is invariably fatal. It is important, therefore, that monitoring allows assessment of the function of all of the major organ systems, and not just gastrointestinal function. This monitoring includes repeated physical examinations and pain assessment, monitoring of temperature and pulse and respiratory rates, and collection of clinical pathological data. Accurate medical records are essential to monitor trends in an animal's response to treatment.
