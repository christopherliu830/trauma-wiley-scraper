AB  - Cognitive dysfunction remains a significant complication after cardiopulmonary bypass, despite continuous improvement in the overall outcome in open-heart surgery. Embolization of the atheromatous material, most notably during removal of the aortic clamp, is a major cause. Strategies have been developed to minimize cerebral embolization. Modified surgical techniques include the use of hypothermic circulatory arrest, venting of the left ventricle, minimizing aortic manipulation, and the use of epiaortic ultrasound to locate and avoid trauma to the aortic atheromatous plaque. Use of an intra-aortic filter has been shown recently to reduce intraoperative cerebral embolic events and improve postoperative neurocognitive outcomes. Off-pump coronary artery bypass technique has also been claimed to have lower neurological complications, which is probably attributable to the avoidance of aortic cannulation and cardiopulmonary bypass. Its role on cerebral protection is, however, debatable. Chinese Abstract Chinese Abstract

AB  - OBJECTIVE To report the clinical presentation, surgical treatment and outcomes of dogs with retrobulbar abscesses refractory to intra-oral lancing and antibiotics. METHODS Medical records from January 2006 through September 2014 were reviewed and dogs with retrobulbar abscesses failing treatment with antibiotics and intra-oral lancing were included. Clinicopathologic, imaging and surgical details were extracted from the medical records. Referring veterinarians and owners were interviewed via telephone for follow-up data. RESULTS A total of six dogs were included in the study. The most common clinical signs were pain upon opening of the mouth, exophthalmos and prolapsed nictitans. Computed tomography was performed in five dogs, ultrasound in four and magnetic resonance imaging in one. Imaging identified an abscess in all dogs, with a suspected foreign body in four dogs. Surgical approach was a modified lateral orbitotomy in five dogs. No foreign body was identified during surgery in all dog. All dogs surviving to discharge did not have recurrence of clinical signs (follow-up time range: 27 to 95 months). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Dogs with retrobulbar abscesses refractory to standard therapy can experience long-term resolution of clinical signs with surgical treatment, most commonly via a modified lateral orbitotomy.

AB  - Objective To evaluate association between ultrasonographic urine echogenicity and sediment examination in dogs and cats. Materials and Methods Dogs and cats undergoing ultrasound-guided cystocentesis at a multidisciplinary referral hospital. Ultrasonographic images were stored and reviewed by a single, blinded, board-certified radiologist. Urine appearance was described as ?echoic? or ?anechoic?. Urine sediment was examined for bacteriuria, pyuria, haematuria, crystalluria and urine-specific gravity and then classified as ?active? or ?inactive.? Results Of the 194 cases included in this study, urine was echoic in 52 and anechoic in 142. Sediment was active in 52 and inactive in 142 samples. Sensitivity and specificity of echoic urine for active sediment were 40% (95% CI: 27 to 55%) and 78% (95% CI: 70 to 85%), respectively. Positive predictive value and negative predictive value of echoic urine for active sediment were 40% (CI 30 to 52%) and 78% (CI 74 to 82%), respectively. If urine-specific gravity was <1.015 urine was always described ultrasonographically as anechoic. Clinical Significance Association between sediment analysis and ultrasonographic appearance of urine is poor. Echoic urine had low positive predictive value for active sediment in this study, suggesting that echoic urine alone should not prompt urinary investigations in the absence of other clinical suspicion. Despite a negative predictive value of 78%, urinalysis is still indicated for anechoic urine, especially if urine specific gravity is low.

AB  - BACKGROUND Implications from the pragmatic, randomize, optimal platelet and plasma ratios (PROPPR) trial are critical for remote damage control resuscitation (DCR). Utilizing DCR principals in remote settings can combat early mortality from hemorrhage. Identifying the appropriate transfusion strategy is mandatory prior to adopting prehospital hemostatic resuscitation strategies. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The PROPPR study was examined in relation to the following questions: 1) Why is it important to have blood products in the prehospital setting?; 2) Which products should be investigated for prehospital hemostatic resuscitation?; 3) What is the appropriate ratio of blood product transfusion?; and 4) What are the appropriate indications for hemostatic resuscitation? RESULTS PROPPR demonstrates that early and balanced blood product transfusion ratios reduced mortality in all patients at 3 hours and death from exsanguination at 24 hours (p?=?0.03). The median time to death from exsanguination was 2.3 hours, highlighting the need for point-of-injury DCR capabilities. A 1:1:1 transfusion ratio of plasma:platelets:packed red blood cells increased the percentage of patients achieving anatomic hemostasis (p?=?0.006). PROPPR used the assessment of blood consumption score to identify patients likely to require ongoing hemostatic resuscitation. The critical administration threshold predicted patient mortality and identified patients likely to require ongoing hemostatic resuscitation. CONCLUSION A balanced resuscitation strategy demonstrates an early survival benefit, decreased death from exsanguination at 24 hours and a greater likelihood of achieving hemostasis in critically injured patients receiving a 1:1:1 ratio of plasma:platelets:PRBCs. This finding highlights the need to import DCR principals to remote locations.

AB  - Mycobacterium thermoresistibile was isolated in pure culture from ultrasound-guided pulmonary aspirates taken from a young cat with severe, chronic, pyogranulomatous pneumonia. Thoracic radiography and ultrasonography before therapy demonstrated severe diffuse alveolar disease. Twelve months combination therapy with doxycycline, rifampicin and clarithromycin resolved the infection. Thoracic radiographs taken at the completion of therapy showed multifocal pulmonary mineralisation. M thermoresistibile has been infrequently reported as a human or animal pathogen. This is the first reported pulmonary infection by M thermoresistibile in a cat and documents the successful treatment of the organism in a feline patient.

AB  - The brain veins of infants are in a complex phase of remodelling in the perinatal period. Magnetic resonance venography and susceptibility-weighted imaging, together with high-resolution Doppler ultrasound, have provided new tools to aid study of venous developmental anatomy and disease. This review aims to provide a comprehensive background of vein development and perinatal venous lesions in preterm and term-born infants, and to encourage further research in both the fetus and the newborn infant, with the aim of preventing or mitigating parenchymal injury related to diseases involving veins.

AB  - Abstract The aim of the study was an objective in vivo assessment of skin properties after reconstruction with two artificial dermal substitutes, Integra? and Hyalomatrix?. Twenty-seven patients underwent reconstruction of 36 skin-loss sites with full-thickness skin graft, split-thickness skin graft, Hyalomatrix? bioengineered skin substitute and sequential split-thickness skin graft and Integra? bioengineered skin substitute and sequential split-thickness skin graft. Objective assessments were carried out using three instrumental devices: Multi Probe Adapter System MPA; 22?MHz ultrasound skin scan; and Primos Pico for a three-dimensional (3D) skin scan. The skin parameters under study in our sample were: corneometry, transepidermal water loss, elastometry, colorimetry, skin thickness and 3D skin surface pattern. A skin reconstruction with Hyalomatrix seemed to most closely approach the hydration, transepidermal water loss and skin surface 3D pattern of normal skin. A skin reconstruction with Integra seemed to demonstrate the best skin colour feature and elastic properties. Although no statistically significant differences were observed, the descriptive analysis of the outcomes might suggest a better cell regulation, regenerated extracellular matrix and neoangiogenesis with the use of Hyalomatrix, and the formation of a more elastic regenerated dermis, with overall better physical, mechanical and optical properties, with the use of Integra. ? 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Nine dogs with panniculitis due to rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) were examined over 17 years. Dogs were two to 15 years; five were male, four were female. All were obese or in good condition. Antecedent injury, typically a dog bite or vehicular trauma, could be identified in some patients, while one bitch had hyperadrenocorticism. Infections involved different locations, although the cervicothoracic region, dorsum or flank were most often affected. Patients were systemically well, apart from one dog with pyrexia and two with pain or lameness. Cytology demonstrated pyogranulomatous inflammation, but in only one case was it possible to see acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in smears. Histology demonstrated chronic active pyogranulomatous panniculitis and dermatitis; AFB could be detected in only four specimens. Culture of aspirates or resected tissues demonstrated RGM in all cases, comprising six Mycobacterium smegmatis group and three Mycobacterium fortuitum group isolates. Resection of infected tissues, perioperative injectable antimicrobials and long courses of oral antimicrobials chosen according to susceptibility data generally effected a cure, although some cases recurred.

AB  - Abstract Alterations of blood rheology (hemorheology) are important for the early diagnosis, prognosis, and prevention of many diseases, including myocardial infarction, stroke, sickle cell anemia, thromboembolism, trauma, inflammation, and malignancy. However, real-time in vivo assessment of multiple hemorheological parameters over long periods of time has not been reported. Here, we review the capabilities of label-free photoacoustic (PA) and photothermal (PT) flow cytometry for dynamic monitoring of hemorhelogical parameters in vivo which we refer to as photoacoustic and photothermal blood rheology. Using phenomenological models, we analyze correlations between both PT and PA signal characteristics in the dynamic modes and following determinants of blood rheology: red blood cell (RBC) aggregation, deformability, shape (e.g., as in sickle cells), intracellular hemoglobin distribution, individual cell velocity, hematocrit, and likely shear rate. We present ex vivo and in vivo experimental verifications involving high-speed PT imaging of RBCs, identification of sickle cells in a mouse model of human sickle cell disease and in vivo monitoring of complex hemorheological changes (e.g., RBC deformability, hematocrit and RBC aggregation). The multi-parameter platform that integrates PT, PA, and conventional optical techniques has potential for translation to clinical applications using safe, portable, laser-based medical devices for point-of-care screening of disease progression and therapy efficiency. ? 2011 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry

AB  - The common peroneal nerve arises from the sciatic nerve and is subject to a variety of abnormalities. Although diagnosis is often is based on the clinical findings and electrodiagnostic tests, high-resolution sonography has an increasing role in determining the type and location of common peroneal nerve abnormalities and other peripheral nerve disorders. This article reviews the normal sonographic appearance of the common peroneal nerve and the findings in 21 patients with foot drop related to common peroneal neuropathy.

AB  - Summary Our study group recently evaluated an ED95 local anaesthetic volume of 0.11?ml.mm?2 cross-sectional nerve area for the ulnar nerve. This prospective, randomised, double-blind crossover study investigated whether this volume is sufficient for brachial plexus blocks at the axillary level. Ten volunteers received an ultrasonographic guided axillary brachial plexus block either with 0.11 (?low? volume) or 0.4?(?high? volume)?ml.mm?2 cross-sectional nerve area with mepivacaine 1%. The mean (SD) volume was in the low volume group 4.0 (1.0) and 14.8?(3.8)?ml in the high volume group. The success rate for the individual nerve blocks was 27 out of 30 in the low volume group (90%) and 30 out of 30 in the high volume group (100%), resulting in 8 out of 10 (80%) vs 10 out of 10 (100%) complete blocks in the low vs the high volume groups, respectively (NS). The mean (SD) sensory onset time was 25.0?(14.8)?min in the low volume group and 15.8?(6.8)?min in the high volume group (p?<?0.01). The mean (SD) duration of sensory block was 125?(38)?min in the low volume group and 152?(70)?min in the high volume group (NS). This study confirms our previous published ED95 volume for mepivacaine 1% to block peripheral nerves. The volume of local anaesthetic has some influence on the sensory onset time.

AB  - A 12-month-old beagle presented for anorexia, pyrexia and vomiting. The dog had been treated intermittently with antibiotics and corticosteroids for inappetence and lethargy since five months of age. Previous laboratory abnormalities included macrocytosis and neutropenia. At presentation, the dog was lethargic, febrile and thin. Laboratory examination findings included anaemia, a left shift, thrombocytopenia, hypoglycaemia and hyperbilirubinaemia. Multiple, small, hypoechoic, round hepatic lesions were observed on abdominal ultrasound. Cytological examination of hepatic fine needle aspirates revealed a fungal infection and associated pyogranulomatous inflammation. The dog's general condition deteriorated despite supportive measures and treatment with fluconazole, and owners opted for euthanasia before hypocobalaminaemia was identified. Subsequent genomic analysis revealed a CUBN:c.786delC mutation in a homozygous state, confirming hereditary cobalamin malabsorption (Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome). Similar to human infants, dogs with Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome may rarely be presented for infectious diseases, distracting focus from the underlying primary disorder.

Diagnostic ultrasound demonstrated a fluid filled cavernous mass that was not clearly demarcated from the surrounding subcutaneous tissue. Contrast radiography with intralesional injection of contrast medium showed accumulation of the medium in the caverns of the mass and in the saphenous vein. Contrast enhanced computed tomography demonstrated 2 vascular meshes, one deep and one more superficially, closely associated with the mass. Surgical excision of the mass was performed and a vascular hamartoma was diagnosed based on histopathology. The horse showed no signs of recurrence 7 months after surgery.

AB  - Objective To describe the frequency and extent of complications associated with lateral caudal axial pattern flaps used to cover large traumatic or excision skin defects on the dorsum, gluteal, and perineal region in 13 dogs. Study Design Case series. Animals Thirteen client-owned dogs. Methods Medical records from 8 institutions were reviewed for dogs treated with a lateral caudal axial pattern flap, including cases in which the procedure was combined with other reconstructive techniques. The flap length relative to the tail length, location of tail skin incision, size and cause of the defect, and short- and long-term complications were recorded. Results Thirteen dogs were included, 11 with tumors and 2 with traumatic skin loss. The mean estimated length of the flap relative to tail length was 51% (range 33?70%). Four dogs had wound complications. This included 2 dogs with minor postoperative wound complications (mild distal dehiscence) that did not require surgical revision and 2 dogs with major complications that required surgical revision. Two of these 4 dogs had distal flap necrosis, one was revised surgically and one was managed conservatively. In these 2 dogs, the flap length was estimated as 80% and 65% of the tail length, respectively. At 30 days, flaps in all dogs were completely healed. No long-term complications were recorded in any dog. For some dogs, the reconstruction was not obvious, with only the change in hair direction and color noticeable. Conclusion Lateral caudal axial pattern flap is a reconstructive option for gluteal, dorsal, and perineal skin defects in dogs. Distal flap necrosis and dehiscence due to wound infection occurred in 4 dogs that required additional wound care but not always surgical revision.

AB  - Abstract Objective To test whether postnatal psychological distress in parents of babies with congenital malformations is reduced by prenatal diagnosis. Methods A prospective observational longitudinal cohort study was conducted at two Norwegian hospitals. We included 293 parents of babies with congenital malformations (prenatal detection rate: 36.5%) referred for neonatal surgery and 249 parents of healthy babies (comparison group). Parental psychological responses were assessed on three postnatal occasions by psychometric instruments (GHQ-28, STAI-X1, and IES). Results Significantly increased psychological distress (GHQ-28) was reported by parents who received prenatal diagnosis as compared to postnatal diagnosis; acutely 28.9 versus 24.4, P = 0.006 (comparison group: 19.6); at 6 weeks 26.8 versus 21.5, P < 0.001 (comparison group: 17.7); and at 6 months 22.6 versus 18.7, P = 0.015 (comparison group: 16.6). Mothers consistently reported higher levels of distress than fathers. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that prenatal diagnosis and being a mother significantly predicted severity of acute psychological distress. At 6 weeks and 6 months, mortality and associated anomalies were significant independent predictors of psychological distress. Conclusion Controlling for other covariates, we found that prenatal diagnosis of congenital malformations was a significant independent predictor of acute parental psychological distress after birth.

AB  - Abstract Imaging should only be undertaken if it is likely to influence patient management. The dose of ionising radiation to the patient should be considered. Requesting the appropriate imaging method requires an understanding of the pathological process. Plain x-ray should still generally be the first imaging technique; exceptions include some forms of superficial tendinopathy, in which ultrasound may be more appropriate, and situations where radiation exposure is contraindicated, such as in a pregnant patient. The cost of the examination to the patient and the community should also be considered (eg, ultrasound v magnetic resonance imaging).

AB  - Abstract Background? Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play a role in the repair and regeneration of the endothelium and may represent a novel cardiovascular risk factor. South Asian subjects have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease which is not fully explained by known risk factors. This study examined associations of EPCs with atherosclerosis and possible ethnic differences in EPCs. Materials and methods? A population sample of 58 European and South Asian adult men was enriched with the recruitment of an additional 59 European and South Asian men with known coronary disease. The coronary artery calcification score was measured by multi-slice computerized tomography (CT), carotid and femoral intima-media thickness (IMT), and femoral plaques were measured by ultrasound. The subjects were further subdivided into three categories of coronary artery disease on the basis of coronary artery calcification score and clinical history. Total EPCs and non-senescent EPCs (ns-EPCs) were quantified after 5 days cell culture and the number of late outgrowth colonies was measured over a 6-week test period. Circulating CD34+ haematopoietic precursor cells were measured by flow cytometry. Results? Individuals with femoral plaques had reduced total and ns-EPCs. The number of ns-EPCs were reduced in individuals with the most coronary atheroma and were inversely related to the coronary calcification score and femoral IMT. These relationships persisted after multivariate adjustment for other risk factors. The numbers of late outgrowth colonies or circulating CD34+ cells were unrelated to the presence of atherosclerosis. There were no differences in the number of EPCs between European and South Asian subjects. Conclusion? The number of EPCs are reduced in subjects with atherosclerosis independent of other risk factors. Reduction in EPC numbers may be an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis but does not explain ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk.
