AB  - Ultrasound is a promising neural stimulation modality, but an incomplete understanding of its range and mechanism of effect limits its therapeutic application. We investigated the modulation of spontaneous hippocampal spike activity by ultrasound at a lower acoustic intensity and longer time scale than has been previously attempted, hypothesizing that spiking would change conditionally upon the availability of glutamate receptors. Using a 60-channel multielectrode array (MEA), we measured spontaneous spiking across organotypic rat hippocampal slice cultures (N?=?28) for 3?min each before, during, and after stimulation with low-intensity unfocused pulsed or sham ultrasound (spatial-peak pulse average intensity 780??W/cm2) preperfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid, 300??M kynurenic acid (KA), or 0.5??M tetrodotoxin (TTX) at 3?ml/min. Spike rates were normalized and compared across stimulation type and period, subregion, threshold level, and/or perfusion condition using repeated-measures ANOVA and generalized linear mixed models. Normalized 3-min spike counts for large but not midsized, small, or total spikes increased after but not during ultrasound relative to sham stimulation. This result was recapitulated in subregions CA1 and dentate gyrus and replicated in a separate experiment for all spike size groups in slices pretreated with aCSF but not KA or TTX. Increases in normalized 18-sec total, midsized, and large spike counts peaked predominantly 1.5?min following ultrasound stimulation. Our low-intensity ultrasound setup exerted delayed glutamate receptor-dependent, amplitude- and possibly region-specific influences on spontaneous spike rates across the hippocampus, expanding the range of known parameters at which ultrasound may be used for neural activity modulation. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after kidney transplantation is 15-fold increased. Acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) is one of the known risk factors. We performed a small pilot study to assess the role of non-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a tool for intensified screening in renal transplant recipients with ACKD. Renal ultrasound was used to assess the native kidneys of 215 renal transplant recipients. Thirty patients with 54 kidneys, fulfilling the criteria of ACKD, underwent non-enhanced MRI at 1.5T using T2- and T1-weighed as well as diffusion-weighted sequences with a high spatial resolution. Among the 54 kidneys assessed by both methods, three RCCs were identified (6%). Of those, one RCC was detected by both imaging methods (33%), while two RCCs were diagnosed by MRI alone (67%). MRI identified an additional four proteinaceous or hemorrhagic cysts that did not fulfill the criteria for RCC but were classified as suspicious. All of these lesions were stable in size and appearance in follow-up studies. In conclusion, non-enhanced MRI was more sensitive than ultrasound in identifying RCCs and lesions suspicious for RCC and thus appears to be a useful secondary screening tool in patients with ACKD after renal transplantation.

AB  - Abstract Aim To determine the role of levator ani trauma in anal incontinence (AI), whilst controlling for anal sphincter injury. Methods The records of 1273 patients who had attended a tertiary urogynaecology unit between 1st of January to 31st December 2016 were reviewed. AI was assessed using St Mark's score and visual analogue scale (VAS). Levator muscle and anal sphincter trauma were examined by translabial ultrasound using tomographic imaging, with archived data sets investigated blinded against all clinical data. A complete avulsion was diagnosed if at least three central tomographic slices showed an abnormal muscle insertion, rated separately for each side. A significant anal sphincter defect was diagnosed if at least four out of six slices showed a defect of ≥ 30°. Results Avulsion was associated with St Mark's score (P = 0.005) and VAS bother of AI (P = 0.022) both on univariate analysis and when controlling for external anal sphincter (EAS) trauma on translabial imaging, forceps, body mass index (BMI) and age (P = 0.011 and P = 0.04, respectively). AI expressed as a binary variable was significantly associated with avulsion on univariate analysis (P = 0.011), although the association became nonsignificant after controlling for anal sphincter trauma, age, BMI and forceps delivery (P = 0.084). Conclusion In this retrospective observational study, we found a weak association between levator ani avulsion and measures of AI, which largely remained significant when controlling for anal sphincter trauma. However, given the large data set, any clinical effect of levator trauma on AI is likely to be minor.

AB  - Abstract Recent developments in diagnostic imaging have made gynecologists, colorectal surgeons and gastroenterologists realize as never before that they share a common interest in anorectal and pelvic floor dysfunction. While we often may be using different words to describe the same phenomenon (e.g. anismus/vaginismus) or attributing different meanings to the same words (e.g. rectocele), we look after patients with problems that transcend the borders of our respective specialties. Like no other diagnostic modality, imaging helps us understand each other and provides new insights into conditions we all need to learn to investigate better in order to improve clinical management. In this review we attempt to show what modern ultrasound imaging can contribute to the diagnostic work-up of patients with posterior vaginal wall prolapse, obstructed defecation and rectal intussusception/prolapse. In summary, it is evident that translabial/perineal ultrasound can serve as a first-line diagnostic tool in women with such complaints, replacing defecation proctography and MR proctography in a large proportion of female patients. This is advantageous for the women themselves because ultrasound is much better tolerated, as well as for healthcare systems since sonographic imaging is much less expensive. However, there is a substantial need for education, which currently remains unmet. Copyright ? 2012 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Arthrosis of the articular process joints (APJs) in the caudal thoracolumbar region of horses may cause back pain and subsequent reduced performance or lameness. Ultrasound-guided injections of the APJs of the equine back have been described only briefly in the literature. Objectives: To evaluate factors affecting the accuracy of intra-articular injections of the APJs in the caudal thoracolumbar region. Methods: One-hundred-and-fifty-four injections with blue dye were performed on APJs including the T14?L6 region in 12 horses subjected to euthanasia for reasons unrelated to back problems. The backs were subsequently dissected to verify the location of the injectate in relation to the APJs. Results: Twenty-seven percent of the injections were found to be intra-articular and a total of 77% found to be within 2?mm of the joint capsule including the intra-articular deposits. Application of a medial approach and 18 gauge needle were significantly associated with an intra-articular injection or deposition close to the joint capsule. Operator, APJ (location) and back number (chronological) did not significantly affect the accuracy of injection. Conclusions and potential relevance: Injection of the vertebral APJ in the thoracolumbar region using ultrasound guidance is a reliable method, as most of the injections were either in or within 2?mm of the joint. Based on the findings of this cadaver study, the medial approach is expected to be the most accurate in live horses. Further investigations are required to evaluate the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of this method in clinical practice.

AB  - ABSTRACT Maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following trauma exposure during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of affective disorders in children. To investigate the mechanisms by which prenatal trauma and/or maternal PTSD affect brain development and behavior we established a mouse model of prenatal traumatic (PT) experience based on the application of an electric foot shock to C57Bl/6N female mice on the gestational day 12 during their pregnancy. The model is based on a previously validated animal model of PTSD. We found high anxiety levels and poor maternal care along with reduced serum prolactin and increased corticosterone levels in dams following maternal trauma (MT). PT-pups were born smaller and stayed smaller throughout their life. We show increased time and frequency of ultrasonic calls in PT-pups when separated from the mothers on the postnatal day (PND) 9. Cross-fostering experiments reveal lower anxiety levels in PT pups raised by healthy mothers as compared to trauma-naive pups raised by MT-dams. Importantly, the combination of prenatal trauma and being raised by a traumatized mother leads to: (1) the highest corticosterone levels in pups, (2) longest USV-call time and (3) highest anxiety levels in comparison to other experimental groups. Our data indicates a distinct change in maternal care following MT which is possibly associated with trauma-induced decrease in prolactin levels. Furthermore, we show that maternal behavior is crucial for the development of the offspring anxiety and specific aspects in maternal care overwrite to a significant extend the effects of in utero and postnatal environment. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: The post operative response of the large colon wall after a surgically corrected large colon volvulus (LCV) has not been investigated. Objectives: To use transabdominal ultrasound to monitor the post operative change in large colon wall thickness following surgical correction of LCV. Hypothesis: A prolonged period to colon wall involution is correlated with an increased rate of post operative morbidity and mortality. Methods: A prospective clinical study including horses that presented to the North Carolina State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital for colic between September 2006 and March, 2008, had surgically diagnosed and corrected LCV (at least 360°) without resection and recovered from anaesthesia. Ultrasound of the ventral large colon was performed at the time of anaesthetic recovery and every 6?8?h until the colon wall returned to normal thickness (≤5?mm). Outcome was evaluated using a one-way ANOVA to compare average time to colon wall involution between: 1) survivors and nonsurvivors; and 2) horses that developed multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) during the post operative period and those that recovered without evidence of MODS. Results: Sixteen horses that recovered without evidence of MODS had a significantly shorter period to colon wall involution (≤5?mm) compared to those diagnosed with MODS (mean ± s.e. 19.6?h ± 2.5 and 39.7?h ± 6.7 respectively, P = 0.006). There was no significant difference in mean period to colon wall involution between survivors and nonsurvivors (26.2 ± 4.9 and 33.2 ± 7.8?h, respectively). Conclusions: A shorter time to colon wall involution was associated with decreased post operative morbidity in horses presented for surgical correction of large colon volvulus without resection. Potential relevance: Ultrasonographic monitoring of colon wall involution after surgical correction of LCV may aid in identifying those cases at risk of MODS. Further investigation of colon wall involution time using a larger number of horses is warranted.

AB  - Abstract Background Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (CLT) is an autoimmune disease commonly associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma characterized by a smaller primary tumor size at presentation. The efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) coexisting with CLT is still unknown. Methods Sixty patients with unifocal PTMC were enrolled and classified into PTMC and PTMC+CLT groups (n = 30/group). CLT was diagnosed histopathologically. The ablation area exceeded the tumor margins, and was evaluated by US and contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) for residual tumor to prevent recurrence. Three months after ablation, US-guided core-needle biopsy was performed to assess the presence of residual and recurrent cancer. Preoperative and postoperative data on patients and tumors were recorded and analyzed. Results There were no differences between groups in age, sex, preoperative tumor volume, ablation time, or ablation power (P > 0.05). There was also no significant difference in postoperative ablation zone volume between the groups at the 1-, 3-, 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-ups (P > 0.05). The volume reduction rate significantly differed between the two groups at month 3 (P = 0.03). The ablation area could not be identified on US and CEUS at 9.8 ± 5.0 and 10.0 ± 4.8 months in the PTMC and PTMC + CLT groups, respectively (P = 0.197). No serious complications occurred during and after ablation. No residual cancer cells were found on biopsy after ablation. Conclusions RFA was effective in patients with PTMC+CLT, and its therapeutic efficacy and safety were similar to those in patients with PTMC without CLT.

AB  - Abstract Blunt and penetrating trauma is common in small animal patients, accounting for a large number of emergency room visits. Rapid recognition and treatment of abnormalities in tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery is essential to ensure patient survival and decrease the risk for the development of the systemic inflammatory response and MODS. Knowledge of trauma patterns in dogs and cats can help the emergency veterinarian rapidly identify injuries associated with trauma and allow for directed care. Animal trauma scoring systems are useful to help identify more severely injured patients, evaluate hospital outcomes and for patient stratification for clinical trials.

AB  - For a number of years the teaching of ultrasound principles has relied on slides of static, nonreal-time images. Although ultrasound originally employed only still images, the development of real-time ultrasound ushered in a new imaging modality. Unfortunately, the presentation of real-time images has not been incorporated into most presentations because of the difficulty of preparing and editing video tape recordings of the examination. With the advent of multimedia programs available for the laptop and desktop computer, it is now possible to display real-time motion sequences that duplicate the actual scanning environment. To accomplish this, however, requires the physician to become versed in the various techniques required to capture video and audio sequences from the ultrasound machine. In addition, the proper computer software must be used to optimize these images. The purpose of this presentation is to review the methodology required to (1) acquire the highest quality video images from the ultrasound machine, (2) convert the ultrasound images from a analog-to-digital format, (3) review programs required to optimize the converted digital images, and (4) examine the software programs to optimally display these images for the Windows and Macintosh platforms. At the conclusion of the presentation, the physician should be able to accomplish these tasks.

More recently, lung ultrasound gained importance throughout artefacts analysis to help clinical evaluation at bedside and became subject of interest in the paediatric intensive care and emergency department settings for both procedural and diagnostic purposes. The normal pattern of lung ultrasound is defined by the presence of lung sliding associated with A-lines whereas B-lines may be representative of pathologic findings. This review focuses on some of the most common pulmonary conditions, their respective sonographic features and clinical implications in the emergency department and paediatric intensive care unit.

AB  - Development during the past 5?years increased significantly the quality of ultrasound mammography. After trying to receive better image quality by using higher and higher frequencies up to 20 Mhz the todays breakthrough was reached by better scan converter and transducer technology. Broadband tranducers, harmonic imaging, Siescape, Angio-powerdoppler, SonoCT, 3-D imaging and the use of contrast agent improved not only image but diagnostic quality of the method. The better scin, nipple, ductal an microcalcification visualization in combination with better mass delineation allowed a diagnostic accuracy equally or better than X-ray mammography. Ultrasound mammography is the logical examination following breast palpation, can complement mammography in all patients, substitute too frequent mammography controls and save unnecessary MRIs. Unfortunately the method suffers from lack of qualified education & training, qualified users and qualified payment. Gynecologists, radiologists and surgeons should struggle together to establish the method in a appropriate way ? in the interest of all women.

AB  - Legal regulation of the safety of medical applications of ultrasound is important for protection of the patients and physicians. The matter of ultrasound safety has recently been regulated in Croatia within the framework of the law on nonionising radiation protection. The law as approved by the parliament regulates the general principles and material cornerstones while the details are defined by rules and regulations issued by the Ministry of Health. Apart from medical applications ultrasound is used in plastic and metal welding, food processing, cleaning, electroplating, drilling and metal flaw detection, to mention but some. The law had to be general and sufficiently cover the whole spectrum allowing for the special medical exception. Namely, the medical professional may breach the integrity of human body and even harm the patient if the expected net final result of the whole proceeding is expected to help the person who seeks help. The law in Croatia states that ultrasound may not increase the temperature of the human body to more than 38.5?°C and may not induce cavitation there. However medical applications of ultrasound are specifically excluded from this limitation. The requirement is the application of the ALARA principle. The specifics of the regulation of the total field of medical applications of ultrasound are now being prepared under consideration of the existing and the presently processed IEC from IEC committees TC 62 and TC 87 documents and taking into account the present regulation in the USA.

AB  - Abstract Equine temporomandibular joint (TMJ) diseases are increasingly recognized as a problem for the well-being and performance of horses. Diagnosis is confounded by overlap of clinical signs associated with pathology of the oral cavity, poll, and cervical vertebrae. Arthrocentesis for intra-articular analgesia, sampling of synovial fluid, and medication is needed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Ultrasound features of the normal TMJ and a blind arthrocentesis technique have been described, but a systematic approach to ultrasound-guided (USG) arthrocentesis has not been reported. Ultrasound guidance allows visualization of the TMJ that may prove beneficial in cases when pathology, abnormal anatomy, or clinician inexperience make blind arthrocentesis difficult. We hypothesized that USG arthrocentesis would result in fewer needle repositions than blind arthrocentesis. We also aimed to assess synovial fluid parameters for normal equine TMJs. A prospective randomized method comparison with crossover experimental design compared the number of needle positionings required for accurate injection of the TMJ using each technique. Arthrocentesis technique and operator experience were tested using cadavers and two operators. Injection success was confirmed using CT. The radiologist then applied both techniques in normal live horses. No statistically significant difference was noted between arthrocentesis techniques or operators (P > .05). No complications were observed in live horses following either technique. Synovial fluid parameters were largely within the normal range expected for other synovial joints. Either blind or USG arthrocentesis of the equine TMJ can be performed with minimal prior operator experience. Ultrasound-guided arthrocentesis is an alternative method and can be considered in cases with altered anatomy.

AB  - Abstract Ultrasound medical applications, such as an ultrasound imaging with micro-bubble contrast agents, and high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy have attracted much attention in recent years. These applications have a close relation to the motion of micro-bubbles, so that it is essential to understand their dynamics. The bubble motion is influenced by the internal phenomena and its interaction with the surrounding medium, such as the thermal diffusion, the mist formation, the mass diffusion, the heat and mass transfer through the bubble wall. It is important that the oscillation of micro bubbles generates a strong acoustic pressure for these medical applications. The strong pressure also appears in the case of a bubble cluster, like a cloud cavitation. As these dynamics of bubbles are strongly influenced by the thermal phenomena inside them, it is necessary to construct the model taking these phenomena into account to analyse the behaviour of the bubble cluster precisely. Thus, the following effects are considered: the evaporation and condensation of the liquid at the bubble wall, the heat transfer through the bubble wall, and the compressibility of the liquid. Then the spherical bubble cluster is numerically simulated. When the frequency of the ultrasound is sufficiently high, the bubble cluster hardly oscillates. On the contrary, when the frequency of the ultrasound is at the resonance of the bubble cluster, the pressure wave generates the shock wave and it focuses to the cluster centre. As a result, the pressure inside the bubble at the cluster centre becomes much higher than that of a single bubble. Though this extreme high pressure causes the severe cavitation erosion, it is thought that this high energy concentration has the potential to be utilized for medical applications.

AB  - Hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) offers multiple benefits and some risks to many postmenopausal women, especially to those whose menopause occurred before age 45. Improvements of image resolution by transvaginal sonography allow the investigation of very delicate anatomical structures such as the endometrium. Various diagnostic criteria including thickness and volume of endometrium, internal structure and myometrial involvement help to identify endometrial abnormality. The benefits of technologies such as sonohysterography, Doppler and 3D ultrasound are being assessed. In the postmenopausal patient without hormonal substitution, endometrial pathology may be diagnosed by measuring endometrial thickness alone. In women with postmenopausal bleeding, endometrial atrophy as the must common cause has been differentiated from endometrial cancer with a high success rate. Considering that the majority of diagnostic endometrial biopsies reveal a benign pathology, Doppler ultrasound may significantly reduce the number of these procedures. In patients with HRT, the measurement of endometrial thickness is not reliable to predict pathology. In this situation, ultrasound examination of the endometrial/myometrial border or endometrial blood flow is advantageous. Transvaginal ultrasound and Doppler blood flow analysis could prove helpful in selection and follow up of patients on HRT and maybe to prevent some unwanted endometrial effects.

AB  - The introduction of real time ultrasound to transcervical chorionic villus biopsy allowed successful collection from 65% of 107 consecutive studied patients. The collection rate was obtained despite the need for time to develop scanning skills and a limit of only two attempts at biopsy. The quantity in 69% of biopsy samples was· considered sufficient for use in prenatal diagnosis. Biopsy was most successful between 8 and 10 weeks gestation. No amniotic sac was perforated. Bleeding of varying severity associated with 65% of biopsies was not improved despite use of ultrasound. Both linear array or sector scanners were suitable for our purpose. Clarity of the scan picture is affected by many factors. Successful biopsy is not always dependent on visualisation of the placenta or tip of the collecting cannula. Apart from expertise and ultrasound guidance, better design in biopsy implements can improve successful collection to levels acceptable for clinical applications.
