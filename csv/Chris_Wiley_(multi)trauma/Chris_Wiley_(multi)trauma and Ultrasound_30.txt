AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to illustrate the baseline appearance and enhancement patterns of splenic hemangiomas on contrast-enhanced sonography. Methods Two experienced radiologists retrospectively reviewed by consensus baseline and contrast-enhanced sonographic examinations of 27 patients (14 women and 13 men; mean age, 58.7 years) with 27 splenic hemangiomas (mean size, 2 cm) confirmed by splenectomy, biopsy, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging and follow-up. Results On baseline sonography, 77.8% of the lesions showed a homogeneous echo texture that was mainly hyperechoic. Color Doppler imaging did not show any signal in 81.5% of the cases. After contrast agent injection, 59.2% of the splenic hemangiomas showed different degrees of contrast enhancement in the arterial phase followed by isoenhancement in the late parenchymal phase. Among these, 2 hemangiomas showed peripheral globular enhancement in the arterial phase, followed by progressive centripetal fill-in. In 29.6% of the cases, some degree of contrast enhancement was appreciable, but the hemangiomas remained substantially hypoechoic throughout the contrast-enhanced sonographic examinations, whereas in 11.1%, the combination of contrast enhancement in the arterial phase followed by wash-out in the late parenchymal phase was evident. Conclusions Isoechogenicity to spleen parenchyma in all phases is the most frequent typical enhancement pattern of splenic hemangiomas observed on contrast-enhanced sonography. Nevertheless, these lesions may show atypical contrast enhancement patterns; therefore, further assessment with cross-sectional techniques is needed.

AB  - A five-year-old, entire, male dachshund was presented with a five day history of hypersalivation and regurgitation as well as polyuria and polydipsia for several months. Chest radiographs demonstrated megaoesophagus and aspiration pneumonia. Furthermore, hyperadrenocorticism was demonstrated by means of elevations in levels of serum alkaline phosphatase and cholesterol, decreased urinary specific gravity, increased response to adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation, insufficient suppression of the post-dexamethasone plasma cortisol levels, an increased endogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone concentration and bilaterally enlarged adrenal glands on abdominal ultrasound. The dog became severely dyspnoeic and was euthanased after magnetic resonance imaging was performed. The magnetic resonance imaging and necropsy revealed the sellar region mainly filled with fluid, with only small tissue remnants, a condition defined as empty sella syndrome in human medicine. To the author?s knowledge, this is the first dog described with empty sella syndrome and only the second dog described with hyperadrenocorticism secondary to ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone production. However, the association between empty sella syndrome and hyperadrenocorticism may be no more than incidental.

AB  - Abstract Debate about the importance of the preterm patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) remains unresolved. Ultrasound studies of PDA have suggested that the haemodynamic impact may be much earlier after birth than previously thought, but we still do not know when to treat a PDA. Studies that have tested symptomatic or pre-symptomatic treatment are mainly historical and have not tested the effect of no treatment. Prophylactic treatment is the best studied regimen, but improvements in some short-term outcomes do not translate to any difference in longer term outcomes. Neonatologists have been reluctant to engage in trials that test treatment against not treating at all or very rarely. Targeting treatment on the basis of the early post-natal constrictive response of the duct is currently being tested as a possible strategy.

AB  - Historical, physical examination, clinicopathologic, radiographic and ultrasonographic findings of 13 dogs with hepatic abscesses were reviewed. Liver abscessation was characterized by number, size, shape, echogenicity and location. Solitary lesions greater than 3 cm were more common than multiple ones. The abscesses were mainly poorly echogenic lesions, often with central cavitation. The shape of the lesion ranged from round to oval or irregular. Enhancement artifact, abdominal effusion, regional lymphadenopathy and hyperechoic perihepatic fat, were identified in several dogs. Ultrasound-guided aspiration was performed in 10 of 13 dogs, and confirmed abscessation with cytologic and microbiologic evaluation. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage of abscesses was performed as an adjunct to medical management in four dogs.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There are limited data surrounding the efficacy of oviductal flushing in restoring fertility in mares with repeated returns to oestrus. Objectives To determine the conception and foaling rates in mares treated by laparoscopic topical application of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to the oviduct(s) in mares: i) in the breeding season (January?May), pre-covering; ii) in the breeding season, post covering; and iii) out of the breeding season (June?December). Study design Follow-up study. Methods Analysis of electronic patient records (EPRs) identified 29 mares that underwent oviductal flushing via laparoscopic surgery between 1 January 2008 and 12 October 2014. One mare underwent the procedure twice; once in the breeding season (pre-covering) and once out of the breeding season. Follow-up data were collected via EPRs and from Weatherbys (www.bloodstockreports.co.uk). Results The procedure was used in 27 Thoroughbreds, one Warmblood and one Hanoverian. Mean age at the time of the procedure was 13.1 years (range 6?22 years). Mean duration barren prior to the procedure was 1.9 years (range 49 days?5.6 years). The mean time post flushing to the first positive ultrasound scan was 31 days, with average time post flushing to foaling of 367.6 days. Of the 29 horses, 55.2% (16/29) conceived successfully, with 87.5% of these confirmed to have produced a live foal. In the breeding season, 16 mares were treated; 10 pre-covering, and 6 post covering with conception rates of 60.0% and 83.3%, respectively. Thirteen mares were treated out of the breeding season, with a 35.7% conception rate. Conclusions Oviductal flushing within the breeding season was more successful in this study than flushing performed out of the breeding season. Restoration of fertility in this study was lower than that previously reported and potential reasons for this include limited pre-surgical diagnostic testing, differing prior pathologies or reasons for sub-fertility, and case selection.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Blackthorn (Prunus spinosus) is recognised as causing infections and tissue reactions. Objectives To describe the presentation, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of blackthorn plant thorn synovitis in the horse. Study design Case series. Methods All cases in this prospective study presented with acute onset synovitis within 24?h of thorn penetration, had a standardised clinical assessment, surgical treatment and aftercare. Surgical treatment was performed within 24?h of presentation under general anaesthesia, using a 2-stage procedure: Stage 1: perisynovial technique. Ultrasound guided placement of a 20 gauge 35?mm needle marker that is used as a guide for electrosurgical dissection onto perisynovial thorn fragments. Stage 2: endoscopic technique. Using standard and novel portals to locate and remove thorn fragments and debris from synovial structures. Results Thirty-five cases met the study inclusion criteria over a 24 month period. Mean lameness score on presentation was 4/5 (range 1?5). The most commonly affected structures were fetlock joints (11/35) and tendon sheaths (10/35). Mean synovial fluid total protein was 50.5?g/l (range 18?116), and TNCC was 158?x?109 (range 21?412) on presentation and 12?x?109 (range 1?46) at 48?h post operatively. All synovial fluid cultures were negative. All horses were sound (grade 0) at 5 days post operatively and all returned to full work. Conclusions There are a limited number of case series of blackthorn injury in humans; however, the consensus is that surgical treatment is required for a successful outcome. The 2-stage surgical procedure described, achieved accurate identification and removal of thorn material in all cases. In contrast to previous studies on synovial sepsis, these cases had a positive outcome despite high pre- and post operative synovial fluid total protein and TNCC. These findings suggest that thorn synovitis cases have a different aetiology from synovitis originating from sepsis or contamination. Ethical animal research:?The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee, School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. Owners gave informed consent for their horses' inclusion in the study. Source of funding:?None. Competing interests:?None declared.

AB  - Abstract The art of healing wounds is quite complex. It requires the patient's local condition in conjunction with their systemic condition to provide the most ideal wound environment. As wound care is expanding with advances in technology, we are facing a variety of different wound care products based on an assortment of bioengineered skin substances, growth factors, oxygen therapies, low frequency ultrasound and even low energy light. While these emerging evidence-based treatments prove to be promising in improving clinical outcomes and quality of life, it challenges providers to provide cost-effective treatment plans. The goal of this paper is to introduce a discussion regarding practical clinical application of various forms of advanced wound technologies in order to optimize the art of wound healing.

AB  - Donation after circulatory death (DCD) liver transplantation (LT) reportedly yields inferior survival and increased complication rates compared with donation after brain death (DBD). We compare 100 consecutive DCD LT using a protocol that includes thrombolytic therapy (late DCD group) to an historical DCD group (early DCD group n = 38) and a cohort of DBD LT recipients (DBD group n = 435). Late DCD LT recipients had better 1- and 3-year graft survival rates than early DCD LT recipients (92% vs. 76.3%, p = 0.03 and 91.4% vs. 73.7%, p = 0.01). Late DCD graft survival rates were comparable to those of the DBD group (92% vs. 93.3%, p = 0.24 and 91.4% vs. 88.2%, p = 0.62). Re-transplantation occurred in 18.4% versus 1% for the early and late DCD groups, respectively (p = 0.001). Patient survival was similar in all three groups. Ischemic-type biliary lesions (ITBL) occurred in 5%, 3%, and 0.2% for early DCD, late DCD, and DBD groups, respectively, but unlike in the early DCD group, in the late DCD group ITBL was endoscopically managed and resolved in each case. Using a protocol that includes a thrombolytic therapy, DCD LT yielded patient and graft survival rates comparable to DBD LT.

AB  - A 12-year-old crossbred dog (case 1) and a 12-year-old Shetland sheepdog (case 2) were presented with a history of lameness and distal limb swelling. Physical examination revealed joint effusions and asymmetrical swellings of the extremities. In case 1, a diagnosis of arthritis and cellulitis was made on fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the synovium and subcutis. In case 2, bone biopsies and synovial aspirates diagnosed osteomyelitis and arthritis. A diagnosis of pancreatic disease was made on the findings of marked elevations of serum lipase concentrations and ultrasonographic identification of pancreatic masses in both cases. Both the cases were non-responsive to symptomatic management and were subsequently euthanased. Postmortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of panniculitis, arthritis and osteomyelitis in both cases. A pancreatic exocrine adenoma was identified in case 1 and a pancreatic adenocarcinoma with widespread metastases in case 2. To the authors' knowledge the association of panniculitis, polyarthritis and osteomyelitis with pancreatic disorders has not been reported previously in canine clinical cases.

AB  - Abstract Transverse uterine fundal cesarean section in cases of total placenta previa reduces blood loss, but its influence on subsequent pregnancies, including the uterine rupture risk, remains unclear. We report a case of uterine rupture due to placenta percreta in the first trimester in a 43-year-old woman who underwent transverse uterine fundal incision in a previous pregnancy (at 40 years old). The patient did not undergo assessment of the uterine scare after the previous operation. Oocyte donation and in vitro fertilization at another institution resulted in the current pregnancy. At 11 weeks 3 days, she was admitted to the emergency department because of sudden severe abdominal pain. Ultrasound showed massive accumulation of free fluid in the peritoneal cavity and the fetus was outside the uterine cavity; uterine rupture was diagnosed. During emergency laparotomy, the uterine rupture was detected at exactly the previous incision site; a total hysterectomy was performed. Pregnancy after a transverse uterine fundal cesarean section is at high risk. As uterine scar dehiscence might have caused the uterine rupture, wounds should be evaluated before allowing subsequent pregnancies.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Guidelines for the rational use of antimicrobials enable practitioners to improve antimicrobial stewardship and slow the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) [1]; these must be regionally relevant [2]. New Zealand (NZ) is geographically isolated and the importance of AMR on equine studs is unknown. Objectives To identify AMR patterns of bacteria isolated from NZ foals so as to provide regionally specific information for the development of antimicrobial stewardship guidelines. Study design Retrospective study of clinical pathology records. Methods A database search of bacterial culture submissions from foals <3 weeks of age from April 2004 to December 2013 was completed. Culture results, antimicrobial sensitivities, and demographic factors were tabulated. The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion susceptibility test was used to define sensitivity. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) was defined as non-sensitivity to 3 or more core antimicrobials in a panel (ceftiofur, enrofloxaxin, gentamicin, penicillin [not included for Gram-negative bacteria], tetracycline, trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole). Results Bacterial isolates (n?=?127) were cultured from 64/102 (62.7%) of foal submissions. Four bacterial groups (Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli) accounted for 100 (79%) of bacterial isolates cultured. At least one or 2 MDR isolates were cultured from 24 (38%) and 8 (12%) foals, respectively. Culture positive and negative foals were demographically similar. Conclusions A significant number of bacterial isolates from foals have reduced antimicrobial susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial drugs. The results are of concern from treatment and stewardship perspectives. Multi-drug resistance was found, indicating a need for regionally relevant antimicrobial use recommendations.

AB  - The prophylactic use of rhesus immunoglobulin has led to a significant reduction in the incidence of haemolytic disease of the newborn secondary to rhesus alloimmunisation, which now only occurs in 1 in 1000 live births. Despite prophylaxis, antibodies to the D antigen are still the commonest cause of rhesus isoimmunisation. Although now a rare pregnancy disorder rhesus isoimmunisation continues to be a challenging obstetric complication and while the face of this disease has undergone many changes over recent years, the principles of management remain unchanged. Pregnancies at risk of the disease are identified by past obstetric history and the antenatal detection of red cell antibodies with serial measurement of antibody levels. In cases of heterozygous paternity the real risk of fetal disease can be determined using new DNA techniques to determine the fetal blood cell type with tissue obtained from amniocentesis, and now by molecular analysis of circulating fetal DNA in the maternal plasma and serum. Sensitised pregnancies are monitored for the development of fetal anaemia. Since its introduction into clinical practise by Liley over 40?years ago, spectral analysis of amniotic fluid bilirubin as an indirect measure of fetal haemolysis has been the primary method of screening for fetal anaemia. Noninvasive evaluation is now possible with the use of doppler ultrasound to detect changes to fetal blood flow secondary to fetal anaemia, most commonly using the middle cerebral artery, and ultrasound evaluation of fetal haemopoetic organs and for the diagnosis of hydrops. Ultrasound guided intrauterine transfusion of red blood cells remains the treatment for the severely affected fetus. Perinatal survival rates in the non hydropic fetus are reported at over 90% and long term studies have revealed normal neurological outcomes for more than 90% cases.

AB  - Summary.? Recent advances in imaging have enhanced our understanding of the morphological adaptations of muscle in response to disease and altered use. Adaptation in muscle morphology has been linked to changes in muscle strength. To date, no studies have compared muscle morphology and strength in young children with haemophilia to that of typically developing children. This study explored differences in muscle strength and morphology between typically developing and age and size-matched boys aged 6?12?years with haemophilia and a history of recurrent haemorrhage in the ankle joint. Maximum muscle strength of the knee flexors (KF), extensors (KE), ankle dorsi (ADF) and plantar flexors (APF) was measured in 19 typically developing boys (Group 1) and 19 boys with haemophilia (Group 2). Ultrasound images of vastus lateralis (VL) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) were recorded to determine muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), thickness, width, fascicle length and pennation angle. Muscle strength of the KE, ADF and APF were significantly (P?<?0.05) lower in Group 2 when compared with Group 1. Muscle CSA and width of VL were significantly smaller and pennation angles significantly larger in Group 2 (P?<?0.05). Muscle CSA and thickness of LG were significantly (P?<?0.05) smaller in Group 2. Linear regression showed that LG muscle CSA and thickness were significant (P?<?0.01) predictors of APF muscle strength. Following ankle joint bleeding in young boys with haemophilia, secondary adaptations in muscle strength and morphology were observed, suggesting that muscle function is more impaired than current clinical evaluations imply.
