AB  - Summary.? Recent advances in imaging have enhanced our understanding of the morphological adaptations of muscle in response to disease and altered use. Adaptation in muscle morphology has been linked to changes in muscle strength. To date, no studies have compared muscle morphology and strength in young children with haemophilia to that of typically developing children. This study explored differences in muscle strength and morphology between typically developing and age and size-matched boys aged 6?12?years with haemophilia and a history of recurrent haemorrhage in the ankle joint. Maximum muscle strength of the knee flexors (KF), extensors (KE), ankle dorsi (ADF) and plantar flexors (APF) was measured in 19 typically developing boys (Group 1) and 19 boys with haemophilia (Group 2). Ultrasound images of vastus lateralis (VL) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) were recorded to determine muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), thickness, width, fascicle length and pennation angle. Muscle strength of the KE, ADF and APF were significantly (P?<?0.05) lower in Group 2 when compared with Group 1. Muscle CSA and width of VL were significantly smaller and pennation angles significantly larger in Group 2 (P?<?0.05). Muscle CSA and thickness of LG were significantly (P?<?0.05) smaller in Group 2. Linear regression showed that LG muscle CSA and thickness were significant (P?<?0.01) predictors of APF muscle strength. Following ankle joint bleeding in young boys with haemophilia, secondary adaptations in muscle strength and morphology were observed, suggesting that muscle function is more impaired than current clinical evaluations imply.

AB  - Abstract Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) causes adverse pregnancy outcomes that can be averted by treatment from 24?28 weeks? gestation. Assessing and treating women for overt diabetes in pregnancy (ODIP) at the first antenatal clinic booking is now recommended in international guidelines. As a consequence, women with milder hyperglycaemia are being diagnosed and treated for early GDM, but randomised controlled trial (RCTs) assessing the benefits and harms of such treatment have not been undertaken. The Treatment Of Booking Gestational diabetes Mellitus (TOBOGM) study is a multi-centre RCT examining whether diagnosing and treating GDM diagnosed at booking improves pregnancy outcomes. Methods and analysis: 4000 adult pregnant women (< 20 weeks? gestation) at risk of ODIP will be recruited from 12 hospital antenatal booking clinics and referred for an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). 800 women with hyperglycaemia (ie, booking GDM) according to the 2014 Australasian Diabetes-in-Pregnancy Society criteria for pregnant women at 24?28 weeks? gestation will be randomised to immediate treatment for GDM (intervention) or to no treatment (control), pending the results of a second OGTT at 24?28 weeks? gestation. Antenatal and GDM care will otherwise follow local guidelines. Randomisation will be stratified by site and OGTT glycaemic risk strata. The primary pregnancy outcome is a composite of respiratory distress, phototherapy, birth trauma, birth before 37 weeks? gestation, stillbirth or death, shoulder dystocia, and birthweight ≥ 4.5 kg. The primary neonatal outcome is neonatal lean body mass. The primary maternal outcome is pre-eclampsia. Ethics approval: South Western Sydney Local Health District Research and Ethics Office (reference, 15/LPOOL/551). Dissemination of results: Peer-reviewed publications, scientific meetings, collaboration with research groups undertaking comparable studies, discussions with guideline groups and policy makers.

AB  - Learning disability and cerebral palsy are often related to factors present before birth. We report three patients (two with schizencephaly, one with unilateral cerebellar agenesis) in whom the timing of an insult to the foetus was known. In the first case, the mother had a trauma at 16 weeks of pregnancy and schizencephaly was discovered in the male infant associated with a left hemiplegia. In the second child, amniocentesis performed at 16 weeks into pregnancy may have been responsible for the same cortical anomaly. In the third case, sequential foetal echographies clearly demonstrated that an apparent unilateral cerebellar agenesis was related to an haemorrhagic event secondary to cerebellar trauma that occurred at 19 weeks of pregnancy. It is suggested that these brain malformations are related to an ischemic mechanism or a traumatic event in foetal life.

AB  - ABSTRACT Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a diverse pathologic process, defined as the formation of extraskeletal bone in muscle and soft tissues. HO can be conceptualized as a tissue repair process gone awry and is a common complication of trauma and surgery. This comprehensive review seeks to synthesize the clinical, pathoetiologic, and basic biologic features of HO, including nongenetic and genetic forms. First, the clinical features, radiographic appearance, histopathologic diagnosis, and current methods of treatment are discussed. Next, current concepts regarding the mechanistic bases for HO are discussed, including the putative cell types responsible for HO formation, the inflammatory milieu and other prerequisite ?niche? factors for HO initiation and propagation, and currently available animal models for the study of HO of this common and potentially devastating condition. ? 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Patellofemoral instability (PFI) is one of the most disabling conditions in the knee, often affecting young individuals. Despite its not uncommon presentation, the underlying biomechanical features leading to this entity are not entirely understood. The suitability of classic physical examination manoeuvres and imaging tests is a matter of discussion among treating surgeons, and so are the findings provided by these means. A potential cause for this lack of consensus is the fact that, classically, the diagnostic approach for PFI has relied on statically obtained data. Many authors advocate for the study of this entity in a dynamic scenario, closer to the actual situation in which the instability episodes occur. In this literature review, we have compiled the available data from the last decades regarding dynamic evaluation methods for PFI and related conditions. Several categories are presented, grouping the related techniques and devices: physical examination, imaging modalities (ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) and combined methods), arthroscopic evaluation, and others. In conclusion, although a vast number of quality studies are presented, in which comprehensive data about the biomechanics of the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) are described, this evidence has not yet reached clinical practice universally. Most of the data still stays in the research field and is seldom employed to assist a better understanding of the PFI cases and their ideal treatment targets.

AB  - This report describes a case of severe spontaneous tension pneumopericardium with concurrent pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax and retropneumoperitoneum in a cat presenting with dyspnoea and signs of cardiac tamponade secondary to metastatic pulmonary carcinoma. Spontaneous pneumopericardium is an extremely uncommon condition consisting of pericardial gas in the absence of iatrogenic/traumatic causes. In humans, it has been described secondary to pneumonia or lung abscess and very rarely secondary to pulmonary neoplasia.

AB  - Summary This case report describes a geriatric gelding with a 2 month history of fast-growing masses within the parotid and submandibular regions. The horse was dyspnoeic on presentation and upper airway endoscopy revealed partial airway obstruction at the level of the pharynx, secondary to a space-occupying mass. Cytological evaluation of multiple fine-needle aspirates obtained from the masses were suggestive of salivary gland neoplasia, therefore the horse was subjected to humane euthanasia. A computed tomographical scan was obtained post mortem and revealed a large multi-lobulated mass involving both guttural pouches, resulting in 80% occlusion of the naso- and oropharynx. Histopathology confirmed a parotid salivary gland carcinoma (papillary-cystic type). Salivary gland tumours are extremely rare in horses, with only a few cases reported in the literature. Treatment of these malignancies proves to be challenging, requiring complete parotidectomy or surgical debulkment, in combination with adjunctive therapy.

AB  - Purpose? The comprehensive describtion of the epidemiology of pelvic ring fractures (PRF) including high-energy PRF, low-energy PRF and those who die during the prehospital phase (pre-H). Methods? 12-month prospective population based study was performed in a trauma system with one Level-1 trauma centre and seven referring hospitals (population: 0.6 million). Data were collected on all PRF from the trauma system including high-energy, low energy fractures and pre-H deaths with PRF. Patient demographics, injury severity score (ISS), mortality (%) and PRF-related mortality were recorded prospectively. All high-energy deaths had autopsy at the same forensic pathology department. Data presented as percentages (%) or mean +/? SEM. Results? During the 12-month period 138 patients suffered PRF (45% male, 59+/?2 years, ISS 20+/?2, 21% mortality and 8% PRF-related mortality). Sixty-four % of the low-energy and 92% of the high-energy patients were transferred directly to the trauma center. There were 57 high-energy (71% male, 41+/?3 years, ISS 23+/?3, 14% mortality, 7% PRF-related mortality) 63 low-energy (20% male, 81+/?1 years, ISS 6+/?1, 5% mortality, 2% PRF-related mortality) and 18 pre-H died patients with PRF (47% male, 41+/?6 years, ISS 61+/?4, 100% mortality, 33% PRF-related mortality). PRF-related mortality was always due to bleeding. Conclusions? The majority of PRF-related mortality occurs pre-H. Half of the multiple-injured high-energy PRF patients still die because of the pelvic bleeding. Further preventive measures and optimization of the care of PRF patients is required. Trauma centre admission of 2/3 of the low-energy PRF is a significant load and should be further investigated in an inclusive trauma system.

AB  - Abstract Objectives: Renal transplantation is a well-accepted therapeutic option for patients with end stage renal disease. Renal artery stenosis occurring in a transplanted kidney is a potentially serious condition and adversely affects graft survival and prognosis. The objective of this study is to document the immediate and intermediate term clinical results of renal stenting in this rare subset of renal artery stenosis. Background: There is limited data about the effectiveness of renal stenting in transplant renal artery stenosis. Methods: Eight patients, aged between 22 and 51 (42.5 ± 9.25) years, were referred to our tertiary care interventional cardiology services for renal intervention. The diagnosis of transplant renal artery stenosis was based on clinical presentation (uncontrolled hypertension (n = 4, 50%), worsening renal function (n = 3, 37.5%) or flash pulmonary oedema (n = 1, 12.5%)] and Doppler ultrasound. Results: All patients had live donor renal transplant using end to end anastomosis 2 to 11 (6.25 ± 3.24) months prior to intervention. Angiography revealed discrete stenosis at the anastomotic site. Intrarenal stenting performed from femoral access using 6 F accessories produced excellent angiographic results. There were no access site or procedure related complications. The intervention produced excellent immediate and intermediate term clinical results. In three patients, there was stabilization of renal function during 62 ± 9.16 months of follow-up with decrease in serum creatinine by 38.86 ± 6.62 %; P = 0.0476. In four patients with refractory hypertension, excellent blood pressure control was achieved with a reduction in mean blood pressure by 25.95 ± 5.48 mm Hg (from 122.4 ± 5.7 to 96.45 ± 2.45 mm Hg; P = 0.0002) during 65.25 ± 23.79 months follow-up. There was decrease in antihypertensive drug requirement from 3.75 ± 0.5 to 1.75 ± 0.5. During follow-up, Doppler ultrasound documented a high peak systolic velocity in one asymptomatic patient with well controlled blood pressure and preserved renal function. Sustained benefits of percutaneous revascularization were supported by normal Doppler parameters in the remaining patients. Conclusions: Percutaneous renal stenting provides excellent angiographic and clinical results sustained at intermediate term follow-up in patients with symptomatic transplant renal artery stenosis. ? 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report perioperative characteristics, complications, histopathologic diagnosis and outcome in cats undergoing surgical treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Study design Multi-institutional, retrospective case series. Animals Thirty-two client-owned cats. Methods Medical records of cats treated with surgical removal of 1 or more parathyroid gland(s) with confirmed histopathologic evaluation were reviewed. Cats were divided into preoperative ionized calcium (iCa) groups corresponding to the 33rd, 67th, and 100th percentiles of the preoperative iCa results of the study population. Follow-up consisted of phone conversation with owners or primary veterinarian. Results Ionized calcium was above reference range in all cats (median 1.8?mmol/L [interquartile range, 1.5?1.9]). Abnormal tissue was excised after cervical exploration in all cats. The most common histopathologic diagnoses were parathyroid adenoma in 20 of 32 (62.5%) cats and parathyroid carcinoma in 7 of 32 (21.9%) cats. At discharge, 6 of 32 (18.8%) cats had hypercalcemia, 5 of 32 (15.6%) had hypocalcemia, and 21 of 32 (65.6%) were normocalcemic. Preoperative iCa did not correlate with postoperative iCa. The median follow-up time was 332?days (range, 7?3156). Overall median survival time was 1109?days (95% CI, 856?1332). Survival time was not associated with preoperative iCa group, hypocalcemia at discharge, hypercalcemia at discharge, or diagnosis of carcinoma. Conclusion In this cohort of cats, parathyroid adenoma was the most common cause of PHPT, and surgical treatment resulted in very good median survival time. Preoperative iCa was not predictive of postoperative hypocalcemia. Clinical significance Surgical parathyroidectomy for treatment of PHPT in cats provides a favorable prognosis.

AB  - Abstract Background Beating-heart intracardiac surgery promises significant benefits for patients compared with cardiopulmonary bypass based procedures. However, the fast motions of the heart introduce serious challenges for surgeons. Methods In this work, a new impedance-controlled master?slave telerobotic system is developed to help perform anchor deployment for mitral valve annuloplasty under the guidance of live ultrasound images of the heart. The proposed bilateral teleoperation system can both reflect the non-oscillatory portion of slave?heart tissue interaction force on the surgeon's hand as haptic feedback and implement rapid compensation for the beating heart's motion. The surgical task involves performing anchor deployment on a simulated moving heart tissue to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy for safely interacting with a moving organ. Results and Conclusions The results obtained show that the telerobotic system increases the success rate of anchor deployment by 100% and reduces the excess force application rate by 70% compared with manual attempts.

AB  - Abstract Childhood pyogenic hepatic abscess is rare and remains a difficult diagnostic problem. Seven cases in six children were treated over a 13 year period. There was a recurrence in one patient 7 years after the first presentation. Four patients had identified predisposing factors, namely, chronic granulomatous disease, acute appendicitis, previous abdominal surgery and umbilical vein catheterization, while the other two were cryptogenic. There were no specific symptoms and signs but the combination of unexplained pyrexia, upper abdominal tenderness, hepatomegaly and leucocytosis should raise the suspicion of hepatic abscess. Four cases were diagnosed by ultrasound, one by radionuclide scan and the other two at laparotomy. Treatment in the earlier years was by transabdominal drainage. In the later part of the series, percutaneous catheter drainage using ultrasound guidance was achieved with satisfactory result. Ultrasonography can provide an early diagnosis and effective treatment can be achieved with percutaneous catheter drainage in combination with appropriate antibiotic therapy.

AB  - Abstract The incidence of chronic wounds is increased among older adults, and the impact of chronic wounds on quality of life is particularly profound in this population. It is well established that wound healing slows with age. However, the basic biology underlying chronic wounds and the influence of age-associated changes on wound healing are poorly understood. Most studies have used in vitro approaches and various animal models, but observed changes translate poorly to human healing conditions. The impact of age and accompanying multi-morbidity on the effectiveness of existing and emerging treatment approaches for chronic wounds is also unknown, and older adults tend to be excluded from randomized clinical trials. Poorly defined outcomes and variables, lack of standardization in data collection, and variations in the definition, measurement, and treatment of wounds also hamper clinical studies. The Association of Specialty Professors, in conjunction with the National Institute on Aging and the Wound Healing Society, held a workshop, summarized in this paper, to explore the current state of knowledge and research challenges, engage investigators across disciplines, and identify key research questions to guide future study of age-associated changes in chronic wound healing.
