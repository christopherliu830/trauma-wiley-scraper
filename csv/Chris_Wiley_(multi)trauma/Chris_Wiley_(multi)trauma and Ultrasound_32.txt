AB  - Background and Objective Striae distensae (SD) are cutaneous lesions that often occur on the breasts, abdomen, hips, and thighs. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new technique using a non-invasive Er:YAG laser combined with Spatially Modulated Ablation (SMA) module for the treatment of SD. Study Design/Materials and Methods This prospective pilot clinical study included 20 patients with skin phototypes I to IV who are affected by SD. The Er:YAG 2940?nm laser with SMA module was used in scanning mode with fluences of 2.3?J/cm2, frequency of 3?Hz, and pulse duration of 0.3 milliseconds. The laser beam is split into several microspots and penetrates only by 50??m in the epidermis thickness. This technology induces also the generation of acoustic waves to stimulate tissue regeneration. Each patient underwent six laser sessions. An objective and subjective assessment of SD were used. All adverse events were reported. Results Most patients reported good improvement and expressed their satisfaction with the treatment. Cutometric analysis showed significant improvement in skin elasticity at the end of study. Moreover, ultrasound analysis revealed an increase in dermal thickness (P?<?0.01). POSAS scores decreased significantly at 3 and 6 months, reflecting improved skin quality. The average recovery time was 5 days, with no adverse effects reported. Conclusion Using Er:YAG laser (2,940?nm) with SMA technology to treat SD resulted in improved volume and textural appearance without side effects. The elasticity and thickness of the dermis also improved. The Er:YAG laser with SMA module may be considered as a novel and effective technique to treat SD lesions with minimal time recovery.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? There is strong evidence obtained from controlled trials that supports the use of biopsychosocial multidisciplinary interventions for chronic pain. Yet, studies of the clinical effectiveness and routine application of these approaches in real world settings are rare. This clinical evaluation sought to prospectively track changes in physical (e.g., pain severity, pain-related disability) and psychological (e.g., pain anxiety, pain self-efficacy) outcomes following usual care intervention at a large pain medicine centre (PMC). The degree to which improvements in physical and psychological outcomes were related to patient satisfaction was also examined. Methods:? One hundred and nine (M age?=?56.32 years, 51.4% female, pain chronicity Mdn?=?5 years) of 141 invited patients who attended the PMC for the first time over a 4-month period completed a pretreatment questionnaire comprised of standardised measures of pain, psychological function, and social background. Forty-three and 46 patients completed the 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments respectively, which also included measures of patient satisfaction. Results:? Wiithin the initial 3 months of treatment there were no significant declines in reported pain intensity, yet patients reported significant improvements in pain relief (p?<?0.05). Patients who completed the 3-month follow-up questionnaire reported significantly reduced levels of disability (p?<?0.05), less frequent episodes of fearful appraisal and pain avoidance (p?<?0.05), and a reduction in catastrophizing pain coping responses (p?<?0.02). At 6 months, patients did not report any further improvements in physical and psychological function beyond what they had achieved within the first 3 months. Preliminary findings suggest that patient satisfaction with treatment is significantly related to perceived reductions in disability (p?<?0.05) and improvements in self-efficacy for coping with pain (p?<?0.01), yet not significantly related to changes in pain coping style. Conclusions:? These findings highlight the importance of measuring treatment outcomes prospectively across different time points in view of the initial improvement in outcome and subsequent plateau observed here. Furthermore, these preliminary results suggest the centrality of patient beliefs pertaining to disability and confidence in their ability to cope when examining the effectiveness of pain interventions.

AB  - Abstract Background We previously reported a prospective study showing axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is associated with increased breast skin thickening during and 6 weeks post-radiation therapy (RT), and now report ALND's long-term impact at 1 year. Methods Among 66 women who received whole breast RT after lumpectomy, objective ultrasound measurements of epidermal thickness over four quadrants of the treated breast were measured at five time points: before RT, week 6 of RT, and 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year post-RT. Skin thickness ratio (STRA) was generated by normalizing for corresponding measurements of the contralateral breast. Results A total of 2,436 ultrasound images were obtained. Among 63 women with evaluable data at 1 year, mean STRA significantly increased at 6 months (absolute mean increase of 65%, SD 0.054), and remained elevated at 1 year post-RT (absolute mean increase of 44%, SD 0.048). In multivariable analysis, ALND compared to sentinel lymph node biopsy, longer interval between surgery and RT, increased baseline STRA, and Caucasian race predicted for more severe changes in STRA at 1 year compared to baseline (all P?<?.05). Conclusions In the setting of whole breast RT, our findings suggest that ALND has long-term repercussions on breast skin thickening.

AB  - Background: Repeated hypoxia and surgical trauma trigger a potent neuroendocrine response and their association is thought to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of multi-organ dysfunction. We investigated the cardiovascular and metabolic responses to repeated acute hypoxia in anaesthetised and surgically instrumented pigs. Methods: Under ketamine-midazolam anaesthesia, 15 pigs were surgically instrumented for measurements of cardiac output, vascular pressures and organ blood flows. Lactate production and O2 uptake were determined in the brain, liver, kidney and intestine. Ten animals were subjected to two 12-min periods of ventilatory hypoxia (FIO2=7%) followed by re-oxygenation and 5 animals underwent 120?min normoxic ventilation (Control group). Results: Both hypoxic challenges produced a comparable release of catecholamines that was associated with increased cardiac output and redistribution of blood flow away from the intestinal and renal areas towards the brain and the liver; O2 uptake was markedly reduced in the intestine (? 56 Â± 10%, P < 0.05) and least affected in the brain and the kidney (? 19Â±12% and ? 23Â±21%, respectively). During the second hypoxic test, lethal cardiovascular depression occurred in 5 animals; these non-survivors demonstrated impaired hyperdynamic response and incomplete recovery of intestinal O2 uptake during the first hypoxia/reoxygenation test. In the Control group, normoxic ventilation was not associated with significant haemodynamic and metabolic changes. Conclusion: Intraoperative hypoxia causes marked heterogeneity in organ blood flow and metabolism. The inability to develop a hyperdynamic cardiovascular response during a first hypoxic event, as well as a persistent intestinal O2 debt following re-oxygenation, predict the occurrence of death during the second hypoxic insult.

AB  - Abstract Conventional radiographs used for the management of endodontic problems yield limited information because of the two-dimensional nature of images produced, geometric distortion and anatomical noise. These factors often act in combination. This review paper assesses the limitations of periapical radiographs and seeks to clarify three-dimensional imaging techniques that have been suggested as adjuncts to conventional radiographs. These include tuned aperture computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, computed tomography and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). Of these techniques, CBCT appears to be an effective and safe way to overcome some of the problems associated with conventional radiographs.

AB  - Background:?? Parastomal hernias can be prevented or repaired using synthetic mesh; however, reported complications include infection, fibrosis and potential bowel erosion. The study aim was to assess the safety, feasibility and potential efficacy of using a prophylactic collagen implant. Methods:?? Twenty patients undergoing defunctioning stomas were randomised to a conventional procedure or reinforcement with the implant. Follow-up included regular symptom questionnaires, clinical examination, stoma site ultrasound, and serum inflammatory markers. Results:?? Ten patients (four males; mean BMI 26.3) had a conventional stoma, and ten (three males; mean BMI 26.3) received the implant. At a median of 6.5?months follow-up, a parastomal hernia was clinically evident in three of ten patients without the implant, and in none of ten patients with the implant. There were no clinical complications, ultrasound evidence of chronic seromas or serological evidence of a systemic inflammatory response. Conclusions:?? Xenogeneic collagen has been demonstrated to aid soft tissue reinforcement. In this study, in contrast to published data relating to the use of conventional synthetic mesh, there were no complications related to infection or the implant's proximity to the bowel. This trial demonstrates that the implant is safe, feasible to use and has the potential to prevent parastomal herniation.

AB  - Congenital limb deficiency defects (LDDs) are etiologically heterogeneous. Acquired causes include amniotic bands, teratogens exposure, and chorionic villus sampling before 10 weeks? gestation and intrinsic causes include single-gene disorders and chromosome abnormalities. However, a substantial number of cases, especially terminal transverse deficiency defects, occur without an obvious cause and are ascribed to vascular disruption events. Some studies have found an association between maternal thrombophilia and congenital LDDs. We investigated this association through a review of all prenatally identified LDDs at a major tertiary care center in Toronto, Canada over a 12-year period. Our results showed a higher prevalence of thrombophilias among women with a pregnancy affected with an LDD when compared to the general population [?2(3)?=?54.63, P?<?0.01]. Our research was strengthened by the inclusion of affected pregnancies regardless of outcome, and strict criteria to avoid including LDDs with a non-vascular etiology. Most LDDs were identified during the routine 18?20 week anatomy ultrasound, but some were discovered as early as 13 weeks? gestation. We found an excess of left-sided defects among terminal transverse but not longitudinal deficiencies; additionally, all diagnoses of maternal thrombophilia occurred in the terminal transverse group. Our results support thrombophilia screening in all women with a prenatally diagnosed fetal LDD as well as careful evaluation of the fetal extremities during prenatal ultrasounds in women with a known thrombophilia. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Real-time tissue elastography (RTE) can provide objective information associated with mechanical properties of tendon tissue and add value to the structural information obtained by greyscale ultrasound. Serial RTE assessment would be useful for monitoring and optimising safe rehabilitation for horses with tendon injury. Objectives To test the hypothesis that RTE could measure change in tissue stiffness in the healing process of injured superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) of horses. Study design Prospective field study. Methods Six Thoroughbred horses with SDFT injury and standardised rehabilitation were used. Both greyscale and RTE images were recorded approximately every 4 weeks up to 40 weeks from occurrence. Greyscale ratio (GR: dividing the grey-value of injured area by it of surrounding noninjured area) and strain ratio (SR: dividing the strain value of stand-off gel pad, which can be a standard, by it of injured area) was calculated at each examination. Tissue strain is displayed by colour which suggests hard (blue), intermediate (yellow), soft (red) on RTE image. Strain of injured area was evaluated by colour-scale grade (CSG) of 1 to 3 (1; blue to green, 2; yellow and 3; red) by 3 veterinarians who didn't know the case history. Results GR was returned to nearly 1 quickly within 8 weeks and it was unchanged thereafter. This continuous change of GR was best-fitted to logarithmic trendline (r2?=?0.66). SR increased gradually up to the last examination and was best-fitted to linear trendline (r2?=?0.89). CSG was decreased gradually and it was best-fitted to linear trendline (r2?=?0.84). Both change of SR and CSG suggested that an injured tissue would gradually increase in stiffness. Conclusions RTE could provide useful information regarding monitoring and optimising restoration of the tissue stiffness of tendon, even if GR was unchanged by progress of scar formation, for safer and more effective rehabilitation.

AB  - Summary The pressure within the abdominal cavity is normally little more than atmospheric pressure. However, even small increases in intra-abdominal pressure can have adverse effects on renal function, cardiac output, hepatic blood flow, respiratory mechanics, splanchnic perfusion and intracranial pressure. Although intra-abdominal pressure can be measured directly, this is invasive and bedside measurement of intra-abdominal pressure is usually achieved via the urinary bladder. This cheap, easy approach has been shown to produce results that correlate closely with directly measured abdominal pressures. Significant increases in intra-abdominal pressure are seen in a wide variety of conditions commonly encountered in the intensive care unit, such as ruptured aortic aneurysm, abdominal trauma and acute pancreatitis. Abdominal compartment syndrome describes the combination of increased intra-abdominal pressure and end-organ dysfunction. This syndrome has a high mortality, most deaths resulting from sepsis and multi-organ failure. Detection of abdominal compartment syndrome requires close surveillance of intra-abdominal pressure in patients thought to be at risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension. The only available treatment for established abdominal compartment syndrome is decompressive laparotomy. Prevention of abdominal compartment syndrome after laparotomy by adoption of an open abdomen approach may be preferable in the patient at significant risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension, but this has not been demonstrated in any large trials. Most surgeons prefer to adopt a ?wait and see? policy, only intervening when clinical deterioration is associated with a significant increase in intra-abdominal pressure.

AB  - Abstract Staging and therapeutic planning for dogs with malignant disease in the popliteal lymph node are based on the expected patterns of lymphatic drainage from the lymph node. The medial iliac lymph nodes are known to receive efferent lymph from the popliteal lymph node; however, an accessory popliteal efferent pathway with direct connection to the sacral lymph nodes has also been less frequently reported. The primary objective of this prospective, anatomic study was to describe the frequency of various patterns of lymphatic drainage of the popliteal lymph node. With informed client consent, 50 adult dogs with no known disease of the lymphatic system underwent computed tomographic lymphography after ultrasound-guided, percutaneous injection of 350Â mg/ml iohexol into a popliteal lymph node. In all 50 dogs, the popliteal lymph node drained directly to the ipsilateral medial iliac lymph node through multiple lymphatic vessels that coursed along the medial thigh. In 26% (13/50) of dogs, efferent vessels also drained from the popliteal lymph node directly to the internal iliac and/or sacral lymph nodes, coursing laterally through the gluteal region and passing over the dorsal aspect of the pelvis. Lymphatic connections between the right and left medial iliac and right and left internal iliac lymph nodes were found. Based on our findings, the internal iliac and sacral lymph nodes should be considered when staging or planning therapy for dogs with malignant disease in the popliteal lymph node.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis Estimate the incidence rate and provide basic descriptive epidemiologic characteristics of plunging ranulas in a multi-ethnic population. Study Design Case series with chart review. Methods The study group comprised all Counties Manukau Health (CMH, Manukau City, Auckland, New Zealand) patients presenting to the CMH Department of Otolaryngology with a diagnosis of plunging ranula from January 2001 to December 2013, as recorded in the departmental case register. Non-CMH domicile patients were excluded. South Auckland comprised the base population, as serviced by CMH. The 2006 New Zealand census data was used for population demographics. Results A total of 134 cases of plunging ranula were identified. The overall annual crude incidence rate was 2.4 per 100,000 person-years. The gender specific incidence rate for males was 3.2 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.5. 3.9) and for females was 2.0 per 100,000 (95% CI: 1.5, 2.6). The overall age-adjusted annual incidence rate was 2.6 per 100,000 (95% CI: 2.1, 3.0). The age-adjusted incidence was highest among Maori (6.7 per 100,000, 95% CI 4.9, 8.4), followed by Pacific Island (4.4 per 100,000, 95% CI 3.2, 5.6), Asian (0.7 per 100,000, 95% CI 0.2, 1.2), and European population (0.6 per 100,000, 95% CI 0.3, 0.8). Conclusion We have quantified for the first time the age-specific and age-adjusted incidence rates for plunging ranula by gender and ethnicity. The results show a likely underlying genetic predisposition for this condition, possibly with a superimposed environmental acquired factor relating to external, minor blunt trauma to the neck.

AB  - Abstract Current immunosuppression in VCA is largely based on the experience in solid organ transplantation. It remains unclear if steroids can be reduced safely in VCA recipients. We report on five VCA recipients who were weaned off maintenance steroids after a median of 2 months (mean: 4.8 months, range 2?12 months). Patients were kept subsequently on a low dose, dual maintenance consisting of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil/mycophenloic acid with a mean follow-up of 43.6 months (median?=?40 months, range 34?64 months). Early and late acute rejections responded well to temporarily augmented maintenance, topical immunosuppression, and/or steroid bolus treatment. One late steroid-resistant acute rejection required treatment with thymoglobulin. All patients have been gradually weaned off steroids subsequent to the treatment of acute rejections. Low levels of tacrolimus (<5?ng/mL) appeared as a risk for acute rejections. Although further experience and a cautious approach are warranted, dual-steroid free maintenance immunosuppression appears feasible in a series of five VCA recipients.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Historically, surgical intervention for liver trauma has been the accepted method of treatment with an associated high percentage of nontherapeutic laparotomies however, conservative management is now advocated in the haemodynamically stable patient. We report our experience of the management of patients admitted with liver trauma. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 75 patients admitted with liver trauma over a 9-year period (1992?2001). Fifty-eight were men (median age 25 years; range 1?76 years). Injury severity was determined using the hepatic injury scale (HIS). Results: Sixty-three patients were referred from other hospitals. Seventy-two patients suffered blunt trauma. Six patients were classified as grade 5 on the HIS, 43 as grade 4, 17 as grade 3, 8 as grade 2 and 1 as grade 1. Fifteen patients underwent surgery at the referring hospital, which involved perihepatic packing in 80 per cent. Of the 48 patients treated conservatively at the referring hospital, 43 were successfully treated with further conservative management. In total 23 patients required laparotomy in our unit, 18 for liver related injuries. Procedures included 3 hepatic resections and 13 for hepatorrhaphy. Median blood requirement in our unit was 2 units. Four patients developed definite biliary complications treated with endoscopic stenting in three cases and percutaneous drainage in one. A further five intra-abdominal collections required percutaneous drainage. The mortality rate was 8 per cent. Conclusion: The majority of patients with liver trauma can be successfully treated with conservative management. In unstable patients initial surgical packing and transfer to a specialist unit is recommended.

AB  - Summary Splenectomy is performed for primary or, less frequently, metastatic malignant tumors, spleen torsion, splenomegaly associated to infiltrative disease, traumatic rupture, and immune-mediated diseases. Splenectomy may be performed as 'open surgery' or laparoscopically. The most common early complication of splenectomy is hemorrhage, associated or not with hemostatic abnormalities. Early complications also include damage to the left pancreatic lobe and gastric wall because of devascularization and acute infection. Arrhythmias are abnormal rhythms of the heart, causing a less effective cardiac output. Arrhythmias, usually in form of rapid ventricular tachycardia or multifocal ventricular arrhythmia, are reported in dogs undergoing splenectomy for malignant tumors, torsion, and benign splenomegaly. Continuous monitoring is acceptable when neither significant pulse deficit nor clinical signs are evident. Only symptomatic dogs with no perceptible femoral pulse, multifocal ventricular arrhythmia or tachycardia, and hypoperfusion or preexisting cardiac disease should receive medical therapy.

AB  - Objective To evaluate mid-term radiographic and functional outcomes of tibial plateau fracture (TPF) patients treated with the open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) technique and to find predictive factors of clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective, single-center study was performed enrolling a consecutive series of patients with diagnosis of TPF. All subjects were treated by ORIF between January 2010 and December 2015 at our level-1 healthcare trauma center. The inclusion criteria were: age between 18 and 75?years; ORIF technique used for articular TPF, type 41-B and 41-C, isolated or with associated injuries. The patients were divided in two groups, according to fracture patterns and compared. Their characteristics, radiographic and clinical outcomes were recorded. Radiographs 12?months after surgery were evaluated for reduction and alignment, and radiographs at 24?months to describe post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Functional outcomes were assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS), the Short Form 36 (SF-36), the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS), and the American Knee Society score (AKSS) questionnaires. Return to work and sport activities were also investigated. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed, and the statistical significance was defined as two-tailed P <?0.05. Results Forty-five patients were included, 29 males and 16 females; the mean age was 54.5?years. The mean follow-up was 57.18?months (range, 26?94). There were AO 41-B fractures (partial articular fractures) in more than half of the patients (66.67%), while the remaining 15 had AO 41-C fractures (complete articular fractures). The sub-type AO 41-B3 was the most common, reported in 62.22% of patients. The mean KOOS score was 69.0. Mean AKSS and SF-36 PCS scores were 79.0 and 41.4, respectively. There were significant relationships between age and functional results (KOOS ADL, Sport, QoL, and SF-36 PCS) and between BMI and KOOS Pain, ADL, Sport, and QoL. No differences were found between the two types of fractures regarding quality of reduction and alignment. AO 41-C TPF tend to develop PTOA more frequently with respect to 41-B fractures, while type AO 41-C TPF had the worst clinical outcomes. We found that the presence of an articular step-off and the malalignment of the tibial axis after surgery were predictive of daily pain felt by patients. PTOA was predictive of a worse AKSS. The overall complication rate was 13.33%: 1 superficial wound infection, 1 deep vein thrombosis, and 4 cases of transitory deficit of the common peroneal nerve. Conclusion The present study demonstrates that early radiographic features may be predictive for pain perceived by patients at mid-term follow-up.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? A decline in sexual activity has been reported as women age. Aim.? To compare, in young adult and middle-aged women, the clitoral volumetric and vascular modifications during the periovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle, and to analyze their relationship with circulating hormones, nitric oxide levels, and with questionnaires on sexuality, relationship, and depression. Methods.? Fifteen young (18?25 years; Group I), and 16 middle-aged (35?45 years; Group II) eumenorrheic women were submitted, on day 14 of their menstrual cycle, to utero-ovarian and clitoral ultrasonographic analysis, and to color Doppler evaluation of the uterine and dorsal clitoral arteries. On the same day, hormonal parameters and plasma concentrations of nitrites/nitrates were assayed, and the two-factor Italian McCoy female questionnaire and the Beck's Depression Inventory questionnaire were administered. Main Outcomes Measures.? Utero-ovarian and clitoral ultrasonographic analysis, color Doppler evaluation of the uterine and dorsal clitoral arteries; evaluation of hormonal and nitrites/nitrates plasma concentrations; administration of the two-factor Italian McCoy Female Sexuality Questionnaire and the Beck's Depression Inventory questionnaire. Results.? The plasma levels of estradiol, testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, and nitrites/nitrates were similar in both groups. Neither the ultrasonographic assessment of the clitoral body volume (0.82?Â±?0.24?mL vs. 0.73?Â±?0.26?mL) nor the Doppler analysis of the dorsal clitoral artery [pulsatility index (PI)?=?1.35?Â±?0.31 vs. PI?=?1.36?Â±?0.19] evidenced any significant differences in either Group I or Group II. The two-factor Italian McCoy Female Sexuality Questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory questionnaire gave the same results in Group I and Group II. The relationship between the different parameters evidenced that the NO2?/NO3? circulating levels are inversely correlated with uterine artery (r?=??0.4611; P?=?0.008) and dorsal clitoral artery (r?=??0.331; P?=?0.041) PIs. Furthermore, estradiol resulted inversely correlated with depression (r?=??0.332; P?=?0.045). The two sections (sexuality and partnership) of Italian McCoy Female Sexuality Questionnaire were positively correlated (r?=?0.849; P?<?0.0001) between each other. Conclusions.? In eumenorrheic young adult and middle-aged women, the periovulatory clitoral anatomic and vascular modifications similarly occur.
