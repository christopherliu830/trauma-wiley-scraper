AB  - Summary Pain management in small infants and children is challenging. We report the use of unilateral transversus abdominis plane (TAP) catheters for analgesia following single-sided open lower abdominal surgery when epidural analgesia was undesirable in a series of six low-weight children. Data collection was done via a retrospective chart review. All catheters attempted were successfully placed with resultant low pain scores and the minimal use of rescue analgesic medications. No complications were reported related to these catheters. TAP catheters, although technically challenging, are feasible for the provision of analgesia for surgeries involving the lower abdominal wall in very small patients.

AB  - Intrathoracic liposarcoma can occur in the lung, mediastinum, pleura, and chest wall, and tends to remain clinically silent until becoming large enough to displace adjacent structures. Treatment usually includes sufficient surgical resection followed when necessary by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. We report a case of an uncommon presentation of a rapidly growing pleural liposarcoma, the diagnosis of which may have been obscured by coexisting thoracic trauma with suspected extrapleural hematoma.

AB  - Aims:? To determine the immediate and long-term results of endoscopic drainage and necrosectomy for symptomatic pancreatic fluid collections. Methods:? The data of 80 patients with symptomatic pancreatic fluid collections (mean diameter: 11.7?cm, range 3?20; pseudocysts: 24/80, abscess: 20/80, infected walled-off necrosis: 36/80) referred for endoscopic management from October 1997 to March 2008 were analyzed retrospectively. Results:? Endoscopic drainage techniques included endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided aspiration (2/80), EUS-guided transenteric drainage (70/80) and non-EUS-guided drainage across a spontaneous transenteric fistula (8/80). Endoscopic necrosectomy was carried out in 49/80 (abscesses: 14/20; infected necrosis: 35/36). Procedural complications were bleeding (12/80), perforation (7/80), portal air embolism (1/80) and Ogilvie Syndrome (1/80). Initial technical success was achieved in 78/80 (97.5%) and clinical resolution of the collections was achieved endoscopically in 67/80 (83.8%), with surgery required in 13/80 (perforation: four; endoscopically inaccessible areas: two; inadequate drainage: seven). Within 6?months five patients required surgery due to recurrent fluid collections; over a mean follow up of 31?months, surgery was required in four more patients due to recurrent collections as a consequence of underlying pancreatic duct abnormalities that could not be treated endoscopically. The long-term success of endoscopic treatment was 58/80 (72.5%). Conclusions:? Endoscopic drainage of symptomatic pancreatic fluid collections is safe and effective, with excellent immediate and long-term results. Endoscopic necrosectomy has a risk of serious complications. The underlying pancreatic duct abnormalities must be addressed to prevent recurrence of fluid collections.

AB  - We studied the value of dynamic sonography in adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder joint in patients with clinically suspected frozen shoulder. The sonographic criterion of adhesive capsulitis was continuous limitation of the sliding movement of the supraspinatus tendon against the acromion of the scapula. Arthrography was regarded as a gold standard in the diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis against which the sonographic results were compared. Among 23 patients with arthrographically documented adhesive capsulitis, sonographic examination showed limitation of movement of the supraspinatus tendon in 21. This sonographic sign therefore has a sensitivity of 91%, a specificity of 100%, and an accuracy of 92% for detecting adhesive capsulitis, making dynamic sonography a reliable technique for the diagnosis of this condition.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the perioperative findings and outcome of dogs undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for the management of pyothorax. Design Multi-institutional, retrospective study. Animals Client-owned dogs (n?=?14). Methods Medical records of dogs with pyothorax managed via VATS were reviewed for signalment, history, clinical signs, clinicopathological findings, diagnostic imaging results, surgical variables, bacterial culture and sensitivity results, post-operative management and outcome. VATS was performed after placing a paraxyphoid endoscopic portal and 2-3 intercostal instrument portals. VATS exploration was followed by one or more of the following: mediastinal debridement, tissue sampling, pleural lavage, and placement of a thoracostomy tube. Results Two dogs (14%) required conversion from VATS to an open thoracotomy to completely resect proliferative mediastinal tissue. These dogs had severe pleural effusion on preoperative thoracic radiographs and one had severely thickened contrast-enhancing mediastinum on preoperative computed tomography (CT). The cause of pyothorax was identified as a penetrating gastric foreign body (n?=?2), migrating plant material (n?=?2), and idiopathic (n?=?10). The median follow-up time was 143 days (range, 14-2402 days). All dogs were discharged from the hospital and their clinical signs resolved. One patient had recurrence of a pyothorax requiring revision surgery 17 months postoperatively. Conclusion VATS allows minimally invasive treatment of uncomplicated canine pyothorax. Preoperative thoracic CT may help identify candidates for VATS among dogs with pyothorax.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? The vaginal orgasm seems to be evocated by the stimulation of the G-spot: a highly sensitive area on the anterior wall of the human vagina. However, the existence of such a spot is controversial. Aim.? To evaluate, by the use of three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasonography, the anatomic structures of the urethrovaginal space both in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients and eumenorrheic non-hirsute controls. Methods.? Twenty-three (Group I) PCOS patients and 25 eumenorrheic young women (Group II) were submitted to two-dimensional (2-D) and 3-D ultrasonography and color Doppler analysis of the urethrovaginal space and of the clitoris. Main Outcome Measures.? 2-D ultrasonographic evaluation of the ovaries and of the urethrovaginal space; color Doppler evaluation of the ovarian stromal arteries, urethrovaginal main feeding artery, and dorsal clitoral arteries; 3-D volume calculation of the urethrovaginal space, and 3-D power Doppler analysis of the vascularization index; flow index; and vascularization flow index; hormonal evaluation. Results.? The vaginal orgasm was present in 13/23 (56%) patients in PCOS Group and in 13/25 (52%) in the controls. The 3-D reconstruction of the urethrovaginal space demonstrated a gland-like aspect with small feeding vessels: ?female prostate.? The 3-D mean volume of the ?female prostate? was significantly higher in Group I (0.48?±?0.21?mL) than in Group II (0.39?±?0.19?mL; P?=?0.044). The Virtual Organ Computer-aided AnaLys (VOCAL) built mean volume of the ?female prostate? was positively correlated with the time since intercourse (r?=?0.486; P?=?0.032), with the total length of the urethrovaginal space (r?=?0.616; P?=?0.025) and with the testosterone (r?=?0.424; P?=?0.048) circulating values. Conclusions.? The presence of the G-spot and its role in vaginal orgasm remains controversial. In Italians, and normal weight PCOS patients the hyperandrogenism seems to result in ovarian stromal and ?female prostate? hyperplasia.

AB  - This paper describes three cases of liver lobe torsion in rabbits presenting with anorexia, lethargy, jaundice and abdominal pain. This condition was associated with anaemia and elevation of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Abnormal radiological findings included hepatomegaly, gas-filled intestinal loops consistent with gastrointestinal ileus and ascites. Ultrasonographic findings included heterogeneous liver parenchyma, free abdominal fluid and reduced bowel motility. Diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination of the liver in all three cases.

AB  - Summary A 17-year-old Irish Sport Horse gelding was referred to the University College Dublin Veterinary Hospital for low-grade colic that had been nonresponsive to medical treatment. Diagnostic investigation revealed a marked septic peritonitis. The inciting cause was detected by gastroscopy to be a perforating foreign body in the pylorus of the stomach from a briar of a blackthorn plant (Prunus spinosa spp.). Successful removal of the foreign body was achieved surgically via gastrotomy. The horse subsequently developed a multi-drug resistant abdominal incision site infection, which was successfully managed over a 2-month period. Abdominal incisional herniation occurred thereafter. Six months post-operatively, the horse was back in light work and no further adverse sequelae had been noted.

AB  - Objective To report clinical findings, perioperative complications and long-term outcome in dogs and cats that had hemipelvectomy surgery for treatment of neoplasia. Study Design Multi-institutional retrospective case series. Animals Dogs (n?=?84) and cats (16). Methods Medical records (January 2000 to December 2009) of dogs and cats that had hemipelvectomy at participating institutions were reviewed. Postoperative progress and current status of the patient at the time of the study was determined by either medical record review, or via telephone contact with the referring veterinarian or owner. Results Complications were infrequent and usually minor. Hemorrhage was the main intraoperative complication; 2 dogs required blood transfusion. One dog developed an incisional hernia. In dogs, hemangiosarcoma had the worst prognosis with a median survival time (MST) of 179 days. MST for chondrosarcoma (1232 days), osteosarcoma (533 days), and soft tissue sarcoma (373 days) were not statistically different. Median disease-free interval (DFI) for local recurrence of all tumor types was 257 days. Cats had 75% survival at 1 year, which was significantly longer than dogs. Conclusions Survival times for most tumor types can be good, but surgical margins should be carefully evaluated to ensure complete tumor removal. Adjuvant therapies may be advisable particularly for dogs to reduce rates of local recurrence or distant metastasis.

AB  - Summary Endovascular therapy is an important and expanding treatment option for peripheral vascular disease resulting in chronic limb ischaemia. It has the advantage of being minimally invasive with rapid patient recovery, but is limited by the requirement for sophisticated imaging systems using diagnostic radiation and expensive disposables. Recurrence of arterial disease is also more common than with conventional surgery and secondary intervention rates are high. Endovascular techniques have revolutionised the management of abdominal aortic aneurysms and some thoracic aortic aneurysms by allowing percutaneous image-guided repair; similar techniques can be used in the management of aortic trauma and dissection. Other important applications of endovascular therapy include its role in the management of acute limb ischaemia with thrombolysis and thrombectomy and in controlling haemorrhage both traumatic and non-traumatic in aetiology.

AB  - Lymphoma is reported to be the most common nasal and second most common intracranial neoplasm in cats. Intracranial lymphoma may occur as a primary central nervous system lymphoma or as part of multi-centric disease. Two cats were presented with histopathologically confirmed nasopharyngeal lymphoma and concurrent mass within the middle fossa of the cranial cavity, with magnetic resonance imaging suggestive of direct communication. Both cats demonstrated evidence of bilateral oculomotor nerve deficits and upper respiratory tract noise. In one cat, bilateral optic nerve deficits were also present. The magnetic resonance imaging features were similar in both cases and demonstrated a contrast-enhancing intracranial mass on the ventral aspect of the middle fossa of the cranial cavity and an adjacent mass arising from the dorsal aspect of the nasopharynx. Lymphoma should be included as an important differential diagnosis in cats presented with middle cranial fossa syndrome (in particular ophthalmoplegia) and stertor.
