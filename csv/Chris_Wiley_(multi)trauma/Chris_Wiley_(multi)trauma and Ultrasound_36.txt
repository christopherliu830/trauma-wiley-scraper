AB  - Abstract Allogeneic portal vein (PV) grafts have been widely used for vascular reconstruction in the aggressive biliary-pancreatic surgery and partial liver transplantation. We developed a novel PV transplantation model aimed at studying the pathologic alteration of the grafts and further managements. The PV graft was implanted orthotopically into the recipient using two-cuff technique. A total of 80 PV transplants have been performed, and the overall survival rate for the recipients was 91.3% (73/80). Mice were randomly separated into isografts group, allografts group, and allografts group treated with CTLA4-Ig. PV grafts were harvested on the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 8th postoperative week. The isografts remained intact vascular structure, and the allografts developed marked rejection with significant increase in wall thickness (95 ± 19 ?m vs. 49 ± 7 ?m; P < 0.01) and decrease in lumen area (1.9 ± 1.1 ? 104 ?m2 vs. 7.7 ± 3.1 ? 104 ?m2; P < 0.01) on the 4th week. In the CTLA4-Ig treated group, the vascular thickness and lumen area were significantly improved when compared with the untreated allografts (wall-thickness: 53 ± 3 ?m vs. 95 ± 19 ?m, P < 0.01; lumen area: 8.8 ± 2.4 ? 104 ?m2 vs. 1.9 ± 1.1 ? 104 ?m2, P < 0.01) on the 4th week. In conclusion, the PV transplantation model in mice using two-cuff technique is a feasible procedure with a high survival rate. The PV allografts responded well to the CTLA4-Ig therapy in our preliminary research by the model. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Microsurgery, 2007.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Thrombosis of the pancreas after transplantation is the most common cause of relaparotomy and resultant graft loss. There is currently no standard protocol consistently proven to prevent thrombosis following transplantation. Our objective was to determine whether our protocol of post-operative low-dose intravenous (IV) heparin infusion would prevent graft thrombosis without additional complications in our patients. Methods A total of 66 simultaneous pancreas kidney (SPK) transplants were performed at our institution from 2004 to 2014. Patients were divided into 2 retrospective cohort groups. Group 1 patients received only acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 81 mg/d started on post-operative day 1. Group 2 patients received IV heparin infusion beginning in the recovery room at a rate of 500 IU/h for the first 24 hours, reduced by 100 IU/h every day to stop on day 5, and then received ASA 81 mg/d afterward. Outcome and complication rates were compared between the two groups for 5 years post-transplant. Results We observed a significant reduction in graft thrombosis and graft loss with (0/29) patients in the heparin group vs (7/33) 25.7% from the non-heparin (P<.01) with no differences in complication rates. Conclusions We present a heparin infusion protocol which may help prevent graft thrombosis and graft loss in SPK transplantation.

AB  - Background? The epidemiology of post-injury multiple organ failure (MOF) is reported to go through changes during the last 15 years. The purpose of this study is to describe the epidemiology of post-injury MOF in Australia. Methods? A 12-month prospective epidemiological study was performed in a Major Trauma Service. Demographics, injury severity (ISS), physiological, MOF status and outcome data was prospectively collected on all trauma patients who met inclusion criteria (ICU admission; ISS?>?15; age?>?18, AIS head <3 and survival >48?hrs). MOF was defined by the Denver MOF score. Data are presented as % or Mean+/?SEM. Univariate statistical comparison was performed (Student t- and X-square tests), p?<?0.05 was considered significant. Results? Twenty-five patients met inclusion criteria (Age 39+/?5, ISS 27+/?3, Male 60%), three patients (12%) developed MOF. The maximum MOF score was 5.7 +/?1, with duration of 2.3+/?0.7 days. Two patients had respiratory and cardiac failure, while one patient had failure of respiratory, cardiac, hepatic and renal systems. All MOF patients survived. MOF patients tend to have longer ICU stays (18+/?5.5 vs 7+/?0.8 p?=?0.17), were older (54+/?17 vs 38+/?5 p?=?0.4). None of the previously described independent predictors (ISS, base deficit, lactate, transfusions) were different when the MOF patients were compared with the non-MOF patients. Conclusion? MOF is not as significant a cause of late trauma death as previously reported internationally. Our preliminary data challenges the timeliness of the 10-year-old independent predictors of post-injury MOF. The epidemiology, the clinical presentation and the independent predictors of post-injury MOF requires reassessment for the Australian context.

AB  - A three-year-old male neutered domestic shorthair cat was presented for loss of vision associated with hyperthermia, lethargy and anorexia. Ophthalmic examination revealed a bilateral panuveitis. Cytological examination of aqueous and vitreous humours was performed and revealed a suppurative inflammation associated with numerous cocci. Enterococcus faecalis was identified by bacterial culture from aqueous and vitreous humour. No primary infection site was identified. Active uveitis resolved after systemic antibiotic therapy, but the vision loss was permanent. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first reported case of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis secondary to E. faecalis infection in a cat.

AB  - A 62-year-old woman presented with a hard, well circumscribed, painless breast lump of 2?weeks duration. Past history showed an episode of deep vein thrombosis 6?weeks earlier, for which she was on warfarin. Mammogram, ultrasound and needle biopsy confirmed spontaneous haemorrhagic necrosis of breast tissue, a rare site for spontaneous bleeding for patients on anticoagulants. Though concurrent use of warfarin or heparin is generally considered a contraindication to carrying out core breast biopsy, recent evidence suggests it is unnecessary to discontinue anticoagulants in patients undergoing such procedures, which is crucial in ruling out incidental malignancy, especially in elderly patients.

AB  - Summary Elderly patients with hip fracture experience high morbidity and mortality, and are often undertreated for pain. Acute pain management in the elderly is challenging, with physiological frailty, medical comorbidities and cognitive impairment commonly compounding pain assessment and treatment. Guidelines outlining current best practice for acute pain management in the elderly now exist, but evidence suggests that practice remains variable and there continues to be scope for improvement. We conducted a narrative review of the literature to examine the challenges of acute pain management in the elderly, and to evaluate evidence for the role of regional nerve blocks for acute pain associated with hip fracture in the elderly. There is consistent evidence that regional nerve blocks can effectively reduce pain associated with hip fracture, providing rapid-onset, site-specific analgesia that is more effective than standard systemic analgesia alone. There is also moderate evidence that nerve blocks may contribute to reduced rates of delirium, and some suggestion of reduced length of inpatient stay, morbidity and mortality, although limited evidence is available. Fascia iliaca blocks are emerging as a block of choice, with evidence they can be safely and rapidly administered under ultrasound guidance in the acute setting, by both trained medical and nursing staff, with good effect. Ideally, comprehensive pain protocols for elderly hip fracture patients are required, that integrate evidence-based fascia iliaca block use, timely and repeated pain assessment, and multidisciplinary orthogeriatric patient care.

AB  - Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common genetic renal disease in adults, affecting one in every 1000 Australians. It is caused by loss-of-function heterozygous mutations in either PKD1 or PKD2 , which encode the proteins, polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 respectively. The disease hallmark is the development of hundreds of microscopic fluid-filled cysts in the kidney during early childhood, which grow exponentially and continuously through life at varying rates (between 2% and 10% per year), causing loss of normal renal tissue and up to a 50% lifetime risk of dialysis-dependent kidney failure. Other systemic complications include hypertensive cardiac disease, hepatic cysts, intracranial aneurysms, diverticular disease and hernias. Over the last two decades, advances in the genetics and pathogenesis of this disease have led to novel treatments that reduce the rate of renal cyst growth and may potentially delay the onset of kidney failure. New evidence indicates that conventional therapies (such as angiotensin inhibitors and statins) have mild attenuating effects on renal cyst growth and that systemic levels of vasopressin are critical for promoting renal cyst growth in the postnatal period. Identifying and integrating patient-centred perspectives in clinical trials is also being advocated. This review will provide an update on recent advances in the clinical management of ADPKD.

CODE 75: Operative protocols and a case report in preventive dental care in a department of neurorehabilitation for acquired cerebral lesions. Abstract:? CODE 75 is a neurorehabilitation department at the General Hospital of Versilia, which specializes in serious acquired cerebral lesions. Objectives:? The therapy and the maintenance of oral hygiene in patients with cerebral lesions are critical to the overall success of the rehabilitation therapy. The purpose of our project was to improve patients? quality of life, reducing the quantity of oral bacteria caused by the presence of layers of plaque on the tooth surfaces and in the oral mucosa. Methods:? The dental department of Versilia Hospital conducted a 1?year follow-up study to develop specific protocols designed to obtain and improve the maintenance of these patients? oral hygiene. The oral prevention project was directed primarily at the department?s medical staff and carers, and focused on improving the information available to the medical team and their direct involvement. A case report is described to show an application of the protocol. Data were recorded before the start of the protocol (T0) and after 1?month (T1). Results:? The analysis of the periodontal parameters shows a difference in values between T0 and T1. In T1 no bleeding on probing was recorded. After the causal therapy, the gingival hypertrophy and oedema disappeared as confirmed by the absence of BOP. Discussions:? Results show that teamwork plays a fundamental role in this multi-professional approach for the rehabilitation of patients with acquired cerebral lesions. The success of this protocol depends on the cooperation between personnel with specific skills in the department.

AB  - Summary Transdermal drug delivery across the highly lipophilic uppermost layer of the skin, the stratum corneum, is highly challenging. Importantly, permeation of hydrophilic small or high molecular weight and charged compounds into the systemic circulation is limited. To successfully deliver hydrophilic drugs, and macromolecular agents of interest, including peptides, DNA and small interfering RNA, many research groups and pharmaceutical companies worldwide are focusing on the use of microporation-based enhancing techniques. These techniques include the use of laser, thermal ablation, electroporation, radiofrequency, ultrasound, high-pressure jets, and microneedle technology. All of these share the common goal of enhancing the permeability of a biological membrane through the creation of transient aqueous transport pathways of micron dimensions across that membrane. Once created, these micropores are orders of magnitude larger than molecular dimensions, and therefore should readily permit the transport of hydrophilic macromolecules. Additionally, microporation devices also enable minimally invasive sampling and monitoring of biological fluids. This Chapter deals with the innovations relating to microporation based methods and devices for transdermal drug delivery and minimally invasive monitoring.

AB  - Objectives: The objectives of the study were (1) to report the incidence of Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia in a normal French cavalier King Charles spaniel breeding population; (2) to precise the standard computed tomography dimensions of the caudal fossa and (3) to investigate the use of ultrasonography in diagnosis of this syndrome. Methods: Clinically normal adult cavalier King Charles spaniel underwent ultrasonographic examination of the spinal cord and caudal fossa. Computed tomography was used to measure the caudal fossa and magnetic resonance imaging allowed syringomyelia and cerebellar herniation identification. Results: Of the 16 dogs in the study, seven had syringomyelia (43·7 per cent). All dogs had cerebellar herniation, suggesting Chiari-like malformation and also a tendency to occipital dysplasia. Computed tomography measurements of the caudal fossa are reported. In one dog, a syrinx was identified by ultrasonography. The only difference between dogs with or without syringomyelia was that dogs with Chiari-like malformation/syringomyelia were statistically older. Clinical Significance: The incidence of Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia may be high in an asymptomatic population of cavalier King Charles spaniel . Computed tomography measurements reported in this study should now be compared with those of a symptomatic population to evaluate the hypothesis that dogs with Chiari-like malformation/syringomyelia syndrome have a smaller caudal fossa. This study did not identify a smaller caudal fossa in an asymptomatic cavalier King Charles spaniel population with syringomyelia. Ultrasonography probably has a low sensitivity for diagnosis of Chiari-like malformation/syringomyelia.

AB  - Background Liver abscess is a serious disease traditionally managed by open drainage. The advances in interventional radiology over the last two decades have allowed a change in approach to this condition. We have reviewed our experience in managing liver abscess over the last 7 years. Methods Details of all patients admitted with liver abscess between 1995 and 2002 were prospectively entered onto our database. A review was performed to document the use of imaging and drainage techniques. Aetiology, morbidity, mortality and duration of hospital stay were recorded. Results Forty-two patients (median age 53 [22-85] years; M:F 18:24) were admitted with liver abscess (multiple abscess 20); 19 cases were of portal tract origin, 16 cases were of biliary tract origin and 7 cases were spontaneous. Forty-one patients were managed non-operatively, all received antibiotics (cephalosporins 76%, metronidazole 88%, quinolones 33%). Diagnosis was made on ultrasound scan (22) or CT (20). Five patients were managed with antibiotics alone. Fifteen patients were managed initially with percutaneous aspiration and five subsequently required percutaneous drainage. Twenty-one patients had primary percutaneous drainage, nine requiring a further procedure (aspiration 3, drainage 6). One patient underwent hepatic resection. Median hospital stay was 16 (6?35) days. There was one death, but no procedure-related morbidity. Discussion Non-operative management of solitary and multiple liver abscesses is safe and effective.

AB  - Summary Preterm labour is a syndrome with multiple aetiologies and is the leading cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity. The risk of preterm labour can be predicted from past history, ultrasound measurement of cervical length and detection of fibronectin in cervicovaginal secretions. Cervical cerclage may reduce the risk in highly selected cases. Progesterone reduces the risk in women at high risk and tocolytic drugs may delay birth in a minority of women with genuine contractions, but neonatal benefit is not proven with either treatment.

AB  - Summary Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) affects an estimated 98,400 individuals in the UK, including 21900 who are infected but remain undiagnosed (1). The prevalence of HIV is increasing worldwide, in part due to ongoing transmission and more widespread testing, but also as a consequence of the improved life expectancy which highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has brought. Despite the dramatic reduction in the overall incidence of opportunistic infections in the post-HAART era, there is still significant morbidity and mortality associated with late diagnosis. Late diagnosis (defined as CD4 count <350 cells/mm3 at diagnosis) accounts for approximately 50% of new diagnosis in UK and Europe (1). Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are extremely common amongst individuals living with HIV - the reasons for which are likely to be multi-factorial. Patients may experience GI side effects as a result of antiretroviral therapy or other drugs used to treat HIV-related complications. They may develop opportunistic infections affecting any part of the GI tract from mouth to anus, related to their degree of immuno-compromise. Finally, their epidemiological risk group may place them at increased risk of certain diseases e.g. viral hepatitis in injecting drug users, lymphogranuloma venereum in men having sex with men (MSM). It is therefore important for GI physicians to have an awareness of the various manifestations of GI disease in HIV positive patients in order to help formulate a differential diagnosis and guide investigation in those with known infection (Table 1). Recognizing the association between specific conditions and HIV/AIDS may prompt testing by GI physicians and provide a valuable opportunity to diagnose HIV earlier resulting in better clinical outcome.

AB  - Objective To assess the outcome of canine splenic lymphoma treated with splenectomy and to evaluate prognostic factors, including involvement of other sites, adjuvant chemotherapy, and the effect of World Health Organization (WHO) histological classification of canine malignant lymphoma. Design Multi-institutional, retrospective study. Animals Client-owned dogs (n?=?28). Methods Medical records (1995?2011) of dogs with a histological diagnosis of splenic lymphoma and treated by splenectomy submitted by Veterinary Society of Surgical Oncology members were reviewed. Included were dogs treated with or without adjuvant therapy. Overall survival, disease-free interval, and cause of death were determined. Prognostic factors and the WHO histological classification of canine malignant lymphoma were evaluated with respect to outcome. Results Dogs with splenic lymphoma treated by splenectomy had a 1-year survival rate of 58.8%, after which no animals died of their disease. B cell lymphoma held a better prognosis for survival than other variants of splenic lymphoma. Marginal zone lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma were the most common B cell lymphoma subtypes in our study. Hemoabdomen and clinical signs related to splenic lymphoma, including abdominal distention, lethargy, and anorexia, were poor prognostic indicators, whereas disease confined to the spleen was a positive prognostic indicator. Pre- or postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy did not provide a survival benefit. Conclusion Based on our sample population, splenectomy alone was an effective treatment for splenic lymphoma in cases with disease confined to the spleen. Chemotherapy may not improve survival in cases of lymphoma restricted to the spleen.

AB  - Abstract Objective Abdominal pain is a common paediatric presentation to the ED. Accurate diagnosis of acute appendicitis is challenging, with the best-performing clinical scoring systems having sensitivities between 72% and 100%. The aim of this study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of clinician gestalt according to seniority in diagnosing paediatric acute appendicitis in ED. Methods This is a prospective multi-centre observational study of clinician's prediction of appendicitis in children under the age of 16?years presenting to four EDs with abdominal pain over a 1 month period at each site. Clinician-estimated likelihood of acute appendicitis was compared with the final diagnosis determined by histopathology or operative findings and supplemented by telephone follow up for those without an operation. The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy of clinician gestalt according to clinician seniority in diagnosing appendicitis. Results There were 381 children enrolled with completed clinician questionnaires, and 224 children had complete follow up or underwent appendicectomy. The median age was 9 years (interquartile range 6?12) and the incidence of appendicitis was 31/224 (13.8%, 95% confidence interval 9.3?18.4). The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of clinician gestalt were 0.84 (0.76?0.91), 81% (63?93%), 76% (69?82%), 35% (28?42%) and 96% (92?98%), respectively, giving an overall diagnostic accuracy of 76% (70?82%). AUC stratified by clinician seniority (junior, intermediate and senior) were 0.89 (0.80?0.98), 0.82 (0.69?0.95) and 0.76 (0.56?0.96), respectively. Conclusions The diagnostic accuracy of ED clinician gestalt in paediatric appendicitis is comparable to current clinical scoring systems irrespective of seniority.
