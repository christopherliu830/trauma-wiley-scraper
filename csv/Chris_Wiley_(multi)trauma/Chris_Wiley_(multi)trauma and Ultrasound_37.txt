AB  - Injections into the intraarticular sacroiliac joint (SIJ) are commonly done for both diagnostic and therapeutic reasons. Injection of an anesthetic can aid in the diagnosis of SIJ pain. Corticosteroids can be administered with the goal of providing a therapeutic effect. This article summarizes the literature regarding the diagnostic and therapeutic effects of these injections. It includes a review of the various imaging modalities including fluoroscopy, ultrasound, and computed tomography guidance, as well as a discussion on the prevalence data and other variables that may affect the reported outcomes.

AB  - Objective To assess the outcome of canine splenic lymphoma treated with splenectomy and to evaluate prognostic factors, including involvement of other sites, adjuvant chemotherapy, and the effect of World Health Organization (WHO) histological classification of canine malignant lymphoma. Design Multi-institutional, retrospective study. Animals Client-owned dogs (n?=?28). Methods Medical records (1995?2011) of dogs with a histological diagnosis of splenic lymphoma and treated by splenectomy submitted by Veterinary Society of Surgical Oncology members were reviewed. Included were dogs treated with or without adjuvant therapy. Overall survival, disease-free interval, and cause of death were determined. Prognostic factors and the WHO histological classification of canine malignant lymphoma were evaluated with respect to outcome. Results Dogs with splenic lymphoma treated by splenectomy had a 1-year survival rate of 58.8%, after which no animals died of their disease. B cell lymphoma held a better prognosis for survival than other variants of splenic lymphoma. Marginal zone lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma were the most common B cell lymphoma subtypes in our study. Hemoabdomen and clinical signs related to splenic lymphoma, including abdominal distention, lethargy, and anorexia, were poor prognostic indicators, whereas disease confined to the spleen was a positive prognostic indicator. Pre- or postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy did not provide a survival benefit. Conclusion Based on our sample population, splenectomy alone was an effective treatment for splenic lymphoma in cases with disease confined to the spleen. Chemotherapy may not improve survival in cases of lymphoma restricted to the spleen.

AB  - Mitral regurgitation (MR) related to chronic degenerative valvular disease is the most important cause of heart failure in dogs. Ultrasound examination of the heart can identify valve lesions, confirm the presence of valvular regurgitation, document cardiac remodeling, estimate intracardiac pressures, and quantify systolic ventricular function. These findings can influence prognosis or selection of medical therapy. Reductions in ventricular systolic function may be detected on serial echocardiographic examinations in some dogs with MR. However the changes in ventricular loading that accompany MR often complicate these measurements. For example, shortening and ejection fractions are often increased in severe MR, even in the setting of congestive heart failure. Echocardiography with Doppler is also used to assess ventricular diastolic function and filling pressures. This information helps predict the risk of congestive heart failure. However these findings are often rendered ambiguous by age-related impairment of ventricular relaxation, elevations in left atrial pressure due to MR, and effects of volume overload on myocardial tissue velocities. These factors limit the usefulness of ventricular filling and tissue velocities, as well as derived ratios such as the E/E' ratio, for predicting congestive heart failure in MR. More advanced Doppler and tissue echocardiographic methods, as well as prospective clinical studies, are needed to reduce the ambiguity involved with assessment of ventricular function and filling pressures in the setting of MR.

AB  - Abstract Aim It has been reported that advancing age causes tendons to become more compliant and fascicles length shorter. This could then lead to enhancement of movement efficiency provided that the elderly adults can activate their muscles in the same way as the younger adults (YOUNG) during dynamic movements. This study was designed to examine the age-specific behaviour of the medial gastrocnemius (MG) fascicles and tendinous tissues together with lower-leg muscle activities when the well-trained elderly runners ran on the treadmill at preferred speeds. Methods The well-trained 11 elderly subjects (ELD) who have running experiences and 11 YOUNG were recruited as subjects. While ELD were running on the treadmill at their preferred speed, the lengths of the MG fascicles and tendinous tissues (Lfa and LTT respectively) were measured by ultrasonography together with kinematics and lower-leg muscle activities. Results Although the behaviour of the MG muscle?tendon unit did not show any significant differences between both groups during the contact, our results showed significant differences in fascicle?tendinous tissue behaviour as well as muscle activities. The LTT during the entire contact phase was greater in ELD than in YOUNG (P < 0.001). Co-activation of lower-leg muscles from pre-activation to braking phases was higher in ELD than in YOUNG (P < 0.01). The changes of the Lfa during contact were less, and the LTT shortening was greater in ELD than in YOUNG (P < 0.001). Conclusion These results imply that ELD cannot activate their muscles similar to YOUNG during running, and those different activities may modify the Lfa to utilize the tendon elasticity effectively.

AB  - ObjectiveTo investigate the general health status of asylum seekers and their access to health services. DesignProspective questionnaire survey. SettingA community-based asylum seeker centre in Sydney from March to September 1994, before the Limited Health Care Assistance Scheme had taken effect. ParticipantsForty of 57 eligible asylum seekers from 21 different countries attending English language classes. Main outcome measuresResults on the traumatic events section of the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, a postmigratory problem checklist, the COOP Functional Health Assessment charts, the Duke-University of Northern Carolina Health Profile, and a structured interview to assess difficulties in accessing health care in Australia. ResultsMore than 30 of the 40 participants reported exposure to past trauma. Asylum seekers were more impaired in their emotional health than a normative group of patients with minor (P< 0.001) and serious (P< 0.001) medical illnesses, and more impaired in role functioning than those with minor medical illnesses (P<0.001). Twenty or more reported symptoms of nervousness, headache, and/or depression; ConclusionsAlthough a selective sample, the asylum seekers in our study appeared to be suffering substantial levels of emotional and somatic symptoms, yet, for most, access to health care was a major problem. The effectiveness of recent sequential changes to the provisions covering welfare and health care for asylum seekers needs to be closely monitored.

AB  - Abstract Surgery for radical treatment of esophageal cancer (EC) carries significant inherent risk. The objective identification of patients who are at high risk of complications is of importance. In this study the prognostic value of cardiopulmonary fitness variables (CPF) derived from cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) was assessed in patients undergoing potentially curative surgery for EC within an enhanced recovery program. OC patients underwent preoperative CPET using automated breath-by-breath respiratory gas analysis, with measurements taken during a ramped exercise test on a bicycle. The prognostic value of , Anaerobic Threshold (AT) and VE/VCO2 derived from CPET were studied in relation to post-operative morbidity, which was collected prospectively, and overall survival. Consecutive 120 patients were included for analysis (median age 65 years, 100 male, 75 neoadjuvant therapy). Median AT in the cohort developing major morbidity (Clavien?Dindo classification >2) was 10.4 mL/kg/min compared with 11.3 mL/kg/min with no major morbidity (P = 0.048). Median in the cohort developing major morbidity was 17.0 mL/kg/min compared with 18.7 mL/kg/min in the cohort (P = 0.009). optimum cut-off was 17.0 mL/kg/min (sensitivity 70%, specificity 53%) and for AT was 10.5 mL/kg/min (sensitivity 60%, specificity 44%). Multivariable analysis revealed to be the only independent factor to predict major morbidity (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75?0.97, P = 0.018). Cumulative survival was associated with operative morbidity severity (?2 = 4.892, df = 1, P = 0.027). These results indicate that as derived from CPET is a significant predictor of major morbidity after oesophagectomy highlighting the physiological importance of cardiopulmonary fitness.

AB  - Abstract Objective To define and compare clinical characteristics of canine primary appendicular hemangiosarcoma (HSA) and telangiectatic osteosarcoma (tOSA), including signalment, presentation, response to treatment, and prognosis. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study. Animals Seventy dogs with primary appendicular HSA or tOSA. Methods Patient data were obtained from institutions' medical records. Immunohistochemistry was applied to archived tissues to establish tumor type. Patient characteristics, treatment responses, and outcomes were described and compared by tumor type. Results Forty-one HSA and 29 tOSA were identified. Dogs with HSA were more likely than dogs with tOSA to be male and have hind limb tumors; 78% of HSA occurred in hind limbs, particularly the tibia. Dogs with tOSA weighed a median of 9.9?kg (95% CI 4.6-15.3) more than dogs with HSA. Most dogs received antineoplastic treatment, predominantly amputation with or without adjuvant chemotherapy. Overall survival with local treatment and chemotherapy was 299 days (95% CI 123-750) for HSA and 213 days (95% CI 77-310) for tOSA. Younger age and more aggressive treatment were associated with longer survival in dogs with HSA but not tOSA. One-year survival rates did not differ between dogs with HSA (28%) and those with tOSA (7%). Conclusion Distinct clinical features were identified between HSA and tOSA in this population. Both tumors were aggressive, with a high incidence of pulmonary metastases. However, local treatment combined with chemotherapy led to an average survival 7 months for tOSA and 10 months for HSA. Clinical significance HSA should be considered as a differential in dogs with aggressive lytic bone lesions, particularly medium-sized dogs with tibial lesions. HSA has a unique clinical presentation but similar therapeutic response and outcome to OSA. Amputation and chemotherapy appear to prolong survival in some dogs with HSA and tOSA.

AB  - Abstract Unfocused extracorporeal shock waves (UESW) have been shown to have an anabolic effect on bone mass. Therefore we investigated the effects of UESW on bone in osteoporotic rats with and without anti-resorptive treatment. Twenty-week-old rats were ovariectomized (n?=?27). One group was treated with saline and another group with Alendronate (ALN) 2.4?µg/kg, 3?/week. UESW were applied 2 weeks after ovariectomy. Thousand UESW were applied to one hind leg, the contra-lateral hind leg was not treated and served as control. With the use of in vivo micro-CT scanning it was shown that in saline treated rats trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV) was higher at 2 weeks follow-up in UESW treated legs compared to control legs. However, at 4 and 10 weeks no difference was found. In ALN treated animals UESW led to a pronounced anabolic response resulting in an increase in BV/TV at all time-points. Furthermore, UESW resulted in increased cortical volume (CtV), higher trabecular connectivity and, more plate-like and thicker trabeculae. Biomechanical testing showed that UESW lead to a higher maximum force before failure and higher stiffness in all treatment groups. With histology abundant areas of intramembranous bone formation along the periosteal cortex and within the bone marrow were observed. In conclusion this study shows promising results for the use of UESW in the treatment of osteoporosis, especially when this treatment is combined with an anti-resorptive treatment. ? 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives We previously reported on a fetoscopic repair for open neural tube defect (ONTD) using a single layer closure (SLC). Because of a high rate of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak at birth we developed a 3 layer closure (3LC) comprising a bovine collagen patch, a myofascial layer and a skin layer, using the same exteriorized uterus, fetoscopic technique. Methods Prospective cohort study: 32 consecutive SLC controls were compared with 18 consecutive 3LC cases. All patients satisfied Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) criteria. Obstetric, maternal, fetal, and early neonatal outcomes were compared. Results Maternal demographics and gestational age at fetal surgery (24.9 ±?0.7 vs. 25.0 ±?0.5?weeks; p = NS) and at delivery (36.5 ±?3.5 vs. 37.6 ±?3.1?weeks; p = 0.14) were similar for SLC vs. 3LC, respectively. PPROM <?37?weeks (28% vs. 29%; p = NS), timing of PPROM (32.3 ±?3.4 vs. 32.7 ±?1.9?weeks; p = NS), and vaginal delivery (50% vs. 47%; p = 0.8) were similar for SLC vs. 3LC respectively. SLC showed a significantly higher rate of CSF leak (8/32 (25%) vs. 3LC (0/17 (0%); p = 0.02), and a lower rate of reversal of hind brain herniation at 6?weeks postoperatively (SLC = 18/30 (60%) vs. 3LC = 14/15 (93%); p 0.02). The rates of meeting MOMS criteria for hydrocephalus (SLC = 23/31 (74%) vs. 3LC = 7/12 (58%); p = 0.31) and requiring treatment for hydrocephalus at 12 months (15/32 (47%) SLC controls vs. 4/12 (33%) 3LC; p=0.14) were similar. Conclusions Compared to SLC, 3LC preserves the fetal and obstetric benefits of fetoscopic repair, and shows improved rates of CSF leakage and reversal of hindbrain herniation at 6?weeks postoperatively.

AB  - Summary.? Muscle haematoma represents 10?25% of bleeds in patients with severe haemophilia. There is limited consensus on diagnostic or treatment strategies and little knowledge about the natural history of muscle haematoma and optimal treatment goals. The aim of this review was to perform a systematic description of the natural history of muscle haematoma in healthy athletes, focusing on diagnosis, classification and treatment options. Publications and educational textbooks on management of sports injuries were used as data source. Muscle haematomas occur following contusion, strain, or laceration and can be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. Muscle haematoma may be inter- or intramuscular. In healthy athletes, the healing process takes 20?40?days. Optimal diagnosis includes history, physical examination (inspection, palpation, active and passive range of motion (ROM) test, muscle length test, isometric strength test, biomechanical examination, full spinal examination, peripheral nerve test and slump test), ultrasound, MRI or CT. Treatment is conducted based on: (i) super-acute stage, control of the bleeding and minimizing the size of the haematoma; (ii) acute stage, restoration of pain-free ROM; (iii) subacute stage, functional rehabilitation; and (iv) gradual return to normal activity. Treatment and preventive strategies include RICE (rest, ice, compression and elevation), protected mobilization, stretching and strengthening exercises, manual therapy (articular, neural and soft tissue mobilization and massage), correction of movement dysfunction, functional rehabilitation and electro-therapeutic interventions. The study reviews the natural history of muscle haematoma and state-of-the-art diagnosis and treatment in healthy athletes. Results may be useful to optimize diagnosis and treatment of muscle haematoma in patients with haemophilia.
