AB  - Summary Pancreatic pseudocysts of whatever etiology have traditionally been treated surgically. Recently endoscopy has been employed with success in their drainage leading to resolution. Trans-gastric drainage by endoscopy has been facilitated by endoultrasound and the use of ERCP-derived techniques such as sphincerotome use, stent placement over guidewires, and the use of pig-tail and straight stents which are left in situ usually without need for endoscopic removal. This has occurred in childhood with success recently.

AB  - Summary Antepartum hemorrhage is a common complication in pregnancy associated with fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. There are many causes, with the most serious being placental disorders such as placenta previa or accreta which present with painless bleeding and placental abruption which presents with painful bleeding. Imaging may not always be the most appropriate course of action but ultrasound is used most commonly to investigate ante-partum hemorrhage in stable patients although there may be a role for MRI in placental insertion disorders. The mainstay of management is ensure hemodynamic stability of the patient and appropriately timed delivery of the fetus. It is important to identify patients who may be at risk of ante-partum hemorrhage and plan their care on an individualized basis. Search strategy: EMBASE and PUBMED were used to search the keywords with a focus on meta-analysis and systematic reviews.

AB  - Objective To determine the prevalence, outcome and risk factors for postoperative pyothorax in dogs undergoing thoracic surgery. Methods Case records were reviewed retrospectively to identify dogs with post thoracic surgery pyothorax, defined as septic neutrophilic inflammation within the pleural space based on cytology and/or a positive bacterial culture of pleural fluid. Those identified were reviewed for potential risk factors for postoperative pyothorax based on biological plausibility and previously published data. These potential risk factors were explored by multivariable logistic regression. Results Of 232 dogs undergoing thoracic surgery, 15 (6·5%) dogs developed pyothorax. Bacteria cultured included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multi-resistant Escherichia coli. Of these dogs, six died, four were euthanased and five were treated successfully. A diagnosis of idiopathic chylothorax [Odds Ratio (OR)=12·5, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)=2·7-58·5, P=0·001], preoperative intrathoracic biopsy (OR=14·3, 95% CI=1·7-118·7, P=0·014) and preoperative thoracocentesis (OR=11·2, 95% CI=1·6-78·2, P=0·015) were identified as independent risk factors for development of postoperative pyothorax. Clinical Significance Idiopathic chylothorax, intrathoracic biopsy and prior thoracocentesis are independent risk factors for postoperative pyothorax, which was associated with a 67% mortality rate.

AB  - Background Pediatric emergency care provision in the United States is uneven. Institutional barriers to readiness in the general emergency department (GED) are known, but little is understood about the frontline providers. Our objective was to explore the lived experiences of emergency medicine (EM) providers caring for acutely ill children in the GED and identify opportunities to optimize their pediatric practice. Methods This grounded theory study used theoretical sampling with snowball recruitment to enroll EM physicians and advanced practice providers from 25 Wisconsin GEDs. Participants completed one-on-one, semistructured interviews. Audio recordings were transcribed and coded by a multi-investigator team drawing on theory produced from comparative analysis. Results We reached theoretical saturation with 18 participants. The data suggested that providers felt competent managing routine pediatric care, but critically ill children outstripped their resources and expertise. They recognized environmental constraints on the care they could safely provide, which were intensified by unanticipated knowledge gaps and lack of awareness regarding pediatric practice guidelines. A fragmented medical network to support their pediatric practice was identified as a challenge to their care provision at critical junctures. Due to lack of guidance and feedback, providers internalized their experience with critically ill children with uncertainty, which limited learning and practice change. They benefited from meaningful relationships with pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists, targeted education, timely consults, and looped feedback about care provided and patient outcomes. Conclusions General ED providers struggled with critically ill children because they could not anticipate their pediatric-specific knowledge gaps and only realized them at critical junctures. EM providers were isolated and frustrated when seeking help; without guidance and feedback they internalized their experience with uncertainty and were left underprepared for subsequent encounters. The data suggested the need for provider-focused interventions to address gaps in pediatric-specific continuing medical education, just-in-time assistance, and knowledge transfer.

AB  - Objective Bladder tumors are among the most common types of malignant neoplasms of the urinary tract. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential value of 3-dimensional (3D) sonography and sonographic cystoscopy in detection of bladder tumors. Methods Thirty-one patients with suspected or known bladder tumors were included this study. All patients underwent 3D sonography and conventional cystoscopy within 15 days. The number, size, location, and morphologic features of the lesions were evaluated on gray scale, 3D virtual, and multiplanar reconstruction images obtained from the patients. The results of 3D sonographic cystoscopy were compared with the findings from conventional cystoscopy, which was considered the reference standard. Results Twenty-eight (90.3%) of 31 3D virtual sonographic cystoscopic studies had good or excellent image quality. Conventional cystoscopy revealed 47 lesions in 22 of 28 patients; 3D sonographic virtual cystoscopy showed 41 (87.2%) of 47 lesions. Three-dimensional virtual sonography alone had sensitivity of 96.2%, specificity of 70.6%, a positive predictive value of 93.9%, and a negative predictive value of 80% for tumor detection. The combination of gray scale sonography, multiplanar reconstruction, and 3D virtual sonography had sensitivity of 96.4%, specificity of 88.8%, a positive predictive value of 97.6%, and a negative predictive value of 84.2% for tumor detection. Conclusions Three-dimensional sonography is a promising alternative noninvasive technique for use in detection of bladder tumors, their localization, and perivesical spreading. The location, size, and morphologic features of the tumors shown on 3D sonography agreed well with the findings of conventional cystoscopy.

Most often, these malformations are discovered prenatally or in early infancy, but some are not diagnosed until late childhood or adulthood. The purpose of this pictorial review is to illustrate the multi-modality imaging characteristics in these complex anomalies and to provide a systematic radiological approach aiming at improving diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - Abstract The objectives of this study were to quantitatively evaluate the articular cartilage layers of the ankle and describe the cartilage topographical distribution across the joint surfaces using high resolution MRI and image segmentation. An anisotropic diffusion noise reduction algorithm and a directional gradient vector flow (dGVF) snake segmentation algorithm were applied to cartilage sensitive MR images. Eight cadaveric ankles were studied. Six repeated data sets were acquired in five of the ankles. Quantitative parameters were calculated for each cartilage layer; coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated from the six repeated data sets; and 3D thickness distribution maps were generated. The noise reduction algorithm produced marked image enhancement. Mean cartilage thickness ranged from 0.91?±?0.08 mm in the fibula to 1.34?±?0.14 mm in the talus. Mean cartilage volume was 3.32?±?0.55 ml, 1.72?±?0.25 ml, and 0.35?±?0.06 ml for the talus, tibia, and fibula, respectively. Mean CV ranged 2.82%?5.04% for quantitative parameters in the talus and tibia. The reported noise reduction and segmentation technique allow precise extraction of ankle cartilage and 3D reconstructions show that the thickest cartilage occurs over the talar shoulders, where osteochondritits dissecans (OCD) lesions commonly occur. ? 2006 Orthopaedic Research Society.
