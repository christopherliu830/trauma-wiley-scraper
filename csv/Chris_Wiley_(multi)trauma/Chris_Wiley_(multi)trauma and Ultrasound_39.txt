AB  - Summary This report describes two cases of successful surgical management of granulosa cell tumours (GCT) in mares presenting with haemoperitoneum (HP). Controlled abdominal drainage was initially attempted in Case 1 but was not successful. A ventral midline exploratory laparotomy allowed removal of a haemorrhaging 13 kg GCT. The mare made a full recovery and returned to normal work as a driving pony 11 months post-operatively. In Case 2 controlled abdominal drainage was followed by standing left flank laparoscopic visualisation of the bleeding ovary and transection of the ovarian pedicle by electrocautery. The GCT was then removed via a ventral midline incision due to its large size. Haemoperitoneum can be associated with GCTs and in some cases is severe enough to prompt emergency treatment. Stabilisation of the patient and removal of the haemorrhaging GCT can lead to a successful outcome.

AB  - Objective Disruption to endochondral ossification leads to delayed and irregular bone formation and can result in a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders known as osteochondrodysplasias. These genetic disorders arise through disturbances in the complex processes of skeletal growth causing development of unsightly skeletal deformities. Methods? Each syndrome was diagnosed on the basis of detailed clinical and radiographic assessment. Lower limb deformities were the prime presenting feature. Results Here are presented three patients with diverse genetic syndromes, namely Wolcott?Rallison syndrome (WRS), Kniest dysplasia (KD) and Desbuquois dysplasia (DS). Genetic testing was performed in the patients with WRS and DS. The diagnosis of KD was made purely on a clinical and radiographic basis. Variable orthopaedic interventions to realign these patients' lower limbs were implemented with the aim of improving their balance and gait. Conclusions The aim of this paper is twofold. The first part is to outline the importance of diagnosing the causes of various skeletal abnormalities in patients with osteochondrodysplasias by phenotypic and genotypic characterization. The second part is to demonstrate our techniques for surgical corrections in patients with joint laxity and malalignment and show how far techniques for growth modulation, re-alignment and ligament reconstruction have advanced.

AB  - Abstract A fistula between the pulmonary artery (PA) and the left atrium (LA) is a rare congenital heart disease that usually presents with cyanosis, clubbing, and dyspnea, as well as the signs and symptoms of a right-to-left shunt. Herein, we report a 16-year-old girl with a fistula between the right PA and the LA. This type of fistula could lead to systemic desaturation. This patient also had an atrial septal defect of the secundum type and has been followed up without treatment. The clinical manifestations and treatment of fistulas located between the PA and LA are also reviewed in this report.

AB  - This case report describes the reconstruction of a segmental ulnar defect using a vascularized rib graft. A 27-year-old man was injured during military service by an improvised explosive device, resulting in bilateral through-the-knee amputations, left hand deformity, and a segmental left ulnar defect. After unsuccessful ulnar reconstruction with nonvascularized autologous bone and allograft bone substitutes, he presented to our institution. We removed the residual allograft fragments from the ulnar defect, harvested a vascularized left sixth rib with the intercostal artery and vein, secured the construct with internal hardware, and performed microanastomoses of the intercostal artery and vein to the posterior interosseous artery and vein. Postoperatively, he had a hematoma at the vascularized graft recipient site caused by anticoagulation therapy for his chronic deep vein thrombosis. Despite this, the rib graft successfully incorporated on the basis of radiographic and clinical examinations at 27 months. He had no pain and good function of the arm. The results of this case suggest that a vascularized rib graft for forearm reconstruction may be a viable option with minimal donor site morbidity. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Minimally invasive techniques enable diagnostics and surgery to be performed through a small incision. This greatly reduces the damage to healthy tissue leading to faster recovery times for the patient. However, the surgeon is deprived of the sensory feedback available with normal surgical techniques. Miniaturised sensors can provide this information about location, diagnostics and the treatment. This application severely limits the size of the device, with some catheters being less than 1 mm in diameter. Catheters are usually defined in multiples of 1/3 mm or 1 french. Further important issues are bio-compatibility, safety and the ability of the sensor to withstand the working environment. Sensors able to meet these demands are improving the efficiency of operations and are opening new opportunities for minimally invasive techniques.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report the outcome of dogs with presumptive echocardiographic idiopathic pericardial effusion treated with thoracoscopic pericardectomy and pericardioscopy. Study design Multi-institutional retrospective study (2011-2017). Animals Eighteen dogs. Methods Records were searched for dogs with pericardial effusion and no identified cause by preoperative echocardiography and subsequent thoracoscopic pericardectomy and pericardioscopy. Collected data included presenting complaint, physical examination, laboratory results, imaging, and operative findings. Follow-up was obtained via telephone interview and/or recheck examination. Results No evidence of mass lesions or cause for the effusion was identified in any of the dogs by preoperative echocardiography. Nine dogs had unremarkable pericardioscopic examination results. Nine dogs had pericardioscopic abnormalities consistent with masses, nodules, or adhesions. Median survival time (MST) for the 9 dogs with abnormalities identified by pericardioscopy was 66 days, whereas MST for the 9 dogs with unremarkable pericardioscopic examination results was not reached (P?=?.0067). Median survival time for dogs based on histopathologic diagnosis alone was not different between dogs with a diagnosis of neoplasia and dogs with a diagnosis of pericarditis (P?=?.1056). Among dogs with lesions identified during pericardioscopy, MST did not differ between those with a diagnosis of malignancy and those with a diagnosis of pericarditis (P?=?.78). Conclusion Dogs with presumptive idiopathic pericardial effusion without evidence of masses, nodules, and/or adhesions during thoracoscopic pericardectomy and pericardioscopy lived longer than dogs in which abnormalities were identified during pericardioscopy. Clinical significance Thoracoscopic pericardectomy/pericardioscopy and targeted biopsy of the pericardium and pleura are recommended in dogs with echocardiographic idiopathic pericardial effusion.

AB  - 1 Tallie Z. Baram, 1 Kristen L. Brunson, 1 Celine Dube, 1 Sarit Avishai-Eliner, and 1 Kristina A. Fenoglio ( 1 Pediatrics, Anatomy/ Neurobiology, UCI, Irvine, CA ) Seizures often arise in the setting of an acute injury or insult. In addition, many of the epilepsies are ?symptomatic?, i.e., they occur in individuals who had sustained injury or insult such as infection, trauma, or stroke. The mechanisms by which diverse factors such as infection or trauma provoke both acute seizures and recurrent, chronic seizures (epilepsy) are not fully understood. To some extent, each of these insults may initiate a unique chain of events that promotes epilepsy. However, these insults also share commonalities that set in motion cellular and molecular changes that promote neuronal hyperexcitability: All these epilepsy- provoking insults are stressful, in that they trigger the release and actions of ?stress-mediating molecules?, including glucocorticoids and the intrinsic central nervous system (CNS) stress-activated neuro-peptide, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). Stress induces release of CRH from hippocampal interneurons, and CRH acts on selective receptors (CRF-R1) to enhance glutamate-mediated neurotransmission. In immature hippocampus, CRH and the CRH receptors are particularly abundant, so that the peptide may excite neurons sufficiently to evoke seizures, followed by dendritic atrophy or death of vulnerable neurons. In animal models, chronic enhancement of CRH levels within the developing hippocampus, may result in enduring reduction of hippocampus- governed learning and memory function. Such levels might be found in infants with chronic CNS stressors including congenital infection, dysplasia, trauma or recurrent seizures. Indeed, drugs that downregulate CRH levels in limbic structures (e.g., ACTH) are potent antiepileptics in the developing CNS. In summary, acute and chronic stress elicits the release of pro-excitatory molecules (CRH), promoting seizures. These further activate the ?stress response?, leading to a vicious cycle culminating in loss of neuronal function and integrity.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the use of a gastrointestinal anastomosis (GIA) stapling device to perform small intestinal anastomosis in the dog. Methods: A retrospective study to evaluate the use of a GIA stapling device to perform small intestinal anastomosis in 15 dogs. Results: Reasons for intervention included dehiscence of a previous enterotomy (four of 15), intestinal neoplasia (five of 15), vascular compromise (three of 15), intussusception (two of 15) and foreign body (one of 15). The mean time taken to perform the anastomosis was 7·7 minutes (range five to 12 minutes). No operative complications were recorded and all dogs recovered from the surgery. Major (two dogs) and minor (six dogs) short-term complications of pyrexia and anorexia were recorded in six dogs. In five of these, the cause was considered to be related to a pre-existing peritonitis. One dog was euthanased five months postoperatively for a multi-centric recurrence of intestinal lymphoma. Six month follow-up confirmed an unremarkable and complete recovery in all remaining dogs. No major or minor long-term complications were recorded in any individual. Clinical Significance: A modified stapled functional end-to-end intestinal anastomosis holds merit and should be considered a viable alternative to other stapled and sutured anastomosis techniques.

AB  - ?? Emergent definitive care of orthopaedic injuries in critical patients may not be the best strategy. ?? Critically injured patients not in the operating room for life-saving procedures should be physiologically stable prior to major surgical procedures. ?? Patients with closed head injuries must maintain optimal parameters for best recovery. ?? Damage control orthopaedic surgery (DCO) is the most controversial and least understood concept in modern trauma surgery. ?? A damage control approach to fracture care in the multiple trauma patient has merit. ?? Literature (mostly retrospective and single center) is weak and can be interpreted as desired. ?? Early major fracture care may be beneficial 1 Need to define early 2 Need to define fracture fixation ?? Surgery is performed to improve the physiology of the patient. ?? External fixation and delayed definitive fixation for patients in the operating room. ?? Bedside application of external fixation or traction until the patient is physiologically stable for definitive care in patients not in need of life-saving surgery. ??

AB  - Objective The objective of this study was to obtain a nomogram of the clivus-suvraocciput angle as a basis for the diagnosis of Chiari II malformation in fetuses with ventriculomegaly. Design A cross-sectional study was undertaken on 310 normal pregnant women of 16?34?weeks' gestation. A mid-sagittal section of the fetal skull was obtained and the angle between the clivus and the supraocciput was measured. 44 fetuses with ventriculomegaly due to different causes (13 Chiari II malformation, 12 dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, 7 aqueductal stenosis, 6 borderline ventriculomegaly, 3 Dandy-Walker malformation, 2 porencephaly, 1 schizencephaly) were also included into the study and the values of the angle found in the pathological cases were compared with that found in the normal population. Results The clivus-supraocciput angle did not change during gestation and was almost constant with an average value of 79,3°?±?6°. All cases of Chiari II malformation showed a value below the 10th centile of our nomogram; all the remaining cases of ventriculomegaly showed normal values of the angle. Conclusions The evaluation of the posterior fossa and particularly the measurement of the clivus-supraocciput angle is a useful parameter to differentiate the various causes of fetal ventriculomegaly and particularly to recognize Chiari II malformation. The measurement of the angle could be also useful to screen for spina bifida which is almost constantely associated to Chiari II malformation.

AB  - Introduction The hypothesis was tested whether the improvement in the human fetal cardiac diastolic and systolic functions are associated with changes in the cardiac volume blood flow, inflow blood velocity waveform characteristics, systemic venous blood flow parameters, umbilical artery velocimetry and fetal nuchal translucency. By a longitudinal study protocol the inflow and outflow blood velocity waveforms were obtained in 16 uncomplicated pregnancies at 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10?weeks. Results The proportion of isovolumetric relaxation time decreased and the proportions of filling and ejection times of the cardiac cycle increased significantly from 6 to 7?weeks. The proportion of isovolumetric contraction decreased between 8 and 9?weeks. Every inflow waveform was monophasic before 9?weeks but it was biphasic in all cases at 10?weeks. Mean velocity of inflow and outflow increased between 6 and 7?weeks and Vmean of inflow increased further after 8?weeks. At 9 and 10?weeks, atrioventriculu valve recurgitation (AVVR) was present in 4 and 7 fetuses, respectively. Nuchal translucency was greater in fetuses with AVVR present at 10?weeks compared with non-AVVR cases. Conclusion Improvement in the diastolic function of fetal heart between 6 and 7?weeks is accompanied by simultaneous increase in the mean velocities across inflow and outflow tracts. Appearance of biphasic inflow pattern is associated with significant change in systolic function between 8 and 9?weeks. AVVR is a common finding at 10?weeks of gestation.
