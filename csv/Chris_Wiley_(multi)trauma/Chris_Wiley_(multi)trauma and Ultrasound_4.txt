AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the orthopedic and hand trauma. Pelvic binders reduce transfusion requirements, the length of hospital stay and mortality in patients with anteroposterior compression (APC) injuries. Although patients that sustain pelvic ring injuries complain of pelvic and low back pain, women have significant risk for pain with sexual intercourse. Women have a more than double rate of having a cesarean section after having a pelvic fracture. The rate of low back pain, posterior pelvic pain, and leg length discrepancy is not different from men. Wrist pain without acute radiographic findings occurs. Radial-sided wrist pain may indicate an occult scaphoid fracture. If there are no definitive radiographic findings, the best plan is to immobilize the wrist and repeat evaluation. If they still have radial-sided wrist pain, then referral to an orthopedic surgeon is appropriate.

AB  - Malignant tumours of the testis are the leading cause of cancer death in males between the ages of 25 and 35. Benign cystic or solid intra-tunica albuginea tumours of the testis are rare. Testicular ultrasound studies are not sufficiently accurate to establish a pre-operative diagnosis of a benign intra-tunica albuginea tumour but may assist in the diagnosis of inflammation, unequal uniform testicular size or where the anatomy has been altered by previous surgery or trauma.

AB  - Aim To investigate the value of 3D-ultrasound in predicting fetal weight at delivery. Patients and methods The study group consisted of 251 pregnant women (formula-finding group: n?=?125; evaluation group: n?=?126) with a singleton pregnancy and an ultrasound examination within seven days of delivery. Pregnancies with major structural or chromosomal anomalies were excluded. Ultrasound examinations included standard biometry as well as three-dimensional volumetry of the upper arm, the thigh and the abdomen of the fetus. All examinations were performed with a Voluson 530D MT system (Kretztechnik, Zipf, Austria). The results were compared with commonly used weight formulas. Results All measurements were completed successfully. Polynomial regression analysis with standard biometric parameters and volumes of the upper arm, the thigh and the abdomen was employed to yield the best-fit formula for prediction of fetal weight at birth. The new 3D formula (Estimated fetal weight (EFW)?=?? 1478.557?+?7.242 * thigh volume +?13.309 * upper arm volume +?852.998 * lg abdominal volume +?0.526 * BIP3) proved to be superior to established two-dimensional equations with the lowest mean error (25.8?±?194.4 g), the lowest mean absolute error (155.2?±?118.2 g) and the lowest mean absolute percentage error (6.1?±?5.0%) when studied prospectively in the evaluation group. Conclusion Fetal weight estimation by 3D?ultrasound compares favourably with conventional 2D?formulas.

AB  - Background: The efficacy of epidural anaesthesia depends on the accurate identification of the epidural space (ES). Abnormal anatomical conditions may make the procedure difficult or impossible. The aim of this study was to investigate whether pre-puncture ultrasound examination of the spinal anatomy might be beneficial in expected cases of difficult epidural anaesthesia. Methods: We used digital ultrasound equipment with a 5-MHz transducer to assess the anatomy of the ES and the posterior parts of the spinal column. We examined 72 parturients with abnormal anatomical conditions who were scheduled for epidural anaesthesia. The women were randomised into two equal groups. In all patients, the standard loss of resistance technique was used. In the ultrasound group, an ultrasound examination of the appropriate spinal region was conducted prior to epidural puncture. ES depth seen on the ultrasound images was compared to the ES depth measured by the needle. We compared the number of puncture attempts with the standard method (control group) to the number of attempts under ultrasound guidance. Results: Ultrasonography significantly improved operating conditions for epidural anaesthesia. The maximum VAS scores and patient acceptance were significantly better. Conclusions: With ultrasound measurement of the ES depth, the quality of epidural anaesthesia was enhanced.

AB  - Objectives:? Occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) is a peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) technique that has been used with success in the management of intractable chronic daily headaches (CDHs) and occipital neuralgia (ON). The technique involves the placement of a stimulating surgical or percutaneous electrode over the occipital nerves within the subcutaneous tissues at the skull base. Until recently, procedures involving the occipital nerves were based on identifying bony or arterial landmarks with direct palpation or fluoroscopy. Although universally accepted as an imaging technique, fluoroscopy does not provide real-time imaging of the occipital nerves or vessels. Furthermore, therapeutic efficacy of ONS is directly related to the ability of the stimulating electrode to produce peripheral nerve dermatomal paresthesia, emphasizing the need for precision placement. Materials and Methods:? A total of six patients, diagnosed with refractory CDH and ON, after failing extensive medical management, were diagnosed as potential candidates for ONS. Subsequently, all underwent successful percutaneous trials of bilateral octopolar (Advanced Neuromodulation Systems, Plano, TX, USA) ONS under ultrasound guidance, followed by permanent surgical implantation. Results:? In this case series, ultrasound provided accurate, real-time placement of introducer needles and stimulating electrodes by allowing visualization of tissue planes (epidermis, dermis, subcutaneous fat, and trapezious muscle), as well as vessels and nervous structures. Conclusions:? Ultrasound imaging has been used increasingly for peripheral nerve blockade in surgical anesthesia and in chronic pain management as it allows real-time localization of both nervous and vascular structures (color flow Doppler) and, thus, a method for increasing blockade precision and safety. As an adjunct to ONS, the position of the introducer needles and electrodes can be visualized in relation to the occipital nerves and vasculature. This reproducible positioning allows accurate depth of placement (assuring production of the prerequisite PNS dermatomal paresthesia required for ONS efficacy) and limits the risk of injury to the occipital artery or nerve(s). In this case series, ultrasonography provided real-time, safe, and reliable placement of ONS electrodes. It also allowed identification of nervous and vascular structures unable to be seen with fluoroscopy, The portable nature of modern ultrasound machines, together with an ever improving pixelation of the Doppler color flow images/real-time measurements, and a lack of radiation exposure make this technology an attractive emerging modality in the field of Neuromodulation.

AB  - Summary This chapter provides an overview of the pathology, epidemiology, prevention, identification and management of the most significant complications affecting the orthopaedic and trauma patient. These complications can be life threatening and lead to delays in recovery. They are often preventable and when they are not, early detection is vital so that interventions can be activated which minimise the consequences. The practitioner needs to understand how to prevent, recognise and manage complications ? both those which are general and relatively common and those which are relatively rare and related specifically to orthopaedic and trauma conditions and care. Some of the considerable evidence base which identifies best practice in risk management, detection and care are considered here so that the practitioner is provided with some guidance for practice in the most common complications: infection (including urinary and respiratory tract infections), compartment syndrome, fat embolism, venous thromboembolism, urinary retention, shock and constipation.

AB  - Abstract Background A teleoperation system for bevel-tipped flexible needle steering has been evaluated. Robotic systems have been exploited as the main tool to achieve high accuracy and reliability. However, for reasons of safety and acceptance by the surgical community, keeping the physician tightly in the loop is preferable. Methods The system uses ultrasound imaging, path planning, and control to compute the desired needle orientation during the insertion and intuitively passes this information to the operator, who teleoperates the motion of the needle's tip. Navigation cues about the computed orientation are provided through haptic and visual feedback to the operator to steer the needle. Results The targeting accuracy of several co-manipulation strategies were studied in four sets of experiments involving human subjects with clinical backgrounds. Conclusions Experimental results show that receiving feedback regarding the desired needle orientation improves the targeting accuracy by a factor of 9 with respect to manual insertions.

AB  - Remarkable changes and continuous growth and development of the early maternal-fetal circulation could be studied by Doppler ultrasound. This approach seems to give more light in understanding of the early pregnancy development. Doppler ultrasound was reported accurate to separate different segments of uterine blood flow during pregnancy. Color flow is used to anatomically locate arcuate, radial and spiral arteries. Pulsed Doppler is then used to study different flow patterns of visualized vessels. Studies of maternal-fetal circulation in early pregnancy may help for better understanding of physiological and pathophysiological hemodynamic changes in the circulation. Investigation of maternal (main uterine, arcuate, radial and spiral) arteries; placental (umbilical, chorionic arterioles) vessels and embryonic/fetal (heart, aorta and intracranial circulation) arteries flow patterns may help to diagnose abnormal implantation and embryonic development. More studies are necessary in order the Doppler technique to be used for clinical assessment in early pregnancy. Safety aspects should also be considered. However, potentials of this technique are promising in study of early pregnancy failure, chromosomal abnormalities, development of pre-eclampsia and IUGR.

AB  - Aim To investigate the role of 3D-ultrasound in estimating the likelihood of conception in an IVF programme. Materials and methods We studied a total of 152 women during their stimulation cycle. Apart from conventional 2D-parameters we assessed endometrial and uterine volume (sub-)endometrial blood flow (sub-)endometrial vessel density and ovarian volume by 3D-ultrasound. Results With regard to subendometrial blood flow on day 1 of the stimulation cycle, all 3D-indices were significantly lower in the conception vs. non-conception group. On the day of oocyte retrieval, any difference between the two groups failed to reach statistical significance. The same applied to endometrial volumes. The latter showed a significant corrrelation with uterine size. Ovarian volumes ≤?3?mm (1 SD below the mean) on day 1 of the stimulation cycle were associated with a nonsignificant lower conception rate. Conclusion Quantitative assessment of spiral artery blood flow and vessel density may be an early predictor of IVF success.

AB  - Summary Trauma is the leading cause of death in children. Genitourinary tract injuries are rare, accounting for <3% of trauma cases. The majority of these injuries are due to blunt trauma such as motor vehicle collisions. In developed countries, iatrogenic injuries are especially prominent in the neonatal period whilst school-age children are prone to sports-related injuries, kicks and straddle injuries. Recent literature regarding pediatric genital trauma has focused on identifying and treating sexual abuse injuries as well as distinguishing these injuries from accidental trauma. This chapter reviews common etiologies for traumatic genital injuries and evaluate current diagnostic and treatment options. Risk factors, presenting signs and the evaluation of sexual abuse will also be reviewed.

AB  - Summary Abdominal trauma is second only to head injury as a cause of serious injury in children, and the third most common cause of trauma-related death. The most common organs injured in blunt abdominal trauma are the spleen, liver and kidneys. When the spleen and liver are injured, intraperitoneal bleeding occurs (haemoperitoneum). In all suspected intra-abdominal injuries, the presence or absence of macroscopic blood in the urine must be established. The presence of macroscopic haematuria is strongly predictive of serious intra-abdominal injury and may form part of the basis for further investigation with a computerised tomography (CT) scan. Apart from those patients with intraperitoneal haemorrhage, extraperitoneal extravasation or haematuria, there is a difficult group with ill-defined symptoms and signs that may persist for several days after the injury. On the rare occasion of penetrating thoracic trauma, injuries to the mediastinal structures and lungs should be assumed until proven otherwise.

AB  - Diagnostic ultrasound in the early pregnancy deals with the recognition of normal anatomy and/or the detection of anomalies in very early viable pregnancies. There are clinical situations where the position of the embryo does not allow imaging of the optimal section of a certain organ. This is often the case with the transvaginal approach, where movements of the transducer are limited. Deriving new 2D images by anyplane slicing is an important presentation mode of embryonic 3D ultrasound. Geometric 3D reconstructions can also be helpful for the understanding of the embryonic anatomy. High quality 2D tomograms are the prerequisite of 3D imaging of the tiny embryo and its organs. Such ultrasound tomograms can be achieved by using annular array transducers, which have a thin elevation plane due to symmetric focussing. Examples of multiplane imaging and geometric volume reconstructions in the assessment of the embryonic anatomy will be presented, and the limitations will be discussed.

AB  - Objective In pregnancies complicated by preterm premature rupture of the membranes (pPROM) there are essentially two causes of perinatal death: prematurity and lung hypoplasia. We used ultrasound to try to predict these complications. Design and methods The cervical length was measured by transvaginal ultrasound in 167 pregnancies complicated by pPROM <?32?weeks of gestation. Further in 20 pregnancies with pPROM before 24?weeks of gestation peripheral pulmonary artery (PPA) waveforms were recorded by Doppler technique at weekly interval until delivery and the Pulsatility Index (PI) calculated. Pregnancies were managed conservatively according to an Institutional management protocol. The occurrence of preterm delivery and pulmonary hypoplasia was evaluated and related to ultrasound findings. Results The cervical length at admission predicts the time interval elapsing between pPROM and delivery. Significant differences in PI values from PPA were present from 2?weeks onwards the pPROM between the fetuses who developed pulmonary hypoplasia and those with a normal outcome. Conclusion The measurement of the cervical length and of PPA velocity waveforms may help to establish the risk of developing prematurity and pulmonary hypoplasia in pregnancies complicated by pPROM.

A total of 23 patients with varying degrees of persistent faecal leakage and/or soiling were recruited. Durasphere was injected in the intersphincteric plane under direct ultrasound guidance. All patients were given a general anaesthetic. Patients had ano-rectal physiology, endoanal ultrasound, continence scoring and quality of life measures assessed at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 12?months. Results? A total of 21 patients were followed up for at least 12?months, with two being excluded at the follow-up stage. Friedman two-way analysis of variance of the Cleveland Clinic Score, Faecal Incontinence Quality of Life Score and Diary Response Score demonstrated a significant sustained improvement. There was no significant improvement in number of bowel movements. There was a significant difference in anal squeeze pressure after therapy, but no significant difference in anal resting pressure. Six patients reported no improvement after Durasphere therapy. Conclusions? Durasphere gave sustained improvements in quality of life and continence scores in this study group. Strict criteria are needed to ascertain suitability for Durasphere therapy.

AB  - In the growing embryo, the brain is the first organ system to develop in such a way that it can be imaged in detail with transvaginal ultrasound. The extension of the transvaginal ultrasound technique to 3D imaging makes it possible to obtain new ultrasound images of the developing embryonic brain in planes not available in the original scan plane, to present form and shape, and to calculate volume. New information about the embryonic brain development can be obtained: volume measurements of the embryonic brain compartments reflect the phylogenetic development. The ?old? rhombencephalon is large during the early phase, while the ?young? hemispheres are very small. During a few weeks, this correlation becomes reversed. Using 3D animations this dynamic developmental process can be visualized. Ultrasound technology has reached a level where the diagnosis of embryonic malformations can be made. At present, we are at the borderline of being able to diagnose holoprosencephaly when the embryo is seven to eight weeks. At nine weeks, 3D images of anomalies such as holoprosencephaly and spina bifida have been made. We may expect the rapidly developing 3D technology, with the option of anyplane slicing, to help us establish early diagnoses in the future. Such multiplane presentations of a diagnosis will contribute to increasing the diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - Objective. To report our experience in the assessment of splenic trauma with contrast-coded sonography and a second-generation contrast medium. Methods. From January to May 2002, 120 patients were studied with sonography for suspected splenic trauma. Twenty-five were selected for further imaging because of sonographic findings positive for splenic injury, findings positive for peritoneal fluid only, indeterminate findings, and negative findings with high clinical or laboratory suspicion. These patients underwent contrast-enhanced harmonic sonography and contrast-enhanced helical computed tomography. Results. Among the 25 patients studied, 6 had no spleen trauma at initial and follow-up evaluation. One patient had a hypoperfused spleen without parenchymal damage, and 18 had splenic injuries; these 19 patients were considered positive. Hemoperitoneum was identified by sonography, contrast-enhanced sonography, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography in 74% of the 19 positive cases. Perisplenic clots were recognized in 58% of the cases by computed tomography and in 42% by baseline and enhanced sonography. Splenic infarctions were found in 11% of cases by contrast-enhanced sonography and computed tomography; none was found by unenhanced sonography. Parenchymal traumatic lesions were identified in 12 of 18 patients with splenic injuries by unenhanced sonography, in 17 cases by contrast-enhanced sonography, and in all 18 cases by contrast-enhanced computed tomography. A minimal splenic lesion was found in the single patient with a false-negative contrast-enhanced sonographic finding. Contrast-enhanced sonography correlated appreciably better than unenhanced sonography in detecting injuries and in estimating their extent. Findings undetectable on unenhanced sonography were also noted: splenic hypoperfusion in 11% of positive cases on both contrast-enhanced sonography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography, contrast medium pooling in 21% of cases on both contrast-enhanced sonography and computed tomography, and contrast extravasation in 11% of cases on computed tomography and 5% on contrast-enhanced sonography. Conclusions. Contrast-enhanced sonography is a promising tool in the assessment of splenic trauma. In institutions where sonography is used as the initial procedure, this technique may increase its effectiveness.

AB  - Abstract Background/Purpose:? Non-operative management of blunt splenic trauma (BST) in children is the standard of care with a success rate of greater than 90%. This paper aims to determine the factors which could predict the need for operative intervention in children with BST. Methods:? Prospectively entered data of 69 children with BST, between 1997 and 2008, from a single tertiary level trauma centre, were retrospectively analysed. A radiologist blinded to the outcome reviewed all computed tomography scans retrospectively. Results:? Forty-two children had isolated BST (61%) and 27 children had associated injuries (39%). All except one survived the injury and non-operative treatment was successful in 91%. Six of the 69 children (9%) with BST underwent splenectomy. There was no independent correlation to age, gender, mechanism of injury (MOI), injury grade and the need for splenectomy, whereas haemodynamic instability within 6?h of injury defined as failed resuscitation had a 100% correlation. Conclusion:? Haemodynamic instability, which failed to respond to resuscitation within 6?h, predicted the need for splenectomy in children with BST. Splenic injury grade assessed by computed tomography scan does not predict the need for splenectomy.
