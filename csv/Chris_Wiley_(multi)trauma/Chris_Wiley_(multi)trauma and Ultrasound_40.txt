AB  - Background The aim of the present study is to individuate sonographic markers which make it possible to distinguish borderline ovarian tumors from benign and malignant cysts, thus allowing conservative treatment. Method We reviewed transvaginal sonograms in 23 women who presented borderline ovarian tumors histologically confirmed. Sixteen were premenopausal and 7 postmenopausal. The size and morphologic criteria of each mass and color flow Doppler characteristics were evaluated. We compared these findings with those of 337 patients with benign ovarian tumors and those of 40 patients with malignant ovarian tumors. Results Of the 16 borderline ovarian tumors in premenopause 6 were mucinous cystoadenomas and 10 serous cystoadenomas. Of the 7 borderline tumors in postmenopause 3 were mucinous cystoadenomas and 4 serous cystoadenomas. The analysis of grey scale morphologic findings revealed the presence of solid tissue in 92.5% of malignant masses, in 13.3% of benign tumors (P?<?0.01) and in 31% of LMP tumors (P?<?0.01 vs. malignant, P?=?n.s vs. benign tumors). The presence of papillae within the cysts was significantly higher in borderline tumors (21%) compared to benign and malignant tumors. Three unilocular cysts with a diameter >?5?cm were borderline tumors. Conclusion The most frequent diagnostic imaging was that of a papillae inside a cyst without other signs of complexity and also the presence of septa was frequent. Neither papillae nor septa constituted sensitive sonographic markers.

AB  - Background Urinary tract anomalies are among the most common sonographically identified anomalies in utero with the incidence about 1/250?1/1000 pregnancies. The obstruction can be unilateral or bilateral at the level of urethra, ureteropelvic junction (UPJ), ureterovesical junction (UVJ). Method Obstructive uropathy cases diagnosed antenatally have been retrospectively evaluated in terms of short and long-term outcome. It is important to make early diagnosis and intervention in order to save organ function as possible. Results During last 7?years in our Department, 58 cases with fetal obstructive uropathy were examined and performed 12 interventions. They were diagnosed antenatally with different type of obstruction including posterior urethral valve syndrome, unilateral and bilateral hydronephrosis, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, multicystic kidney. Intervention was performed in 12 cases at different stage of gestation including needling, vesico-amniotic shunting and pelvic shunting. Out of 12 procedures, there was mortality in 5 cases antenatally or neonatally. Conclusion Early diagnosis of the obstruction is very important before the kidney becomes dysplastic. The type of anomalies, level and starting time of pathology and duration of severe obstruction are the main factors for prognosis. Early diagnosis and referral to tertiary center is to be encouraged in order to have early management and intervention in the case of severe obstruction and to save kidney function as early as possible.

AB  - In the context of an implementation study of nuchal translucency (NT) screening for Down's syndrome special attention was devoided to the psycho-social aspects. The impact of age, parity, religion, education together with the reasons for opting in or out for the NT measurement were recorded in 5895 patients. On a sample of 800 patients more specific aspects were addressed such as the level of knowledge about prenatal diagnosis before and after screening, the reaction to the offer of NT screening and the general women's opinion on whether this form of screening should be offered to all pregnant women. Questionnaires devised to measure the anxiety and depression produced by screening (hads) were filled before screening, at 20?weeks' gestation and after delivery by the same group of patients and by 200 controls. Preliminary results are available. 80% of the asked women, with no differences in age, religion and parity choose for NT screening. Main reason for having the NT measured was the hope of avoiding invasive testing and the wish of having more information on their pregnancy. The majority of women experienced positively NT screening even in case of an increased measurement and irrespectively of whether they would terminate an affected pregnancy or not. A slight increase in anxiety level produced by the screening normalized by 20?weeks' gestation.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the changes in flow velocity waveforms in the mid-cerebral artery and in the transverse cerebral sinus in growth restricted fetuses and to correlate these changes between them and with (1) flow velocity waveforms in the ductus venosus and (2) changes in computerized analysis of fetal cardiotocogram. Design Fetuses between 22 and 37?weeks' gestation with an estimated fetal weight below the 5th centile were included in this prospective longitudinal study. Doppler measurements in the umbilical artery, descending aorta, middle cerebral artery, transverse cerebral sinus and ductus venosus were recorded. Fetal heart rate was analyzed by a computer system according to the Dawes-Redman criteria. Results Blood flow within the midcerebral artery and that in the cerebral transverse sinus follow a mirror image distribution. Arterial redistribution is already present when alteration in the venous cerebral circulation develops. We measured a significant correlation between pulsatility index in the transverse cerebral sinus and in the ductus venosus over the study period and at delivery. There was a negative correlation between these indices and short and long-term variability of the fetal heart rate. There was a parallel increase in pulsatility in the ductus venosus and the transverse cerebral sinus. These changes were inversely correlated with fetal heart rate variability and preceded fetal distress. Conclusion Cerebral venous blood flow in IUGR fetuses may be a useful additional investigation to (1) understand better the mechanism of cerebral redistribution in hypoxemic IUGR and (2) to discriminate between fetal adaptation and fetal decompensation in chronic hypoxemia.

AB  - Background Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) complicates 10?15% of monochorionic (MC) and is associated with high perinatal mortality and morbidity. Method Sixteen MC twin pairs were evaluated between 10?14 weeks for delta nuchal translucency (?NT) and Doppler blood flow in ductus venosus (DV). Sequential scans were performed to identify TTTS. Results Neither the 12 cases with ?NT<0.7 mm/normal flow, nor the two cases with ?NT>0.7 mm/normal flow in DV, developed TTTS. The two cases that combined ?NT>0.7 mm and abnormal flow in DV eventually developed TTTS. Conclusion The presence of abnormal blood flow in the DV in MC twins, at 10?14 weeks, may be a precocious anticipatory sign of TTTS.

AB  - We have been studying fetal centralization in the toxemic/IUGR model since 1992, by means of Doppler of the umbilical and middle cerebral arteries and ductus venosus, computerized CTG and cordocentesis. The natural history of fetal centralization may be divided into 3 phases: normoxemic centralization, hypoxemic centralization and decompensation. The natural history of fetal hypoxemia in these models and the patterns of computerized CTG were also described. Having analysed 105 cases of very high-risk pregnancies in the toxemic/IUGR model with fetal centralization, we tried to define the best parameter to indicate the ideal timing for delivery, and the presence of centralization after 28?weeks gestation appears to seems to indicate it.

AB  - Summary Phlegmasia cerulea dolens is a life-threatening complication of acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The clinical picture consists of DVT that causes severe swelling of the entire lower extremity with cyanosis and extremity pain, and may cause arterial insufficiency, compartment syndrome, venous gangrene, and limb amputation. Beyond acute symptoms, DVT carries long-term vascular implications related to the risk of development of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). There are several patient comorbidities that may affect the interventional approach being considered for acute DVT. Aspiration thrombectomy can provide rapid restoration of flow in acute DVT. Venous stenting for acute DVT is usually performed in cases of inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis or iliac vein DVT. When deciding whether or not to proceed with venous stenting, it is critical to determine the degree of venous outflow obstruction after thrombolysis. This can be done with either multiplane venography or intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).

AB  - Menopause is associated with an increase in the incidence of ischemic heart disease and stroke. Loss of ovarian function is characterized by significantly high values of blood and plasma viscosity. After the menopause, thromboxane production increases and correlates with duration of menopause. Large studies have shown that postmenopausal HRT is associated with reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease. The aim of the study was to evaluate the plasma thromboxane and plasma viscosity in relation with Doppler flow parameters in postmenopausal patients treated with HRT. Thirty-two postmenopausal (FSH?>?40 UI/L and estradiol <?100?pmol/L) women (mean age?±?SD, 54.7?±?2.9?years) participated in the study and were submitted to continuous estradiol transdermal supplementation and 12-day courses of medroxyprogesterone acetate every second month. Doppler resistances at the level of uterine and internal carotid arteries, thromboxane plasma levels and plasma viscosity were analyzed in basal condition and after 1, 3 and 6?months. During hormone supplementation, the pulsatility index significantly decreased at the level of analyzed arteries. Similarly, plasma thromboxane levels and plasma viscosity were significantly reduced. Significant correlations were found between thromboxane plasma concentrations, plasma viscosity and uterine artery resistances. Thus HRT seems to be responsible for both direct and indirect modifications at the level of the vessel wall physiology.

AB  - Background To investigate the effects of combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the vascular impedance of the uterine, inferior vesicle and ophtalmic artery. Method Thirty-five postmenopausal patients were analysed in basal condition and during a HRT phase at 1, 3 and 6?months. Patients were divided in two groups: 21 patients whose last menstrual bleeding was 1?5?years ago, and 14 patients with the duration of menopause >?6?years. Color Doppler analysis of the blood flow impedance was performed at the level of the uterine, inferior vesicle and ophtalmic artery. Estradiol plasma concentrations were assayed on the day of Doppler examinations. Results The analysis of the uterine and inferior vesicle artery flow velocities demonstrated significant positive correlations between resistance index (RI) and years of menopause; higher impedance values were obtained in patients with longer interval from last menstrual bleeding (P?<?0.05). The impedance in patients with >?6?years duration of menopause was 0.94?±?0.03 vs., 0.89?±?0.04, in the group of patients with 1?5?years duration of menopause for uterine artery, and for inferior vesicle artery (0.91?±?0.04 vs. 0.98?±?0.02). No significant correlation between baseline RI and time since menopause was noticed (0.72 vs. 0.73, respectively, P?>?0.05) at the level of ophtalmic artery. After six months of HRT plasma estradiol levels inversely correlated with RI uterine (r?=??0.2556; P?=?0.021), inferior vesicle (R?=??0.2653; P?=?0.023) and opthalmic (r?=??0.2211; P?=?0.017) arteries. Conclusion Doppler studies of uterine, inferior vesicle, and ophtalmic artery can provide specific and precise pathophysiological information to assess blood flow variations in correlation with combined HRT administration.

AB  - Background This study was conducted to assess uterine blood flow characteristics in endometrial cancer and to evaluate the influence of myometrial invasion and cancer grading for uterine circulation. Method Transvaginal color doppler was performed on 97 women with endometrial cancer (11 in stage IA, 33 in stage IB, 37 in stage IC, 7 in stage II, 8 in stage III, and 1 in stage IV) and 51 asymptomatic postmenopausal women (control group). Intratumoral and main uterine artery blood flow was recorded and the peak systolic velocity (PSV) and impedance indices (RI, PI) were calculated. Results In 90 of the 97 postmenopausal endometrial cancer patients (92%) abnormal blood flow with low impedance levels (RI: 0.39?±?0.08; PI: 0.51?±?0.15) was found within the endometrial echo or very close to it. Impedance indices in the main uterine arteries were significantly (P?<?0005) lower in women with endometrial cancer than in normal postmenopausal woman. Uterine blood flow was not modified by the cancer grading. There was, no difference in impedance indices of the uterine arteries between myometrial invasion of <?50% and >?50%. Conclusion These results suggest that uterine blood flow analysis in endometrial cancer could not predict the tumor staging and grading, but this examination can provide additional discriminatory information on tumor vascularity which can then be used with morphology for more accurate diagnosis.

AB  - The objective of this work was to assess the feasibility of real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (which acquires data as a volume, instead of a series of planes, eliminating gating) to evaluate fetal cardiac anatomy and function. We evaluated 10 human fetuses including several with congenital heart disease. Transabdominal scanning was performed using a real-time three-dimensional echocardiography system. Four 1.5 second volume clips at 20 volumes/second were obtained for each fetal heart and stored for off-line analysis. Data were reviewed on a graphics workstation. Our results showed that fetal heart data could be acquired rapidly. Fetal heart data were displayed as 3 simultaneous planes. The reviewer could manipulate plane orientation and position in the volume to optimize views. Cardiac motion could be accelerated, slowed, stopped or viewed at its original speed. Although image quality did not equal high-end equipment, cardiac structures, views and function could be consistently visualized. Abnormal structures were readily detected. In conclusion, real-time three-dimensional fetal echocardiography is a feasible and potentially important new technique that will gain importance as equipment performance improves.

AB  - Background The purpose of this study was to test the value of sonographic staging of twin?twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) in predicting the outcome of patients treated with amniocentesis or selective laser photocoagulation of communicating vessels (SLPCV). Methods TTTS was defined as a deep vertical pocket (DVP) in the recipient twin of >?8?cm and in the donor twin <?2?cm. TTTS was staged as follows: Stage I: bladder of donor visible; Stage II: bladder of donor not visible; Stage III: critically abnormal Dopplers; Stage IV: hydrops; Stage V: demise. Patients were treated with amniocentesis or SLPCV. Results There were a statistically significant difference by stage for at least one survivor between the two techniques (Chi-square = 2.63, p?=?0.05), but analysis was limited by sample size (amniocentesis n?=?9, SLPCV n?=?70). In the amniocentesis group there was an 83% (n?=?5) survival rate for two survivors in Stage I and no survivors (n?=?3) in stages II or III. In the SLPCV group, at least one fetus survived 83% of the time, regardless of stage. Conclusion Our preliminary data suggests that analysis of survival data by in TTTS needs stratification by stage. Early stages may be amenable to treatment with amniocentesis, while later stages may not benefit. SLPCV is uniformly effective, regardless of stage, but may not be warranted in early stages of TTTS.

AB  - The differential diagnosis of adnexal masses still represents a challenge. The main goal is to determine whether a given mass is malignant or benign, in order to establish the best therapautical approach. When a clinician face to a woman diagnosed as having an adnexal tumor several parameters may be used to determine the nature of the mass, such as patient's age, menopausal status, clinical complaints, physical examination, tumor's sonographic and Doppler features and serum tumor markers. When these data are collected may be difficult to interpret them all together and the clinician has to rely in one or two of them to predict the diagnosis and to decide the management strategy, guided many times by own experience or strict protocols. A possible solution to this question may be the use of computer modelling. This means the use of statistical or mathematical models developed, using computer aid, to predict adnexal malignancy. Currently, there are two methods that may be used: Multiple Logistic Regression Analysis (MLRA) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Both techniques allow to calculate the probability of a particular event has occurred, in this case a mass to be malignant or benign. By computer modelling, actual independent predictors parameters are identified and may be used combined and simultaneously to predict malignancy. Each method has advantages and disadvantages, being MLRA the statistical technique of choice and ANN a potential newer alternative to MLRA. Several studies have been published using one or both technique to predict adnexal malignancy. The results of these studies are encouraging showing a high diagnostic performance. All studies comparing MLRA to ANN showed the latter seems to be superior. However, it should be taken into account that most of these models have not tested prospectively.

AB  - Background The significance of an increased nuchal translucency measurement (NT) in relation to the fetal karyotype and pregnancy outcome has been evaluated in multiple pregnancies. Methods 115 multiple pregnancies with 252 fetuses, including 100 pairs of twins (70 pairs with dichorionic placentas and 30 pairs with nonochorionic placenta), 9 sets of triplets, 5 sets of quadruplets, and one set of quintuplets, were considered. Results NT was greater than 95th centile in one fetus in 10 out of 70 cases of dichorionic twin pregnancies (14%), in two sets of quadruplets, in 7 out of 30 monochorionic twin pregnancies (23.3%). NT greater than 95th centile in both fetuses was found in one dichorionic twin pregnancy. Two cases of trisomy 21 and one 47, XXY were found. NT greater than 95th centile in 2/2 fetuses with trisomy 21 (one dichorionic twin pregnancy and one tetrachorionic pregnancy), and not enlarged in the 47, XXY (trichorionic triplet pregnancy). A case of skeletal dysplasia and one goldenhar syndrome were found among the 10 cases of increased NT in dichorionic pregnancies. Three intrauterine deaths of both fetuses, one congenital heart disease and a case of twin-to-twin transfusion occurred in 7 cases of increased NT in monochorionic pregnancies. Conclusions An enlarged NT in multiple pregnancies indicates fetuses at risk for chromosomal abnormalities and fetal malformation, as well as monochorionic twin pregnancies at higher risk for an adverse outcome.

AB  - Background The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of fetal venous Doppler in detection of fetal hypoxia and timing of the delivery. Methods The study group consisted of patients with increased risk for developing fetal hypoxia. These were patients with diagnosed fetal intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and patients with pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH), or a combination of both problems. All patients had Doppler assessment of fetal arterial (umbilical artery, aorta, middle cerebral artery) and venous circulation (ductus venosus and umbilical vein), and cardiotocography 24?h before delivery. Collection of postnatal data included pH of umbilical chord blood, admission in neonatal intensive care unit, and perinatal death. Results A total of 360 patients were included in the study (IUGR 48%, PIH 20%, IUGR +?PIH 32%). Deterioration in fetal venous return developed after fetal arterial circulation had been severely compromised. The decrease in end-diastolic flow in ductus venosus anticipated development of umbilical vein pulsatile flow. Patients with pulsations in umbilical vein blood flow had high incidence of perinatal acidosis, morbidity, and mortality. Conclusion Delivery should be performed before umbilical vein pulsations develop. Careful monitoring of ductus venosus blood flow is helpful predictor of this event.

AB  - Objective The objective of this study was to obtain a nomogram of the clivus-suvraocciput angle as a basis for the diagnosis of Chiari II malformation in fetuses with ventriculomegaly. Design A cross-sectional study was undertaken on 310 normal pregnant women of 16?34?weeks' gestation. A mid-sagittal section of the fetal skull was obtained and the angle between the clivus and the supraocciput was measured. 44 fetuses with ventriculomegaly due to different causes (13 Chiari II malformation, 12 dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, 7 aqueductal stenosis, 6 borderline ventriculomegaly, 3 Dandy-Walker malformation, 2 porencephaly, 1 schizencephaly) were also included into the study and the values of the angle found in the pathological cases were compared with that found in the normal population. Results The clivus-supraocciput angle did not change during gestation and was almost constant with an average value of 79,3°?±?6°. All cases of Chiari II malformation showed a value below the 10th centile of our nomogram; all the remaining cases of ventriculomegaly showed normal values of the angle. Conclusions The evaluation of the posterior fossa and particularly the measurement of the clivus-supraocciput angle is a useful parameter to differentiate the various causes of fetal ventriculomegaly and particularly to recognize Chiari II malformation. The measurement of the angle could be also useful to screen for spina bifida which is almost constantely associated to Chiari II malformation.

AB  - Introduction The hypothesis was tested whether the improvement in the human fetal cardiac diastolic and systolic functions are associated with changes in the cardiac volume blood flow, inflow blood velocity waveform characteristics, systemic venous blood flow parameters, umbilical artery velocimetry and fetal nuchal translucency. By a longitudinal study protocol the inflow and outflow blood velocity waveforms were obtained in 16 uncomplicated pregnancies at 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10?weeks. Results The proportion of isovolumetric relaxation time decreased and the proportions of filling and ejection times of the cardiac cycle increased significantly from 6 to 7?weeks. The proportion of isovolumetric contraction decreased between 8 and 9?weeks. Every inflow waveform was monophasic before 9?weeks but it was biphasic in all cases at 10?weeks. Mean velocity of inflow and outflow increased between 6 and 7?weeks and Vmean of inflow increased further after 8?weeks. At 9 and 10?weeks, atrioventriculu valve recurgitation (AVVR) was present in 4 and 7 fetuses, respectively. Nuchal translucency was greater in fetuses with AVVR present at 10?weeks compared with non-AVVR cases. Conclusion Improvement in the diastolic function of fetal heart between 6 and 7?weeks is accompanied by simultaneous increase in the mean velocities across inflow and outflow tracts. Appearance of biphasic inflow pattern is associated with significant change in systolic function between 8 and 9?weeks. AVVR is a common finding at 10?weeks of gestation.

AB  - ?Classic? fetal echocardiography is based on 7 transverse planes: the upper abdomen, the traditional four-chamber view, the five-chamber view in which the aortic root is visualized, and the fourth transverse view revealing the bifurcation of the pulmonary arteries, and long-axis views of the outflow tracts and aortic arch. We recently proposed the three vessel and trachea (3VT) plane of insonation be added, to facilitate and expedite fetal heart evaluation. The (3VT) is the most cephalad transverse view, visualized on a plane crossing the fetal upper mediastinum. It is obtained easily by moving the transducer cephalad and slightly oblique from the FCV, and shows the main pulmonary trunk (MPA) in direct communication with the ductus arteriosus (DA). A transverse section of the aortic arch is seen to the right of the MPA and DA. Cross sections of the superior vena cava (SVC), and posterior to it the trachea, are visualized. The clinical applicability of the 3VT was demonstrated in a recent study encompassing 1263 low-and high-risk cases scanned between 14 and 24?weeks' gestation. We consider one of the greatest advantages of our novel approach the ease with which the examiner can scan the fetal heart, beginning with the caudal upper-abdomen view. By sliding the transducer cephalad in one continuous motion, all the pertinent views are readily visualized. It was also shown to be effective in the diagnosis of such aortic arch anomalies as right and double aortic arch, among others. We showed that five short axis views including the 3VT simplified and streamlined fetal cardiac examination, without compromising diagnostic effectiveness.

AB  - Spectral Doppler velocimetry supported by directional color Doppler imaging became the method of choice for recording blood velocity signals from the maternal uterine arteries during the third trimester of gestation. Normally, the uterine artery waveforms show a high proportion of diastolic flow without any early diastolic notch and with a low resistance (RI) or pulsatility (PI) index. With increasing gestation, there is a slight decrease in the resistance to flow in the placental circulation. The placental side of the uterus shows lower values of the waveform indices than the nonplacental. In high-risk pregnancies, the abnormally high PI or the presence of notch is predictive of the adverse outcome of pregnancy. Recently, a Uterine Artery Score (UAS) has been presented based on a combined evaluation of RI and notch (Sekizuka et al., J Mat Fet Invest 1997; 7:?197). We have modified this approach, using PI and a uniform cut-off value for definition of the abnormal PI, disregarding the placenta location. The modified UAS in combination with the umbilical artery Blood Flow Classes possess a high predictive value with regard to the perinatal outcome in high-risk pregnancies, especially in those with placental hemodynamic dysfunction. In cases of intrauterine growth restriction, the combined examination of the uterine and umbilical circulation improves the clinical value of the third trimester Doppler velocimetry.

AB  - The aim of this study is to retrospectively evaluate the complications, safety and accuracy of midtrimester amniocentesis (MTAcz) in multiple pregnancy (MP). The indications and complications of MTAcz are the same for singleton pregnancies (SP) and MP, but what's different is the technique of the procedure and frequency of complications. Various techniques are here quoted, the purpose of which is to prove that samples have been taken from separate sacs. In general, the efficacy in amniotic fluid collection is 92?98%, and 95.6% in autors' cases. The number of insertion needles may have the influence on the abortion rate, but the opposite opinion also exists. The rate of spontaneous abortions has been analysed retrospectively in a group of SP with and without amniocentesis. The same parameters were also evaluated for MP. The risk of spontaneous abortions following MTAcz is nearly 2.5 times higher in MP (1.7% vs. 3.89%) than in SP, but is still within the range of normally elevated biological risk (4.5%) of this group of subjects.
