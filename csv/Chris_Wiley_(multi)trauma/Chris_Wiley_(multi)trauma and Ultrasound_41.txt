AB  - Background The study of fetal and placental circulation has focused on the interaction betweens fetal hypoxia and abnormal flow regulation. The assessed methods including spectral and color Doppler US. However, their uses in the depiction of angioarchitecture to make the specific diagnosis are limited. Methods We use three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler sonography (Voluson 530D, Medison; and HDI 3000, ATL) a to detect and visualize the fetal vasculature since 8?weeks gestation. We also use the same method to render the angioarchitecture of placenta as early as 5?weeks gestation. The scanning methods were using either free-handed or built-in mechanical probe. We also assess its application in decision making for difficult cases. Results Power Doppler provides excellent visualization of fetal circulation (including umbilical vein, portal vein systems, ductus venosus, hepatic veins, etc.). Furthermore, these data can be rendered in 3D perspectives, which is more comprehensive for understanding the complicated vasculature of fetus. It can correlates the embryonic findings in vivo, therefore can confirm the normalcy and also contribute in the diagnosis of pathological state. Conclusion Our results indicate 3D power Doppler is a promising tool in evaluation of complicated fetal and placental anatomy, and might help to make decision in clinical dilemmas.

AB  - Background The aims of this study were to assess the activity of the human fetal atrial natriuretic peptide system in hypertensive pregnancies with and without signs of increased fetal systemic venous pressure and to investigate the association between severe placental insufficiency and fetal myocardial cell destruction. Method Control group consisted of 50 newborns with uncomplicated pregnancy and labor. In group 1, 22 newborns after hypertensive pregnancies were included. Doppler ultrasonography revealed abnormal umbilical artery (UA) blood velocity waveform in five cases, and normal nonpulsatile umbilical vein (UV) blood velocity profile in every case. Group 2 consisted of five newborns after pregnancies complicated by maternal hypertensive disorder. Atrial pulsations in the UV and retrograde diastolic blood velocity pattern in the UA were detected in every case. Immediately after birth blood samples were collected from the UA and plasma N-terminal peptide of proatrial natriuretic peptide (NT-proANP) and serum cardiac specific troponin-T concentrations were measured. Results In group 1, nt-proANP concentrations were higher (P?<?0.001) than in the control group. In group 1, newborns with abnormal UA blood velocity pattern had higher (P?<?0.006) NT-proANP concentrations than newborns with normal UA Doppler findings. Troponin-T concentrations in group 1 did not differ from the control group. In group 2, NT-proANP (P?<?0.002) and troponin-T (P?<?0.0001) concentrations were higher than in the control group and study group 1. Conclusion Maternal hypertensive disorder stimulates fetal atrial natriuretic peptide production, being greatest in fetuses with severe placental insufficiency and a rise in systemic venous pressure. These fetuses also have evidence of myocardial cell destruction.

AB  - Background The aim of the study was a retrospective analysis of fetal heart disproportion. Method From the database of 3941 fetuses disproportion based on 4 chamber view was diagnosed in 136 fetuses (3.5%). There were 96 fetuses with the complete neonatal follow-up. Results Fifty-nine fetuses presented with different extracardiac malformations. Three other fetuses presented with heart defects. Thirty-four fetuses with disproportion had ?normal heart anatomy? and no extracardiac malformations. Gestational age at the time of diagnosis was 26?40?weeks (mean 35). Out of 34 fetuses with ?pure? disproportion, 15 cases (44%) did not have any clinical or postnatal ECH0 abnormalities. In 19 cases (54%) structural or functional abnormalities were found: 6 neonates presented with ASD secundum, 4 with CoA, 2 with lungs abnormalities (cong. pneumonia and cong. lung emphysema), one neonate had PDA, one had aorto-pulmonary window +?PDA. In other 5 neonates tricuspid insuffciency was diagnosed. Conclusions Disproportion in fetal heart was the relatively frequent abnormality at the referral center for fetal echocardiography (3.5%) and in majority of cases it was related to the presence of structural or functional abnormalities. In 44% of neonates fetal disproportion had no clinical implications. The most common neonatal heart defect in cases who prenatally presented with disproportion was ASD?sac, followed by CoA (4/19, 21%).

AB  - Background Vesicoamniotic shunting may be difficult or impossible in selected cases of fetal lower obstructive uropathy (LOU). The purpose of this paper is to describe the performance of fetal hydrolaparoscopy (FHL) and endoscopic fetal cystotomy (EFC) in fetuses with complicated LOU. Method FHL-EFC was performed in one patient with a markedly thickened bladder that could not be entered percutaneously. A peritoneoamniotic shunt was also placed. FHL-EFC was performed in a second patient with a collapsed bladder from a previous vesicocentesis, as vesicoinfusion resulted in further ascites. Fetal cystoscopy was performed after EFC, and posterior urethral valves were ablated with YAG-laser. A vesicoamniotic shunt was inserted. Results Adequate bladder drainage was obtained in both cases. The first baby required bilateral nephrostomies and a permanent cystotomy at birth, and is scheduled for a bladder expansion procedure at one year of age. The second patient had premature rupture of membranes and fetal demise from treatment of this complication 5?days after the original procedure. Conclusion FHL-EFC can be performed in complicated LOU cases. The procedure involves the creation of a defect in the bladder dome under direct endoscopic visualization within a hydroperitoneum. Peritoneo or vesicoamniotic shunting, or ablation of posterior urethral valves may then be performed. FHL-EFC should be reserved only for complicated cases of LOU where conventional vesicoamniotic shunting is not possible.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether a systematic stream-lined approach could be routinely used in the evaluation of the fetal intracranal anatomy, and which could be used to effectively and efficiently exclude all major intracranial malformation. Three planes were determined to be independent without overlay. Following the establishment of these three independent oblique planes across the intracranial anatomy, there were applied clinically to determine whether such planes would be sufficient to diagnose the major intracranial abnormalities. After retrospectively examining the various imaging levels taken, it was independently determined that three levels of intracranial imaging provided the greatest anatomic view of the entire fetal brain: the lateral ventricular level (Level I); the medial-thalamic level (Level II); and the inferior-posterior fossa view (Level III). We examined 131 cases of intracranial abnormalities that were prenatally diagnosed between 14 and 24?weeks gestation. One investigator was given the three-level view protocol to determine if the anomalies could be identified using this system. It was determined that, of the 131 abnormal cases, 126 (96.2%) were diagnosed using Levels I, II or III, independently or in combination. There were no false-positive test results. The present study investigated the efficacy of a three level view (TLV) imaging of the fetal brain representing a complete 2-D examination. We found this approach to be applicable throughout pregnancy and suitable for visualization of normal intracranial structures as well as the identification of abnormalities.

AB  - Color Doppler imaging and pulsed Doppler spectral analysis ultrasonography were used to scan 44 patients with an overt ovarian mass immediately before laparotomy. Sections of malignant tumors were analyzed for the cellular expression of TP and the intratumoral density of microvessels by immunohistochemistry using antibodies to TP and Factor VIII related antigen, respectively. Moreover, apoptotic index (AI) was evaluated by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling methods. The proportion of Stage I tumors that was TP positive (16%) was significantly lower (P?=?0.022) that the corresponding value for Stages II?IV (44%), although the values for microvessel count, AI, and peak systolic velocity (PSV) were similar. AI was significantly lower in TP-positive tumors than that in TP-negative tumors (P?=?0.015). The PSV was significantly higher in TP-positive tumors (P?=?0.02). There was a significant correlation between the microvessel count and the PSV (r?=?0.34, P?=?0.024). Moreover, AI was significantly inversely related to the PSV (r?=?0.35, P?=?0.023). The PSV in a subgroup with a high microvessel count and low AI was significantly higher than that in a subgroup with a low microvessel count and high AI (P?=?0.0006). These findings significantly associated with TP expression (P?=?0.024). The intratumoral PSV, as determined by color Doppler imaging and spectral analysis might reflect the coordination of angiogenesis and apoptosis, associating with TP expression in epithelial ovarian cancer.

AB  - Objective To measure peripheral pulmonary artery (PPA) and pulmonary vein (PV) velocity waveforms in growth restricted fetuses (IUGR) and to relate them to different Doppler indices fetal circulation and to pregnancy outcome. Design and methods 108 IUGR fetuses from singleton pregnancies (gestational age median 28.4 range 25?32) were prospectively considered for this study. Entry criteria were an ultrasonographic extimated fetal weight <?5th centile, the absence of structural and chromosomal abnormalities, and a Pulsatility Index (PI) in umbilical artery >?95th centile of our reference limits for gestation. Velocity waveforms were recorded from the PPA and in one of the PV in proximity of the inflow in the left atrium. The PI from PPA and the Pulsatility Index for the vein from PV (PIV?=?[S???D]/m) were calculated. Values obtained were compared to our reference limits for gestation and related to other Doppler indices from arterial, cardiac and systemic venous circulation and to fetal outcome. Results In IUGR fetuses both the PI from PPA (P?<?0.001) and the PIV from the PV (P?<?0.001) were increased when compared to control fetuses. An inverse relationship was found between PPA and middle cerebral artery PI. Changes in PV were present when abnormal velocity waveforms are present in the systemic venous circulation. Reverse flow during atrial contraction is present in pulmonary vein in the most severely compromised fetuses and are associated with fetal distress and imminent fetal death. Conclusions Abnormalities in arterial and pulmonary flows are present in IUGR fetuses. Changes in arterial circulation occur at an early stage of the disease while modifications in venous flows occurs later and may be the expression of an impaired function of the left ventricle close to fetal jeopardize.

AB  - Background The aim is to clarify placental shunt flow patterns in monochorionic diamniotic (MD) twins and their clinical outcome after the intervention under unique criteria. Method Thirteen (13) MD twin pregnancies were studied from early pregnancy with 2D and 3D B-mode, color Doppler, power-angio mode, Doppler flow velocimetry, cardio-thoraxarea ratio (CTAR) and preload index (PLI) under tocolysis. Results Artery to artery shunt flow was detected by fetalbeat-to-beat Doppler color change and cyclic bidirectionalflow at placental surface in 8?MD twin cases but not in 5. Shunt was more clear with 3D color Doppler and power-angio. Umbilical vein flow pulsation, variable FHR deceleration andcord complications were more in placental shunt flow casesthan its absence. Deep shunt flow was prenatally detected in 2 cases and small anastomses in all postnatal placenta. Pregnancy was terminated by emergency C-section in cases of uncontrollable contractions, unidirectional shunt flow, large CTAR and PLI (>?0.4) which were frequent in large twins after 30?weeks. Neonatal cardiac failure was more in shunt flow cases than its absence but the outcome was normal. Neonatal PVL and perinatal deaths were less than the MD twins in the past.

AB  - The incidence of fetal malformation is higher in multifetal pregnancies than in singletons. In a dizygotic twin gestation there is slightly more than twice the risk per pregnancy of a fetal malformation. In a monozygotic twin gestation the rates of chromosomal and mendelian abnormalities are identical to those of a singleton pregnancy. However, there is an increased risk of structural malformations. Selective termination in a bichorionic biamniotic twin pregnancy is done with intracardiac injection of potassium chloride. The international experience show that it can be performed in all 3 trimesters with good outcomes in >?90% of cases and the loss rate is approximately 7%. In monochorionic twin gestation the aim is to arrest the umbilical cord flow completely and permanently. Several methods to achieve this goal are embolization, ligation (fetoscope of U/S guidance), laser coagulation, monopolar and bipolar thermocoagulation. The latter technique became more popular, with estimated loss rate of 20%. The techniques and results will be presented (including video), and the ethical issue will be discussed.

AB  - Background Reversed enddiastolic Doppler flow velocity waveforms on umbilical velocimetry is regarded to be associated with catastrophical perinatal outcome with a high perinatal mortality ranging from 35% to 100%. This study focused on the differences of fetal morbidity and mortality between the cases with reverse flow and other Doppler flow velocity waveforms. Method During a 10-year period we found 30 cases with reverse flow in the umbilical artery or fetal aorta (gr. I), we selected 30 cases with absent end diastolic velocities (gr. II), 30 cases with high A/B-ratio (gr. III) and 30 cases with normal A/B-ratio (gr. IV). All cases in this study were patients with similar para, gravida, maternal age and gestational ages by delivery (≤?36?weeks). Results The fetuses with reverse flow showed the highest perinatal mortality of 27% (7% in the gr. II, 10% in the gr. III and 0% in the gr. IV). In the gr. I the neonatal morbidity of 78% was also the highest (59% in the gr. II, 36% in the gr. III and 30% in the gr. IV). 80% of intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) were within this group, while no IUFD has been found in the gr. IV. Furthermore, the incidence of cerebral haemorrhage by the neonates in the gr. I (28%) was also much higher than those in the gr. III (4%) and IV (0%). Conclusions Our study suggests that reverse flow represents severe fetal condition with the highest perinatal mortalities. The fetal outcome in cases with reverse flow is further worse than those with absent end diastolic flow velocity waveforms. A highest morbidity was also observed by those fetuses, especially high incidences of cerebral haemorrhage. Colour Doppler-sonography is a very useful tool to identify high risk pregnancy leading worse perinatal outcome and allows to select worst perinatal prognosis if reverse end diastolic flow is detected.

AB  - ABSTRACT In this study, polybutyrolactam (PBA) was synthesized, and the PBA/chitosan (CS) blended films were fabricated for wound dressings. The results showed that the surface roughness of the blended films decreased with the increasing ratios of CS. In addition, the tensile strength of the film with 50 wt % CS (NC50) was about 33.6 MPa and the highest compared with other films. The hydrophilicity of the blended films gradually decreased while the water vapor transmission rates (WVTRs) increased with the increase of CS content. Moreover, the blended films could be biodegradable in phosphate buffer saline. Both PBA and blended films were non-toxic and good for L929 cells growth, showing good cytocompatibility. Furthermore, the NC50 was found to promote the cell proliferation better than other groups. It can be suggested that the NC50 combined the advantages of both PBA and CS well. Therefore, the NC50 with good cytocompatibility, mechanical properties, and WVTRs might be suitable for wound dressing applications. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

AB  - Traditionally, the prenatal assessment of the umbilical cord (UC) is limited to the assessment of the number of vessels and to the evaluation of umbilical artery blood flow parameters. Morphologic aspects of the UC have usually been studied by pathologists and retrospectively correlated with the perinatal outcome. The introduction of more sophisticated imaging techniques have offered the possibility to investigate the UC characteristics during fetal life from early to late gestation. A number of investigations have demonstrated that an altered structure of the UC can be associated with pathologic conditions (i.e. preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, diabetes, fetal demise). Nomograms of the various UC components have been generated and allow the identification of lean or large umbilical cords, entities frequently associated with fetal growth abnormalities and diabetes, respectively. Of note, lean UC in the second and third trimester differs from normal UC not only from a structural point of view but also in the umbilical vein blood flow characteristics. On the other hand a thin UC in the first trimester seems to be a marker for identifying a subset of fetuses at risk for spontaneous abortion and pre-eclampsia. A Wharton's jelly reduction has also been invoked as a possible cause of fetal death in the presence of single umbilical artery. Prenatal morphometric and morphologic UC characteristics as well as UC arterial and venous blood flow parameters in normal and pathologic conditions will be presented and discussed.

AB  - Background Intracardiac echogenic foci are controversially discussed whether or not they are marker for chromosomal aberrations. The possible association with fetal congenital heart defects (CHD) and its impact were not yet analyzed extensively. Method During 30?months, prenatally detected structural CHD were prospectively analyzed for the presence of EF. Frequency, localization, number, association with chromosomal defects and pattern of CHD were assessed. Results 279 fetal CHD could be examined and EF were found in 31 cases (11.1%). The localization was in 17 cases (54%) the left, in 7 (22%) the right, and in 7 (22.5%) both ventricles. Multiple EF were found in 10 cases. 14 cases (42%) were associated with a chromosomal aberration (T18 n?=?2; T21 n?=?5, T13 n?=?3, Triploidy n?=?2, Del22q n?=?1, others n?=?1). Among the remaining 17 fetuses with normal chromosomes following heart defects were found: 3???VSD, 3???Left-persistent SVC, 2???TGA, 2???TOF, 2???Coarctation, and 1???PS, PA, Ebstein, TAC, AS each. Conclusions Compared to low-risk groups EF are more frequent in the presence of CHD and show another distribution involving more right ventricular or bilateral EF. The combination of EF and CHD is highly associated with aneuploidies. Since associated CHD include also conotruncal anomalies EF can be considered as an indication for targeted fetal echocardiography especially when EF is localized in the RV or in both ventricles.

AB  - Background Fetal growth is determined by its genetic potential and growth support. The aim of our prospective study was to find out does the growth support (placental factor and blood flow) or genetic potential play a primary role in fetal growth. Method From 27 to 41 gestational weeks an umbilical artery (RI1), a middle cerebral artery resistance index (RI2) and umbilical-cerebral (U/C) ratio were measured. Several US measurements in 3?4?week intervals of the same pregnancy were done. After delivery, fetuses were divided into the three groups (AGA, LGA, SGA) according to their birth-weights. Pregnancies with gestational diabetes were excluded from the study. Results There were not statistically significant differences between the average values of RI1 (age related) in the groups of AGA and LGA fetuses. However, the mean values of RI1 (according to gestational age) in the mentioned two groups of fetuses were significantly lower than in the group of SGA fetuses, as well as their mean values of U/C ratios. Conclusion Placental factor is equally and efficiently functioning in the both groups of AGA and LGA fetuses. The genetic regulating factor of fetal growth can be adequately expressed in conditions of appropriate uteroplacental and umbilical blood supply. In other words, in identical or at least similar conditions of umbilical blood supply, fetal growth is exclusively influenced by its genetic potential.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is now defined as a condition in which the fetus does not reach the optimal condition of his growth. In this situation the birthweight can be reduced below the 10th percentile or can be superior to that threshold especially when the restriction took first place in late part of the pregnancy. Therefore it is possible to identify two groups of IUGR according to the intrauterine observation and the birthweight assessment: SGA and AGA IUGR. The most important complication of IUGR is represented by the hypoxaemia caused by placental vasculopathy. Hypoxaemia is present in about 30% of IUGR fetuses with not significant difference between SGA and AGA IUGR cases, and is the major cause of the poor perinatal outcome. After recognition of the growth restriction it is necessary to apply second level tests in order to assess the presence or absence of hypoxaemia. When hypoxaemia is present the first mechanism of fetal adaptation is represented by the redistribution of the circulation. This phenomenon is easily observable by using Doppler technology. When applying the same technique on the umbilical arteries it is possible to detect an increase in the peripheral resistance proportional to the obliteration of the placental vascular bed that is the cause of the fetal hypoxaemia. By using the information offered by Doppler study on fetal and umbilical vessels it is therefore possible to optimize the clinical management of the IUGR fetuses.

AB  - Objective The 3D Color Histogram gives quantitative informations about (changes) of perfusion and vascularisation packed in indices. Aim of the presentation is to illustrate the information gained by the vascularisation and perfusion indices. In addition, to show the reproducibility of the indices according to published studies, preliminary results (transvaginal) obtained in ovarian tumors and preliminary results in phantom measurements to correct the decrease in signal power with depth of insonation using a 3D abdominal probe. Results Color Histogram indices are reproducible. Differences of perfusion and vascularisation between benign and malignant ovarian tumors could be observed in a limited number of investigations. The physical component of the decrease in signal power with depth of insonation could be calculated by mathematical algorythms according to first phantom measurements. Conclusion The 3D Color Histogram gives new possibilities to analyse neoangiogenesis.

AB  - Aim To assess agreement between fetal cord blood Hb concentration by Doppler velocimetry and a formula (Oepkes et al, Br J Obstet Gynaecol 1994; 101:680?4), and the actual Hb concentration by cord blood sampling. Material and methods A prospective cohort of 31 Rh isoimmunised fetuses undergoing Doppler cord blood velocity measurements within the 24 hs previous to cordocentesis or delivery was included. Mean aortic velocity at descent fetal aorta and maximum umbilical vein flow at intrahepatic portion were measured blindly by a single operator with pulsed Doppler and a 3.5 Mhz transducer. Cord Hb was the gold standard. Abnormality and normality were defined as a Hb level lower and higher, respectively, than the cut-off point (<7, <8, <9, <10, <11 and <12 g/dL were tested). Likelihood ratio was also calculated. Results Interval between Doppler study and cordocentesis/delivery was 24?48 hs. Fetal blood sampling was performed by cordocentesis in 4 cases, following a C-section in 24, and following vaginal delivery in 3. 1 Distribution of cases according to results obtained (n cases) Cut-off point <7g <8g <9g <10g <11g <12g True+ 1 5 7 14 23 26 False+ 1 1 7 7 6 5 True? 29 25 15 7 2 0 False? 0 0 2 3 0 0 2 (abstract WS15-07) Agreement at different cut-off points in the diagnosis of abnormality and normality [point estimate (CI)] Cut-off <7 <8 <9 <10 <11 <12 Abn. 50(5?100) 83(36?99) 43(21?69) 58(37?77) 79(60?91) 84(66?94) Norm. 97(81?100) 96(78?100) 62(41?80) 41(17?67) 25(4?64) 0(0?54) LR 30(2.3?129.8) 26(4.2?132.4) 2.7(1.2?5.9) 1.6(1?3) 1.3(1?2.4) 1(0.9?2) Conclusion An acceptable agreement was found.

AB  - Menopause is associated with an increase in the incidence of ischemic heart disease and stroke. Loss of ovarian function is characterized by significantly high values of blood and plasma viscosity. After the menopause, thromboxane production increases and correlates with duration of menopause. Large studies have shown that postmenopausal HRT is associated with reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease. The aim of the study was to evaluate the plasma thromboxane and plasma viscosity in relation with Doppler flow parameters in postmenopausal patients treated with HRT. Thirty-two postmenopausal (FSH?>?40 UI/L and estradiol <?100?pmol/L) women (mean age?±?SD, 54.7?±?2.9?years) participated in the study and were submitted to continuous estradiol transdermal supplementation and 12-day courses of medroxyprogesterone acetate every second month. Doppler resistances at the level of uterine and internal carotid arteries, thromboxane plasma levels and plasma viscosity were analyzed in basal condition and after 1, 3 and 6?months. During hormone supplementation, the pulsatility index significantly decreased at the level of analyzed arteries. Similarly, plasma thromboxane levels and plasma viscosity were significantly reduced. Significant correlations were found between thromboxane plasma concentrations, plasma viscosity and uterine artery resistances. Thus HRT seems to be responsible for both direct and indirect modifications at the level of the vessel wall physiology.

AB  - Background To investigate the effects of combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the vascular impedance of the uterine, inferior vesicle and ophtalmic artery. Method Thirty-five postmenopausal patients were analysed in basal condition and during a HRT phase at 1, 3 and 6?months. Patients were divided in two groups: 21 patients whose last menstrual bleeding was 1?5?years ago, and 14 patients with the duration of menopause >?6?years. Color Doppler analysis of the blood flow impedance was performed at the level of the uterine, inferior vesicle and ophtalmic artery. Estradiol plasma concentrations were assayed on the day of Doppler examinations. Results The analysis of the uterine and inferior vesicle artery flow velocities demonstrated significant positive correlations between resistance index (RI) and years of menopause; higher impedance values were obtained in patients with longer interval from last menstrual bleeding (P?<?0.05). The impedance in patients with >?6?years duration of menopause was 0.94?±?0.03 vs., 0.89?±?0.04, in the group of patients with 1?5?years duration of menopause for uterine artery, and for inferior vesicle artery (0.91?±?0.04 vs. 0.98?±?0.02). No significant correlation between baseline RI and time since menopause was noticed (0.72 vs. 0.73, respectively, P?>?0.05) at the level of ophtalmic artery. After six months of HRT plasma estradiol levels inversely correlated with RI uterine (r?=??0.2556; P?=?0.021), inferior vesicle (R?=??0.2653; P?=?0.023) and opthalmic (r?=??0.2211; P?=?0.017) arteries. Conclusion Doppler studies of uterine, inferior vesicle, and ophtalmic artery can provide specific and precise pathophysiological information to assess blood flow variations in correlation with combined HRT administration.

AB  - Background This study was conducted to assess uterine blood flow characteristics in endometrial cancer and to evaluate the influence of myometrial invasion and cancer grading for uterine circulation. Method Transvaginal color doppler was performed on 97 women with endometrial cancer (11 in stage IA, 33 in stage IB, 37 in stage IC, 7 in stage II, 8 in stage III, and 1 in stage IV) and 51 asymptomatic postmenopausal women (control group). Intratumoral and main uterine artery blood flow was recorded and the peak systolic velocity (PSV) and impedance indices (RI, PI) were calculated. Results In 90 of the 97 postmenopausal endometrial cancer patients (92%) abnormal blood flow with low impedance levels (RI: 0.39?±?0.08; PI: 0.51?±?0.15) was found within the endometrial echo or very close to it. Impedance indices in the main uterine arteries were significantly (P?<?0005) lower in women with endometrial cancer than in normal postmenopausal woman. Uterine blood flow was not modified by the cancer grading. There was, no difference in impedance indices of the uterine arteries between myometrial invasion of <?50% and >?50%. Conclusion These results suggest that uterine blood flow analysis in endometrial cancer could not predict the tumor staging and grading, but this examination can provide additional discriminatory information on tumor vascularity which can then be used with morphology for more accurate diagnosis.
