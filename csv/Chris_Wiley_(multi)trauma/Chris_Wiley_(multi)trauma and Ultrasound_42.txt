AB  - Objective To assess long-term neuodevelopmental outcome and structural reorganisation of children suffering hypoxic-ischemic (H-I) and/or haemorrhagic perinatal brain damage; To test the hypothesis of more successful recovery of prematures and/or unilateral lesions after perinatal brain damage; To estimate prenatal events, in particularly value of pathological findings of Color Doppler (CD) in the pathogenesis of perinatal brain damage; Study design 68 children suffering perinatal brain H-I (10) and/or haemorrhagic lesions (58) diagnosed by ultrasonography (US) underwent neurologic and psycho-linguistic examinations by age 16. High resolution 2 T MRI was used to assess structural reorganisation; 20 children suffering unilateral perinatal brain damage (MCA infarct.) were followed up (neurodevelopmentally, transcranial CD and US/CT, MRI); 25 children with CD findings (C/U ratio <?1) during pregnancy underwent prospective follow-up postnatally by age 2. Results All children with H-I lesions have still at age 16 one or more severe handicaps, while 39 children with mild grade of hemorrhage had minor neurological dysfunction, 15 were normal. MRI revealed destructive and/or atrophic lesions in all children with H-I lesions and mild atrophy and/or signs of preiventricular haemorrhage in rest children. 20 children with unilateral perinatal brain damage have contralateral hemiparesis and various accompanying neurodevelopmental disorders. There were no strict correlation between size, site, hemispheral involvement gestational age and neurodevelopmental outcome of children examined. Out of the 25 children having pathological CD findings during pregnancy, 7 revealed mild grade (I?II) of peri-intraventricular haemorrhage, 10 children isolated or combined H-I and haemorrhagic lesion, 7 children have no apparent perinatal brain damage. Short-term neuro-developmental outcome revealed mild delay and/or disorders in 10 infants and in the rest normal status.

AB  - Background To evaluate the preoperative clinical, laboratory and sonographic characteristics of struma ovarii. Method A retrospective review of gynecologic patients operated for mature cystic teratoma over a 10-year period, identified 16 cases of struma ovarii. These cases were the subject of this study and were compared to 32 cases of ovarian dermoid cysts. Results The incidence of struma ovarii among all cases of dermoid cysts was 4.8%. Most patients were menopausal, the mean lesion diameter was 57.3?mm, occurred more frequently (68.8%) in the right adnexa and presented with normal CA-125 level. Blood flow signals were detected from the center of the lesions in all cases. Rare cases presented with elevated tumor marker and low-resistance blood flow. In dermoid cycsts, blood flow had a higher resistive index. In addition, no blood flow could be detected from the center of the echogenic lesion in dermoid (P?<?0.0001). Conclusion It is difficult to distinguish between struma ovarii and dermoid cysts, based on their sonographic appearance. Nevertheless, Doppler flow may aid in the preoperative diagnosis of struma ovarii. Blood flow signals, detected from the center of the echogenic lesions and low resistance to flow may be more common in struma ovarii.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a common symptom of many possible maternal-fetal pathologies and/or the expression of a genetic alteration; by far, the most common etiology is related to chronic fetal hypoxemia. Fetal hypoxemia may be the result of different feto-maternal pathophysiological processes which can produce completely different fetal hemodynamic modifications, not only in relation to the quality but particularly in relation to the chronology of the hemodynamic events. However, fetal hypoxia is mostly due to placental vascular insufficiency and it is important to point-out that fetal hypoxemia-acidemia is part of the terminal pathway starting from placental functional and structural alterations, through fetal IUGR, leading to intrauterine fetal death. Doppler evaluation of fetal arterial districts is important for the diagnosis of the fetal hemodynamic adaptation to the hypoxemia. Our observations suggest that, in the evaluation of fetal hemodynamics, it is important to consider also the intracardiac and the venous hemodynamics, focusing the study on the evaluation of the output tracts, the atrio-ventricular flow and on vessels like the ductus venosus, inferior vena cava, umbilical vein. Keeping the time of the hemodynamic alterations in these vessels and/or districts, which are characteristic signs of the incipient heart failure, may be one of the key for the solution for one of the main obstetrical problem: the diagnosis of fetal decompensation phase.

AB  - Background Three-dimensional imaging of superficial fetal abnormalities is well established. We prospectively evaluated if a technique of sectional planar imaging could interrogate nonsurface fetal abnormalities without changing transducers or requiring postrendering software. Method Patients referred for perinatal consultation received traditional 2-D scanning and simultaneous volume mode imaging. Fetal abnormalities were visualized with a sectional technique similar to ?tomogram? slices. No post image rendering manipulation was required. Twelve patients had correlative MRI scanning. Neonatal images were obtained when possible. Results Structural fetal abnormalities amenable to volume rendering were found in 192 of 600 referral patients. Of these, 49% (94/192) benefited from 3-D planar imaging. Consistently improved counseling occurred with abdominal wall defect (11/11), cystic hygroma (8/8), neural tube defect (8/8), skeletal dysplasia (5/5), hydrops (5/5), ovarian mass (4/4), myoma (9/11), and fetal chest mass (2/3). Moderate image concordance was seen for nuchal thickness (4/8), renal dysgenesis (27/50), and placental mass or separation (7/12). Lowest concordance was seen for echogenic bowel (0/17), isolated SUA (0/9), and CPC (4/41). Conclusion Complex syndromes with superficial and deep architecture are accessible with a simple volume mode planar scanning technique. The additional information is immediately available and useful in counseling of these syndromes.

AB  - Background The study of fetal and placental circulation has focused on the interaction betweens fetal hypoxia and abnormal flow regulation. The assessed methods including spectral and color Doppler US. However, their uses in the depiction of angioarchitecture to make the specific diagnosis are limited. Methods We use three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler sonography (Voluson 530D, Medison; and HDI 3000, ATL) a to detect and visualize the fetal vasculature since 8?weeks gestation. We also use the same method to render the angioarchitecture of placenta as early as 5?weeks gestation. The scanning methods were using either free-handed or built-in mechanical probe. We also assess its application in decision making for difficult cases. Results Power Doppler provides excellent visualization of fetal circulation (including umbilical vein, portal vein systems, ductus venosus, hepatic veins, etc.). Furthermore, these data can be rendered in 3D perspectives, which is more comprehensive for understanding the complicated vasculature of fetus. It can correlates the embryonic findings in vivo, therefore can confirm the normalcy and also contribute in the diagnosis of pathological state. Conclusion Our results indicate 3D power Doppler is a promising tool in evaluation of complicated fetal and placental anatomy, and might help to make decision in clinical dilemmas.

AB  - ABSTRACT In this study, polybutyrolactam (PBA) was synthesized, and the PBA/chitosan (CS) blended films were fabricated for wound dressings. The results showed that the surface roughness of the blended films decreased with the increasing ratios of CS. In addition, the tensile strength of the film with 50 wt % CS (NC50) was about 33.6 MPa and the highest compared with other films. The hydrophilicity of the blended films gradually decreased while the water vapor transmission rates (WVTRs) increased with the increase of CS content. Moreover, the blended films could be biodegradable in phosphate buffer saline. Both PBA and blended films were non-toxic and good for L929 cells growth, showing good cytocompatibility. Furthermore, the NC50 was found to promote the cell proliferation better than other groups. It can be suggested that the NC50 combined the advantages of both PBA and CS well. Therefore, the NC50 with good cytocompatibility, mechanical properties, and WVTRs might be suitable for wound dressing applications. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

AB  - Abstract A 6-year-old neutered male domestic short-haired cat was presented to the Comparative Ophthalmology service at Michigan State University with a 3-week history of decreased appetite and redness of the left eye. The left forelimb had been removed 15?months previously because of the presence of a subcutaneous fibrosarcoma. In the left globe, a large iridal mass was associated with increased intraocular pressure and retinal detachment. A smaller mass involving the right iris was also present. Imaging revealed a 2-cm mass in the left caudodorsal lung lobe, and abdominal ultrasound showed multifocal bilateral renal masses. Aspirates of these masses were nondiagnostic. The left globe was removed for palliative reasons, and histopathology showed that fibrosarcoma was infiltrating the iris, choroid, and optic nerve. Despite systemic chemotherapy with doxorubicin, the animal died 4?months after initial presentation. Histopathology confirmed highly angioinvasive metastatic fibrosarcoma also in the right uveal tract, the lungs, and both kidneys.

AB  - Abstract Objective To assess whether prenatal identification of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) fetuses would reduce the rates of the primary composite outcome of ?stillbirths and neonatal complications?, and secondary outcomes of stillbirth and low 5-min Apgar score. Methods This historical cohort study was conducted with women who had singleton delivery (≥ 32 weeks), in 247 French maternity units. Medical terminations of pregnancy, infants with malformations, and women with missing delivery data were excluded. Among the infants born SGA (<5thpercentile), we compared those who had been identified as such in utero (i.e. ?exposed group?) (n=5,093) with those who had not (i.e. ?non-exposed group?) (n=19,853). The main endpoint was a composite variable defined as stillbirth or death in the delivery room, or transfer to a neonatal intensive care unit (NCIU). The secondary outcomes were stillbirth and 5-min Apgar score. Results Mean birthweight in the cohort was 2449.1 ± 368.3 g. The adjusted Relative Risk (aRR) for the main composite outcome was 1.29 (95%CI: 1.21-1.38) in the group identified prenatally as SGA compared with non-identified SGA fetuses (39.5% vs. 13.5%). In the subgroups, i.e. ≥37-<40 weeks and ≥40 weeks, prenatal identification of SGA fetuses improved this main outcome. The stillbirth rate was reduced for fetuses with prenatal suspicion of SGA (aRR=0.47; 95%CI: 0.27-0.79). The 5-min. Apgar score did not differ between the 2 groups. The a posteriori study power with α=0.05 was 99%. Conclusions Among children born SGA, prenatal identification did not improve, globally, fetal and neonatal issues; however, it reduced stillbirth.

Ultrasound examination showed hypomotile, fluid-distended small intestines, and thrombosed jejunal veins. Multiphasic contrast-enhanced computed tomography was performed and showed a CT ?whirl sign,? an important but nonspecific sign of intestinal volvulus in human patients. At surgery, the majority of the small intestine was entangled in the volvulus and showed black discoloration. The patient was euthanized. Postmortem evaluation yielded a diagnosis of jejunoileal mesenteric volvulus secondary to a congenital omphalomesenteric duct remnant.

AB  - Summary Primary care guidelines provide a reference point to guide clinicians based on a systematic review of the literature, contextualised by expert clinical opinion. These guidelines develop a modification of the GRADE framework for assessment of research evidence (vetGRADE) and applied this to a range of clinical scenarios regarding use of analgesic agents. Key guidelines produced by the panel included recommendations that horses undergoing routine castration should receive intratesticular local anaesthesia irrespective of methods adopted and that horses should receive NSAIDs prior to surgery (overall certainty levels high). Butorphanol and buprenorphine should not be considered appropriate as sole analgesic for such procedures (high certainty). The panel recommend the continuation of analgesia for 3 days following castration (moderate certainty) and conclude that phenylbutazone provided superior analgesia to meloxicam and firocoxib for hoof pain/laminitis (moderate certainty), but that enhanced efficacy has not been demonstrated for joint pain. In horses with colic, flunixin and firocoxib are considered to provide more effective analgesia than meloxicam or phenylbutazone (moderate certainty). Given the risk of adverse events of all classes of analgesic, these agents should be used only under the control of a veterinary surgeon who has fully evaluated a horse and developed a therapeutic, analgesic plan that includes ongoing monitoring for such adverse events such as the development of right dorsal colitis with all classes of NSAID and spontaneous locomotor activity and potentially ileus with opiates. Finally, the panel call for the development of a single properly validated composite pain score for horses to allow accurate comparisons between medications in a robust manner.

AB  - Abstract Purpose To report the anatomical pattern and etiological spectrum of uveitis in an urban multi-ethnic population from Barcelona, Spain. General and specific epidemiological data for the most prevalent aetiologies are also calculated. Methods A cross-sectional study of consecutive uveitis cases was performed between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2012. Exogenous endophthalmitis, surgery-related, post-traumatic and toxic uveitis along with masquerade syndromes were excluded. Anatomical (Standard Uveitis Nomenclature criteria) and aetiological patterns (by tailored tests), age, sex, geographical origin and laterality were analysed. Mean incidence and prevalence were calculated for a mid-period reference population. Results From 1022 patients included, 52% were anterior uveitis (AU), 23% posterior, 15% panuveitis and 9% intermediate uveitis. Aetiologically, 26% were unclassifiable, 29% infectious, 25% associated with systemic immune diseases, and 20% corresponded to ocular-specific syndromes. Among classified causes, herpesvirus (12%), toxoplasma (7%), Behçet's disease (BD) (5%), HLA-B27-isolated AU (5%), ankylosing spondylitis (5%), tuberculosis-related uveitis (TRU) (5%), birdshot chorioretinopathy (3%) and sarcoidosis (3%) were the most frequent. Non-Spanish origin was recorded in 22%, with 47% of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada and 36% of toxoplasma cases coming from South America, 10% of BD and 11% of TRU from Africa and 24% of TRU cases from Asia. A mean annual incidence of 51.91 cases/100 000 inhabitants was found for the referral population. Conclusion In our referral area, 74% of the uveitis cases can be correctly classified. A large myriad of uveitis aetiologies with a strong geographical origin burden are found in Western urban multi-ethnic populations.

AB  - Summary Chronic venous disease is a common disorder associated with a variety of symptoms in later disease stages but also with complications such as venous leg ulcer. This, in turn, has substantial socioeconomic effects and significantly impacts patients? quality of life. While there are a number of diagnostic procedures available, color-flow duplex ultrasound has become the gold standard. As regards therapeutic options, major advances have been made in recent decades. Today, there are alternatives to saphenofemoral ligation and stripping of the great saphenous vein, including endovenous thermal ablation techniques. However, treatment selection continues to depend on many factors such as individual anatomical circumstances and disease stage. The following article provides an overview of the anatomy and pathophysiology as well as current diagnostic and therapeutic standards.

AB  - Doppler velocimetry give possibility of making noninvasive evaluation of the vascular modifications from the beginning of pregnancy. We have studied following vessels: Retrocorial arteries The flow increases since sixth to twelfth weeks, progressively which is explained by the increment of the conductancy and the reduction of resistance. Trophoblastic invasion of spirals arteries in the coral bed, and hormones produced during the gestation affect both values. Uterine arteries The resistance of the uterine arteries diminish since sixth to twelfth weeks, in normal pregnancy. The low increment depends on the modifications in the coral bed and of hormonal vasodilator effect. OVF Luteum gravidicus When ovary flow is greater in first stage of pregnancy suggest a favorable early gestation, and vice versa, a regress in those measures had a negative character. We could evaluate the role of Doppler examinations in the following situations: ? Abortion in any stage and variations ? Blighted ovum ? Ectopic pregnancy In all these conditions, Doppler showed to be a trusty, predictive, prognostical and diagnostical instrument of great utility. Clinical application of Doppler Uterus Corial could be used in a preventive way when the increment of the resistance in the uterine arteries appears before clinical abortion symptoms. We also applied Doppler exploration in AVF patients confirming that the deficit in uterine perfusion is significantly related with the failures in embryonary implantation. Recently, we are performing endovaginal color Doppler in the diagnoses of early ectopic gestation and trophoblastic disease with very satisfactory results.

AB  - Subacute or chronic fetal hypoxia is associated with an increase in fetal erythropoietin (EPO) synthesis irrespective of the etiology of hypoxia. Amniotic fluid (AF) EPO level is often elevated in diabetic pregnancies (especially in macrosomic fetuses), and in pregnancies complicated by hypertension (HT), pre-eclampsia (PE) or/and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). It is shown that cerebro-umbilical arterial flow ratio (RIC/RIU) is often abnormal (less than 1) in the case of fetal hypoxia. We studied AF EPO levels in 29 diabetic pregnancies, 18 pregnancies with HT, PE or/and IUGR and 19 healthy controls. The samples were obtained during the elective amniocenteses in the case of suspected fetal hypoxia or during caesarean sections. Doppler measurements were performed not more than 24?h before amniocenesis. AF EPO levels were significantly elevated in diabetics with abnormal fetal growth (either macrosomia or IUGR) and nondiabetics with HT, PE or/and IUGR as compared with healthy controls or diabetics with normal fetal growth. AF EPO levels of fetuses with normal fetal growth in diabetic mothers were not different from those of healthy controls. There was no correlation between AF EPO levels and RIC/RIU in any of the diabetic or nondiabetic group. However, 5 fetuses had either absent end-diastolic or reversed umbilical flow. All had elevated AF EPO levels (range 16?15?800?mU/ml). We conclude that both fetal macrosomia and IUGR in diabetic pregnancies seem to cause chronic fetal hypoxia. Normal fetal growth in diabetic pregnancies is not associated with chronic fetal hypoxia. Single measurement of RIC/RIU is of little value in the diagnosis of chronic fetal hypoxia in abnormal pregnancies.

AB  - Objective Treatment of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy is complicated by the lack of readily available measures of the fetal thyroid status. Both hyper- and hypo-thyroidism of the fetus may have short and long-term detrimental effects and thus should be avoided. We therefore followed the fetal thyroidal size during treatment of maternal thyroid disorders and correlated the data with treatment and thyroidal status in the mother. Methods During 24-month period 20 patients with thyroid disorders were referred for serial fetal thyroid measurements. Thyroid size was measured by transvaginal ultrasonography between 14 and 17?weeks' of gestation and by abdominal ultrasonography between 18 and 38?weeks' gestation. Results In five women with Grave's diseases correlation between thionamide dosage and fetal thyroid size were noted. Two fetuses had an increase in the size of thyroid gland above the upper 95% confidence interval, one of them developed neonatal Grave's of which it was the only prenatal sign of fetal thyroid abnormalities. In all other three fetuses changes inthyroidal size aided in determining the dosage of the antithyroidal drugs. Conclusions Inutero ultrasonographic measurements of the fetal thyroid size can be used as a noninvasive tool for the proper management of maternal hyperthyroidism.

AB  - The color and Power Doppler gives us the opportunity to investigate the vascular anatomy as an angiography and furthermore lets us ?see? hydro jets. This singular ability leads us to make some diagnosis and confirm others. During this lecture we will show our experience in the diagnosis of some fetal anomalies such as renal agenesis, urachal cysts, megacystis microcolon Hypoperistalsis syndrome, renal displasia, Galeno vein aneurysm, anterior wall defects such as omphalocele and gastroschisis, diaphragmatic hernia, duodenal atresia, coartation of the aorta, single umbilical artery Dandy Walker Malformation, and some fetal tumors.

AB  - The regulation and significance of ovarian and uterine haemodynamics in human reproductive pathophysiology has been largely studied. In women, ovarian vascularization seems to be responsible for the selection and maturation of follicles both in spontaneous and stimulated IVF cycles while endometrial receptivity is related to uterine blood flow and implicated in the achievement of pregnancy. In patients who underwent to IVF cycles, the PI of both uterine and spiral arteries is significantly lower in patients who became pregnant in comparison with nonpregnant and is associated with significantly lower endometrial cell thromboxane concentrations than non pregnant patients. In poor responders women it has been demonstrated the role of l-arginine in improving uterine and follicular Doppler flow and in increasing ovarian response to gonadotrophin. Recently, in a total of 41 patients undergoing to assisted reproduction, an higher number of oocytes collected and embryos transferred was observed in normo-responders than in poor-responders patients. Furthermore follicular vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) resulted inversely correlated with retrieved oocytes (r?=??0.942; p?=?0.0017). In addition significant higher uterine and perifollicular Doppler flow resistances were observed in poor-responders women. The pregnancy rate/cycle was significantly higher in normo-responders (26%) than poor-responders (6%; p?=?0.037) patients. In conclusion, vasoactive substances improve ovarian response to gonadotrophin and allow a better management of ovarian stimulation in infertile patients.

AB  - Background Recent reports have shown a significantly improved survival for complex congenital heart disease (CHD) when detected antenatally. This has further substantiated the need to detect CHD in utero. Since the performance of the 4-chamber view as a screening tool is rather insufficient, the issue is now to find more effective and not too expensive alternative methods to reach this aim. Method The cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is an efficient method to assess health outcomes and resource costs of health interventions. We have applied this tool to prenatal detection of CHD, comparing 3 models: (1) 4-chamber view at level I; (2) outflow tracts at level I; (3) Outflow tracts at level II. To perform the analysis we have made the following assumptions: (1) the incidence of CHD at 20?weeks is 10/1000; (2) the percentage of severe CHD is 40%; (3) the monthly salary are 2500 USD and 3500 USD for level I and level II operators, respectively; (4) detection rate for CHD detectable on the 4-chamber view and on outflows only are 35%/20%, 60%/60%, and 90%/90% for the three options (level I 4-chamber, level I outflows, level II outflows). Results and conclusions Based on the forementioned assumptions, the costs for (1) a diagnosis of CHD; (2) a diagnosis of severe CHD; (3) TOP of any CHD; TOP of a severe CHD are reported below. These results, which were also submitted to sensitivity analyses, will be discussed. Costs Outcome Level I 4-ch. Level I ?Outflows Level II ?Outflows Det. Any CHD 1796 USD 1157 USD 324 USD Det Severe CHD 6510 USD 2894 USD 810 USD TOP Any CHD 5314 USD 2893 USD 810 USD TOP Severe CHD 9300 USD 4133 USD 1157 USD

AB  - Over a year I invited you here to participate to the rct for treating twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTS). Are there any data available to reconsider this? The answer is clearly no, on the contrary. Indeed large series on amniodrainage or laser therapy have become available. With serial amniodrainage overall survival for both twins is 49% or 71% where at least one baby survive. In cases where one fetus dies in utero, 20% of the survivors die, and in another 20% they have severe neurological morbidity. Laser treatment has now a survival rate of 54% for both twins and 81% for at least one survivor. Neurological morbidity seems to be less than 10%. Has this larger experience contributed to solve the question whether one or the other therapy is better? No, it only underscores that our estimate of the number of patients needed in a rct was right: 10% difference in survival rate and 15% for severe neonatal morbidity. All new data, all new studies are an urgent call for randomisation. If not, both patients and their obstetricians will continue to argue based on unsubstantiated views. Further case series will not bring any critically new element. Results Over 45 patients have now been included, all but a few in France. If we would extrapolate the number of patients randomised at our centre, only three other groups would have to recruit at the same pace to reach the 142 patients needed by the end of next year. Discussion There are many arguments to try to finish the study within a few years. It avoids the obvious bias due to improvements of perinatal resuscitation. It would keep high motivation amongst referring clinicians. I would dare to say more: at this point it has become unethical not to randomise cases with TTTS. Not laser, neither amniodrainage have become established yet as the best treatment and there is no room for empirical new techniques until the trial is completed.
