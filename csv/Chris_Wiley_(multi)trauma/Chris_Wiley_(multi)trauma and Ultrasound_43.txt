AB  - Background To clarify the diagnostic usefulness of imaging modalities in pelvic tumor practice, inpatients having pelvic neoplastic disorders in our Institute were reviewed. Methods For a total of 1506 cases undergoing ultrasonography (US) only, those receiving a combined usage of computed tomography (CT) and US, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and US, and all three modalities, we compared the indications and selected imaging modalities in relation to the stream of therapeutic procedure. Results 324 cases (21.5%) judged to have no structural disease through imaging techniques at previous Hospitals underwent no further imaging examination. 420 cases (27.9%), most of which underwent surgery and/or radiation due to malignant lesions in the ovary and/or uterus, had US alone, and 564 cases (37.5%) had CT in addition to US. The main indications for ordering additional CT were suspected distant metastasis, including pelvic and paraaortic lymphnodes. 95 patients (6.3%) had US and MRI under indication of tissue characterization in tumors. 103 cases (6.8%) with difficulties in diagnosis had all modalities; US, CT and MRI. In 324 cases without imaging modalities, 60 cases (18.5%) undergoing operative procedure were those with cervical neoplasm, and 70.0% of the cases followed by chemotherapy were for ovarian cancer. Such will be further discussed in detail.

AB  - Objective In about 80% of fetuses with trisomies, Turner syndrome, and in fetuses with skeletal abnormalities, genetic syndromes, structural abnormalities and cardiac defects, there is increased collection of fluid in the neck region. This can be visualized sonographically at 11?14?weeks of gestation as increased nuchal translucency thickness. The pathophysiology of this common phenotypic expression of different chromosomal abnormalities is uncertain, but there is some evidence that the underlying mechanism may be altered composition of extracellular matrix components and/or cardiac failure. Methods We performed a number of studies investigating nuchal skin tissue for various extracellular matrix components and cardiac heart failure using molecular techniques. We used northern blotting, immunohistochemistry, electron-microscopy and in situ hybridization. Results Studies investigating the heart found increased levels of mRNA for ANP and BNP, and reduced levels of Calcium ATPase, whereas transcript levels for GATA-4 were unchanged. Studies investigating components of the extracellular matrix in nuchal skin of trisomic fetuses found overexpression of ecm genes in trisomies (collagen type VI, collagen type IV, laminin) or an altered ratio of genes between normals and abnormals (collagen type VI). Conclusions The present data provide some evidence, that chromosomally abnormal fetuses with increased nuchal translucency at 12?14?week may suffer from an altered extracellular matrix of the heart and skin or transient heart failure.

AB  - Objective To verify the existence of a relationship between maternal cardiac function and peripheral hemodynamic parameters in normal and gestational hypertensive women. Methods 43 normotensive primigravidae were evaluated at 12?±?1, 21?±?1, and 33?±?1?weeks of gestation with uterine artery color Doppler and maternal echocardiographic examination comparing data of the third trimester with those of 21 gestational hypertensive women. Results The 43 healthy women showed a decrease in Uterine Resistance Index (RI) from I° to II° trimester (0.72?±?0.10 vs. 0.54?±?0.09, P?<?0.001) and modifications in Diastolic function parameters: E wave velocity and E/A ratio decreased; A wave velocity and deceleration time of the E wave increased; the left ventricular isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) decreased significantly (88.7?±?6.7, 75.6?±?7.7, 71.1?±?5.0 msec, P?<?0.001) showing a correlation with left atrial dimensions and RI (r?=??0.38, r?=?0.47, P?<?0.001). In the third trimester the comparison between normal and hypertensive women showed a significant reduction in (TVR) total vascular resistances (1006?±?212 vs. 1620?±?469, P?=?0.000) and IVRT (71?±?5.0 vs. 92.0?±?7.6 msec, P?=?0.000). Regression analysis showed a linear correlation between IVRT and TVR (r?=?0.68; P?<?0.01), Uterine RI and TVR were directly related (r?=?0.59, P?<?0.001). Conclusions Maternal diastolic function analysis may be useful to identify women who fully adapt to pregnancy and at risk for development of gestational hypertension.

AB  - Background Intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) of a selectively growth-retarded (IUGR) monochorionic (MC) twin is associated with high morbidity/mortality in the appropriately grown (AGA) twin. Selective laser photocoagulation (SLPCV) allows precise separation of the circulations of both twins. The aim of this study was to assess SLPCV in the treatment of MC-IUGR. Methods Patients with previable MC-IUGR were offered SLPCV. Absent or reverse end-diastolic velocity in the umbilical artery of the IUGR twin was also required for entry. Communicating vessels were identified endoscopically as deep artery-to-vein or superficial artery-to-artery or vein-to-vein as previously described. The communications were photocoagulated with Nd:YAG laser. Results SLPCV was performed in 11 patients (GA mean = 20.9?weeks). Survival of both fetuses was n?=?5 (45%), IUFD of the IUGR twin alone was n?=?4 (36%) and IUFD of the AGA twin alone was n?=?2 (18%). There were no dual losses, or adverse effects of an IUFD on the surviving twin. Previously undescribed superficial artery-to-vein anastomosis occurred in three patients. Conclusions SLPCV can effectively create a ?functionally dichorionic? placenta. SLPCV allows the AGA twin to avoid the adverse effects associated with IUFD of the IUGR twin. Unexpected IUFD of the AGA twin may reflect more complex placentation. A new type of vascular communication, superficial artery-to-vein, may have important pathophysiologic implications.

AB  - Summary Abdominal emergencies in the older patient frequently present atypically, and there is a high rate of misdiagnosis. Abdominal pain may be absent or minimal despite the present of serious intra-abdominal pathology. Abdominal pain may also be the presenting complaint in pulmonary or cardiac conditions. The commonest causes of abdominal symptoms in the older patient include biliary disease, bowel obstruction, diverticulitis, appendicitis, and peptic ulcer disease. Caution should be taken attributing abdominal pain to more benign conditions such as urinary tract infection or constipation, for fear of missing more serious pathology.

AB  - Objectives To assess the value of first trimester scanning for the diagnosis of structural and chromosomal abnormalities. Population/methods An unselected group of 7447 pregnant women who had a first trimester scan in our unit. In all the cases an anatomical survey was performed and the nuchal translucency was measured. Four thousand and 84 women also had second trimester biochemical screening. We assessed the performance of first trimester scanning in the detection of structural and chromosomal abnormalities. Results The incidence of anomalous fetuses was 1.4%, including 43 chromosomal abnormalities. The detection rate for structural abnormalities was 59% (37/63). Seventy-eight percent of chromosomal abnormalities were diagnosed at 11?14?weeks either because of a nuchal translucency measurement above the 99th centile or due to the presence of structural abnormalities. Second trimester biochemical screening detected half of the fetuses with trisomy 21 which were missed by first trimester screening, increasing the sensitivity to 90.5% (19/21; 95%C.I. 69.6% to 98.8%). However, the positive predictive value of the biochemical test was very low (0.5%). Conclusion First trimester NT measurement is an effective screening test for the prenatal detection of fetuses with structural and chromosomal abnormalities. Although the measurement of biochemical markers in the second trimester can detect additional affected fetuses this may be out-weighted by the delay in diagnosis, the extra visits and cost so that the right time for biochemical screening still needs to be determined. Second trimester anomaly scanning should continue to be an essential part of a prenatal screening programme.

AB  - Background To review the literature of utero-ovarian arterial blood flow and serum hormonal profile in the patients with polycystic ovaries (PCO) compared to the patients with normal menstrual cycles undergoing in-vitro fertilization treatment. Method Pertinent studies were identified through a computer MEDLINE search. References of selected articles were hand-searched for additional citations. Results The vascular impedance to uterine artery blood flow is higher during the luteal phase of PCO patients compared to the normally cycling patients and it does not show any dynamics throughout the menstrual cycle. In the normally cycling patients the active ovary shows dramatic hemodynamic changes during the cycle, therefore the vascular impedance to ovarian artery blood flow is almost constant throughout the menstrual cycle in the inactive ovary. In PCO patients the ovarian arterial blood flow in both ovaries is about the same as in inactive ovaries in the normally cycling patients. High vascular impedance to utero-ovarian arterial blood flow is associated with typical low vascular impedance of stromal ovary vascularization in PCO patients. In stimulated cycles a strong negative correlation between the vascular impedance to the uterine artery blood flow and the serum E2 concentration is found on the day of HCG administration. Taking only anovulatory PCO cycles into consideration, the above correlation is not confirmed. Conclusion Doppler analysis can be a valuable method for the assessment of utero-ovarian arterial blood flow in spontaneous and in stimulated cycles.

AB  - Background Twin-to-Twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a severe complication in monochorionic twin pregnancies. Particularly severe fetal and neonatal cardiac dysfunction is complicated in recipient twin and attended with high perinatal morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the abnormal echocardiographic features and clinical complications of cardiac disease in TTTS. Method We studied 20 pregnancies complicated with TTTS. Serial fetal and neonatal echocardiography were carried out and evaluated the following parameters: cardiothoracic area ratio, aortic and pulmonary artery Doppler peak velocities, umbilical arterial resistance index, preload index of inferior vena cava, ventricular valve regurgitation and structural heart abnormalities. Result In recipients, all features had cardiomegaly, tricuspid valve regurgitation and high preload condition with increased preload index of inferior vena cava. Aortic and pulmonary artery peak velocities were increased in the recipients than those in the donors. Three cases of recipients had pulmonary valve stenosis and received balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty. Furthermore, three cases of donors had coarctation of aorta and also received surgical repair. Conclusion In addition to the severity of cardiac dysfunction, pulmonary stenosis and coarctation of aorta would be the important factors to evaluate perinatal prognosis of TTTS.

AB  - Background Absent enddiastolic flow (AEDF) velocities are associated with fetal distress and adverse fetal outcome. The aim of this study was to evaluate perinatal findings of fetuses with an AEDF in fetal vessels and to investigate the neurological long-term-outcome. Method The analytical program ?Munich functional developmental diagnostics? (MFDD) was applied to the 90 children at different time intervals. The results of 40 children with an AEDF (Gr. I) and 20 children with pathological S/D-Ratio (Gr. II) were compared to the group of 30 children with normal Doppler-flow-findings (Gr. III) with the same pregnancy weeks at birth. Results The rate of C-section (92% vs. 71% vs. 36%), birthweight (1140g vs. 1725g vs. 2570g), 5?min. APGAR-Score (31% vs. 5% both) were significantly different in three groups. Brain sparing effect in the middle cerebral arteries was found in 81% in Gr. I, in 21% Gr. II and only 8% in Gr. III. At the time of neurological assessment the age of children was between 12 and 36?months. The developmental age for each functional category was evaluated and the difference between corrected age and developmental age was calculated. In 33% of all infants with a AEDF had a pathological neuromotoric development vs. 22% in Gr. II and only 15.3% in Gr. III. Conclusions The children with pathological Doppler-flow-measurements during pregnancy have not only very high risk of perinatal abnormality but also show a distinctly increased risk of impaired growth and neurodevelopmental disability comparing to the cases with a normal Doppler-flow-finding. Most of these fetuses showed brain-sparing effect. These aspects are very important to be discussed with the parents before the definitive perinatal decision is made.

AB  - Background The aim of this study was to evaluate arterial and venous intraovarian blood flow in infertile patients. Methods Seventy-six FSH stimulated cycles in 39 patients participating in a timed intercourse or iui program were studied. Transvaginal color and pulsed Doppler measurement of the dominant follicle and corpus luteum resistance index (RI), pulsatility index (PI), peak systolic velocity (PSV), maximum venous velocity (MVV) and serum p levels during mesoluteal phase were recorded. Velocimetric parameters were established and then used to classify ovarian function in normal ovulatory cycle (NOV; n?=?52), luteal phase defect (LPD; n?=?15) and luteinized unruptured follicle (LUF; n?=?9). Results The luteal PSV and MVV in the nov and LPD cycles were significantly higher (NOV: 24.3?±?12.2 vs. 13.1?±?6.5 and 8.1?±?3.30 vs. 3.6?±?1.1; LPD: 29.8?±?10.3 vs. 14.4?±?4.8 and 5.7?±?1.5 vs. 4.3?±?1.2) and luteal RI and PI were significantly lower (NOV: 0.45?±?0.06 vs. 0.55?±?0.08 and 0.62?±?0.15 vs. 0.83?±?0.22; LPD: 0.46?±?0.05 vs. 0.54?±?0.06 and 0.62?±?0.10 vs. 0.81?±?0.15) than follicular ones. LUF cycles did not show significant changes during the ovarian cycle (follicular vs. luteal PSV; MVV; RI and PI: 14.4?±?4.8 vs. 14.9?±?7.3; 4.3?±?1.2 vs. 4.2?±?2.1; 0.47?±?0.07 vs. 0.58?±?0.12 and 0.66?±?0.12 vs. 0.89?±?0.29) and no ?luteal conversion? of the Doppler signal was identified. There was significant correlation between luteal MVV and serum p (r?=?0.36). Conclusions Arterial and venous intraovarian blood flow remain unaltered during LUF cycles and P levels correlate with luteal MVV. This makes Doppler an effective noninvasive test to assess ovulation and luteal function.

AB  - Background The purpose of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of three-dimensional power Doppler imaging (3D-PDI) in the assessment of the patency of the fallopian tubes during hystero-salpingo-contrast sonography (HyCoSy). Methods HyCoSy using contrast medium echovist was done on 67 subfertile women. 3D-PDI and two-dimensional (2D) gray-scale imaging were used to visualize the contrast medium in the tubes. Results Contrast medium echovist produced prominent signals on the 3D-PDI image. Free spill of the fallopian tubes which had had the proximal part visualized was demonstrated in 114 (91%) tubes using 3D-PDI technique and in 58 (46%) tubes using conventional HyCoSy. The mean duration of imaging procedure was less than 3D-PDI. A significantly lower volume of contrast medium (5.9?+?0.6?ml) was used for 3D-PDI in comparison with volume (11.2?+?1.9?ml) used for conventional HyCoSy. Conclusions The 3D-PDI method appeared to have advantages over the conventional HyCoSy technique, especially in terms of visualization of spill from the distal end of the tube which was achieved twice as often with the 3D technique. The shorter duration of the imaging and lower volume of the contrast medium used suggested that the 3D-PDI technique may have a better side-effect profile. The 3D-PDI technique allowed better storage of the information for re-analysis and archiving than 2D scanning.

AB  - The acronym ared indicates two characteristic patterns of the Doppler Velocity Waveform (DVWF) namely the observation of absence (EDFA) or reverse (RF) blood flow in diastole. ARED flow are usually observed in fetuses presenting severe intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) or sometime are concomitant to fetal abnormalities like hydrops. The fetal condition is always severely affected mainly by hypoxaemia and/or acidaemia but at different levels according to the two patterns that are observed. Usually in the literature ared cases are presented and discussed without making difference between the two possible conditions. This approach cannot be considered correct because large differences in many clinical aspects are evident when evaluating separately EDFA or RF in 94 cases observed in our Institute. Gestational age, mean birth weight are significantly lower while perinatal mortality rate and prevalence of handicaps among survivors are significantly higher in the group presenting RF as compared to EDFA cases. As a consequence the clinical management is also different. In case of EDFA the timing of the delivery should be taken into consideration but it is not always urgent. On the contrary when RF is observed intrauterine death has to be expected within few days. Therefore the delivery should be immediate at the first observation of RF. The critical point is that also applying this policy the prevalence of handicaps among survivors is very high (35%). As a consequence when facing those clinical condition a careful and complete information must be offered to the family before choosing, if no maternal indications are present, an aggressive management.

AB  - The purpose of this project was to identify sources and clinical significance of 3DUS artifacts on patient diagnosis and to increase clinician and sonographer awareness to reduce misdiagnosis in 3DUS studies. To accomplish this 3DUS data were acquired and reviewed interactively. Artifacts were cataloged according to origin: B-mode, color/power Doppler or unique to 3DUS (acquisition, rendering or volume editing). Original scan planes, re-sliced planes and rendered images were evaluated. Overall our results showed a variety of artifacts. B-mode artifacts included drop-out, shadowing, etc. and depending on relationships between slice and imaging plane orientation. Color/power Doppler artifacts were related to gain, aliasing, and flash and could add apparent structure or confusion to the volume images. Rendering artifacts were due to parameter adjustment, shadowing and motion. Important structures could be removed by improper editing. In conclusion 3DUS and 2DUS are prone to similar artifacts plus others unique to 3DUS. Diagnostically significant artifacts can mimick abnormal development, masses, or missing structures thus requiring careful study before reaching a diagnosis.

AB  - Background The aim of this study was to compare the application of 2D neurosonography (USG) and 3D USG in newborns with respect to the time required to obtain the data for analysis. Method All newborns in whom neurosonography was indicated underwent 2D USG and 3D USG by the same investigator. The Voluson 530 D Color System was used with vaginal 5?8?MHz 3D probe for 3D imaging. 2D real-time imaging was performed with Aloka SSD 121 device using 5?MHz sector probe. The time needed to perform the examination was determined. Non-parametric Kruskal?Wallis rank sum test was used in statistical analysis. Results A total of 30 newborn infants of different gestational ages (ranging from 25 to 40?weeks) underwent USG after delivery at different postnatal ages (ranging from 2 to 60?days). The median time required to perform the 2D USG was 14?min (10?21). The median time required to perform the investigation by 3D USG was 5?min (ranging from 3 to 10). The difference was statistically significant (H?=?24.88; P?=?0.0031). The median time of data interpretation for 2D USG was 25?min (15?35), and for 3D USG it was 45?min (30?63). The difference was not statistically significant (H?=?13.22; P?=?0.1531). Conclusion The time necessary to obtain 3D USG compared to 2D USG images was shorter, which made it less stressful for the newborns. 3D USG provides more reliable information than 2D USG performed in the same patient at the same age. The time needed to interpret the data is longer for 3D USG but it can be performed after the imaging was terminated.

AB  - From animal studies it is known that fetus during hypoxia redistributes it's blood flow preferentially to the brain, heart and adrenal glands. In animal studies, a three-fold increase in adrenal blood flow has been demonstrated during hypoxia. The adrenals are relatively large organs in the fetus. Compared to fetal body weight, they are 20 times bigger than in the adult. The fetal adrenals respond to stress, such as hypoxemia by increased production of dihydroandrostendion (DHA), DHA sulfate and their metabolites. The adrenal gland is supplied by three arteries: the superior, coming from the inferior phrenic artery; the middle, from the abdominal aorta and inferior, arising from the renal artery. In the recent studies the Doppler signals were obtained from fetal middle adrenal artery. The normal adrenal PI shows decreasing values with the gestational age, which might suggest lower vascular resistance and high blood flow to the adrenals. From our observations the adrenal Doppler velocimetry is easier to record in fetuses from high-risk pregnancies than in normals, probably due to the adrenal sparing effect. Recent results suggest that the adrenal artery velocimetry might be useful in fetal assessment and predicting outcome. The ?adrenal-sparing? effect might be maintained at the same time the brain-sparing signs disappear.

AB  - Summary Chronic venous disease is a common disorder associated with a variety of symptoms in later disease stages but also with complications such as venous leg ulcer. This, in turn, has substantial socioeconomic effects and significantly impacts patients? quality of life. While there are a number of diagnostic procedures available, color-flow duplex ultrasound has become the gold standard. As regards therapeutic options, major advances have been made in recent decades. Today, there are alternatives to saphenofemoral ligation and stripping of the great saphenous vein, including endovenous thermal ablation techniques. However, treatment selection continues to depend on many factors such as individual anatomical circumstances and disease stage. The following article provides an overview of the anatomy and pathophysiology as well as current diagnostic and therapeutic standards.

AB  - Summary Regional anaesthesia is often helpful in improving respiratory function and analgesia following multiple rib fractures. The erector spinae plane block has become the technique of choice in our institution due to its relative simplicity and purported safety. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to determine its effectiveness in improving respiratory and analgesic outcomes. We reviewed electronic medical records of patients with traumatic rib fractures admitted to a level-one trauma centre between January 2016 and July 2017, who also received erector spinae plane blocks. We analysed the following outcomes before and up to 72 h after erector spinae plane blockade: incentive spirometry volume; maximum numerical rating scale static pain scores; and 12-h opioid consumption. Pre- and post-block data were compared. We included 79 patients, 77% of whom received continuous erector spinae plane block for a mean (SD) of 3.7 (1.9) days. The majority (85%) had other associated injuries. Incentive spirometry volumes improved from 784 (694) to 1375 (667) ml (p < 0.01) during the first 24 h following erector spinae plane blockade. Pain scores were reduced from 7.7 (2.5) to 4.7 (3.2) in the first three hours (p < 0.01). Reductions in opioid consumption were observed but did not achieve statistical significance. These improvements were largely sustained for up to 72 h. Mean arterial blood pressure remained unchanged from baseline. In conclusion, erector spinae plane blocks were associated with improved inspiratory capacity and analgesic outcomes following rib fracture, without haemodynamic instability. We propose that it should be considered to be a viable alternative to other regional analgesic techniques when these are not feasible.

AB  - Summary The use of new techniques has allowed the assessment of body composition to emerge as a fundamental part of nutritional assessment in clinical populations, as distinct body tissues are associated with specific health outcomes. This chapter focuses on the imaging methods: bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and, more recently, computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US) imaging which are appear to be the most convenient for use in clinical practice. Imaging methods for the assessment of body composition include DXA, CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and US, and three-dimensional (3D) (photonic) imaging. With the exception of US and 3D imaging, imaging techniques are now considered to be the most accurate tools for measuring adipose tissue and organs in clinical research. The use of these techniques has revolutionised the capacity to assess body composition and aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of a multitude of disease states and treatment regimes.
