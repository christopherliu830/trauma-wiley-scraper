AB  - Abstract Background Critical illness is associated with muscle loss, weakness and poor recovery. The impact that illness and the ensuing metabolic response has on obese patients is not known. Objectives were to test if obese patients lose less muscle depth compared to non-obese patients; if a reduction in muscle depth was associated with reduced strength and recovery; and to assess the feasibility of these methods with a range of body mass index's (BMI). Methods A prospective observational pilot study of muscle depth in critically ill patients categorised by BMI was performed. Muscle depth changes were assessed by ultrasound on study days 1, 3, 5, 7, 12 and 14. Strength was measured via handgrip dynamometry and Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score on waking and at discharge from the intensive care unit. Level of dependency was measured with the Barthel index. Results 44 critically ill patients; 17 had normal BMI, 10 were overweight and 17 were obese. The three groups did not differ in baseline characteristics, except obese patients had significantly greater initial muscle depth. Muscle depth loss was similar between the BMI groups at each of the time points. Handgrip and MRC sum score were only possible in a small number of patients because of reduced alertness and weakness. Majority were deemed fully dependent based on the Barthel index. Conclusions Obese patients lost muscle depth in a comparable manner to non-obese patients, suggesting that BMI may not prevent muscle depth loss. It was not possible to determine the effect on strength because the clinical condition of patients precluded reliable measurements.

AB  - Modern science is preoccupied with basic mechanisms at the level of the gene, molecule, atom and fundamental particle. This preoccupation has affected attitudes to medical science. Paradoxically, politicians and Departments of Health are largely cor cemed with clinical epiphenomena ? outcomes, interventions, effectiveness, efficiency ? that are often disregarded by medical scientists and viewed without favour by granting bodies. In the surgical sciences, there is renewed interest in clinical research. The small computer and the readily available database with its wmpatible statistical package have added a new dimension to clinical research. Database design and analysis are as much a part of the surgical investigator's skills as are laboratory techniques. There are simple rules that govern database design. The database should be simple and flexible, but provide an adequate patient profile. Entry should be standardized by precise inclusion criteria and precise definitions. Data input should be numerical whenever possible. The database program should convert simply to a comprehensive statistical program. The clinical database is useful for both observational and investigational studies. Case series, case control studies and cohort studies can all be developed from well maintained databases. In the Department of Surgery at Westmead Hospital, databases have been maintained for 10 years. The hepatobiliary and pancreatic group of databases have led to 34 publications. The liver tumour database has produced 12 studies and nearly 20 papers. The process of development of one study is outlined in detail. The chance observation of an excess incidence of gallstones in patients having regular ultrasound examinations after major abdominal surgery has been confirmed in a case control study. Of those patients undergoing major abdominal surgery 28% developed gallstones during 3 years of supervision. A prospective study is planned to investigate this further. The time is appropriate for clinicians to return to clinical research, for which they are uniquely trained. There should be no stigma associated with doing ?merely clinical research?.

AB  - Summary This case report describes a retrobulbar dermoid cyst in an 18-year-old pony with an invasive character into the frontal sinus. CT imaging was important for the appropriate management of this case and the definitive diagnosis was obtained from histopathology. Surgical excision was performed successfully without recurrence 1-year post-operatively. The pony returned to its intended use and previous performance level, although complaints of mild symptoms of headshaking were noted in bright light only.

AB  - Summary This study aims to evaluate the predictive value of left testicular volume (LTV) and right testicular volume (RTV) for testicular function respectively. Men who requested fertility testing for any reason were enrolled from December 2012 to November 2015. Subjects with primary scrotal diseases or a condition interfering reproductive system were excluded. Testicular volume (TV) was evaluated by scrotal ultrasound. Sex hormone and semen analysis including sperm concentration (SC) and sperm motility rate (SMR) were performed. Statistical analysis including comparison, stepwise linear regression and logistic regression was used. Two hundred and seventy-four patients with oligoasthenozoospermia/low testosterone and 27 control subjects were enrolled. Both LTV and RTV positively correlated with testicular function, and no differences were found between bilateral TV. RTV is the best independent factor associated with testicular function determined by SC (?=.292, p < .001), SMR (?=.227, p < .001) and total testosterone (TT) (?=.245, p < .001). Using a RTV value of 15.47 ml, the highest discriminating sensitivity and specificity were 66.7% and 62.4% respectively. RTV (<15 ml) was the only positive predictor for low testicular function (odds ratio=2.79, 95% confidence interval: 1.18?6.66; p =.020). RTV rather than LTV is the independent factor of overall testicular function determined by semen quality and TT levels. Further studies are needed to support and elucidate the difference in volume-function between bilateral testes.

AB  - Summary.? Venous thromboembolic (VTE) events are being increasingly diagnosed in systemic and cerebral vessels in children. Systemic VTE are increasing in children as a result of therapeutic advances and improved clinical acumen in primary illnesses that previously caused mortality. The epidemiology of systemic VTE has been studied in international registries. In children older than 3?months, teenagers are the largest group developing VTE. The most common etiologic factor is the presence of central venous lines. Clinical studies have determined the most sensitive diagnostic method for diagnosing upper system VTE are ultrasound for jugular venous thrombosis and venography for intrathoracic vessels. However, the most sensitive diagnostic methods for lower system VTE and pulmonary embolism (PE) have not been established. Treatment studies for VTE consist of inadequately powered randomized controlled trials or prospective cohort studies. The long-term outcome of systemic VTE, post-thrombotic syndrome, has been reported in children. Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) is becoming increasingly diagnosed in children due to the recognition of the associated subtle clinical symptoms and improved cerebrovascular imaging. The etiology of CSVT includes thrombophilia, head and neck infections, and systemic illness. Estimates of the incidence and outcome of childhood CSVT have recently become available through the Canadian Pediatric Ischaemic Stroke Registry. Clinical studies have not yet been carried out in children to determine the best method of diagnosis or treatment. There have only been case-series studies carried out in the treatment of CSVT. Properly designed clinical trials are urgently required in children with systemic VTE/PE and CSVT to define the best methods of diagnosis, treatment and long-term management.

AB  - Summary There is no doubt that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized our understanding of disease processes in the feet. Lameness associated with the navicular bone has been much better characterized since the advent of MRI, and the involvement of the surrounding soft tissues can now be evaluated in clinical cases. Injuries to the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) have only been accurately documented with the use of MRI, as ultrasonography does not allow visualization of the entire tendon. The DDFT obviously continues up into the pastern and proximal lesions may be evaluated with both MRI and ultrasound. Distal interphalangeal joint pain is still a common clinical diagnosis, often with no appreciable radiographic or MRI findings, and frequently representing synovitis or early osteoarthritis. Ossification of the cartilages of the feet and fractures of the ossified cartilages can be identified on MRI, as well as radiography and scintigraphy.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The objectives were to critically appraise the emergency medicine (EM) medical education literature published in 2016 and review the highest-quality quantitative and qualitative studies. Methods A search of the English language literature in 2016 querying MEDLINE, Scopus, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), and PsychInfo identified 510 papers related to medical education in EM. Two reviewers independently screened all of the publications using previously established exclusion criteria. The 25 top-scoring quantitative studies based on methodology and all six qualitative studies were scored by all reviewers using selected scoring criteria that have been adapted from previous installments. The top-scoring articles were highlighted and trends in medical education research were described. Results Seventy-five manuscripts met inclusion criteria and were scored. Eleven quantitative and one qualitative papers were the highest scoring and are summarized in this article. Conclusion This annual critical appraisal series highlights the best EM education research articles published in 2016.
