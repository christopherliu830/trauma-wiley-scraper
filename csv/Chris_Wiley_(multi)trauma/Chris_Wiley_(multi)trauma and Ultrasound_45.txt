AB  - Summary Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the equine stifle is currently one of the most challenging anatomical locations on the horse to image. Limitations in scanner design and the unique anatomy of the horse have made imaging of this region difficult in the best of circumstances. Imaging of the stifle with MRI should be considered when a horse's lameness has been localized to the stifle. Disruption of the medial meniscus is readily visible with MRI. Osteochondrosis dissecans (OCD) is the most common irregularity identified to date in equine MRI of the stifle. This is much more readily visible on MRI compared with traditional radiography. MRI allows the accurate imaging of previously unidentified bone marrow oedema. Routine imaging techniques such as radiography and ultrasound are unable to identify this pathological process. Cartilage erosions and damage not related to OCD fragmentation is readily visible using MRI evaluation.

AB  - ABSTRACT Although tuberculosis is mainly managed medically today, thoracic surgery continues to play a key role in its diagnosis and treatment in selected subgroups of patients. In certain scenarios such as multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, advanced tuberculous empyema and symptomatic bronchial stenosis, modern thoracic surgery may represent the only effective means of management in selected patients. Advances in thoracic surgery in recent years, in particular the use of Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery, not only reduce postoperative morbidity for individual patients, but may potentially allow a wider range of tuberculosis patients to benefit from surgery. Respiratory physicians and thoracic surgeons should continue to work together to ensure that tuberculosis patients who may benefit from surgery are identified for prompt and effective intervention.

AB  - Summary Fungal endometritis is a relatively rare cause of infertility in the mare, accounting for only 1?5% of all cases of endometritis. However, it remains a challenge to the clinician due to difficulties in diagnosing and effectively treating affected mares, resulting in a high rate of recurrence and a guarded prognosis for ongoing fertility. Often occurring as an opportunistic infection, the most common causes of fungal endometritis in the mare are yeasts (Candida spp.) and moulds with septated hyphae (Aspergillus spp.). Early detection and identification of the causative agent are vital when choosing appropriate treatment as sensitivities to commonly used antifungals vary significantly. Assessing inÂ vitro sensitivity for each isolate is accordingly recommended. Treatment of mares with fungal endometritis is multifaceted and includes; correction of any anatomical defects, uterine lavage and systemic and/or intrauterine infusion of antifungals. Concurrent bacterial infection is common so anticipation and subsequent treatment of bacterial endometritis is also often required.

AB  - A five-year-old male German shepherd dog presented with traumatic craniodorsal luxation of the right coxofemoral joint with pre-existing moderate hip dysplasia. A femoral head and neck ostectomy was performed. The patient was sedated with acepromazine and morphine administered intramuscularly. A?lumbosacral epidural was performed using a combination of morphine and ropivacaine. Intraoperatively, an infusion of medetomidine, morphine, lidocaine, and ketamine was administered intravenously, and oxygen was administered via facemask. Heart rate, respiratory rate and oscillometric arterial blood pressures were monitored. Postoperatively, carprofen was administered once subcutaneously. On the day of hospital discharge, carprofen and tramadol were administered orally every 12?hours. Twenty-one days later, the dog was doing well and the surgical staples were removed. Sedation with acepromazine and morphine, administration of an epidural containing morphine and ropivacaine, and intraoperative sedation with medetomidine, morphine, lidocaine and ketamine were suitable for femoral head and neck ostectomy.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aims:? There is a paucity of literature regarding the clinical profile of chronic pancreatitis (CP) in children. The aims of this retrospective study were to determine the etiology and clinical presentation, and to present our experience in diagnosing CP in children in China. Methods:? Clinical data of children who were treated for CP at Changhai Hospital from January 1997 to August 2006 were reviewed. Results:? A total of 427 CP patients presented to our center. There were 42 (9.8%) children with CP, including 21 males and 21 females, with a mean age of 11.7?years at the first onset. The main etiological factor was idiopathic (73.8%). Of the patients, 78.5% had episodes of mild to moderate abdominal pain and 54.8% had multiple (â¥?4) episodes. The mean duration of symptoms prior to the diagnosis was 41.6?months and a definite diagnosis was not made until 2?years later in 57.1% of these patients. The positive rates of ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) (or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) for detecting ductal changes and intraductal stones or pancreatic calcification were 51.4% and 45.4%, 71.4% and 87.5%, 80.0% and 61.5%, respectively. Conclusion:? The main etiological factor of Chinese children with CP is idiopathic. The main symptom in these patients is multiple episodes of mild to moderate abdominal pain, which often lead to a delay in the definite diagnosis. CT and MRCP (or MRI) should be used as the first investigation in the evaluation of these cases.

AB  - Abstract Necrotising fasciitis is a rare but potentially fatal disease. It is even more unusual as a primary disease of the breast. Surgical treatment is required in order to gain control over the spreading infection and mastectomy is reported to be the most common procedure. We report the first case of an otherwise healthy woman exhibiting a primary necrotising fasciitis of the breast, which was treated combining conservative surgery with hyperbaric oxygen (HO) and negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). A 39-year-old woman presented to the emergency room with fever and swelling of her right breast. The physical examination showed oedema and erythema of the breast, with bluish blisters on the lower quadrant. Ultrasound and CT scans showed diffuse oedema of the entire right breast, with subdermal gas bubbles extending to the fascial planes. Few hours later the necrotic area extended regardless an IV antibiotic therapy; a selective debridement of all breast necrotic tissue was performed and repeated 7 days later. The HO was started immediately after the first surgery and repeated daily (2Â·8 Bar, 120 min) for 18 days and then a NPWT (120?135 mmHg) was applied. Forty-five days after the last debridement, the breast wound was covered with a full-thickness skin graft. Several months later, an excellent cosmetic result was observed. This is the first case of primary necrotising fasciitis of the breast treated associating HO and NPWT to surgical debridement only; this combination resulted in a complete recovery with the additional benefit of breast conservation. Such result is discussed in light of the available literature on the treatment of primary necrotising fasciitis of the breast.

PY  - 1990
AB  - In the past year, total excision of mucinous biliary cystadenomas was carried out in three patients by shelling these lesions out from the liver substances. Formal hepatic resection was unnecessary. As any previous surgical procedure on the cyst will make subsequent excision technically more difficult, or even impossible, it is believed that excision should be carried out at the initial operation. Thus, a correct pre-operative or intraoperative diagnosis is important. This requires a high index of clinical suspicion, an adequate pre-operative work-up and an appropriate use of intra-operative ultrasound and frozen section to differentiate these lesions from other cystic lesions of the liver.

AB  - Abstract As emergency department (ED) visits continue to increase nationwide, the utilization of advanced practice providers (APPs) has been steadily increasing. Academic centers face unique challenges in the inclusion of APP staff into the educational and teaching environment. Effort should be made to both take advantage of and support the educational mission of academic centers while bolstering clinical care provided by APP staff. This paper highlights some of the considerations and challenges in incorporating APPs into academic EDs as discussed at the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine Annual Meeting in Indianapolis, Indiana, in May 2018. The panel included representation from Massachusetts General Hospital, Yale New Haven Hospital, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, and University of Massachusetts Medical School?Baystate. Distillation of our common experience shows that best practices in supervision favor uniformity between resident and APP staff except with low-acuity patients. Likewise, professional development takes advantage of the educational environment to provide feedback and identify areas for improvement as well as development of formal clinical and educational curricula for APPs working in academic institutions. Already established medical doctor residencies can be leveraged to provide postgraduate education for APPs in either formal or informal training programs.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes several clinical prediction rules for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) rule was created to help emergency clinicians to determine whether PE should be part of the differential diagnosis when the clinician is really not sure whether testing is even merited. Patients investigated for PE in a hospital ward are likely to have a higher Wells score for PE, and a smaller proportion will score 'PE unlikely'. Rule application relies on accurate recall of individual components, a detailed understanding of each component definition, the conversion of positive and negative findings into points, and tallying of the total score. The clinician then has to convert the final score into a dichotomous category. Finally, a prospective study from France demonstrated that deviation from standardised diagnostic PE protocols resulted in a 6% increase in mortality when compared to those who had appropriate protocol driven investigation.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study There are several epidemiological studies that have reported on risk factors for colic, this data has not been systematically reviewed. Objectives To systematically review the current evidence on risk factors for colic in the horse. Study design Systematic review in compliance with PRISMA guidelines. Methods The primary literature search was conducted in CAB Winner of Voorjaarsdagen Award 2014 (1910?2012), Web of Science (1950?2012) and MEDLINE (1946?2012) (between 23?26 November 2012), using the following terms: (horses OR horse OR equine OR equines OR equus OR equidae OR equids OR equid) AND colic. Publications were assessed independently against inclusion criteria (peer-reviewed articles relating to risk, causes, aetiology or predictors of colic) and exclusion criteria (nongastrointestinal or specific conditions, <3 cases) by LC and SF. Those selected were reviewed using a specifically developed quality assessment criteria (QAC) scoring system. Articles were ranked according to the QAC with those scoring greater than a specific critical threshold considered to be of the highest level of evidence. Results The search identified 1385 publications; 90 related to risk factors, 36 met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using the QAC. Nine publications were selected for final evaluation. Eight studies were based in the USA, and one multi-centre study in Europe. Individual papers identified risk factors pertaining to signalment, use of horse, clinical history, diet and other management details; however, there was inconclusive agreement for the majority of factors investigated. Consistent consensus between â¥3 studies identified increasing age, Arab and Thoroughbred breeds, recent change in diet or housing and a previous history of colic as significant risk factors for colic. Conclusions Evidence for many risk factors is weak and inconsistent, with a variety of confounders and interactions across the studies. There is strong evidence for age, breed, management changes and recent clinical history as risk factors. Ethical animal research:?The study was reviewed and approved by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham Ethics Committee. Sources of funding:?Laila Curtis was funded by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - A seven-year-old, neutered male greyhound was presented with a history of episodic shifting hindlimb lameness and pain. Ischaemic necrosis of areas of the hindlimb digits and skin and a firm swelling within the medial right thigh musculature were found on physical examination. Investigation demonstrated thrombosis of the terminal aorta and right external iliac artery with ischaemic necrosis of muscular and dermal tissue distal to the sites of thrombosis. The dog was euthanased due to poor prognosis. Necropsy findings were of a poorly differentiated invasive sarcoma of the skeletal muscle of the proximal right hindlimb, thrombosis of the aorta and right external iliac artery and secondary renal glomerulopathy. Immunohistochemistry of the neoplastic tissue indicated angiosarcoma based on expression of CD31 and factor VIII-related antigen. Thrombosis was considered likely to be due to systemic hypercoagulability because of the presence of altered flow characteristics and endothelial damage in the vascular tumour bed. Aortoiliac thrombosis, paraparesis and hindlimb ischaemia are unusual sequelae of angiosarcoma in the dog.

AB  - Background:Liver biopsies taken with an automatic Tru-Cut biopsy gun device caused unexpected fatal shock reactions in cats. The goal of the present study was to determine if this biopsy device caused more frequent fatal complications than did a semiautomatic device. Animals: All cats referred to the Utrecht University, between October 1, 2002, and October 31, 2004, in which ultrasound-guided Tru-Cut liver biopsies were taken. The indications for liver biopsy were increased liver enzyme activity, increased bile acid concentrations, ultrasonographic abnormalities of the liver, ultrasonographic abnormalities of the bile ducts, or some combination of these findings. Coagulation parameters were normal. Methods: From October 1, 2002, until October 31, 2003, 26 cats were biopsied with an automatic biopsy device. Between November 1, 2003, and October 31, 2004, 19 cats underwent liver biopsy with a semiautomatic biopsy device. Results: In the first period, 5 of the 26 cats (19%) developed severe shock within 15 minutes. Resuscitation was not successful. In the second period, none of the 19 cats experienced any major adverse effect. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to diagnosis, clinical signs, clinicopathologic findings, or the use of anesthetics. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: We conclude that the difference in complication rate is explained by the biopsy technique used. The pressure wave, which occurs when firing the automatic device, may have caused intense vagotonia and shock. Use of this automatic biopsy device should be avoided in cats because of the high risk of fatal complications.
