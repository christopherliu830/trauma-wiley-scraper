AB  - Summary In countries with a good standard of health care, intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) during the neonatal period affects 3·5?4·0% of all haemophilia boys, which is considerably (40?80 times) higher than expected in the normal population. ICHs are also frequent after the neonatal period, affecting 3?10% of the haemophilia population who are mainly treated on demand. The risk is higher in inhibitor patients. Spontaneous haemorrhage is reported more frequently than trauma-induced haemorrhage in most studies. The prevalence of ICH in patients treated with a prophylactic regimen is not known. Although more frequent in younger patients, a substantial proportion of ICH occur in adults, suggesting that general risk factors because of age, such as hypertension, are increasingly important as the haemophiliac gets older. Some studies have reported a substantial proportion of ICH affecting patients with milder forms of haemophilia. The risk of ICH has to be considered when discussing treatment strategies for haemophilia patients.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study There are several epidemiological studies that have reported on risk factors for colic, this data has not been systematically reviewed. Objectives To systematically review the current evidence on risk factors for colic in the horse. Study design Systematic review in compliance with PRISMA guidelines. Methods The primary literature search was conducted in CAB Winner of Voorjaarsdagen Award 2014 (1910?2012), Web of Science (1950?2012) and MEDLINE (1946?2012) (between 23?26 November 2012), using the following terms: (horses OR horse OR equine OR equines OR equus OR equidae OR equids OR equid) AND colic. Publications were assessed independently against inclusion criteria (peer-reviewed articles relating to risk, causes, aetiology or predictors of colic) and exclusion criteria (nongastrointestinal or specific conditions, <3 cases) by LC and SF. Those selected were reviewed using a specifically developed quality assessment criteria (QAC) scoring system. Articles were ranked according to the QAC with those scoring greater than a specific critical threshold considered to be of the highest level of evidence. Results The search identified 1385 publications; 90 related to risk factors, 36 met the inclusion criteria and were assessed using the QAC. Nine publications were selected for final evaluation. Eight studies were based in the USA, and one multi-centre study in Europe. Individual papers identified risk factors pertaining to signalment, use of horse, clinical history, diet and other management details; however, there was inconclusive agreement for the majority of factors investigated. Consistent consensus between ≥3 studies identified increasing age, Arab and Thoroughbred breeds, recent change in diet or housing and a previous history of colic as significant risk factors for colic. Conclusions Evidence for many risk factors is weak and inconsistent, with a variety of confounders and interactions across the studies. There is strong evidence for age, breed, management changes and recent clinical history as risk factors. Ethical animal research:?The study was reviewed and approved by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham Ethics Committee. Sources of funding:?Laila Curtis was funded by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the injuries of liver and spleen. In a nonoperative patient, angiographic embolization (AE) can be an adjunct in liver injuries that contains an arterio-venous fistula or have ongoing bleeding. Nonoperative management of blunt liver injuries in patients with normal hemodynamics is recommended with greater than 90% success. Hydatid disease of the liver is uncommon. It is caused by parasitic Echinococcus, which has dogs as its definitive hosts. Patients with high-grade liver injuries have an increased risk of developing post-injury biloma as a complication. The accessory spleen is a common anomaly, occurring in up to 20% of the population. However, it can occur in up to 30% of patients with a hematologic disorder. Splenic artery aneurysm is very uncommon, but it is the third most frequent abdominal artery to undergo aneurismal changes.

AB  - Abstract Fibromatosis of the breast is a rare condition that can be locally aggressive. The mainstay of treatment remains wide local excision, with varied adjuvant therapy as needed. The authors describe their experience in the treatment of a series of patients and propose the classification of primary and secondary breast fibromatosis. A single-institution retrospective analysis of patients treated for breast fibromatosis from 2003 to 2017 was completed. Demographic data, pertinent past medical history, and treatment modalities were reviewed. Primary breast fibromatosis was defined as arising in the absence of previous surgery or radiation therapy to the ipsilateral breast. Secondary breast fibromatosis was defined as arising in the setting of previous surgery or radiation therapy to the ipsilateral breast. A total of 16 patients were included with the median age 40 (28-64) years. The average size of the lesion was 6.37 cm (range of 1.5-15 cm). Mean follow-up time was 65 months. Surgical excision was completed in 14 patients, with two recurrences. There were no recurrences in patients with surgical margins >1 cm. Two patients were treated nonsurgically. There were seven patients with primary fibromatosis of the breast and nine patients with secondary fibromatosis of the breast. Fibromatosis of the breast is difficult to diagnose prior to surgical excision. We advocate for the multi-disciplinary treatment of this disease process with an aggressive surgical approach to achieve margins >1 cm.

AB  - Summary Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System (BI-RADS) was developed by the American College of Radiology to standardize breast imaging reporting. Whenever possible, mammography and ultrasound BI-RADS lexicon language is incorporated into the breast MR lexicon (e.g., shape and margin analysis). This chapter presents the key facts of breast MR interpretation and reporting breast MR. In breast MR lexicon lesion type imaging, three types of findings are reported: foci, mass, and non-mass-like enhancement. The chapter illustrates them in a table. It also discusses nipple retraction and invasion, extramammary findings, and kinetic assessment. Key facts and MRI features of common benign breast lesions and BI-RADS assessment categories are also presented.

AB  - Summary Disorders of fetal growth are commonly encountered in obstetrical practiceAlthough clinical estimation of fetal weight through symphysis-fundal height measurements may provide the first sign of aberrant fetal growth, ultrasound estimation of fetal weight remains the gold standard for diagnosing fetal growth disorders in developed countries. This chapter explores whether the use of customized fetal growth curves improve the detection rate of fetal growth restriction (FGR) as well as improve subsequent neonatal outcomes. It examines if antepartum surveillance with non-stress tests (NSTs) or biophysical profiles (BPPs) affect perinatal outcome in growth-restricted fetuses. The chapter discusses the predictive value of Doppler studies in identifying fetuses at risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes when performed on growth-restricted fetuses in the third trimester. It also provides information the on optimal timing of delivery in growth-restricted fetuses, supplementation with vitamins and antioxidants, and the association between FGR and neonatal health consequences.

AB  - Until the late-twentieth century, primary anatomical sciences education was relatively unenhanced by advanced technology and dependent on the mainstays of printed textbooks, chalkboard- and photographic projection-based classroom lectures, and cadaver dissection laboratories. But over the past three decades, diffusion of innovations in computer technology transformed the practices of anatomical education and research, along with other aspects of work and daily life. Increasing adoption of first-generation personal computers (PCs) in the 1980s paved the way for the first practical educational applications, and visionary anatomists foresaw the usefulness of computers for teaching. While early computers lacked high-resolution graphics capabilities and interactive user interfaces, applications with video discs demonstrated the practicality of programming digital multimedia linking descriptive text with anatomical imaging. Desktop publishing established that computers could be used for producing enhanced lecture notes, and commercial presentation software made it possible to give lectures using anatomical and medical imaging, as well as animations. Concurrently, computer processing supported the deployment of medical imaging modalities, including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound, that were subsequently integrated into anatomy instruction. Following its public birth in the mid-1990s, the World Wide Web became the ubiquitous multimedia networking technology underlying the conduct of contemporary education and research. Digital video, structural simulations, and mobile devices have been more recently applied to education. Progressive implementation of computer-based learning methods interacted with waves of ongoing curricular change, and such technologies have been deemed crucial for continuing medical education reforms, providing new challenges and opportunities for anatomical sciences educators.

AB  - Summary.? Background: Approximately one in four patients with acute proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) given anticoagulation and compression therapy develop post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Accelerated removal of thrombus by thrombolytic agents may increase patency and prevent PTS. Objectives: To assess short-term efficacy of additional catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) compared with standard treatment alone. Patients and methods: Open, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. Patients (18?75?years) with iliofemoral DVT and symptoms <?21?days were randomized to receive additional CDT or standard treatment alone. After 6?months, iliofemoral patency was investigated using duplex ultrasound and air-plethysmography assessed by an investigator blinded to previous treatment. Results: One hundred and three patients (64?men, mean age 52?years) were allocated additional CDT (n?=?50) or standard treatment alone (n?=?53). After CDT, grade III (complete) lysis was achieved in 24 and grade II (50%?90%) lysis in 20?patients. One patient suffered major bleeding and two had clinically relevant bleeding related to the CDT procedure. After 6?months, iliofemoral patency was found in 32 (64.0%) in the CDT group vs. 19 (35.8%) controls, corresponding to an absolute risk reduction (RR) of 28.2% (95% CI: 9.7%?46.7%; P?=?0.004). Venous obstruction was found in 10 (20.0%) in the CDT group vs. 26 (49.1%) controls; absolute RR 29.1% (95% CI: 20.0%?38.0%; P?=?0.004). Femoral venous insufficiency did not differ between the two groups. Conclusions: After 6?months, additional CDT increased iliofemoral patency from 36% to 64%. The ongoing long-term follow-up of this study will document whether patency is related to improved functional outcome.

AB  - Purpose? This study aimed to evaluate the pattern of solid intra-abdominal organ injuries in Central Australia, with focus on the mechanism of injury, Injury Severity Score (ISS), distribution of injury, role of surgical intervention and their outcome. It aimed to assess if difference exists in the above perimeters between the indigenous and non-indigenous population. Methodology? This is a retrospective analysis of a selected group of patients as identified by ICD Codes. Database has been created for patients admitted with renal, pancreatic, hepatic and splenic trauma over a five-year period (2001?2005). Data on demographics, mechanism of injury, distribution of injury, length of stay and ISS has been collected. Results? Seventy-one patients has been identified, with 51 (72%) indigenous and 20 (28%) non-indigenous. 29 patients (41%) were involved in a Motor Vehicle Accident and 33 (46%) were assaulted. There is no statistical difference with the distribution of injury and ISS amongst indigenous and non-indigenous populations. However there appears to have a higher incidence of surgical intervention associated with the indigenous group (28.8% versus 12.5%). This may be explained by the compliance rate as 29.4% of indigenous patients left against medical advice as compared with 0% with the non-indigenous group. Conclusion? The mechanism, pattern and severity of injury appear to be comparable amongst the indigenous and non-indigenous population in Central Australia. However there is a difference in their incidence of surgical intervention. ISS may not be as useful in prediction for need for intervention in this group and a different approach to trauma management may need to be tailored to this population.

AB  - Summary Supragingival and subgingival plaque appear to be the multifactorial initiating sources of oropharyngeal inflammation in cats. Inflammation may occur secondary to internal triggers and stimulation from antigens and pathogens located within or below the gingiva and oral mucosa. Gingivitis is the beginning stage of periodontal disease where the inflammation is confined to the gingival soft tissues and does not clinically extend into the tooth's support. Periodontal diseases are the most common oral maladies diagnosed in dogs and cats. Furcation involvement or exposure occurs secondary to periodontitis. Oronasal fistula are established communications between the oral and nasal cavities secondary to advanced periodontal disease extending from the palatal surfaces of the maxillary canine in dogs and from traumatic extraction of the maxillary canine teeth. Professional oral care includes mechanical procedures performed in the oral cavity.

AB  - Fully bioresorbable scaffolds (BRS) represent a novel approach for the percutaneous treatment of coronary artery stenosis, providing temporary vessel scaffolding with drug-eluting capability during the restenosis-prone phase of the vascular healing. Beyond this initial critical period, when mechanical scaffolding support is no longer necessary, the device is bioresorbed, restoring the normal vascular physiology with the aim to eliminate the long-term safety concerns related to permanent metallic implants. Nonetheless, current BRS technology suffers from limited mechanical properties as compared to available metallic platforms, requiring careful attention to lesion preparation, accurate vessel sizing, and implantation technique. Intravascular imaging has played an important role in providing knowledge on the acute effects after BRS deployment, and it helped refine the current technique of BRS implantation. In addition, extensive work with multiple intravascular imaging modalities have also contributed to the understanding of the unique dynamic vascular changes that are experienced in the treated segment from post-implantation up to complete device bioresorption. In this manuscript, we review the role of invasive imaging modalities?from angiography to sound- and light-based techniques?to guide BRS implantation procedures, to assess its acute results postimplantation, and the changes experienced in the long-term until complete bioresorption has ensued. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Introduction Serum immunoglobulin fractions were evaluated in horses participating in multi-day endurance exercise. Methods Serum IgGa, IgGb, IgG(T), IgA, and IgM were measured using horse-specific ELISA kits in 44 trained horses prior to racing, after each day of racing 50 miles per day and in 15 untrained matched control horses. Data were analyzed via repeated measures ANOVA (P<0.05). Results 44, 18 and 9 horses completed one, two and three days of racing, respectively. Serum IgA before racing (1.97?±?0.14?mg/dL) was similar to controls (1.48?±?0.19) and after one, two or three days of racing (1.98?±?0.13, 1.80?±?0.15 and 1.76?±?0.26). Serum IgM before racing (1.02?±?0.05?mg/dL) was similar to controls (1.08?±?0.12) and after one, two or three days of racing (1.03?±?0.06, 0.91?±?0.08 and 0.89?±?0.11). Serum IgG(T) before racing (6.10?±?0.41?mg/dL) was similar to controls (6.29?±?0.58) and after racing one, two or three days (6.23?±?0.45, 6.62?±?0.63, and 6.65?±?1.34). Serum IgGa was 2.41?±?0.10?mg/dL before racing, and was similar to controls (2.45?±?0.22) and each day of racing (2.58?±?0.14, 2.39?±?0.20, and 2.61?±?0.22, on days one, two and three of racing). Resting serum IgGb concentration was significantly lower in control (5.71?±?0.54?mg/dL) than trained horses (7.65?±?0.41). Conclusions Serum IgGb is higher in trained endurance horses, perhaps reflecting immune stimulation related to disease exposure or more frequent vaccination. Ethical Animal Research All procedures were approved by the Oregon State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Owner informed consent was obtained for all horses in the study.
