AB  - Fully bioresorbable scaffolds (BRS) represent a novel approach for the percutaneous treatment of coronary artery stenosis, providing temporary vessel scaffolding with drug-eluting capability during the restenosis-prone phase of the vascular healing. Beyond this initial critical period, when mechanical scaffolding support is no longer necessary, the device is bioresorbed, restoring the normal vascular physiology with the aim to eliminate the long-term safety concerns related to permanent metallic implants. Nonetheless, current BRS technology suffers from limited mechanical properties as compared to available metallic platforms, requiring careful attention to lesion preparation, accurate vessel sizing, and implantation technique. Intravascular imaging has played an important role in providing knowledge on the acute effects after BRS deployment, and it helped refine the current technique of BRS implantation. In addition, extensive work with multiple intravascular imaging modalities have also contributed to the understanding of the unique dynamic vascular changes that are experienced in the treated segment from post-implantation up to complete device bioresorption. In this manuscript, we review the role of invasive imaging modalities?from angiography to sound- and light-based techniques?to guide BRS implantation procedures, to assess its acute results postimplantation, and the changes experienced in the long-term until complete bioresorption has ensued. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Introduction Serum immunoglobulin fractions were evaluated in horses participating in multi-day endurance exercise. Methods Serum IgGa, IgGb, IgG(T), IgA, and IgM were measured using horse-specific ELISA kits in 44 trained horses prior to racing, after each day of racing 50 miles per day and in 15 untrained matched control horses. Data were analyzed via repeated measures ANOVA (P<0.05). Results 44, 18 and 9 horses completed one, two and three days of racing, respectively. Serum IgA before racing (1.97?±?0.14?mg/dL) was similar to controls (1.48?±?0.19) and after one, two or three days of racing (1.98?±?0.13, 1.80?±?0.15 and 1.76?±?0.26). Serum IgM before racing (1.02?±?0.05?mg/dL) was similar to controls (1.08?±?0.12) and after one, two or three days of racing (1.03?±?0.06, 0.91?±?0.08 and 0.89?±?0.11). Serum IgG(T) before racing (6.10?±?0.41?mg/dL) was similar to controls (6.29?±?0.58) and after racing one, two or three days (6.23?±?0.45, 6.62?±?0.63, and 6.65?±?1.34). Serum IgGa was 2.41?±?0.10?mg/dL before racing, and was similar to controls (2.45?±?0.22) and each day of racing (2.58?±?0.14, 2.39?±?0.20, and 2.61?±?0.22, on days one, two and three of racing). Resting serum IgGb concentration was significantly lower in control (5.71?±?0.54?mg/dL) than trained horses (7.65?±?0.41). Conclusions Serum IgGb is higher in trained endurance horses, perhaps reflecting immune stimulation related to disease exposure or more frequent vaccination. Ethical Animal Research All procedures were approved by the Oregon State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Owner informed consent was obtained for all horses in the study. Sources of funding:?Department of Biomedical Sciences at Oregon State University. Competing interests:?none.

AB  - Purpose? Prospective validation of recently established independent predictors for postinjury abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) was performed. Methodology? All trauma patients who met inclusion criteria (ICU admission, ISS?>?15, Base Deficit (BD)?>?5, or resuscitation with >5?L crystalloids) were prospectively monitored. Patients with isolated head injuries were excluded. Demographics, ISS, resuscitation fluids, physiological parameters, intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and the independent predictors in two time windows ?ED discharge?[SBP, crystalloids, Time-to OR, transfusions] and ?ICU admission?[crystalloids, urine output (UO), Hb, Temperature, BD] were collected. Data are presented as mean ?±? SEM, p?<?0.05 considered significant. Results? Twenty-two blunt trauma patients were monitored (Age 39?±?5 years, 77% males, ISS 32?±?2, SBP 107?±?5 mmHg, BD 7?±?1). No patients developed ACS. Seven patients developed IAH (IAP?>?20?mmHg). IAH and non-IAH patients had the same age (41?±?7 vs 37?±?5?yrs) and admission BD (7.5?±?1.3 vs 6.3?±?1.2). IAH patients had higher ISS than non-IAH patients (39?±?3 vs 30?±?2). Outcomes (IAH vs non-IAH): ICU LOS (39?±?3 vs 30?±?2), Mortality (0% vs 7%), MOF (29% vs 0%). ?ED-discharge predictors?: The IAH and non-IAH patients had similar admission SBP, ED crystalloid volume, transfusions and ED time. ?ICU-admission predictors?: IAH and non-IAH patients had similar UO, crystalloid infusions, BD, temperature but the IAH group had lower Hb (99?±?5 vs 111?±?3?g/dl) than the non-IAH patients. Conclusions? The incidence of ACS decreased from 14% to 0% in a comparable population. The predictors for ACS did not predict IAH. After the elimination of the lethal ACS, the clinical importance of postinjury IAH has to be defined.

AB  - Summary This study aimed to discuss the role medical imaging has on diagnosis of musculoskeletal desmoid tumours and to describe their radiological appearances on various imaging modalities. Imaging of histologically proven cases of desmoid tumours at St. Vincent's Hospital Melbourne were obtained via picture archiving communication system (PACS) and then assessed by two musculoskeletal radiologists. Suitable imagings were obtained from PACS. All imaging chosen was de-identified. Desmoid tumours can occur in many areas of the body. Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis of these tumours and magnetic resonance imaging has been the gold standard for imaging and is the most accurate in terms of assessing tumour margins and involvement of surrounding structures.

AB  - Chronic painful Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a common disorder among athletes. Sclerotherapy (ST) and prolotherapy (PT) are two promising options among the numerous other conservative therapies. As their efficacy and potential adverse effects (AE) are still unclear, we systematically searched, analyzed, and synthesized the available literature on ST and PT for treating AT. Electronic databases, Google Scholar and articles? reference lists were searched according to PRISMA guidelines. Eligibility criteria were set up according to the PICOS-scheme including human and animal studies. Three authors independently reviewed the results and evaluated methodological quality (Coleman Methodology Score and Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment). The initial search yielded 1104 entries. After screening, 18 articles were available for qualitative synthesis, six of which were subjected to meta-analysis. The mean Coleman Score of the 13 human studies was 50. Four RCTs were ranked as having a low risk of selection bias. Three of those reported a statistically significant drop in the visual analog scale (VAS) score, one a significant increase in the VISA-A Score. 12 of 13 human studies reported positive results in achieving pain relief and patient satisfaction, whereas only one study's finding differed. Meta-analysis revealed an unambiguous result in favor of the intervention (weighted mean difference D=?4.67 cm, 95% CI ?5.56 to ?3.76 cm [P<.001]). Only one serious AE and two minor AEs were reported in the entire literature. This systematic review suggests that ST and PT may be effective treatment options for AT and that they can be considered safe. Long-term studies and RCTs are still needed to support their recommendation.

AB  - ABSTRACT A bubble oxygenator (the TM or the OCVC oxygenator) has been produced with development efforts focused particularly on reduction of the nonphysiological characteristics of this type of oxygenator. The structural features of the apparatus are: (1) a reduction to the minimum of adequate priming volume, (2) an oxygen disperser designed to ensure evenly dispersed, uniform-sized bubbles, (3) a volume-control system for the oxygenating chamber (the OCVC system) based on extensive experimental oxygenation studies, and (4) an integrated double microfilter of the gravity-drainage type. Clinical features are: (1) ease of operation in perfusion, (2) reduction in hemolysis and postoperative blood loss, and (3) fewer complications associated with microemboli. Clinical use on over 200 infants and children proved generally very satisfactory. The background of its development is briefly described as are future modification plans.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the pediatric surgery. Emergent surgical airways in children carry a higher risk of complications compared with adults. These include injury to the airway, tube misplacement or dislodgment, and longer-term risks of subglottic stenosis. A cuffed tube in the trachea is the only ?definitive? airway, although temporary airway devices such as the laryngeal mask airway or combined esophageal/tracheal tubes can provide initial airway control and oxygenation/ventilation until a definitive airway can be established. Younger children have a higher incidence of higher level cervical spine injuries. Burn-related injuries are much less common, but are a cause of significant morbidity and often lifelong disability. Risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the pediatric population are parenteral nutrition supplementation, central venous catheter, deep sedation, and neuromuscular blockade.

AB  - Objective? The purpose of our investigation was to evaluate factor(s) associated with unexplained antepartum bleeding of unknown origin (ABUO) after 24 weeks of pregnancy and correlate unexplained haemorrhage with maternal and perinatal outcomes. Design? This is a retrospective observational study. Setting? King Edward Memorial Hospital (KEMH), Subiaco, Western Australia. Population? Singleton pregnancies delivering at KEMH between January 1998 and December 2004. Methods? ABUO was defined as bleeding after 20 weeks of gestation but before the onset of labour with no cause detected on vaginal examination or abdominal ultrasound. Outcomes of these pregnancies were collated and compared with those of pregnancies without ABUO. Main outcome measures? Antepartum complications assessed included pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, gestational diabetes and preterm birth. Intrapartum evaluations included labour inductions, mode of delivery and gestational age at delivery. Neonatal outcomes evaluated included birthweight, Apgar scores, newborn intensive care unit (NICU) admission, neonatal complications and risk of perinatal/neonatal death. Results? Between January 1998 and December 2004, there were 26?583 deliveries without ABUO and 1431 with ABUO. Multivariable analyses of the ABUO effects revealed that ABUO was a simultaneously significant risk factor for term labour inductions (OR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.72?2.32, P < 0.001), preterm delivery (OR = 4.31, 95% CI: 3.84?4.84, P < 0.001), NICU admission (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.01?1.51, P = 0.042), hyperbilirubinaemia (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.01?1.63, P = 0.041) and reduced birthweight (26 g, 95% CI: 3?50, P = 0.026). Conclusion? Women with ABUO are at greater risk of preterm delivery, term labour induction and their neonates are at greater risk for NICU admissions, hyperbilirubinaemia and a reduced birthweight.

AB  - Summary Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (UEDVT) can cause complications, including pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome. The majority of primary UEDVTs are caused by abnormalities of the costo-clavicular junction. Central venous catheter (CVC)/peripherally-inserted central catheters (PICCs) are the most significant cause of secondary UEDVT, and are present in about half of all cases. Goals of therapy of UEDVT include reduction or elimination of symptoms, prevention of DVT progression, or embolisation and reduction of the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Anticoagulation, using the same approach as used for lower extremity DVT (LEDVT), is the mainstay of therapy for UEDVT. Anticoagulants do not result in fibrinolysis. Therefore, vein recanalisation depends on endogenous fibrinolytic processes. Various interventional therapies have been evaluated as a means of attempting to accelerate the process of recanalisation, with the goal of reducing the risk of PTS and, perhaps, the risk of DVT recurrence.

AB  - Summary We undertook a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to compare the analgesic efficacy of pre-operative stellate ganglion block on postoperative pain relief after upper limb orthopaedic surgery. Patients were administered a 3-ml injection during ultrasound-guided stellate ganglion block; 15 patients received lidocaine 2% and 15 patients received 0.9% saline. Following the block, all patients received standardised general anaesthesia. Postoperative analgesia included regular intravenous diclofenac, paracetamol and patient-controlled analgesia with tramadol for 24 h. Patients were observed at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h after surgery for tramadol consumption, cardiovascular variables and visual analogue scale pain scores at rest and on movement. The mean (SD) hourly tramadol consumption was significantly reduced in the lidocaine group compared with the saline group at 4 h (8.0 (10.1) mg vs 28.0 (12.6) mg, respectively; p = 0.001), 6 h (5.3 (10.8) mg vs 17.3 (12.7) mg, respectively; p = 0.013) and 8 h (5.3 (11.8) mg vs 21.3 (9.1) mg, respectively; p = 0.001). The cumulative 24-h tramadol consumption was 97.3 (16.6) mg in the lidocaine group and 150.6 (26.0) mg in the saline group (p = 0.001). There were significant differences in the pain visual analogue scale at rest at two time points; at 4 h the median (IQR [range]) visual analogue scale scores were 4 (4?6 [2?8]) in the lidocaine group and 5 (4?6 [2?7]) in the saline group (p = 0.03), and at 6 h visual analogue scale scores were 3 (3?4 [3?6]) and 4 (4?6 [2?7]), respectively (p = 0.04). Pain visual analogue scale on movement was lower in the lidocaine group at all time intervals compared with the saline group, but this did not reach statistical significance. The present study has demonstrated a postoperative tramadol-sparing and analgesic effect of pre-operative stellate ganglion block in patients undergoing upper limb orthopaedic surgery under general anaesthesia.

AB  - The editors of Academic Emergency Medicine are pleased and privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, May 16?19, 2007, in Chicago. The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To compare the incidence of clinically evident post-operative complications, financial cost and length of hospital stay for Dachshunds with acute intervertebral disc disease treated with decompressive surgery with and without the use of methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS). Design: Retrospective clinical study Setting: Veterinary Teaching Hospital Animals: Dachshunds that presented to the Veterinary Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania between January 1994 and December 1999 with acute intervertebral disc disease that were treated with decompressive surgery. Intervention: None Measurements and Main Results: Dogs were divided into 2 groups dependent upon whether they had received MPSS. Medical records were examined for evidence of post-operative complications. Other parameters recorded included details of drugs administered (principally corticosteroids and gastrointestinal protectant drugs), length and cost of hospital stay and neurological status at 24 hours post-operatively and at suture removal. Compared to other corticosteroids, dogs receiving MPSS had a significantly higher incidence of clinically evident post-operative gastrointestinal complications, an increased use of gastrointestinal protectant drugs, and an increased cost for hospital stay (p<0.01). Conclusions: The use of MPSS inDachshunds with acute intervertebral disc disease is associated with an increased post-operative complication rate and an increased financial cost to the client. The use of MPSS should be carefully evaluated for each patient.

AB  - Introduction Problems in the musculoskeletal system are the most common reason for impaired function and culling in insured riding horses in Sweden. Impaired function of the fetlock, e.g. arthritis, is a believed to be a multi-factorial problem. The aim of the pilot study was to find factors associated with problems in the fetlock. Methods This study focused on horses 5?7 years with fetlock problems. A questionnaire on training and management (feeding, housing, shoeing) was sent to 200 horse-owners with insurance policies on their horses; 100 had claimed insurance compensation for problems in the fetlock (I-horses) and 100 owners had healthy horses that served as controls (C-horses). The results of the proportions in each group were compared with a Chi-squared test. The response rate was 42%. Results The results showed significant differences for training-related factors but not for management-related factors. The healthy C-horses were ridden for a longer period of time at each occasion (58.5 minutes per day) compared to I-horses (51.3 minutes per day) (P?=?0.043). The C-horses jumped once a week and the I-horses 0.5 times per week (P?=?0.0075). There was a tendency for shorter period of training free weeks to be beneficial (C-horses 4.0 weeks, I-horses 5.5 weeks per year; P?=?0.083). A larger proportion of the I-horses participated in the Swedish Riding Horse Quality Test for four-year old horses (P?=?0.043). Conclusions The results indicated that training-related factors were associated with whether a horse remained healthy or not. Further studies on training and educational systems of young horses are needed to prevent impaired function. Ethical Animal Research No animals were used in the study. Sources of funding:?This study was financed by the insurance company ?Agria? which approved submission of the results for presentation and publication in conjunction with ICEEP 9. Competing interests:?none.
