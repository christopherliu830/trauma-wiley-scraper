AB  - Abstract Objective To report outcomes and risk factors for mortality in dogs that underwent surgical management of lung lobe torsion. Study design Retrospective case series from 5 veterinary teaching hospitals (2005?2017). Animals Fifty dogs with 52 instances of lung lobe torsion. Methods Data collected from medical records included signalment, clinical findings, results of clinicopathologic testing and diagnostic imaging, surgical treatment, lung lobe affected, intraoperative and postoperative complications, histopathologic and microbiologic findings, and outcome. Follow-up was obtained from medical records and telephone contact with primary care veterinarians. Results Fifty-two instances of lung lobe torsion were identified in 50 dogs, with a median follow-up of 453?days (range, 0?3075). Forty-six (92%) dogs survived to discharge. Dogs with concurrent torsion of the right cranial and middle lung lobes were less likely to survive (2/4) than those with torsion of the left cranial lung lobe (22/22). No other risk factors for mortality prior to hospital discharge were identified. Overall median survival time after hospital discharge was 1369?days. Four dogs had >1 episode of lung lobe torsion. Conclusion The percentage of dogs surviving to discharge after surgical treatment of lung lobe torsion was higher than previously reported. The short- and long-term prognosis was excellent with surgical treatment of lung lobe torsion. Clinical significance Surgery should be recommended when lung lobe torsion is suspected because of the high survival to discharge rate and excellent long-term prognosis.

AB  - ABSTRACT In recent years, a higher and higher percentage of patients with pleural effusions or pneumothorax are being treated with small-bore (10?14?F) chest tubes rather than large-bore (>20?F). However, there are very few randomized controlled studies comparing the efficacy and complication rates with the small- and large-bore catheters. Moreover, the randomized trials that are available have flaws in their design. The advantages of the small-bore catheters are that they are easier to insert and there is less pain with their insertion while they are in place. The placement of the small-bore catheters is probably more optimal when placement is done with ultrasound guidance. Small-bore chest tubes are recommended when pleurodesis is performed. The success of the small-bore indwelling tunnelled catheters that are left in place for weeks documents that the small-bore tubes do not commonly become obstructed with fibrin. Patients with complicated parapneumonic effusions are probably best managed with small-bore catheters even when the pleural fluid is purulent. Patients with haemothorax are best managed with large-bore catheters because of blood clots and the high volume of pleural fluid. Most patients with pneumothorax can be managed with aspiration or small-bore chest tubes. If these fail, a large-bore chest tube may be necessary. Patients on mechanical ventilation with barotrauma induced pneumothoraces are best managed with large-bore chest tubes.

AB  - Abstract Delayed bone healing and non-union occur in approximately 10% of long bone fractures. Despite intense investigations and progress in understanding the processes governing bone healing, the specific pathophysiological characteristics of the local microenvironment leading to non-union remain obscure. The clinical findings and radiographic features remain the two important landmarks of diagnosing non-unions and even when the diagnosis is established there is debate on the ideal timing and mode of intervention. In an attempt to understand better the pathophysiological processes involved in the development of fracture non-union, a number of studies have endeavoured to investigate the biological profile of tissue obtained from the non-union site and analyse any differences or similarities of tissue obtained from different types of non-unions. In the herein study, we present the existing evidence of the biological and molecular profile of fracture non-union tissue.

AB  - Summary Recent major technological advances in Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have enabled the accurate, noninvasive detection and characterization of hepatic lesions. Due to its relative lower cost, availability and widespread distribution, CT is often the primary imaging modality in the initial evaluation of the liver. However, with comparatively superior lesion-to-liver contrast, ability to utilize hepatocyte-specific contrast agents, and lack of ionizing radiation, MRI is realizing an increasingly greater role in this regard. For assessment of the gallbladder and biliary system, ultrasound (US) remains a basic modality for the prompt diagnosis of stones and acute inflammatory or obstructing processes. Advanced CT & MR techniques are utilized for evaluating equivocal US findings, oncologic staging, preoperative planning and post-operative complications. This chapter reviews the discriminating imaging features of commonly encountered hepatobiliary pathology at cross-sectional imaging.

AB  - An 11-month-old Border collie presented collapsed and continued to deteriorate rapidly despite supportive treatment. The dog had a history of failure to thrive and recurring respiratory infection. Laboratory abnormalities included neutrophilic leucocytosis, Heinz body anaemia, hyperammonaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia, proteinuria and hypocobalaminaemia. Post-mortem examination revealed multi-focal necrosis within the heart, kidneys, pancreas, liver, meninges and cerebral cortex. Fungal hyphae in lesions were identified as Scedosporium prolificans following culture. Subsequent genotyping confirmed that the dog carried the CUBN:c.8392delC mutation in a homozygous state, verifying hereditary cobalamin deficiency (a.k.a. Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome). Cobalamin deficiency may have been a predisposing factor for the development of systemic fungal infection in this dog.

AB  - Abstract Background: Augmented reality (AR) allows the surgeon to represent holographic patient-specific anatomical information and surgical instruments in the physical world. To correctly superimpose virtual and physical objects, a hand-eye (HE) calibration method for mapping the virtual and physical spaces was proposed. Methods: Mathematical relationships between the virtual camera and the physical space were derived. Finally, the accuracy and robustness of the proposed HE calibration method were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated. Results: The proposed calibration method allows us to determine an optimal invariant spatiotemporal mapping between the virtual camera and the physical space. Conclusion: Qualitatively and quantitatively reliable and accurate estimates for the physical-virtual mapping transformation were verified. Consequently, imaging data and surgical instruments holograms can be precisely represented in the physical space.

AB  - Abstract Objective: Correlate the necropsy diagnosis with the history, diagnostic findings, and clinical course of dyspneic cats with primary lung parenchymal disease. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Matthew J. Ryan Veterinary Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Animals: Client-owned cats over 6 months of age hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a primary problem of respiratory distress that had pulmonary parenchymal disease on thoracic radiographs, and a complete necropsy. Interventions: None. Measurements and main results: Cats included were assigned into 2 groups based on the pulmonary histopathology: inflammatory (n=8) and neoplastic (n=7) disease. No statistical difference was found between the groups with regard to age, body weight, clinical signs, duration of clinical signs, physical examination findings, thoracic radiography, duration of hospitalization, treatment, and outcome. Cats with neoplasia had a statistically higher mean total white blood cell count (26.60?k/?L±10.41) than those with inflammatory lung disease (11.59?k/?L±4.49; P=0.026). Cats with bacterial or viral pulmonary disease had a significantly shorter median duration of illness (5 days, range 1?7 days) than all other cats (30 days, range 7?365 days; P=0.0042). Ultrasound guided pulmonary fine-needle aspiration (FNA) provided an accurate diagnosis in 5/5 cases. Conclusions: Forty-seven percent of cats with pulmonary parenchymal disease had neoplasia. The clinical diagnosis was difficult to obtain ante-mortem; lung FNA appeared to be the most helpful diagnostic tool in these cases.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction: Median and ulnar nerves are used in comparative electrophysiological studies. We analyzed the conduction values in these hand nerves in healthy volunteers to find any physiological differences between them. Methods: We performed standard conduction studies and conduction velocity distribution (CVD) tests with estimation of 3 quartiles in 31 healthy right-handed volunteers (17 women, 14 men) with a mean age of 44.8?±?15.5?years. Results: The conduction velocities in all quartiles of CVD tests were statistically faster in the ulnar nerve (P?<?0.00001), with no differences in the spread of conduction values and no differences between sides. In the ulnar nerve, CVD velocities in all quartiles were faster in the female group (P?<?0.05). Discussion: The ulnar nerve has more fibers conducting with high velocities than does the median nerve. Electrophysiological comparisons between hand nerves must be performed carefully. Muscle Nerve 59:470?474, 2019

AB  - Abstract A series of 14 cases of renal parenchymal carcinoma in patients under 20 years of age is presented and reviewed with the best documented case reports from the literature. Unlike its adult counterpart the tumour has an equal sex ratio and minor trauma frequently precipitates presentation, otherwise its behaviour is similar. The treatment of choice is nephrectomy but, unlike adults, there is evidence to support the value of adjunctive radiotherapy and chemotherapy in the treatment of local spread. Prognosis is particularly worsened by cellular granularity, and vascular or direct extrarenal spread. The 5 year survival rate is 52 per cent.

AB  - Introduction Alkalinizing agents have been given to horses before exercise to provide exogenous buffering effects. The objective of this experiment was to determine the intra- and inter-day variability of resting plasma tCO2. The hypothesis was that tCO2 would vary measurably during a multi-day quarantine. Methods Eight acclimated sedentary horses had jugular venous samples collected into 10-ml heparinized evacuated glass tubes 3 times daily (7 AM, 11 AM, and 3 PM) for 5 consecutive days. Horses ate 5.3?kg alfalfa hay at both 7 AM and 3 PM after blood sampling. Plasma tCO2 was determined within 1?3 hours of sampling using an automated chemistry analyzer. Mean tCO2 for all 8 horses was calculated for each of the 15 sampling intervals. Results were compared by Repeated Measures ANOVA. When there was no apparent day-to-day effect, data for all horses were pooled by time-of-day (n?=?40 samples for each of 3 times-of-day) and compared by the Student's t test to determine time-of-day effect. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results Mean tCO2 over the 15 sampling intervals ranged from 28.9-to-31.6?mmol/L and was lower at 11 AM (Day 1) and 3 PM (Days 1, 3, and 4) compared to 7 AM on Day 1 (P<0.05). Individual plasma tCO2 ranged over 4-to-7 units (low 26, high 34, widest range 26?32, narrowest 28?31). Mean pooled tCO2 differed by time-of-day, with 11 AM (30.1?±?0.2, P?=?0.011) and 3 PM (29.8?±?0.2, P<0.001) values lower than 7 AM values (31.0?±?0.2). Conclusions Plasma tCO2 differed significantly by time-of-day with considerable intra- and inter-individual variability. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the University of Illinois Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Sources of funding:?Fédération Equestre Internationale and Maria Caleel Fund for Equine Sports Medicine Research. Support for Dr. Bergstrom was provided by the Merial Veterinary Scholars Program. Competing interests:?none.
