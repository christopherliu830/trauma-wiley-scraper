AB  - Abstract A series of 14 cases of renal parenchymal carcinoma in patients under 20 years of age is presented and reviewed with the best documented case reports from the literature. Unlike its adult counterpart the tumour has an equal sex ratio and minor trauma frequently precipitates presentation, otherwise its behaviour is similar. The treatment of choice is nephrectomy but, unlike adults, there is evidence to support the value of adjunctive radiotherapy and chemotherapy in the treatment of local spread. Prognosis is particularly worsened by cellular granularity, and vascular or direct extrarenal spread. The 5 year survival rate is 52 per cent.

AB  - Introduction Alkalinizing agents have been given to horses before exercise to provide exogenous buffering effects. The objective of this experiment was to determine the intra- and inter-day variability of resting plasma tCO2. The hypothesis was that tCO2 would vary measurably during a multi-day quarantine. Methods Eight acclimated sedentary horses had jugular venous samples collected into 10-ml heparinized evacuated glass tubes 3 times daily (7 AM, 11 AM, and 3 PM) for 5 consecutive days. Horses ate 5.3?kg alfalfa hay at both 7 AM and 3 PM after blood sampling. Plasma tCO2 was determined within 1?3 hours of sampling using an automated chemistry analyzer. Mean tCO2 for all 8 horses was calculated for each of the 15 sampling intervals. Results were compared by Repeated Measures ANOVA. When there was no apparent day-to-day effect, data for all horses were pooled by time-of-day (n?=?40 samples for each of 3 times-of-day) and compared by the Student's t test to determine time-of-day effect. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results Mean tCO2 over the 15 sampling intervals ranged from 28.9-to-31.6?mmol/L and was lower at 11 AM (Day 1) and 3 PM (Days 1, 3, and 4) compared to 7 AM on Day 1 (P<0.05). Individual plasma tCO2 ranged over 4-to-7 units (low 26, high 34, widest range 26?32, narrowest 28?31). Mean pooled tCO2 differed by time-of-day, with 11 AM (30.1?±?0.2, P?=?0.011) and 3 PM (29.8?±?0.2, P<0.001) values lower than 7 AM values (31.0?±?0.2). Conclusions Plasma tCO2 differed significantly by time-of-day with considerable intra- and inter-individual variability.

AB  - Introduction The objective of this study was to provide more information regarding the relationship between heart rate (HR) and performance in show-jumpers. Methods Ten mixed breed horses (9.1?±?1.9?yrs) were assessed at a British Equestrian Federation (BEF) World Class Performance three-day training session. Riders received coaching during warm-up (WU) and after jumping a 15 fence (1.35?1.45?m) course once on day-1, twice on days 2  on day-3 the second round was an 8-fence jump-off. Clinical assessments were performed, and plasma lactate concentrations determined, pre- and post-exercise. Take-off distance (TDF) was determined using high-speed motion capture. The coach graded horse jumping technique (validated methodology). HR was recorded telemetrically from WU until 10?mins post-exercise. Variables were compared using regression procedures/Spearman correlation and paired Students t-test (P<0.05). Results HR was not significantly different between days or consecutive jumping rounds. Mean HR was lower in WU than during the course (127?±?11 vs 136?±?16: P?=?0.027), likely related to increased speed during the course, although HRpeak tended to be higher during WU day- 1 possibly reflecting excitement. Mean HR increased for each quarter during the course. Higher mean course and third-quarter HR were associated with higher blood lactate concentrations (P?=?0.047), greater gluteal and longissimus dorsi muscle spasm on palpation (P<0.01), more faults (P?=?0.044) and lower technique scores (P?=?0.019). TDF was negatively correlated with mean course and third-quarter HR, indicating that closer take-off may be harder work (P<0.01). Conclusions HR increases throughout a jumping course. Higher HRs may be associated with jumping inefficiency and muscle spasm, with potential performance implications for multi-day competitions. Ethical Animal Research Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study is not stated.

AB  - Abstract Introduction The influence of levator-ani muscles on second-stage labor is poorly understood. The ability of these muscles to stretch without damage may affect birth outcomes, but little is known about material properties, effects of pregnancy and/or ethnicity on levator-ani stiffness. There are strong associations between muscle damage and subsequent pelvic floor disorders. This study aimed to quantify levator-ani muscle stiffness during the third trimester of pregnancy and postpartum in European and Polynesian women. Associations between stiffness, obstetric variables, and the risk of intrapartum levator-ani injury (avulsion) were investigated. Material and methods This was a prospective observational pilot study. A total of 167 (106 European and 61 Polynesian) nulliparous women were recruited antenatally; 129 returned postnatally. Participants were assessed between 36 and 38 weeks' gestation and three to five months postpartum. Assessments included pelvic floor ultrasound, elastometry testing, and validated questionnaires on pelvic floor function. Logistic regression, Student t-, Chi-square and Mann?Whitney tests were used as appropriate. Results There are significant differences between antenatal and postnatal muscle stiffness measurements (p < 0.01). Stiffness was significantly higher in the European cohort (p = 0.03). There were more avulsion injuries in European (20%) than in Polynesian (9%) women. There were no significant differences in antenatal stiffness between women with and without avulsion, but change in stiffness (antenatal to postnatal) was significantly less in the avulsion group. There were no associations between stiffness, and other obstetric variables, epidural anesthesia seemed protective (p = 0.03). Conclusions Quantification of levator-ani muscle stiffness is feasible. Muscle stiffness is significantly different before and after birth.

AB  - Summary The ultimate goal of periodontal therapy is to restore periodontal tissues lost through disease or trauma. The most predictable way to accomplish this goal is by guided tissue regeneration (GTR). The principle of GTR is to give preference to certain cells to repopulate the wound area to form a new attachment apparatus. Clinically this is accomplished by placing a barrier over the defect thereby excluding gingival tissues from the wound during early healing. The first generation of GTR barriers were non-resorbable which implies that they have to be removed in a second surgical procedure. Resorbable barriers have recently been introduced, changing GTR into a single-step procedure. Periodontal defects that will predictably benefit from GTR therapy are intrabony, furcation class II and gingival recession defects. This paper reviews the scientific evidence of what can be achieved by GTR procedures for various periodontal defects as well as factors of importance to increase the predictability of a successful treatment outcome. Résumé L'objectif ultime de la thérapie parodontale est de restaurer les tissus parodontaux perdus par la maladie ou des lésions. Le moyen le plus logique de réaliser cet objectif est par régénération tissulaire guidée (RTG). Le principe en est de donner la préférence à certaines cellules pour repeupler la région lésée, afin de former un nouvel appareil de soutien de la dent. Sur le plan clinique, ceci est fait en plaçcant une barrière sur le défaut, ce qui permet d'exclure les tissus gingivaux de la lésion pendant les premières phases de cicatrisation. La première génération de barrières de RTG était non-résorbables, ce qui signifiait qu'il fallait en faire l'ablation lors d'une seconde opération chirurgicale. Des barrières résorbables ont été introduites récemment, transformant la RTG en une procédure à phase unique. Les défauts parodontaux dont on peut dire qu'ils bénéficieront probablement de la thérapie par régénération tissulaire guidée sont les défauts intra-osseux, les bifurcations de classe II et les récessions gingivales. Cet article examine d'abord les preuves scientifiques de ce qui peut être fait par des procédures de régénération tissulaire guidée pour diverses pertes de tissus parodontaux et étudie ensuite les facteurs essentiels permettant d'accrôitre la possibilité de prévision d'un traitement réussi. Zusammenfassung Die Parodontaltherapie soll dazu dienen, infolge Parodontitis oder Trauma zerstörtes parodontales Gewebe wiederherzustellen. Die hinsichtlich dieses Ziels zuverlässigste Methode ist die gesteuerte Geweberegeneration (GTR). Mit der GTR-Therapie, bei der eine bestimmte, hierfür am besten geeignete Zellart in dem Wundareal angesiedelt wird, soll parodontales Attachment regeneriert werden. Die klinische Durchführung erfolgt durch Plazierung einer Barriere über den Defekt, was eine Deckung der Wunde mit Gingivalgewebe während der frühen Heilungsphase verhindert. Die ersten GTR-Membranen waren nichtresorbierbar, was bedeutete, daß sie nur temporär implantiert wurden und eine zweite parondontalchirurgische Maßnahme zu ihrer Entfernung erforderlich war. Die neueren, biologisch abbaubaren Barrieren erfordern nur noch einen einzigen Eingriff. In folgenden Fällen ist das GTR-Verfahren indiziert: Furkationsbeteiligung II. Grades, intraossäre Defekte und Gingivarezession. Im Zentrum des vorliegenden Artikels steht die Überprüfung der wissenschaftlichen Ergebnisse im Zusammenhang mit der Anwendung des GTR-Prinzips in Fällen unterschiedlicher Parodontaldefekte. Ebenfalls diskutiert werden die für den Behandlungserfolg bzw. die Langzeitstabilität ausschlaggebenden Faktoren. Resumen El objetivo primordial de la terapia periodontal es el de restaurar los tejidos periodontales que se han perdido por enfermedad o trauma. El método más seguro para alcanzar este objetivo es la regeneración tisular guiada (RTG). El principio de la RTG es el de dar preferencia a ciertas células para repoblar la zona de la herida y formar un nuevo aparato de unión. Clínicamente esto se logra colocándose una barrera sobre el defecto, excluyendo así a los tejidos gingivales de la herida durante la cicatrización inicial. La primera generación de barreras eran no reabsorbibles, lo que significa que deben ser removidas por medio de un segundo procedimiento quirürgico. Se han introducido recientemente barreras reabsorbibles y ahora la RTG se lleva a cabo en un solo procedimiento. Este trabajo examina la evidencia científica de lo que puede lograrse mediante la RTG en el caso de distintos defectos periodontales, como también los factores de importancia para asegurar el éxito del tratamiento.

AB  - Most indications for performing echocardiography focus on the evaluation of properties intrinsic to the heart. However, numerous extra-cardiac conditions indirectly convey changes to the echocardiographic appearance through alterations in the governing physiology. Pulmonary embolism increases pulmonary arterial pressure if a sufficient cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed is occluded. This may result in dilatation of the right ventricle and, in severe cases, concomitant early diastolic septal collapse into the left ventricle. Acute respiratory failure has been shown to yield a similar echocardiographic appearance in experimental conditions due to the resultant pulmonary vasoconstriction. Echocardiography in the presence of pulmonary disease can reveal underlying cardiac pathologies such as pulmonary hypertension that contribute to the clinical severity of respiratory distress. Positive pressure ventilation affects preload, afterload, and compliance of both ventricles. The echocardiographic net result cannot be uniformly anticipated, but provides information on the deciding physiology or pathophysiology. Mediastinal pathology including tumors, herniation of abdominal content, and pleural effusion can often be visualized directly with echocardiography. Mediastinal pathologies adjacent to the heart may compress the myocardium directly, thus facilitating echocardiographic and clinical signs of tamponade in the absence of pericardial effusion. In conclusion, many pathologies of extra-cardiac origin influence the echocardiographic appearance of the heart. These changes do not reflect properties of the myocardium but may well be mistaken for it. Hence, these conditions are essential knowledge to all physicians performing echocardiography across the spectrum from advanced cardiological diagnostics to rapid point-of-care focused cardiac ultrasonography.

AB  - Abstract Over 70% of patients initiating chronic hemodialysis in the United States have a tunneled central venous catheter (CVC) for dialysis as their first blood access device. Tunneled CVC have requirements that are unparalleled by other access devices: high blood flow rates at moderate pressure drops without obstruction, minimal trauma to the vein, resistance to occlusion by fibrous sheathing, prevention of infection, avoidance of clotting, biocompatibility, avoidance of lumen collapse and kinking and breaks, resistance to antiseptic agents, placement with minimal trauma, and radiopaque appearance on X-ray. This publication reviews the numerous designs for tunneled CVC and evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of each design. A catheter that self-centers in the superior vena cava (Centros?) is described, along with early clinical results. Current challenges and future directions for tunneled CVC for dialysis are discussed, included means to diminish catheter-related infections, catheter tip clotting, fibrous sheathing, central venous stenosis, and external component bulk.

AB  - Summary Objective? To compare the prevalence of genitourinary abnormalities in men diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI) in a Cameroonian hospital and those without. Patients and methods? Consecutive adult men aged 18?75?years, whose midstream urine samples were received for microscopy, culture and sensitivity at the microbiology laboratory of the Yaounde University Teaching Hospital, Cameroon, constituted the study population. Genitourinary abnormalities were diagnosed from history, physical examination, abdominal and transrectal ultrasonography, plain abdominal X-ray, and if indicated urethrocystoscopy and biopsy. Results? Of the 206 patients who qualified, 179 completed the study and 63 (35.2%) were found to have UTI. A total of 41 (65.1%) patients with UTI (mean age 69.2?years) had at least one genitourinary abnormality, compared to 13 (11.2%) of those without UTI (mean age 61.9?years) (P?<?0.001). The age-adjusted prevalence of genitourinary abnormalities was 59.4% in the UTI group and 12.1% in the non-UTI group (P?<?0.001). The most frequent genitourinary abnormality in men with UTI was benign prostatic enlargement, followed by urethral stricture. The crude odds ratio (95% confidence intervals) for UTI associated with genitourinary abnormality was 14.77 (6.80?32.05), and the adjusted odds ratio 11.51 (7.08?29.46). Conclusion? Urological evaluation of Cameroonian men with UTI, using simple history taking, physical examination, ultrasound examination and plain abdominal X-ray, could have significant clinical benefits in this tropical African region.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of developing a core content for subspecialty training in clinical ultrasonography (US) is to standardize the education and qualifications required to provide oversight of US training, clinical use, and administration to improve patient care. This core content would be mastered by a fellow as a separate and unique postgraduate training, beyond that obtained during an emergency medicine (EM) residency or during medical school. The core content defines the training parameters, resources, and knowledge of clinical US necessary to direct clinical US divisions within medical specialties. Additionally, it is intended to inform fellowship directors and candidates for certification of the full range of content that might appear in future examinations. This article describes the development of the core content and presents the core content in its entirety.

AB  - Objectives To describe, in a cohort of dogs with presumed primary immune-mediated neutropenia, the presenting clinical characteristics, haematology results, bone marrow characteristics, therapies used (drugs and doses), clinical response to treatment, relapse and outcome at six months and one year. Methods Multi-institutional recruited retrospective descriptive case series with voluntary submissions. Presumed immune-mediated neutropenia was diagnosed based on a neutrophil concentration <1·5?109 cells/L on a minimum of two complete blood counts, exclusion of other causes of neutropenia based on a diagnostic bone marrow aspirate or biopsy, and exclusion of secondary immune-mediated neutropenia. Dogs meeting these diagnostic criteria between 2006 and 2013, and that had a haematocrit of ≥29% and minimum of two complete blood clounts performed after initiation of therapy, were included. Results Information on 35 dogs was included. Neutropenia was less than 0·5?109 cells/L in most cases (21 dogs), 0·5 to ·99?109 cells/L in 11, and 1.0 to 1·49?109 cells/L in three. Eight dogs had thrombocytopenia, which was severe (<49·9?109 cells/L) in three. [Correction added on 23 May 2017, after first online publication: the cell numbers were incorrect due to errors in the conversion of cell measurements to international units. The numbers have been corrected throughout the article and Table 2.] Twenty-three dogs had myeloid hyperplasia, 10 dogs had myeloid hypoplasia and two dogs had normal myelopoiesis. Neutropenia resolved in 32 of 33 dogs within two weeks of starting corticosteroid therapy and in all dogs within one month. Relapse of neutropenia occurred in 12 cases within one year. Clinical Significance Initial response of presumed primary immune-mediated neutropenia cases to corticosteroid therapy can be excellent. Long-term monitoring for relapse is warranted because 34% of cases relapsed during or after taper of immunosuppressive medications.

AB  - Abstract The effect of recombinant erythropoietin (rhEPO) on renal and systemic hemodynamics was evaluated in a randomized double-blinded, cross-over study. Sixteen healthy subjects were tested with placebo, or low-dose rhEPO for 2 weeks, or high-dose rhEPO for 3 days. Subjects refrained from excessive salt intake, according to instructions from a dietitian. Renal clearance studies were done for measurements of renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the segmentel tubular handling of sodium and water (lithium clearance). rhEPO increased arterial blood pressure, total peripheral resistance, and renal vascular resistance, and decreased renal plasma flow in the high-dose rhEPO intervention and tended to decrease GFR. In spite of the decrease in renal perfusion, rhEPO tended to decrease reabsorption of sodium and water in the proximal tubule and induced a prompt decrease in circulating levels of renin and aldosterone, independent of changes in red blood cell mass, blood volumes, and blood pressure. We also found changes in biomarkers showing evidence that rhEPO induced a prothrombotic state. Our results suggest that rhEPO causes a direct downregulation in proximal tubular reabsorption that seems to decouple the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system from changes in renal hemodynamics. This may serve as a negative feed-back mechanism on endogenous synthesis of EPO when circulating levels of EPO are high. These results demonstrates for the first time in humans a direct effect of rhEPO on renal hemodynamics and a decoupling of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

AB  - In this special issue of Academic Emergency Medicine, the Editorial Board is privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM), May 22?25, 2000, San Francisco, CA. The depth, breadth, and future of our specialty and our practice are reflected in these brief research summaries; the creativity, talent, and dedication of our researcher colleagues are documented on these pages. We are honored to be able to share them with you. This year, 990 abstracts were received and considered for presentation at the Annual Meeting. Fifty percent were submitted electronically. Each abstract was evaluated by six to nine independent reviewers who were blinded to the author, the study institution, and the other reviewers. Final determinations for acceptance were made by members of the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by Judd Hollander, and the Program Committee chair, Sue Stern. These decisions were based on the mean score received after review and the space available for presentations within the program. The type of presentation (oral platform vs poster), the assigned topic section, and the position of presentation in the program were also determined. As was the case last year, we have reproduced these abstracts from electronic versions supplied by the submitting authors. In general, we have not edited, proofread, changed, or corrected the abstracts; they appear as submitted by the authors, who are responsible for their content. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. The institution listed is that of the presenting author. A list of common abbreviations used in the abstracts begins on page 596. An index to key words, authors, and topics begins on page 598.
