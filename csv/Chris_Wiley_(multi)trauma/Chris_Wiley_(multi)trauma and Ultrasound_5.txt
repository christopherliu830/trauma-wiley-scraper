AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare palpation-guided with ultrasound-guided brachial plexus blockade in Hispaniolan Amazon parrots. Study design? Prospective randomized experimental trial. Animals? Eighteen adult Hispaniolan Amazon parrots (Amazona ventralis) weighing 252?295?g. Methods? After induction of anesthesia with isoflurane, parrots received an injection of lidocaine (2?mg?kg?1) in a total volume of 0.3?mL at the axillary region. The birds were randomly assigned to equal groups using either palpation or ultrasound as a guide for the brachial plexus block. Nerve evoked muscle potentials (NEMP) were used to monitor effectiveness of brachial plexus block. The palpation-guided group received the local anesthetic at the space between the pectoral muscle, triceps, and supracoracoideus aticimus muscle, at the insertion of the tendons of the caudal coracobrachial muscle, and the caudal scapulohumeral muscle. For the ultrasound-guided group, the brachial plexus and the adjacent vessels were located with B-mode ultrasonography using a 7?15?MHz linear probe. After location, an 8-5?MHz convex transducer was used to guide injections. General anesthesia was discontinued 20?minutes after lidocaine injection and the birds recovered in a padded cage. Results? Both techniques decreased the amplitude of NEMP. Statistically significant differences in NEMP amplitudes, were observed within the ultrasound-guided group at 5, 10, 15, and 20?minutes after injection and within the palpation-guided group at 10, 15, and 20?minutes after injection. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. No effect on motor function, muscle relaxation or wing droop was observed after brachial plexus block. Conclusions and clinical relevance? The onset of the brachial plexus block tended to be faster when ultrasonography was used. Brachial plexus injection can be performed in Hispaniolan Amazon parrots and nerve evoked muscle potentials were useful to monitor the effects on nerve conduction in this avian species. Neither technique produced an effective block at the doses of lidocaine used and further study is necessary to develop a useful block for surgical analgesia.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? In the era of orally active agents, dynamic penile color-duplex ultrasound (D-PCDU) is not considered a necessary first screening for all patients with erectile dysfunction (ED). Various parameters, such as peak systolic flow velocity, end diastolic velocity, resistance index, acceleration time, and degree of arterial dilatation, have been suggested for the diagnosis of vascular ED by D-PCDU. Aim.? To highlight the clinical utility and evidence-based interpretation of D-PCDU criteria. Methods.? Extensive, unsystematic PubMed literature search reviewing relevant data on D-PCDU in the evaluation of male ED. Results.? The advantage of ultrasound is the minimally invasive nature of the procedure and the ability to screen patients to identify a normal arterial response of cavernous arteries. Men with sexual dysfunctions above 55 years of age and comorbidities are more likely to have multi-organ vascular dysfunction and may necessitate further testing because erectile failure may be the first presenting symptom requiring investigation and treatment even in the absence of cardiovascular risk factors. All patients affected with Peyronie's disease and younger men with persistent ED, a history of pelvic traumas, or fractures of the penile shaft should be offered ultrasonographic penile blood flow studies before referral to surgery or more invasive vascular investigations. Conclusions.? In the near future, D-PCDU may be used in preference to patients presenting with or without vascular risk factors, particularly those not responding to first-line orally active drugs and seeking an explanation as to why these agents failed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Trauma is the most common cause of death and significant morbidity in childhood; abusive head trauma (AHT) is a prominent cause of significant morbidity and mortality in children younger than 2 years old. Correctly diagnosing AHT is challenging both clinically and radiologically. The primary diagnostic challenges are that the abused children are usually too young to provide an adequate history, perpetrators are unlikely to provide truthful account of trauma, and clinicians may be biased in their assessment of potentially abused children. The main radiological challenge is that there is no single imaging finding that is independently specific for or diagnostic of AHT. The radiological evaluation should be based on the multiplicity and severity of findings and an inconsistency with the provided mechanism of trauma. While the most common neuroimaging finding in AHT is subdural hemorrhage, other less well-known magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings such as the ?lollipop sign? or ?tadpole sign,? parenchymal or cortical lacerations, subpial hemorrhage, cranio-cervical junction injuries including retroclival hematomas, as well as diffuse hypoxic brain injury have been identified and described in the recent literature. While AHT is ultimately a clinical diagnosis combining history, exam, and neuroimaging, familiarity with the typical as well as the less-well known MRI findings will improve recognition of AHT by radiologists.

AB  - Contents This study investigated the epididymis of mature boars (n?=?10) by means of B-mode ultrasound and grey-scale analysis (GSA) for echogenicity (EG) determination using an ultrasound unit HS 1500V, a linear transducer (frequencies 7.5?9.0?MHz), and standardized unit settings. All boars had their epididymal caput, corpus and cauda scanned six times before and after semen collection, respectively, at weekly intervals. Semen was subjected to spermatological examination including volume, total and forward motility, sperm abnormalities, as well as total sperm count and concentration. The caput and corpus both had a homogeneous fine echotexture. The cauda was homogeneous too but had a marbled echotex-ture. Echogenicity before and after semen collection was caput?>?corpus?>?cauda, respectively (p?<?0.001). Echogenicity was higher before than after semen collection for all parts of the epididymis, respectively (p?<?0.001). Echogenicity of the caput correlated slightly positively with the total sperm count pre-collection (r?=?0.301; p?=?0.020) and with ejaculate volume pre- and post-collection (r?=?0.302 vs 0.306; p?=?0.017 vs 0.019), and slightly negatively with sperm concentration post-collection (r?=??0.275; p?=?0.034). No relationship was found for EG of the corpus and cauda for any of the ejaculate parameters. In conclusion, B-mode ultrasound and GSA proved feasible for imaging the epididymis in boars. Single relationships between EG and ejaculate parameters were found and deserve further investigation.

AB  - Abstract The purposes of our study were to correlate ultrasonographically measured and joint angle estimated excursions of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendons of the hand and to estimate the relative motion of FDS and FDP while gripping cylinders of standard diameter in normal human subjects. Thirty wrists from 15 human subjects were imaged with an ultrasound scanner. Speckle tracking was used to measure the excursion of the FDS and FDP tendons. The tendon excursions necessary to grip three differently sized acrylic tubes were measured and correlated with the corresponding finger joint angles. The FDP/FDS excursion ratio was calculated. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between the FDS excursion and MP?+?PIP joint angle was 0.61. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between the FDP?+?FDS excursion and the DIP?+?PIP?+?MP joint angle was 0.67. The FDP/FDS excursion ratio was smaller for larger excursions (gripping a smaller diameter tube) and larger for small excursions (gripping a larger diameter tube, P?<?0.01). These data suggest that speckle tracking may be a useful method to discriminate the relative motion of flexor tendons, which in turn may be relevant in evaluating tendon function, for example after tendon injury. ? 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the ability to obtain diagnostic cytology samples from appendicular bone lesions using ultrasound-guided needle aspirations. Secondary objectives were to compare cytological evaluations with histopathological results and to determine the utility of staining malignant mesenchymal cells for the presence of alkaline phosphatase. Methods: Aspirations from 36 aggressive appendicular bone lesions with histological diagnoses were included in the study. Ultrasound was used to guide the needle to the medullary cavity or the adjacent soft tissue mass. The smears stained with Wright-Giemsa and nitroblue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate toluidine salt (NBT/BCIP) were examined. Results: A diagnostic sample was obtained in 32 of the 36 cases. Of the 32 diagnostic samples, cytology indicated sarcoma, with a sensitivity of 97 per cent (confidence interval: 83 to 100 per cent) and a specificity of 100 per cent (confidence interval: 16 to 100 per cent). When a diagnosis of sarcoma was made on cytology, alkaline phosphatase staining indicated osteosarcoma, with a sensitivity of 100 per cent (confidence interval: 87 to 100 per cent). Clinical Significance: The results of this study indicate that ultrasound-guided needle aspiration of aggressive bone lesions is a viable technique for identifying malignant mesenchymal cells and for diagnosing sarcomas. It is cost-effective and minimally invasive. Furthermore, identifying alkaline-phosphatase-negative malignant mesenchymal cells from a bone aspiration may rule out osteosarcoma, whereas alkaline-phosphatase-positive malignant mesenchymal cells are suggestive of osteosarcoma.

AB  - Abstract Background Accurate localization of bone surfaces remains a challenge hampering adoption of ultrasound guidance in computer-assisted orthopaedic surgery. Local phase image features have recently been proven efficacious for segmenting bone surfaces from ultrasound images, but the quality of the processing depends on numerous filter parameters that are currently set through a trial and error process that is tedious, unintuitive and subject to large inter-user variability. Methods A method is presented for automatically selecting parameters of Log-Gabor filters used to extract bone surfaces from 3D ultrasound volumes that is based on properties estimated directly from the specific image. Results A 15% and 69% average improvement in bone surface localization accuracy on phantom and clinical data, respectively, is demonstrated compared with empirically-set parameters. Conclusions These findings imply that Log-Gabor filter parameter optimization is necessary for accurate extraction of bone surfaces from ultrasound data. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Background Blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI) occurs in 0.2?2.7% of blunt trauma patients and has up to 30% mortality. Conventional screening does not recognize up to 20% of BCVI patients. To improve diagnosis of BCVI, both an expanded battery of screening criteria and a multi-detector computed tomography angiography (CTA) have been suggested. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the use of CTA restricted to the Denver protocol screen-positive patients would reduce the unnecessary use of CTA as a pre-emptive screening tool. Methods This is a registry-based study of blunt trauma patients admitted to Auckland City Hospital from 1998 to 2012. The diagnosis of BCVI was confirmed or excluded with CTA, magnetic resonance angiography and, if these imaging were non-conclusive, four-vessel digital subtraction angiography. Results Thirty (61%) BCVI and 19 (39%) non-BCVI patients met eligibility criteria. The Denver protocol applied to our cohort of patients had a sensitivity of 97% (95% confidence interval (CI): 83?100%) and a specificity of 42% (95% CI: 20?67%). With a prevalence of BCVI in blunt trauma patients of 0.2% and 2.7%, post-test odds of a screen-positive test were 0.03 (95% CI: 0.002?0.005) and 0.046 (95% CI: 0.314?0.068), respectively. Conclusions Application of the CTA to the Denver protocol screen-positive trauma patients can decrease the use of CTA as a pre-emptive screening tool by 95?97% and reduces its hazards.

AB  - Traumatic colorectal injuries are common during times of military conflict, and major improvements in their care have arisen in such periods. Since World War II, many classification systems for colorectal trauma have been proposed, including (i) Flint Grading System; (ii) Penetrating Abdominal Trauma Index; (iii) Colonic/Rectal Injury Scale; and (iv) destructive/non-destructive colonic injuries. The primary goal of these classifications was to aid surgical management and, more particularly, to determine whether a primary repair or faecal diversion should be performed. Primary repair is now the preferred surgical option. Patients who have been identified as having destructive injuries have been found to have higher anastomotic leak rates after a primary repair. Damage control principles need to be adhered to in surgical decision-making. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of injury, classifications, clinical presentation and current recommendations for the management of colorectal trauma.

AB  - ABSTRACT Tendon injuries are very common and disrupt the transmission of forces from muscle to bone, leading to impaired function and quality of life. Successful restoration of tendon function after injury is a challenging clinical problem due to the pathological, scar-mediated manner in which the tendons heal. Currently, there are no standard treatments to modulate scar tissue formation and improve tendon healing. A major limitation to the identification of therapeutic candidates has been the reliance on terminal endpoint metrics of healing in pre-clinical studies, which require a large number of animals and result in destruction of the tissue. To address this limitation, we have identified quantification of scar tissue volume (STV) from ultrasound (US) imaging as a longitudinal, non-invasive metric of tendon healing. STV was strongly correlated with established endpoint metrics of gliding function including gliding resistance and metatarsophalangeal (MTP) flexion angle. However, no associations were observed between STV and structural or material properties. To define the sensitivity of STV to identify differences between functionally discrete tendon healing phenotypes, we utilized S100a4 haploinsufficient mice (S100a4GFP/+), which heal with improved gliding function relative to wild-type (WT) littermates. A significant decrease in STV was observed in S100a4GFP/+ repairs, relative to WT at day 14. Taken together, these data suggest US quantification of STV as a means to facilitate the rapid screening of biological and pharmacological interventions to improve tendon healing, and identify promising therapeutic targets, in an efficient, cost-effective manner. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Background The optimal time at which to perform obstetric ultrasound remains controversial. Late first trimester imaging offers the possibility for early diagnosis of structural and genetic abnormalities. Three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS) allows the entire first trimester conceptus to be contained within one or two volumes of data. Subsequent processing of this data allows optimized views of the fetus, placenta and cord to be obtained. Method Late first trimester (?12?week) pregnancies were imaged with transvaginal 3DUS. A fetal structural survey was performed, standard biometry obtained and nuchal translucency thickness (NTT) measured. The time taken to perform and assess the scans was recorded. Results A comprehensive fetal survey was obtained, fetal measurements made and NTT measured in most fetuses with average scan times of less than one minute and average volume assessment times of less than 10?min in all cases. There were no abnormal findings in this series. Conclusion 3DUS appears to be a useful tool in the ultrasound evaluation of the 12?week fetus. A detailed examination of the fetus may be performed with minimal scan time offering exciting possibilities for the use of transvaginal 3DUS as a ?one step? screening examination.

On computed tomographic examination, lesions within the pituitary fossa and structures adjacent to the right guttural pouch were identified. Soft tissue swelling was seen in the dorsal aspect of the right guttural pouch surrounding several cranial nerves, with fluid-like material in the dependent portions of the right guttural pouch. A CSF sample revealed mild mixed pleocytosis and increased protein concentration. The horse had concurrent periapical disease of the 209-cheek tooth and mild left sinusitis. The horse's demeanour deteriorated requiring euthanasia. Post-mortem examination revealed a pituitary gland abscess.

AB  - Summary Traumatic accidents are responsible for almost half of deaths of children between the ages of 1 and 14 years. Motor vehicles are most commonly involved, with pedestrian accidents being a leading cause in the 5?9-year age group. Injuries to the urinary tract and associated complications remain a source of significant morbidity following trauma in the pediatric age group. The kidney is also the most commonly injured abdominal organ in children. This chapter reviews the presentation and evaluation of pediatric traumatic injuries of the kidney and evaluates current treatment options. The current evolving literature on nonoperative management of even high-grade renal injuries is reviewed. Ureteral and bladder trauma will also be reviewed.

AB  - Introduction:? Bell?s palsy is a commonly encountered paralysis of the facial nerve occurring worldwide. Prognosis for Bell?s palsy is good, but the proportion of patients with poor outcomes may reach 30%. Ultrasound (US) may provide a novel approach for evaluating and prognosticating Bell?s palsy, in comparison with known electrophysiological techniques. Methods:? In this study, we measured the diameter of the distal facial (VII) nerve using US in patients with Bell?s palsy treated with prednisolone, in comparison with healthy controls. Blink reflex and VII nerve conduction studies were also performed. Studies were prospective and performed within 1?week of disease onset. Results:? Our results have shown that diameter of the distal VII nerve is a good predictor of favorable (positive predictive value: 100%) and bad outcomes (negative predictive value: 77%) in Bell?s palsy at 3?months after clinical presentation. Furthermore, we also noted the lack of correlation of VII diameter with conventional VII nerve conduction studies (NCS) and blink reflex studies. US was superior to VII nerve conduction and blink reflex studies in outcome prediction. Conclusions:? This first study utilizing US in Bell?s palsy highlights its role in outcome prediction and contributes to our understanding of recovery processes in this common neurological disorder.

AB  - Objective Fetal lung anomalies are traditionally classified into Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation (CCAM), and Pulmonary Sequestration (PS). During last years we have detected several cases who presented with bizarre and overlapping findings which could not be fitted into this usual classification. We therefore suggest a new approach for classification based on embryology, 2-D and Doppler ultrasound. Method During 5-year period, patients with fetal lung lesions who were referred for detailed ultrasound evaluation at the Sheba Medical Center from the data base of this study. All cases were analyzed by 2-D ultrasound and high resolution Power Doppler technology and were classified into three major categories: I Agenesis of lung; II Lung lesion with normal vascular supply: IIa solid, IIb cystic, IIc mixed; III Lung Lesion with abnormal vascular supply: IIIa chest, IIIb abdomen, IIIc thoracoabdomial. Medical files, natural history and neonatal follow-up were recorded. Results Twenty-one fetuses were recruited, two fetuses were detected in group one, 14 in group II of normal vascular supply, and five in group III abnormal lung with abnormal vascular involvement. Conclusions Based on embryology and ultrasound a new classification system is introduced.
