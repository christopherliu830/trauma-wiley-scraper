AB  - Summary Imaging, plain and contrast-enhanced, and uroendoscopy is essential to interventional evaluation and treatment of the urinary tract of dog and cat, and are often best used in combination. This chapter explains the indications, procedures, complications, and interpretation of some of the most common imaging studies performed for the urinary tract. Excretory urography (EU) may be performed using traditional radiography, fluoroscopy, or computed tomography (CT). Contraindications of these techniques are related to the use of intravenous injection of iodinated contrast media and the need for sedation or general anesthesia. There are three phases of the excretory urogram: vascular, nephrogram, and pyelogram. Contrast cystography allows for visualization of the urinary bladder, assessment of bladder wall integrity, thickness and contour, and the investigation of intraluminal abnormalities such as cystoliths and masses. The urinary bladder should be evaluated for normal margination, shape, location, and lack of contrast media extravasation.

AB  - Overview Melanoma comprises a wide variety of malignant cell types arising from the skin, the mucous membranes, and the pigmented cells of the eye. While these tumors are all classified as melanoma and share a common molecular biology of pigmentation and biological resemblance to cells of neural crest origin, important distinctions in other molecular characteristics and patterns of exposure to ultraviolet light as a carcinogen determine their clinical natural history, including the response to therapeutic interventions. While the majority of melanomas are diagnosed at an early stage and curable with minimal surgery, melanoma has the potential for early and widespread dissemination via lymphatic and hematogenous routes. Surgery remains the mainstay of therapy for primary, regional, and many cases of single- or oligo-metastatic disease, but systemic therapies have dramatically improved the prognosis for metastatic melanoma, particularly immunotherapies that enhance existing cellular immunity. The rapid discovery of new molecular targets, immunotherapy combinations (including the use of radiotherapy), and understanding of the mechanisms of therapeutic resistance are likely to lead to even greater improvements in the prognosis for patients with melanoma in the near future.

AB  - Postoperative liver failure is a rare complication after living donor liver resection. This is a case report of a 22-year-old healthy donor who was rescued with liver transplantation 11 days after right hemihepatectomy. Nine months later the patient is alive, and has fully recovered from his multiple organ failure. According to a review of the literature, there are four additional living liver donors, who received a liver transplant. Our own patient is the only survivor, so far. This case demonstrates that even in supposedly healthy living donors postoperative complications cannot be completely prevented. Although liver failure is rare in these patients, timely transplantation may need to be considered as the only life-saving treatment.

AB  - Abstract One hundred and forty-seven patients with splenic injury admitted to 18 different hospitals were included in a prospective multicentre study. The spleen was saved in 64 per cent. Out of the total series, 43 per cent of patients were not operated upon, 5 per cent had exploratory laparotomy only, and in 16 per cent splenic repair was performed. Treatment is discussed with reference to the nature of the splenic lesion, concomitant injuries, amount of blood transfusion given, and age of the patient. No deaths were definitely related to the splenic injury. The frequency of serious recurrent bleeding was not higher in the splenic salvage group when compared with the splenectomy group. Delayed bleeding was detected in 4 per cent of the patients. The mode of treatment varied considerably in different hospitals in that conservative treatment was performed in 14, splenic repair in 10 and splenectomy in 12 hospitals. Splenic salvage seems safe in most patients with a splenic injury. However, meticulous surveillance of the patient is mandatory.

AB  - Summary Vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) is a developing field for the reconstruction of multi-tissue defects unable to be ameliorated with autologous tissue. Thus far, over 90 patients have received a VCA worldwide. Although individual immunosuppression regimens vary, most patients are maintained on multi-drug regimens. As anticipated, metabolic, infectious, oncologic, and psychosocial complications have been reported in VCA recipients. The relatively few number of cases performed to date and the absence of uniformity in the reporting of results hinder the establishment of the long-term outcomes of VCAs. This chapter aims to review the reported outcomes and highlight the ongoing challenges and opportunities available in this emerging field of transplantation.

AB  - A two-year-old, neutered male domestic shorthair cat was evaluated for a history of urate calculi, and neurologic signs. Diagnostic imaging revealed an elongated and tortuous single extrahepatic portosystemic shunt which appeared to receive normal tributaries of the caudal vena cava. Surgical correction of the shunt was carried out using cellophane banding. Eight months following surgery, clinical signs had resolved. Computed tomographic angiography allows thorough, rapid imaging of complex vascular anomalies to aid proper surgical correction. Errors in the formation of the portal vein and caudal vena cava can produce complex anomalies of the abdominal vasculature. Persistence of the embryologic left subcardinal vein is proposed to account for the lesion.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes various abdominal vein thromboses, their clinical implications, and strategies of treatment. Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is a heterogeneous group of diseases that includes hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome, BCS), portal (PVT), splenic and mesenteric vein thrombosis (MVT). The optimal management of SVT requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes hepatologists, experts on thrombosis, radiologists and surgeons. In the paediatric population, renal vein thrombosis (RVT) is the most prevalent non catheter-related thrombosis during the neonatal period. For patients with RVT, a medical therapy, instead of a surgical approach (thrombectomy or nephrectomy), is recommended. Ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) is a rare condition most commonly diagnosed in the post-partum period. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) followed by vitamin K antagonists (VKA) are generally recommended for 3-6 months in the presence of transient risk factors, whereas a prolonged duration is suggested for idiophatic OVT, cancer-related OVT, and in patients with severe thrombophilia abnormalities.

AB  - Summary The 4th Haemophilia Global Summit was held in Potsdam, Germany, in September 2013 and brought together an international faculty of haemophilia experts and delegates from multidisciplinary backgrounds. The programme was designed by an independent Scientific Steering Committee of haemophilia experts and explored global perspectives in haemophilia care, discussing practical approaches to the optimal management of haemophilia now and in the future. The topics outlined in this supplement were selected by the Scientific Steering Committee for their relevance and potential to influence haemophilia care globally. In this supplement from the meeting, Jan Astermark reviews current understanding of risk factors for the development of inhibitory antibodies and discusses whether this risk can be modulated and minimized. Factors key to the improvement of joint health in people with haemophilia are explored, with Carlo Martinoli and Víctor Jiménez-Yuste discussing the utility of ultrasound for the early detection of haemophilic arthropathy. Other aspects of care necessary for the prevention and management of joint disease in people with haemophilia are outlined by Thomas Hilberg and Sébastian Lobet, who highlight the therapeutic benefits of physiotherapy and sports therapy. Riitta Lassila and Carlo-Federico Perno describe current knowledge surrounding the risk of transmission of infectious agents via clotting factor concentrates. Finally, different types of extended half-life technology are evaluated by Mike Laffan, with a focus on the practicalities and challenges associated with these products.
