AB  - Objective To evaluate the minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy (MIP) system for renal calculi. Patients and Methods Consecutive patients undergoing mini-percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mPCNL) procedures with the MIP system were enrolled. Patient position, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, puncture location, stone clearance, postoperative drainage and complications were recorded, and features unique to MIP were noted. Results In all, 30 patients underwent 32 mPCNL procedures. The mean stone size was 17 (10.75?21.25) mm and the mean number of stones was 1 (1?2). The median stone clearance rate was 96.5 (95?100)%. The complication rate was 9.3%. No patient required a transfusion. In addition to these outcomes, we noted that the MIP system has many advantages over conventional PCNL (cPCNL). It is easy to learn and can be performed in both supine and prone positions. It is safe for supracostal puncture, provides excellent access to nearly all calyces and upper ureter, has multiple stone treatment options, can be used as an adjunct to cPCNL, and can be performed as a tubeless procedure. Conclusion Our experience with the MIP system has shown several advantages over cPCNL. mPCNL with the MIP system has several features that suggest it should be considered as an alternative or adjunct to cPCNL, ureteroscopy and extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Few studies have prospectively evaluated recovery process and long-term consequences of pleural space infections. Objective To evaluate clinical, pulmonary, and diaphragmatic function and radiological outcome in patients hospitalized with pleural empyema. Material and Methods Previously healthy patients from 6 to 16 years were enrolled. Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were registered. At hospital discharge, and every 30 days or until normalization, patients underwent a clinical evaluation, diaphragmatic ultrasound, and lung function testing. Chest radiographs were performed at subsequent visits only if abnormalities persisted. Results Thirty patients were included. Nineteen (63%) were male, with an age of (mean?±?SD) 9.7?±?3.2 years, and body mass index (mean?±?SD) 18.6?±?3. Twelve patients (40%) were treated with chest tube drainage only, 12 (40%) exclusively with surgery, and 6 (20%) completed treatment with surgery due to an ineffective chest tube drainage. At hospital discharge, 26 (87%) of patients had abnormal breath sounds at the site of infection, 28 (93%) had a spirometric restrictive pattern, 19 (63%) diaphragmatic motion impairment, and 29 (97%) presented radiological involvement of pleural space, mainly pleural thickening. All patients had recovered diaphragmatic motion and were asymptomatic at 90- and 120-day follow-up control, respectively. Then, with a great individual variability, radiological findings, and lung function returned to normal at 60 days (range 30?180) and 90 days (range 30?180) after hospital discharge, respectively. Conclusion Patients with pleural empyema had a complete and progressive recovery, with initial clinical and diaphragmatic motion normalization followed by radiological and lung function recovery.

AB  - Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation-18 (CTOT-18) is a follow-up analysis of the 200-subject multicenter heart transplant CTOT-05 cohort. CTOT-18 aimed to identify clinical, epidemiologic, and biologic markers associated with adverse clinical events past 1 year posttransplantation. We examined various candidate biomarkers including serum antibodies, angiogenic proteins, blood gene expression profiles, and T cell alloreactivity. The composite endpoint (CE) included death, retransplantation, coronary stent, myocardial infarction, and cardiac allograft vasculopathy. The mean follow-up was 4.5 ± SD 1.1 years. Subjects with serum anti-cardiac myosin (CM) antibody detected at transplantation and at 12 months had a higher risk of meeting the CE compared to those without anti-CM antibody (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.9, P = .046). Plasma VEGF-A and VEGF-C levels pretransplant were associated with CE (odds ratio [OR] = 13.24, P = .029; and OR = 0.13, P = .037, respectively). Early intravascular ultrasound findings or other candidate biomarkers were not associated with the study outcomes. In conclusion, anti-CM antibody and plasma levels of VEGF-A and VEGF-C were associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Although this multicenter report supports further evaluation of the mechanisms through which anti-CM antibody and plasma angiogenesis proteins lead to allograft injury, we could not identify additional markers of adverse events or potential novel therapeutic targets.

Prognostic models for mortality and disease recurrence were developed with multivariate binary logistic regression. Results The proposed prognostic model for tumor recurrence risk after surgery in percentage (AUROC?=?0.774, 95%CI?=?0.611?0.937) is: Risk in %?=?Exp(Y)/(1?+?Exp(Y)), with Y?=??4.360?+?(0.015???tumor diameter in cm)?+?(0.010???preoperative platelet count in thousand/?l)?+?(1.077???distant metastases, if yes?=?1; if no?=?0)?+?(?0.026???Ki-67-positive cells in %)?+?(?1.086???upper abdominal pain, if yes?=?1; if no?=?0). The proposed prognostic model for observed 3-year survival probability after surgery in % (AUROC?=?0.932, 95%CI?=?0.857?0.999) is: Survival probability in %?=?Exp(Y)/(1?+?Exp(Y)), with Y?=??12.492?+?(0.054???preoperative platelet count in thousand/?l)?+?(0.112???minimal distance of the resection margin from the tumor in mm)?+?(?1.574???number of positive lymph nodes)?+?(2.292???histological tumor infiltration, if yes?=?1; if no?=?0) Conclusions The platelet count was identified as a relevant risk factor.

AB  - Data on postoperative chylous ascites (CA) after pediatric liver transplantation (LT) are scarce. This retrospective study was conducted to identify the incidence, risk factors, management, and outcomes of postoperative CA in a large single-center pediatric LT cohort (2000-2016). The study cohort comprised 317 LTs (153 living donors and 164 deceased donors) in 310 recipients with a median age of 2.7 years. The incidence of CA was 5.4% (n = 17), diagnosed after a median time of 10 days after LT. Compared with chylomicron detection in peritoneal fluid (the gold standard), a triglyceride cutoff value of 187 mg/dL in peritoneal fluid showed insufficient sensitivity (31%) for CA diagnosis. In univariate logistic regression analyses, ascites before LT, younger age, and lower weight, height, and height-for-age z score at LT were associated with CA. Symptomatic management of CA included peritoneal drain (100%) and diuretics (76%). Therapeutic interventions included very low-fat or medium-chain triglyceride?rich diets (94%) and intravenous octreotide (6%), leading to CA resolution in all patients. CA was associated with prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS; 40 days in the CA group versus 24 days in the non-CA group; P = 0.001) but not with reduced patient or graft survival rates after a median follow-up time of 14 years. In conclusion, CA in the pediatric LT recipient is a relatively uncommon complication associated with increased hospital LOS and morbidity. Measurement of chylomicrons is recommended in patients with ascites that is more severe or persistent than expected. Dietary interventions are effective in most patients.

AB  - Purpose:?? Faecal incontinence (FI) is a prevalent and important multifactorial condition. Neuromodulation via implanted sacral nerve stimulators is efficacious, but as with other invasive treatment modalities is expensive and associated with significant complications. Peripheral neuromodulation of sacral nerve roots via posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) is effective in urinary incontinence, but there is minimal evidence for its use in FI. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of PTNS in FI. Methodology:?? 12 patients with FI of various causes (8 idiopathic, 3 obstetric, 1 previous anorectal surgery) underwent PTNS at a UK hospital. All were investigated with colonic imaging, anorectal physiological studies and endoanal ultrasound. Prior treatments comprised physiotherapy (12), sphincter repairs (3 biofeedback (3) and implants (1). PTNS was performed for 30 minutes, weekly for 12?weeks. Outcome measures were episodes of incontinence, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Rockwood Faecal Incontinence Quality of Life score. Results:?? Mean monthly episodes of incontinence of wind, liquid and solid before treatment were 18.77, 21.77 and 22.15 respectively. After 12?weeks? treatment this had reduced to 0.92, 0.83 and 0.83 respectively (p < 0.05). Sphincter integrity, physiology and aetiology were not shown to affect efficacy. No patient's incontinence worsened. Non-significant improvements in Anxiety and Depression and quality of life scores were also seen. Conclusions:?? This is the first UK study to demonstrate PTNS as a potentially efficacious and minimally invasive alternative treatment modality for faecal incontinence. These early results are encouraging, but we await medium and long term follow up.

AB  - Background Right ventricular (RV) function has great impact on the survival of heart transplantation recipients; therefore, careful evaluation is of high clinical importance. However, there is no standard conventional echocardiographic parameter to assess RV systolic function. Herein, we evaluated the correlation between echocardiographic parameters of RV systolic function and ejection fraction assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI RVEF) in heart transplantation recipients. Method and Results Forty-three patients with at least 6-month heart transplantation history were included in this study. Each patient had conventional echocardiography and cardiac MRI evaluation, followed by endomyocardial biopsy and right heart catheterization, which were performed in six hours. Echocardiographic parameters of RV systolic function, RV fractional area change (RV FAC), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), RV myocardial performance index, and RV global longitudinal strain, were compared with MRI RVEF (P values were <0.001, <0.3, <0.9, and <0.4, respectively). RV FAC was the only parameter to strongly correlate with MRI RVEF (r=0.747, P<0.001); and RV FAC 48.5% value had 90.5% sensitivity and 90.5% specificity to predict the pathologic reference value of MRI RVEF ≤50% (AUC:0.96; 95% CI, 0.908?1.013). Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to evaluate the correlation between the echocardiographic parameters for RV systolic function and MRI RVEF in heart transplantation recipients. RV FAC is the only parameter to correlate well with MRI RVEF, and its routine use in the follow-up of heart transplantation recipients should be considered.

AB  - Abstract Splenic ectopic pregnancy refers to the implantation of the oosperm in the spleen. If not diagnosed early, the results of this phenomenon would almost certainly be splenic rupture, which is equivalent to the spontaneous rupture of the spleen. If the patient has no history of trauma, it is difficult to diagnose this condition early and an explicit diagnosis is often obtained by exploratory laparotomy. We report the case of a 27-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital due to abdominal pain and hemorrhagic shock. Under emergency general anesthesia, gynecologist and hepatobiliary surgeons worked together to conduct an exploratory laparotomy. It was confirmed during surgery that this was ectopic pregnancy in the spleen, which caused rupture of the spleen. Hence, splenectomy was conducted. Postoperative recovery was good.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a quality improvement (QI) program in reducing vascular complications during cardiac catheterization. Background Vascular access complications during cardiac catheterization are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. We implemented a QI program focused on using micropuncture techniques and targeting the ?safe zone,? an area below the inferior border of the inferior epigastric artery and above the inferior border of the femoral head, for femoral artery puncture. Methods Our catheterization laboratory implemented a protocol that required all operators to use micro puncture technique during diagnostic and/or percutaneous coronary interventions and to document arteriotomy in the ?safe zone.? We also encouraged use of vascular ultrasound, radial artery approach, and increased use of vascular closure devices (VCDS). We analyzed data on 3120 patients (2013, pre-QI cohort) and 3222 patients (2014, QI cohort). Data on vascular complications were prospectively collected and compared with the rate of complications that occurred during the same time one year prior when the QI project was not in effect. Results Baseline characteristics of two cohorts of patients were similar. Compliance with the protocol was excellent. Appropriate documentation of the wire exiting the needle was observed in 95% of cases. VCD use increased from 35% in 2013 to 60% in 2014 (P?<?0.001) There were no significant differences in the overall number of complications after implementation of the QI project (1.03% complications before QI implementation and 0.96% after QI implementation. P?=?0.79) but there was an absolute reduction in the number of hematomas (0.77 vs. 0.40% in 2013 vs. 2014, respectively, P?=?0.06) and of pseudoaneurysms (0.35 vs. 0.19% P?=?0.20). Correlates of major vascular complications included), age?>?75 years (HR 3.1, P?<?0.0001), and PCI (vs. diagnostic cath). Conclusions Micropuncture technique in association with ?safe zone targeting ?did not significantly reduce vascular complications in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, but a trend toward decrease of hematomas and pseudoaneurysms was noted. Factors such as age and type of procedure (PCI vs. diagnostic) play a significant role in the occurrence of vascular complications. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary An abdominal wall defect created by intentionally leaving an abdominal incision open at the completion of surgery, or by opening or re-opening the abdomen for abdominal compartment syndrome. Abdominal wall tissue loss following trauma or tumour also produces significant defects. This chapter first presents some key notes on management of the open abdomen. It then discusses perineal reconstruction and hypospadias. Perineal reconstruction is indicated in these circumstances: extensive skin loss; vaginal resection; pelvic or perineal dead space; excision of the pelvic floor; and excision after radiotherapy. The chapter also presents brief discussions of bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex, ambiguous genitalia, vaginal agenesis and penile reconstruction.
