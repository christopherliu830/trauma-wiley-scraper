AB  - Summary.? Background:?Whether atherosclerotic disease predisposes to venous thrombosis is uncertain. Objective:?To determine whether subclinical atherosclerosis, manifested as increased carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) or presence of carotid plaque, is associated with increased incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Patients and methods:?The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study is a prospective cohort of adults aged 45?64?years, examined at baseline (1987?89) and followed for cardiovascular events. Bilateral carotid ultrasound for IMT measurements was done at baseline for portions of the common and internal carotid arteries, and carotid bifurcation and also to detect the presence of carotid plaque. Exclusion criteria included baseline anticoagulant use, history of coronary heart disease, stroke, or VTE, and incomplete data. First VTE during follow-up was validated using abstracted medical records. Results:?Among 13?081 individuals followed for a mean of 12.5?years, 225 first VTE events were identified. Unadjusted hazard ratios (HR) (95% CI) of VTE across quartiles of baseline IMT were 1.0, 1.16 (0.77?1.75), 1.64 (1.12?2.40), and 1.52 (1.03?2.25). However, this association disappeared after adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity (HRs: 1.0, 1.06, 1.40, and 1.18). Further adjustment for body mass index and diabetes weakened the relative risks even further. Presence of carotid plaque at baseline also was not associated with VTE occurrence; adjusted HR?=?0.97, 95% CI?=?0.72?1.29. Conclusion:?Increased carotid IMT or presence of carotid plaque was not associated with an increased incidence of VTE in this middle-aged cohort, suggesting subclinical atherosclerosis itself is not a VTE risk factor.

AB  - Purpose? Endometriosis is defined as the presence of aberrant endometrial tissue outside of the uterus that responds to stimulation by ovarian hormones. A large, circumscribed mass of such tissue is commonly termed an endometrioma. Abdominal wall endometriomas in association with caesarean section scars have been reported repeatedly in the obstetrics and gynaecology literature, but rarely in general surgical journals. Methodology? In this paper, six patients are reviewed who presented between 2001 and 2006 with painful, tender nodules in and around caesarean section scars. Of these, four reported exacerbation of symptoms during, or just prior to menstruation. One patient had experienced 12 years of symptoms, previously attributed to intra-abdominal adhesions. Results? All patients had their scar nodules excised. Five procedures were performed electively. One patient underwent emergency exploration of her caesarean scar for possible incarcerated incisional hernia. Ectopic endometrial tissue was seen in the histological specimens of all patients. Four patients reported resolution of their symptoms following surgery. One patient had ongoing symptoms post-operatively, with an additional mass lesion seen on ultrasound consistent with a second endometrioma. One patient did not attend follow-up. Conclusion? General surgeons are commonly required to assess and manage abdominal wall masses, and should have an awareness of endometrioma in the differential diagnosis when such a lesion is seen in association with a caesarean section scar. Wide excision is usually very effective at alleviating symptoms of abdominal wall endometrioma.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the transfusion, hemostasis, and coagulation. In patients receiving massive transfusion, studies show a survival advantage in patients who received a high ratio of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to packed red blood cell (PRBC) during initial resuscitation. Studies originating from the military and civilian experience found that the optimal ratio of FFP:PRBC transfusion may be as high as 1:1. A prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing a transfusion ratio of 1:1:1 FFP:platelet:PRBC versus a 1:1:2 ratio demonstrated improved hemostasis and fewer deaths from hemorrhage by 24 hours in the 1:1:1 group. There was no increase in respiratory complications in the 1:1:1 group, despite prior retrospective associations between increased FFP transfusion and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is characterized by widespread microvascular thrombosis with activation of the coagulation system and impaired protein synthesis, leading to exhaustion of clotting factors and platelets.

AB  - Abstract Background Clinically unsuspected venous thromboembolic events (uVTE) detected during routine imaging pose a management challenge due to limited knowledge about their clinical significance. Unsuspected VTE are often referred as ?asymptomatic?, ?incidental? or ?clinically silent/occult? VTE. Objective Understand the epidemiology, management, and outcomes of uVTE in children. Methods A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. The search criteria included controlled vocabulary and keywords for VTE, incidental findings, and children (ages ≤21 years). Results Among 10,875 articles, 51 studies (7597 children with 758 uVTE) were selected. The studies were heterogeneous, I2 96%; p <.0001. Unsuspected VTE were diagnosed in two settings: first, asymptomatic VTE (aVTE) diagnosed through surveillance imaging for VTE [45 studies; n=5869; aVTE: 715, pooled frequency:19%, 95% CI:13- 24%]; second, incidental VTE (iVTE) diagnosed during imaging performed for indications without primary suspicion for VTE [6 studies; n=2460; iVTE: 43]. Majority (94%) of aVTE were associated with central venous lines (CVL). Non-CVL settings included post-spinal surgery, post-splenectomy, trauma, nephrotic syndrome and newborns. In general, aVTE were reported to have a benign clinical course, were mostly transient, and resolved without intervention and with few immediate or long-term functional complications. Incidental VTE were primarily detected in children with cancer and ranged from tumor-associated thrombi to pulmonary embolism (PE) with insufficient evidence to draw meaningful conclusions about their management. Conclusion Clinically uVTE were predominantly diagnosed with CVL and their outcomes were generally favorable implying limited benefit of routine surveillance and thromboprophylaxis. Prospective research is needed to clarify the optimal management of iVTE.

AB  - An eight-year-old, neutered male Burmese cat presented with five days vomiting and anorexia. Physical examination, clinical pathology and diagnostic imaging findings suggested a perirenal pseudocyst. After partial resection of the perirenal capsule clinical signs temporarily resolved, but the cat was euthanased 34 days postoperatively as a result of seizures and recurrence of vomiting. Postoperative histopathology showed neoplastic transitional cells within and lining the resected perirenal capsule; a diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma was confirmed post-mortem. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of this presentation of transitional cell carcinoma. Transitional cell carcinoma should be a differential diagnosis for the aetiology of perirenal pseudocyst.

AB  - Abstract Background The Safe Passage Study is a large, prospective, multidisciplinary study designed to (1) investigate the association between prenatal alcohol exposure, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and stillbirth, and (2) determine the biological basis of the spectrum of phenotypic outcomes from exposure, as modified by environmental and genetic factors that increase the risk of stillbirth, SIDS, and in surviving children, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Methods The results provided are based on an interim assessment of 6004 women enrolled, out of the 12?000 projected, from the Northern Plains, US, and Cape Town, South Africa, areas known to be of high risk for maternal drinking during pregnancy. Research objectives, study design, and descriptive statistics, including consent, recruitment, and retention information, are provided. Results Overall visit compliance is 87%, and includes prenatal, delivery/newborn, and postnatal contacts through 1 year post-delivery. Pregnancy outcome ascertainment is 98% prior to medical chart review; less than 2% of women withdraw. Consent for the use of DNA and placental tissue exceed 94%, and consent to participate in the autopsy portion of the study is 71%. Conclusions The Safe Passage Study is the first multi-site study of SIDS and stillbirth to integrate prospectively collected exposure information with multidisciplinary biological information in the same maternal and fetal/infant dyad using a common protocol. Essential components of the study design and its success are close ties to the community and rigorous systems and processes to ensure compliance with the study protocol and procedures.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To evaluate and compare the clinical effects of dexmedetomidine (DEX) and medetomidine (MED) in cats, and their reversal with atipamezole (ATI). Study design? Prospective blinded randomized multi-centre clinical trial. Animals? One hundred and twenty client-owned cats. Methods? Cats were randomly allocated to receive a single intramuscular (IM) injection of either DEX (0.04?mg?kg?1, n?=?62) or MED (0.08?mg?kg?1, n?=?58) for minor procedures requiring sedation and analgesia. Afterwards, ATI (0.2?mg?kg?1) was administered IM to half the cats, randomly assigned. Prior to, during and after the procedure the sedative, analgesic and cardiorespiratory effects and body temperature were assessed. Results? Dexmedetomidine and MED produced clinically and statistically comparable effects. The intended procedure(s) could be performed in over 90% of cats. Sedation and analgesia were apparent within 5?minutes, peak effects were observed at approximately 30?minutes and spontaneous recovery occurred by 180?minutes of injection. Heart and respiratory rate and body temperature decreased significantly over time and had not returned to baseline values 180?minutes after administration. ATI administration completely reversed the sedative and analgesic effects, returned the heart rate to normal and prevented any further reductions in respiratory rate and body temperature in both DEX- and MED-treated cats. The reporting of adverse events was low and the most commonly observed event was vomiting (7%). No serious adverse events or concerns regarding safety were reported. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Dexmedetomidine (0.04?mg?kg?1) produced comparable sedative and analgesic effects to MED (0.08?mg?kg?1) in cats. DEX produced adequate sedation and analgesia for radiography, grooming, dental care and lancing of abscesses. ATI fully reversed the clinical effects of DEX.

AB  - EB is a recessive condition caused by a defect in collagen 7 production, such that epithelial cells do not adhere adequately to the underlying basement membranes. Minor mechanical trauma and stress forces will cause recurrent blistering of the skin and mucosal surfaces, which heal by scarring. The hand suffers particularly badly, and a characteristic mitten deformity of scar tissue is a common stigmata of the disease. We report a 51 year old survivor of EB with a bilateral mitten hand deformity that had been present since the age of 6 years. Extensive surgical release of the dominant left hand was undertaken, resurfacing the created defects with split skin grafts under regional anaesthesia. Fingers that had been buried for 45 years were straightened and held in place with k wires whilst the grafts were vascularising. Extensive post operative physiotherapy and splinting were undertaken, with functional improvement to the extent that the patient was able to hold a pen and write. Skin graft donor sites healed uneventfully. Extensive release of mitten hand deformity in long term survivors of EB is a worthwhile surgical procedure with good functional results. The problems of surgery and anaesthesia in this condition are discussed. Release of the second hand is planned.
