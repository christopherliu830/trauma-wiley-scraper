AB  - Objective To assess the use of local haemostatic agents (HAs) in a prospective multicentre large series of partial nephrectomies (PNs). Patients and Methods Prospective National Observational Registry on the Practices of Haemostasis in Partial Nephrectomy (NEPHRON): the study was conducted in 54 French urological centres from 1 June to 31 December 2010. In all, 570 consecutive patients undergoing a PN were enrolled in this study in a prospective manner. The data was collected prospectively via an electronic case-report form: five different sheets were included for preoperative, perioperative, postoperative and follow-up data respectively. Information related to haemostasis was analysed. Results The median patient age was 60 years and the mean (range) tumour size was 3.68 (0.19?15) cm. An HA was primarily used in 71.4% of patients, with a statistically significant difference among surgical approaches (P = 0.024). In 91.8% of cases, a single use of a HA was sufficient for achieving haemostasis. The HA was used either alone (13.9%) or in association with sutures (80.3%). One or more additional haemostatic action(s) was needed in 12.3% of the cases. When comparing patients who received a HA with those who did not receive a HA, there was no statistical difference between the groups for tumour size (P = 0.542), collecting system drainage (P = 0.538), hospital stay (P = 0.508), operation time (P = 0.169), blood loss (P = 0.387) or transfusion rate (P = 0.713). Conclusion HAs are widely used by urologists during PN. Progress is needed for standardising HA application, especially for the timing of application. For the time being, the role of the HA in nephron-sparing surgery is still to be evaluated.

AB  - Summary Biliary tract emergencies include gallstone pancreatitis, cholangitis, bile leak, and acute cholecystitis. Urgent ERCP (within 24 hours after admission) is indicated in patients with gallstone pancreatitis who have concurrent acute cholangitis, but it is not needed in most patients who do not have evidence of ongoing biliary obstruction. The treatment goal of acute cholangitis is biliary decompression by re-establishing patency of the biliary system. The primary goal of endoscopic treatment of bile leaks is directed at reducing biliary pressure. This is accomplished in several ways including performing a biliary sphincterotomy and/or placement of a bile duct stent across the papilla. The timing of cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis has been debated and is discussed in this chapter.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Although computerized decision support for imaging is often recommended for optimizing computed tomography (CT) use, no studies have evaluated emergency physicians' (EPs') preferences regarding computerized decision support in the emergency department (ED). In this needs assessment, the authors sought to determine if EPs view overutilization as a problem, if they want decision support, and if so, the kinds of support they prefer. Methods A 42-item, Web-based survey of EPs was developed and used to measure EPs' attitudes, preferences, and knowledge. Key contacts at local EDs sent letters describing the study to their physicians. Exploratory principal components analysis (PCA) was used to determine the underlying factor structure of multi-item scales, Cronbach's alpha was used to measure internal consistency of items on a scale, Spearman correlations were used to describe bivariate associations, and multivariable linear regression analysis was used to identify variables independently associated with physician interest in decision support. Results Of 235 surveys sent, 155 (66%) EPs responded. Five factors emerged from the PCA. EPs felt that: 1) CT overutilization is a problem in the ED (α = 0.75); 2) a patient's cumulative CT study count affects decisions of whether and what type of imaging study to order only some of the time (α = 0.75); 3) knowledge that a patient has had prior CT imaging for the same indication makes EPs less likely to order a CT (α = 0.42); 4) concerns about malpractice, patient satisfaction, or insistence on CTs affect CT ordering decisions (α = 0.62); and 5) EPs want decision support before ordering CTs (α = 0.85). Performance on knowledge questions was poor, with only 18% to 39% correctly responding to each of the three multiple-choice items about effective radiation doses of chest radiograph and single-pass abdominopelvic CT, as well as estimated increased risk of cancer from a 10-mSv exposure. Although EPs wanted information on patients' cumulative exposures, they feel inadequately familiar with this information to make use of it clinically. If provided with patients' cumulative radiation exposures from CT, 87% of EPs said that they would use this information to discuss imaging options with their patients. In the multiple regression model, which included all variables associated with interest in decision support at p < 0.10 in bivariate tests, items independently associated with EPs' greater interest in all types of decision support proposed included lower total knowledge scores, greater frequency that cumulative CT study count affects EP's decision to order CTs, and greater agreement that overutilization of CT is a problem and that awareness of multiple prior CTs for a given indication affects CT ordering decisions. Conclusions Emergency physicians view overutilization of CT scans as a problem with potential for improvement in the ED and would like to have more information to discuss risks with their patients. EPs are interested in all types of imaging decision support proposed to help optimize imaging ordering in the ED and to reduce radiation to their patients. Findings reveal several opportunities that could potentially affect CT utilization.

AB  - Summary Ureteral obstructions are a major clinical problem in small animal veterinary patients most commonly associated with ureteroliths, ureteral strictures, and trigonal neoplasia of the ureterovesicular junction (UVJ). With the invasiveness and morbidity associated with traditional surgical treatments, interventional options have become the mainstay of treatment in the author's practice. The main treatment options discussed in this chapter are the use of nephrostomy tubes, ureteral stents, and subcutaneous ureteral bypass devices (SUB). Ureteral stenting is most commonly accomplished using endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance in canine patients, and surgically-assisted with fluoroscopy in feline patients. These devices are used for a variety of obstructive disorders in both dogs and cats. The main type of ureteral stent used in veterinary medicine is an indwelling soft double pigtail ureteral stent that can remain in place for numerous months to years if necessary.

AB  - A simple and rapid technique for the emergency removal of lung lobes was developed. It has been used successfully in 2 cats and 10 dogs without complications being recognized in any, with a minimum follow-up of four months. The purpose of this abstract is three-fold: 1) To briefly describe how the technique was done; 2) To describe the results of the use of the technique in these 14 emergency cases; and 3) Provide recommendations for the continued use of the technique in emergency cases. Method: The lung lobe requiring removal was selected and elevated; soft connective tissues around the lung lobe base were separated from the main pedicle using a fine curved scissors. With mild traction applied, 3 curved Halstead or Kelly hemostatic forceps were applied across the entire pedicle, one right after the other except for a break between the last 2 distal clamps. The lung lobe was removed by cutting the entire pedicle with a Metzenbaum scissors between the distal most clamps. The tips of the scissors were tilted slightly to produce a ?tissue bumper? of 1?3?mm above the distal most hemostatic forceps left. A Miller's knot of 3?0 to 2?0 polypropylene (cats and very small dogs) and 0 to 1 polypropylene (medium to large dogs) was applied around the entire pedicle under the clamps and tightened as the proximal most clamp was loosened briefly (flashed). The ends of the suture were continued to be carried around the pedicle in the direction they were coursing and then tied. A third ligation of the polypropylene was completed in large pedicles or where added security was deemed necessary such as in cases with a torn lung lobe due to trauma. Results: The procedure was used in emergency lung lobectomy in 2 cats involving 3 lobes and in 10 dogs. The reasons for emergency lobectomy were lung consolidation in 4 dogs (involving 6 lobes), trauma with severe tears or openings in 4 dogs (involving 6 lobes), a leaking congenital bulla in 1 dog, and 1 abscess/foreign body (wooden stick). Time taken to perform a lobectomy with this technique ranged from 3?7?minutes. No leaks or complications with the pedicle have been observed in any of the cases. Because only limited dissection is needed to perform the lobectomy, the author recommends this method over conventional lobectomy where artery, bronchus and vein are all managed individually.

AB  - Background Peripheral nerve blocks (PNB) are increasingly used for anaesthesia and postoperative pain control in acute orthopaedic limb surgery but rebound pain upon cessation of PNBs may challenge the benefits on the pain profile. We aimed to explore the pain profile following acute ankle fracture surgery under PNB anaesthesia and investigate if rebound pain could pose a clinical problem. Methods Exploratory, observational study of adults scheduled for acute primary internal fixation of an ankle fracture under ultrasound-guided popliteal sciatic and saphenous ropivacaine block anaesthesia. Postoperatively, patients regularly registered pain scores while receiving a fixed analgesics regimen and patient controlled morphine on-demand. We analysed morphine consumption and depicted the detailed pain profiles as graphs allowing for visual analysis of pain courses, including rebound pain. Secondly, we compared the area under the curve and peak pain between relevant age-subgroups. Results We included 21 patients aged 20-83. Depicted pain profiles reveal that PNB supplied effective and long lasting postoperative pain control, but cessation of the PNB led to intense rises in pain scores with six out of nine 20-60-year-olds reaching severe pain levels. The rebound was less pronounced in patients >60 years old, but nearly all reached moderate pain levels. Morphine consumption rates were high during the rebound. Conclusions This study thoroughly analyses the post-PNB pain profile and suggests rebound pain is a clinically relevant and problematic issue with the potential to outweigh the PNB benefits, especially for younger patients. The conclusions are tentative, and a randomised study is pending.

AB  - Summary The management of dental emergencies in the hospital environment has evolved dramatically over the past few decades. General and pediatric dentists, as well as oral and maxillofacial surgeons are now often the primary providers of care and might manage everything from a simple toothache to the most severe maxillofacial maladies and craniofacial injuries. A thorough knowledge of the organizational, triage, and treatment protocols in the emergency department greatly enhances the dentist's ability to provide rapid, appropriate, and broadly scoped emergency care. This chapter discusses, inter alia, medicolegal aspects of emergency care, intra-oral urgencies, postoperative emergencies, odontogenic infections, salivary gland emergencies, maxillofacial trauma, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) emergencies, in detail.

AB  - The aim of this study is to report our interventional radiologic procedures (IRP) in liver transplant (LTX) patients. These include procedures for biliary, arterial, venous, and portal complications, as well as the treatment of infected and non-infected fluid collections. This retrospective study covered 583 patients (mean age: 44?±?14?yr) in whom a total of 685 LTX were performed from August 1987 to April 2005. Overall, 182 LTX patients underwent a total of 428 IRP, including digital subtraction angiography (n?=?152/35.51%), percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) (n?=?4/0.93%) and PTA?+?stent (n?=?7/1.63%) of arterial anastomosis, PTA?+?stent of the celiac trunk (n?=?2/0.46%), transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) (n?=?2/0.46%), arterial lysis (n?=?4/0.93%), venous lysis (n?=?2/0.46%), inferior vena cava stenting (n?=?2/0.46%), percutaneous biliary drainage (n?=?34/7.94%), percutaneous transluminal dilatation (PTD) of the choledocho-enteric anastomosis (n?=?16/3.73%), biliary stent (n?=?5/1.16%), intrahepatic biliary flushing treatment, stone and cast biliary extraction (n?=?27/6.30%), other interventions (e.g., embolization in other regions, transjugular liver biopsies, lymphangiographies) (n?=?9/2.10%), and ultrasound- and computer tomography-guided biopsies and percutaneous drainage (n?=?153/35.74%). The overall success rate was 85.7%. Technical improvements in LTX and interventional radiology permit vascular and biliary complications to be treated successfully by interventional radiology.

AB  - Although cases of retroperitoneal effusion associated with adrenal gland neoplasia have been reported in the veterinary literature, these clinical reports have been largely anecdotal. To our knowledge, no comprehensive evaluation of the causes or clinical indications of effusion (RPE) in the retroperitoneal space exists. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the causes, presenting signs, clinical findings and outcomes associated with RPE. The records of 23 cats and 44 dogs presenting to the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine between 1996 and 2003 and having been identified with RPE were reviewed. The presence of RPE was identified using abdominal ultrasonography. All of the cats and 84% (n=38) of dogs in this study presented through the Emergency Service. Diagnoses for RPE were categorized as follows: (Group 1) 14 dogs and 3 cats with acute renal failure associated with infection; (Group 2) 5 dogs and 6 cats with acute renal failure of unknown etiology; (Group 3) 3 cats with acute renal failure due to urinary tract obstruction; (Group 4) 8 dogs with adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 5) 7 dogs and 1 cat with non-adrenal gland neoplasia; (Group 6) 5 dogs and 4 cats with other renal disease, and (Group 7) 5 dogs and 6 cats with RPF due to other causes. The most frequent presenting complaints in all categories except for those in Group 4 included anorexia, lethargy and vomiting. Physical examination findings were very similar for all categories except for those in Group 4 and included abdominal pain, dehydration, mental depression, lethargy and weakness. For those in Group 4, the most common complaints were collapse or marked weakness, anorexia, lethargy, and discomfort. The physical examination findings for dogs in Group 4 also included collapse or marked weakness, and abdominal distension. Percent mortality for dogs was 39% and, for cats, 43%. In each category, the percent mortalities are as follows (euthanized=e, died=d): Group 1: dogs: 14% (e n=1, d n=1), and cats: 33% (e n=1); Group 2: dogs: 100% (e n=4, d n=1) and cats 67% (e n=4).; Group 3: cats: 100% (e n=2, d n=1); Group 4: dogs: 32% (e n=3); Group 5: dogs: 71% (e n=5) and cats: 0%;. Group 6: dogs: 0% and cats: 25% (e n=1), and Group 7: dogs: 40% (e n=2) and cats: 17% (e n=1). Retroperitoneal effusion, regardless of cause, is associated with significant disease. In people, another category of disease associated with RPE is trauma. Although this category is not included in this study, abdominal ultrasonography of trauma victims may identify a veterinary population with RPE.

AB  - Abstract Aim? To give an overview of treatment options for dens invaginatus based on a classification system. Summary? Dens invaginatus is a dental malformation which may give endodontic complications. Treatment may vary in relation to anatomy, and a classification system for dens invaginatus forms the basis for discussion. A clinical case, classified as a type II invagination (Oehlers? classification), is also presented. Clinical and radiographic examination revealed an invagination penetrating into the apical third of the root canal in tooth number 12. The tooth was immature with an open apex, apical pathosis and a labial fistula. To control the infection, ultrasonic removal of the invagination was necessary, as the invagination prevented complete cleaning and shaping of the root canal. After chemo-mechanical preparation and dressing with calcium hydroxide, an apical plug of MTA was placed, followed by restoration of the tooth with resin-bonded composite. Healing of the lesion with hard tissue formation was confirmed at follow-up. Key learning points ??Knowledge about classification and anatomical variations of teeth with dens invaginatus is important in endodontic decision making. ??A classification system may be helpful when treatment options are considered. ??Classification of dens invaginatus requires a thorough preoperative radiographic examination.

AB  - Objective? To compare the effects of postoperative pain after ovariohysterectomy by harmonic scalpel-assisted laparoscopy (HALO) and traditional ovariohysterectomy (OVH) in dogs. Study Design? A randomized, blinded, prospective study. Sample Population? Sixteen, purpose-bred, intact female, Beagle dogs. Methods? Dogs were divided into 2 groups: Group 1 (8 dogs), which had OVH by HALO, and Group 2 (8 dogs), which had traditional OVH. Physiologic data, abdominal nociceptive threshold scores, and University of Melbourne pain scores (UMPS) were recorded at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery. Blood samples for measurement of plasma cortisol, glucose, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) concentrations were collected at the time of the incision, and 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery. Results? No significant surgical complications occurred. The HALO mean surgical time was significantly longer (55.7 minutes) than traditional OVH (31.7 minutes). No significant differences were observed between groups for the pain measures of heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, CPK, and glucose concentrations. The OVH group had significantly higher mean plasma cortisol levels at hour 2 after surgery than the HALO group (P=.0001). The mean UMPS were significantly higher in OVH than the HALO group at all postoperative times (P=.0001). The mean nociceptive threshold measurements revealed significantly higher tolerated palpation pressures in HALO than OVH at all postoperative times, except hour 72 (P=.0002). Conclusions? Dogs appeared to be in less pain with HALO than OVH. The harmonic scalpel coagulated ovarian and uterine vessels completely with minimal collateral damage to surrounding tissues. Clinical Relevance? HALO is a safe alternative to OVH and offers a minimally invasive and less painful method of surgery.

AB  - Over a long career in both ablative and reconstructive surgery in the head and neck, the author has identified certain factors which help in the management of these patients and has learned many lessons. Such lessons include the importance of multi-disciplinary management, excellence in anaesthesia, the importance of anatomy, concepts of ablative surgery such as marginal mandibular resection, and many of the concepts of reconstructive surgery which have enabled rapid one stage reconstructions, such that palliative surgery for massive tumours can be sometimes worthwhile. These and other experiences will be discussed.
