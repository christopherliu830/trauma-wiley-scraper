AB  - Over a long career in both ablative and reconstructive surgery in the head and neck, the author has identified certain factors which help in the management of these patients and has learned many lessons. Such lessons include the importance of multi-disciplinary management, excellence in anaesthesia, the importance of anatomy, concepts of ablative surgery such as marginal mandibular resection, and many of the concepts of reconstructive surgery which have enabled rapid one stage reconstructions, such that palliative surgery for massive tumours can be sometimes worthwhile. These and other experiences will be discussed.

AB  - Summary This chapter addresses the nature of disability, how it can best be ameliorated, which training techniques and medical treatments are most effective, particularly after single incident brain injury, and the organisational structures required for their optimal delivery. A holistic biopsychosocial individualised multi-dimensional rehabilitation programme includes: reiterative multi-disciplinary assessment, problem definition and measurement, goal-setting and treatment planning, treatment delivery, evaluation of effectiveness, and reassessment with a view to further treatment. Non-invasive therapy interventions and task-related training in the context of neural damage are an integral part of the rehabilitation process after a neurological event, and aim to optimise a person's functional ability. Cardio-respiratory training and exercise classes may reverse the detraining effects of immobility and reduced activity seen in many chronic conditions. Symptoms related to neurological impairments caused by either single incident or chronic progressive conditions can cause distress and impact on function.

AB  - Objectives Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is the most prevalent of the painful musculoskeletal conditions. CLBP is a heterogeneous condition with many causes and diagnoses, but there are few established therapies with strong evidence of effectiveness (or cost effectiveness). CLBP for which it is not possible to identify any specific cause is often referred to as non-specific chronic LBP (NSCLBP). One type of NSCLBP is continuing and recurrent primarily nociceptive CLBP due to vertebral joint overload subsequent to functional instability of the lumbar spine. This condition may occur due to disruption of the motor control system to the key stabilizing muscles in the lumbar spine, particularly the lumbar multifidus muscle (MF). Methods This review presents the evidence for MF involvement in CLBP, mechanisms of action of disruption of control of the MF, and options for restoring control of the MF as a treatment for NSCLBP. Results Imaging assessment of motor control dysfunction of the MF in individual patients is fraught with difficulty. MRI or ultrasound imaging techniques, while reliable, have limited diagnostic or predictive utility. For some patients, restoration of motor control to the MF with specific exercises can be effective, but population results are not persuasive since most patients are unable to voluntarily contract the MF and may be inhibited from doing so due to arthrogenic muscle inhibition. Conclusions Targeting MF control with restorative neurostimulation promises a new treatment option.

AB  - Objective? To compare the effects of postoperative pain after ovariohysterectomy by harmonic scalpel-assisted laparoscopy (HALO) and traditional ovariohysterectomy (OVH) in dogs. Study Design? A randomized, blinded, prospective study. Sample Population? Sixteen, purpose-bred, intact female, Beagle dogs. Methods? Dogs were divided into 2 groups: Group 1 (8 dogs), which had OVH by HALO, and Group 2 (8 dogs), which had traditional OVH. Physiologic data, abdominal nociceptive threshold scores, and University of Melbourne pain scores (UMPS) were recorded at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery. Blood samples for measurement of plasma cortisol, glucose, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) concentrations were collected at the time of the incision, and 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery. Results? No significant surgical complications occurred. The HALO mean surgical time was significantly longer (55.7 minutes) than traditional OVH (31.7 minutes). No significant differences were observed between groups for the pain measures of heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, CPK, and glucose concentrations. The OVH group had significantly higher mean plasma cortisol levels at hour 2 after surgery than the HALO group (P=.0001). The mean UMPS were significantly higher in OVH than the HALO group at all postoperative times (P=.0001). The mean nociceptive threshold measurements revealed significantly higher tolerated palpation pressures in HALO than OVH at all postoperative times, except hour 72 (P=.0002). Conclusions? Dogs appeared to be in less pain with HALO than OVH. The harmonic scalpel coagulated ovarian and uterine vessels completely with minimal collateral damage to surrounding tissues. Clinical Relevance? HALO is a safe alternative to OVH and offers a minimally invasive and less painful method of surgery.

AB  - Introduction? Nasal trauma in childhood is a frequent occurrence. Management of resultant fractures in the paediatric age group presents a unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The immature patient is less likely to be cooperative with examination, and clinical evaluation is difficult owing to facial oedema and lack of rigidity of the nasal bones. Subsequent nasal growth and development must be considered in determining the most appropriate treatment. Closed reduction of nasal fractures is usually undertaken at the Wellington Regional Plastic, Maxillofacial & Burns Unit at Hutt Hospital. Little exists in the form of follow-up studies assessing patient satisfaction following this technique. Methods? A retrospective chart reviewed yielded 39 patients aged under seventeen years who underwent closed reduction of their nasal fracture during the two year period ending in July 2006 at Hutt Hospital. Follow-up was between three and twenty-seven months. A structured telephone interview was carried out to assess the degree of satisfaction with both functional and aesthetic outcome present in this group. Patients and their parents were invited to respond. Results? Most patients and their families are satisfied with nasal function and appearance following closed reduction. Few had subsequently sought or would consider a secondary open procedure in the form of septorhinoplasty. Conclusion? Closed reduction remains a satisfactory treatment in this age group. On the basis of patient satisfaction, it is successful in maintaining the function and appearance of the nose in most.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the hemodynamic and respiratory monitoring. It is essential for a practitioner to understand oxygen delivery and how it can be optimized when providing adequate hemodynamic support in the critically ill patient. The rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) is the ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume. Patients who cannot tolerate independent breathing tend to breathe rapidly and shallow. Multiple factors can affect the accuracy of pulse oximetry monitors. CO-oximetry is a four wavelength non-invasive monitoring system that allows additional measurements of blood constituents. It not only measures oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, as pulse oximetry does, but also dyshemoglobins. End-tidal CO2 monitoring can help identify problems immediately after intubation and before critical hypoxemia becomes manifest. Adding lactate determinations to oxygen transport monitoring provides a more complete assessment of tissue oxygenation.

AB  - Aims 1 To re-evaluate the basic anatomy of the lymphatic vessel network in the head and neck region for diagnosis and treatment of lymphogenic cancer metastases. 2 To compare the anatomy of the lymphatic system with the venous system. 3 To investigate the possibility that extensive lymphatic-venous connections exist. Materials and Methods? The lymphatic vessels in the scalp, face and neck of 5 (ten halves) fresh human cadavers were identified by using 6% hydrogen peroxide with and without India ink, then injecting the vessels with a lead oxide, milk powder and water mixture. The specimens were photographed, radiographed and analyzed. Results? Radiographs and photographs show: 1 The lymphatic pathway ?patterns? found were different in each specimen, even each side of the same head showed considerable variation. 2 The lymphatic pathways of the anterior neck lie in the tissue above the platysma and course horizontally and obliquely. This finding confirm those found using lymphoscintigraphy 3 The discovery of lymphatic bypass routes confirms the lymphoscintigraphy findings that lymphatic drainage does not always go directly to the first tier lymph nodes. 4 We were able to compare the anatomical relationship of the lymphatic and venous systems and demonstrate that a lymphatic-venous shunt does exist in the occipital region. Conclusion? This study provides an anatomical picture of the superficial lymphatic system of the head and neck and will aid surgical management in the treatment of trauma, infection, lymphoedema and cancer.

AB  - The pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis) is an IUCN Red List Endangered species (CITES Appendix II) that has been housed in zoological collections since 1912. As wild populations continue to decline throughout the species? range, successful ex situ breeding and management, including an understanding of morbidity and mortality, are of utmost importance. This study is the first comprehensive review of mortality data from the captive population since 1982 and significantly expands on previous analyses. We solicited necropsy reports from 129/187 zoological institutions worldwide that currently or previously held pygmy hippos and received data for 404 animals (177 ?, 220 ?, 7 undermined sex), representing 43% of pygmy hippos that have died in captivity. Mortality in neonates was primarily due to perinatal causes (51.8%?stillbirth, failure to thrive, weakness, poor suckling reflex, maternal neglect) or parent-inflicted trauma (28%). Common causes of mortality in adult and geriatric animals included cardiovascular disease (16%), degenerative musculoskeletal conditions (10%), obstructive gastrointestinal disease (9%), and renal insufficiency (13%), sometimes associated with advanced polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Although not the direct cause of mortality, a number of adult and geriatric pygmy hippos were also overweight to obese. Infectious causes of mortality in included leptospirosis and encephalomyocarditis virus, the latter usually presenting as acute death due to cardiovascular demise. This comprehensive overview presents a useful guide for recommendations in preventative veterinary care and for improved husbandry and management of pygmy hippos in captivity.

AB  - Abstract This paper demonstrates the first steps towards self-healing composites that exploit a design philosophy inspired by the damage tolerance and self-repair functions of bone. Cracking in either fibre reinforced polymers (FRP) or bone, if left unattended, can grow under subsequent cyclic stresses eventually leading to catastrophic failure of the structure. On detection of cracks, an FRP component must be repaired or completely replaced, whereas bone utilises a series of complex processes to repair such damage. Under normal circumstances, these processes allow the skeleton to continually perform over the lifespan of the organism, a highly desirable aspiration for engineering materials. A simple vasculature design incorporated into a FRP via a ?lost wax? process was found to facilitate a self-healing function which resulted in an outstanding recovery (≥96%) in post-impact compression strength. The process involved infusion of a healing resin through the vascule channels. Resin egress from the backface damage, ultrasonic C-scan testing, and microscopic evaluation all provide evidence that sufficient vascule?damage connectivity exists to confer a reliable and efficient self-healing function.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? The existence of the G-spot is controversial. Aim.? To evaluate, by the use of three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasonography, the anatomic structures of the urethrovaginal space. Methods.? Nineteen (Group I) eumenorrheic young women who experienced, and 20 (Group II) who did not experience a vaginal orgasm underwent two-dimensional (2-D) and 3-D ultrasonography and color Doppler analysis of the urethrovaginal space and of the clitoris during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Main Outcome Measures.? 2-D ultrasonographic evaluation of the urethrovaginal space, and color Doppler evaluation of the urethrovaginal main feeding artery and dorsal clitoral arteries; 3-D volume calculation of the urethrovaginal space, and 3-D power Doppler analysis of vascular indices of the urethrovaginal space and clitoral body (vascularization index, flow index, vascularization flow index); hormonal evaluation. Results.? The 3-D reconstruction of the urethrovaginal space demonstrated a gland-like aspect with small feeding vessels. The total length (19.1?±?2.7?mm vs. 17.5?±?2.1?mm; P?=?0.047), measured with 2-D ultrasound, and the 3-D mean volume (0.59?±?0.13?mL vs. 0.26?±?0.07?mL; P?<?0.001) of the structures contained in the urethrovaginal space were significantly higher in Group I than in Group II. The mean time since the last intercourse was 31?±?9 hours in Group I and 18?±?3 hours (P?=?0.033) in Group II. The urethrovaginal space vascularization, the clitoral volume and vascularization, and the circulating hormonal values did not significantly differ among the two groups. The mean volume of the structures contained in the urethrovaginal space was correlated with time since intercourse (r?=?0.685; P?=?0.021) and with serum testosterone (r?=?0.637; P?=?0.032) and androstenedione (r?=?0.744; P?=?0.011). Conclusions.? The structures we observed in the urethrovaginal space have a gland-like aspect and their volume is correlated with both serum androgen concentrations and time since intercourse.

AB  - Abstract Aims: The high morbidity (28.5 per cent readmission rate) experienced whilst waiting for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) after an index admission with acute cholecystitis (AC) has been reported. Since this report a provision for emergency LC service has been made available in the same DGH. This study performed over a 12-month period (October 2000?September 2001) reports the impact of those changes on the management of AC and allows comparisons between these results and those achieved in the previous study (the control period). Methods: During the study 146 patients presented as emergency with AC. Emergency cholecytectomy was performed in 75 and the rest were waitlisted. GI surgeons performed 76 per cent of the LC whilst the non-GI surgeons listed the majority of their cases for delayed LC. Seventy-one per cent of the LC was done laparoscopically with an 18.8 per cent conversion rate; 59 per cent (44/75) cholecystectomies were performed by trainees under supervision. The number of emergency LC, conversion rates, complications, median length of total (TLOS) and postop hospital stay (PLOS) were used as end points. Results: There was a seven-fold (Table) increase in the number of cholecystectomies during their index admission in the study group. Major complications and conversion rates of LC performed in the study period (5.3 and 18 per cent) were similar to those of delayed LC in the control period (6.2 and 12 per cent). Although the TLOS was less in the study group compared to the control (table), patients with AC still had a median wait of 5 days between their admission and their cholecystectomy. Conclusions: These results document that emergency cholecystectomy service can be provided with minimal complications and a shorter hospital stay. Further improvements to reduce inhospital stay require prompt ultrasound examination and rostering of laparoscopically competent surgeons.
