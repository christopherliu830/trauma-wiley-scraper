AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the HIPO planning and optimization algorithm for real-time prostate HDR brachytherapy. This study consists of 20 patients who underwent ultrasound-based real-time HDR brachytherapy of the prostate using the treatment planning system called Oncentra Prostate (SWIFT version 3.0). The treatment plans for all patients were optimized using inverse dose-volume histogram?based optimization followed by graphical optimization (GRO) in real time. The GRO is manual manipulation of isodose lines slice by slice. The quality of the plan heavily depends on planner expertise and experience. The data for all patients were retrieved later, and treatment plans were created and optimized using HIPO algorithm with the same set of dose constraints, number of catheters, and set of contours as in the real-time optimization algorithm. The HIPO algorithm is a hybrid because it combines both stochastic and deterministic algorithms. The stochastic algorithm, called simulated annealing, searches the optimal catheter distributions for a given set of dose objectives. The deterministic algorithm, called dose-volume histogram?based optimization (DVHO), optimizes three-dimensional dose distribution quickly by moving straight downhill once it is in the advantageous region of the search space given by the stochastic algorithm. The PTV receiving 100% of the prescription dose () was 97.56% and 95.38% with GRO and HIPO, respectively. The mean dose () and minimum dose to 10% volume () for the urethra, rectum, and bladder were all statistically lower with HIPO compared to GRO using the student pair t-test at 5% significance level. HIPO can provide treatment plans with comparable target coverage to that of GRO with a reduction in dose to the critical structures. PACS number: 87.55.-X

AB  - Summary Focal cerebral ischemia, caused by a sudden occlusion of a cerebral blood vessel or sometimes just by low blood flow, initiates a series of events which can lead to irreversible neuronal damage and death (i.e. infarction) in the part of the brain supplied or drained by that vessel. Several pathophysiological cascades run in sequence (and in parallel). In the vascular system, rapid changes in platelet and coagulation factors, the vessel wall (particularly the endothelium) and in the thrombus itself interact to produce a very dynamic state, not only at the site of vessel occlusion, but also more remotely, in both the macro- and microcirculation. In brain tissue, changes occur in neurons, glial cells, and other structural components in differing degrees and at different times after the onset of ischemia, which means that cerebral infarction is a dynamic and highly unstable process, not a discrete ?one-off? event. In other words, infarction is not an ?all-or-nothing? episode which is instantaneous in onset, maximal in severity at the moment of onset, and irreversibly complete within 6 hours. This chapter begins with a review of pathophysiology, particularly aspects which relate to the specific treatments that are described later in the chapter. As far as possible, we base the decision whether or not to use a particular treatment, not merely on its putative physiological effects, but on the evidence from randomized controlled trials in patients which demonstrate the balance of clinical risk and benefit associated with its use. In view of this, the section on each of the specific treatments will assess the strength of evidence available and, where possible, base any recommendations on the results of a systematic review (and meta-analysis) of all the relevant randomized controlled trials of that particular treatment.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses asepsis and infection controls in surgical practice. Proper preparation of the surgical patient is a critical step in the surgical case and is related to the outcome and subsequent potential infection of the surgical site. Improper patient preparation can have catastrophic consequences for the surgical procedure and incision integrity. Surgical prep of veterinary patients consists of two steps: clipping (removal) of the hair/fur and skin cleansing with an antiseptic. Once the patient has received the initial prep, they are ready to be transported to the operating room. Proper positioning of the patient is a critical step in the patient prep process. Surgeons require the patient be positioned in a straight and anatomically correct fashion. Efficient use of specialize veterinary surgical instrumentation requires those using it to understand proper application, handling, care, and troubleshooting. Surgical grade instruments are generally made from stainless steel and other metal alloys such as carbon and chromium.

AB  - Abstract X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is the most common monogenic disorder causing hypophosphatemia. This case-note review documents the clinical features and the complications of treatment in 59 adults (19 male, 40 female) with XLH. XLH is associated with a large number of private mutations; 37 different mutations in the PHEX gene were identified in this cohort, 14 of which have not been previously reported. Orthopaedic involvement requiring surgical intervention (osteotomy) was frequent. Joint replacement and decompressive laminectomy were observed in those older than 40 years. Dental disease (63%), nephrocalcinosis (42%), and hearing impairment (14%) were also common. The rarity of the disease and the large number of variants make it difficult to discern specific genotype-phenotype relationships. A new treatment, an anti-FGF23 antibody, that may affect the natural history of the disease is currently being investigated in clinical trials.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this work was to investigate how a recently developed MRI-based post-implant dosimetric analysis technique for ultrasound guided transperineal interstitial permanent prostate brachytherapy (TIPPB) compared with the currently accepted CT-based technique. The study was based upon 3-mm MRI and CT scans of 15 patients who had received either 125I or 103Pd implantation. All images were acquired on post-operative day 1 and within 1 hr of each other. Prostate volumes were determined by the same physician. Sources were digitized and calculations performed using an in-house treatment planning system with a nearest neighbor seed sorting routine and AAPM TG43 formalism. Prostate volume, geometric source distribution spread (rcom), dose volume histogram (DVH), and tumor control probability (TCP) calculations were performed from both image sets. Differences in source localization were evaluated by comparing source spread and prescription isodose volumes. Differences in dosimetric analysis were evaluated through prostate-specific DVH and TCP comparisons. Prostate volume as determined from MRI was larger than that of CT by an average of +9.1% (R = 0.70). Calculated rcom was smaller by an average of ?0.9 mm (R = 0.81) . Isodose volumes at 80, 90, 100, and 150% of the prescription dose differed by an average of +2.5, +2.9, ?2.9, and +4.8%, respectively (R = 0.97, 0.98, 0.98, and 0.91). Percentage volume of the prostate encompassed by 80, 100, and 150% of the prescription dose differed by an average of ?0.9, ?0.9, and ?0.1%, respectively (R = 0.34, 0.35, and 0.35). TCP differed by an average of ?0.8% (R = 0.37). The results of this study further support our initial findings that MRI may be used to reliably localize the implanted sources for TIPPB. This study also demonstrated that MRI-based post-implant dosimetric analysis is possible. However, it is evident that differences in prostate localization from MRI to CT can result in significantly different assessments of prostate volume coverage. There is clearly a need to further quantify the differences between these two imaging modalities in this application and address whether greater accuracy in describing the dose-volume relationship based on improvements in visualization of the prostate gland from MRI will translate into improved correlation with treatment outcome.

AB  - Abstract We describe a previously unreported association of ankylosing spondylitis with synovial chondromatosis, and briefly review previously reported cases and treatment of synovial chondromatosis in patients with other immune-mediated inflammatory arthritides. A 20-year-old man with ankylosing spondylitis whose axial disease was in remission with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oral disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs developed recurrent right knee pain and swelling. Magnetic resonance imaging of his right knee revealed calcified loose bodies, suggestive of synovial chondromatosis. While waiting for the surgical intervention and other invasive therapy previously reported in patients with synovial chondromatosis, a trial of etanercept eliminated the pain and swelling of the knee; however, the loose bodies have persisted during the 2-year follow-up. Thus, synovial chondromatosis should be considered in the differential diagnoses of a refractory monoarticular pain and swelling in patients with otherwise controlled inflammatory arthritis. Our report advocates a trial of anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs, which might delay the need for invasive therapy in patients with synovial chondromatosis.

AB  - Objective To provide an up-to-date summary of current literature on the management of adverse effects of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Patients and Methods All relevant medical literature on men with prostate cancer treated with ADT from 2005 to 2014, and older relevant papers, were reviewed. Recent health advisory statements from the Australian government, societies and advocacy groups have been incorporated to the document. Results There are numerous adverse effects of ADT that require pro-active prevention and treatment. Ranging from cardiovascular disease, diabetes and osteoporosis, to depression, cognitive decline and sexual dysfunction, the range of adverse effects is wide. Baseline assessment, monitoring, prevention and consultation from a multidisciplinary team are important in minimising the harm from ADT. Conclusions This review provides a series of practical recommendations to assist with managing the adverse effects of ADT.

AB  - Summary Anorectal disorders, such as faecal incontinence, defecation difficulty and conditions associated with anorectal pain, are commonly encountered in the practices of gastroenterologists, urogynaecologists and colorectal surgeons. The evaluation of these disorders has been very much improved by the development and wider availability of diagnostic tests, such as manometry, endo-anal ultrasound, static and dynamic pelvic magnetic resonance imaging and electromyography. After briefly reviewing the normal anatomy and physiology of the anorectum, the pathophysiology and diagnostic approaches to faecal incontinence, defecation disorders and functional anorectal pain are discussed. Until recently, the management of these disorders has been largely anecdotal. However, our therapeutic armamentarium has been expanded by pharmacological agents, such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers and botulinum toxin, as well as the development of novel techniques, such as sacral nerve stimulation. These and other pharmacological, behavioural and surgical approaches are reviewed with respect to the robustness of evidence to support their efficacy in patients with these disorders.

AB  - Abstract Background Reducing the incidence of indwelling urinary catheter (IUC) use and early removal of the devices that are inserted are appropriate priorities for quality patient care. Just like symptomatic bacteriuria, failed catheter removal as a complication of IUC use is associated with considerable morbidity. In the ideal setting, patients who need IUCs have them, and patients who do not need them will have them removed safely, with the goal of reducing medical complications and facilitating the rehabilitation phase of care. Objective To determine the incidence of failed removal of IUCs and the factors associated with failed removal in persons hospitalized with acute stroke. Design Retrospective review of medical records and associated clinical data collection platforms. Setting Comprehensive stroke center at a tertiary care hospital. Patients The study cohort included 175 stroke patients admitted to the hospital and managed with IUCs. Mean age was 66.1 years (standard deviation = 15), 55% were female. Methods Univariable and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. Variables assessed included age, gender, race, duration of hospital stay, stroke subtype, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and 6-Clicks Scale, which is a measure of functional status. Main Outcome Measurements The dependent variable was occurrence of a failed attempt at removal of an IUC, defined as removal followed by a catheter reinsertion. Results During the study period, 175 of 432 patients with acute hospital admission for new stroke had an IUC removal event. Of these patients, 46 (26%) experienced a failed catheter removal. On univariate analysis, factors significantly associated with failed removal included presence of a hemorrhagic stroke (P = .005), lower level of physical function (by 6-Clicks and NIHSS scores), hospital length of stay (P < .001), and discharge location (P = .005). Bedside bladder ultrasound testing by nursing staff was used more frequently in the group of patients who had unsuccessful IUC removals (95% confidence interval 4.56-21.67, P < .001). Length of stay (P < .001), white race (P = .001), and hemorrhagic stroke (P = .009) were associated independently with failed catheter removal after adjustment for other clinical variables. Conclusions This single-site study identified a high incidence of failed urinary catheter removal in patients with stroke, along with factors associated with failed removal. This is the first step in developing a predictive model that could reduce the incidence of this adverse event. Policies, penalties, and protocols designed to reduce catheter days must be sensitive to the special situations in which IUCs are medically necessary and equal consideration given to identifying the patients for which catheter removal poses a greater risk than continued catheter use.

AB  - Objective To report the surgical technique and outcome of dogs undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy for removal of unilateral noninvasive pheochromocytoma. Study Design Retrospective case series. Animals Dogs with unilateral noninvasive adrenal tumors (n=10). Methods Medical records of dogs that underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy for histologically confirmed pheochromocytoma were reviewed. Dogs were positioned in lateral recumbency with the table tilted up to create a semi-sternal position. Three or 4 ports were used and dissection of the mass proceeded using a combination of laparoscopic instrumentation, bipolar vessel-sealing devices, and in some cases monopolar electrosurgical probes. Conversion rate, complications, surgical time, hospitalization time, and long-term follow-up were recorded. Results The procedure was completed without the need for conversion in 9 of 10 dogs. In 1 dog, hemorrhage obscured the visual field and conversion to an open approach was elected. In 5 cases, a 3-port approach was used, and in 5 cases, a 4th port was placed. Median surgical time was 105 minutes (range, 65?250). Intraoperative complications included 1 splenic laceration. Postoperatively, 1 dog developed gastric dilatation-volvulus. All dogs were discharged from the hospital. Median follow-up time was 16.0 months (range, 6.9?38.0). Conclusion With careful case selection, laparoscopic adrenalectomy for resection of pheochromocytoma was feasible and could be performed efficiently by experienced laparoscopic surgeons.

AB  - Summary In the United Kingdom, when a patient complains that he/she has impaired vision, the first port of call is frequently an optometrist and if spectacles are not the answer a further referral is made to a hospital through the general practitioner. Unilateral visual field defects that present in this way are commonly caused by focal retinal pathology, congenital optic nerve defects, glaucoma, optic disc drusen, previous trauma, compressive lesions and as chronic sequelae of subclinical branch retinal artery and vein occlusions or demyelinating optic neuritis. The diagnostic problem of progressive bilateral visual loss is usually solvable with a clear understanding of the knowledge of the visual pathways, patterns of visual symptoms and careful examination. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) permits non-cross-sectional imaging of internal structures in biological tissues using near infra-red light.

AB  - Summary Endocrine causes of hypertensive emergencies are easily overlooked when patients present with uncontrolled hypertension in association with evidence of end-organ damage. Emergencies arising from hypertensive crises due to pheochromocytoma can be particularly dangerous. To ensure appropriate therapeutic counter-measures and a favorable outcome, the presence of a catecholamine-producing tumor should be distinguished from more common etiologies as well as other uncommon endocrine causes, such as primary hyperaldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, and thyrotoxicosis. However, diagnosis at the time of the emergency can be made difficult by activation of the sympathoadrenal system resulting from the physiological stress of the clinical condition. Tests of catecholamine excess are therefore rendered problematic to interpret, with reliable diagnosis often only possible once and if the patient recovers. Because of this and time delays in obtaining test results, recognition of a possible endocrine cause in the emergency setting requires careful attention to patient history, presentation, and precipitating causes that may provide clues to underlying etiologies to guide therapeutic interventions.
