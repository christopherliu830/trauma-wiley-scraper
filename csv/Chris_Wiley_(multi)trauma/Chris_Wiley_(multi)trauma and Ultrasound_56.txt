AB  - Summary In the United Kingdom, when a patient complains that he/she has impaired vision, the first port of call is frequently an optometrist and if spectacles are not the answer a further referral is made to a hospital through the general practitioner. Unilateral visual field defects that present in this way are commonly caused by focal retinal pathology, congenital optic nerve defects, glaucoma, optic disc drusen, previous trauma, compressive lesions and as chronic sequelae of subclinical branch retinal artery and vein occlusions or demyelinating optic neuritis. The diagnostic problem of progressive bilateral visual loss is usually solvable with a clear understanding of the knowledge of the visual pathways, patterns of visual symptoms and careful examination. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) permits non-cross-sectional imaging of internal structures in biological tissues using near infra-red light. Optic nerve lesions generally lead to monocular visual loss and pain is a frequent accompanying features.

AB  - Introduction: Mitral valve disease (MVD) is the most common acquired heart disease in dogs. When it results in congestive heart failure (CHF), MVD becomes an important cause of morbidity and mortality in dogs. Markers for determining the severity of cardiac injury and the heart's response to therapy might provide valuable information regarding the overall prognosis early in the course of CHF. This information might also provide a means for identifying those dogs with MVD that are at risk for CHF and those that might benefit from specific therapeutic interventions. In this study, we propose to investigate markers of cardiac myocyte injury in dogs that present in advanced (or Class IV) CHF due to MVD. Cardiac troponin I (CTnI) and cardiac troponin T (CTnT) are markers specific for cardiac myocyte damage, and serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP and pro-BNP), for myocyte stretch. These markers have shown predictive value in human and veterinary medicine, however further investigation is required. It is our hypothesis that one or more of these markers will be elevated at presentation compared to established laboratory normal values. Methods: Fifteen dogs that presented with Class IV CHF due to MVD based on physical examination findings, thoracic radiographs, and cardiac ultrasound had a blood sample drawn to measure serum levels of CTnT, CTnI and BNP, and pro-BNP at a commercial laboratory using immunoassays. Results: Our results show that 1 of 15 dogs had an elevated CTnT, 6 had an elevated CTnI, 0 had an elevated pro-BNP, and 3 had and elevated BNP level above laboratory normal values. Conclusions: There was no consistent elevation of CTnI, CTnT, BNP or pro-BNP in dogs with class IV CHF due to MR at time of presentation. Further studies need to be performed to evaluate these makers in dogs with CHF due to MR at varying intervals after admission to determine their potential benefits as markers of cardiac injury and response to therapy.

AB  - Summary In the hemophilias or other congenital clotting deficiencies, either acute or chronic hemorrhage in vulnerable anatomic locations can produce a hematologic emergency. In virtually every instance, replacement of the relevant missing clotting factor or cells (platelets) should follow immediately critical initial cardiovascular or respiratory resuscitation measures. A history of recent trauma should increase the hematologists' index of suspicion but the absence of such a history should not eliminate the possibility of injury-induced bleeding in these populations. Surgical management may need to follow resuscitation and factor replacement if organ compromise cannot be prevented by these initial therapeutic interventions. In the latter circumstances, clotting factor replacement strategies will likely need to be continued until homeostasis is achieved and requisite healing is well underway. Occult hemorrhage that progresses may produce emergent circumstances particularly in the central nervous system and nearby to the airway. Therefore, mainstays of emergent management for inherited bleeding disorders include a cautious expectancy that the status quo may not assure adequate management and vigilance that bleeding may return insidiously.

AB  - Summary Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in around10-20%of patients admitted to hospital, and is most often due to hypovolaemia/hypotension, sepsis and nephrotoxins. This chapter summarizes stage-based management of AKI. It also summarizes monitoring and supportive care in AKI. Three common scenarios are encountered: corrected hypovolaemia/hypotension, with improving renal function; persisting/worsening AKI despite correction of hypovolaemia/hypotension and removal of nephrotoxins; and suspected urinary tract obstruction. Prompt and vigorous correction of hypovolaemia and hypotension will often reverse AKI. If there is clinically obvious hypovolaemia, IV fluid is given. Treatment of the trigger of deterioration and avoidance of hypovolaemia (preferably by albumin administration) can help to decrease the incidence of AKI. A CVP line may be helpful (to avoid over-replacement of fluid), but the patient should be resuscitated first before this is placed. Ultrasonography of the inferior vena cava is one of the methods to assess the CVP.

AB  - Abstract The close proximity of pelvic organs makes the genitourinary system susceptible to injury during major pelvic surgery. Iatrogenic injury remains the most common cause of lower urinary tract trauma. Recent modifications in surgical technique, such as sharp mesorectal incision and nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, have decreased the incidence of many of these complications. Genitourinary complications due to pelvic surgery remain common, however, and as new surgical advancements are made, new complications may present. An understanding of the prevention, recognition, and treatment of urologic complications is important for every surgeon performing major pelvic surgery. Semin. Surg.

AB  - Objectives To identify the incidence, risk factors and presenting signs of lymphoma in dogs presenting to primary-care practice in the UK using analysis of data within the VetCompass? programme. Materials and Methods Case records from the VetCompass? programme from primary-care practices in the UK were searched for newly diagnosed lymphoma in dogs within a 1-year period: 2013. Diagnosis was based on clinical records with or without laboratory confirmation. Signalment was evaluated as risk factors for lymphoma diagnosis using multivariable logistic regression. Results There were 286 presumed newly diagnosed cases identified during 2013 from 455,553 dogs (overall incidence risk 63 of 100,000 dogs per year) of which 193 (67%) were laboratory confirmed (42 of 100,000 dogs per year). Advanced age, dogs older than 12?years, dogs weighing more than 30?kg and some specific breeds were significantly associated with lymphoma diagnosis. Only 18 dogs (6%) of the population identified were referred to a specialist clinic. Clinical Significance This study concurs with others that age, bodyweight and breed are significant risk factors for lymphoma. Results of this study highlight: (1) the low number of dogs with lymphoma that are referred to specialists in the UK and (2) that few dogs undergo immunophenotyping (which can carry prognostic importance), emphasising the importance of epidemiological programmes that evaluate diseases presented to primary-care veterinarians.

AB  - Objectives To report the signalment, clinical presentation, treatments pursued and outcomes of dogs with malignant anal sac melanoma. Methods Medical records from five institutions from January 2000 through December 2015 were reviewed and dogs with cytologically- or histologically-confirmed malignant anal sac melanoma were identified. Signalment, clinical signs, staging, cytology, histopathologic analysis, surgical and non-surgical treatments were extracted from the medical records. The referring veterinarians and owners were contacted for follow-up data. Results Eleven dogs were included and survival data was available for all. The most common clinical signs were bloody anal sac discharge and perianal licking. Initial treatments pursued included surgery (n=8), chemotherapy (n=1), and palliative treatment with pain medications and stool softeners (n=2). In an adjuvant setting, melanoma vaccine was pursued following surgery in three dogs and chemotherapy in one dog. Regardless of treatment, progression-free survival (mean 92 · 5?days) and overall survival times (median 107?days) were short. Clinical Significance Dogs in this case series had a guarded to poor prognosis regardless of treatment. Ten of 11 dogs were euthanased due to local or distant disease progression. Only 1 of 11 dogs was alive one year after diagnosis. An understanding of tumour behaviour in this location could lead to improved survival times with earlier diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Summary.? A conservative, non-operative physiotherapeutic regime for the management of chronic haematomata and pseudotumours in patients suffering from haemophilia is described in this article. Two cases are described where physiotherapy treatment is applied to large masses at the shoulder and femur respectively, where therapy commenced within the first 6?months following onset. These are presented relative to a case that was managed over a much longer period without early physiotherapy input, and the relative outcomes are examined. While both the early physiotherapy-managed cases showed a complete resolution at follow-up examination, the more established chronic pseudotumour required surgical excision, with significant residual muscle contractility, length and strength issues noted on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging reviews. No adverse symptoms or haemostatic issues were reported in response to this less invasive treatment regime by either patient in the two conservative physiotherapy cases.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Ocular diseases in horses often require long-lasting and costly therapies. Without proper treatment they may lead to partial or full blindness, excluding horses from intended use, and thus pose a serious veterinary and economic problem. Objectives No epidemiological data on equine ocular pathologies in Poland was available. The aim of this study was to evaluate their type and prevalence in pure-bred Arabian horses. Study design The study involved 615 horses (15% of Arabian population) bred and owned by 3 Arabian state stud farms in Poland. All horses underwent standard clinical and ophthalmic examination and medical history from the previous 5 years was analysed. Methods The medical history was based on the data from farms? veterinary archives in the stables and epidemiological interview given by the resident veterinarian. Every horse underwent general clinical and ophthalmic examination. Results The prevalence of ocular diseases was 9.8% (95% CI: 7.7?12.4%). The following pathologies were diagnosed: equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) ? prevalence of 5.5% (95% CI: 4.0?7.6%), non-ERU related cataract ? 3.3% (95% CI: 1.9?4.7%), post traumatic lesions ? 0.8% (95% CI: 0.4?1.9%), glaucoma ? one case. Seven horses had one nonvisual eye, one was bilaterally blind. Conclusions Equine recurrent uveitis was the most common ocular disease in this Polish population of Arabian horses. Its prevalence is lower than usually reported in Europe (8?10%) and in the United States (8?25%). However, severe ocular pathologies were observed confirming that they remain an important clinical problem. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study was not stated. Sources of funding:?The research was supported by a grant from National Science Centre on the basis of the decision No DEC-2011/03/B/NZ6/04682. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Summary Vascular anomalies encompass a broad spectrum of tumours and malformations as classified by the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies. Despite being one of the most common congenital abnormalities, they are often misunderstood in clinical practice: use of the term ?haemangioma? to denote any vascular anomaly still occurs. They are found frequently in the head and neck, often as complex lesions that require multidisciplinary management which necessitates an accurate diagnosis. Precise radiological assessment is therefore crucial. This pictorial review will briefly discuss the current classification system of vascular anomalies and the optimal radiological tools for their evaluation.

AB  - Purpose To establish a new imaging technique using dynamic MRI three-dimensional (3D) volumetric acquisition in real-time, on six normal shoulders for the analysis of the 3D shoulder kinematics during continuous motion. Materials and Methods At first, a standard static acquisition was performed. Then, fast images were obtained with a multi-slice 3D balanced gradient echo sequence to get a real time series during the initial phase of shoulder abduction. Subsequently, the images were reconstructed; registered and the translational patterns of the humeral head relative to the glenoid and the size of the subacromial space were calculated. Additionally, the intraobserver reproducibility was tested. Results The maximal abduction was on average 43° (30° to 60°) and the mean width of the subacromial space was 7.7 mm (SD:?±?1.2 mm). Difference between extreme values and average values was low, respectively 2.5 mm on X-axis, 2 mm on Y-axis, 1.4 mm for the width of the subacromial space and 1.2° for the measure of the glenohumeral abduction. Conclusion This study reported a dynamic MRI protocol for the monitoring of shoulder 3D kinematics during continuous movement. The results suggest that there is no superior shift of the humeral head during the first phase of abduction. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2014;39:729?734. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This chapter focuses on a few of the basic natural products used in wound care, including, honey, sugar, yeast extract, and aloe vera. Large areas of necrotic tissue are best surgically debrided prior to application of honey and sugar. Leeches have been used in an attempt to manage hemodynamic imbalance or venous insufficiency in compromised skin. In an attempt to reduce venous stasis, leeches were applied to the tail wound daily over a 4-day period. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been described for medical uses. The medical uses include orthopedics, sports medicine, dentistry, otolaryngology, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, urogenital surgery, burns and wound healing, cardiothoracic surgery, and maxillofacial surgery. The primary clinical application of PRP is to promote wound healing by increasing the local concentration of growth factors involved in the migration, proliferation, and maturation at the site of injury.
