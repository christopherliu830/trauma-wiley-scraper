AB  - Abstract Objective Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are considered atheroprotective, and low levels have been associated with the acute coronary syndrome (ACS), particularly non-ST elevation (NSTE)-ACS. However, the functional properties as well as homeostasis of Tregs are mainly unknown in coronary artery disease (CAD). Here, we investigated the composition and functional properties of naïve (n) and memory (m)Tregs in patients with NSTE-ACS and in patients 6?12 months post-ACS. Methods Based on the expression of CD25, FOXP3, CD127, CD45RA, CD39 and CTLA-4, Treg subsets were defined by flow cytometry in whole blood or isolated CD4+ T cells. The functional properties of nTregs and mTregs were examined in terms of proliferative capacity and modulation of cytokine secretion. To understand the potential consequences of Treg defects, we also investigated correlations with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine secretion and ultrasound-defined carotid atherosclerosis. Results Both NSTE-ACS and post-ACS patients exhibited reduced levels of nTregs (P < 0.001) compared with healthy control subjects, but without compensatory increases in mTregs. Both nTregs and mTregs from patients showed significantly lower replicative rates and impaired capacity to modulate T-cell proliferation and secretion of interferon-gamma and IL-10. The Treg defect was also associated with LPS-induced cytokine secretion and increased burden of carotid atherosclerosis. Conclusion Our results demonstrate a functional and homeostatic Treg defect in patients with NSTE-ACS and also in stabilized patients 6?12 months after ACS. Moreover, this defect was associated with a subclinical proinflammatory and atherogenic state. We believe that the failure to preserve Treg function and homeostasis reflects a need for immune-restoring strategies in CAD.

AB  - Summary A 4-week-old Thoroughbred filly foal with a history of sepsis was evaluated for right hindlimb lameness. Bilateral femoropatellar and femorotibial joint effusions were detected. Ultrasonography and radiography of the right stifle revealed signs of joint collapse and periarticular swelling. Computed tomography revealed abnormalities in the bone density of the medial femoral condyle of the right hindlimb and lateral femoral condyle of the left hindlimb. Euthanasia was recommended based on the severity of the lesions. Gross and microscopic examinations revealed extensive separation of the articular-epiphyseal cartilage complex from the subchondral bone of the femoral condyles. The histological features suggest an ischaemic aetiology; comparisons are made with lesions of osteochondrosis and avascular necrosis of bone.

AB  - Abstract Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an acute gastrointestinal disorder that is the most common and requiring emergency hospitalization. Its incidence is increasing worldwide, thus increasing the burden of medical services. Approximately 20% of the patients develop moderate to severe necrotizing pancreatitis associated with pancreatic or peri-pancreatic tissue necrosis and multiple organ failure. There are many reports about the anti-inflammatory effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on pancreatitis and the repair of tissue damage. MSCs cells come from a wide range of sources, autologous MSCs come from bone marrow and allogeneic MSCs such as umbilical cord blood MSCs, placenta-derived MSCs, etc. The wide source is not only an advantage of MSCs but also a disadvantage of MSCs. Because of different cell sources and different methods of collection and preparation, it is impossible to establish a unified standard method for evaluation of efficacy. The biggest advantage of iMSCs is that it can be prepared by a standardized process, and can be prepared on a large scale, which makes it easier to commercialize. This paper reviews the present status of diagnosis and progress of MSCs therapy for AP.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: Single-port laparoscopic surgery usually uses the transumbilical approach. However, the transumbilical incision may be associated with a high frequency of wound-related complications, including trocar site hernia and infection. Therefore, we developed remote access laparoscopic (REAL) surgery, a new access technique for single-port surgery within the pubic hairline. This study reports on a technique developed at our institution and describes our preliminary results. Materials and Surgical Technique: Ten patients with cholecystolithiasis underwent REAL surgery. A single 2.5-cm transverse incision was made medially within the pubic hairline area, and a SILS Port was inserted. A 5-mm flexible endoscope and an articulating grasper or a long laparoscopic grasper were used. Dissection of the gallbladder was achieved with laparoscopic ultrasonic shears just as in the conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy. All procedures were successfully performed without conversion to conventional laparoscopic technique. There were no postoperative complications, and outpatient evaluation showed a clean scar within the pubic hair area in all patients. Discussion: Our early experience shows that REAL surgery is feasible and safe. This novel access technique can preserve the native umbilicus and provides an invisible scar that is concealed within the pubic hair.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The objective was to critically appraise and highlight medical education research published in 2012 that was methodologically superior and whose outcomes were pertinent to teaching and education in emergency medicine (EM). Methods A search of the English language literature in 2012 querying Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), PsychInfo, PubMed, and Scopus identified EM studies using hypothesis-testing or observational investigations of educational interventions. Two reviewers independently screened all of the publications and removed articles using established exclusion criteria. This year, publications limited to a single-site survey design that measured satisfaction or self-assessment on unvalidated instruments were not formally reviewed. Six reviewers then independently ranked all remaining publications using one of two scoring systems depending on whether the study methodology was primarily qualitative or quantitative. Each scoring system had nine criteria, including four related to methodology, that were chosen a priori, to standardize evaluation by reviewers. The quantitative study scoring system was used previously to appraise medical education published annually in 2008 through 2011, while a separate, new qualitative study scoring system was derived and implemented consisting of parallel metrics. Results Forty-eight medical education research papers met the a priori criteria for inclusion, and 33 (30 quantitative and three qualitative studies) were reviewed. Seven quantitative and two qualitative studies met the criteria for inclusion as exemplary and are summarized in this article. Conclusions This critical appraisal series aims to promote superior education research by reviewing and highlighting nine of the 48 major education research studies with relevance to EM published in 2012. Current trends and common methodologic pitfalls in the 2012 papers are noted.

AB  - Summary In prostate cancer, bone metastasis is related to a poor prognosis and is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality. Detection of metastatic bone disease is particularly important in prostate cancer patients with high probability for distant metastases before embarking on radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy. The choice of imaging modalities that best depict the metastatic bony lesions may vary depending on different patterns of bone metastases. Bone scintigraphy has been used routinely in the evaluation of prostate cancer patients in the last decades. However, it suffers from adequate specificity. Single photon emission tomography (SPECT) increases the sensitivity and specificity of planar bone scanning especially for the evaluation of the spine. Recently, positron emission tomography (PET) using F-18 Fluoride shows promising results in the detection of bone metastases especially in cancers with prominent osteoblasic pattern of bone metastases such as prostate cancer. This article reviews the value of conventional planar bone scanning, SPECT, SPECT/CT as well as F-18 Fluoride PET/CT in the assessment of bone metastases in prostate cancer patients.

AB  - Summary A 15-year-old Boerperd stallion presented for thyroid enlargement associated with inappetance. Ultrasonographic examination of the thyroid gland revealed an enlarged left lobe, which, on cytological examination, contained numerous anaplastic cells. A mixed C cell microfollicular thyroid carcinoma was diagnosed following histopathological examination of the excisional biopsy specimen. In order to determine metastasis, pulmonary radiographs revealed a poorly-marginated soft tissue opacity caudo-dorsal to the cardiac silhouette. Thyroid and pulmonary scintigraphy was performed comparing 99mTc-sestamibi with 99mTc-pertechnetate and no metastasis was detectable. Following hemithyroidectomy, the stallion made a full recovery without the need for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Six months later, repeated thyroid and pulmonary scintigraphy using 99mTc-sestamibi was normal.

AB  - Summary.? Experience of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa, NovoSeven?; Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) to control haemorrhage in non-haemophilic children is limited. The object of this study was to examine the applicability and safety of rFVIIa amongst a group of non-haemophilic paediatric subjects. Details of all non-haemophilic children ≤16?years receiving rFVIIa whose data were recorded in the investigational, internet-based registry, haemostasis.com were analysed. A total of 265 children (mean age 7.7?years) were treated with rFVIIa; the median dose administered was 78.4??g?kg?1 body weight (range 9.0?393.4) and the median total dose received 100.0??g?kg?1 body weight (range 10.9?1341.2). Therapeutic areas included surgery (34.5%), coagulopathy (including thrombocytopenia; 29.0%), spontaneous bleeding (17.2%), trauma (8.4%) and intracranial haemorrhage (4.5%). Two patients experienced thromboembolic events following administration of rFVIIa. Thirty-nine patients died on account of haemorrhage or complications relating to their underlying condition; neither the thromboembolic events nor the deaths were related to rFVIIa administration. Bleeding stopped in 118/237 (49.8%), markedly decreased in 54/237 (22.8%), decreased in 51/237 (21.5%), remained unchanged in 13/237 (5.5%) and increased in 1/237 (0.4%) patients. These results suggest that rFVIIa is safe and widely applicable in children to control non-haemophilic haemorrhage.

AB  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE 2011; 18:1081?1089 ? 2011 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine Abstract Objectives:? The objective was to critically appraise and highlight medical education research studies published in 2010 that were methodologically superior and whose outcomes were pertinent to teaching and education in emergency medicine (EM). Methods:? A search of the English language literature in 2010 querying PubMed, Scopus, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), and PsychInfo identified 41 EM studies that used hypothesis-testing or observational investigations of educational interventions. Five reviewers independently ranked all publications based on 10 criteria, including four related to methodology, that were chosen a priori to standardize evaluation by reviewers. This method was used previously to appraise medical education published in 2008 and 2009. Results:? Five medical education research studies met the a priori criteria for inclusion and are reviewed and summarized here. Comparing the literature of 2010 to 2008 and 2009, the number of published educational research papers increased from 30 to 36 and then to 41. The number of funded studies remained fairly stable over the past 3?years at 13 (2008), 16 (2009), and 9 (2010). As in past?years, research involving the use of technology accounted for a significant number of publications (34%), including three of the five highlighted studies. Conclusions:? Forty-one EM educational studies published in 2010 were identified. This critical appraisal reviews and highlights five studies that met a priori quality indicators. Current trends and common methodologic pitfalls in the 2010 papers are noted.

AB  - Purpose:?? Perineal and posterior vaginal wall reconstruction following abdominoperineal and local cancer resection requires replacement of dead space and restoration of function. Ideal reconstructive options include those which avoid muscle sacrifice, do not interfere with colostomy formation, and avoid the use of irradiated tissue. Methodology:?? We present our experience with a new technique for perineal and vaginal reconstruction: superior and inferior gluteal artery perforator (SGAP or IGAP) flaps. We describe the operative technique and outcome in 14 consecutive patients. Six cases were performed as primary reconstruction and 8 cases were delayed, with all receiving preoperative radiotherapy. Results:?? Immediate reconstructions underwent preoperative imaging with ultrasound only, while delayed reconstructions underwent preoperative CTA. Postoperatively, patients were ambulated immediately, with all bed rest and sitting performed on the contralateral buttock or side for 4?weeks. There were no flap failures or partial flap losses, and no postoperative hernias. Four patients developed early minor wound dehiscence that was resutured in three cases. Revisional surgery was performed for reduction of three bulky flaps. All female patients reported resumption of sexual intercourse following this procedure. Conclusion:?? Gluteal artery perforator flaps are good options for perineal reconstruction, avoiding the donor site morbidity associated with rectus abdominis or gluteus maximus muscle harvest.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the airway and perioperative management. Beta Blockers have potential beneficial effects when taken perioperatively. In addition to helping prevent/control arrhythmias, beta blockade also helps reduce myocardial oxygen demand that is produced by catecholamine release during stress periods. The most widely accepted theory of the continuation of statin therapy in the perioperative period is due to plaque stabilization. This is thought to occur secondary to the reduction of thrombin-induced expression and lipopolysaccharide induced expression of tissue factor. Assessment for difficult cricothyrotomy can be performed by patient history and physical examination. The mnemonic ?SMART? is a tool that can used to assess for difficulties that may occur: S: Surgery; M: Mass; A: Access or Anatomy; R: Radiation; and T: Tumor. Clinicians should be aware of identifiable factors in patients with difficult airways as these can dictate outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Positive peritoneal cytology equates M1 disease in patients with gastric cancer. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) is a proven test to detect occult visceral injury in trauma patients. The objective of this study is to determine whether DPL can be used to assess peritoneal cytology in patients with gastric cancer. Methods Patients with gastric adenocarcinoma were prospectively enrolled to undergo DPL prior to diagnostic laparoscopy (DL). Saline was instilled through a percutaneous catheter and fluid was collected for cytology (DPL-cyt). Washings obtained during DL were used as controls (DL-cyt). Results DPL was successful in 22/27 patients (81.5%). Among the 22 successful DPLs, 12 had positive cytology (54.5%). Positive DPL-cyt specimens matched DL-cyt specimens in 12/12 cases (specificity?=?100%). One of 10 cases with negative DPL-cyt was positive on the final DL-cyt (sensitivity?=?92%). There were six patients with negative DPL-cyt who had visible M1 disease diagnosed with DL (DPL evaluation of M1 disease, sensitivity 54.5%, specificity?=?100%). Conclusions DPL is a safe method of detecting positive cytology in patients with gastric cancer, however gross M1 disease may be missed without visual inspection. The specific role of DPL in the staging workup of patients with gastric cancer remains to be determined. J. Surg. Oncol. 2013;107:794?798. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Background The control of sepsis is the primary goal of surgical intervention in patients with infected necrosis. Simple surgical approaches that are easy to reproduce may improve outcomes when specialists in endoscopy are not available. The aim of the present study was to describe the experience with a focused open necrosectomy (FON) in patients with infected necrosis. Method A prospective pilot study conducted to compare a semi-open/closed drainage laparotomy and FON with the assistance of peri-operative ultrasound. The incidence of sepsis, dynamics of C-reactive protein (CRP), intensive care unit (ICU)/hospital stay, complication rate and mortality were compared and analysed. Results From a total of 58 patients, 36 patients underwent a conventional open necrosectomy and 22 patients underwent FON. The latter method resulted in a faster resolution of sepsis and a significant decrease in mean CRP on Day 3 after FON, P = 0.001. Post-operative bleeding was in 1 versus 7 patients and the incidence of intestinal and pancreatic fistula was 2 versus 8 patients when comparing FON to the conventional approach. The median ICU stay was 11.6 versus 23 days and the hospital stay was significantly shorter, 57 versus 72 days, P = 0.024 when comparing FON versus the conventional group. One patient died in the FON group and seven patients died in the laparotomy group, P = 0.139. Discussion FON can be an alternative method to conventional open necrosectomy in patients with infected necrosis and unresolved sepsis.

AB  - Abstract Objective The objective of this study was to investigate the safety and feasibility of treating infrapopliteal lesions using a novel drug delivery catheter locally delivering liquid paclitaxel. Background Balloon angioplasty is currently the Gold Standard to treat below-the-knee disease; however, restenosis continues to be a great challenge following these percutaneous revascularization procedures. Methods The Occlusion Perfusion Catheter for Optimal Delivery of Paclitaxel for the Prevention of Endovascular Restenosis (COPPER-A) study?Below-the-Knee Cohort was a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter, feasibility, and safety study that enrolled 35 patients at 11 participating sites. The safety endpoints at 1, 3, and 6 months were freedom from thrombosis, major amputation in the target limb and target limb related death. The efficacy endpoints were primary patency and freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization at 6 months. Results All patients tolerated the procedure well with no reports of adverse procedural events. Thirty-five patients were treated with a mean lesion length of 112?±?81.2?mm with the lesion length range of 20?286?mm. At 6-month follow-up, primary patency was 89.3% and freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization was 96.4%. No patients demonstrated thrombosis, major amputation in the target limb and target limb related death at the 1-, 3- and 6-months follow-up intervals. Conclusions The results of this multi-center study demonstrated that infrapopliteal arteries can be safely and effectively treated with liquid paclitaxel using the occlusion perfusion catheter.

AB  - Abstract Background A growing body of literature supports patient and public involvement in the design, prioritization, and dissemination of research and evidence-based medicine. The objectives of this project were to engage patients and families in developing a prioritized list of research topics for pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) and to compare results with prior research prioritization initiatives in the emergency department (ED) setting. Methods We utilized a systematic process to combine administrative data on frequency of patient presentations to the ED with multiple stakeholder input including an initial stakeholder survey followed by a modified Delphi consensus methodology consisting of two Web-based surveys and a face-to-face meeting. Results The prioritization process resulted in a ranked list of 15 research priorities. The top five priorities were mental health presentations, pain and sedation, practice tools, quality of care delivery, and resource utilization. Mental health, pain and sedation, clinical prediction rules, respiratory illnesses/wheeze, patient safety/medication error, and sepsis were identified as shared priorities with prior initiatives. Topics identified in our process that were not identified in prior work included resource utilization, ED communication, antibiotic stewardship, and patient/family adherence with recommendations. Conclusions This work identifies key priorities for research in PEM. Comparing our results with prior initiatives in the ED setting identified shared research priorities and opportunities for collaboration among PEM research networks. This work in particular makes an important contribution to the existing literature by including the patient/family perspective missing from prior work.
