AB  - Abstract Objective The objectives were to critically appraise the medical education research literature of 2015 and review the highest-quality quantitative and qualitative examples. Methods A total of 434 emergency medicine (EM)-related articles were discovered upon a search of ERIC, PsychINFO, PubMED, and SCOPUS. These were both quantitative and qualitative in nature. All were screened by two of the authors using previously published exclusion criteria, and the remaining were appraised by all authors using a previously published scoring system. The highest scoring articles were then reviewed. Results Sixty-one manuscripts were scored, and 10 quantitative and two qualitative papers were the highest scoring and are reviewed and summarized in this article. Conclusions This installment in this critical appraisal series reviews 12 of the highest-quality EM-related medical education research manuscripts published in 2015.

AB  - Abstract Open distal pancreatic resection has been performed over the years for management of patients with a variety of pancreatic disorders. However, the technique is usually not performed in the same way by all surgeons. In recent years, the laparoscopic approach has been introduced with all the advantages of a minimally invasive procedure. The primary differences between the open and laparoscopic approaches are the method of access, the method of exposure, and the extent of operative trauma. The clinical advantages of the laparoscopic approach are the reduced length hospitalization, the reduction in postoperative pain, absence of wound-related complications and faster recovery.

AB  - Graft survival and function early after hand transplantation is good. It remains unknown, however, whether long-term survival is limited by chronic rejection. We here describe the clinical course and the status 5 years after bilateral hand transplantation with emphasis on immunosuppression (IS), function, morphology and graft vascular changes. Clinical observation, evaluation of hand function, skin biopsies, X-ray, ultrasound, angiography, CT angiography, electrophysiologic studies including compound motor and sensory action potentials (CMAP, CSAP) and somatosensory evoked potentials were performed and results recorded at regular intervals. Following reduction of IS one mild (grade II) rejection episode occurred at 4 years. Subsequently, skin histology remained normal and without signs of chronic rejection. Hand function continuously improved during the first 3 years and remained stable with minor improvement thereafter. CMAP and CSAP progressively increased during the observation period. Latencies of the cortical responses were prolonged but amplitudes were within normal range. Investigation of hand vessels revealed no signs of occlusion but showed revascularization of a primarily occluded right radialis artery. Motor and sensory function improved profoundly between years 1 and 5 after hand transplantation. No signs whatsoever of chronic rejection have been observed.

AB  - Pelvic exsanguination is usually fatal unless the patient is injured in a city or region that has a sophisticated trauma care system. Simple rules need to be considered when defining the care strategy for these patients. Simple rules: ?? Establish at pre-hospital care and delivery system ?? Recognize the ?at risk? patient or injury pattern ?? Rule out and/or account for other major sources of bleeding ?? Control other sources of bleeding, if possible ?? Resuscitate to a ?tolerable? blood pressure ?? Blood product replacement: RBCs, platelets and FFP ?? Provisionally stabilize the pelvis ?? pelvic binder or sheet ?? ipsilateral femoral traction, in some cases ?? Emergent external fixation? ?? Stop arterial bleeding ?? Angiography and selective embolization ?? Exploration and direct pelvic gutter packing ?? Don?t be fooled by a positive FAST from an extra-peritoneal bladder rupture ?? an ex-lap for a retroperitoneal bleed can be fatal ?? To the TICU for continued resuscitation ?? Delayed definitive reconstruction when physiologically stable

AB  - Summary Abdominal pain is common in school-aged children and is rarely organic, but there is a diverse and extensive differential diagnosis. The Rome III criteria set out diagnostic features of the functional bowel disorders. Most cases require screening investigations, and ?reg flags? identify those more likely to have underlying pathology. Management is often multi-disciplinary, especially important when chronic pain is debilitating and responds poorly to drug or dietary intervention.

AB  - Summary Background Irisin is a new adipo-myokine, encoded by the FNDC5 gene. Currently, there is a discussion regarding the relation between thyroid function and irisin concentration. This prospective study assesses the influence of thyrometabolic changes on serum irisin concentration in association with altered muscle metabolism. This is performed on a large cohort of patients affected by severe hypo- or hyperthyroidism, as well as by the expression of the FNDC5 gene in thyroid tissue affected by different pathologies. Methods The study group comprised 119 patients with newly diagnosed severe hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, and a control group of 45 healthy subjects. Body composition, serum irisin concentrations, and thyroid-related hormones, creatine kinase, dystrophin and titin concentrations were evaluated. FNDC5 expression was also analysed in tissue samples from 80 patients with nontoxic multinodular goitre, toxic goitre, Graves? disease and papillary thyroid cancer. Results Irisin concentration was lower in patients with prolonged hypothyroidism. There was a tendency towards lower dystrophin and titin concentrations in patients with hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Restoration of euthyroidism in patients with hypothyroidism resulted in a decreased muscle mass with an increase in irisin concentrations, while the hyperthyroid group showed an increase in fat mass. Statistically significant overexpression of FNDC5 gene was found in patients with toxic goitre as compared to Graves? disease, papillary thyroid cancer and controls. Conclusions The presented data support the theory that irisin concentration changes are associated with prolonged hypothyroidism and might primarily constitute the result of prolonged myopathy. These changes are most likely not related to the expression of the FNDC5 gene in the thyroid gland.

AB  - Purpose? To evaluate children with obstetric brachial plexus palsy treated with botulinum toxin A (Botox)injections to assist with the management of contracted muscles and joints as well as co-contraction. Methods? Since September 2004, 20 children have been treated. The median age at treatment was 2.1 years (range 7 months to 11 years). As experience was gained, the total dose of Botox increased from 4 to 10 units per kg. Results? 12 patients were treated primarily for restriction of passive external rotation at the shoulder at an average age of 24 months (range 7 to 42 months). This group had the most impressive gains which became apparent within a week of injection. There was a high level of parental satisfaction with an improvement in passive range and increased ease of physiotherapy. Six had excellent and 4 had good results. The two patients who had little improvement had clear indications for surgery. Seven (58%) of these 12 patients went on to have a repeat injection , in 2 cases with a higher dose, aiming to achieve further gains. Five patients were treated for co-contraction of the latissimus dorsi and/or teres major were aged 8 months and from 8 to 11 years. They reported minor gains.All five patients who had triceps injections had improved elbow flexion. One patient had an over active biceps injected with minor benefit. Conclusion? It is hoped that persistent physiotherapy assisted by botulinum toxin A injections targeting internal rotators can reduce gleno-humoral joint dysplasia, posterior subluxation and the need for open procedures. Shoulder subluxation identified by ultrasound should be further imaged with CT or MRI and be considered for an open procedure.

AB  - Abstract Aims Knowledge of the distribution of the innervation zones (IZs) of the external anal sphincter (EAS) may be useful for preventing anal sphincter incompetence during vaginal delivery. A method proposed for the automatic estimation of the distribution of IZs of EAS from high-density surface electromyography (EMG) was evaluated for repeatability in continent volunteers. Methods In 13 healthy female subjects (age: 35?±?11 years) surface EMG signals were acquired using an anal probe with three circumferential electrode arrays (of 16 contacts each) at different depths within the anal canal (15?mm distance between the centers of adjacent arrays), during four independent experimental sessions. Three maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) of 10?sec were performed for each session for a total of 12 contractions per subject. Repeatability of the estimation of the distribution of IZ was tested by evaluating the coefficient of multiple correlations (CMC) between the IZ distributions estimated from the signals recorded from each subject. Results A high repeatability (CMC?>?0.8) was found comparing IZ distributions estimated from signals recorded by each array within the same session. A slightly lower value was obtained considering signals recorded during different sessions (CMC?>?0.7), but a higher value (CMC?>?0.8) was obtained after aligning the estimated IZ distributions. The realignment compensates for the operator's error in repositioning the probe in the same position during different sessions. Conclusion This result justifies clinical studies using high-density surface EMG in routine examinations, providing information about IZs of EAS and assessing the possibilities of preventing neuronal trauma during vaginal delivery.

AB  - ABSTRACT BACKGROUND Although there exists a large body of knowledge on the regulation of arterial cerebral hemodynamics, little is known about the cerebral venous outflow (CVO). METHODS In 19 healthy volunteers, the middle cerebral artery and the straight sinus were examined using transcranial Doppler sonography. Arterial and venous mean flow velocities (aFVmean, vFVmean, respectively) were registered continuously while applying lower body positive (LBPP) or negative (LBNP) pressure of 30 mmHg and performing head-down (?20°, HDT) and -up (+30°, HUT) tilt manoeuvres. The arterial blood pressure was registered simultaneously with a noninvasive finger blood pressure monitor. Relative changes in parameters compared to the proceeding no-pressure, no-tilt baseline were used for analysis. RESULTS While aFVmean did not change significantly, vFVmean inc reased during LBPP by 10.5 ± 2.9% and decreased during LBNP by 15.1 ± 3.5% (mean ± standard error of mean [SEM], P < .01). HUT resulted in a decrease in vFVmean by 25.5 ± 3.3% and HDT, in an increase by 7.8 ± 3.2% (P < .01) without alteration in aFVmean. This may imply a decrease of cerebral blood volume (CBV) during LBPP and HDT and an increase during LBNP and HUT. CONCLUSIONS CVO cannot be neglected when studying cerebral hemodynamics because it might affect the CBV.

AB  - With the development of near-infrared (NIR) technology, real-time utility of NIR and its fluorophores has gained vast interest among surgeons of various sub-disciplines. The purpose of this review is to assess and explore the most recent developments in NIR-guided surgery in an upper gastrointestinal (UGI) surgical setting. Queries of PubMed and Medline literature databases was performed for experimental and clinical studies relevant to NIR use in the context of UGI surgery. NIR-guided UGI surgeries have been reported to be valuable in: (1) esophageal anastomosis; (2) sentinel lymph node biopsy in gastric cancer; (3) detection of liver and pancreatic tumors; and (4) detection of extra bile duct and bile duct injuries. Although NIR technology has shown tremendous promise in UGI surgery, its full clinical translation and wider adaptation remains to be seen. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
