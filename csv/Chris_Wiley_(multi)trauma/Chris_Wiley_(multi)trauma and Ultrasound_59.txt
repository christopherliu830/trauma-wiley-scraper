AB  - Objective To identify risk factors for dehiscence in stapled functional end-to-end anastomoses (SFEEA) in dogs. Study Design Retrospective case series. Animals Dogs (n?=?53) requiring an enterectomy. Methods Medical records from a single institution for all dogs undergoing an enterectomy (2001?2012) were reviewed. Surgeries were included when gastrointestinal (GIA) and thoracoabdominal (TA) stapling equipment was used to create a functional end-to-end anastomosis between segments of small intestine or small and large intestine in dogs. Information regarding preoperative, surgical, and postoperative factors was recorded. Results Anastomotic dehiscence was noted in 6 of 53 cases (11%), with a mortality rate of 83%. The only preoperative factor significantly associated with dehiscence was the presence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Surgical factors significantly associated with dehiscence included the presence, duration, and number of intraoperative hypotensive periods, and location of anastomosis, with greater odds of dehiscence in anastomoses involving the large intestine. Conclusion IBD, location of anastomosis, and intraoperative hypotension are risk factors for intestinal anastomotic dehiscence after SFEEA in dogs. Previously suggested risk factors (low serum albumin concentration, preoperative septic peritonitis, and intestinal foreign body) were not confirmed in this study.

AB  - Summary The normal vertebral artery (VA) can be divided into four segments: the V1 or extraosseous segment; the V2 or foraminal segment; the V3 or extraspinal segment; and the V4 or intradural segment. There are various carotid-vertebral and carotid basilar anastomoses which develop from the persistence of primitive arteries arising from dorsal extensions of the early internal carotid artery (ICA). Embolism is the most common cause of vertebrobasilar ischemia, and vertebral artery stenosis is the second most common cause of vertebrobasilar ischemia. Dissection of the vertebral artery occurs most frequently at the level of the second and third cervical vertebrae. Dissection events occur more frequently in patients who may have fibromuscular disease, a family history, and patients with a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Vertebral artery dissection is most frequently related to either spontaneous dissection or external trauma. Most vertebral intervention is now being done with an entirely endovascular approach.

AB  - Summary One of the most common events in equine practice is the presentation of a trauma resulting in skin and soft-tissue wounds. The physiological benefits of utilizing photobiomodulation therapy as part of the treatment plan in the management of these lesions are a relief of pain, a modulation of the inflammatory response, an increase in circulation, and a subsequent acceleration of the healing process. This chapter provides an overview of the physiological and cellular mechanisms involved, the optimum application techniques, dosages, the frequency of treatment, and the integral role of photobiomodulation therapy in the care of these patients.

AB  - Summary We evaluated the effect of adrenaline on human skin microcirculation (nutritive and sub-papillary) and systemic cardiovascular variables after it was added to lidocaine in infraclavicular brachial plexus blocks. Twelve healthy, non-smoking male volunteers were included, each attending two study sessions 2 weeks apart, and they were studied using a crossover design. In both sessions, they received an ultrasound-guided infraclavicular brachial plexus block in the non-dominant arm with 0.4 ml.kg?1 lidocaine, 15 mg.ml?1 with or without adrenaline 5 ?g.ml?1. Microcirculation was assessed by laser Doppler fluxmetry (sub-papillary blood flow), capillary video microscopy (nutritive blood flow) and continuous temperature measurements. Heart rate and arterial pressure were recorded continuously and non-invasively. Median (IQR [range]) sub-papillary blood flow increased substantially 30 min after the brachial plexus block, from 8.5 (4.4?13.5 [2.9?28.2]) to 162.7 (111.0?197.8 [9.5?206.7]) arbitrary units with adrenaline (p = 0.017), and from 6.9 (5.3?28.5 [1.8?42.1] to 133.7 (16.5?216.7 [1.0?445.0] arbitrary units without adrenaline (p = 0.036). Nutritive blood flow (functional capillary density, capillaries.mm?2, measured at the dorsal side of the hand) decreased in the blocked extremity when adrenaline was used as adjuvant, from median (IQR [range]) 45 (36?52 [26?59]) to 38 (29?41 [26?42]), p = 0.028, whereas no significant change occurred without adrenaline. Median finger skin temperature (°C) increased by 44% (data pooled) with no significant differences between the groups. No significant changes were found in the systemic cardiovascular variables with or without adrenaline. We conclude that lidocaine infraclavicular brachial plexus blocks caused an increase in skin sub-papillary blood flow. The addition of adrenaline produced stronger and longer lasting blocks, but decreased the nutritive blood flow.

AB  - Clinical manifestation of overt vascular disease may be preceded for years by endothelial dysfunction. Objective:? This study was undertaken to evaluate endothelial function in ESRD patients and correlation between endothelial function and clinical and biochemical parameters. Methods:? 32 stable ESRD patients (male?:?female?=?16?:?16, average age: 55.2?±?13.0) on hemodialysis were included. A 10-MHz ultrasound transducer was used to image the brachial artery. Brachial artery diameter was measured, and reactive hyperemia was induced by inflation to 250?mmHg for 5?min and then deflation of a pneumatic cuff. After release of the cuff, brachial artery diameter was measured. Results:? In the entire study population and non-diabetic group, the %FMD (% flow-mediated dilatation, % change of brachial artery diameter between before and after cuff inflation) did not show any significant correlation with duration of dialysis, age, hypertension, albumin, CRP, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride. However, the %FMD of diabetic patients was lower than that of non-diabetics. Among the patients with diabetes, the group of patients with FMD of <5.2% showed significant lower serum albumin and significantly higher ln(CRP) levels compared to the group of patients with FMD ≥5.2%. The %FMD showed significant positive correlation with serum albumin level and significant negative correlation with ln(CRP) in diabetic patients. Conclusion:? These findings suggest that endothelial dysfunction, estimated by FMD, was significantly more prominent in diabetic ESRD, especially with low serum albumin and high CRP levels.

AB  - The moisture contents of foods, fluids, and parenteral solutions taken in and of all samples excreted, the water of oxidation of fuel mixtures burned, and the evaporative water loss must be determined in order to obtain a quantitative picture of water balance. Because there is a tendency to retain water after trauma, surgery, or an acute illness, changes in the water compartment of the body may lead to changes in body weight that may be considered erroneously as changes in energy or protein stores. Measurement of water balance, in addition to calorie and nitrogen balance is one of the most accurate means of accounting for these changes in body composition. Fluid and electrolyte therapy and nutritional supplementation can be tailored to meet the patient's specific needs by utilizing this information. Application of these principles to the care of hospitalized patients outside of the research setting will be discussed.

AB  - Summary Equine proliferative enteropathy (EPE) is a disease of foals caused by the obligate intracellular organism Lawsonia intracellularis. This emerging disease affects mainly weanling foals and causes fever, lethargy, peripheral oedema, diarrhoea, colic and weight loss. The diagnosis of EPE may be challenging and relies on the presence of hypoproteinaemia, thickening of segments of the small intestinal wall observed upon abdominal ultrasonography, positive serology and molecular detection of L.?intracellularis in faeces. Although the clinical entity, diagnostic approach and treatment of EPE are well established and described, the epidemiology for this disease has remained largely unaddressed. This article focuses on new developments in the field of EPE, including epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical signs, diagnosis, treatment and prevention. The Summary is available in Chinese ? see Supporting information.

AB  - Purpose: A semiautomatic method for the assessment of ligament length variations during different joint positions based on MRI data is proposed. Methods: Ligament lengths are represented as distances between points marking characteristic locations in the ligament insertion regions on the bones. These points are defined manually for one single reference joint position and for all other joint positions they are automatically mapped with high accuracy to the correct locations using image registration methods. The methodology is validated using data from 16 volunteers depicting the coracoclavicular ligaments in the left shoulder during different arm abductions. Results: The method yielded a superior reproducibility of the point locations over different joint positions compared to manual point marking. Significant ligament length variations were found for different abductions which was not possible with manual measurements. Acquisition related geometric distortions and inaccuracies during the registration and segmentation process were small. Conclusions: The proposed method provides superior accuracy for thein vivo analysis of ligament dynamics compared to manual measurements. This permits a better understanding of the ligament behavior during joint motion and offers new possibilities for presurgical planning which to date has not been possible with manual data analysis.

AB  - Prompt and accurate diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias can play a crucial role in ensuring appropriate counseling and management (both antenatal and postnatal). When a skeletal dysplasia is detected during the antenatal period, especially early in the pregnancy, it can be associated with a poor prognosis. It is important to make a diagnosis in antenatal presentation of skeletal dysplasias to inform diagnosis, predict prognosis, provide accurate recurrence risks, and options for prenatal genetic testing in future pregnancies. Prenatal ultrasound scanning is a useful tool to detect several skeletal dysplasias and sonographic measurements serve as reliable indicators of lethality. The lethality depends on various factors including gestational age at which features are identified, size of the chest and progression of malformations. Although, it is important to type the skeletal presentation as accurately as possible, this is not always possible in an antenatal presentation and it is important to acknowledge this uncertainty. In the case of a live birth, it is always important to reassess the infant. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by fragile bones. Here, we report an infant with severe OI born following a twin pregnancy in whom the bone disease is caused by a heterozygous pathogenic mutation, c.4160C >T, p.(Ala1387Val) located in the C-propeptide region of COL1A1. An assumption of lethality antenatally complicated his management in early life. We discuss this patient with particular emphasis on the neonatal presentation of a severe skeletal dysplasia and the lessons that may be learned in such situations. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare and often fatal soft-tissue infection involving the superficial fascial layers of the extremities, abdomen or perineum. Progression to septic shock can occur very rapidly with its associated high morbidity and mortality. NF is usually caused by beta haemolytic streptococci; less often a poly-microbial isolate is the cause. It typically occurs in patients with some degree of immune dysfunction. We present a case of severe pneumococcal necrotizing fasciitis in an obese patient with Type 2 diabetes. There was no history of trauma or evidence of diabetes-related complications. The initial presentation was with features of septic arthritis of the left knee, which subsequently progressed to NF. Differentiation from cellulitis is often difficult in the early stages. Invasive pneumococcal infections are extremely rare, with only a few reported in the literature. Moreover, our case highlights the need to consider other differential diagnoses (and to look out for complications) in patients with diabetes, especially if there is little clinical response to the initial treatment.

AB  - Objective To assess the learning curve associated with laparoscopic ovariectomy (LOE) in 618 dogs and to report perioperative complication rates. Study Design Case series. Animals Dogs (n?=?618). Methods Data retrieved from the medical records of bitches admitted for LOE over 42 months included date of surgery, breed, weight (kg), age (months), surgeon, suture material used, intraoperative complications and postoperative complications. Each LOE was defined as ?successful? or ?unsuccessful? by the absence or presence of an intraoperative complication and ?failure? rate described using a CUSUM technique. Results Follow-up time ranged from 152 to 1,435 days (median, 737 days). Intraoperative complications occurred in 10 dogs (1.6%) and included: splenic laceration (6 dogs; 1%), urinary bladder perforation (3 dogs; 0.5%), and subcutaneous emphysema (1 dog; 0.2%). Postoperative complications occurred in 99 dogs (16%) and included: incisional inflammation treated with antibiotics (87 dogs [14%]; 96/1,854 incisions; 5.1%), incisional seroma (5 dogs [0.8%]; 5/1,854 incisions, 0.3%), incisional hernia (4 dogs [0.6%]; 4/1,854 incisions, 0.2%), and ovarian remnant syndrome (3 dogs; 0.5%). CUSUM charts indicated an initial ?learning curve? of ?80 LOE. Conclusions LOE is a technique with an initial learning curve but once surgical proficiency is reached after ?80 procedures then intraoperative complication rates associated with the procedure can be low.

AB  - Summary Dyspnoea is a common presenting symptom in the older patient and is often multifactorial, with a wide differential of contributing pathologies. Dyspnoea is a distressing symptom and significantly impacts on quality of life. Older adults with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease may present with a disturbance in daily function and mental status rather more typical symptoms experienced in younger patients. Cardiac failure in older patients has a high mortality and management strategies may be complicated by other comorbidities, especially renal failure. Increasing numbers of patients are dying of end stage lung disease and may present to the Emergency Department requiring palliation of their symptoms. This chapter includes: A focus on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiac failure: including presentation, investigations and potential therapies in the older patient A discussion on the role of non-invasive and invasive ventilation in the older adult with respiratory failure A guideline to the management of end-stage lung disease in the acute setting
