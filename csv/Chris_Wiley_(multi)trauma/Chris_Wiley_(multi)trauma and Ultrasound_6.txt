AB  - Ultrasound characterization of ovarian morphology and vascularisation has become an important part of gynaecological endocrinology. PCO syndrome is the most prevalent endocrinological problem in women during reproductive period of life. The us diagnostic accuracy has advanced from recognition of ovarian size (volume), characteristic follicular distribution and volume of dense ovarian stroma, to blood flow changes in the uterine and ovarian stromal vessels. Improvement has been made by using innovations such as 3D US, colour and pulsed Doppler US, which allows US quantitative analysis of the ovarian stroma. In the PCOS the ovarian stroma is the source of hyperandrogenemia. One hundred and thirty-two patients with PCOS, diagnosed by us and endocrinological findings, underwent further clinical, US and endocrine evolution during various kinds of therapy (metformine, ovarian drilling, oral contraception, flutamide and finasteride treatment). Mean age of the PCO patients was 25.5?years (range 15?48), 59.3% were obese (BMI?=?28), 75.6% had signs of hirsutism, 43.02% presented with acne and 88.5% have had irregular menstrual cycle. Ultrasound findings (TVUS, colour and pulsed Doppler, 3D US) and hormonal evaluation (FSH, LH Androstendion, DHEA-a, T, Free T, SHBG, 3 α diol) were performed prior, during and at the end of the therapy. Comparison has been made between these five groups of patients.

AB  - Background: Pancreatic trauma is uncommon, but carries high morbidity and mortality rates, especially when diagnosis is delayed or inappropriate surgery is attempted. Although the retroperitoneal position of the pancreas confers it some immunity to injury, the force required to do so often results in severe associated injuries to other organs, which may be life threatening. Diagnosis may be difficult and surgery can be a considerable technical challenge. Methods: All patients with pancreatic trauma who attended one of three Melbourne teaching hospitals from 1977 to 1998 were identified. Injuries were graded and the method of diagnosis and treatment studied. The incidence and causation of postoperative morbidity and mortality was identified. Results: Thirty-eight patients (26 men and 12 women) were studied. Blunt trauma was responsible in 30 patients, stab wounds in five, gunshot wounds in two and iatrogenic injury in one. Injuries to other organs occurred in 30 patients. Surgical procedures were undertaken in 34 patients, resulting in the death of five and complications in 25. Conclusion: Complications and death are related to the associated injuries, as much as to the pancreatic injury itself. In this study, we review the experience of the management of pancreatic trauma in three large teaching hospitals in Melbourne over a 21-year period, and suggest a strategy for dealing with these difficult patients. Adherence to the basic concepts of control of bleeding from associated vascular injury, minimization of contamination, accurate pancreatic assessment, judicious resection and adequate drainage can diminish the risk. By approaching the problem in a systematic way and adopting a generally conservative management plan, complications and deaths can be minimized in these complex cases.

AB  - Abstract Objective The paper describes novel real-time ?in situ mapping? and ?sequential occlusion angiography? to facilitate selective ischaemia robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN) using intraoperative contrast enhanced ultrasound scan (CEUS). Materials and methods Data were collected and assessed for 60 patients (61 tumours) between 2009 and 2013. 31 (50.8%) tumours underwent ?Global Ischaemia?, 27 (44.3%) underwent ?Selective Ischaemia? and 3 (4.9%) were removed ?Off Clamp Zero Ischaemia?. Demographics, operative variables, complications, renal pathology and outcomes were assessed. Results Median PADUA score was 9 (range 7?10). The mean warm ischaemia time in selective ischaemia was less and statistically significant than in global ischaemia (17.1 and 21.4, respectively). Mean operative time was 163?min. Postoperative complications (n?=?10) included three (5%) Clavien grade 3 or above. Malignancy was demonstrated in 47 (77%) with negative margin in 43 (91.5%) and positive margin in four (8.5%). Long-term decrease in eGFR post selective ischaemia robotic partial nephrectomy was less compared with global ischaemia (four and eight, respectively) but not statistically significant. Conclusions This technique is safe, feasible and cost-effective with comparable perioperative outcomes. The technical aspects elucidate the role of intraoperative CEUS to facilitate and ascertain selective ischaemia. Further work is required to demonstrate long-term oncological outcomes. ? 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Intrauterine allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been successfully used for the prenatal treatment of severe combined immunodefiency syndrome. However, this treatment has not been successful in other conditions in which the fetus is immunologically competent. The main obstacles to success are lack of competitive advantage of donor vs. host stem cells preventing stable engraftment and graft rejection by the host immune system. Strategies to overcome these hurdles include, among others, early transplantation before 12?weeks of gestation, and increase of cells dose in the target organs (fetal liver and fetal bone marrow) which might be best achieved by the intravascular administration route. However, whilst ultrasound-guided intraperitoneal administration of the graft in the first trimester is feasible, access to the fetal circulation in the first trimester is more difficult. Combined ultrasound-guided/embryofetoscopic approach is a promising technique to achieve this goal. Thin-gauge embryofetoscopes allow the exact visualization of the optimal funipuncture site and the intravenous insertion of a 25G needle through a side-port. They thus provide an additional tool to deliver the stem cell graft to the preimmune fetus.

AB  - Background The possibility that the hyperstimulatory effect of gonadotropins may be important etiologically in the genesis of some cases of ovarian cancer is still under discussion. Few flow and image cytometric studies report on DNA aneuploid granulosa cells in follicular fluid from women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). The reports are very controversial. The aim of the study was to analyse relationship between ultrasound-determined follicular size and DNA ploidy of granulosa cells from gonadotropin-stimulated follicles. Method The granulosa-luteal cells were obtained from women undergoing an IVF-ET program at the University Department of obstetrics and Gynecology Ljubljana. Seventy aspirates of individual follicles (transvaginal determined size, range 15?mm ? 30?mm in diameter) from gonadotropin-stimulated cycles were analysed. Cytospins were prepared and fixed in delaunay fixative. All the slides were stained by the feulgen thionin method. Image DNA analyses was performed on automated high-resolution image cytometer. The DNA index was calculated to define DNA ploidy. Results All granulosa cell samples were found to be diploid. Conclusion Regardless of different ultrasound-determined size of follicles, all analysed granulosa cells have diploid DNA content.

AB  - Background Multiple lines of evidence suggest that cardiovascular co-morbidities hasten the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or accelerate its course. Methods To evaluate the utility of cerebral vascular physical function and/or condition parameters as potential systemic indicators of AD, transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound was used to assess cerebral blood flow and vascular resistance of the 16 arterial segments comprising the circle of Willis and its major tributaries. Results Our study showed that decreased arterial mean flow velocity and increased pulsatility index are associated with a clinical diagnosis of presumptive AD. Cerebral blood flow impairment shown by these parameters reflects the global hemodynamic and structural consequences of a multifaceted disease process yielding diffuse congestive microvascular pathology, increased arterial rigidity, and decreased arterial compliance, combined with putative age-associated cardiovascular output declines. Conclusions TCD evaluation offers direct physical confirmation of brain perfusion impairment and might ultimately provide a convenient and a noninvasive means to assess the efficacy of medical interventions on cerebral blood flow or reveal incipient AD. In the near term, TCD-based direct assessments of brain perfusion might offer the prospect of preventing or mitigating AD simply by revealing patients who would benefit from interventions to improve circulatory system function.

AB  - Unstimulated cycles offer a simpler, quicker and less invasive form of IVF and ICSI than the most conventional stimulated cycles. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches for follicle monitoring in unstimulated cycles. This monitoring includes studies of follicle growth during the follicular and luteal phase of the cycle, measurements of blood flow in perifollicular vessels and studies of perifollicular perfusion in vascular network using power Doppler. These studies include 3D analysis of follicular growth, development and its vascularization. A retrospective chart review of all patients undergoing IVF and ICSI in unstimulated cycles at our institution was performed. The outcome measurements used were oocyte recovery rate, fertilization rate, implantation and delivery rate. Unstimulated cycles monitored by ultrasound only were compared with those monitored with different protocols of ultrasound monitoring combined with serum estradiol level and urinary LH. IVF and ICSI were performed in 708 unstimulated cycles. A higher pregnancy rate and lower cancellation rate was obtained when hCG was applied in lower values of serum E2 and smaller follicle diameter. The actual pregnancy rate per embryo transfer in IVF cycles was 23.8% and 26.4% in ICSI cycles when embryo transfer was performed on day?+?2 or day?+?3. When blastocyst stage embryo transfer was performed the implantation rate per embryo transfer was 37.5%.

AB  - Abstract Venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) increases the risk of mortality in trauma patients. To decrease the occurrence of VTE, low dose anticoagulants are commonly prescribed. This may be unacceptable in trauma patients who have a high risk of bleeding. Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters can be employed as an alternative strategy to decrease the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE). Insertion of an IVC filter is an invasive procedure that has a range of complications. The benefits of IVC filter insertion must be compared to its risk of complications in each individual patient. A search of the literature since 2005 was conducted on MEDLINE, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Embase. The clinical question posed was does prophylactic IVC filter insertion decrease the risk of PE in trauma patients? The available evidence was low level and unable to definitively answer this question. The majority of articles infer that IVC filter insertion is safe and may decrease the risk of PE. However, there is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to be conducted in this area.

AB  - Objective To investigate the efficacy and safety of ultrasonic bone curette in treating thoracic spinal stenosis. Methods A total of 30 patients of thoracic spinal stenosis who underwent posterior thoracic decompression in the hospital from December 2015 to 2017 were enrolled. Of these, 18 patients (group A) underwent posterior thoracic decompression using ultrasonic bone curette; and 12 patients underwent the treatment using a high-speed drill (group B). The time of laminectomy, amount of intraoperative blood loss, presence or absence of cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and nerve root injury were recorded. All patients underwent X-ray, computed tomography with three-dimensional reconstruction, and magnetic resonance imaging before and after surgery. The Frankel classification and the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores were used to assess the neurological function and neurological recovery in patients. The measured data were statistically processed and analyzed using SPSS21.0 software, and the measurement data were expressed as mean?±?SD. Results In groups A and B, the average time for single-segment laminectomy was 3.3?±?1.2?min and 6.0?±?1.8?min and the mean bleeding volume was 105.5?±?43.3?mL and 177.4?±?54.7?mL, respectively, with a statistically significant difference between the groups. The difference in JOA scores before and after surgery in groups A and B was statistically significant. No significant difference was found between the groups, in group A, the improvement rate of nerve function at the last follow-up was 71% and in group B, the improvement rate at the last follow-up was 70%. In group A, at last follow-up, two patients had Frankel grade B injury, one had grade C injury, seven had grade D injury, and eight had grade E injury. In group B, at last follow-up, one patient had Frankel grade B injury, one had grade C injury, five had grade D injury, and five had grade E injury. The Frankel classification of both groups A and B significantly improved. Four patients experienced cerebrospinal fluid leakage in group A and five in group B, with no significant difference between the groups. There was no nerve root injury in both groups, and no complications, such as pulmonary infection and urinary tract infection, occurred after operation. Conclusions With the use of ultrasonic bone curette in posterior thoracic decompression, the decompression surgery could be completed relatively safely and quickly. It effectively reduced the amount of intraoperative blood loss.

Design A non-randomised control study. Setting Gynaecological department in a university teaching hospital. Population Patients with uterine fibroids. Methods From November 2014 to November 2015, 166 patients with uterine fibroids were enrolled and underwent HIFU (n = 99) and LM (n = 67) surgeries, respectively. Clinical efficacy, postoperative complications and quality of life after treatment were evaluated using the SF-36 Scale to compare the differences in each variable at the 1-year follow up. Main outcomes measures Differences in efficacy, safety and quality of life between the patients treated with HIFU and LM. Results The 12-month follow-up results showed that the HIFU group had a total effective rate of 99%; only one patient underwent alternative treatment due to non-apparent tumour shrinkage. All patients in the LM group showed complete tumour disappearance. Of these patients, 52 showed significant clinical improvement, 15 with partial clinical improvement, a total effective rate of 98%. There was no significant difference in effectivity rate between the two groups (P > 0.05). Both treatments effectively improved patients? quality of life. Compared with the LM group, patients in the HIFU group experienced no blood loss, a shorter hospital stay and fewer adverse effects and complications, the difference being statistically significant (P < 0.05). Conclusions High-intensity focused ultrasound can be as efficacious as LM therapy and effectively improve patients? quality of life in the treatment of uterine fibroids, with fewer adverse effects and complications, shorter hospital stays, and quicker postoperative recovery compared with LM therapy. Tweetable abstract Patients with uterine fibroids can be effectively treated with both HIFU and myomectomy.

AB  - Introduction Hemothorax is a rare but life-threatening complication following mini-endoscopic combined intrarenal surgery. Herein, we describe a patient with left staghorn kidney stone who presented with hemothorax following mini-endoscopic combined intrarenal surgery under ureteroscope-assisted ultrasound-guided access. Case presentation A 47-year-old woman with left staghorn kidney stone underwent mini-endoscopic combined intrarenal surgery, after which she developed shortness of breath. Chest radiography and computed tomography confirmed left hemothorax. Conservative management and left intercostal chest drainage were performed without improvement. Subsequently, video-assisted thoracoscopic debridement was performed. Conclusion Hemothorax is a severe complication of mini-endoscopic combined intrarenal surgery, which, regardless of accurate access through an ideal renal calyx under ureteroscope-assisted ultrasound-guided access, may lead to pleural injury. Refinement of the surgical technique and management after percutaneous nephrolithotomy is the key to avoiding life-threatening situations.

AB  - Abstract:? Decreased perfusion and trauma during laparoscopic harvesting are proposed causative factors for DGF and rejection in children following renal transplantation with laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN) allograft. We performed a retrospective review of 11 children who underwent LDN transplant and 11 preceding patients who underwent ODN transplant. Intraoperative DUS findings, creatinine values and clearance, time to nadir creatinine and AR episodes were compared. There were no significant differences in the BMI, vascular anatomy, side of nephrectomy, or warm ischemia time in the two groups. Mean follow-up duration was 11.4 and 30.4 months in LDN and ODN groups. DUS showed initial turbulent flow in five of the LDN and four of the ODN group with an average RI of 0.59 and 0.66 in the ODN and LDN groups, respectively (NS). Three patients in the ODN group had an abnormal RI compared to none in the LDN group (p?=?0.034). The creatinine values, creatinine clearances (at 24?h, one, four?wk and last follow-up) and AR episodes were similar in both groups. Pneumoperitoneum during LDN does not appear to have an adverse impact on early graft reperfusion.

AB  - Aim To prevent the syndrome of severe ovarian hyperstimulation in IVF/ET cycles at high risk for the syndome of ovarian hyperstimulation by early timed unilateral ultrasound guided aspiration of one ovary (12?h after hCG). Method. We evaluated the preventive effect of ETFA by analysing the data on 821 cycles at high risk for SOHSS performed during the years 1987?99. In all cycles the high risk for SOHSS was defined by the estradiol values >?3000?pg/ml and more than 8 follicles >?14?mm plus intermediate and small follicles in each ovary on ultrasound. Results In the group of :729 female infertility cycles at high risk for SOHSS with preventive ETFA there were no cases of SOHSS. In the control group of 92 IVF/ET female infertility without ETFA there were 12 cases of SOHSS (P?<?0.0001). No difference in live birth rate (17% vs. 16%) was noted. The results prove the preventive effect of ETFA. It is based on early timed withdrawal of paracine substances which are present in the follicular fluid. Conclusion The vaginal ultrasound guided ETFA is another successful option to decrease the incidence of severe OHSS in assisted reproduction.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Interstitial photodynamic therapy remains an attractive remedial option in minimally invasive surgery. Our aim in this prospective study was to evaluate the outcome following ultrasound-guided iPDT of deep-seated pathologies. Patients' reports on quality of life with clinical and radiological evaluation were the main end point parameters used to assess the outcome. Materials and Methods Sixty-eight patients were referred to the UCLH Head and Neck Centre for treatment of various deep-seated pathologies involving the head and neck region, upper and lower limbs. All patients underwent interstitial photodynamic therapy under general anaesthesia, using 0.15?mg/kg mTHPC as the photosensitising agent. Following treatment, patients were followed-up for a mean of 7 months. Results All three patients who presented with visual problems reported improvement after treatment. Also, 14/17 patients reported improvement of breathing. Improvement of swallowing was reported by 25/30 patients; while speaking improvement was evident in 16/22 patients and 33/40 reported reduction in the disfigurement caused by their pathology. All five patients with impeded limb function reported some degree of improvement. Clinical assessment showed that half of the patients had ?good response? to the treatment and a third reported ?moderate response? with two patients being free of disease. Radiological assessment comparing imaging 6-week post-PDT to the baseline showed stable pathology with no change in size in 13 patients, minimal response in 18 patients, moderate response in 23 patients and significant response in 11 patients. Conclusion This study on 68 patients with deep-seated pathologies undergoing interstitial photodynamic therapy provided evidence that PDT can be the fourth modality in the management of tissue disease.

AB  - Physiologic change of spiral arteries is important adaptation of maternal vascular network for ongoing pregnancy. It is characterised by destruction of muscular layer of these vessels changing them to a low resistance vascular channels. Physiologic change was found to be incomplete in pregnancies complicated by pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). These changes were detected in vitro in histrologic studies but recently were investigated in vivo using Doppler ultrasound. In normal pregnancy the impedance to blood flow in spiral arteries measured by resistance (RI) and pulsatility (PI) indices significantly decrease toward the mid trimester (P?<?0.05) and then remains stable. Similar observation was found in pregnancies complicated by PIH and IUGR. Both of these represent the second wave of trophoblastic invasion of spiral arteries. In pregnancies complicated by PIH and IUGR measured impedance indices were significantly higher compared to the matched normotensive women with normal fetal growth (P?<?0.05), representing ht failure of the complete physiologic change of the spiral arteries. This is in concordance with histologic studies. Comparing the significance levels of blood flow in proximal and distal parts of uteroplacental circulation between investigated groups, the higher significance levels were obtained in terminal parts. This can have serious implication in designing further research protocols of the screening programmes for the PIH and IUGR based on the blood flow in uteroplacental circulation.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to determine whether three-dimensional ultrasound (3-D US) can improve the diagnostic ability in a routine check-up of patients undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) in an office practice. Methods Three-dimensional and power Doppler ultrasound were performed on 267 patients undergoing IVF on the first visit, during ovulation induction and aspiration of the oocytes. Patients with suspected uterine anomalies and/or abnormalities of the endometrium (N?=?108) were treated by operative hysteroscopy. On the day of oocyte collection, multiplanar imaging and 3-D reconstruction demonstrated cumuli in follicles greater than 15?mm. Cumulus assessment inside the ovarian follicles was correlated to the number of mature oocytes. Power Doppler reconstruction was performed in the cases when superponing vessels did not allow correct placing of the puncture needle. Results Of 108 patients with suspected uterine abnormality, the diagnosis was correct in all cases of endometrial polyp, submucous myoma, arcuate uteri and septate uteri, as confirmed by an office hysteroscopy. Intrauterine synechiae was correctly diagnosed preoperatively in one out of the four cases. The mean (±?SD) number of follicles >?18?mm was 8.2?±?5.8, and total number of follicles demonstrating cumulus in all three planes was 6.4?±?5.1. The ratio cumuli/retrieved oocytes, cumuli/fertilised oocytes and cumuli/mature oocytes was 6.2?±?4.2, 5.4?±?2.8 and 5.9?±?2.6, respectively. Conclusions Three dimensional ultrasound can become a standard of routine check-up of infertility patients allowing improved recognition of the uterine anatomy, characterisation of the surface features, and precise depiction of the ovaries during stimulation cycles. It can enhance and facilitate the morphologic and functional evaluation of the anatomic structures of the inner reproductive organs, thus avoiding the need of invasive diagnostic procedures. Various puncturing procedures can be more precisely performed. The built-in application of live 3-D mode may be very helpful in performing invasive procedures, such as oocyte collection.
