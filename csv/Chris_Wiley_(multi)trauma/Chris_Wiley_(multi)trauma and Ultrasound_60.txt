AB  - Abstract Objective To describe a large segmental (sub-total) mandibulectomy for removal of an undifferentiated sarcoma in a horse. Study Design Clinical report. Animals A 10-year-old mare. Methods A combination of methods including computed tomography (CT) were used to diagnose a large undifferentiated sarcoma of the right mandible. A large segmental mandibulectomy extending from 3?cm below the right temporomandibular joint to immediately caudal to tooth 407 was used to perform an en-bloc resection of the mass under general anesthesia. Results Surgery time was 11?hours and 35?minutes and total anesthesia time, 12?hours and 40?minutes. The mare was eating well 3 days after surgery. Some postoperative skin sloughing occurred, but the cosmetic and functional outcome was good. The mare continued to do well, with no evidence of disease recurrence, 24 months after surgery. Conclusions Three-dimensional reconstruction of the CT images was instrumental in surgical planning. A very large portion of the mandible can be removed in a horse with acceptable cosmetic and functional outcome.

AB  - Abstract The concept of freestanding EDs is a popular operational model of emergency care in the USA. This model has been described as an emergency physician-created innovative solution in resolving ongoing overcrowding issues in EDs. A decentralised community-based emergency care model may be a solution to meet the increasing demand for emergency and unscheduled acute care in Australia. It may also help to reduce the number of acute hospital admissions through EDs. The aim of freestanding EDs should be to manage and discharge a cohort of patients, mainly in Australasian Triage Scale 3 and 4 categories, currently seen in hospital-based EDs. This article briefly examines the potential merits and issues if this concept is considered in Australia. It also provides an early proposed model for such EDs.

AB  - Abstract The past 40 years have seen expanded development of emergency medicine (EM) postgraduate residency training programs worldwide. An important part of this educational experience is the ability of resident trainees to participate in experiences abroad. However, little is known about how these experiences shape trainees and the populations they serve. During the 2013 Academic Emergency Medicine consensus conference, a group of educators met to define and outline current trends in graduate medical education (GME) emergency care research. The authors discuss future research questions bridging the gap of GME and global health.

AB  - Summary Ruminants and swine offer a unique set of challenges when undergoing general anesthesia. Pigs specifically have the propensity to be particularly challenging due to their reaction to handling and restraint, thick skin with limited venous access, and unique upper airway anatomy that can lead to potential difficult intubation. With proper planning and the right equipment, ruminants and swine can be safely and successfully anesthetized. This chapter focuses on the equipment essential to anesthetize these species and details species-specific recommendations.

AB  - Abstract The improvement of fat graft viability might depend on the presence of multipotent resident adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) which is the important component of stromal vascular fraction (SVF). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiogenin-1 (Ang-1) are responsible for neovascularization. However, their half-life is too short to produce a biological effect. We thus investigated whether VEGF-ANG-1-polylactic acid (PLA) microspheres could enhance the angiogenic properties of ADSCs. PLA microspheres containing VEGF and ANG-1 were prepared by in vitro ultrasonic emulsification and characterized according to their encapsulation efficiency (EE), drug-loading rate (DL), particle size, and drug release. The systemic toxicity of empty loaded nanospheres (NPs) and the ability of these microspheres to promote the proliferation and differentiation of ADSCs were evaluated. The EE and DL were above 86 and 2.8%, respectively. The drug release was completed after 20 days. Systemic toxicity was verified in ADSCs that received the unloaded NPs. It was observed that ADSCs treated with VEGF-ANG-1-PLA microspheres had an increase in the proliferation and the number of CD31 positive cells. ADSCs proliferation and differentiation toward endothelial cells (ECs) could be enhanced by the addition of VEGF-ANG-1-PLA nano-sustained release microspheres.

AB  - Abstract Background Accuracy of needle tip placement and needle tracking in soft tissue are of particular importance in many medical procedures. In recent years, developing autonomous and teleoperated systems for needle insertion has become an active area of research. Methods In this study, needle insertion was performed using a master?slave set-up with multi-degrees of freedom. The effect of force feedback on the accuracy of needle insertion was investigated. In addition, this study compared autonomous, teleoperated and semi-autonomous needle insertion. Results The results of this study show that incorporation of force feedback can improve teleoperated needle insertion. However, autonomous and semi-autonomous needle insertions, which use feedback from a deflection model, provide significantly better performance. Conclusions Development of a haptic master?slave needle insertion system, which is capable of performing some autonomous tasks based on feedback from tissue deformation and needle deflection models, can improve the performance of autonomous robotics-based insertions as well as non-autonomous teleoperated manual insertions.

AB  - Background. This study was carried out to evaluate the urodynamic and ultrasonographic findings after tension-free vagina tape (TVT) procedure on stress urinary incontinent women. Methods. Ninety women suffering from genuine stress incontinence without pelvic relaxation syndrome underwent surgery. Urodynamic measurement, one-hour pad test and introital ultrasonographic evaluation were performed preoperatively and one year after surgery. Additional ultrasonographic surveillance of the urethra was performed immediately after the operation. The position and mobility of the bladder neck was compared pre- and post-operatively in relation to the inferior edge of the pubic symphysis. Result. Eight women were excluded for various reasons. Among the 82 women who completed the study, 76 (93%) were cured, four were improved and two failed. No major intra- or post-operative complications occurred. The position and mobility of the bladder neck showed no significant difference before and after surgery. A urethral knee angle was noted ultrasonographically on cured and improved patients during maximum straining. Nine patients with immediate postoperative voiding difficulty were found to have a pronounced mid-urethra angulation. The symptom and sign were resolved by time after urethra depressing. Urodynamic assessment of the urethral pressure profile and other parameter showed no significant difference before and after the surgery except that a positive pressure transmission in the middle portion of the urethra was noted among 70 (87.5%) of cured and improved subjects. Conclusion. Tension-free vagina tape operation is an effective surgical procedure for the treatment of female urinary stress incontinence. The procedure seems neither to change hypermobility nor to elevate the position of bladder neck. Urinary continence after surgery is most probably achieved by creating a dynamic mid-urethral knee angulation by which the urethra is closed i.e. kinked at stress. Lifting of the mid-urethra resulted in postoperative voiding difficulty. It is the important that the tape is placed tension free under the urethra. Introital ultrasonographic surveillance is a suitable technique to visualize the result of the operation.

AB  - Although ?insignificant? prostate cancer has been examined separately in radical prostatectomy (RP) and radical cystoprostatectomy (RCP) studies, it is not entirely clear whether cancers designated as ?insignificant? on RP and RCP represent the same, similar or different forms of prostate cancer. Insignificant prostate cancer has been traditionally defined based on the pathological findings in the whole prostate gland. In addition to the pathological determinants of ?insignificant? prostate cancer, it is also important to account for the biological and the clinical context of the disease, as well as patient age and health status to designate a prostate cancer ?insignificant?. This review examines and compares prostate cancers described as ?insignificant? on RP and RCP. We conclude that in most cases these low-volume/low-grade prostate cancers represent an early stage and clinically ?silent? disease, which are only detected in different clinical settings.

AB  - Purpose: An innovative, simple, and fast method to optimize the number and position of catheters is presented for prostate and breast high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy, both for arbitrary templates or template-free implants (such as robotic templates). Methods: Eight clinical cases were chosen randomly from a bank of patients, previously treated in our clinic to test our method. The 2D Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations (CVT) algorithm was adapted to distribute catheters uniformly in space, within the maximum external contour of the planning target volume. The catheters optimization procedure includes the inverse planning simulated annealing algorithm (IPSA). Complete treatment plans can then be generated from the algorithm for different number of catheters. The best plan is chosen from different dosimetry criteria and will automatically provide the number of catheters and their positions. After the CVT algorithm parameters were optimized for speed and dosimetric results, it was validated against prostate clinical cases, using clinically relevant dose parameters. The robustness to implantation error was also evaluated. Finally, the efficiency of the method was tested in breast interstitial HDR brachytherapy cases. Results: The effect of the number and locations of the catheters on prostate cancer patients was studied. Treatment plans with a better or equivalent dose distributions could be obtained with fewer catheters. A better or equal prostate V100 was obtained down to 12 catheters. Plans with nine or less catheters would not be clinically acceptable in terms of prostate V100 and D90. Implantation errors up to 3 mm were acceptable since no statistical difference was found when compared to 0 mm error (p > 0.05). No significant difference in dosimetric indices was observed for the different combination of parameters within the CVT algorithm. A linear relation was found between the number of random points and the optimization time of the CVT algorithm. Because the computation time decrease with the number of points and that no effects were observed on the dosimetric indices when varying the number of sampling points and the number of iterations, they were respectively fixed to 2500 and to 100. The computation time to obtain ten complete treatments plans ranging from 9 to 18 catheters, with the corresponding dosimetric indices, was 90 s. However, 93% of the computation time is used by a research version of IPSA. For the breast, on average, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recommendations would be satisfied down to 12 catheters. Plans with nine or less catheters would not be clinically acceptable in terms of V100, dose homogeneity index, and D90. Conclusions: The authors have devised a simple, fast and efficient method to optimize the number and position of catheters in interstitial HDR brachytherapy. The method was shown to be robust for both prostate and breast HDR brachytherapy. More importantly, the computation time of the algorithm is acceptable for clinical use. Ultimately, this catheter optimization algorithm could be coupled with a 3D ultrasound system to allow real-time guidance and planning in HDR brachytherapy.
