AB  - Abstract The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) is difficult with many patients treated without the disease or left untreated without an adequate diagnostic work up. Recent advances in PE diagnosis are reviewed. The use of risk stratification in PE diagnosis is strongly recommended and evidence on how it can best be performed summarized. The Ginsberg/Wells stratification rule is recommended currently as the best validated rule. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was found to have quite poor sensitivity and to be poorly validated. It is recommended as adequate as a positive test in moderate/high risk groups and an exclusionary test in low risk groups or where an adequate alternative diagnosis is found. For D-Dimer tests the only test with adequate sensitivity and validation in management studies is the VIDAS? D-Dimer. This is in low/intermediate risk groups in the ED population. The Simpli-Red? test is also reviewed but is too insensitive for most populations. Echocardiography: this is good in compromised patients as it is a bedside test which when negative virtually excludes PE. If positive in the right setting it has a high positive predictive value. A negative echocardiogram predicts a benign clinical course for PE. The rest of the paper details the authors approach to integrating these new techniques with established algorithms and where progress is likely to occur in the next few years. These include improvements in CTPA (plus the addition of CT venography), new point of care D-Dimer tests, better risk stratification rules and integration of new strategies with artificial neural networks or computerized guidelines.

AB  - Summary Background:? Retroperitoneal haematoma is a rare clinical entity with variable aetiology, which is increasing in incidence mainly due to complications related to interventional procedures. There is no general consensus as to the best management plan for patients with retroperitoneal haematoma. Methods:? A literature review was undertaken using MEDLINE, all relevant papers on retroperitoneal haemorrhage or haematoma were used. Results:? The diagnosis is often delayed as symptoms are nonspecific. Retroperitoneal haematoma should be suspected in patients with significant groin, flank, abdominal, back pain or haemodynamic instability following an interventional procedure. Spontaneous haemorrhage usually occurs in patients who are anticoagulated. Multi-slice CT and arteriography are important for diagnosis. Most haemodynamically stable patients can be managed with fluid resuscitation, correction of coagulopathy and blood transfusion. Endovascular treatment involving selective intra-arterial embolisation or the deployment of stent-grafts over the punctured vessel is attaining an increasingly important role. Open repair of retroperitoneal bleeding vessels should be reserved for cases when there is failure of conservative or endovascular measures to control the bleeding. Open repair is also required if endovascular facilities or expertise is unavailable and in cases where the patient is unstable. If treated inappropriately, the mortality of patients with retroperitoneal haematoma remains high. Conclusion:? There is a lack of level I evidence for the best management plans for retroperitoneal haematoma, and evidence is based on small cohort series or isolated case reports. Conservative management should only be reserved for patients who are stable. Interventional radiology with intra-arterial embolisation or stent-grafting is the treatment of choice. Open surgery is now rarely required.

AB  - Summary Metabolic disturbances may present with non-specific symptoms and signs and can be easily missed if blood tests are not undertaken. Advancing age is a risk factor for acute kidney injury, and is associated with a higher mortality and reduced renal recovery. Standard diagnostic criteria may miss acute kidney injury in the older patient. Sodium disturbances may be multifactorial and the cause may be more difficult to determine in the older patient. Symptoms and signs are largely related to speed of onset. Hypercalcaemia requiring emergency treatment is most often due to malignancy. This chapter includes: An outline of age related changes in the kidney Classification, management, and complications of acute kidney injury A summary of common causes of hyponatraemia A guide to the emergency management of hyponatraemia and hypercalcaemia

AB  - Abstract There is growing recognition of the vital roles that Emergency Physicians can play in public health. Accordingly, there is a need for emergency medicine trainees to have opportunities to acquire relevant public health skillsets. This article provides an example of such a possibility. It describes the experience of an emergency medicine trainee in undertaking a 6 month training rotation at a Public Health Unit. The example illustrates the feasibility and benefits of a public health rotation for interested trainees, and offers recommendations for establishing such rotations. There are challenges, including eligibility requirements and funding. However, possible approaches exist at the individual and college levels to facilitate such training opportunities so that emergency medicine trainees can acquire necessary and valuable public health skills.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: From histopathological studies of peripheral nerves in leprosy, it is known that the epineurium can be thickened. We measured the epineurial thickness of the ulnar nerve by high resolution sonography (HRUS). Methods: The epineurium of the ulnar nerve was measured above the elbow on transverse scan in 25 healthy controls and 26 leprosy patients. Results: The mean epineurial thickness was 0.77 mm (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66?0.88) in symptomatic ulnar nerves (n = 20), 0.58 mm (CI 0.51?0.65) in asymptomatic nerves (n = 30), and 0.49 mm (CI 0.44?0.54) in healthy controls (n = 25) (P = 0.0001). This thickening was related to the cross-sectional area of the ulnar nerve, but not with increased blood flow. Conclusions: The epineurium of the ulnar nerve can be measured with the use of HRUS, and it is often strikingly thickened in leprosy patients, especially in those with ulnar involvement.

AB  - Summary This chapter commences with the management of suspected giant cell arteritis (GCA). It is recommended to consider vasculitis in the patient with systemic symptoms and headache or evidence of organ dysfunction. The diagnosis of a specific vasculitis is based on the pattern of organ injury, characteristic features on imaging, the size of involved blood vessels and histological findings on biopsy. GCA usually presents with new-onset headache in older people, associated with constitutional upset; it carries a significant risk (20-30%) of visual loss from ischaemic optic neuropathy, and so needs urgent assessment and treatment. Typical presentations of acute vasculitis include headache, neurological presentation with stroke, hearing loss, and haemoptysis. With the exception of suspected GCA, early intervention with high-dose corticosteroid therapy is rarely needed, and should not be given unless advised by a specialist. The chapter also presents information on considerations in suspected GCA and new presentation of suspected systemic vasculitis.

AB  - Background? It is estimated that skin cancers cost $33 million per annum to the New Zealand healthcare system. Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are the commonest types of non melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs). Anecdotal evidence indicates that there has been a doubling in the incidence of NMSCs in New Zealand over the last decade. Because of the high incidence mandatory reporting of NMSCs to the National Cancer Registry is not required. This lack of accurate data has led to poor health care policies and strategies including funding and workforce planning. Aims? The aims of this study are to (1) present the latest statistics on NMSCs in New Zealand, including the incidence across different regions over the last decade, patient demographics, anatomic distribution of NMSCs, incidence and sites of metastasis, and disease-specific survival; to (2) the histopathology of NMSCs, including surgical margins, histologic grade, and perineural, lymphatic, and vascular invasion; and (3) the relative role of different faculties treating NMSCs. Method? This project has been approved by the multi-centre ethics committee. A retrospective review was conducted from patients? histology records from public and private pathology laboratories within defined catchment areas. Criterion for analysis is a confirmed diagnosis of NMSC treated surgically. A Microsoft Access database is created that will facilitate subsequent data retrieval and analysis. Results and Conclusion? It is hoped that this up-to-date data will form the framework for the development of sound and sustainable healthcare policies of management of NMSCs including management strategies and workforce planning, and research direction on this common disease.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: High concentrations of lactate approx. 10?mM are characteristic of wound healing. We have previously shown that lactate instigates release of VEGF from macrophages and endothelial cells. Our present study uses an in vivo murine Matrigel model to study how lactate enhances vascular development and repair. METHODS: Matrigel is a reconstituted basement membrane complex, a liquid at 4 degree C. When injected subcutaneously, it reconstitutes as a gel. 30?mgs of finely divided polylactate polymer (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) was mixed with 1cc of Matrigel, and 2 injections were made into the dorsum of each of 60 (average 7/group), 6-month-old Swiss Webster mice. The gel implants were harvested at 3, 6, 9, 11 and 16 days post injection, and were fixed in buffered formalin or frozen. Cell migration and vascular development were assessed using H&E, anti-CD31 and anti-MAC3 antibody stainings for leukocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages. Cells and vessels were quantified microscopically. RESULTS: Control implants (without polylactate) developed little or no inflammation or angiogenesis. Polylactated implants developed highly significant number of endothelial cells and recognizable vessels at 6 and 9 days. At 11 and 16 days, sizeable vessels with surrounding connective tissue were found. Though a moderate inflammation occurred in the lactate groups, no foreign body reaction was seen. Larger implants of high molecular weight instigated little inflammation and few vessels. CONCLUSION: Slowly released lactate leads to the formation of new vessels. Our results provide support for further clinical applications of lactate polymer in wounds. NIH/NIGMS Trauma Training Grant

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a thermal mode Erbium:YAG laser several in-vivo morphological as well as clinical changes were monitored in a multi-center investigation. Study Design/Materials and Methods An Erbium:YAG laser was used at a thermal mode with sub-ablative fluences of 2.1 and 3.1 J/cm2 with parallel air cooling to treat either periorbital, perioral rhytides or patients with post-traumatic or acne scars. Two treatments were applied 2 months apart, with follow-up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. Photographs were taken before and at each follow-up visit and evaluated by three blinded independent reviewers. Histology and immunohistochemistry for pro-collagen expression were investigated. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed before, and at 4, 14, and 28 days after single pass treatment with Erbium:YAG thermal pulses. Results The improvement of rhytides at 1?3 months follow-up was graded as excellent in 19%, good in 19%, fair in 31%, and no improvement in 31%. At the 6- to 12-month follow-up, the improvement was excellent in 40%, good in 40%, fair in 20%, and no improvement in 0%. The improvement of scars at 3?6 months follow-up was graded as excellent in 50%, good in 25%, fair in 25%, and no improvement in 0%. Intra- and post-operative discomfort was described as mild by the patients. OCT, histological sections and immunohistochemistry demonstrated production of new collagen bundles. Conclusions Thermal Erbium:YAG pulses can induce collagen neogenesis, as proved by temperature elevation and morphological changes in the upper dermis. This leads clinically to visible and long lasting reduction of wrinkles and scars after applying multiple passes with minimal side-effects. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To describe the characteristics of patients who presented to the ED from a ladder-related fall and their injuries, highlight the impact of ladder-related falls on the ED, identify contributing factors of ladder falls and draw recommendations to improve ladder safety. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted in two EDs. Patients? demographics and ED services used were obtained from medical records. A 53-item questionnaire was used to gather information about the type of ladder used, ladder activity, circumstances of the fall, contributing factors and future recommendations. Results A total of 177 patients were recruited for this study. The typical patient was male, over the age of 50 and using a domestic ladder. The ED length of stay was between 30 min and 16 h, and was longer if patients were transferred to the short stay unit. Services most utilised in the ED included diagnostic tests, procedures and referrals to other healthcare teams. Most falls occurred because of ladder movement and slips or misstep. The major contributing factors identified were a combination of user features and flaws in ladder setup. Conclusions Ladder-related falls carry a considerable burden to the ED. Recommendations include ladder safety interventions that target ladder users most at risk of falls: men, ≥50 years old and performing domestic tasks. Safety interventions should emphasise task avoidance, education and training, utilisation of safety equipment and appropriate ladder setup.

AB  - Intercostal catheter placement is common practice in the management of haemothorax and pneumothorax, with over 12,000 being inserted per year (1) in Australian hospitals. It is however an invasive procedure with the potential for significant iatrogenic injury. This is even more pertinent in the trauma setting where stress levels are high and time may be limited. Historically, complications that have been associated with intercostal catheter placement include: lung parenchymal laceration, bleeding from intercostal vessel injury, cardiac injury, ectopic tube placement, empyema, diaphragmatic and intra-abdominal organ laceration. In an attempt to minimise and avoid these complications, there has been a shift in the teaching of the method of tube placement from that of a trocar technique to the blunt dissection (EMST) approach (2). While this will hopefully reduce the rate of procedural complications, it still may not guarantee clinical practice free of complications. Furthermore when these complications are suspected, there is a need for repeated clinical assessment (at times, independent of imaging) in order to allow the early identification any such iatrogenic injury. The presentation will provide a review of the literature and outline the various forms of iatrogenic injury associated with tube thoracostomy; highlight the importance of clinical reassessment following intercostal catheter placement, with particular reference to a case presentation; and discuss techniques to avoid and minimise potential complications.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background and objective:? The aim of this study was to explore the pathogenesis of chronic cough caused by non-acid reflux. Methods:? Seven patients with chronic cough due to non-acid reflux, 12 patients with chronic cough due to acid reflux, 10 patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease without cough and 12 healthy volunteers were recruited for the study. All subjects underwent oesophageal multi-channel intraluminal impedance measurements combined with pH monitoring, and assessment of cough reflex sensitivity to capsaicin and induced sputum cytology. The concentrations of substance P, mast cell tryptase, prostaglandin D2 and histamine in induced sputum were measured by ELISA. Results:? Cough threshold C2 and C5 did not differ between patients with chronic cough due to non-acid or acid reflux, but the values were significantly lower than those for patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease without cough and healthy volunteers. Weakly acidic reflux episodes were obviously more frequent in patients with chronic cough due to non-acid reflux than in the other three groups. Sputum substance P and mast cell tryptase concentrations were remarkably increased in patients with chronic cough, but were similar for those with cough due to non-acid or acid reflux. There were significant inverse correlations between substance P levels and cough threshold C2 or C5 in patients with cough due to non-acid or acid reflux, and between mast cell tryptase levels and cough threshold C2 in patients with cough due to acid reflux. Conclusions:? Chronic cough due to non-acid reflux may be related to cough reflex hypersensitivity caused by neurogenic airway inflammation and mast cell activation, in which weakly acidic reflux is possibly a major factor.
