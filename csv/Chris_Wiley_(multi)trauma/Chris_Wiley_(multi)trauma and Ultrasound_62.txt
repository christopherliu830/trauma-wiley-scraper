AB  - Intercostal catheter placement is common practice in the management of haemothorax and pneumothorax, with over 12,000 being inserted per year (1) in Australian hospitals. It is however an invasive procedure with the potential for significant iatrogenic injury. This is even more pertinent in the trauma setting where stress levels are high and time may be limited. Historically, complications that have been associated with intercostal catheter placement include: lung parenchymal laceration, bleeding from intercostal vessel injury, cardiac injury, ectopic tube placement, empyema, diaphragmatic and intra-abdominal organ laceration. In an attempt to minimise and avoid these complications, there has been a shift in the teaching of the method of tube placement from that of a trocar technique to the blunt dissection (EMST) approach (2). While this will hopefully reduce the rate of procedural complications, it still may not guarantee clinical practice free of complications. Furthermore when these complications are suspected, there is a need for repeated clinical assessment (at times, independent of imaging) in order to allow the early identification any such iatrogenic injury. The presentation will provide a review of the literature and outline the various forms of iatrogenic injury associated with tube thoracostomy; highlight the importance of clinical reassessment following intercostal catheter placement, with particular reference to a case presentation; and discuss techniques to avoid and minimise potential complications.

AB  - Objective To investigate the ability of shape memory Dacron polymer vascular coils to induce the complete, gradual occlusion of the canine jugular vein. Study Design Observational pilot study. Animals Nine purpose-bred dogs. Methods Eighteen coils were deployed in nine dogs using fluoroscopic-guided percutaneous transvenous coil implantation. Individual coil formulations varied around a Dacron polymer base. Jugular vein diameter, percent vessel occlusion, and thrombus echogenicity were monitored at weekly intervals using ultrasonography. Affected jugular veins were harvested at 6 weeks post-implantation and histopathological analysis was performed to assess adventitial fibrosis, intimal layer thickening, and inflammation. Results Ten coils migrated from the jugular veins to the pulmonary vasculature within 0?2 weeks following implantation. Three jugular veins achieved at least 90% occlusion at six weeks. Histopathology of these jugular veins revealed marked perivascular thickening and fibrovascular proliferation, increased infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes, and abundant fibroplasia. Conclusions Complete, gradual occlusion of a jugular vein was achieved in three dogs. Significant vessel wall reaction and inflammation can induce gradual vessel occlusion when a Dacron coil remains implanted within the jugular vein. Dacron polymer coils could be a feasible treatment option for the gradual occlusion of congenital portosystemic shunts in dogs using minimally invasive, percutaneous transvenous implantation.

AB  - Introduction:? Today, the claims on the anatomical education have changed with the considerable increase of modern medical imaging. For the analysis of computed tomography (CT) images, magnetic resonance (MR) images or ultrasound, the knowledge of cross sectional anatomy is an important prerequisite for proper diagnosis. Admittedly, it is difficult for students and also for practitioners to imagine three-dimensional objects in space. The possibilities and convenience of 3D-reconstructions were demonstrated by generating virtual casts of frontal sinuses. Methods:? Using a HiSpeed (DX/i Plus, General Electric) scanner transversal CT images of Persian and European Shorthair cats were acquired. The slice thickness and distance were set to 1?mm. With the software system VG Studio MAX 1.1, the obtained volumetric data was used to create volume graphics displaying object surfaces and interiors based on voxel data. Because of density value acquisition, it was possible to identify and label the objects of interest. The extension of the paranasal sinuses was analyzed and demonstrated in relation to the skull. For verification, conventional corrosion casting employing Technovit or Tensolcement, respectively, were carried out on the same specimens. Results:? The frontal sinuses of both feline breeds showed great variations in size, shape and symmetry. With models from the skull based on 3D-datasets including the virtual casts of the paranasal sinuses, it was easy to imagine spatial relations and localizations inside the head. The advantages of the virtually derived casting method are: creating the virtual casts in vivo; the method does not imply any health risks and is repeatedly applicable. Conclusion:? 3D-reconstructions based on CT-datasets are excellently suited for generating spatial sense. Additionally, a single scan series can be applied for different anatomical problems. The resulting digital 3D-objects are readily available and can be employed for educational purposes for better comprehension of the difficult spatial relations of the head.

AB  - Abstract Peripheral intravenous cannula (PIVC) placement is often an essential emergency medicine precursor to lifesaving treatment, but it is not harmless. Patients frequently and without proper consideration of the consequences receive a ?just-in-case? PIVCs as part of their assessment and admission, which, in a not insignificant number of patients, remains unused or idle in situ. We reviewed the literature and performed a thematic analysis of data collated from 21 articles published in the past 24?years regarding redundant PIVCs. The following five common themes emerged: heterogeneous prevalence data on post-insertion PIVC usage, preventable intravascular complications, financial burden, loss of time and a culture of over-investigating. The prevalence of PIVC insertions and idle PIVCs was heterogeneous among these publications; the median ED idle PIVC prevalence value was 32.4%. This practice is associated with compromised patient safety, squandered finances and misdirected practitioner time. Cultures of convenience and shortfalls in PIVC-related education facilitate the prevalence of idle PIVCs.

AB  - Introduction:? Electric fields of the magnitude likely to occur in electrical injury can result in skeletal muscle electroporation. It has been reported that Poloxamer 188 (P188) is able to seal damaged cell membranes. Using a previously described rat hind limb model of electrical injury, in this study we employ MRI to demonstrate that intravenously administered P188 arrests muscle tissue edema caused by electrical shock. Methods:? Anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rat hindlimbs were subjected to 12 electrical shock pulses of 2?kV and ?2A amplitude with duration of 4?ms. There was a 10-second separation period between shocks to allow thermal relaxation. Animals received either P188 or Lactated Ringer?s Injection (control) intravenously at 60 minutes after shock. Proton MRI were recorded using a 4.7-Tesla Bruker scanner (200?MHz). A Multi-Slice Multi-Echo (MSME) spin echo sequence was used to obtain T2-weighted images. Ten slices over the entire midthigh region were taken. For each slice, images from 10 echos in the TE range of 10?ms?100?ms and TR?=?2000?ms were collected. Imaging began at 60 minutes and continued until 3 hours postshock. The signal intensities at different TE times were used to fit an exponential decay and measure the T2 value in each voxel. Voxels with T2 values?>?80?ms were considered injured. Results:? There were noticeable increases of injured area with time for electrically injured limbs due to development of edema. Control-treated rats averaged a 58.0%(±6.59% SD) increase in total area of injury. The total area of injury for P188-treated rats increased by 46.6%(±2.96% SD) In nonelectroporation limbs, no change in T2 occurred. Discussion:? Disruption of the plasma membrane due to electrical current leads to edema. We treated the injured muscles with P188 and observed that it helped to arrest edema. MRI proved effective not only in characterizing the degree of injury resulting from electrical shock but also in monitoring therapeutic efficacy.

AB  - A 14-year-old domestic shorthair cat was presented with hypoglycaemia and seizures of several weeks duration. Bloodwork revealed hypoglycaemia (1·83 mmol/l; reference range 4·22-8·05 mmol/l) with concurrent normal insulin levels (171 pmol/l; reference range 72-583 pmol/l). An insulinoma was suspected and medical and dietary management were attempted with minimal success. An exploratory laparotomy was performed and a single, well-defined mass was found within the left lobe of the pancreas. The mass was removed and histologically classified as an islet cell carcinoma, consistent with an insulinoma. The cat had an episode of presumed postoperative pancreatitits, but recovered with appropriate treatment. The cat has had no clinical signs of recurrence of greater than 32 months postsurgery. There are only four cases of insulinoma in cats reported in the literature. All prior insulionomas reported were in older cats and were malignant in character, which is similar to the reports in the dog. This case is unique because of the apparent lack of local recurrence and development of metastatic disease, leading to the prolonged survival.

AB  - Knowledge of the functional morphology of equine cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs) shortly before ovulation is scarce. Therefore the aim of our studies was to characterize COCs matured in vivo by light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and immunohistochemistry (ICC). Pre-ovulatory COCs were obtained by ultrasound-guided transvaginal aspiration of pre-ovulatory follicles of 26 pony mares. The morphology of pre-ovulatory COCs was compared to that of immature COCs obtained by slicing of ovaries from the slaughterhouse. As shown by light microscopy and SEM, immature COCs possess numerous round, densely packed cumulus cells, which contact each other and possess merely single short processes. Contrary, in pre-ovulatory oocytes the cumulus cells are widely separated but send long cytoplasmic processes to the zona pellucida (ZP). All the cumulus cells are embedded in a huge amount of homogenous extracellular matrix. As shown by alcian blue staining and Periodic Acid Schiff Reaction (PAS) with and without amylase digestion, this matrix contains glycoproteins and acidic and sulphated glycosaminoglycans. In pre-ovulatory COCs both the oocyte and the cumulus cells produce glycosaminoglycans, whereas immature COCs are negative for alcian blue. Similarly, glycoproteins are synthesized in pre-ovulatory, but not in immature COCs. As shown by ICC, hyaluronic acid is one of the most abundant mucopolysaccharide in the pre-ovulatory COC. The high synthetic activity of the cumulus cells in the pre-ovulatory COC is confirmed by TEM showing densely packed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and accumulation of glycogen in the cumulus cells. Our results imply that in the equine in vitro maturation of the oocyte is characterized by the cumulus cells synthesizing an extracellular matrix of glycoproteins and acidic and sulphated glycosaminoglycans. The extensive production of extracellular, water-binding matrix in the pre-ovulatory COC ensures mechanical protection and nutrition of the oocyte.

AB  - Summary Orthobiologics have emerged as new treatment options in human and animal athletes. Musculoskeletal disorders such as tendinopathies, desmopathies, and osteoarthritis are common in competition and working dogs because of stresses induced by their repetitive activities. Several therapies, such as anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, shockwave therapy, and surgery have been used to treat these disorders, but variable levels of evidence and success have been reported. Tendon and ligament healing potential is limited, especially in chronic injuries, which are commonly seen in athletes. Therefore, novel regenerative treatment approaches are of great interest in sports medicine. There are two goals of this chapter. First, the definitions and proposed mechanisms of action for different orthobiologics are reviewed; second, the clinical applications and the evidence for efficacy of these novel treatments are discussed. The chapter focuses on two major topics. Platelet-rich plasma is reviewed in detail, as this is the most commonly used orthobiologic in veterinary medicine. Stem cell applications are also presented, focusing on musculoskeletal and spinal injuries. The chapter is not intended to provide a thorough review of the literature on these topics, but aims to introduce the sports medicine and rehabilitation therapist to the growing area of regenerative medicine.

AB  - Summary.? Twenty years after its first use in the diagnostic workup of suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE), fibrin D-dimer (DD) testing has gained wide acceptance for ruling out this disease. The test is particularly useful in the outpatient population referred to the emergency department because of suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), in which the ruling out capacity concerns every third patient clinically suspected of having the disease. This usefulness is based on the high sensitivity of the test to the presence of VTE, at least for some assays. Due to its poor specificity precluding its use for ruling in VTE, DD testing must be integrated in comprehensive, sequential diagnostic strategies that include clinical probability assessment and imaging techniques such as lower limb venous compression ultrasonography for suspected DVT or multi-slice helical computed tomography for suspected PE. The present narrative review updates the data available on the use of the various commercially available DD assays in the diagnostic approach of clinically suspected VTE in distinct patient populations or situations, including outpatients and inpatients, patients with cancer, older age, pregnancy, a suspected recurrent event, limited thrombus burden, and patients already on anticoagulant treatment.

It focuses entirely on black bears and practitioners are encouraged to consult with brown bear and polar bears experts if working with these species. Bears may require veterinary and rehabilitation assistance for a variety of reasons. The most common causes of admission include orphaning, regulated and nonregulated hunting, weather events, vehicular collisions, dog interactions, and nuisance events. Trauma is a frequent finding on physical exam and surgical intervention is often required. Skin abrasions and lacerations, fractured bones, broken teeth, and damage to internal organs are common injuries in bears. As for any wild animal undergoing medical care or rehabilitation, established criteria should be met before contemplating release.

AB  - Summary Bandages and splints or casts are an essential component of wound management and, when used properly, can greatly aid healing. Improper application, however, may impede healing and be detrimental to the well-being or athletic future of the horse. Many different types of bandage materials exist and are reviewed in Chapter 6. This chapter is devoted to the principles and techniques of bandaging and casting. Splinting is discussed along with casting because either approach may be used when immobilization is required to support wound healing. Various techniques to improve the application and maintenance of bandages, splints, and casts, as well as to manage complications arising from their use, are discussed.

AB  - Abstract Objectives To report on the safety and efficacy of transvenous cardiac pacing wire insertion outside a tertiary hospital by a medical retrieval service. Methods SAAS MedSTAR Emergency Medical Retrieval Service transports symptomatic bradycardic patients in rural South Australia to Adelaide on transvenous pacing for ongoing management. This is a retrospective case review of all transvenous cardiac pacing wires inserted by SAAS MedSTAR between January 2015 and October 2017. Results This study demonstrated successful insertion of cardiac transvenous pacing wires and cardiac capture in 10 of 11 cases (91%) by pre-hospital and retrieval doctors. There were no immediate or long-term complications from insertion. All of the patients were successfully transferred by helicopter or fixed wing to their receiving facility, with nine of the 11 patients (82%) surviving to hospital discharge. Conclusion This paper demonstrates that transvenous cardiac pacing can be safely and successfully implemented for symptomatic patients by pre-hospital and retrieval physicians in the aeromedical retrieval setting.

AB  - This paper reviews the management of head injuries arising in the rural and remote areas of Queensland. Methodology? Data was obtained from the Queensland Trauma Registry from January 2003 to December 2004, a total of 3,088 patients, 1667 classified as major injury. Queensland is the second largest state in Australia with most of the 4 million population living along the eastern seaboard, mainly in the southeast corner and a widely dispersed rural population in small towns. There are neurosurgical services in Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Townsville. Results? Forty percent of patients are referred from another hospital for definitive care with transfer times of up to 10 hours between the referring and definitive care hospital. Of those requiring craniotomy 60% of patients are referred from a another hospital again with lengthy transfer times well beyond the 2 hour transfer time for the deteriorating head injury with intracranial haemorrhage as recommended in the NSA/RACS set of guidelines for the ?Management of Acute Neurotrauma in Rural and Remote Locations?. This paper reviews the problems which include deficient retrieval resources, a reluctance by non-neurosurgeons to perform emergency neurosurgery, a lack of training amongst younger surgeons, and perceived medicolegal issues. The paper also compares the situation in other states and territories. Conclusions? Recommendations are made to improve the delivery of neurotrama care.

AB  - Summary In adults diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), challenges remain in the management of the acute event whilst remaining alert to long-term morbidity. The addition of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) to the pharmacopoeia represents the first of a number of recent advancements in the management of DVT. Worldwide, uptake of these agents has been avid, although drug selection, reversal and chronic treatment effects continue to be controversial areas. Multi-centre studies to evaluate the impact of NOACs on long-term outcomes, including thrombosis recurrence and post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), are ongoing. Validation of tools capable of predicting PTS would enable patient selection for early aggressive intervention, such as local thrombolysis. Such interventional strategies are gaining momentum as initial approaches and would benefit from large randomized controlled trials.
