AB  - Objective To evaluate C-reactive protein at presentation and during hospitalisation in dogs with acute kidney injury resulting from leptospirosis to compare C-reactive protein at presentation in dogs with acute kidney injury of different aetiology and to study its correlation with markers of inflammation, azotaemia and survival. Materials and Methods Prospective observational study of 41 dogs with acute kidney injury secondary to leptospirosis and 15 control dogs with acute kidney injury of different aetiology. C-reactive protein was measured at presentation in both groups and daily for 7 days in a subgroup of 28 dogs with leptospirosis. The associations of C-reactive protein with neutrophil count, albumin, urea, creatinine and survival were analysed. Results C-reactive protein was increased at presentation in all dogs with leptospirosis but was not significantly different from dogs with acute kidney injury of different cause. It was associated with markers of inflammation (neutrophil count, albumin) but not with azotaemia (creatinine, urea). It decreased gradually from presentation to day 4, with significantly lower concentrations in survivors than non-survivors. Initial C-reactive protein was only weakly associated with outcome, but its average concentration from presentation to day 2 was more strongly associated. Absolute and relative changes in C-reactive protein during hospitalisation and creatinine at presentation were not associated with survival. Clinical Significance Serial assessment of C-reactive protein may improve outcome prediction in dogs with leptospirosis compared with a single measurement at presentation or with markers of renal function.

AB  - Abstract Academic emergency medicine can benefit by broadening the way in which scholarship is defined to include teaching, integration of knowledge, application of knowledge to practical clinical problems and as discovery of new knowledge. A broad view of scholarship will help foster innovation and may lead to new areas of expertise. The creation of a scholarly environment in emergency medicine faces the continued challenge of an increasing clinical demand. The solution to this dilemma will likely require a mix of clinical staff physicians and academic faculty who are appreciated, nurtured and rewarded in different ways, for the unique contributions they make to the overall success of the academic program.

AB  - Introduction? The central focus of eyelid reconstruct is the reconstitution of a dynamic protective covering for the cornea. The key to successful eyelid reconstruction is to properly assess the size of the defect and to separate the complex defect down into component parts or subunits. Since eyelid tissues retract in the presence of discontinuity, the residual lid margin has to be distracted under normal tension in order to assess the true size of the defect. In surgical planning, one must also assess the amount and location of inner and outer lamellar tissue absent. The inner lamella represents the conjunctiva, the tarsal plate, and the tarsoligamentous sling. The primary function is to provide lining and support to the lid. The most important region to reconstruct the inner lamella, the conjunctiva in particular, is centrally over the cornea in the upper lid. The outer lamella is represented by the skin and orbicularis oculi muscle. In the upper lid, the outer lamella has functional importance by enabling the dynamic blink to protect the cornea and prevent exposure. Small reconstructions may be carried out as a single stage, larger ones may require more than one stage. The fundamental principle is to utilize the following techniques for defects of increasing complexity and/or size 1) primary closure, 2) adjacent tissue, 3) lid sharing, and 4) regional or distant flap. Methods/Technique? Depending on the size of the defect, direct closure may be possible. Upper lids with a defect of 1/3 or less of the horizontal length can be closed directly. The criteria for lower lid direct closure is 1/4 to 1/3 of the horizontal length. Closure under too much tension will cause mechanical ptosis in the upper lid and lid retraction in the lower lid due to the close line effect. A selective (upper or lower) canthotomy will provide an additional 3?4?mm of length through tissue recruitment. The next order of reconstruction is the semicircular Tenzel skin muscle flap. This option is for subtotal defects greater than 1/3. Depending on the design, this flap can be used for upper or lower lid defects. By recruiting lateral tissue, end-to-end closure of the wound is achieved centrally, while the original defect undergoes lateralization. The absence of lashes laterally is better tolerated than centrally. The next order of reconstruction involves lid sharing. Upper lid tissue used for lower lid reconstruction includes the Hughes flap which shares a part of the upper lid tarsal plate and conjunctiva. Total upper lid reconstruction uses the lower lid Cutler-Beard flap with ear cartilage to replace missing tarsal plate. Both the Hughes procedure and the Cutler Beard Bridge Flap are two-stage procedures that are divided 2 weeks after the initial lid sharing. The visual axis is obstructed for two weeks until the bridge is divided. The Hewes? flap is a single stage reconstruction lid sharing for lower lateral defects. It is based on the superior vascular arcade. Distant flaps such as the Tripier, Fricke, and forehead or glabelllar flaps are used for large defects when other options are not possible. Results? Over the past 12 years 218 eyelid reconstructions were performed. 75% were cancer related and 25% were trauma related. 50% were secondary reconstructions referred from other surgeons. The average age of the patients was 60 evenly distributed between males and females. 90% of the cancer related defects were created by a Moh?s surgeon. Upper lid defects represented 25%and lower lid defects represented 75%. The distribution of procedures used is as follows: 25% direct closure (selective canthotomy was often employed for direct closure), 40% Tenzel flap, 15% lid sharing flaps, 10% Hewes flaps, and 10% distant flaps. Mucosal grafts were required for secondary cases of the upper lid. 10% of patients required a revision surgery (other than planned bridge division). The most frequent complications were lid malposition, excess lateral orbital skin, and need for lacrimal reconstruction with DCR, Jones? tubes or Crawford tubes. Permanent corneal damage or rupture was prevented in all cases. Conclusion? Eyelid reconstruction simplified by breaking complex defects into their component parts. Algorithmic linkage of reconstructive method to shape and size of defect also assist with consistent successful results. Eyelid reconstruction balances the functional result of the reconstructve procedures as well as the aesthetic result in order to minimize morbidity.

AB  - In civilian trauma concerns about tourniquet-related problems has rendered tourniquets virtually obselete. The use of tourniquets in a battlefield setting however remains surrounded by controversy. Whilst many accept that if properly used, tourniquets can be life saving devices, opinion is divided regarding its role. Some surgeons have recommended abolition of the tourniquet, whist others advocate that every combat solder should be issued with a tourniquet as part of their personal equipment. The recent introduction of the self applied C-A-T tourniquet into the Australian Defence Force has re-ignited controversy as to the appropriate role of tourniquets in an operational setting. During Vietnam, Desert Storm and Somalia haemorrhage from extremity wounds was a leading cause of preventable combat deaths. Improvements in body armour and increased exposure to blast injury has resulted in a relative increase in limb injuries in recent operations. Experience in Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan particularly by Special Operations communities has led to a re-assessment of the efficacy of battlefield tourniquet systems. The C-A-T tourniquet has been widely used in Iraq and Afghanistan. No iatrogenic injury has been reported, even with tourniquet times up to 8 hours. This paper will discuss the history of tourniquet use in the military from its first introduction in 1674 to the most recent ADF doctrine (ADFP XXX). It will also present trial results from the UK and US and recommendations from the 2006 Advanced Technologies Applied to Combat Casualty Care Conference (ATACC). This paper will address the basis of current doctrine and provide a case for and against the use of tourniquets in an operational setting.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper reports an investigation into the accuracy and effectiveness of two (2) senior Australian radiographers in the reporting of appendicular musculo-skeletal radiographs in the adult trauma situation. and discusses the international debate on radiographer role extension into plain film reporting. The study of 540 patients referred to a large metropolitan emergency imaging department demonstrated high rates of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity = 98.00% specificity = 99.11%) in the assessment of appendicular musculo-skeletal radiographs. 294 out of 300 positive examinations were identified correctly (FPR=0.88%) as were 225 out of 227 negative or normal examinations (FNR=2.00%). A discussion on relevant statistical measures and their definitions is outlined. In the study radiologist reports are used as the comparative gold standard. The findings demonstrate an ability of clinically experienced radiographers to accurately and effectively provide diagnostic opinions on musculoskeletal radiographs. A formalised approach to radiographer reporting can be justified and a formal program to train appropriately experienced radiographers is recommended.

AB  - Introduction:? The formation of the liver structure at mammal embryogenesis is interconnected by drawing up of venous mains. In parallel to the transformation of the main veins, there is a reduction of the blood formation function and the liver transformation from the primary organ of embryogenesis into the secondary one, but the exception is immaturity and underdeveloped maturity mammals (Smirnova, 1967; Mechtiev, 1968; Bresler, 1993). The purpose of research is to establish morphofunctional criteria of the incompleteness in the blood vessels and in tissue components of the liver in neonatal animals. Material and Methods:? The afferent and efferent liver veins of calves, piglets and puppies at one day of age were investigated. The complex of morphological, roentgenological, ultrasound and statistic methods was used. Results:? It was established that the liver veins in newborn animals portoumbilical (afferent) and caval (efferent) collectors. In 1-day-old calves, the afferent collector is connected with caval way of the large vein flow of the main type. Relative weight of the liver in the calves is 2.31?2.85%, hepatocytes form balks and they are not always oriented radially to the central venuels. There are no seats of haemopoesis. Sonography of the liver and its veins proves inconstancy of the sizes depending on acts of breath. In 1-day-old piglets, many treelike anastomoses follow with the left hepatic vein. Relative weight of the liver in the piglets is 2.27?4.64%. The parenchyma of the organ is spongy with the seats of haemopoesis (0.04 3.61%). In 1-day-old puppies afferent and efferent collectors combine through the venous duct. Additionally, in the abdominal cavity of puppies, there are the vitelline artery (starts from a. mesenterica) and vein (runs to v. porta near the afferent collector), following to the umbilical ring. Relative weight of the liver in the puppies is about 5.18?6.04%. Hepatocytes form the chaotic congestion with haemopoetic points (2.04?7.14%). Conclusion:? Thus, incompleteness of morphology of the liver is shown in preservation of provisional vein structures and tissue components of the embryonic type, which is one of the factors complicating diseases of digestive organs in neonatal animals.

AB  - Objective. The purpose of this study was to estimate the Down syndrome detection and false-positive rates for second-trimester sonographic prenasal thickness (PT) measurement alone and in combination with other markers. Methods. Multivariate log Gaussian modeling was performed using numerical integration. Parameters for the PT distribution, in multiples of the normal gestation-specific median (MoM), were derived from 105 Down syndrome and 1385 unaffected pregnancies scanned at 14 to 27 weeks. The data included a new series of 25 cases and 535 controls combined with 4 previously published series. The means were estimated by the median and the SDs by the 10th to 90th range divided by 2.563. Parameters for other markers were obtained from the literature. Results. A log Gaussian model fitted the distribution of PT values well in Down syndrome and unaffected pregnancies. The distribution parameters were as follows: Down syndrome, mean, 1.334 MoM; log10 SD, 0.0772; unaffected pregnancies, 0.995 and 0.0752, respectively. The model-predicted detection rates for 1%, 3%, and 5% false-positive rates for PT alone were 35%, 51%, and 60%, respectively. The addition of PT to a 4?serum marker protocol increased detection by 14% to 18% compared with serum alone. The simultaneous sonographic measurement of PT and nasal bone length increased detection by 19% to 26%, and with a third sonographic marker, nuchal skin fold, performance was comparable with first-trimester protocols. Conclusions. Second-trimester screening with sonographic PT and serum markers is predicted to have a high detection rate, and further sonographic markers could perform comparably with first-trimester screening protocols.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To evaluate the isoflurane sparing effect and the post-surgical analgesia provided by a brachial plexus block (BPB) in cats undergoing distal thoracic limb surgery. Study design? Prospective randomized blinded clinical study. Animals? Twenty client-owned cats. Methods? Cats were assigned to receive either no BPB (group NB) or a nerve stimulator guided BPB (group BPB) using lidocaine (3.6?mg?kg?1) and bupivacaine (1.2?mg?kg?1). Pre-medication consisted of midazolam and ketamine intravenously (IV). Anaesthesia was induced with propofol IV to effect and maintained with isoflurane delivered in oxygen and a continuous rate infusion of fentanyl (2??g?kg?1?hour?1). End-tidal isoflurane concentration (Fe?ISO) was adjusted every 3?minutes guided by changes in cardiorespiratory parameters and reflexes present, to maintain a stable depth of anaesthesia. Five time points were chosen to record all parameters and compare values between groups. Recovery and post-operative pain assessment were performed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) at 15 and 45?minutes after extubation and thereafter at hourly intervals until 5?hours after placement of the BPB. Results? No clinically significant differences were seen for heart rate, respiratory rate and non-invasive blood pressure between groups. Mean Fe?ISO was significantly lower in group BPB compared with group NB at all time points. In group NB, all intraoperative measurements of Fe?ISO were significantly higher compared with baseline (3?minutes before start of surgery) measurements. During recovery, VAS scores for group BPB were significantly lower than for group NB. Additional analgesics were needed in all cats within the study period. Conclusion and Clinical relevance? In cats undergoing orthopaedic surgery of the thoracic limb, BPB reduced intra-operative isoflurane requirement and pain during the early post-operative period when compared with procedures without a BPB. BPB is a useful adjunct to anaesthesia in such cases.

AB  - Summary Quantitative neuroimaging techniques have become emerging technologies within clinical practice. In this paper, we survey a few clinical applications where quantification methods have received increasing attention, namely in the area of brain atrophy, lesion load computation and quantification of diffusion processes. We focus on the reliability and reproducibility of such methods and will use the example of quantitative diffusion tensor imaging to discuss methodological details. There, we show possible avenues for evaluating correctness and reliability. On the one hand, we show results from our novel hardware phantom experiments, where axonal fibres are emulated by synthetic industry fibres. On the other hand, we present a new framework for constructing software phantoms which can be used to evaluate, for example, the impact of partial volume effects in case of axonal loss as to be found in multiple sclerosis. Advantages and disadvantages as well as pitfalls of quantification and evaluation techniques are illustrated throughout the paper.

AB  - Summary As survival rates from deep venous thrombosis (DVT) have improved dramatically with the introduction of anticoagulant medication, interest has developed in the long-term sequelae of DVT, namely the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Patients often present with lower limb swelling, aching and even venous claudication, six months to two years after having an episode of DVT. Patients with moderate PTS have quality of life scores which are worse than those for patients suffering from chronic lung disease or arthritis, and patients with severe PTS patients have scores similar to patients suffering from congestive heart failure or cancer. The diagnosis of PTS is a clinical one, with investigation used for characterisation of the lesion and detection of reflux, and also to aide with planning treatment. The CEAP classification (Clinical, Aetiology, Anatomy and Pathophysiology) is useful as a research tool to grade the pattern of disease in chronic venous disease patients.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents a case study of 80-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department (ED) with altered mental status. It discusses the acute coronary syndrome (ACS), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary embolism. Dyspnea accompanied by diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, or syncope describes the geriatric patient who may be presenting with ACS. Geriatric patients presenting with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs) demonstrate improved outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus fibrinolytic treatment. The diagnosis of CHF in elderly patients presenting with dyspnea is often delayed due to atypical symptoms and multiple comorbidities. Beta-blockers are very effective for management of CHF in elderly patients, they are contraindicated in the presence of comorbid pulmonary disease and can cause symptomatic bradycardias and atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction disorders. Rapid and aggressive therapy must be tempered by patient and family wishes regarding end-of-life care.

AB  - Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is characterised by extreme pain and dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system in one region of the body, usually an extremity.(1) It involves the somatosensory, sympathetic and the somato-motor systems. It consists of local neurogenic inflammation out of proportion to injury; severe pain in the skin, subcutaneous tissues and joints; and central hyperexcitability that is often compounded with a sympathetic component. It is multifaceted manifesting both central and peripheral neurologic pathophysiology, including a prominent psychosocial component. Mechanisms include trauma related cytokine release, exaggerated neurogenic inflammation, sympathetic afferent coupling, adrenoreceptor pathology, glial cell activation and cortical reorganisation.(2) Diagnostic criteria and tests used will be discussed. Biomedical interventions include the use of primary and secondary analgesics, neural blockade, sympatholysis, ketamine, bisphosphonates, and spinal cord/peripheral nerve stimulation. Psychological and behavioural factors can exacerbate the pain and dysfunction associated with CRPS.(3) Mirror visual feedback was introduced recently for rehabilitation but needs to be evaluated in randomized controlled trials.(4)
