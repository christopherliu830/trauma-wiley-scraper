AB  - Summary The parathyroid glands in dogs and cats are tan-colored ovoid structures closely associated with each thyroid gland. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) release is controlled by calcium receptors on the chief cells in the parathyroid glands in response to hypocalcemia. PTH has a short half-life (3?5 min) in serum and so a steady rate of secretion is necessary to maintain serum PTH concentrations. Natural variations in PTH concentration occur in healthy dogs. Exploratory surgery with parathyroidectomy in dogs with primary hyperparathyroidism serves as both a diagnostic test and definitive therapy. Surgery should be advocated to reduce the risk of urolithiasis and urinary tract infection, as well as improving the clinical signs seen with hypercalcemia such as polydipsia, polyuria, weakness, and decreased appetite. Surgical excision alone is the most widely performed treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism and a cure rate of 94% is reported if all autonomously functioning parathyroid tissue is removed.

AB  - Abstract Objective The objectives were to critically appraise the medical education research literature of 2015 and review the highest-quality quantitative and qualitative examples. Methods A total of 434 emergency medicine (EM)-related articles were discovered upon a search of ERIC, PsychINFO, PubMED, and SCOPUS. These were both quantitative and qualitative in nature. All were screened by two of the authors using previously published exclusion criteria, and the remaining were appraised by all authors using a previously published scoring system. The highest scoring articles were then reviewed. Results Sixty-one manuscripts were scored, and 10 quantitative and two qualitative papers were the highest scoring and are reviewed and summarized in this article. Conclusions This installment in this critical appraisal series reviews 12 of the highest-quality EM-related medical education research manuscripts published in 2015.

AB  - Uterine disease is a common cause of infertility and thus economic loss in dairy herds, yet in many herds the true incidence of disease is unknown. Accurate monitoring, identification and recording are essential to highlight when the incidence of uterine disease is too high and intervention is required. While prevention is always preferable to cure, when cases of uterine disease do occur it is important that they are treated and managed correctly to reduce any further impact on subsequent performance. This clinical forum will review the different presentations of uterine disease and seek the opinions of an expert panel on their approach to its management, monitoring and investigation.

AB  - Summary Spontaneous spinal epidural haematoma (SSEH) is rare, especially in pregnancy, and may lead to permanent neurological damage. Presentation varies from altered sensation to paralysis depending on the location and severity of the haematoma. A multi-disciplinary approach is essential for effective management of such cases. A 39-week primigravida presented to a district general hospital with an acute cervical neurological deficit. She was transferred to a specialist centre for urgent magnetic resonance imaging followed by sequential caesarean section and cervical epidural haematoma evacuation. The combined procedures were uneventful with a healthy baby delivered and recovering maternal neurology. Co-ordinating multiple specialties from geographically separate sites created a number of peri-operative challenges.

AB  - Summary Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a disease predominantly of the developed world, which remains a major public health problem despite screening and preventive strategies. Surgery remains the mainstay of CRC treatment and cure, which is complicated by the location (a narrow bony pelvis) and proximity to the sphincter mechanism, increasing the difficulty of surgical access and risk of a permanent colostomy. Screening programmes have reduced mortality by removing precursor and early lesions, but morbidity and mortality remain high for advanced cases. Identification of inherited colorectal cancer is important. Diagnostic requirements include clinical assessment and imaging (CT, MRI, ultrasound), laboratory tests and tumour markers (carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA]). Accurate preoperative staging is vital to enable risk-adapted optimal local and systemic management. Early rectal cancers are amenable to local excision. Total mesorectal excision (TME) achieves low rates of local recurrence (<10%) in Stage II and III rectal cancer. More locally-advanced cancers require neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by radical resection. Adjuvant chemotherapy post surgery for rectal cancer is more controversial than in colon cancer. We describe risk factors, presentation, recommended diagnostic procedures and treatment of patients with cancers of the colon and rectum.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare the outcomes of dogs treated at a single institution for single extrahepatic congenital portosystemic shunts (CPSS) by thin film banding (TFB) or by placement of an ameroid constrictor (AC). Study design Retrospective case series. Animals Seventy-six client-owned dogs with CPSS treated with TFB (n = 53) or AC (n = 23). Methods Records were reviewed for signalment, preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative management and short-term outcomes. Data on second surgeries were reviewed. Long-term outcomes were obtained via an owner-directed health-related quality of life questionnaire. The rates of complications, mortality, and revision surgery were compared between the treatment groups. Results Postoperative complications occurred in 15 (28%) dogs with TFB (9% mortality, n = 5) and 8 (35%) dogs with an AC (4% mortality, n = 1). Long-term follow-up was available in 41 of 56 dogs at a median of 55?months (range, 15-89). Revision surgery for persistent shunting was performed in 14 (29%) dogs treated initially with TFB and in no dogs treated initially with AC (P = .007). Median long-term outcome scores were good in both groups; nine of 14 revision surgeries led to favorable outcomes. Conclusion Persistent shunting requiring revision surgery was more common when CPSS were treated with TFB than with an AC, but both treatments achieved favorable long-term outcomes. Clinical significance Treatment of CPPS by placement of an AC rather than TFB seems more reliable for shunt attenuation and prevention of revision surgeries.

AB  - People have obligations to ensure the welfare of animals under their care. Offences under the UK Animal Welfare Act are acts, or failures of action, causing unnecessary suffering. Veterinary professionals need to be able to provide current, scientifically based prophylactic advice, and respect the limits of their expertise. The ethical concept of a life worth living and the Five Freedoms are core to welfare. Behaviour is a central component, both influencing and influenced by physical health. Owners frequently misunderstand the behaviour of small prey mammals and how to meet their needs. This review provides insight into the physical-social (external) and the cognitive-emotional (internal) environments of small prey mammals, contextualised within an evolutionary perspective. This is extrapolated to captivity and practical suggestions given for meeting behavioural freedoms and enhancing client understanding and enjoyment of their animals, thereby improving welfare.

AB  - Objectives To report the clinical presentation, treatment and prognosis of dogs with low-grade gastrointestinal lymphoma. Materials and Methods Cases were solicited from the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine Oncology Diplomate listserv. Medical records of dogs with low-grade gastrointestinal lymphoma diagnosed via a combination of histology and immunohistochemistry with or without analysis of polymerase chain reaction for antigen receptor rearrangement were included. Signalment, clinical signs, diagnostic test results, chemotherapy protocol, response to treatment, date of first progression, rescue therapies and date and cause of death or last follow-up visit were collected. Results Twenty cases were included. Males and small breed dogs were over-represented. Frequent clinical signs included weight loss, vomiting and diarrhoea. Most lymphomas were T-cell phenotype (95%), and epitheliotropism was commonly described (60%). Immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction for antigen receptor rearrangement or both were frequently required for definitive diagnosis. Two dogs had resection of an intestinal mass, and all dogs were treated with chemotherapy; chlorambucil and prednisone were most commonly prescribed. Overall response rate was 70%, and median survival time was 424?days (95% confidence interval: 105 to 1206?days). Clinical Significance Low-grade gastrointestinal lymphoma appears to be a rare condition in dogs, and treatment with chemotherapy results in a high response rate and favourable survival times. Further study is needed to determine its prevalence in dogs with chronic enteropathies.

AB  - Abstract Background. Increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is detrimental for the recovery of organ function in trauma and emergency patients. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between the dynamics of IAP and organ dysfunction in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). Materials and methods. Management of SAP between 2000 and 2004 was analysed. SAP was classified according to Atlanta 1992. Organ dysfunction, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and outcomes in relation to the IAP were assessed. IAP was measured indirectly. Results. A total of 65 patients, with an average APACHE II score of 6.44, complied with the Atlanta criteria. In all, 34 patients received conservative treatment and 31 were operated. SIRS was observed in 59 cases and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in 61 cases. IAP was significantly higher in the 25 most complicated patients requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), compared with 40 patients without RRT, 31.72 vs 21.4 cm/H2O (p=0.037). IAP interrelated positively with SOFA score (r =+ 0.371, p<0.01) and organs involved (r =+ 0.356, p<0.01), and negatively with platelet count and enterally provided volume (r =? 0.284, p<0.01; r =? 0.5, p<0.01, respectively). Overall mortality (9.2%) was associated with surgery and sustained increase of the IAP over 25 cm/H2O. Our data support the pathophysiological interrelation of elevated IAP and development of organ dysfunction. Conclusion. Development of organ dysfunction in SAP could be associated with increased IAP. Grade III increase of IAP should be considered as an indicator for revision of treatment modalities.

AB  - Summary Minimally invasive surgery modalities are associated with decreased morbidity when compared with open reconstructive techniques. Therefore, minimally invasive surgery has an expanding role in the management of ureteric reconstruction. Management of various ureteral pathologies requiring reconstruction of the ureter by pure laparoscopy is technically demanding and requires efficiency with intracorporeal suturing. Robotics solves many of the technical complexities that may be prohibitive with standard laparoscopic surgery since suturing is made easier for the inexperienced. However, continued study of cost-effectiveness is necessary to define the optimal role for robotic reconstruction in both medical and economic terms. The entire range of ureteral reconstructive procedures has been performed by either conventional or robot-assisted laparoscopy. Despite low volume of upper tract reconstruction performed in adults compared to other laparoscopic cases, many studies demonstrate equivalent or superior outcomes in comparison to traditional open techniques.

AB  - Summary The peritoneum covers all walls of the abdominal cavity and all viscera within the abdominal cavity. Peritonitis, or inflammation of the peritoneum, may be classified as primary or secondary, localized or generalized, and aseptic or septic. Secondary generalized septic (bacterial) peritonitis is the most common form of peritonitis in small animals. Abdominal radiography and ultrasonography are useful diagnostic tools in cases of suspected peritonitis. Dogs and cats with septic peritonitis present with historical and physical examination findings similar to patients with acute abdominal disease of other causes. Many of the same challenges in the care of patients with septic peritonitis occur preoperatively and postoperatively, including hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, and altered coagulation. Surgery should be performed as soon as adequate efforts have been made to stabilize the patient's cardiovascular status and fluid balance. Principles of surgical therapy for septic peritonitis include source control, peritoneal lavage, and peritoneal drainage.

AB  - Summary Pyothorax is the accumulation of exudate within the thoracic cavity. Species of bacteria most commonly associated with pyothorax differ in cats versus dogs. In cats, Pasteurella spp. is by far the predominant species cultured; in dogs, a wider variety of bacteria have been associated with the condition, mainly obligate anaerobes or a mixture of obligate anaerobes with facultative aerobic bacteria. The average age at presentation is between 4 and 5 years for cases of canine and feline pyothorax, although it may occur in all age groups. The most common hematologic and biochemical findings in canine and feline pyothorax are anemia, neutrophilic leucocytosis with a left shift, and hypoalbuminemia. Treatment of pyothorax in cats and dogs can be broadly divided into medical and surgical treatments. Primary medical management using thoracostomy tubes and antimicrobials with or without lavage is still used in the majority of cases successfully.

AB  - Clinicians should possess current knowledge about the prognosis and expected outcome of endodontic treatment, including apical surgery. This knowledge cannot be acquired by indiscriminate review of the many available studies because they vary in the level of evidence they provide. Therefore, seven studies that best comply with methodology criteria defining the levels of evidence were selected and used as the basis of this review. In spite of their methodological consistency, the outcomes reported in these studies still differ considerably, mainly because of differences in inclusion criteria. According to these studies, 37?91% of teeth can be expected to be healed, while up to 33% can still be healing several years after surgery. Importantly, 80?94% of teeth can remain in symptom-free function, even if they are not healed. Several pre-operative factors may influence the outcome of treatment; the outcome may be better in teeth with small lesions and excessively short or long root canal fillings, and it may be poorer in teeth treated surgically for the second time. With regard to intra-operative factors, the choice of the root-end filling material and the quality of the root-end filling may influence the outcome, while the retrograde retreatment procedure clearly offers a better outcome than the standard root-end filling. In summary, the expected outcome of apical surgery is good and therefore, before considering tooth extraction and replacement, apical surgery should be attempted when it is feasible.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare short-term postoperative mortality in dogs after splenectomy performed with or without a bipolar vessel sealing device (BVSD) and to identify variables associated with mortality. Study design Retrospective study. Sample population Client-owned dogs (n = 203). Methods Medical records of dogs that underwent splenectomy from 2005-2018 were reviewed. Mortality rates were compared between dogs that underwent splenectomy with or without BVSD. Causes of death and variables associated with short-term mortality were assessed. Results Fifteen of 203 (7.4%) dogs died prior to discharge, and seven (3.4%) dogs died prior to suture removal for a total short-term mortality rate of 22 of 203 (10.8%). The estimated difference in proportion of deaths prior to discharge between the BVSD and non-BVSD groups was ?0.01 (95% confidence interval = ?0.08 to 0.06). Duration of anesthesia was longer when splenectomy was performed without BVSD (median 168 vs 152?minutes; P = .03). Multivariate analysis identified intraoperative (odds ratio [OR] 5.7) or postoperative (OR 13.6) administration of blood products, increasing duration of anesthesia (OR 1.15 per additional 16?minutes), and intraoperative ventricular arrhythmias (OR 6.8) as significantly associated with death prior to discharge. Intraoperative (OR 3.2) or postoperative (OR 7.7) administration of blood products was associated with death prior to suture removal. Conclusion Use of a BVSD did not appear to increase short-term mortality after splenectomy. Clinical significance Dogs undergoing splenectomy that require intraoperative or postoperative transfusions, experience intraoperative ventricular arrhythmias, or have prolonged anesthesia may be at risk for death in the short-term postoperative period.

AB  - ABSTRACT BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The hematoma volume is an important determinant of outcome and a predictor of clinical deterioration in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Our goal was to evaluate alterations in the cerebral circulation, in respect to hemorrhage and edema volume changes, using transcranial Doppler (TCD). METHODS Twenty patients with acute supratentorial ICH were examined. Brain, hematoma, and edema volumes were calculated from CT scans performed at admission and 2 weeks later. Data were compared with those obtained from bilateral TCD recordings of the middle cerebral arteries. RESULTS During TCD examination, blood flow velocities did not change, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and resistance area product (RAP) decreased (P = .006, P = .002) while cerebral blood flow index (CBFI) remained constant on the affected side. Although hemorrhage volume did not correlate with RAP in the acute phase, correlation was found in the subacute phase (r = ?.44, P = .04). CONCLUSIONS TCD monitoring sensitively demonstrates the hemodynamic change caused by ICH but the severity of the changes does not correlate with the volume of the ICH in acute stage. The CPP, RAP, and CBFI values are more sensitive parameters than the absolute velocity values, therefore they contribute more to the understanding of hemodynamic changes developed after spontaneous ICH.

AB  - Summary Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is characterized by an acute onset of severe headache and multi-focal segmental vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries resolving within 12 weeks. Diagnostic criteria include normal or near-normal findings in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, especially leucocyte levels < 10/mm?. Distinguishing RCVS from primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) is essential to avoid unnecessary and sometimes unfavourable immunosuppressive treatment. We reviewed retrospectively the clinical and diagnostic data of 10 RCVS patients who presented in our neurological department from 1 January 2013 to February 2017. The main purpose was to verify whether CSF leucocyte counts < 10/mm? serve to discriminate RCVS from PACNS. Five of six patients who underwent lumbar puncture presented with CSF leucocyte levels ≥ 10/mm?. Two patients had a history of misinterpretation of CSF pleocytosis as cerebral vasculitis and of immunosuppressive treatment. A complete restitution of cerebral vasoconstriction was evident in all. No patient had further cerebral strokes or bleedings without immunosuppressive treatment over more than 12 weeks. Despite the established diagnostic criteria, RCVS can manifest with CSF leucocyte levels > 10/mm?. Careful anamnesis and the response of ?vasculitis-like angiography? to nimodipine given as a test during angiography and as oral medication are key to differentiate RCVS from cerebral vasculitis.

AB  - Summary Ureteral stent placement for the management of malignant ureteral obstructions has been a mainstay of palliative treatment for humans with non-resectable tumors to preserve renal function. Ureteral stents have also been placed preoperatively for patient stabilization prior to surgical intervention. Urothelial neoplasia in dogs is often complicated by local tumor invasion and obstruction of the urethra, ureters, or both. Nephrostomy tube placement or hemodialysis can provide temporary relief, but radical surgeries have traditionally been the only viable alternative for long-term management in veterinary patients. This chapter describes the placement of a double pigtail ureteral stent as a minimally invasive, long-term treatment option for malignant obstructive neoplasia in dogs and cats. The author has also used this technique in a small number of feline patients with malignant obstructions, though the subcutaneous ureteral bypass (SUB) device is generally preferred in cats.
