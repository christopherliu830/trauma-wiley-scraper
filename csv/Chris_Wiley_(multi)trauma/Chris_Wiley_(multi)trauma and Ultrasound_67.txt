AB  - Summary It has become increasingly obvious that factors such as communication, teamwork, and leadership have significant roles in patient safety. In healthcare, when communication breaks down patient safety is jeopardized, a reality that has been documented in a number of clinical settings, including general medicine, emergency departments, and surgery. Teamwork is the array of interconnected behaviors, cognitive processes, and attitudes that make coordinated and adaptive performance possible in complex environments such as clinical settings. This chapter provides some examples of breakdowns in communication within the context of veterinary anesthesia. Every method of communication is prone to error. Oral communications are often only partially recalled by the receiver. Written communications are time consuming so are often only partially completed. Electronic communications are often too brief. Forms should be backed up with verbal communications and vice versa. Standardizing communication and communication training should be encouraged.

AB  - Abstract Patients presenting with swelling arising from the floor of the mouth (FOM) should be examined prudently, with the aid of appropriate diagnostic modalities such as ultrasonography, ultrasound guided aspirational biopsy, CT with contrast or MRI. Clinicians should include even the rare occurrences, like lipomas, especially while categorising intra-oral lesions because this can impede appropriate surgical planning, which can consequently cause recurrence or even malignant transformation of the lesion. This case report presents a painless sublingual lipoma situated on the left side of the FOM. The size gradually increased and eventually interfered with the movement of tongue and swallowing that was initially attributed as either sublingual cyst (dermoid/epidermoid) or ranula. Although lipomas are considered to originate at any site in the body, their incidence in the oral cavity is rare (1%?4%). In the present case, a sublingual lipoma presented as a painless and slow-growing swelling located on the left side of FOM associated with restricted tongue movement. Complete resection of the lesion was performed with the preservation of Wharton?s duct, lingual nerve and hypoglossal nerve. Post-operative recovery was uneventful and subsequent follow-up was satisfactory showing no sign of wound dehiscence or infection. The salivary flow was normal in both Wharton?s ducts.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane for inhalant anesthesia in red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) in terms of the speed and characteristics of induction; cardiovascular and respiratory parameters while anesthetized; and speed and quality of recovery. Study design? Prospective, cross over, randomized experimental study. Animals? 12 healthy adult red-tailed hawks. Methods? Anesthesia was induced with isoflurane, sevoflurane or desflurane in oxygen via face mask in a crossover, randomized design with a 1?week washout period between each treatment. Hawks were tracheally intubated, allowed to breathe spontaneously, and instrumented for cardiopulmonary monitoring. Data collected included heart rate, respiratory rate, end-tidal CO2, inspired and expired agent, SpO2, temperature, systolic blood pressure, time to intubation and time to recovery (tracking). Recovery was subjectively scored on a 4 point scale as well as a summary evaluation, by a single blinded observer. Results? No significant difference in time to induction and time to extubation was noted with the administration of isoflurane, sevoflurane or desflurane. Time to the ability of the bird to follow a moving object with its eyes (tracking) was significantly faster with the administration of sevoflurane and desflurane. All recoveries were scored 1 or 2 and were assessed as good to excellent. No significant difference was noted in heart rate, blood pressure and temperature among the three inhalants. Administration of isoflurane resulted in lower respiratory rates. Conclusions and clinical relevance? Overall, although isoflurane remains the most common inhaled anesthetic in avian practice, sevoflurane and desflurane both offer faster time to tracking, while similar changes in cardiopulmonary function were observed with each agent during anesthesia of healthy red-tailed hawks.

AB  - Summary Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory response to pancreatic injury., The response can be mild and local, or extend to peripancreatic and systemic inflammation. The systemic inflammatory response can also lead to vascular leak, pulmonary edema, hypovolemia hypotension and shock, and ischemic injury to the pancreas, kidney and intestines. The most common etiologies of acute pancreatitis are gallstones, alcoholism, and idiopathic. Treatment is initially aimed at fluid resuscitation, support of organ dysfunction, and in severe cases enteral feeding. Therapeutic endoscopy may be needed to dislodge an impacted gallstone to treat bacterial cholangitis. Treatment is supportive, and a plan to prevent recurrence should be implemented before discharge.

AB  - The RMH is a large, tertiary teaching hospital that is now a designated level 1 trauma centre. Facilities include a helipad and upgraded Emergency Department and Operating Theatre areas. In many cases it is not possible to provide group specific and crossmatched Red Cell Concentrates (RCC) for individuals requiring urgent and lifesaving treatment. In this situation, scarce O Negative RCC must be used. Previously, the Blood Bank at the RMH issued blood and blood products to the Emergency Department in plastic bags or foam eskies. Once issued these RCC could not be returned to the hospital Blood Bank inventory, as the product transportation and storing conditions to and in the Emergency Department were uncontrolled. Baxter Healthcare ½ recently has made available an innovative and validated system of transport for blood and blood products. This ?Blood-In-Motion?(BiM) system consists of moulded plastic elements that are filled with a patented Phase Change Material (PCM). Following our adoption of the BiM we found it an easy to use, validated system for the safe temperature controlled transport of RCC in an emergency situation. We have further utilised the BiM system as a ?Massive Exsanguination Pack?(MEP) used in response to a time-critical call from Emergency. The MEP transports 4 units O Neg RCC, 4 units thawed AB FFP & 1 pool Rh Neg platelets. This BiM/MEP system allows the storage of RCC and plasma products under controlled temperature for up to 6 hours. This solution has enabled the RMH to conserve a scarce and valuable resource, and to supply emergency blood products in a timely and controlled manner.

AB  - The emergency department (ED) is at the front line of hospital pressure injury (PI) prevention, yet ED clinicians must balance many competing clinical priorities in the care of seriously ill patients. This paper presents the current biomechanical and clinical evidence and management considerations to assist EDs to continue to develop and implement evidence-based PI prevention protocols for the high-risk emergency/trauma patient. The prevention of hospital-acquired pressure injuries has received significant focus internationally over many years because of the additional burden that these injuries place on the patient, the additional costs and impact to the efficiency of the hospital, and the potential for litigation. The development of a PI is the result of a complex number of biomechanical, physiological, and environmental interactions. Our understanding of the interaction of these factors has improved significantly over the past 10 years. We have demonstrated that large reductions in PI incidence rates can be achieved in critical care and general hospital wards through the application of advanced evidence-based prevention protocols and believe that further improvement can be achieved through the application of these approaches in the ED.

AB  - The large bulk of lost craniofacial soft tissue is mainly adipose tissue. Current surgical approaches following tumor resection and trauma have limitations. Adipose derived-stromal cells (ADSCs), also named as preadipocytes, have been demonstrated to be a good cell candidate for adipose tissue engineering. However, characteristics of scaffold played important role in a successful tissue engineered adipose tissue. Objectives:? The present study is to investigate whether in vitro adipogenesis could be induced both in a monolayer and 3-D by ADSCs. Methods:? Healthy adult ADSCs were isolated by liposuction from fat pads. After discarding the unattached cells, the ADSCs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics until they reached confluence. After trypsinization, ADSCs were subcultured at a density of 105 cells/100?mm-dish as a first passage. The monolayer and 3-D adipogenesis were assessed after seeding 105 ADSCs into each well of 6-well plates and 5???106 ADSCs/ml into biodegradable collagen sponges, respectively, followed by replacement of basic medium with adipogenic one. Results:? In both monolayer and 3-D scaffolds, lipids containing adipocytes were observed 1 week after adipogenic stimulation, and further increased over the time. By contrast, no adipogenesis was observed in ADSCs cultured in basic medium. Conclusions:? Human adipose-derived stromal cells isolated from fat pads can readily be induced toward adipogenesis in vitro. The in vivo adipogenesis potential of ADSCs is being investigated.

AB  - Case A 65-year-old arteriopath with a history of myocardial infarction 5 months previously presented with classical signs of mesenteric infarction that led to a right hemicolectomy with an end ileostomy. Outcome Postoperative complications occurred due to unusually large volume ileostomy output in the subsequent 4 weeks, resulting in severe volume depletion and the sequelae that required intensive care support. These were triggered and prolonged by two episodes of intra-abdominal sepsis. Conclusions Sepsis-induced high ileostomy output following intestinal resection for non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia is a serious complication. Early restoration of intestinal continuity following bowel resection for established infarction may prevent this complication.

AB  - Objectives To determine whether doxorubicin?piroxicam combination is safe and has activity against transitional cell carcinoma in dogs. Methods Data was collected retrospectively from 34 dogs from two institutions over a 6-year period. Signalment, clinical presentation, treatment specifics, adverse events, response, progression-free survival and overall survival time were evaluated. Results Dogs received doxorubicin every 3 weeks and daily piroxicam; 17 dogs (50%) had surgery. Clinical presentations were those typically reported for transitional cell carcinoma. Mean number of doses administered was 3·5. Of the 23 dogs with measurable disease, 14 (60·5%) had stable disease, 7 (30·5%) had progressive disease and 2 (9%) a partial response. Adverse events were generally manageable, and gastrointestinal in origin; one dog died of treatment-related complications. Overall median progression-free survival and overall survival were 103 and 168 days, respectively. Cytoreductive surgery did not result in prolongation of progression-free survival, but significantly prolonged overall survival. All dogs but one died as a result of disease progression. Clinical Significance Doxorubicin?piroxicam combination therapy is well-tolerated in dogs with transitional cell carcinoma although progression-free survival, overall survival and biological response rates appear modest. Combination with surgery appears to offer a survival advantage; however, this may reflect tumour location and volume. Prospective studies are necessary to compare activity of combination doxorubicin?piroxicam to currently applied therapies.

AB  - Objective? To evaluate the effect of perioperative and operative variables on survival time in dogs with aortic body tumors. Study Design? Retrospective study. Sample Population? Twenty-four client-owned dogs with histologically confirmed aortic body tumor. Methods? Seventy-eight patient records of dogs seen at the University of Illinois Veterinary Teaching Hospital between 1989 and 1999 with a diagnosis of a heart-base mass were reviewed. Dogs without histologic conformation of an aortic body tumor were excluded. Age; sex; breed; the presence of pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or abdominal effusion; evidence of cardiac arrhythmias; evidence of distant metastasis; treatment with pericardectomy; treatment with chemotherapy; and time from diagnosis until euthanasia or death were recorded on a spreadsheet. Cox proportional-hazard ratios were used to calculate the relationship of risk variables to survival time. Median survival time was determined using life-table analysis. Results? Twenty-four dogs met the criteria for inclusion in the study. The median age of dogs with aortic body tumors was 9 years. All dogs had a surgical biopsy performed. Fourteen dogs had a pericardectomy at the time of the biopsy procedure. Of all factors analyzed, only treatment with pericardectomy had a significant influence on survival (P= .0029). Dogs that had pericardectomy survived longer (median survival, 730 days; range, 1?1,621 days) compared with dogs that did not have pericardectomy (median survival, 42 days; range, 1?180 days). This finding was independent of the presence or absence of pericardial effusion at the time of surgery. Clinical Relevance? Dogs that are diagnosed with aortic body tumors may benefit from a pericardectomy at the time of surgical biopsy.

With evolving surgical approaches for organ retrieval and implantation, it has become standard to procure the pancreas in conjunction with other abdominal organs without compromising either vasculature, graft quality, or transplant outcomes. This review summarizes the major steps required for proper whole-organ retrieval of the pancreas allograft with suggestions and tips whenever alternative approaches are available.

AB  - Summary This chapter describes minimally invasive treatments for thrombosis including a multimodality approach centered on interventional radiology, antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy, and thrombolytics. Thrombolytic drugs target the clot directly by accelerating fibrinolysis. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), streptokinase, and urokinase have been administered intravenously in cats and dogs with thrombosis with variable success. The chapter also talks about clinical signs, diagnostics, intervention, and long-term therapy of central venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, ischemia?reperfusion injury, and pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in dogs and cats. Treatment of venous thrombi must be based upon consideration of the overall clot burden and extent, the resulting clinical signs associated with the venous obstruction, and the ability to control the underlying cause of the clot if it is identified. Echocardiography is an easily accessible modality useful in confirming a thrombus in the proximal pulmonary artery. Angiography, contrast-enhanced CT and MRI are also useful modalities in confirming and locating the PTE.

AB  - Abstract A 5·5-year-old male castrated Bernese mountain dog presented with respiratory difficulties and was diagnosed with haemorrhagic pericardial effusion which transformed into chylopericardium. Thoracic duct ligation and subtotal pericardiectomy in combination with biopsy of an enlarged tracheobronchial lymph node were performed. Multiple clusters of mesothelial cell emboli were observed in the subcapsular sinus of the lymph node. No causative agent for the pericardial effusion could be identified, suggesting that this is a case of mesothelial cell embolisation associated with idiopathic -chylopericardium in a dog.

AB  - Abstract Until recently, evidence to support Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) closure for secondary prevention of recurrent stroke has been controversial. Publication of high-quality evidence from randomized clinical trials and the subsequent FDA approval of two devices for percutaneous PFO closure is expected to increase the volume of PFO closure procedures not only in the United States but worldwide. As this technology is disseminated broadly to the public, ensuring the safe and efficacious performance of PFO closure is essential to mitigate risk and avoid unnecessary procedures. This document, prepared by a multi-disciplinary writing group convened by the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions and including representatives from the American Academy of Neurology, makes recommendations for institutional infrastructure and individual skills necessary to initiate and maintain an active PFO/stroke program, with emphasis on shared decision making and patient-centered care.

AB  - A simple technique for autotransfusion has been developed and used in the successful resuscitation of dogs suffering severe trauma and /or hemorrhage. The purpose of this abstract is three-fold: 1) Describe the criteria used in case selection; 2) Describe the method used; and 3) Describe the results of its use in a limited number of cases. Case Selection: The criteria used were the following: 1. Ongoing significant hemorrhage or severe hemorrhage noted in a body cavity where the blood could be collected; 2. Acute hemorrhage amounts deemed to be life-threatening (>40% calculated blood volume [88?ml/kg]); 3. Where other choices (fresh or stored homologus blood, Oxyglobin) in amounts needed were not possible. Method: Blood was aspirated into a suction canister using a Pool or Yankauer suction tip, with the tip placed under the pool (s) of blood to eliminate as many bubbles in the collection process as possible. If the canister was not sterilized it was scrubbed with a surgical prep solution and then rinsed with tap water prior to blood collection. The blood in the canister was poured into a wide opening in a hanging empty plastic intravenous fluid bag with a blood administration set inserted. The blood was intravenously administered by gravity drip as needed. No attempt was made to use any anticoagulant. Amounts of blood given, clinical responses, and complications were recorded. Results: The procedure was used in 12 dogs: 5 abdominal hemorrhage, 3 thoracic hemorrhage, 2 hemorrhage from both abdomen and chest, 2 vertebral vein hemorrhage. All blood administered was given during the operation or within 2 hours. Amounts transfused ranged from 30 to 120?ml/kg (body weight [mean 48?ml/kg]). No animals died acutely from signs thought to be associated with the transfusion of this blood. Those cases surviving to discharge were 4 abdominal, 2 thoracic, 1 combined, and 1 vertebral vein. There were no infections attributed to the autotransfusion. It is concluded that this technique can be recommended and may be considered life-saving in selected cases.

AB  - Abstract We present a novel, likely autosomal recessive, multi-system disorder seen in three siblings, two males and one female, born to nonconsanguineous parents. The disease manifests as agammaglobulinemia with marked microcephaly, significant developmental delay, craniosynostosis, a severe dermatitis, cleft palate, narrowing of the choanae, and blepharophimosis. The constellation of clinical signs seen in this family likely represents a new and recognizable form of agammaglobulinemia due to a defect in early B-cell maturation. ? 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
