AB  - Summary Thirty-six Thoroughbred racehorses that died at California racetracks between October 1993 and July 1994 were evaluated for stress fractures in the caudal portion of the thoracic and lumbosacral regions of the spine and the pelvis. The lumbosacral spine and pelvis were collected, debrided of soft tissues and examined visually for the presence of an incomplete fracture line and focal periosteal proliferation, characteristic of a stress fracture. Sixty-one per cent of specimens had evidence of stress fracture in the caudal portion of the thoracic and lumbosacral regions of the spine and the pelvis. Vertebral lamina stress fractures were found in 50% of specimens and were positively associated with the severity of dorsal spinous process impingement and overall severity of articular process degenerative changes. Pelvic stress fractures affected 28% of specimens and occurred more frequently in older horses. Pelvic stress fractures were positively associated with the severity of lumbar transverse process impingement and several ilial articular surface degenerative changes. A high prevalence of vertebral and pelvic stress fractures was noted in this sample of Thoroughbred racehorses that died because of unrelated injuries. Vertebral and pelvic stress fractures need to be considered in the clinical evaluation of horses with back problems or hindlimb lameness. Undiagnosed stress fractures of the vertebrae or pelvis could be a significant cause of poor performance and lameness in Thoroughbred racehorses.

AB  - Summary At least 1 in 10 deaths in the older population are caused by infectious disease. The commonest infections are urinary tract infection, pneumonia and cellulitis. Susceptibility to infection increases due to changes in the immune system, exposure to pathogens in hospitals and care institutions, frailty and decreased physiological reserve. Infection often presents with a change in mental and functional status rather than typical signs of localised infection. Antibiotic stewardship is important in the older adult due to the risks of drug side effects and interactions, antibiotic resistance and Clostridium difficile infection. Particular features of this chapter include: Recognising atypical presentations of infection and sepsis in older people Investigations in the older person with a suspected urinary tract infection Differential diagnoses of cellulitis Indications to consider escalation of care

AB  - A 14-month-old, male German shepherd dog was evaluated for chronic, recurrent Escherichia coli urinary tract infection. An initial diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis was made, which resolved with appropriate antibacterial therapy. The urinary tract infection, however, did not resolve and on further investigation a bladder trigone diverticulum was evident, thought to be congenital in origin. This report describes the apparent ultrasonographic and radiological changes, and surgical repair of the diverticulum, and reviews the literature with regard to both congenital bladder trigone diverticulum and emphysematous cystitis. The former has never been documented in the dog and the latter is an unusual finding in a non-diabetic dog.

AB  - Summary Neuro-oncology covers both the scientific and clinical aspects of central nervous system (CNS) tumours and neurological complications of cancer. Improvements in radiological and histological diagnosis and surgical technique, advances in molecular neuro-oncology, the application of new biological agents and increasing use of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy for tumours such as gliomas have led to small but definite improvements in survival. This chapter provides a clinically dominated guide to the key issues in neuro-oncology. It reflects the highly specialised nature of disciplines within neuro-oncology. The chapter outlines the multi-disciplinary aspects of care on clinical management. Brain tumours include primary tumours arising from intracranial structures and metastases from outside the CNS. There are a number of other rarer tumours in childhood that often present with seizures and behave in a benign fashion. They are usually treated with surgery alone.

AB  - Abstract Studies on human patients and animal models of disease have shown that disruptions in prenatal and early postnatal brain development are a root cause of mental retardation. Since proper brain development is achieved by a strict spatiotemporal control of neurogenesis, cell migration, and patterning of synapses, abnormalities in one or more of these events during prenatal development can lead to cognitive dysfunction after birth. Many of underlying causes of mental retardation must therefore be studied in developing brains. To aid in this research, live imaging using laser scanning microscopy (LSM) has recently allowed neuroscientists to delve deeply into the complex three-dimensional environment of the living brain to record dynamic cellular events over time. This review will highlight recent examples of how LSM is being applied to elucidate both normal and abnormal cortical development. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc. MRDD Research Reviews 2005;11:303?316.

AB  - Feline obstructive ureteral disease will likely remain a common and frustrating cause of critical illness in cats for the foreseeable future. Since many cats are uraemic and cardiovascularly unstable secondary to obstructive nephropathy, prompt recognition using clinical intuition, blood work and diagnostic imaging is essential to make a timely diagnosis and decision about timing for intervention, if indicated. Multiple surgical and interventional procedures exist for the management of feline ureteral obstructions but there is no ideal technique and all currently available procedures carry risk of infection, re-obstruction, urine leakage and the need for additional procedures in the future. Therefore, until clear, evidence-based guideline exist, the decision about which ureteral procedure to perform in cats should be guided by nature of the obstruction, location, concurrent urolithiasis, infection and surgeon preference. In all likelihood, ureteral surgery, stents and ureteral bypass devices will continue to remain viable options and the decision about which procedure to use will be made on a case-by-case basis.

Anaesthesia was induced with midazolam and ketamine after sedation with xylazine and maintained with isoflurane. Anaesthesia was uneventful until cardiac arrest occurred in the early recovery period. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed with chest compressions and electrical defibrillation. During resuscitation palpebral reflexes and spontaneous breathing returned but ventricular fibrillation could not be converted to sinus rhythm by transthoracic defibrillation of the heart by electrical shock.

AB  - Abstract Chronic diabetic complications ? both microvascular and macrovascular ? have become serious health issues with their increasing prevalence paralleling the dramatic rise of the diabetic population worldwide. Of these complications, foot disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, consuming more health care resource than all other complications combined. Diabetic polyneuropathy and peripheral vascular disease constitute the two main risk factors, with trauma and foot infection being the most important initiating factors and contributors to delayed healing. Intracellular oxidative stress mediated by hyperglycaemia along with hypertension, dyslipidaemia and smoking constitute the main pathological processes in the aetiology of both macrovascular and microvascular disease. Whilst the former remains the major cause of overall mortality in diabetes, the role of microangiopathy in the pathogenesis of diabetes foot disease and its contribution to delayed wound healing in diabetes has yet to be fully understood and indeed continues to be debated. This article will review the key findings to date on structural and functional microvascular abnormalities in the diabetic foot skin and consider their contribution to impaired would healing.

AB  - Summary Objective? IGFs and IGF binding proteins in the circulation are subject to modulation by a number of catabolic states including inflammation, trauma and surgery. We sought to determine the impact of laparoscopy on the IGF system in patients diagnosed with acute cholecystitis. Design? The components of the IGF system, cortisol, glucose and insulin concentration in both the serum and urine of patients were compared to those from a healthy group of subjects. An additional comparison was made between pre- and post-laparoscopically assisted patients. Patients? Thirty patients diagnosed with acute cholecystitis and 81 matched controls were included in the study. Measurements? Radioimmunoassays were used to determine the IGF-I, IGF-II, insulin and cortisol concentrations. The concentration of IGFBP-3 was measured using an immunoradiometric assay. The GOD-PAP method was used to determine the glucose concentration. Gel filtration chromatography was performed to calculate the IGF binary/ternary complex ratio. The amount of sialic acid in IGFBP-3 was determined by affinity chromatography. The presence of IGFBPs in serum was determined by both immunoblotting and ligandblotting. Results? The concentrations of circulating IGF-I, IGF-II and IGFBP-3 were significantly reduced in pre-operative patients compared to healthy subjects. No further reductions were observed post-laparoscopy. Immunoblotting and ligandblotting demonstrated a decreased amount of IGFBP-3 in both pre- and post-operative patients compared to healthy subjects. Increased levels of IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-1 were observed in pre-operative patients compared to healthy subjects, but laparoscopy did not cause further elevation. No alteration in the IGF binary/ternary complex ratio was witnessed between any of the study groups. A significant increase in the sialic acid content of IGFBP-3 was seen in both patient groups when compared to healthy subjects. The level of urinary cortisol was significantly increased in post-operative patients, whereas the urinary IGF-I concentration was decreased compared to healthy subjects. Conclusions? Our results indicate that acute cholecystitis causes several significant changes in the circulating IGF system. Laparoscopy, however, does not aggravate such changes, but elevates urinary cortisol.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Ureteronephrectomy is the most commonly performed surgical procedure of the kidney. It is indicated when one of the kidneys is detrimental to the animal's health whilst the function of the contralateral one is adequate to sustain life. This frequently occurs in cases of advanced hydronephrosis ? usually secondary to obstruction of the ureter or the renal pelvis. Whenever possible the kidney is spared, and alternative procedures are performed to resolve the obstruction. Nephrotomy and pyelotomy are rarely performed, and recently have been associated with or superseded by ureteral stenting. All the latter procedures are technically challenging, and require advanced expertise and facilities.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the use of dual-phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography for the depiction of the features of the male genital tract, highlighting differences between entire and neutered dogs. Methods Computed tomography exams of 23 entire and 23 neutered male dogs with no history of urogenital disease were included in this retrospective study, with exams acquired pre-, 30 and 98·9 ±27·4?seconds after intravenous contrast administration. The genital structures were subjectively evaluated for visibility, contrast enhancement and enhancement pattern and differences between entire and neutered dogs were described. Objective measurements of attenuation and size of the prostatic tissue were acquired. Results The root, body and glans of the penis could be evaluated in all dogs and appeared larger in entire dogs, though objective measurements could not be reliably made because these structures are small and curved. There was contrast enhancement of the cavernous structures, most reliably in the bulb and corpus spongiosum and most frequently in entire dogs in the delayed post-contrast phase. In entire dogs, the small testicular vessels most commonly had a vermiform shape in the early post-contrast phase, and a homogeneous appearance in the delayed phase. Sternal recumbency with the coxofemoral joints extended improved visibility of the genital structures. Clinical Significance Dual-phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography is useful for depiction of the structures of the male genital tract, with the early phase especially highlighting the vascular and the delayed phase the cavernous structures.

AB  - Summary Pyothorax is an infection of the pleural space. It occurs in dogs and cats and is characterized by a septic suppurative pleural effusion. Animals with the pyothorax can have severe systemic signs, and despite a variety of potential causes the principles of therapy are relatively similar between species and etiologies. The pyothorax is most often associated with a bacterial infection. Clinical history and physical examination abnormalities in animals with the pyothorax relate to respiratory and systemic illness. Clinical signs can be present in animals for weeks to months prior to presentation. The principles of treatment of animals with the pyothorax include removal of the septic effusion and long-term treatment with appropriate antibiotics. Indications for surgical treatment of the pyothorax include evidence of a surgically resectable lesion thought to be responsible for the pyothorax, such as an abscess, mass, or foreign body, or inadequate response to medical management.

AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives: Low count of total and T helper lymphocytes predicts a poor prognosis in cancer patients and surgical trauma can worsen cancer-related immunodeficiency. Aim of this phase IB study is to verify toxicity and biological effects of interleukin-2 (IL-2) at 9 million IU/day subcutaneously (sc.) administered one, two or three preoperative days in patients with gastric cancer undergoing radical surgery. Methods: Absolute value of total and T-helper (CD4) lymphocytes were measured at baseline and at 7th, 14th, and 50th postoperative days in 12 gastric cancer patients, who preoperatively received IL-2 at 9 million IU/day sc. as follows: group A (4 pts) 1-day; group B (4 pts) 2-days; group C (4 pts) 3-days administration. T and total lymphocytes count were recorded and retrospectively analyzed in a historical control-group of 22 consecutive patients, age and stage-matched. Results: Toxicity consisted of fever grade I. In group A (1 day) T helper lymphocytes count decreased at 7th and at 14th postoperative day; in group B (2 days) and group C (3 days) no decrease of neither total nor T helper lymphocyte count occurred postoperatively, whereas in the historical group these parameters decreased significantly postoperatively and recovered only at 50th day. Conclusions: Two- and three-day schedules of sc. IL-2 preoperative administration at 9 million IU/daily prevented postoperative lymphocytopenia, whereas one-day administration did not. Since the IL-2 dose was so tolerable, that it could be given safely as outpatient, based on the previous results on survival observed in colorectal cancer patients with 3-days schedule we suggest that a 3-day schedule of Interleukin-2 as outpatient preoperative treatment seems advisable for further studies in gastric cancer patients.

AB  - Summary There are many reasons for patients to be referred. Referral is a complex situation, with multiple factors in play. Everyone involved has a perspective: the referring veterinarian, their boss or practice manager, the owner, the specialist receiving the referral, their client services manager, and so on. Viewing Frankie Fitzgerald's case from the perspectives of the various stakeholders, and seeing as the author is the one writing this, this chapter starts with the specialist to whom she was referred. A specialist in referral practice might have ungenerous thoughts about the patient who arrives, half-dead, just before the weekend, after another vet has messed around with it for three or four days. Considering the main drivers for seeking specialist input, and the turning points in any given case that might prompt referral, the chapter looks at the stages of Frankie's treatment and sees if things could have turned out differently.

AB  - Abstract Multifunctional nanomaterials for cancer therapy has attracted researchers? attention for decades. In this study, a unique oxidative method using KMnO4 or K2MnO4 as oxidizing agents to oxidize dopamine (DA) to polydopamine (PDA) was reported. The oxidizing agent was reduced to MnOx to form MnOx/PDA composite NPs. Afterwards, the MnOx/PDA composite NPs were surface-modified with bovine serum albumin (BSA) to form a multifunctional theranostic agent, named MnOx/PDA@BSA NPs, with improved colloidal stability and biocompatibility. Such a material would become a photothermal nanoagent, since the PDA renders the composite NPs an admirable photothermal transforming ability with the photothermal conversion efficiency of 27.06%. Meanwhile, as a commonly used T1 contrast agent, manganese (Mn2+) endowed the MnOx/PDA@BSA NPs with MRI ability, rendering the as-synthesized MnOx/PDA composite NPs a capability of imaging guided multi-modal tumor therapy. Moreover, the formed MnOx/PDA@BSA NPs were used for drug loading, which was found to own the tunable drug loading and controlled drug releasing capacity. The as-prepared composite NPs were successfully used for the combined tumor chemotherapy and photothermal therapy in?vitro and in?vivo. This research provides insights into the development of conjugated polymer-based nanomaterial for various biomedical applications, especially in imaging guided cancer therapy.
