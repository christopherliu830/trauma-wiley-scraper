AB  - Objective? To identify preoperative diagnostic results that predict postoperative complications and survival in feline renal-transplant recipients. Study Design? Retrospective clinical study. Animals? Sixty-one feline renal allograft recipients. Methods? Medical records for 61 consecutive cats that underwent renal allograft transplantation between January 1, 1996, and December 1, 1999, were reviewed. Age, diagnosis, body weight, body condition score, preoperative medical treatment, systolic blood pressure, packed cell volume, biochemical parameters at admission and at the time of surgery, postoperative complications, and postoperative survival were recorded. Associations of preoperative data with the occurrence of postoperative complications were determined using logistic regression. Postoperative survival was graphed using a Kaplan-Meier cumulative-survival plot. Associations of covariates with postoperative survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards analysis. Results? Two parameters were significantly associated with occurrence of postoperative central nervous system (CNS) disorders: blood urea nitrogen concentration (odds ratio = 1.083; 95% CI = 1.018 to 1.148) and serum creatinine concentration (odds ratio = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.413 to 2.187) at the time of surgery. Postoperative survival 6 months after transplantation was 59%, though 3-year survival remained at 42%. Of all covariates investigated, only recipient age (relative hazard = 1.183; 95% CI = 1.039 to 1.334) was significantly associated with survival. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance? Standard measures of preoperative renal dysfunction do not predict postoperative survival in cats after renal transplantation, although an increase in the degree of preoperative azotemia is associated with an increased risk of CNS disorders after surgery. Increased recipient age is associated with decreased survival after renal transplantation.

AB  - Summary Combined orthotopic heart and liver transplantation (CHLT) is a lifesaving procedure for patients with end-stage heart?liver disease. We reviewed the long-term outcome of patients who have undergone CHLT at the University of Bologna, Italy. Fifteen patients with heart and liver failure were placed on the transplant list between November 1999 and March 2012. The pretransplant cardiac diagnoses were familial amyloidosis in 14 patients and chronic heart failure due to chemotherapy with liver failure due to chronic hepatitis in one patient. CHLT was performed as a single combined procedure in 14 hemodynamically stable patients; there was no peri-operative mortality. The survival rates for the CHLT recipients were 93%, 93%, and 82% at 1 month and 1 and 5 years, respectively. Freedom from graft rejection was 100%, 90%, and 36% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively, for the heart graft and 100%, 91%, and 86% for the liver graft. The livers of eight recipients were transplanted as a ?domino? with mean overall 1-year survival of 93%. Simultaneous heart and liver transplantation is feasible and was achieved in this extremely sick cohort of patients. By adopting the domino technique, we were able to enlarge the donor cohort and include high-risk patients.

AB  - Abstract Objective The objective of the present study was to describe the factors associated with delays in the delivery of appropriate antibiotics to patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from the ED or wards with septic shock. Methods All adult patients admitted to the ICU, at a single centre who had presented via the ED within the previous 48?h and who had septic shock were included. Data regarding the cause of sepsis, timing of administration of antibiotics, the appropriateness of antibiotics, results of cultures and features potentially related to delay in the administration of appropriate antibiotics were collected by a single investigator, onto specifically designed data forms. Descriptive statistics and univariate analysis were undertaken to determine the timing of appropriate antibiotics administration. Results Eighty-nine patients who developed septic shock within 48?h of hospital presentation were admitted to the ICU at Royal North Shore between 2005 and 2008. The median time to administration of antibiotics was 120?min (interquartile range [IQR], 40?225) and the median time to administration of appropriate antibiotics was 188?min (IQR, 65?440?min). Patients who did not have sepsis as their initial diagnosis (90 vs 268?min; P < 0.002), those who waited until investigations were performed (88 vs 320?min; P < 0.001) and younger patients (? = ?5.6; P = 0.04) had longer time delays to receive antibiotic therapy. Patients who were assessed by an emergency physician after developing septic shock were given antibiotics that were appropriate in a median of 20?min (IQR, 10?160?min), those assessed initially by a resident medical officer after developing septic shock in a median of 180?min (IQR, 78?563?min). Conclusions This retrospective cohort study found that there were significant delays associated with the administration of appropriate antibiotics in patients admitted to the ICU from the ED or the wards with septic shock. Delays were greater in patients who were not seen by an emergency physician, those in whom the diagnosis of sepsis was not considered initially and in those whose therapy was delayed while awaiting the performance of investigations.

AB  - Cardiac surgery continues to be associated with excessive perioperative bleeding due to poorly characterised haemostatic changes associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and the trauma of major surgery. Blood component support varies between institutions and the recent introduction of recombinant VIIa promises to improve perioperative haemostasis, albeit at significant expense. Prothrombin complex concentrates (ProthrombinexTM-HT(PTX), CSL Australia) are utilised increasingly to correct excessive oral anticoagulation and have a number of advantages over FFP including greater coagulation factor concentration (particularly IX), reduced product volume and viral inactivation. There is no data on the use of PCCs in cardiac surgery. During a 6?month period (February ? August 2003), 203 patients underwent cardiac surgery at Barwon Health of whom 60 received PTX during the intra-operative or post-operative period (45 M, 15 F; Mean age 68.7?years). 28 (47%) patients underwent simple procedures (either valvular or graft surgery alone) while the remaining 32 (53%) patients had complex surgery (emergency cases, graft/valves, double valves, Bentall?s or redos). PTX was employed following the use of standard blood component support when there was evidence of persistent bleeding and abnormal laboratory coagulation studies. 20 patients intra-operatively and 34 patients post-op required no PTX. The mean dose of PTX administered intra-operatively was 595?U (range 500?2000?U) and 240?U post-operatively (range 500?1000). PTX use was associated with documented improvements in bleeding and coagulation studies; mean INRs and APTTs pre- & post- PTX 1.7?>?1.3 and 65?s?>?52s respectively. 33 (55%) patients were evaluated at 3?months through their physicians for evidence of prothrombotic sequelae. 8 patients were noted to have had potential prothrombotic complications (4 myocardial ischaemia, 1 pulmonary embolus, 1 CVA and 2 thrombophlebitis). Conclusion? On the basis of this small study, PTX is a useful adjunct to standard blood component support in cardiac surgery and may defer the use of rVIIa in this setting.

AB  - Objective? To evaluate the diagnostic potential of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared with a reference standard, arthroscopic and/or open surgery, in dogs with soft tissue shoulder pathology. Study Design? Retrospective study. Animals? Dogs (n=21). Methods? Magnetic resonance (MR) images were retrospectively evaluated in 21 dogs that had surgically identified soft tissue shoulder pathology. The musculotendinous units of the biceps, infraspinatus, teres minor, supraspinatus, subscapularis, and the medial and lateral glenohumeral ligaments (MGHL and LGHL) were graded as either normal or abnormal. Abnormal structures were further classified as being either inflamed, partially torn, or fully torn. Impingement of the biceps tendon was also evaluated. Results were reported in terms of agreement and concordance between MRI findings and surgical findings. Agreement was defined as the percentage of times MRI findings concurred with surgical findings with respect to a structure being either normal or abnormal. Concordance was defined as the percentage of times MRI concurred with the exact surgically assessed pathology when abnormality was identified. Results? The findings were biceps tendon: 90% agreement with 100% concordance; subscapularis: 95% agreement with 62% concordance; MGHL: 84% agreement with 83% concordance; LGHL: 88% agreement with 100% concordance; infraspinatus: 100% both agreement and concordance; biceps tendon impingement: 90% agreement with 100% concordance. Conclusions? Soft tissue abnormalities of the canine shoulder were readily identified on preoperative MR images. Clinical Relevance? MRI shows great potential as a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of canine shoulder disease.

AB  - Soft tissue sarcomas are derived from tissues of mesenchymal origin. Although local recurrence following surgical resection is the characteristic challenge in their management, 40% dogs with high-grade tumours may also develop metastatic disease, despite successful local control. Soft tissue sarcoma is a complex disease and there are many uncertainties regarding the biology and optimal clinical management. There are currently no diagnostic tests that can reliably predict the amount of surgical margin required for a particular tumour, so there can be a mismatch between treatment and disease. Historically, the tendency has been to always recommend wide excision margins but this is not fully supported by recent evidence. A selection bias for less aggressive soft tissue sarcomas in primary care practice can account for good outcomes that are achieved despite narrow surgical excision margins. On the other hand, inappropriately conservative treatment will adversely affect outcomes for patients with more aggressive disease. This review provides an update on the current understanding of management of canine soft tissue sarcomas.

AB  - Cochlear implants restore the inner ear hearing using electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. However, there is potential to improve the implant's function in terms of stimulation selectivity by increasing the number of electrode contacts. Meanwhile, the electrode stiffness shall not be elevated, because this would enhance insertion trauma and fibrous tissue encapsulation of the implant. Since the increase in the number of electrode contacts results in an increase of electrode stiffness, novel materials are needed for manufacturing electrode shafts. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as electrode contacts offer new perspectives concerning mechanical properties and electrode-nerve interfacing. However, by using CNTs immersed in liquid silicone rubber (LSR) as electrode material, the electrical conductivity of the bulk needs to be improved. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of using CNT?LSR as electrode material by increasing the conductivity of such materials and confirming their biocompatibility. First results show, that the electrode material can be printed in isolated layers, while the conductivity of the bulk can be improved. Fibroblasts growth tests indicated biocompatible properties of CNT?LSR samples. In conclusion CNT?LSR materials can be considered as promising candidates for use in neural implants possessing proper mechanical, electrical as well as biocompatible properties.

AB  - Objectives To characterise the presentation, clinicopathologic data and outcome of 29 dogs with presumed primary renal lymphoma. Materials and Methods Retrospective analysis of medical records of dogs with suspected primary renal lymphoma from 11 institutions. Results All dogs were substage b, and lethargy and gastrointestinal signs were common presenting complaints, as were azotaemia (n=25; 86%) and erythrocytosis (n=15; 51%) on biochemical testing. Ultrasonography typically revealed bilateral renal lesions (n=23; 79%), renomegaly (n=22; 76%) and abdominal lymphadenopathy (n=14; 48%). Chemotherapy was the only treatment in 23 dogs, of which 11 responded, all considered partial responses. For all dogs the median progression-free survival and median overall survival times were 10 days (range: 1 to 126) and 12?days (range: 1 to 212), respectively, and for dogs that responded to chemotherapy 41?days (range: 10 to 126) and 47?days (range: 10 to 212), respectively. Clinical Significance Primary renal lymphoma in dogs appears to be associated with a poor prognosis and short-lived response to chemotherapy.

AB  - Harmful algae (HA) and their toxins present increasing obstacles to routine protein production in aquatic systems. Preventing, controlling, or mitigating harmful algal blooms (HAB) and cyanobacterial HAB (cyanoHAB) have become major foci for many geographic areas and systems of the world, from freshwater ponds to openocean fish cages, problems potentially exacerbated with continued anthropogenic loading and a changing climate selecting for some bloom-forming taxa. Worldwide, aquaculture production of aquatic food in inland waters exceeds that of marine waters, but use of the sea for fish and shellfish mariculture is rapidly increasing in many coastal oceans. Multi-step linear food webs have also been used, with fish, shellfish, phytoplankton, macroalgae, and abalone. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can test fish tissue for toxin content, generally in response to reported human illnesses or to identify whether newly identified toxins or other compounds might pose health risks to consumers.

AB  - Abstract This article is about the recognition of personhood when death occurs in early life. Drawing from anthropological perspectives on personhood at the beginnings and ends of life, it examines the implications of competing religious and customary definitions of personhood for a small sample of young British Pakistani Muslim women who experienced miscarriage and stillbirth. It suggests that these women's concerns about the lack of recognition given to the personhood of their fetus or baby constitute a challenge to customary practices surrounding burial as a Muslim. The article suggests that these women's concerns cannot be adequately glossed as a clash of Islamic belief versus Western medicine. Rather, they represent a renegotiation of Islamic opinion and customary practices within the broader context of changes in the medical and social norms surrounding pregnancy loss and infant death in multi-ethnic British society.

AB  - Easily applicable, cheap, noninvasive and quantitative techniques to measure edema in skin and subcutaneous tissues have not been available. Recently, a new device MoistureMeter-D based on the local measurement of the dielectric properties of the biological tissues was validated in the quantitation of systemic edema in humans. In the present study the MoistureMeter-D was applied to quantitate local skin edema related to skin irritation. The irritation was induced in the volar forearms of 12 healthy volunteers with the topical application of 1% sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) for 6 hours. After induction the volunteers were divided into two groups: the irritation site of group I (six volunteers) had no treatment for the irritation site while for group II (six volunteers) the corticosteroid cream was topically administered on the irritation site. A good correlation was measured between the temporal changes of edema during the three days? follow-up by the ultrasound-measured skin thickness and the edema-specific MoistureMeter-D in group I (p?<?0.001). The reduction of edema in group II by the corticosteroid treatment was consistently measured by both instruments. The coefficient of variation for a single measurement varied between 2 and 3%. The results demonstrate that the MoistuMeter-D is an accurate instrument for the quick quantitative evaluation of local oedema and fluid retention in irritated skin.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate population characteristics, clinical signs and simple echocardiographic measurements of a general practice population of cats, in identifying characteristics that reliably distinguish cats with heart disease from others, including those with respiratory disease, using widely available techniques. Methods: Cats presented with heart disease (n=103), respiratory disease (n=19) and a normal group (n=29) were prospectively recruited. All cats were subject to full clinical examination, echocardiography and additional diagnostic procedures as appropriate to establish definitive diagnosis. Cats were classified as Group 1: no heart disease ± respiratory disease; Group 2: heart disease with no clinical signs; Group 3: heart disease with clinical signs. Murmur, gallop sound and arrhythmia prevalence and left atrial size were compared between the groups. Results: Low heart rates prevailed in Group 3. Murmurs were prevalent in Group 2, but in Group 3 prevalence was significantly lower. Dyspnoea, gallop sounds, arrhythmias and left atrial diameter were significantly different between groups. Clinical Significance: Heart rate is unreliable for diagnosing heart failure in cats. Absence of murmur is prevalent in cats with clinical signs of heart failure, but arrhythmia and gallop sounds are prevalent. Echocardiographic measurement of left atrial diameter >16.5 mm may distinguish heart failure from respiratory disease in general practice.

AB  - Abstract Stem cell-based therapy may be the most promising method to cure skeletal muscle degenerative diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and trauma in the future. Human amniotic fluid is enriched with early-stage stem cells from developing fetuses and these cells have cardiomyogenic potential both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we investigated the characteristics of human amniotic fluid-derived AF-type stem (HAF-AFS) cells by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation analysis. After confirming the stemness of HAF-AFS cells, we tested whether HAF-AFS cells could differentiate into skeletal myogenic cells in vitro and incorporate into regenerating skeletal muscle in vivo. By temporary exposure to the DNA demethylation agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza dC) or co-cultured with C2C12 myoblasts, HAF-AFS cells differentiated into skeletal myogenic cells, expressing skeletal myogenic cell-specific markers such as Desmin, Troponin I (Tn I) and α-Actinin. Four weeks after transplantation into cardiotoxin-injured and X-ray-irradiated tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of NOD/SCID mice, HAF-AFS cells survived, differentiated into myogenic precursor cells and fused with host myofibres. The findings that HAF-AFS cells differentiate into myogenic cells in vitro and incorporate in skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo hold the promise of HAF-AFS cell-based therapy for skeletal muscle degenerative diseases.

AB  - Abstract Williams?Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a multi-system disorder that requires ongoing management by a primary care physician familiar with the natural history and common medical problems associated with the condition. Some abnormalities are unique to WBS, such as the elastin arteriopathy that often manifests as supravalvar aortic stenosis and hypertension. Still other features, such as diverticulosis, are seen in the general population but tend to present earlier in WBS. Life long monitoring of the cardiovascular and endocrine systems is essential to the clinical management of individuals with Williams?Beuren syndrome. Constipation should be aggressively managed, and symptoms of abdominal pain should prompt an evaluation for diverticulosis/diverticulitis. While the mean IQ of WBS is in the mild mental retardation range, difficulties with attention and anxiety are more likely to negatively impact independent functioning in the adult with WBS. There is no evidence for decline in cognitive ability over time, but adaptive functioning may be improved with treatment of anxiety by both behavior and medical modalities. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Topical treatments have been used in wound care for centuries. Many of the treatments, however, have not ? or only to a very limited degree ? undergone scientific scrutiny. This is especially true for many of the products that are available over the counter. Determining the contents of many of these products can be difficult, and as a rule of thumb, products without a list of ingredients should not be used on wounds. In contrast, effects of wound cleansers and solutions used for irrigation have been investigated in several studies. Although cleansers and antiseptics had, for some years, fallen out of favor due to their detrimental effects on cells cultured in vitro, current best evidence suggests that they may be of benefit if used judiciously. The negative impact on cell cultures has, in many studies, not been replicated when the products were used in vivo. Use of antiseptics on heavily contaminated or infected wounds seems to enhance healing through a reduction of the wound's bioburden.

AB  - Abstract We have developed a magnetic resonance molecular imaging method using a novel iron-oxide contrast agent targeted towards P-selectin ? MNP-PBP (magnetic nanoparticle-P-selectin binding peptide) ? to image endothelial activation following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. MNP-PBP consists of ?1000 PBP ligands (primary sequence: GSIQPRPQIHNDGDFEEIPEEYLQ GGSSLVSVLDLEPLDAAWL) conjugated to a 50?nm diameter aminated dextran iron oxide particle. In vitro P- and E-selectin binding was assessed by competition ELISA. Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced in male C57/BL 6 mice followed by contrast injection (MNP-PBP; MNP-NH2; Feridex; MNP-PBP-FITC) at 24?h after reperfusion and T2 magnetic resonance imaging at 9.4 T was performed. Infarction and microvasculature accumulation of contrast agent was assessed in coronal brain sections. MNP-PBP attenuated antibody binding to P-selectin by 34.8?±?1.7%. P-selectin was preferentially increased in the infarct hemisphere and MNP-PBP-FITC accumulation in the infarct hemisphere microvasculature was observed. Compared with the nontargeted iron oxide agents MNP-NH2 and Feridex, MNP-PBP showed a significantly greater T2 effect within the infarction. MR imaging of P-selectin expression with a targeted iron oxide nanoparticle contrast agent may reveal early endothelial activation in stroke and other neuroinflammatory states.

AB  - For at least 30 years it has been well known that very small electric currents applied to various kinds of trauma have a beneficial therapeutic result for wounds. The most effective methods so far utilized some form of direct current, by inserting an electric lead on each side of the wound and passing a weak electric current across the wound. The drawback of this method is invasive. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a noninvasive electric magnetic field device, Field Therapy Accelerator or FTA (Advatech Corp.), on cell migration of human skin keratinocytes in an in vitro incitional wound model. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes were maintained in growth media and grow into confluent. At time 0, a cross-shaped wound gap or cell-free zone was made among confluent monolayer cells in the center of the culture dish. Cells were treated with FTA for 1 hour immediately after wounding and 1 hour every 24 hours for a total of 4 hours in 4 days. The cell cultures were examined at time 0 and every 24 hours thereafter. A Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope with a digital camera system was used to capture the images and an AxioVision 3.0 image analysis software was used to measure the gap area. Cell migration was quantified by the time and percentage of the wound gap covered by the cells that migrated in and filled the gap. The results showed that the FTA treatment significantly accelerates skin keratinocyte migration. The wound gaps completely filled 6 days after wounding, 3 days earlier than control (no treatment) group (P?<?0.001). Cell migration is a key step leading to the reepithelialization or the restoration of skin structure. This study showed the strong effects of FTA on keratinocyte migration, suggesting one of mechanisms that electric magnetic field works on wound healing.
