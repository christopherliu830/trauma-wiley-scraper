AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to determine whether three-dimensional ultrasound (3-D US) can improve the diagnostic ability in a routine check-up of patients undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) in an office practice. Methods Three-dimensional and power Doppler ultrasound were performed on 267 patients undergoing IVF on the first visit, during ovulation induction and aspiration of the oocytes. Patients with suspected uterine anomalies and/or abnormalities of the endometrium (N?=?108) were treated by operative hysteroscopy. On the day of oocyte collection, multiplanar imaging and 3-D reconstruction demonstrated cumuli in follicles greater than 15?mm. Cumulus assessment inside the ovarian follicles was correlated to the number of mature oocytes. Power Doppler reconstruction was performed in the cases when superponing vessels did not allow correct placing of the puncture needle. Results Of 108 patients with suspected uterine abnormality, the diagnosis was correct in all cases of endometrial polyp, submucous myoma, arcuate uteri and septate uteri, as confirmed by an office hysteroscopy. Intrauterine synechiae was correctly diagnosed preoperatively in one out of the four cases. The mean (±?SD) number of follicles >?18?mm was 8.2?±?5.8, and total number of follicles demonstrating cumulus in all three planes was 6.4?±?5.1. The ratio cumuli/retrieved oocytes, cumuli/fertilised oocytes and cumuli/mature oocytes was 6.2?±?4.2, 5.4?±?2.8 and 5.9?±?2.6, respectively. Conclusions Three dimensional ultrasound can become a standard of routine check-up of infertility patients allowing improved recognition of the uterine anatomy, characterisation of the surface features, and precise depiction of the ovaries during stimulation cycles. It can enhance and facilitate the morphologic and functional evaluation of the anatomic structures of the inner reproductive organs, thus avoiding the need of invasive diagnostic procedures. Various puncturing procedures can be more precisely performed. The built-in application of live 3-D mode may be very helpful in performing invasive procedures, such as oocyte collection.

AB  - Abstract In Asia, the incidence of pancreatic cancer in some countries has been increasing. Owing to most cases being diagnosed late, prognosis for pancreatic cancer remains dismal. It is clear that the future for pancreatic cancer lies in early detection. While the possible presence of pancreatic masses is often first raised by non-invasive abdominal imaging, such as computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, smaller lesions and locoregional lymph node metastases are often not detectable by these means. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) offers a higher sensitivity (93?100%) for detection of small potentially curable pancreatic masses than other existing imaging modalities. It is also recommended for the evaluation of portal vein confluence, portal vein, celiac axis, and superior mesentric artery origin, and exclusion of resectability. Due to the closer proximity of EUS to the target structure, and lower rate of needle tract seeding, EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration of pancreatic mass is considered the most suitable tissue acquisition technique. Lastly, EUS also enables the performance of endoscopic interventions. Its performance can be further enhanced with newer techniques, including contrast-enhanced ultrasound and elastrography. It is anticipated that in the near future, molecular technologies may make it possible to detect microscopic amounts of cancer in tissue or blood, predict relapse and survival after therapy, as well as determine optimal therapy.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare changes in wound size and appearance and health complication rates in patients with vasculopathy and lower-extremity wounds treated with or without low-frequency contact ultrasound debridement (LFCUD) This study was a randomised controlled trial. The study was conducted in a vascular surgery service, including outpatient wound clinic and inpatient ward, in a tertiary care academic centre. In total, 70 patients with vasculopathy and lower-extremity wounds of mixed aetiology were enrolled in the trial; 68 completed the study. Patients were randomised to receive LFCUD plus usual care (n = 33) or usual care (n = 37) at 4 weekly visits, and were followed thereafter for up to 12 wk. The main outcome measures included closed wounds, change in wound surface area (WSA), and wound appearance by the revised Photographic Wound Assessment Tool (revPWAT). After 4 weekly LFCUD treatments, patients in the LFCUD group had significantly better wound appearance (total revPWAT score) compared with the control group treated only with usual care (P = <0.05). LFCUD-treated wounds also had a significant reduction in WSA over 4 wk that was not found in the UC group. LFCUD treatment was also associated with a greater number of healed wounds, odds ratio 5.00 (95% CI 1.24-20.25), and fewer instances of wound deterioration. Weekly LFCUD applications to patients with significant vasculopathy resulted in superior healing outcomes when compared with current usual wound care practice.

AB  - Recently suggested role of tamoxifen as a preventive agent in women at high risk of breast cancer has a potential to increase significantly the number of women treated with tamoxifen agent. By the fact that tamoxifen is beneficial in taming the breast cancer, but detrimental to the uterus by increasing the risk of endometrial carcinoma, hyperplasia, and development of endometrial polyps, surveillance of endometrial changes in patients on tamoxifen is needed. However, no cost-effective method has been found for screening for the rare occurrence of endometrial carcinoma. Therefore, the ACOG does not recommend routine endometrial screening of tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients. Regardless of aforementioned recommendation, ultrasound (US) is very helpful as a first line for diagnosis of endometrial pathology in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with previous endometrial pathology. Endometrial thickness <?5?mm is reassuring,?>?5?8?mm calls for further investigation such as sonohysterography to rule out polyps. If it fails to demonstrate polyps, but cystic structures still present and letter on endometrial biopsy (or D  2. Follow up with endometrial biopsy/D  or 3.

AB  - Summary The use of periclavicular brachial plexus block as regional anaesthesia for surgical procedures on the upper extremity is common. However, the proximity of the pleura results in a risk of pneumothorax. Without ultrasound monitoring, the pneumothorax risk has been reported to be as high as 6.1%. We conducted a prospective, observational study to examine the risk of pneumothorax in 6366 ultrasound-guided periclavicular plexus blocks. All patients with a clinically manifest and radiologically confirmed pneumothorax were analysed. Clinically symptomatic pneumothorax occurred in four patients (0.06%; 95% CI 0.001?0.124), in three of them after a two-day latency period. Ultrasound guidance does therefore appear to reduce the risk of pneumothorax. Although all of the anaesthesiologists involved in the complications had previously performed fewer than 20 blocks, we are not able to confirm that a block experience ≤ 20 is a significant risk factor. Faulty image-setting, inability to obtain a view of the needle tip and inadequate supervision are likely to be important risk factors.

AB  - Summary Teeth have two regions where trauma can cause irreparable damage: the dental pulp and periodontium. The classification of the injury type, and signs and symptoms may not fully indicate the true extent of the injury, which may be multi-factorial. Exposure or near exposure of the pulp in the mouth and damage to the neurovascular bundle can result in one of several different outcomes for the dental pulp. The rate of pulp necrosis with a number of different injuries varies with age and the stage of tooth development. Endodontic treatment would only be commenced if there were signs and symptoms of an endodontic infection. A thorough history and examination are necessary to not only reveal the full extent of injuries to the teeth and jaws, but also to exclude more serious injuries, such as concussion and neck injuries, which may need urgent medical care.

AB  - Abstract Aim To evaluate in a clinical trial the efficacy of reciprocating and ultrasonic activation of 6% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) in the microbial composition and reduction in microbial load as well as in levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) in teeth with primary endodontic infections. Methodology Samples were collected from 24 root canals with pulp necrosis and periapical lesions, before and after chemo-mechanical canal preparation. The teeth were randomly divided according to the activation protocol as follows: control group without activation (WA, n = 8), reciprocating activation group using Easy Clean tip (EC, n = 8) and ultrasonic activation group using Irrisonic insert (US, n = 8). Microbiological specimens were processed using a culture technique and microbiota composition was analysed using the checkerboard technique. The levels of LPS and LTA were quantified using limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. The Fisher's exact test, Kruskal?Wallis, Dunn?s and Wilcoxon?s test with a significance level of P < 0.05 were used for statistical analysis. Results All initial specimens had growth of viable bacteria in fastidious anaerobe agar (FAA), with an average of 105 CFU mL?1, whereas only one case had such growth after chemo-mechanical canal preparation. LPS and LTA were recovered in 100% of the cases. Chemo-mechanical canal preparation significantly decreased the levels of LPS and LTA (P < 0.05), but no significant differences were found between the groups (P > 0.05). Through the checkerboard technique, bacteria were found in 100% of the initial specimens with concentrations between <105 and 106. The most frequently identified microorganisms were Prevotella nigrescens and Enterococcus hirae. After chemo-mechanical canal preparation, many species were not detected in any of the three groups tested. A significant reduction occurred in Group US, followed by Groups EC and WA. Conclusions Activation of 6% NaOCl reduced the levels of LPS and LTA with no differences between the groups. However, ultrasonic activation was associated with a greater reduction in microbial load within root canals.

AB  - Abstract Albeit no direct anatomical information can be obtained, neurosonological methods provide real-time determination of velocity, and spectral waveform of blood flow in basal intracranial arteries adds significant benefit to the care of the patients with neurovascular diseases. Several features, such as relative simplicity in terms of interpretation and performance, significantly low cost, totally non-invasiveness, portability, and excellent temporal resolution, make neurosonology increasingly popular tool for evaluation, planning, and monitoring of treatment, and for determining prognosis in various neurovascular diseases. Usefulness of transcranial Doppler in diagnosing/monitoring subarachnoid hemorrhage related vasospasm and sickle cell vasculopathy is already well known. Utility in diagnosis of intracranial arterial stenosis, acute occlusion and recanalization, intracranial hemodynamic effect of the cervical arterial pathologies, intracranial pressure increase, and cerebral circulatory arrest are also well established. Neurosonological determination of vasomotor reactivity, cerebral autoregulation, neurovascular coupling, and micro-embolic signals detection are useful in the assessment of stroke risk, diagnosis of right-to-left shunting, and monitoring during surgery and interventional procedures. Transcranial Doppler is also an evolving ultrasound method with a therapeutic potential such as augmentation of clot lysis and cerebral delivery of thrombolytic or neuroprotective agent loaded nanobubbles in neurovascular diseases. The aim of this study is to give an overview of current usage of the different ultrasound modalities in different neurovascular diseases.

AB  - Abstract Low-intensity ultrasound accelerates fracture healing in humans. In rat femur fracture models, ultrasound advanced healing is associated with increased proteoglycan expression. Here we report that ultrasound stimulation of primary rat chondrocytes elevated the intracellular concentration of calciums [Ca2+]i. The [Ca2+]i increase was rapid and transient at lower pressures (175?320 kPa), but rapid and sustained at higher ultrasound exposures (350?500 kPa). Chelating internal [Ca2+]i with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N-N-N?-N?-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA-AM), stopping the Ca2+/ATP-ase induced mitochondrial release of [Ca2+]i with Thapsigargin, or removing [Ca2+]i from the medium with EGTA inhibited the stimulatory effects of ultrasound on proteoglycan synthesis. These results imply that ultrasound-stimulated synthesis of cell matrix proteoglycan, associated with accelerated fracture healing, is mediated by intracellular calcium signaling. ? 2002 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Background: The kidney is the most frequently injured abdominal organ in children and controversy surrounds some aspects of management. This study looks at the experience of our institution and reviews the literature towards developing an optimal strategy for managing this common childhood injury. Methods: One hundred and forty-two cases of paediatric renal trauma are reported from a catchment population of approximately 240 000 children < 14 years of age over a 12 year period. Injuries were classified into four groups: groups 1 and 2 were regarded as minor injuries (85%) and group 3 and 4 injuries were those with extravasation of urine or pedicle injury (15%). Results: The male:female ratio was 2:I with an average age of 8.5 years. Major renal injuries frequently required large amounts of resuscitation fluid. Associated injuries were present in 41% of all cases with an average of two injuries each. With one exception in each case, the development of complications and the need for early surgery were confined to major injuries. There were no long-term complications. The renal loss rate was 2.1%. Conclusions: Renal injuries can be usefully classified into major or minor by determining whether extravasation of urine or pedicle injury is present. Minor injuries should be managed conservatively. Major injuries causing ongoing haemorrhage require urgent surgery. Other major injuries should be imaged regularly and patients with more severe urinomas benefit from early elective surgery at 2?5 days. In cases where extravasation of urine has not shown clear evidence of settling by 5 days' elective surgery probably results in less morbidity and fewer complications than protracted conservative treatment.

AB  - Background: Since 1992 the Consultative Committee on Road Traffic Fatalities in Victoria has identified deficiencies and errors in the management of 559 road traffic fatalities in which the patients were alive on arrival of ambulance services. The Committee also assessed the preventability of deaths. Reproducibility of results using its methodology has been shown to be statistically significant. The Committee?s findings and recommendations, the latter made in association with the learned Colleges and specialist Societies, led to the establishment of a Ministerial Taskforce on Trauma and Emergency Services. As a consequence, in 2000, a new trauma care system will be implemented in Victoria. This paper presents a case example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology. Methods: The Committee has two 12 member multidisciplinary evaluative panels. A retrospective evaluation was made of the complete ambulance, hospital and autopsy records of eligible fatalities. The clinical and pathological findings were analysed using a comprehensive data proforma, a narrative summary and the complete records. Resulting multidisciplinary discussion problems were identified and the potential preventability of death was assessed. Results: In the present case example the Committee identified 16 management deficiencies of which 11 were assessed as having contributed to the patient?s death; the death, however, was judged to be non-preventable. Conclusion: The presentation of this example demonstrating the Committee?s methodology may be of assistance to hospital medical staff undertaking their own major trauma audit.

AB  - Background and Aim Previous studies comparing endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) results with different gauge needles have all been carried out with the stylet in place and show no clear advantage to the larger 22-G needle. Similar data for stylet-free EUS-FNA (SF-EUS-FNA) are unavailable. The aim of the present study was to determine whether diagnostic yield and specimen adequacy is superior with the 22-G needle as compared to the 25-G needle. Methods All patients ≥18 years referred for solid-lesion EUS-FNA were eligible. Patients with suspected diagnosis of lymphoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, sarcoidosis, significant coagulopathy (international normalized ratio >1.5 or platelets <50?000/mm3), use of clopidogrel within 7 days of EUS, and pregnancy were excluded. The two needles were compared regarding diagnostic yield, sample adequacy, bloodiness, ease of puncture, visibility, number of passes, failures, and complications. Results One hundred and twenty consecutive patients were included and 126 lesions were sampled. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for the 22-G SF-EUS-FNA were 83%, 100%, 100% and 56%, respectively, and for the 25-G SF-EUS-FNA were 88.8%, 100%, 100% and 76.5%, respectively (P?=?NS). There were no significant differences between the 22-G and the 25-G FNA needles in sample adequacy, bloodiness, ease of puncture, FNA failure, visibility, number of passes and complications; and no significant differences between either needle were found in relation to lesion site. Conclusion For SF-EUS-FNA, the larger 22-G needle offers no advantage over the smaller 25-G needle.

AB  - To cite this article: ?Cohen G, Campbell PM, Rossouw PE, Buschang PH:?Effects of increased surgical trauma on rates of tooth movement and apical root resorption in foxhound dogs?Orthod Craniofac Res 2010;13:179?190 Structured Abstract Authors??? Cohen G, Campbell PM, Rossouw PE, Buschang PH Purpose??? To experimentally determine the effects of increased surgical trauma on the rates of tooth movement and apical root resorption. Two surgical techniques for rapid protraction of multi-rooted teeth in foxhound dogs immediately following premolar extraction were compared. Methods??? Split-mouth design to randomly assign two surgical techniques [periodontal ligament distraction (RAP side) and a modified form of dentoalveolar distraction (RAP+ side)] to the maxillary quadrants. First premolars were extracted, and second premolars were protracted 0.5?mm per day for 15?days using a custom made jack-screw distractor. Serial caliper and radiographic measurements were performed to quantify tooth movements and apical root resorption. Results??? Both techniques demonstrated significant movement of the crown and apex. The second premolar crowns were protracted significantly more on the RAP+ side (2.9?mm) than on the RAP (1.8?mm) side. The premolars on both sides demonstrated significant tipping (4.3 and 3.9 degrees for the RAP+ and RAP sides, respectively). The distal root apex showed almost twice as much apical root resorption than the mesial root apex, but resorption was limited (<0.16?mm) and not statistically different between sides. Conclusions??? Increased surgical trauma increased the rate and, ultimately, the amount of tooth movement. The heavy forces used to protract the teeth produced statistically, but not clinically, significant apical root resorption on the mesial and distal roots of the maxillary second premolars.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Perineural analgesia of the equine maxillary nerve is used for diagnostic and surgical procedures. Little data exists to evaluate accuracy and complication rates with current techniques. Objectives This study compared 2 previously described approaches to maxillary nerve analgesia, and a novel needle guidance positioning system (SonixGPS?, Ultrasonix Medical Corporation, Richmond, British Columbia, Canada), assessing relative accuracy and complication rates of each method when performed by inexperienced operators. Study design Cadaver study. Methods Clinical veterinary students performed surface landmark, ultrasound and GPS guided contrast injections, to simulate maxillary nerve blocks in 38 equine cadaver heads. Computed tomography was then used to assess accuracy (successful deposition of contrast in contact with the maxillary nerve), and complication rate (contrast identified within surrounding vasculature or periocular structures), associated with each method. Results Perineural injection of contrast around the maxillary nerve was attempted 76 times, with an overall success rate of 65.8% (50/76), and complication rate of 53.9% (41/76). Success rates were 50% (13/26) with surface landmark, 65.4% (17/26) with ultrasound and 83.3% (20/24) with GPS guided approaches (Fisher's exact P?=?0.046). No significant difference in complication rate was found between the 3 methods. Conclusions Ultrasound guided maxillary nerve blocks are significantly more accurate than surface landmark approaches when performed by inexperienced operators, and best success rates are achieved with GPS needle guidance. All 3 methods were equivalent in terms of complication rates when performed in cadavers.
