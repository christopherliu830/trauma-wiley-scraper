AB  - Summary Hypoglycemia is one of the most frequent endocrine emergencies in individuals with diabetes mellitus. However, hypoglycemia in the healthy or non-diabetic individual is rare. This review will focus on the pathophysiology, management, and etiology of hypoglycemia in persons with and without diabetes. Hypoglycemia in persons with diabetes will focus on multiple factors including hypoglycemic unawareness, glucose monitoring, medication management, and comorbidities. Hypoglycemia in the non-diabetic individual can have multiple etiologies and poses a diagnostic challenge. It is important to respond quickly and appropriately to acute hypoglycemia in any individual. Although broad, the etiology of hypoglycemia must include a comprehensive and individualized review of medical, family, social, and pharmacologic patient histories.

AB  - Although the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in men is multi-factorial, testosterone is known to play an important role in the maintenance of the male skeleton. This role, however, appears complicated as it may be mediated in part by aromatization to oestradiol. Testosterone replacement therapy improves bone density in men with hypogonadal osteoporosis, particularly if the epiphyses are still open. There is no well-established treatment for idiopathic osteoporosis in men, but testosterone supplementation may prove to be useful. Further studies are required to confirm the safety and efficacy of this treatment in eugonadal men with osteoporosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to examine the utility of capsule endoscopy to detect mucosal abnormalities in dogs with gastrointestinal haemorrhage. METHODS Capsules were administered to 2 healthy controls and 8 patients with gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Images were evaluated for quality, gastric emptying time, small intestinal transit time and presence of lesions. RESULTS There were no adverse effects of capsule endoscopy in dogs weighing from 7·7 to 58 kg. The capsule traversed the entire gastrointestinal tract in 5 of 8 patients, with high quality images obtained in the stomach and small intestine. Gastric emptying time and small intestinal transit time ranged from 1 to 270 and 15 to 180 minutes, respectively. In 3 of 8 patients, the capsule remained in the stomach despite pro-kinetics. Gastric lesions included mild haemorrhage and pinpoint erosion (4 of 8), a mass (1) and thickened bleeding pyloric mucosa (2). Two of 3 dogs with capsule retention had gastric lesions. Intestinal lesions included a healing duodenal ulcer, abnormal villi, ileal ulceration and colonic bleeding. Lesions identified by capsule endoscopy were considered a significant source of haemorrhage in 4 of 7 dogs with active bleeding. The relevance of pinpoint gastric mucosal erosions to blood loss is unclear. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Capsule endoscopy can enable the non-invasive detection of gastric and small intestinal mucosal lesions in dogs presenting for evaluation of gastrointestinal bleeding.

AB  - Objectives: 1) Describe the clinical course and diagnostic findings of cats with histopathologic evidence of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 2) Identify risk factors for ALI/ARDS in cats. Animals: Sixty-five client-owned cats with moderate to severe interstitial pneumonia, pneumonitis or alveolitis consistent with ALI/ARDS on post-mortem examination and clinical evidence of respiratory compromise. Procedure: Retrospective evaluation of medical records, postmortem examination and radiographs. Results: Cats in this study tended to be middle aged (mean 6.5±4.9 years). They had a short duration of illness (median 4 days; range 0?120 days) and of dyspnea (median 1 day; range 1?7 days). On presentation, the cats were tachypneic (mean respiratory rate 53±23?bpm) and relatively bradycardic (mean heart rate 166±43?bpm). The majority of cats were dyspneic (n=39) at presentation; all others developed respiratory difficulties during hospitalization. The mean white blood cell count was within normal limits (14.6±14.0?k/?L); 8 cats had a leukocytosis and 7 were leucopenic. Clinical findings consistent with SIRS (n=39) and sepsis (n=10) were common. Thoracic radiographs were reviewed in 31 cats and alveolar disease was the most frequent pattern (105 lung lobes) followed by interstitial disease (86 lung lobes). No cat had normal thoracic radiographs throughout hospitalization. Underlying disease was not identified on post-mortem examination in 15 cats (23%), but in the remaining cats underlying diseases included infectious systemic disease (n=11), neoplasia (n=8), respiratory (n=8) and urinary (n=7) system disorders, acute pancreatitis (n=7), hepatic diseases (n=5), major trauma (n=4), sepsis (n=3), CNS (n=2) and other systems (n=5). Nine cats had more then one underlying process. Conclusions: This study describes a naturally-occurring syndrome of ALI/ARDS in cats analogous to that which occurs in dogs and humans. In cats, ALI/ARDS occurs as a sequela of a variety of underlying systemic diseases, but in approximately one-quarter of patients an underlying cause is not identified at necropsy. It is important to consider ALI/ARDS in systemically ill cats who become dyspneic; in cats with pulmonary disease with acute worsening of respiratory status and in cats with pulmonary infiltrates for which no other cause can be identified.

AB  - Objective While complementary medicine use among ED paediatric patients is common, the use of alternative therapies (ATs; physical or spiritual therapies) is unknown. We aimed to determine the 12 month period prevalence and nature of AT use among paediatric patients and parent perceptions of AT use. Methods We undertook a cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of parents of paediatric patients in three EDs in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia (January?June, 2015). Parents were invited to complete a validated, anonymous, self-administered questionnaire. The main outcomes were AT use by the patient and parent perceptions of ATs. Results A total of 806 parents were enrolled. In the previous 12 months, 393 (48.8%) patients had received at least one AT. There were no gender or ethnicity differences between AT users and non-users. AT use was more common among older patients (P?<?0.05). Patients with chronic illness tended to use more ATs (P?=?0.12).?A total of 1091 courses of 43 different ATs had been provided. The most common were massage (16% of patients), chiropractic therapy (9.8%), relaxation (7.2%), meditation (6.2%) and aromatherapy (6.1%). ATs were generally used for musculoskeletal problems, health maintenance, stress and anxiety. Parents who arranged the ATs were significantly more likely to report that ATs are safe, prevent and treat illness, assist prescription medicines and offer a more holistic approach to healthcare (P?<?0.001). Conclusion AT use is common among paediatric ED patients. Parents who arrange AT have differing perceptions of AT usefulness and safety from those who do not.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine those factors which are predictive of outcome in cases of thoracic empyema that are solely community acquired. All patients admitted with a diagnosis of thoracic empyema in the Auckland region between 1993 and 1995 were reviewed retrospectively. Both clinical and radiological outcomes were determined at 3?6 month follow up. Radiological outcomes were scored on admission, discharge and follow up by blinded chest radiograph review based on lung field opacification, extent and thickness of pleura. Forty-six cases fulfilled inclusion criteria. Mean age was 56 ± 21 years, 67% were male and there was no ethnic preponderance. Forty-six per cent of cases had specific underlying risk factors. Multi-loculated cases of empyema occurred in 63%, pleural aspirate was culture positive in 59% and Streptococcus milleri represented 42% of all positive cultures. Delay in appropriate management was 5.2 ± 4.2 days. Fifty-six per cent of total procedures incorporated intrapleural streptokinase as an adjunct to drainage. The cure rate was 93.3% without requirement for surgical intervention. Two patients died early giving a 4.3% mortality rate. Radiological scores were 8.6 ± 0.6 on admission, 6.3 ± 1.5 on discharge and 2.5 ± 2.5 at follow up. Improvement in radiological scores was statistically significant from admission to discharge and follow up (P<0.001). The total duration of hospitalization was 22 ± 10 days and by univariate analysis was predicted by: pleural sepsis not involving S. milleri (P = 0.001), specific predisposing factors (P = 0.02), and frank pus on pleural aspiration (P = 0.03). Total delay in management was suggestive in prolonging the duration of hospitalization (P = 0.07). Parapneumonic thoracic empyema is an important source of morbidity which is determined by both patient and management factors. Good results can be obtained by prompt medical therapy including tube drainage and intrapleural streptokinase without need for surgical intervention.

AB  - Abstract Objective To report signalment, clinical signs, preoperative staging tests, histologic diagnosis, surgical, and oncologic outcomes including postoperative limb use, in dogs with scapular tumors treated by scapulectomy. Study Design Retrospective case series Animals Dogs (n?=?42) with scapular tumors. Methods Medical records (1995?2010) from 6 hospitals were searched for dogs with scapular tumors treated by scapulectomy. Data retrieved were: signalment, weight, percentage of scapula removed, histologic diagnosis, postoperative limb use, adjunctive therapy, disease free interval (DFI), and survival time (ST). Individual variables were modeled with a Cox proportional hazard model accounting for censoring to determine risk factors for decreased DFI and ST. For categorical variables, Kaplan?Meier survival plots as well as mean and median survival times (MSTs) were calculated. Results Subtotal scapulectomy was performed in 18 dogs (42.9%). Osteosarcoma (OSA) was diagnosed in 27 dogs (64.3%). Limb use was evaluated immediately after surgery in 41 dogs. Information on limb use at other times (1, 2, 3, and >3 months) postoperatively was also available for some dogs and was good to excellent overall. Only adjunctive chemotherapy had a positive significant effect on DFI (P?=?.00011) and ST (P?=?.0003). Conclusion Canine scapular tumors can be treated effectively by scapulectomy and limb use is fair to excellent for most dogs. OSA was the most common scapular tumor. Overall prognosis for scapular OSA is similar to appendicular OSA at other sites and use of adjunctive chemotherapy prolonged the overall DFI and MST.

AB  - Objective To understand challenges in care after stillbirth and provide tailored solutions. Design Multi-centre case study. Setting Three maternity hospitals. Population Parents with a stillborn baby, maternity staff. Methods Thematic analysis of parent interviews and staff focus groups and service provision investigation. Outcomes 1 Themes; 2 Triangulation matrix; 3 Recommendations. Results Twenty-one women, 14 partners, and 22 staff participated. Service Provision: Care for parents after stillbirth varies excessively; there are misconceptions; post-mortem does not delay follow-up. Presentation: Women ?do not feel right? before stillbirth; their management is haphazard and should be standardised. Diagnosis: Stillbirth is an emergency for parents but not always for staff; communication can seem cold; well-designed bereavement space is critical. Birth: Staff shift priorities to mother and future, but for parents their baby is still a baby; parents are not comfortable with staff recommending vaginal birth as the norm; there are several reasons why parents ask for a caesarean; better care involves clear communication, normal behaviour, and discussion of coping strategies. Post-mortem: Parents are influenced by discussions with staff. Staff should ?sow seeds?, clarify its respectful nature, delineate its purpose, and explain the timescale. Follow-up: It is not standardised; parents wish to see their multi-professional team. Conclusions There is unacceptable variation in care after stillbirth, and insensitive interactions between staff and bereaved parents. Understanding parents' needs, including why they ask for caesarean birth, will facilitate joint decision-making. Every bereaved parent is entitled to good, respectful care. Tweetable abstract Care too varied  national pathway & training urgently needed Plain Language Summary Why and how was the study carried out? Previous studies have shown that improving care after stillbirth is important for families. We investigated the opinions of bereaved parents and maternity staff to find ways to improve care. At three hospitals in 2013, all women who experienced a stillbirth were invited to an interview along with their partners. Thirty-five parents of 21 babies agreed to participate. Twenty-two obstetricians and midwives took part in focus group discussions. What were the main findings? Care was often not as good as it should and could be. Communication with parents was not always as sensitive as they would have liked because staff did not have appropriate training. Some women reported they did not ?feel right? before going to hospital. Once they arrived, there was no standard approach to how care was given. Sometimes there were long delays before the death of the baby was confirmed and action was taken. After it had been confirmed that the baby had died, staff focussed on the mothers? needs, but the parents? priorities were still with their baby. There were several reasons why parents asked for a caesarean birth that staff had not considered. Staff influenced parents? decisions about post-mortem examinations. Parents found it helpful when staff explained the respectful nature and purpose of the examination. After discharge from hospital, there was no consistent plan for how follow-up care would be given. Parents would have liked more information about their next hospital appointment. What are the limitations of the work? The parents interviewed depended on their memories of the details of the care, which happened some time ago. In staff group discussions, junior doctors may not have spoken openly because there were senior doctors present. Further research is necessary to understand and improve care globally. What is the implication for parents? Every bereaved parent is entitled to the best possible care after stillbirth, but some do not get good care. Parents and staff made suggestions that can help to develop processes for how care is given after stillbirth. These suggestions can also inform staff training, so that every single parent is treated respectfully and participates in decision making.

AB  - Objective: To describe the computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging features of segmental caudal vena cava aplasia and associated vascular anomalies in dogs. Methods: A retrospective study was performed reviewing computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging archives of eight institutions for dogs with segmental caudal vena cava aplasia. Inclusion criteria included a computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging study and supportive diagnostic and follow-up information. Abdominal vessels were reviewed for size, shape, location and course (including tributaries and branches) and classified as normal, abnormal or shunt vessels. Results: Ten dogs with segmental caudal vena cava aplasia were identified. In all dogs, postrenal caval blood was shunted to either a right or a left azygos vein, with seven different angiographic patterns. Affected dogs were predominantly female (70 per cent) and young (mean 2·6 years). Additional portocaval and porto-azygos shunt vessels were identified in two cases each. Computed tomographic angiography and magnetic resonance angiography depicted details of abdominal vessels including thrombus formation in one dog. Clinical Significance: Segmental caudal vena cava aplasia is a vascular congenital anomaly in the dog that can be associated with thrombosis and portosystemic shunts. Computed tomographic angiography and magnetic resonance angiography are excellent tools to demonstrate the complex vascular anatomy and to guide treatment planning for portosystemic shunts and thrombolytic therapy.

AB  - Summary Orthodontic forces, the prescription for correcting malocclusions, are considered to have a multi-potential nature. Research has also shed light on the elevated levels of signaling molecules in the gingival crevicular fluid of moving teeth, both useful and harmful to the human body. The main effects, which are categorized as periodontal destruction following orthodontic mechanics, are loss of attachment and bone loss. External apical root resorption (EARR) entails a permanent shortening of dental roots, and formation of large lacunae that erode the roots laterally. Lacerations or irritations to oral mucosal tissues are a common clinical observation in the orthodontic office. Allergy or sensitivity reactions may occur with alloying components such as nickel, chromium and cobalt, which are often incorporated in orthodontic attachments and archwires.

AB  - The congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a rapidly growing group of inborn errors of metabolism that result from defects in the synthesis of glycans. Glycosylation is a major post-translational protein modification and an estimated 2% of the human genome encodes proteins for glycosylation. The molecular bases for the current 60 disorders, affecting approximately 800 individuals, have been identified, many in the last 5 years. CDG should be considered in any multi-system syndrome or single tissue disorder not explained by the identification of another disorder. The initial clinical presentation varies significantly among individuals, even between affected siblings. However, two thirds of the known CDGs are associated with intellectual disabilities and most affected individuals need support services throughout their lives. Additional disorders of glycosylation are likely to be characterized over time. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Dev Disabil Res Rev 2013;17:211?225.

METHODS A retrospective study of pretreatment haematology and biochemistry in dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma or benign soft tissue tumours. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio were compared between the two groups. In dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma, the relationship of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio to histological tumour grade (I to III) was assessed. RESULTS In the dogs with soft tissue sarcoma (n=22), the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was significantly increased and the albumin-to-globulin ratio decreased compared to those with benign soft tissue tumours (n=14). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to globulin ratio were not useful as predictors of tumour grade in dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to globulin ratio may aid with diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. Further investigation into their prognostic implications is warranted.

AB  - Aneurysm of the jejunal artery (JA) is very uncommon with few specific symptoms, but can be a lethal entity. When at risk to rupture, it must be treated expeditiously to avoid mortality. We report a case of a 76-year-old male patient that underwent contrast-enhanced multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) which incidentally reveals a 12 mm saccular aneurysm of the third JA at the bifurcation of the first arcade. Patient underwent successful endovascular embolization using the isolation technique with the Amplatzer Vascular Plug 4. The patient's recovery was unremarkable and he was discharged on postoperative day 5. Follow-up MDCT reveals total exclusion of the saccular aneurysm of the third jejunal artery with patency of the distal branches.? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary Despite an increasing number of case reports published using computed tomography (CT) in foals only limited data on its diagnostic utility are available. Medical and imaging records of 10 foals that had a CT examination between May 2008 and December 2010 were retrieved and studied. Three out of 10 cases were examined for orthopaedic problems, 3 were referred for medical disorders, 3 for both orthopaedic and medical problems, and one case was presented for a follow-up of an abdominal mass. In this series CT was an accurate diagnostic tool in identifying abscesses, osteomyelitis, arthritis, physitis and fractures, bone ossification defects, intracranial haematomas and sinusitis. An indication for the best medical and/or surgical approach was obtained.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: To describe the presentation, clinical, ultrasonographic and endoscopic features associated with a defect in the tarsal sheath wall, to define the cavity created and to describe a method of treatment. Hypothesis: So called ?false thoroughpins? can be caused by defects in the tarsal sheath wall creating a one way valve effect, removal of which could be therapeutic. Methods: Case records and diagnostic images of horses with synoviocoeles associated with the tarsal sheath were reviewed retrospectively and follow-up information obtained. Results: Synoviocoeles were diagnosed in 15 horses. All were managed similarly and 10 horses had clinical resolution and returned to work. Conclusion: Terminology previously used to describe lesions involving the tarsal sheath does not define accurately the condition described and the term synoviocoele is recommended. Endoscopic enlargement of the sheath wall defect produced good clinical results in 10/15 horses. Potential relevance: Clinicians should include synoviocoele in the list of differential diagnoses of fluid filled cavities associated with the tarsal sheath and should consider endoscopic surgery as a treatment modality.

AB  - Objective To assess whether a correlation exists between newsworthiness (Altmetric score) and scientific impact markers, such as citation analysis, impact factors, and levels of evidence. Methods The top five most cited articles for the year 2014 and 2015 from the top 10 ranking urology journals (Scientific Impact Group) were identified. The top 50 articles each in 2014 and 2015 were identified from Altmetric support based on media activity (Media Impact Group). We determined the number of citations that these articles received in the scientific literature, and calculated correlations between citations with Altmetric scores. Results In the Scientific Impact Group, the mean number of citations per article was 37.6, and the most highly cited articles were oncology guidelines. The mean Altmetric score in these articles was 14.8. There was a weak positive correlation between citations and Altmetric score (rs = 0.35, 95% confidence interval 0.16?0.52, P < 0.001). In the Media Impact Group, the mean Altmetric score was 121.1 and most widely shared articles all related to sexual medicine. In this group, the mean number of citations was 9.7 and there was a weak negative correlation between Altmetric score and citations (rs = ?0.20, P = 0.046). Conclusion The top articles based on Altmetric scores were not highly cited, suggesting that publications receiving the most media attention may not be the most scientifically rigorous, or that this audience places greater value on different subjects than the scientific community.

AB  - Abstract A class of bioactive, stimuli-responsive co-joined interpenetrating networks of inherently conductive polymers and highly hydrated hydrogels are being developed for implantable biodevice interfaces and for electric field induced release of elutable drugs. A novel microfabricated multidisc electrode array biotransducer intended for trauma management has been coated with poly(HEMA)-polypyrrole and characterized by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry using ferrocene monocarboxylic acid (FcCOOH) as a probe molecule. Electrodeposition of polypyrrole (700?mV vs. Ag/AgCl) to 100 mC/cm2 onto the hydrogel coated microdisc electrode array resulted in large and unstable background currents relative to uncoated electrodes. Overoxidation of polypyrrole (0?1.2?V vs. Ag/AgCl, 20 cylces, 100?mV/s) eliminates background current. Dose-response curves with FcCOOH showed that the transducer has good reproducibility with molecules of facile electrochemical properties. Polypyrrole provides interference screening of endogenous interferents in biosensor applications with a 12:1 rejection ratio. GOx was immobilized via electropolymerization of polypyrrole into hydrogel coated MDEA 5037s to yield biotransducers with sensitivity of 0.045?µA?mM?1 cm?2. Changes to improve biotransducer sensitivity are proposed.
