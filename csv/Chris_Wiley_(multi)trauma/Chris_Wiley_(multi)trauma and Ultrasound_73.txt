AB  - Reasons for performing study There are currently no studies detailing cardiac troponin I (cTnI) release and clearance in normal horses post exercise using an analytically validated assay. These data are essential for selecting appropriate sampling times in equine athletes with suspected myocardial damage. Objective To plot the magnitude and time course of cTnI release and clearance, using a validated cTnI assay, after maximal effort. Study design Descriptive longitudinal study. Methods Five clinically normal Standardbred racehorses in full race training were included in the study. Physical examinations were performed on subjects and blood samples were taken via jugular venipuncture pre-exercise. Horses were exercised in harness at race intensity in groups on a training track. A second blood sample was taken immediately post exercise and an intravenous catheter was then placed in a jugular vein. Hourly blood samples were taken for 24?h. All samples were collected in red top serum Vacutainer? tubes and allowed to clot for 30?min before being centrifuged and serum harvested. Serum samples were stored at ?80°C until analysis. All samples were analysed using the Abbott ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitivity cTnI? assay. Results Mean resting cTnI level was 1.33?±?0.6?ng/l (range, 0.82?2.33?ng/l). All horses exhibited an increase in cTnI level after exercise with peak elevation occurring 2?6?h post exercise (mean, 4.6?±?1.7?h). Mean peak increase in cTnI level was 11.96?±?9.41?ng/l (range, 1.72?23.76?ng/l). All horses returned to baseline levels within 24?h. Conclusions All horses experienced an increase in cTnI post exercise, with the peak occurring 2?6?h post exercise. Further studies are needed to determine the significance of these increases.

AB  - ObjectiveTo determine the number and causes of deaths of Australian citizens who died overseas in a 12-month period. DesignRetrospective survey of deaths reported to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by Australian embassies, high commissions and consulates for the period July 1992 to June 1993. Data on Australians travelling overseas were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. ResultsDuring the year 1992-1993, 2 299 500 Australians travelled overseas for less than 12 months (short term travellers), with an estimated mean trip duration of 6.3 weeks. Another 65 450 left for more than 12 months (long term travellers), and 27 910 left permanently (residents). Of the 421 recorded deaths, 289 were in short term travellers, 108 in long term travellers/residents and 24 in members of work parties. The annual crude mortality rate for short term travellers and work party members was estimated at about 0.1%. Men outnumbered women almost 4:1. Death rates increased with age, reflecting underlying medical problems in older travellers, with heart disease being the leading cause (146 deaths, 35%). Fatal trauma predominated in younger people. Accidents, mainly in traffic, accounted for 77 deaths (18%) and infections for 10 (2.4%), including two cases of malaria. Death rates varied between geographical regions, with New Zealand being the safest destination. ConclusionsThe risk of an Australian dying while travelling overseas is probably little different from that while staying home. The low level of fatal infections may result from preventive measures. Travellers should be aware of the danger of accidents, particularly traffic accidents, while overseas.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the background, potential risks, complications, special considerations, and prognosis of gastric foreign body retrieval in dogs and cats, along with a few complication examples. Gastric foreign bodies are a common emergency in veterinary medicine and require appropriate case management for the most successful outcomes. A standard gastroduodenoscope is utilized to visualize the foreign body. A wide variety of instruments including baskets, nets, graspers, snares and forceps can be utilized for retrieval. Every endoscopic foreign body retrieval should include a duodenoscopy, as there could be an additional foreign body in the duodenum. The most frustrating aspect of gastric foreign body retrieval involves resistance that is encountered at the lower esophageal stricture (LES) that continually dislodges the foreign body from engagement. This can be minimized by selecting and instrument that complements the foreign body and provides the most rigid, firm grasp possible, minimizing slipping.

AB  - Abstract Introduction: Pleural effusions are rare in the neonate and may be associated to several clinical conditions. Only a few series of pleural effusions in the fetus and newborn are described in the literature. Aim: This study was undertaken to determine more accurately the causes and prognostic significance of pleural effusions in a population of high-risk neonates. Materials and methods: A retrospective chart review of 62 neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of six medical centers in the north of Portugal, between 1997 and 2004, that presented the diagnosis of pleural effusion. Results: 33M/29F newborns; preterms 47 (76%); GA 33 (25?40) wk; BW 1830 (660?4270) g; C-section 39 (63%). Pleural effusions were congenital in 20 (32%) newborns and acquired in 42 (68%). Congenital pleural effusions occurred as fetal hydrops in 11 (18%) patients and as chylothorax in 9 (15%). In four cases of hydrops, the cause was a congenital chylothorax. Congenital chylothorax (n=13) was the most common (65%) congenital pleural effusion in this study. The incidence of congenital chylothorax was 1:8.600 deliveries and male:female ratio was 2:1. Mortality occurred in five newborns due to pulmonary hypoplasia. Traumatic (iatrogenic) were the most frequent (n=31) acquired pleural effusions. These included 8 (13%) cases of hemothorax and 8 (13%) cases of total parenteral nutrition leakage. Pleural effusions after intra-thoracic surgery were mainly (79%) chylothoraces. There were 11 (26%) non-iatrogenic acquired pleural effusions. No mortality was associated with acquired pleural effusions. Conclusions: Congenital pleural effusions usually occur as hydrops or congenital chylothorax. Traumatic (iatrogenic) are the most frequent acquired pleural effusions in a tertiary NICU. Pleural effusions after intra-thoracic surgery are mainly chylothoraces. Non-iatrogenic acquired pleural effusions are associated to several clinical conditions, and mortality is usually associated to the underlying condition.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Colic remains a life-threatening condition in the horse. Ischaemia and reperfusion following correction of small intestinal strangulation may produce oxidative stress. The ability to withstand oxidative stress depends on antioxidant levels and may be linked to horse survival. Objectives To measure peripheral antioxidant levels in horses undergoing exploratory laparotomy with small intestinal strangulation. Study design Case?control study. Methods Blood and plasma were collected from horses undergoing exploratory laparotomy for small intestinal strangulation and stored at ?80°C. Controls involved non-colic horses. Total plasma glutathione was measured spectrophotometrically at 412?nm using the 5,5?-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Ellman's reagent) reaction. Samples containing scavenger (to remove reduced glutathione, GSH) were used to measure oxidised glutathione (GSSG). Glutathione reductase (GR) activity (u/l) was measured as the rate of GSH production at 412?nm. Glutathione peroxidise (GPx) activity (u/l) was measured as the change in optical density (340?nm) following the consumption of NADPH after GSSG production. All assays were purchased from BioAssay Systems (Hayward, California). Clinical data including arterial blood gas analysis were collected on admission. Results Glutathione reductase activity in horses with strangulating small intestinal lesions was significantly reduced compared to control horses (12.2?±?1.1?u/l vs. 15.9?±?0.8?u/l, P?=?0.03, n?=?6) whereas GPx activity did not significantly differ between colic and control horses (155.7?±?48.7?u/l vs. 167.3?±?30.1?u/l, P?=?0.84, n?=?6). Total glutathione, reduced or oxidised glutathione did not differ significantly between control and colic horses. A positive correlation existed between GR activity and Ca2+ (r?=?0.93) and K+ (r?=?0.75) whereas a strong negative correlation was present between GR activity and HCO3? (r?=??0.92) and PaCO2 (r?=??0.96). Conclusions Reduced plasma glutathione reductase activity with small intestinal strangulation indicates oxidative stress and may be related to systemic electrolyte/bicarbonate abnormalities.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Selective 5-HT4 receptor agonists such as prucalopride are used as human prokinetics, since activation of 5-HT4 receptors on intestinal cholinergic neurons facilitates acetylcholine release. 5-HT4 receptors, linked to adenylyl cyclase, act via generation of cAMP. None of the 4 in vitro studies on 5-HT in horses provided evidence for neuronal 5-HT4 receptors, but none used the protocol as described in human studies [1?4]. Objectives To investigate whether functional 5-HT4 receptors are present in the equine small intestine. Study design and methods In vitro organ bath set up, applying electrical field stimulation (EFS) in longitudinal and circular smooth muscle strips. Results Results were similar in both muscle layers. In the presence of 0.3?mmol/l NG-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and 0.3??mol/l apamine, excluding effects of the inhibitory transmitters NO and ATP, EFS induced voltage-dependent on-contractions; these were neurogenic as they were abolished by 3??mol/l tetrodotoxin. At a voltage inducing 50% of the maximal amplitude, the submaximal EFS-induced contractions were cholinergic as atropine (1??mol/l) abolished them. Prucalopride (0.3??mol/l) did not increase the amplitude of these submaximal EFS-induced contractions. Even in the presence of the nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX, previously shown to enhance the effect of neuronal 5-HT4 receptors by inhibiting breakdown of their 2nd messenger cAMP [5], prucalopride (3??mol/l) had no influence. Also 5-HT (10??mol/l), a full agonist at 5-HT4 receptors, tested in the presence of methysergide and granisetron to exclude interaction with other 5-HT receptor subtypes, did not enhance EFS-induced submaximal contractions. Conclusions There is no evidence for presence of 5-HT4 receptors on the cholinergic neurons of the equine small intestine. These results question the application of 5-HT4 prokinetic drugs in horses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Infrared imaging is becoming popular as an aid to traditional diagnostic tools, its repeatability under practically relevant conditions is still discussed. Objectives We hypothesise that time of day, ambient temperature and relative humidity affect thermography readings, and that there is no difference between values from left and right side. Study design Repeated thermography in a convenience sample. Methods Fifteen sound horses were thermographically imaged at 3 time points in the same day (08.00, 12.00 and 16.00?h). Images were taken of the following regions: neck, carpus, distolateral thoracic limbs (cranial and tendon areas), thoracolumbar, pelvis, hock and pelvic limb tendons. Relative humidity and ambient temperature were recorded for each session. Results There was a significant difference between the temperature readings during the 3 imaging sessions in all areas (Friedman and Kruskal?Wallis; all P<0.014). Ambient temperature and relative humidity correlated with thermography readings in the caudal imaging areas (P<0.008 [temperature], P<0.032 [humidity]) of the horses, with an exception of one hock reading, but not in all cranial areas (P<0.365 [temperature], P<0.992 [humidity]) (Spearman's Rho). All but 2 regions (minimum values in the carpus and thoracic tendon areas in the morning session, (P?=?0.033, 0.034) did not show significant difference between left and right sides at the same time of day (all P>0.057). Conclusions Time of day, ambient temperature and relative humidity must be considered when using infrared imaging. Variations between the left and right sides of the horse can occur and should be considered during the analysis of pathological asymmetry.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an electrophysiological technique used to elicit motor evoked potentials (MMEPs) to evaluate the functional integrity of the descending motor fibres in the spinal cord. Successful application of the technique was reported in horses with spinal cord compression. However, limited data are available on the correlation of TMS with histopathological changes. Objectives To determine sensitivity of TMS for assessing the integrity of the spinal cord in horses with compressive lesions of the spinal cord. Study design Case series. Methods The study was conducted on 6 horses with spinal ataxia grade III-V/V admitted to the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University. The horses underwent TMS, radiography of the cervical or thoracolumbar vertebral column, and myelography (4/6). All horses were subjected to euthanasia and the spinal cord examined histopathologically. Results In 5/6 horses MMEPs with abnormal onset latencies in both extensor carpi radialis muscles and cranial tibialis muscles were recorded, suggesting a cervical spinal cord lesion. Radiography revealed cervical vertebral malformation (4/5) with cervical vertebral canal stenosis (3/5) and tumour/osteomyelitis (1/5). In 1/6 horse MMEPs with normal onset latencies in extensor carpi radialis muscles and prolonged onset latencies in tibialis cranialis muscles were recorded, suggesting a thoracolumbar spinal cord lesion. Radiography revealed deformation of the 7th and 8th thoracic vertebrae. Myelography showed reduction in dural diameter and dorsal contrast column (4/4). Histopathological examination of the spinal cord confirmed compressive type lesions in all 6 horses with degenerative changes in the white matter of all funiculi, ballooning of myelin sheets, swollen axons, loss of axons and astroglial activation. Conclusions In this case series abnormal function of descending motor pathways as registered by TMS showed 100% sensitivity with the histopathological characteristics of compressive lesions in the spinal cord, but the number of horses is limited and further research is warranted.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Limited information exists on distribution of local anaesthetic solution following palmar digital nerve blocks. Objectives To demonstrate potential distribution of local anaesthetic solution following perineural injection of the palmar digital nerves using 2 different volumes of contrast medium and 2 different injection sites. Study design Experimental. Methods Twelve mature horses were used. Perineural injection of the palmar digital nerves were performed at the level of or 2?cm proximal to the proximal aspect of the ipsilateral ungular cartilage, using 1.5 or 2.5?ml radiodense contrast medium. In total 96 injections were performed. Four standard radiographic views of the pastern were obtained immediately after injections and 10 and 20?min later. Images were analysed subjectively and objectively. Results After distal injections, the contrast medium was more localised around the injection site; after proximal injections the contrast patch had greater proximal-distal length. The greatest proximal diffusion was to 31.7% of the length of the proximal phalanx (from distal) after distal injections and to 70% after proximal injections. The larger volume resulted in significantly greater proximal diffusion than the smaller volume at the distal, but not at the proximal injection site (P<0.01). There was significant proximal diffusion with time after proximal and distal injections (P<0.01). In most limbs numerous radiopaque lines of various thickness extended proximally from the contrast patches; subjectively, their number and thickness were greater at the distal injection site. Conclusions Palmar digital nerve blocks at the level of the ungular cartilage using ≤2.5?ml local anaesthetic solution may improve proximal interphalangeal joint and pastern region pain. If using a more proximal site, distal fetlock region pain may be improved. Due to diffusion into lymphatic vessels, too small a volume at the distal injection site may not provide sufficient analgesia.

AB  - Reasons for performing study A quantifiable measure of muscle activity related to the cervical spine may provide further understanding and evidence based support for chiropractic techniques. Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a noninvasive method of measuring muscle activity of the splenius muscle when the horse is at rest. Objectives To determine if there is a relationship between objective measurable muscle parameters and misalignments and muscle tension in the equine cervical spine. Study design Controlled paired randomised study. Methods Privately owned horses (n?=?14), of mixed sex, age and mean height 157.8?cm were selected and assigned a group by matching work, management regime, age, sex and breed. The treatment group (n?=?7) underwent manual chiropractic treatment following palpation. The control group underwent palpation only. A Delsys 4 sensor system was used for data collection. Probes were positioned on the muscle halfway between C1/C2 joint and the crest on the left and right sides, between the tendon insertion and the motor point to maximise signals. sEMG readings were taken at immediately before (0) and after palpation (PP) and 30?min later (30). Data were tested for normality and variance by one-way ANOVA and paired t test. Results Post treatment, there was a significant decrease (P<0.01) in sEMG activity for treatment group at 0 to 30 and PP to 30. There was a significant decrease (P<0.05) in sEMG for right side for treatment group at 0 to 30 and PP to 30. There were no such significant effects for the control group. The majority (83%) of horses had atlas rotation and tilt to the right. Conclusions This preliminary study supports use of sEMG as a means of assessing muscle activity of equines and suggests a statistically significant reduction in splenius muscle activity is observed following manual chiropractic treatment although the benefit to the horse is unknown.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Andalusian horses have been proposed as a breed predisposed to equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) phenotype [1] because they are prone to exhibiting regional, generalised adiposity and tendency to laminitis [2]. Insulin dysregulation represents the main pathophysiological cause for all the features of EMS, however there are no epidemiological studies in this breed. Objective To assess insulin dysregulation through insulin proxies in Andalusian horses with different levels of obesity. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods One hundred and sixty-four Andalusians (78 stallions and 86 mares, 2?15 years) were scored for overall (body condition score, BCS) and neck (cresty neck score, CNS) adiposity. Grain concentrate was withheld for 12?h before sampling. Blood samples were collected between 06.00?10.00?h for basal glucose, insulin concentrations, RISQI and MIRG proxies calculation. Conditions were defined as: obese horses (Ob), BCS?≥?7; cresty neck horses (CN), CNS?≥?3; hyperinsulinaemia, insulin ≥20??u/ml; low insulin sensitivity, RISQI<0.32[mu/l]?0.5 and increased insulin secretory response, MIRG>5.6muinsulin2/[10.l.mgglucose]. Regarding BCS 2 groups were created: Ob and non-Ob. These groups were subdivided depending on CNS: with CN and without it (nonCN). Ob-nonCN group (n?=?2) was excluded for the statistics due to the low number of horses. Results Of the horses studied, 26.8% were Ob-CN, 42.1% were nonOb-CN and 31.1% were nonOb-nonCN. Ob horses presented higher insulin levels (P?=?0.034) and lower RISQI values (P?=?0.019) than all nonOb horses. When CN was considered, only RISQI was lower (P?=?0.015) in Ob-CN group respect to nonOb-nonCN, however nonOb-CN group does not differ from the other 2 groups. Furthermore, the percentage of Ob-CN horses with hyperinsulinaemia (2.3%), abnormal RISQI (4.5%) and MIRG (9.1%) was very low. Conclusions These results suggest that in Andalusians, increased adiposity was not clearly associated to insulin dysregulation and, similar to human beings, may coexist as a metabolically healthy but obese phenotype.

AB  - Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is a descriptor for the clinical finding of congenital fixation of multiple joints. We present a consanguineous healthy couple with two pregnancies described with AMC due to characteristic findings on ultrasonography of fixated knee extension and reduced fetal movement at the gestational age of 13 weeks?+?2 days and 12 weeks?+?4 days. Both pregnancies were terminated and postmortem examinations were performed. The postmortem examinations confirmed AMC and suggested a diagnosis of centronuclear myopathy (CNM) due to characteristic histological findings in muscle biopsies. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on all four individuals and the outcome was filtered by application of multiple filtration parameters satisfying a recessive inheritance pattern. Only one gene, ECEL1, was predicted damaging and had previously been associated with neuromuscular disease or AMC. The variant found ECEL1 is a missense mutation in a highly conserved residue and was predicted pathogenic by prediction software. The finding expands the molecular basis of congenital contractures and the phenotypic spectrum of ECEL1 mutations. The histological pattern suggestive of CNM in the fetuses can expand the spectrum of genes causing CNM, as we propose that mutations in ECEL1 can cause CNM or a condition similar to this. Further investigation of this is needed and we advocate that future patients with similar clinical presentation or proven ECEL1 mutations are examined with muscle biopsy. Secondly, this study illustrates the great potential of the clinical application of WES in couples with recurrent abortions or stillborn neonates. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Aim:? To assess urinary bladder volume in a noninvasive manner using a portable and modified device that measures electrical impedance. Methods:? A novel method was attempted to measure electrical impedance and indirect bladder volume, and these data were used to calculate the actual bladder volume. Results:? An increase of 0.01?V in the abdominal voltage was observed with every 50?mL increase in the amount of physiological saline infused into the bladder. Conclusions:? It is a simple procedure and can be used by technical staff or the patients themselves to obtain continuous, real-time urinary bladder volume data.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Detection of residual tumor during resection of glial brain tumors remains a challenge because of a low inherent contrast of adjacent edematous brain, the surrounding infiltration zone, and the solid tumor. Therefore, new technologies that may facilitate an intraoperative analysis of the tissue at the resection edge are of great interest to neurosurgeons. Materials and Methods For ex vivo imaging of gliomas in a mouse model and human biopsy specimens of brain tumors and nervous system tissue we have used a time-domain Sirius 713 Tomograph with a central wavelength of 1,310 nm and a coherence length of 15 µm equipped with a mono mode fiber and a modified optical coherence tomography (OCT) adapter containing a lens system for imaging at a working distance of 2.5 cm. A spectral-domain tomograph using 840 nm and 930 nm superluminescence diodes (SLD) with a central wavelength of 900 nm was used as a second imaging modelity. Results Both time-domain and spectral-domain coherence tomography delineated normal brain, the infiltration zone and solid tumor in murine intracerebral gliomas. Histological evaluation of H&E sections parallel to the optical plain demonstrated that tumor areas of less than a millimeter could be detected and that not only solid tumor, but also brain invaded by a low-density single tumor cells produced an OCT signal different from normal brain. Spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) demonstrated a significantly more detailed microstructure of tumor and normal brain up to a tissue depth of 1.5?2.0 mm, whereas the interpretation of time-domain OCT (TD-OCT) was difficult at a tissue depth >1.0 mm. Because of rapid scanning times SD-OCT data could be acquired as 3D data maps, which allowed a multi-planar analysis of the tumor to brain interface. Similar to our findings in experimental gliomas, images of human nervous system tissue acquired using SD-OCT showed a characteristic signal of normal brain tissue and a detailed microstructure of tumor parenchyma. Conclusion Spectral-domain OCT of experimental gliomas and human brain tumor specimens differentiates solid tumor, diffusely invaded brain tissue, and adjacent normal brain based on microstructure and B-scan signal characteristics. In conjunction with the rapid image acquisition rates of SD-OCT, this technology carries the potential of a novel intraoperative imaging tool for the detection of residual tumor and guidance of neurosurgical tumor resections.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Ultrasonography is associated with a high error rate in the evaluation of soft tissue masses. The purposes of this study were to examine the nature of the diagnostic errors and to identify areas in which reporting could be improved. Methods Patients who had soft tissue tumours and received ultrasonography during a 10-year period (1999?2009) were identified from a local tumour registry. The sonographic and pathological diagnoses were categorised as either ?benign? or ?non-benign?. The accuracy of ultrasonography was assessed by correlating the sonographic with the pathological diagnostic categories. Recommendations from radiologists, where offered, were assessed for their appropriateness in the context of the pathological diagnosis. Results One hundred seventy-five patients received ultrasonography, of which 60 had ?non-benign? lesions and 115 had ?benign? lesions. Ultrasonography correctly diagnosed 35 and incorrectly diagnosed seven of the 60 ?non-benign? cases, and did not suggest a diagnosis in 18 cases. Most of the diagnostic errors related to misdiagnosing soft tissue tumours as haematomas (four out of seven). Recommendations for further management were offered by the radiologists in 144 cases, of which 52 had ?non-benign? pathology. There were eight ?non-benign? cases where no recommendation was offered, and the sonographic diagnosis was either incorrect or unavailable. Conclusions Ultrasonography lacks accuracy in the evaluation of soft tissue masses. Ongoing education is required to improve awareness of the limitations with its use. These limitations should be highlighted to the referrers, especially those who do not have specific training in this area.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Inflammation is key in the development of post operative ileus in rodents, with a similar pathogenesis likely occurring in other species. Dexamethasone reduces inflammation and therefore could help reduce post operative ileus in the horse. Objectives To determine if dexamethasone reduces post operative ileus in horses with small intestinal disease, and assess the effect on incisional health and short-term survival. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Fifteen horses that underwent small intestinal resection and anastomosis were given 0.1?mg/kg bwt dexamethasone intravenously during surgery (DEX). Data from a comparable number of horses that did not receive dexamethasone (NoDEX) was collected retrospectively and sequentially. Horses were matched for the type of resection performed. Fisher's Exact and Student's t tests were used for data analysis. Results There was no significant difference in the amount of nasogastric reflux (litres) (DEX 8.06?±?17.12, NoDEX 10.02?±?24.03, P?=?0.39) produced or in the number of horses that produced nasogastric reflux post operatively. There was no difference in survival to discharge. The severity of incisional discharge/infection was significantly different between groups when scored 0?3 (0 being no discharge and 3 being severe discharge/infection), (P?=?0.01), in favour of DEX (2/15 horses affected) vs. NoDEX (7/15). Conclusions Dexamethasone did not appear to have a beneficial effect on the incidence of post-operative ileus. Administration of a single dose of dexamethasone does not appear to have a detrimental effect on short-term survival or on incisional complications.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Infiltrative disease of the intestine is an important cause of weight loss in the horse. Infiltration of inflammatory or neoplastic cells into the intestinal wall and intestinal fibrosis cause changes in the integrity of the intestinal wall. This may lead to altered intestinal permeability which can be measured using the contrast medium iohexol. Objectives To determine if iohexol intestinal permeability, as evaluated by serum iohexol concentration, could be used to differentiate between healthy horses and horses with infiltrative disease of the large colon. Study design Prospective non-randomised controlled clinical trial. Methods Six healthy adult horses and 4 horses with chronic infiltrative disease of the large colon were used in the study. Infiltrative disease was confirmed on post mortem in all cases, and included alimentary lymphoma and mycobacterial granulomatous enterocolitis. Following a 16-h fast, each horse was dosed with 1.0?ml/kg bwt of iohexol as a 10% solution via nasogastric intubation. Blood samples were collected at 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420 and 480?min after dosing. Iohexol concentration was determined using HPLC-UV and the differences between the groups were analysed with a repeated measures ANOVA. Results There was a statistically significant difference in iohexol serum concentration between the diseased and nondiseased horses (P?=?0.001). The overall difference in the mean iohexol concentration between the 2 groups was 6.07 (95% CI 3.19?8.96)??g/ml, however there appeared to be a trend towards increasing difference at later time points (240, 300, 360?min). Conclusions The iohexol permeability test has potential as a diagnostic tool for estimation of intestinal permeability in horses with infiltrative intestinal disease. Further studies are warranted to determine whether the test can be used to determine the site of intestinal pathology, predict the prognosis and potentially evaluate the response to treatment.

AB  - Reasons for performing study To determine whether horses could become infected with cyathostomins when bedded in deep litter straw. Objectives The specific objective of the study was to determine whether cyathostomin eggs could hatch and develop to infective larval stages on straw bedding. Study design Experimental study. Methods Four horticultural incubators were set up to simulate 3 straw bedding scenarios, and one grass turf control. Faeces were placed on 12 plots, and larval recoveries performed on samples of straw/grass over a 17-day period. The plots within incubators A, B, and C contained dry straw, watered straw, and deep litter straw, respectively. Plot 1 of each incubator contained a faecal pat of a horse that tested negative for strongyle eggs ? these were to serve as negative control plots. Plots 2 and 3 of each incubator contained a faecal pat from horses that had average faecal worm egg counts (FWEC) of 269 epg and 921 epg, respectively. A thermostat within each incubator was set to maintain an environmental temperature of approximately 20°C. Results No L3 larvae were recovered from the control plots of each incubator, and none were recovered from any of the plots within Incubator A. L3 larvae were first detected on plots 2 and 3 of Incubator B on Day 8, and on plot 3 of incubators C and D on Day 10. Conclusions It is evident that equine Cyathostominae can develop to infective L3 larvae on straw bedding, but only when the straw is moist. Therefore, it may be speculated that a horse bedded in deep litter straw may become infected by ingesting the infective L3 larvae contaminating the straw. Ethical animal research:?Not applicable.
