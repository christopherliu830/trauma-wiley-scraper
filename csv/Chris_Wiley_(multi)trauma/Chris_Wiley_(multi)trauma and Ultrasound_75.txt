AB  - Background Acute myocardial infarctions (AMI) continue to be common in the United States. Mechanical complications of AMI can lead to cardiogenic shock (CS) and death. The aim of this study was to review the cases of papillary muscle ruptures in the setting of myocardial infarctions at a tertiary care center, with a focus on the clinical presentation and echocardiographic diagnosis. Methods This was a retrospective study from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2014. In all, 22 patients with AMI and papillary muscle rupture (AMI-PMR) who had surgical intervention were identified. Results The average age was 70 (±11) with 16 (73%) males. Six patients presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) and all underwent emergent revascularization with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) prior to the diagnosis of AMI-PMR. The other 16 patients presented with a non-STEMI. In total, 17 (77%) of the 22 patients were diagnosed with an AMI-PMR within 7 days from their onset of symptoms. In all, 12 patients (55%) had anterolateral papillary muscle ruptures (ALPMR), and the other 10 had posteromedial papillary muscle ruptures (PMPMR). Ruptures were complete in 10 patients (45%). Patients presented with pulmonary edema early (<7 days) more commonly than late (>14 days). Transthoracic echocardiography was able to demonstrate severe mitral regurgitation in 86% and a definitive or suggestive diagnosis in 93%. All 22 patients survived to operative management, and the overall in-hospital mortality rate was 9%. Conclusion In conclusion, ischemic papillary muscle ruptures continue to occur, but with prompt diagnosis by echocardiography and rapid surgical management, the mortality rate continues to decline.

AB  - Venous air embolism entering via the ventral internal vertebral venous plexus was suspected during thoracic spinal surgery in two dogs. In both cases, air was seen bubbling from a pool of blood on the floor of the vertebral canal accompanied by sudden cardiopulmonary disturbances: low end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure, tachycardia and reduction in oxygen in the blood. One dog became dyspnoeic and one died.

AB  - Objectives To retrospectively evaluate the clinical behaviour and immunophenotype of lymphoma of the rectum in dogs. Methods Eleven dogs diagnosed with lymphoma of the rectum on histopathology were retrospectively reviewed. Immunohistochemistry with CD3 and CD79a antibodies was performed at diagnosis or retrospectively. Results Treatment protocol varied with six dogs undergoing surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, two received chemotherapy after only incisional biopsy, one had surgical resection only, one was treated symptomatically and one dog was not treated. Chemotherapy treatment consisted of either a -low-dose COP (cyclophosphamide - prednisolone - vincristine) protocol (four dogs) or a six-week CHOP-based (cyclophosphamide - vincristine - -prednisolone - anthracycline) protocol (four dogs). Dogs that received chemotherapy lived significantly longer than dogs that did not receive chemotherapy (2352 versus 70 days). Median survival time was not reached, and there was an overall mean survival time of 1697 days. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 10 of 11 samples, and was consistent with B-cell -lymphoma in all cases. Clinical Significance Canine lymphoma of the rectum is associated with a favourable prognosis. Immunohistochemical evaluation of these lesions was consistent with B-cell lymphoma in all cases in which it was examined.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on the interpretation of radiographs and blood tests from a rheumatological perspective. Multi-system disease implies concurrent signs and symptoms in multiple organ systems. Its identification is often followed by tests to exclude infections and malignancy since their treatment and prognosis varies. The diagnostic pathway then goes down the route of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs). SARDs include conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and connective tissue diseases like systemic lupus erythematosis, mixed connective tissue disease, Sjogren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis, anti-nuclear cytoplasmic antibody associated vasculitides and so on. This diagnosis often involves treatment with potent immunosuppressive drugs which, if an infection has not been excluded can cause serious harm. Focusing on the bones, one will have to look for evidence of demineralisation, erosions, joint space narrowing and new bone formation, for example osteophytes.

AB  - Summary The use of contrast media in computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasing in horses. These contrast-enhanced imaging techniques provide improved tissue delineation and evaluation, thereby expanding diagnostic capabilities. While generally considered safe, not all contrast media exhibit the same safety profiles. The safety of contrast media use and descriptions of adverse events occurring in horses are sparsely reported. This review summarises the reported evidence of contrast media use and adverse events that occur in horses, with added contribution from other veterinary species and studies in man for comparison. This comprehensive data set empowers equine clinicians to develop use and monitoring strategies when working with contrast media. Finally, it summarises the current state-of-the-art and highlights the potential applications of contrast-enhanced CT and MRI for assessment of diseased or injured equine tissues, as well as (patho)physiological processes.

AB  - Abstract Aims: Comparative surgical audit is increasingly important, although fraught due to the difficulty of risk adjusted analysis. The surgical risk score was developed to provide surgeon-independent risk-adjusted mortality in general surgery using readily available clinical indices (CEPOD grade of operative urgency, BUPA grade of operative magnitude and ASA grade of patient comorbidities). Methods: Prospective data collection from 4308 patients admitted under the care of three general surgeons (May 1997?October 1999) created an initial data set of 3144 procedures with 134 deaths. Each procedure was scored by summation of linear scales allocated to CEPOD, BUPA and ASA grades to devise a surgical risk scale (SRS) ranging from 3 to 14. Multi-variate logistic regression analysis involving the three variables and uni-variate analysis of the SRS scores were undertaken. Receiver operating characteristic and calibration curves were formulated. This process was validated on another data set (2780 patients) derived from all admissions to the same surgeons (November 1999?December 2000). Results: Uni-variate logistic analysis of the SRS score revealed it to be significantly predictive of death (? = 0.84, P < 0.001). The SRS score did not over predict mortality for low risk procedures. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.931 for the initial data set and 0.951 for the validation set. Conclusion: The SRS is easy to use, formulate and interpret. It has been validated as a tool for risk-adjusted comparative audit in a population of general surgical patients.

A double-blind randomized multi-centre clinical study. Subjects:? Ninety-six patients complaining of at least five acute aphthous ulcers were randomized to two intervention groups. Sample size was calculated using an alpha error of 0.05 and beta of 0.20 Materials and methods:? Participants were randomly assigned to receive 5% amlexanox or a 0.05% clobetasol propionate magistral preparation. Observers at the participating institutions were previously trained to standardize clinical diagnosis and data recollection. Ulcer size and pain were measured on treatment days 0, 2 and 5. Results:? No significant differences were found between the two groups studied in any of the studied variables at baseline. Both treatment medications significantly reduced pain magnitude and the index ulcer's size on days 2 and 5 compared with day 0 without adverse reactions (within groups differences). No statistical differences between groups of the study medications were found. Conclusion:? The two treatments applied had similar effectiveness as they both relieved pain and reduced the size of recurrent aphthous ulcers.

AB  - Objectives To prospectively examine durability of long-term outcomes in sialendoscopy-assisted salivary duct surgery (SASDS) in chronic obstructive sialadenitis without sialolithiasis (COSWS). Methods A prospective cohort study of adult patients with COSWS who completed Chronic Obstructive Sialadenitis Symptoms (COSS) Questionnaire prior to and at 3 months and 1 year following SASDS. COSS scores scaled to 0 to 100 were analyzed by statistically significant improvements and previously published ranges corresponding to complete, partial, and nonresolution of symptoms. Results Twenty-nine patients with COSWS affecting 41 glands had statistically significant improvements in COSS scores at 3 months following SASDS. These improvements usually were sustained at 1 year, supporting durability of treatment effect over time. A majority of cases (30 of 41, 73%) achieved at least a partial resolution of sialadenitis symptoms (COSS score?≤?25) at 1-year follow-up. Symptom improvement after SASDS was noted in 14 of 18 (78%) glands with radioiodine-induced sialadenitis (RAI-IS). The highest proportion of persistent or recurrent disease at 1-year post-SASDS was found in autoimmune sialadenitis (2 of 4, 50%) and glands with proximal or multifocal stenoses (6 of 12, 50%). At 1 year, distal duct stenoses achieved a significantly higher proportion of partial or complete symptom resolution (18 of 21, 86%) than cases with proximal or multifocal stenoses (6 of 12, 50%; P?=?0.044). Conclusions SASDS is effective in reducing symptoms in duct stenosis and RAI-IS, usually with durable treatment benefits at long-term follow-up. Distal stenoses appear to be more amenable to sialendoscopic treatment, achieving greater symptom reduction than proximal/multifocal stenoses. Additional larger multi-center studies are needed to further characterize risk factors for COSWS refractory to SASDS. Level of Evidence 2 Laryngoscope, 129:890?896, 2019

AB  - Abstract Objective To study the joint distribution and 2-year outcome of patients with recent-onset monoarthritis. Methods Adult patients with clinically apparent monoarthritis of ≤16 weeks? duration were included in a multi-center 2-year longitudinal study. Clinical characteristics, joint distribution, development of chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease (CIRD), as well as classification according to the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (2010 RA criteria) were studied. Predictors for development of CIRD were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression analyses. Results The knee (49.3%), ankle (16.7%) and wrist (14.1%) were the most frequently affected joints among the 347 included patients. Ninety-one patients (26.2%) developed CIRD during follow-up; 21 (6.1%) were diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and 16 (4.6%) with psoriatic arthritis. Longer duration of joint swelling, joint localization, and ACPA- and RF positivity were independent predictors of CIRD. Six of 58 (10.3%) patients with ankle monoarthritis and 21 of 49 (42.9%) patients with wrist monoarthritis developed CIRD during follow-up. The 2010 RA criteria captured all patients diagnosed with seropositive RA at an early stage, mostly within three months. Conclusion Approximately one-fourth of patients with recent-onset monoarthritis developed CIRD over 2 years. Patients presenting with ankle arthritis rarely developed CIRD, whereas patients presenting with wrist arthritis more frequently did so. Longer duration of joint swelling and ACPA- and RF positivity were also predictive of CIRD. Our findings facilitate early identification of monoarthritis patients with unfavorable prognosis.

On admission the mare was in poor body condition, with severe inspiratory and expiratory dyspnoea associated with severe hypoxaemia and marked tachycardia. Wheezes were auscultated. A pulmonary biopsy revealed fibrosis of about 40% of the parenchyma. Following an episode of atrial fibrillation, an echocardiogram was carried out which revealed signs of pulmonary hypertension, consistent with cor pulmonale. Despite the lack of aetiologic explanation for the primary pulmonary disease, the general condition of the mare improved with the administration of high-dosed corticoids and antimicrobial therapy.

AB  - Summary Renal transplantation is an established treatment for end-stage renal failure in cats. Short- and long-term complications are relatively frequent. Ureteral complications, particularly ureteral obstruction, occur relatively frequently after feline renal transplantation. Delayed graft function in human renal transplant recipients is associated with an increased incidence of acute rejection, poor long-term graft function, and reduced survival. Allografts with delayed graft function should have minimal renal pelvic dilation (a sign of ureteral obstruction), good graft perfusion, and a normal resistive index. After renal transplantation, lifelong immunosuppressive therapy is needed to maintain the allograft and prevent rejection. In cats, the standard immunosuppressive protocol consists of microemulsified cyclosporine and prednisolone. Postoperative infections are relatively common in immunosuppressed feline renal allograft recipients. In cats with infections, appropriate medical therapy should be initiated. Cyclosporine concentration should be carefully monitored and adjusted.

AB  - Background: Serous effusions in chronic pancreatitis are infrequent but persistent. These occur usually as a consequence of internal pancreatic fistulae and commonly involve the pleural cavity or peritoneum. Methods: To assess strategies in operative management, the records of 12 patients who underwent surgery for internal pancreatic fistula with underlying chronic pancreatitis were reviewed retrospectively. Seven patients had pancreatic ductal calculi. Three cases underwent external drainage. Three cases with leaking pseudocysts underwent cystojejunostomy-en-Y. Three cases with ductal dilatation or calculi underwent lateral pancreaticojejunostomy and three patients had caudal pancreatectomy for distal disease. Results: Eight patients were completely controlled of all symptoms, with no sequelae. One case each had recurrent pancreatitis and ascites but did not require re-operation. There were two deaths: one with massive haematemesis and one with pre-existent multi-organ failure and sepsis. Conclusions: Pancreatic duct stones may be causally associated with internal pancreatic fistulae. Delineation of ductal anatomy and pathological aberrations of the pancreas, including determination of the leak site, was of paramount importance in planning surgery. Peroperative ductography proved the most useful in this regard.

AB  - Summary Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affects 1% pregnancies and is multi-factorial in origin. The role of the acquired thrombophilia antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) as a common and potentially treatable cause of RPL is well established but this is less so for inherited thrombophilia. In obstetric APS the combination of aspirin and heparin has improved outcomes. By analogy, the use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has become commonplace in women with inherited thrombophilia and also those with unexplained miscarriage to help safeguard the pregnancy. This review will examine the pathophysiological role of thrombophilia in pregnancy loss, and the evidence for anticoagulant-based intervention. The limited data supporting the use of heparin for women with RPL and inherited thrombophilia suggests adoption of a more cautious and judicious approach in this setting.

AB  - Abstract? Assessment of the neuronal control of the external anal sphincter (EAS) has long been restricted to investigating patients with defecation disorders by invasive tools such as needle electromyography (EMG), while less invasive techniques have been regarded as non-suitable for diagnostic purposes. Multichannel surface EMG by means of electrode arrays applied to anal sphincter muscle records and identifies individual motor unit action potentials, their place of origin along the circumference, their repetitive firing frequency, and their progression along the muscle fibres at different levels within the anal canal. These data shed doubts on conventional knowledge about the anatomy of the EAS muscle, and confirms new concepts of anatomical differences between gender. This may eventually be transferred to a new understanding of the role of symmetry and asymmetry of pelvic floor innervation and its role in the pathogenesis of fecal incontinence.

AB  - The addition of hydrosurgery into our surgical armamentarium will aim to revolutionize surgical wound debridement. Hydrosurgery (Versajet1) utilizes a high pressure fine saline jet delivered via a compact hand-piece to debride, irrigate and remove debri simultaneously. The hydrosurgery system is minimally invasive enabling debridement at the bedside, with minimal haemorrhage and analgesic requirements2. Its applications range from debridement of traumatic and non-traumatic wounds (acute and chronic), wound lavage, debridement of variable thickness burns, wound bed preparation prior to skin grafting, and flap recontouring. Complex infected wounds (necrotising fasciitis) may also be debrided with potential maximal preservation of adjacent neurovasculature and viable tissues. We present five cases involving the use of the Versajet for the debridement of three diabetic foot wounds, one venous ulcer, and one traumatic chest wound. All hydro-debridements were performed at the bedside with an average procedure time of 23 minutes (15?40 minutes), an average analgesic requirement of 10?mg morphine (5?15?mg), and with minimal encountered blood losses (including two patients on Coumarin). Only a single ward debridement procedure was required to achieve a healthy wound bed in all five patients. The Versajet enables debridement and wound bed preparation that is efficient, minimally invasive, and cost effective with reductions in hospital stay.

AB  - Abstract Value-based health care requires a balancing of medical outcomes with economic value. Administrators need to understand both the clinical and economic effects of potentially expensive simulation programs to rationalize the costs. Given the often-disparate priorities of clinical educators relative to health care administrators, justifying the value of simulation requires the use of economic analyses few physicians have been trained to conduct. Clinical educators need to be able to present thorough economic analyses demonstrating returns on investment and cost effectiveness to effectively communicate with administrators. At the 2017 Academic Emergency Medicine Consensus Conference ?Catalyzing System Change through Health Care Simulation: Systems, Competency, and Outcomes?, our breakout session critically evaluated the cost benefit and return on investment of simulation. In this paper we provide an overview of some of the economic tools that a clinician may use to present the value of simulation training to financial officers and other administrators in the economic terms they understand. We also define three themes as a call to action for research related to cost benefit analysis in simulation as well as four specific research questions that will help guide educators and hospital leadership to make decisions on the value of simulation for their system or program.
