They are found in up to 80% of patients with epilepsy but are only weakly related to seizure frequency or seizure severity. Indeed their clinical relevance in highly controversial and a principle of treatment is to avoid over-interpretation of epileptiform activity. Experimental data shows that interictal spikes and ictal discharges are generated by different populations of neuron through different cellular and network mechanisms and may represent a condition that delays or prevents seizure onset. However, in the immature brain seizure discharges may cause neuronal cell loss. In older children and adults interictal discharges can be accompanied by brief interruption of cognitive function even in the absence of overt seizures (transitory cognitive impairment). In children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome and CSWS (continuous spike-waves during slow sleep) prolonged nocturnal discharges can have devastating effects on language and / or behavior. This multi-disciplinary workshop will discuss the pathophysiology of interictal discharges and the significance of epileptiform activity in neonates and in older children.

AB  - ABSTRACT Introduction.? The field of erectile dysfunction (ED) is evolving and there is a need for state-of-the-art information in the area of treatment. Aim.? To develop an evidence-based, state-of-the-art consensus report on the treatment of erectile dysfunction by implants, mechanical devices, and vascular surgery. Methods.? To provide state-of-the-art knowledge concerning treatment of erectile dysfunction by implant, mechanical device, and vascular surgery, representing the opinions of 7 experts from 5 countries developed in a consensus process over a 2-year period. Main Outcome Measure.? Expert opinion was based on the grading of evidence-based medical literature, widespread internal committee discussion, public presentation, and debate. Results.? The inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) is indicated for the treatment of organic erectile dysfunction after failure or rejection of other treatment options. Comparisons between the IPP and other forms of ED therapy generally reveal a higher satisfaction rate in men with ED who chose the prosthesis. Organic ED responds well to vacuum erection device (VED) therapy, especially among men with a suboptimal response to intracavernosal pharmacotherapy. After radical prostatectomy, VED therapy combined with phosphodiesterase type 5 therapy improved sexual satisfaction in patients dissatisfied with VED alone. Penile revascularization surgery seems most successful in young men with absence of venous leakage and isolated stenosis of the internal pudendal artery following perineal or pelvic trauma. Currently, surgery to limit venous leakage is not recommended. Conclusions.? It is important for the future of the field that patients be made aware of all treatment options for erectile dysfunction in order to make an informed decision. The treating physician should be aware of the patient's medical and sexual history in helping to guide the decision. More research is needed in the area of revascularization surgery, in particular, venous outflow surgery. Hellstrom WJG, Montague DK, Moncada I, Carson C, Minhas S, Faria G, and Krishnamurti S.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the influence of body surface area, age and gender on echocardiographic parameters and to establish echocardiographic reference values for dogue de Bordeaux dogs. Methods: Thirty-nine healthy dogue de Bordeaux dogs of both sexes, older than one year, were recruited and 31 of these were included in the study. The classic linear regression model proved to be the best way to analyse the data. The reference limits of the echocardiographic measurements were calculated using the regression equations. The difference between the mean values of body surface area in both gender groups was evaluated by using one-way ANOVA. Results: A significant correlation was seen between several echocardiographic parameters and body surface area or body surface area and age, and high coefficients of determination (R2) were found. No effect of gender was detected on echocardiographic variables, except for the thickness of the left ventricular posterior wall at end diastole. Clinical Significance: The echocardiographic parameters related to body surface area, in the absence of correlation with other independent variables (gender and age) should be interpreted with caution because their variation could be significant for the presence of heart disease. The proposed statistical model allows estimation of echocardiographic parameters in dogue de Bordeaux dogs with different body surface areas and ages.

AB  - Summary Endoscopic surgery equipment is continually evolving to improve safety, image quality, usability, ergonomics and cost effectiveness. This chapter presents a general overview of devices and recommended setups for consideration by veterinary practitioners who must decide which options are best suited to their practice situation. Prudent veterinarians will bear in mind that most endoscopy equipment was designed for human medicine and surgery and that the final image produced on a video monitor can only be as good as the weakest link in the chain.

AB  - Kawasaki disease is an acute vasculitis, that has a classic complication of acquired coronary artery aneurysm. Severe forms with multi-organ involvement or neurological dysfunction are rare. Cerebral vascular involvement has been related to large-vessel injury or cardioembolism, leading to focal brain infarction. A 4-year-old female presented with unusual, rapidly catastrophic Kawasaki disease with refractory shock, acute renal failure, and coma, requiring intensive haemodynamic management. The observation of diffuse micro-haemorrhages (T2*-weighted sequence) associated with white matter injury on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pointed towards lesions of the medium/small blood vessels. Cerebral vasculitis was suspected and the immunosuppressive treatment was increased Subsequently, the patient?s recovery was rapid. On follow-up severe, bilateral vitritis was evident and surgery improved visual outcome. Early recognition of severe or unusual forms of Kawasaki disease could lead to more favourable outcome using appropriate treatment strategies. Diffuse cerebral micro-haemorrhages on T2* brain MRI sequences might be a key sign for the diagnosis of medium or small cerebral vessel involvement.

AB  - Abstract Background Gastrointestinal (GI) complications after cardiac surgery are uncommon, but are associated with high morbidity and mortality as well as significant hospital resource utilization. Methods We analysed a prospectively collected database containing all adult cardiac surgery procedures performed from July 2001 to March 2011 at Monash Medical Centre and Jessie McPherson Private Hospital. Patients with post-operative GI complications were compared to patients without GI complications who were operated in the same period. Results The incidence of GI complications was 1.1% (61 out of 5382 patients) with an overall 30-day mortality of 33% (versus 3% in the non-GI complication group). The most common complications were GI bleeding, gastroenteritis and bowel ischaemia. Patients who had GI complications were significantly older, had higher incidence of renal impairment, chronic lung disease and anticoagulation therapy and were more likely to be in cardiogenic shock. Emergency procedures, combined coronary artery bypass grafting and valve surgery and aortic dissection cases were more common in the GI complication group. The GI complication group also had higher incidence of return to theatre, renal failure, stroke, septicaemia and multi-organ failure. Conclusions GI complications after cardiac surgery remain an uncommon but dreadful complication associated with high mortality. Our findings should prompt a high degree of clinical vigilance in order to make an early diagnosis especially in high risk patients. Further studies aiming to identify independent predictors for GI complications after cardiac surgery are warranted.

AB  - A cat receiving chemotherapy for lymphoma was administered a four times overdose of vinblastine in error. Severe, acute life-threatening toxicities occurred. The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) was suspected based on electrolyte disturbances. A favourable outcome was achieved with aggressive supportive care. Personnel involved in administering chemotherapy to small animal patients must check that the patient is receiving the correct drug, at the appropriate dose, prior to every treatment.

AB  - This report details two cases of adverse drug reactions to amlodipine. The first case presented with diffuse peripheral oedema and a history of amlodipine therapy. Haematology, clinical chemistry, endocrine testing, thoracic, abdominal and cardiac imaging revealed no cause for oedema. Amlodipine therapy was discontinued and oedema diminished markedly within 72 hours. The second case presented for bilateral retinal detachments secondary to systemic hypertension. Haematology, clinical chemistry, thoracic and abdominal imaging were unremarkable and amlodipine therapy was begun. Within 72 hours, diffuse peripheral oedema developed that was unresponsive to therapy and the dog was euthanised. Veterinarians should be aware of the potential serious adverse events associated with commonly used drugs; severe, diffuse oedema is a possible adverse drug event in dogs treated with amlodipine.

AB  - Aim? To evaluate longer term outcomes of a quality improvement strategy in transfusion. Method? A Clinical Health Improvement Program (CHIP) quality improvement project was conducted in a 290 bed acute general hospital, to decrease the rate of transfusions with high pre-transfusion haemoglobins. Strategies for improvement included: formation of a Transfusion Committee; development of transfusion pathway; implementation of a Maximum Blood Order Schedule; educational strategies targeting clinical staff at all levels; promulgation of the NHRMC Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Use of Blood Components; and feedback to clinicians. The CHIP project was superseded by the ACT Haemovigilance Project, and an ACT wide concurrent transfusion audit was undertaken. There was no formal feedback on clinician performance during, or for 6?months prior to, the Haemovigilance audit. Red cell transfusion was assessed for compliance with the NHMRC Guidelines and compared with CHIP results. Result? The CHIP project demonstrated successful implementation of the selected strategies, leading to a reduction in transfusions with pre-transfusion haemoglobins greater than 90?g/L. Follow up auditing commencing six months later demonstrated a progressive, and statistically significant, increase in inappropriate transfusions over the following six months. Conclusion? Although improvement in transfusion practice was demonstrated with a multi-factorial approach to quality improvement, the improvement was not sustained in the medium term. Our results indicate the need for organisational commitment to long term quality improvement strategies in transfusion, and support the development of Transfusion Officers or Nurses to improve bedside clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract Objectives The objective was to critically appraise and highlight rigorous education research study articles published in 2014 whose outcomes advance the science of emergency medicine (EM) education. Methods A search of the English language literature in 2014 querying Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), PsychINFO, PubMed, and Scopus identified 243 EM-related articles using either quantitative (hypothesis-testing or observational investigations of educational interventions) or qualitative (exploring important phenomena in EM education) methods. Two reviewers independently screened all of the publications using previously established exclusion criteria. Six reviewers then independently scored the 25 selected publications using either a qualitative or a quantitative scoring system. Each scoring system consisted of nine criteria. Selected criteria were based on accepted educational review literature and chosen a priori. Both scoring systems use parallel scoring metrics and have been used previously within this annual review. Results Twenty-five medical education research papers (22 quantitative, three qualitative) met the criteria for inclusion and were reviewed. Five quantitative and two qualitative studies were ranked most highly by the reviewers as exemplary and are summarized in this article. Conclusions This annual critical appraisal series highlights seven excellent EM education research studies, meeting a priori criteria and published in 2014. Methodologic strengths in the 2014 papers are noted, and current trends in medical education research in EM are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND Nodular fasciitis (NF) is a benign, self-limited, fibroblastic/myofibroblastic proliferation that is diagnostically challenging, often mimicking a malignant process due to its rapid growth clinically and its high cellularity, mitotic activity, and variable/nonspecific cytomorphologic findings. Herein, the authors report what to their knowledge is the largest and first multi-institutional study of the cytomorphologic characteristics of NF by fine-needle aspiration (FNA). METHODS The pathology archives at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, and Emory University Hospital were searched for soft tissue FNA cytology specimens of masses confirmed to be NF. The clinical history, actual FNA diagnosis, and cytomorphologic features were recorded by the authors. RESULTS A total of 34 patients were identified, 33 of which had material available for review. The mean age of the patients was 40 years (range, 1-80 years); 18 patients (52.9%) were male. The mean duration of symptoms was 3.75 months. Four cases (11.8%) and 2 cases (5.9%) were signed out as NF and ?malignant neoplasm, NOS [not otherwise specified],? respectively. On average, cases were hypercellular (mean, 3.27/4). Thirty cases (90.9%) contained spindled morphology, whereas 30 cases (90.9%) and 28 cases (84.4%) contained cells with unipolar and curved cytoplasmic tails, respectively. Eccentric, ovoid, and spindled/elongated nuclei were observed in 31 cases (93.9%), 30 cases (90.9%), and 29 cases (87.9%), respectively. Nineteen cases (57.6%) lacked atypia. CONCLUSIONS In the current study, the diagnosis of NF was suggested in nearly 40% of cases. Combining the clinical presentation with the most commonly described cytomorphologic features will appropriately triage the majority of cases, although uncertainty will remain in a significant number of cases.

AB  - A five-year-old domestic shorthair cat underwent general anaesthesia and tooth extractions. Immediately after use of a high-speed, air-driven, water-cooled dental drill, the cat suffered cardiac arrest and attempted resuscitation was unsuccessful. Post-mortem radiographs showed air in the vena cava, right atrium, right auricle and right ventricle, hepatic and renal veins. These findings were confirmed at post-mortem examination. The cause of death was massive air embolism. There are reports of fatal venous air embolism in the human literature from the use of high-speed, air-driven, water-cooled dental drills. In this case, we believe that the air jet from the cooling system provided an enormous pressure gradient allowing air entry through an alveolar bone fracture or the inflamed gingival tissues. This is the first report of fatal venous air embolism associated with the use of a high-speed dental drill in the veterinary literature.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare pulmonary function and gas exchange in ponies during maintenance of anaesthesia with isoflurane or by a total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) technique. Study design Experimental, cross?over study. Animals Six healthy ponies weighing mean 286 (range 233?388) ± SD 61 kg, age 13 (9?16) ± 3 years. Methods The ponies were anaesthetized twice, a minimum of two weeks apart. Following sedation with romifidine [80 ?g kg?1 intravenously (IV)], anaesthesia was induced IV with midazolam (0.06 mg kg?1) and ketamine (2.5 mg kg?1), then maintained either with inhaled isoflurane (Fe?Iso = 1.1 vol%) (T-ISO) or an IV infusion of romifidine (120 ?g kg?1 hour?1), midazolam (0.09 mg kg?1 hour?1 IV) and ketamine (3.3 mg kg?1 hour?1) (T-TIVA). Ponies were placed in lateral recumbency. Breathing was spontaneous and Fi?O2 60%. After an instrumentation/stabilisation period of 30 minutes, arterial and mixed venous blood samples were taken simultaneously every 10 minutes for 60 minutes and analysed immediately. Oxygen extraction ratio (O2ER) and venous admixture were calculated. Tidal volume (TV), minute volume (MV), respiratory rate (fR), packed cell volume (PCV), arterial blood pressure and heart rate (HR) were measured and recorded. Data were analysed with mixed model anova (α = 0.05). Treatments were compared overall and at two selected time points (T30 and T60) using Bonferroni correction. Results Arterial and mixed venous partial pressures of O2 and CO2, and TV were significantly lower and MV and fR were higher in T-TIVA compared to T-ISO. Venous admixture did not differ between treatments. O2ER was significantly higher in T-TIVA. Mean arterial pressure was higher and HR was lower in T-TIVA compared to T-ISO. Conclusions and clinical relevance Whilst arterial CO2 was within an acceptable range during both protocols, the impairment of oxygenation was more pronounced with the T-TIVA evidenced by lower arterial and venous oxygen partial pressures.

Carrizales is a multicomponent site that encompasses the remains of (a) Early Intermediate Period (200?800 CE) cemeteries (Conjuntos 126 and 127), (b) Late Sicán/Lambayeque period (ca. 1100?1350 CE) domestic occupations (Conjuntos 125, 128, and 131), and (c) a planned town (reducción) into which indigenous people were resettled under Spanish rule, ca. 1572 CE (Conjunto 123). Faunal and botanical assemblages at the site differ significantly between the Late Sicán/Lambayeque and early colonial phases, suggesting a distinct shift in local subsistence regimes following Spanish colonisation and resettlement. Human remains were collected from Carrizales for the characterisation of dietary isotopes and further examination of the impacts of Spanish colonialism on native foodways. Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotope values were characterised in the enamel carbonate, bone carbonate, and bone collagen of individuals associated with Early Intermediate Period contexts (N = 4) and the late 16th century chapel within the site's reducción (N = 21). Over half of the study sample failed to produce viable bone collagen, an issue that is common in bioarchaeological samples from the north coast of Peru. However, among those with viable bone collagen and carbonate, there were minimal differences in δ13C, δ18O, and δ15N values between the two phases. This extends to values in enamel carbonate, which is highly resistant to diagenesis. Therefore, patterns in isotope values do not mirror the significant differences manifest in food remains from Carrizales. We suggest that (a) the diets of Early Intermediate Period individuals and Early Colonial period individuals buried at the site were quite similar, contrasting with the patterns indicated by Late Intermediate Period food remains, and (b) both populations obtained water from similar sources?a pattern that reinforces the characterisation of reducción in the Zaña Valley as a relatively local phenomenon in which nearby populations were concentrated into planned towns, rather than drawn from distant valleys.

AB  - Pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, is commonly seen in dogs and cats and presents a spectrum of disease severities from acute to chronic and mild to severe. It is usually sterile, but the causes and pathophysiology remain poorly understood. The acute end of the disease spectrum is associated with a high mortality but the potential for complete recovery of organ structure and function if the animal survives. At the other end of the spectrum, chronic pancreatitis in either species can cause refractory pain and reduce quality of life. It may also result in progressive exocrine and endocrine functional impairment. There is confusion in the veterinary literature about definitions of acute and chronic pancreatitis and there are very few studies on the pathophysiology of naturally occurring pancreatitis in dogs and cats. This article reviews histological and clinical definitions and current understanding of the pathophysiology and causes in small animals by comparison with the much more extensive literature in humans, and suggests many areas that need further study in dogs and cats.

AB  - Summary Patients with epilepsy have at least twice the fracture risk of the general population. The mechanisms for this increased fracture rate are likely multi-factorial, including fractures occurring during seizures, falls with fractures at other times, and underlying bone disease. Monitoring and recognition of the problem may help to prevent fracture-related morbidity in patients with epilepsy. Further research into causation and best practice management are required and would assist in the development of management guidelines for clinicians.

AB  - Summary This study used a questionnaire to evaluate the working situation, associated injuries and diseases of equine practitioners in the Netherlands. Equine veterinary work is physically demanding, strenuous and predisposes to diseases and injuries. Despite this, male and female equine practitioners alike appreciate their jobs and hardly ever take sick leave. There was no cynical attitude towards their own profession, but there was awareness of the risks and physical consequences, which are more or less taken for granted by the contemporary equine veterinarians. The profession still appeals to new generations of young practitioners, at least in most European countries, but there is no guarantee that this will remain so. It is the task of the profession itself to anticipate the impending changes, by improving conditions for pregnancy and childcare, for example, and to put more effort in educating (future) equine veterinary professionals about their personal health situation and work-associated risks. The objectives will be to attract well-prepared professionals and veterinary entrepreneurs.
