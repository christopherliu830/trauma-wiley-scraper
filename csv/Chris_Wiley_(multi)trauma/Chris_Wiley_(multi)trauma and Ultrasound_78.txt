AB  - An eight-year-old bull mastiff dog underwent a craniotomy for surgical excision of an olfactory lobe meningioma. Rapidly progressive neurological deficits with cervical pain developed within the early postoperative period. Intraventricular and cervical subarachnoid space air accumulation (pneumorrhachis) was identified through magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. Repair of a dural defect using synthetic dura substitute resulted in gradual resolution of neurological signs attributable to the tension pneumocephalus and subarachnoid space pneumorrhachis. Regrowth of the meningioma was not observed. Postoperative intraventricular tension pneumocephalus and air accumulation within subarachnoid space are uncommon but life-threatening complications of intracranial surgery. Early diagnosis and treatment can result in a satisfactory outcome.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the occurrence of aortic stenosis and establish echocardiographic reference values in the Dogue de Bordeaux in Denmark. Methods: Fifty-three dogs were auscultated for evidence of a cardiac murmur and a full echocardiographic examination was performed. The criterion for the diagnosis of aortic stenosis was a peak aortic velocity greater than 2·5 m/s from a subcostal transducer location. Results: A left-basilar ejection murmur was detected in 38 (72 per cent) of the dogs. An aortic ejection velocity greater than 2·5 m/s was identified in 9 (17 per cent) of the dogs from a subcostal view. The aortic annulus in Dogue de Bordeaux was smaller than that considered normal in other breeds with comparable body size. Furthermore, a decreased aortoseptal angle was noticed in dogs with aortic stenosis. Clinical Significance: The Dogue de Bordeaux may be highly predisposed to aortic stenosis. The small aortic annulus noted in healthy and affected Dogue de Bordeaux and a decreased aortoseptal angle noted in affected dogs in this study might reflect key aetiological features in the development of aortic stenosis.

AB  - Objective To clarify canine intrahepatic portal and hepatic venous system anatomy using corrosion casting and advanced imaging and to devise a novel functional anatomic model of the canine liver to investigate whether this could help guide the planning and surgical procedure of partial hepatic lobectomy and interventional radiological procedures. Study Design Prospective experimental study. Animals Adult Greyhound cadavers (n?=?8). Methods Portal and hepatic vein corrosion casts of healthy livers were assessed using computed tomography (CT). Results The hepatic lobes have a consistent hilar hepatic and portal vein supply with some variation in the number of intrahepatic branches. For all specimens, 3 surgically resectable areas were identified in the left lateral lobe and 2 surgically resectable areas were identified in the right medial lobe as defined by a functional anatomic model. Conclusions CT of detailed acrylic casts allowed complex intrahepatic vascular relationships to be investigated and compared with previous studies. Improving understanding of the intrahepatic vascular supply facilitates interpretation of advanced images in clinical patients, the planning and performance of surgical procedures, and may facilitate interventional vascular procedures, such as intravenous embolization of portosystemic shunts. Functional division of the canine liver similar to human models is possible. The left lateral and right medial lobes can be consistently divided into surgically resectable functional areas and partial lobectomies can be performed following a functional model; further study in clinically affected animals would be required to investigate the relevance of this functional model in the dog.

AB  - Objectives To summarise CT cholangiography findings in dogs with gallbladder mucocoele. Materials and Methods Each of 10 dogs with gallbladder mucocoele underwent CT cholangiography using meglumine iotroxate before cholecystectomy. The following structures of the biliary system were evaluated: the right and left hepatic ducts, common hepatic duct, cystic duct, common bile duct and gallbladder. Results The hepatic duct, cystic duct, common bile duct and gallbladder were imaged by contrast-enhanced CT cholangiography. The passage of the contrast medium through the bile duct into the duodenum was visible in nine dogs. The curved planar reformation images of two dogs showed they had filling defects in the bile duct system. In one dog with hyperbilirubinaemia due to chronic hepatitis, the bile duct system was not completely contrast-enhanced. Surgical exploration revealed no evidence of common bile duct obstruction in any dog. Clinical Significance CT cholangiography delineates the structural characteristics of the biliary system and partially estimates its patency in dogs with gallbladder mucocoele. Therefore this procedure may be useful as a preoperative screen of the bile duct system in dogs with gallbladder mucocoele.

AB  - Background:?? Necrotising fasciitis is a soft tissue infection with progressive tissue necrosis, affecting the deep fascial layers. It is a rare life-threatening disease with mortality rates from 6.1?43%. Many factors have been associated with increased mortality. The aim of this study is to re-evaluate these factors by analysing data from a larger patient series than any presented in the published literature to date. Methods:?? The medical records of 151 sequential patients with necrotising fasciitis treated in the Alfred Hospital from 1997?2004 were reviewed to identify the factors associated with increased mortality. The data was then analysed with multivariate analysis to identify the statistically significant factors. Results:?? Mortality rate of this study was 11.3%. The statistically significant factors were CRP > 200 on admission (p = 0.018), mechanical ventilation on admission (p = 0.002), older age (p = 0.0231), male (p = 0.013), delayed hyperbaric therapy from first symptoms (p = 0.045), spontaneous precipitant (p = 0.015), and complications of multi organ failure (p = 0.006), acute renal failure (0.011), acidosis (p = 0.001) or atrial fibrillation (p = 0.001), sepsis (p = 0.045). Conclusions:?? The knowledge of these factors will assist in the management of necrotising fasciitis by prioritising these patients, allocating more appropriate resources to prevent delay in hyperbaric treatment and by promptly treat the disease, especially in ICU setting to prevent complications and improve survival.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe surgical techniques, caval occlusion times, and short-term outcomes in dogs undergoing adrenalectomy with caval venotomy. Study design Retrospective case series. Animals Dogs undergoing adrenalectomy with caval venotomy between October 1, 2010 and May 31, 2018. Methods Medical records of dogs undergoing adrenalectomy with caval venotomy were reviewed for signalment, perioperative management, surgical details, perioperative complications, mortality, and histopathology. Computed tomography images were reviewed to describe tumor morphology and signs of thrombus extension. Results Nineteen dogs had adrenal tumor thrombi extending into the prehepatic (14 dogs, 74%), hepatic (3 dogs, 16%), and posthepatic (2 dogs, 11%) caudal vena cava. Tumors occurred in left (11) and right (8) adrenal glands. Median caval occlusion was 6.5 minutes (range, 2?25). Two to six vascular tourniquets were used. Venotomy closure was performed under full caval occlusion in 11 dogs and by using a partial occlusion clamp in 8 dogs. Left ureteronephrectomy was performed in 5 dogs. Perioperative mortality rate was 21% (4 dogs). Conclusion Extension of caval tumor thrombus beyond the hepatic hilus did not preclude a good outcome. Longer caval occlusion than has been previously reported was tolerated in some cases. Number of vascular tourniquets used reflected the location of phrenicoabdominal vein insertion on the cava and length of the caval tumor thrombus. Venotomy closure under full occlusion was often required for right adrenal tumors. When required, ureteronephrectomy was left sided. Clinical significance Dogs with adrenal tumors extending beyond the hepatic hilus and those requiring a long caval occlusion time can survive adrenalectomy.

AB  - What's already known about this topic? There is level 1 (RCT) evidence for improved neurological outcomes after open fetal surgery for spina bifida versus postnatal surgery. There is a lack of standardization of techniques and comparative outcome data in clinical trials for endoscopic fetal surgery for spina bifida. What does this study add? Different techniques, their strengths, limitations and clinical implications of endoscopic versus open fetal surgery for spina bifida are discussed. Open fetal surgery anticipates postnatal surgery, whereas novel and less invasive endoscopic approaches aim to simplify the technique. More data on long-term follow-up of intrauterine closure of spina bifida are needed, and open surgery is one step ahead of fetoscopic approaches.

AB  - Abstract In 2015, it can be said that the diabetic foot is no longer the Cinderella of diabetic complications. Thirty years ago there was little evidence-based research taking place on the diabetic foot, and there were no international meetings addressing this topic. Since then, the biennial Malvern Diabetic Foot meetings started in 1986, the American Diabetes Association founded their Foot Council in 1987, and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes established a Foot Study Group in 1998. The first International Symposium on the Diabetic Foot in The Netherlands was convened in 1991, and this was soon followed by the establishment of the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot that has produced useful guidelines in several areas of investigation and the management of diabetic foot problems. There has been an exponential rise in publications on diabetic foot problems in high impact factor journals, and a comprehensive evidence-base now exists for many areas of treatment. Despite the extensive evidence available, it, unfortunately, remains difficult to demonstrate that most types of education are efficient in reducing the incidence of foot ulcers. However, there is evidence that education as part of a multi-disciplinary approach to diabetic foot ulceration plays a pivotal role in incidence reduction. With respect to treatment, strong evidence exists that offloading is the best modality for healing plantar neuropathic foot ulcers, and there is also evidence from two randomized controlled trials to support the use of negative-pressure wound therapy in complex post-surgical diabetic foot wounds. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy exhibits the same evidence level and strength of recommendation. International guidelines exist on the management of infection in the diabetic foot. Many randomized trials have been performed, and these have shown that the agents studied generally produced comparable results, with the exception of one study in which tigecycline was shown to be clinically inferior to ertapenem?±?vancomycin. Similarly, there are numerous types of wound dressings that might be used in treatment and which have shown efficacy, but no single type (or brand) has shown superiority over others. Peripheral artery disease is another major contributory factor in the development of ulceration, and its presence is a strong predictor of non-healing and amputation. Despite the proliferation of endovascular procedures in addition to open revascularization, many patients continue to suffer from severely impaired perfusion and exhaust all treatment options. Finally, the question of the true aetiopathogenesis of Charcot neuroarthropathy remains enigmatic, although much work is currently being undertaken in this area. In this area, it is most important to remember that a clinically uninfected, warm, insensate foot in a diabetic patient should be considered as a Charcot foot until proven otherwise, and, as such, treated with offloading, preferably in a cast.

AB  - Currently there is no published data using the Cannon catheter. Our purpose was to confirm adequacy of hemodialysis using the Arrow Cannon catheter. This retrospective study used patients from one nephrology practice, utilizing two dialysis centers. All patients in a two year period meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria referred for tunneled catheter placement were included. All catheters were placed by interventional nephrologist using ultrasound for vein cannulation and fluoroscopy for placement confirmation. Pump speed (Qb), venous and arterial pressures, Kt/V, urea reduction ratio (URR), and dialysis prescriptions/adherence to the prescription were reviewed at baseline and monthly for six months. Catheter removal or six months were the study endpoints. Complications were evaluated from time of insertion throughout the study period. 38 patients were enrolled in the study. All patients were treated in the outpatient setting. Insertion outcome was successful in all 38 patients. The average dialysis prescription was approximately 400?ml/min, 3.7 hours, and 3 days a week. The mean average pump speed for all months evaluated exceeded the K/DOQI guideline of 300?ml/min. by 67.9?101.4?ml/min. The differences were significant with p?<?0.01. The mean Kt/V and URR% data for each month evaluated exceeded the K/DOQI guideline values of 1.2 for Kt/V and 63% for URR% by between .34?.24 and 8%?10%, respectively; the differences were all at a significant level with p?<?0.01. Mean arterial pressures for all months evaluated ranged from ?218.6 to ?238.1, and venous pressures averaged between 179.8 to 213.7. Only three patients experienced late complications (all of which were infections) and no patients required hospitalization post complication. Two were bacteremic; the other had tunnel infection without positive blood cultures. This is the first retrospective study to evaluate the adequacy of hemodialysis with the Cannon catheter. Our study showed that flow rates and adequacy of hemodialysis can be reached using the Cannon catheter, with minimal complications.

AB  - Abstract Objectives With the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Next Accreditation System, emergency medicine (EM) residency programs will be required to report residents' progress through the EM milestones. The milestones include five progressively advancing skill levels, with Level 1 defining the skill set of a medical school graduate and Level 5, that of an attending physician. The ACGME stresses that multiple forms of assessment should be used to ensure capture of the multifaceted competencies. The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility and results of programmatic assessment of Level 1 milestones using multisource assessments for incoming EM interns in July. Methods The study population was interns starting in 2012 and 2013. Interns' Level 1 milestone assessment was done with four distinct methods: 1) the postgraduate orientation assessment (POA) by the Graduate Medical Education Office for all incoming interns (this multistation examination covers nine of the EM milestones and includes standardized patient cases, task completion, and computer-based stations); 2) direct observation of patient encounters by core faculty using a milestones-based clinical skills competency checklist; 3) the global monthly assessment at the end of the intern orientation month that was updated to reflect the EM milestones; and 4) faculty assessment during procedural labs. These occurred during the July orientation month that included the POA, clinical shifts, didactic sessions, and procedure labs. Results In the POA, interns were competent in 48% to 93% of the milestones assessed. Overall, competency was 70% to 80%, with low scores noted in aseptic technique (patient care Milestone 13 [PC13]) and written and verbal hand-off (interpersonal communications skills [ICS]2). In overall communication, 70% of interns demonstrated competency. In excess of 80% demonstrated competency in critical values interpretation (PC3), informed consent (PC9), pain assessment (PC11), and geriatric functional assessment (PC3). On direct observation, almost all Level 1 milestones were achieved (93% to 100%); however, only 78% of interns achieved competency in pharmacotherapy (PC5). On global monthly evaluations, all interns met Level 1 milestones. Conclusions A multisource assessment of EM milestones is feasible and useful to determine Level 1 milestones achievement for incoming interns. A structured assessment program, used in conjunction with more traditional forms of evaluation such as global monthly evaluations and direct observation, is useful for identifying deficits in new trainees and may be able inform the creation of early intervention programs.

AB  - Background Needle-free, transcutaneous pneumatic injection systems can be used to deliver therapeutic solutions to targeted layers of skin in a minimally invasive manner. Methods To evaluate jet infiltration patterns and tissue reactions, 5% isotonic and 20% hypertonic glucose solutions were pneumatically injected into in vivo micropig skin. Gelatin TM phantom was additionally prepared to analyze penetration and dispersion patterns for different experimental settings. Results As immediate tissue reactions in the in vivo micropig skin, distinct pneumatic injection injury zones (PIIZs) in the dermis, extending from the papillary dermis deep into the dermo-subcutaneous junction, were generated with the 5% and 20% glucose solutions and with pneumatic pressures of 4.64 and 5.7 bars, respectively. PIIZs markedly decreased in appearance at 1 day after treatment, accompanied by inflammatory cell infiltration, and disappeared at 7 days post-treatment with increased collagen and elastin production. In TM phantom study, the PIIZs created by 20% glucose mainly comprised a single, homogenous, round to oval zone, whereas those created by 5% glucose were irregular and multi-lobular. Conclusion The present study suggests that transcutaneous pneumatic injection therapy may exert mechanical stimulatory effects, immediate tissue shrinkage via hypertonic solutions, and late tissue regeneration effects during wound healing.

AB  - Abstract This study aims to compare the therapeutic effectiveness of continuous catheter drainage versus intermittent needle aspiration in the percutaneous treatment of pyogenic liver abscesses. Over a 5-year period, 64 consecutive patients with pyogenic liver abscess were treated with intravenous antibiotics (ampicillin, cefuroxime, and metronidazole) and randomized into two percutaneous treatment groups: continuous catheter drainage (with an 8F multi-sidehole pigtail catheter); and intermittent needle aspiration (18G disposable trocar needle). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding patient demographics, underlying coexisting disease, abscess size, abscess number, number of loculation of abscess, the presenting clinical symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, and pretreatment liver function test. Although not statistically significant, the duration of intravenous antibiotics treatment before percutaneous treatment was longer with the catheter group, and the change of antibiotics after the sensitivity test was more frequent with the needle group. The needle group was associated with a higher treatment success rate, a shorter duration of hospital stay, and a lower mortality rate, although this did not reach statistical significance. In conclusion, this study suggests that intermittent needle aspiration is probably as effective as continuous catheter drainage for the treatment of pyogenic liver abscess, although further proof with a large-scale study is necessary. Due to the additional advantages of procedure simplicity, patient comfort, and reduced price, needle aspiration deserves to be considered as a first-line drainage approach.

AB  - The production of jewellery is currently mostly industrial and the jewellers perform only one or two stages in the manufacturing process. The jewellers make jewellery by hand in small workshops and are more polyvalent: they shape the metal with pliers or hand tools or cast it in moulds, assemble the individual parts with glues, carve metal, diamonds and other stones, clean metals with soaps and ultrasonic baths. The occupational dermatitis is of irritant nature (acid and alkalis in metal cleaners, soaps, detergents, metal dust, abrasions from polishing wheels and emery paper, heat, adhesives, etc) and allergic nature (potassium dichromate, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, ammoniated mercury, carba mix, epoxy resin, mercapto mix, formaldehyde, nickel, colophony). We report the cases of two jewellers working in workshops. A 47 year old atopic woman already known for a sensitivity to metals (nickel, potassium dichromate and cobalt) developed recurrent vesiculo-pustular erythematous lesions of both palms with occasional infections treated with systemic antibiotics and topical steroids. Patch tests were performed for the European standard series, woods, and personal series. There were positive?+?reactions at 96?h to colophony, palladium, and personal waxes. Information obtained through the manufacturer revealed colophony in the waxes frequently used by jewellers to fix the precious stones to woods and metal allowing the stones to be carved. A 47 years old atopic man working as a jeweller for 32 years developed recurrent eczematous lesions of the fingers of the right hand. Patch tests were performed for the European standard series, preservatives, plastics, acrylates and personals series and were positive?+?+?at 96?h for urea formaldehyde, diethylenetriamine, araldite hardener and the soap used to clean the jewels. Uncommonly this contact allergy is not due to the epoxy resins themselves but to the hardener. The urea formaldehyde and the diethylenetriamine are in fact used as epoxy resins hardeners. There were no reactions to the araldite resin but there was one to its hardener. In conclusion we report two unusual cases of hand contact dermatitis in jewellers. Because jewellers are exposed to a variety of substances, to detect the allergens the inquiry must be accurate and extensive patch testing may be required. Common allergens are compounds of uncommon substances and tools and uncommon allergens are compounds of well-known sensitizers.

AB  - Objectives To determine whether dogs with surgically excised mast cell tumours receiving a vinblastine/prednisolone chemotherapy protocol in combination with radiation therapy are at greater risk of myelosuppression than patients receiving the chemotherapy protocol alone. Materials and Methods Retrospective study of clinical records of dogs with mast cell tumours that, subsequent to surgical excision, had received combination vinblasine/prednisolone chemotherapy. Dogs were assigned to two groups: those treated with adjunctive radiotherapy and vinblastine/prednisolone (RT group) and those treated with surgery followed by vinblastine/prednisolone alone (control group). Haematology results were compared between groups. Results Forty-three cases and 43 controls of similar breed, age and bodyweight were included. Concurrent radiation and vinblastine chemotherapy did not appear to increase the risk of neutropenia, which was observed in 18.6 and 23.2% of cases in the RT and control groups, respectively. Clinical Significance Radiation and vinblastine chemotherapy can be safely combined in dogs with mast cell tumours without increasing the risk of clinically important myelosuppression.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder most often diagnosed 10?years after its onset and development. It is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-? peptide (ABP) into amyloid plaques between nerve cells, which produces a massive local neurodegeneration. Molecular magnetic resonance imaging allows diagnosis of AD by showing ABP accumulation in the brain. The ultrasmall particles of iron oxide (USPIO) derivatives proposed in the present work were functionalized with peptides that present an affinity for ABP, independently of its state of aggregation. Their nanomolar Kd* confirms the high affinity of our vectorized contrast agents (VCA) for ABP and therefore their high labeling potential, specificity and sensitivity. Their lack of toxicity has been demonstrated, both by in vitro studies using the MTT method on several cell types, and by in vivo investigations with assessment of renal and hepatic biomarkers and by histopathology evaluation. The results of biodistribution studies corroborated by MRI demonstrate that USPIO-PHO (USPIO coupled to peptide C-IPLPFYN-C) are able to cross the blood?brain barrier without any facilitating strategy, and accumulates in the brain 90?min after its injection in NMRI mice. None of the USPIO derivatives were found in any organs one week after administration. To conclude, USPIO-PHO seems to have a genuine potential for labeling amyloid plaques in the brain; it has a nanomolar binding affinity, no toxic effects, and its elimination half-life is about 3?h. Further tests will be made on transgenic mice, aimed at confirming the potential of early AD diagnosis using our VCA. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
