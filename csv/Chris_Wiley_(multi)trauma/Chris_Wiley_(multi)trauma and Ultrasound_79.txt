AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder most often diagnosed 10?years after its onset and development. It is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-? peptide (ABP) into amyloid plaques between nerve cells, which produces a massive local neurodegeneration. Molecular magnetic resonance imaging allows diagnosis of AD by showing ABP accumulation in the brain. The ultrasmall particles of iron oxide (USPIO) derivatives proposed in the present work were functionalized with peptides that present an affinity for ABP, independently of its state of aggregation. Their nanomolar Kd* confirms the high affinity of our vectorized contrast agents (VCA) for ABP and therefore their high labeling potential, specificity and sensitivity. Their lack of toxicity has been demonstrated, both by in vitro studies using the MTT method on several cell types, and by in vivo investigations with assessment of renal and hepatic biomarkers and by histopathology evaluation. The results of biodistribution studies corroborated by MRI demonstrate that USPIO-PHO (USPIO coupled to peptide C-IPLPFYN-C) are able to cross the blood?brain barrier without any facilitating strategy, and accumulates in the brain 90?min after its injection in NMRI mice. None of the USPIO derivatives were found in any organs one week after administration. To conclude, USPIO-PHO seems to have a genuine potential for labeling amyloid plaques in the brain; it has a nanomolar binding affinity, no toxic effects, and its elimination half-life is about 3?h. Further tests will be made on transgenic mice, aimed at confirming the potential of early AD diagnosis using our VCA. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Objectives:?? Extended radical pelvic resection for advanced primary or recurrent pelvic malignancy is an increasingly common procedure in major colorectal units. Aggressive pre operative chemo-radio therapy creates a cohort of patients with difficult reconstructive variables. We review our plastic surgical reconstructions in this highly heterogeneous population. Method:?? Utilizing the coding system at our institution we identified a cohort of patients whom underwent Vertical Rectus Abdominis Musculocutaneous (VRAM) reconstruction for exenterative pelvic surgery. A thorough retrospective case note analysis was performed specifically looking at three variable subsets. Demographic data and peri-operative care Reconstructive surgical procedures and complications Tumour variables and patient survival outcomes Results:?? Statistical analysis of the patient cohort and subsets will be presented Conclusions:?? This study has demonstrated the versatility of the VRAM flap in obtaining a stable and supple reconstructive cover in advanced pelvic malignancy surgery. Our series confirms strong support for immediate VRAM reconstruction in all pelvic exenterative procedures. We have shown patients undergoing multi-visceral resection after prior chemo-radiotherapy can achieve early, healed and stable perineal closure with low morbidity.

AB  - Objective To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of a cremophor-free formulation of paclitaxel (Paccal Vet, Oasmia Pharmaceuticals) in dogs with mast cell tumours. Methods Paccal Vet was administered at a median dose of 145 (range, 135 to 150) mg/m2intravenously once every 21 days for three cycles to 29 dogs with macroscopic grade 2 or 3 mast cell tumour. Efficacy was assessed by tumour response (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.0) and performance status score. Progression-free survival, quality of life and safety/adverse events were also evaluated. Clinical safety was assessed by clinicopathological analyses and recording of adverse events. Results Complete or partial response was observed in 59% of dogs. Performance status score remained constant or improved for 20 dogs and decreased by one grade for 9 dogs. Median time to progression was 247 (range, 42 to 268) days. Expected, transient frequently subclinical adverse events (primarily grade 3/4 neutropenia and grade 1/2 leukopenia) were observed in the majority of dogs. Nine dogs were euthanased and one dog died due to disease progression. Clinical Significance Paccal Vet appears to be a clinically safe and effective treatment for canine mast cell tumours. Further controlled confirmatory investigation is warranted.

AB  - Objective? To evaluate the efficacy of epidurally administered deracoxib to mediate the signs of a sodium urate crystal-induced stifle synovitis in dogs, and to compare the efficacy of epidural versus subcutaneously administered deracoxib. Study Design? Experimental, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled modified cross-over design. Animals? Random source, adult, mixed breed dogs (n=24; 14 males, 10 females). Methods? Sodium urate crystals were used to create a stifle synovitis model to evaluate the efficacy of deracoxib. Dogs were divided into 4 groups: 3?mg/kg epidural deracoxib, 1.5?mg/kg epidural deracoxib, 3?mg/kg subcutaneous deracoxib, and a placebo (vehicle for deracoxib). Force plate and subjective evaluations were made at time 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours post-treatment. Repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni-corrected post hoc comparisons was used to determine significant treatment effects. Results? Peak vertical force (PVF) and vertical impulse (VI) were both significantly higher in deracoxib treated dogs compared with placebo. For 3?mg/kg epidural and subcutaneous deracoxib, PVF and VI were significantly greater than for 1.5?mg/kg epidural deracoxib. Overall pain score for all deracoxib-treated dogs was significantly lower than for placebo dogs. Conclusions? Epidural administration of deracoxib is effective at providing analgesia in an acute joint pain model; however, it does not appear to be more effective than systemic administration. Clinical Relevance? Injectable deracoxib is effective in providing analgesia in acute inflammatory conditions of synovial joints.

AB  - Purpose? Complications of free tissue transfer often are mentioned only in passing, be it in a forum or published literature. Minor details as discussed in this presentation are often are not emphasized and occasionally neglected. Materials and methods? Of the 75 consecutive cases, majority were for head and neck reconstruction. Specific factors that are discussed are 1. Pedicle twist and precautions on perforator flaps 2. Pedicle in a tunnel- how wide is safe. 3. One vein versus two veins ? when to choose 4. Could the beginner initiate his microsurgery on the second comitant vein? Are there alternatives to a safer teaching model? 5. Precautions in choosing recipient vessels in traumatic limbs with disuse atrophy 6. ?Distal run off?? distance of freeing the recipient vessels. Other issues discussed are, prevention of vessel desiccation, precautions with hemoclips; pharmacotherapy versus re exploration, and rare causes of failure such as drug hit phenomenon. Results? Among 75 free flaps, the ALT flap was the workhorse. Others included the radial forearm, fibula, Latissimus dorsi and gracilis. Of the 7 re-explorations 3 had pharmacotherapy as the first intervention. There were 4 complete failures, 2-partial failures, 1-complete salvage. Overall success rate was 90%. Conclusions? Success comes with good decisions; good decisions come with experience, though experience come with bad decisions. The factors discussed here aim to share the bad experiences that could be diligently avoided to obtain higher success rates.

AB  - Introduction: Antibiotic resistance develops in human patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with increased duration of stay. The major selection factor is the use of antimicrobial agents. The hypothesis tested in this study was that antimicrobial resistance in fecal E. coli isolated from dogs increased with increased length of stay in the ICU. Methods: E. coli were isolated from rectal swabs collected on days 0 (D0, day of admission to the ICU), 3 (D3), 6 (D6), and 9 (D9) from all dogs housed in the ICU for 3 or more days. The E. coli were tested for resistance to nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Thirty-two patients were included in the study, 17 with D0-D3 and 15 with D0-D6 E. coli isolates. Five E. coli strains were isolated each sampling day and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, resulting in a total of 60 outcomes per day per dog. The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) was calculated for each day up to D6. Univariate ANOVA analysis was used to analyze the data. Results: The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) increased from 9.3% on D0 to 14.7% on D3 to 27.9% on D6. Resistance to the frequently used ampicillin increased in a linear manner with increased duration of stay. The proportion of ampicillin-resistant colonies increased from 19.6% on D0 to 39.1% on D3 to 68.7% on D6 (p=0.001). Resistance to the infrequently used amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, also increased significantly (p=0.026) and linearly. The increase in resistance to enrofloxacin was significant (p=0.046); but the increase in resistance to the precursor, nalidixic acid, was highly significant (p=0.020). No change in resistance to gentamicin was found. The remaining antibiotics tested showed an insignificant increase in resistance. Conclusions: Resistance to antibiotics increased in dogs with duration of stay in the ICU for 3 or more days. This linear trend was most significant with penicillin-based beta-lactams, which are frequently used in the ICU. Consequently, critically ill dogs may be at increased risk for developing opportunistic infections, caused by multi-drug resistant organisms.

AB  - Objective The Lifestyle Interventions for Expectant Moms (LIFE-Moms) Consortium is designed to determine, in pregnant women with overweight or obesity, whether various behavioral and lifestyle interventions reduce excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) and subsequent adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes and obesity in offspring. The design and planning process of the LIFE-Moms Consortium is described. Methods The LIFE-Moms Consortium is a collaboration among seven clinical centers, a Research Coordinating Unit, and the NIH designed to support each clinical center's conduct of a separate trial of a unique intervention. Specific common measures, procedures, and eligibility criteria are consistent across the seven trials allowing data to be combined in exploratory analyses and/or compared readily. Results Numerous committees and working groups were created to define common measures and outcomes during pregnancy and through 1 year postpartum, develop Consortium policies, and oversee progress of the trials. The primary outcome for the Consortium is excessive GWG. Secondary outcomes include maternal, neonatal, and infant anthropometric measures, physical activity, sleep, and complications of pregnancy and delivery. Conclusions A multi-center consortium of independent, lifestyle interventions with common measures and outcomes may enhance the ability to identify promising interventions for improving outcomes in pregnant women and their offspring.

AB  - Summary As the practice of canine rehabilitation and sports medicine continues to evolve, roles of practitioners are more specialized as approaches become more advanced. Clinical reasoning, care pathways, and specific applied interventions are adopted from the interprofessional practice of human sports medicine, requiring knowledge and understanding of the art and science of physical rehabilitation and related medical sciences. Contributing to a multifaceted team, the rehabilitation professional must be able to synthesize information related to the integrity and efficiency of the neuromusculoskeletal system, in coordination with other body systems, to affect the functional abilities of the patient. This is accomplished through the examination and evaluation of the patient with the purpose of identifying medical comorbidities, specific impairments, functional limitations, and disabilities. Understanding the interplay between the objective information collected during the rehabilitation examination and evaluation, patient-specific factors, and knowledge of basic sciences, physics, and biomechanics will guide the therapist in establishing a treatment plan that will ultimately contribute to the patient's return to an optimal level of function following injury, illness, or onset of a medical disorder or disease. The purpose of this introductory chapter is to: Define the practice of canine rehabilitation. Describe various contributions of the different members of the interprofessional canine rehabilitation team. Discuss the history and evolution of the practice of canine rehabilitation in the United States and internationally. Describe the practice of physical therapy as it pertains to the management of the canine rehabilitation patient. Discuss specific physiological considerations for the canine rehabilitation therapist when planning rehabilitation interventions. Describe patient management and treatment planning methods by which the canine rehabilitation therapist coordinates the implementation of treatment strategies and interventions.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used for treatment of musculoskeletal diseases in horses, but there is ongoing debate regarding the relative safety and efficacy of allogeneic MSCs, compared with autologous equine MSCs. This review summarises the currently available published data regarding the therapeutic use of autologous and allogeneic MSCs in horses. Arguments that have been advanced against the use of allogeneic MSCs include higher risk of immunological reactions and shorter cell survival times following injection. Arguments favouring the use of allogeneic MSCs include the ability to bank cells and reduce the time to treatment, to collect MSCs from younger donor animals and the ability to manipulate banked cells prior to administration. In vitro studies and a limited set of experimental in vivo studies have indicated that adverse immunological reactions may occur when allogeneic MSCs are administered to horses. However, newer studies lack evidence of inflammatory reactions or adverse clinical responses when allogeneic MSCs are administered and compared with autologous MSCs. Thus, while the relative merits of allogeneic vs autologous MSCs for treatment of musculoskeletal injuries in horses have not been fully established, accumulating evidence from studies in horses suggests that allogeneic MSCs maybe a safe alternative to autologous MSCs. Large, properly designed, randomised trials in addition to careful immunological evaluation of short-term and long-term, local and systemic immune responses are needed to more fully resolve the issue.

AB  - Summary Manual therapy is an umbrella term used for the therapeutic handling techniques covering numerous soft-tissue techniques including massage, passive movements and joint mobilisations. Joint mobilisations can be performed on peripheral and vertebral joints covering dorsoventral pressures on the facet joints of the spine, distraction or traction, accessory movements and passive movements. Massage reduces muscle spasm and can aid recovery of muscles following vigorous exercise, through the increase in circulation that will remove waste materials such as lactic acid. The mechanical effects of petrissage are to assist venous and lymphatic flow and mobilise connective tissue and skin. Different practitioners, chiropractors, osteopaths and physiotherapists use different techniques to move joints. Physiotherapists tend to use joint mobilisations that are passive rhythmical movements or oscillations that are used to treat stiffness or pain. After each technique, reassess how the joint is moving and use the most effective technique last.

AB  - Summary. Successful percutaneous liver biopsy was carried out on 12 multi-transfused haemophiliacs from the Manchester area with persistently abnormal liver function tests. Only one patient showed evidence of chronic active hepatitis with progression to active micronodular cirrhosis although a further four patients showed some evidence of mild chronic active hepatitis. This represents a much lower incidence of severe histological liver damage than many previous reports and implies that liver biopsy in asymptomatic haemophiliacs may not be indicated as a routine procedure, particularly in the absence of proven therapy. Dynamic liver function tests may prove to be a useful indicator of deteriorating liver function in the otherwise asymptomatic haemophiliac.

AB  - Summary This chapter explores the main tasks a foundation doctor can expect to face in their surgical job, and provides practical tips and advice to guide them in becoming a proficient, confident, multi-tasking junior surgeon. All patients undergoing elective surgery will be assessed preoperatively, usually in pre-assessment clinics a few weeks prior to surgery. To reduce the risk of aspiration during anaesthesia, patients are fasted preoperatively. Obtaining consent is an art combining communication skills, surgical knowledge and perception. Further to all the checks doctor have done, further perioperative checks are done according to the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist. Thromboprophylaxis is essential in the surgical setting. One of doctor's most important roles on the wards will be management of post-operative patients. They will need a constant degree of suspicion for emerging complications, which may be directly related to surgery or indirect responses to the physiological stresses of surgery and anaesthesia.

AB  - Summary This chapter demonstrates the variation in the radiological appearances of conditions of vascular anomalies of the mid- and lower face. Vascular anomalies comprise two broad categories: vascular tumours (proliferative neoplasms) and vascular malformations. First-line treatment of haemangioma, vascular tumour, is medical, utilising propranolol, with surgery reserved for complicated or refractory lesions. A spectrum of non-proliferative lesions results from errors in vascular formation. Uncomplicated lesions increase in size proportionally with patient growth. Large lesions are often cystic, exhibiting prominent vascular channels, and are hyperintense with septations. Small lesions reveal less prominent vascular channels and tend to be more ?solid? with intermediate signal intensities. MRA and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) may reveal localised and remote associated vascular changes and multi-focal lesions. Jaw based lesions usually present as a lucent (unilocular) or variably multilocular well-defined corticated lesion and most commonly these are seen in the posterior mandible. Occasionally, the borders are ill defined in appearance, especially on intraoral and panoramic radiographs.

AB  - Hospital acquired infections (HAI) are a major source of morbidity and mortality in human and veterinary hospitals. Research in human hospitals has shown that well focused staff education is an important step in limiting the development of HAI. Our hospital currently has no training program with respect to HAI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the general knowledge of hospital staff concerning HAI as the first step in developing a hospital wide education program. Ninety doctors and technicians were given a questionnaire containing 15 questions about HAI. The questionnaires were hand distributed and immediately completed. Ten of the questions tested knowledge of HAI, while five questions concerned the individual's perception of HAI in our hospital. Answers were given as a range from strongly agree to strongly disagree or in the form of multiple choice. With respect to their perception of HAI, 66% of technicians and 50% of doctors believed that they possess a good working knowledge of HAI. Several areas for improvement in hospital staff knowledge were identified. Technicians were more likely than doctors to incorrectly believe that 1) routine environmental cultures are effective at preventing HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 30%, doctors 52%), 2) that all animals that aspirated gastric contents under anesthesia develop clinical evidence of pneumonia (percent correct answer: technicians 55%, doctors 84%), and 3) that animals with an indwelling urinary catheter should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics (percent correct answer: technicians 51%, doctors 90%). In addition, doctors were more likely to identify Amikacin as the antibiotic of choice for patients with HAI in our hospital (percent correct answer: technicians 27%, doctors 79%). Neither group was able to adequately identify the patients in the ICU as the primary reservoir for the multi-drug resistant pathogens that cause HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 20%, doctors 15%). The discrepancy in knowledge between the two groups is likely explained by attendance of faculty, residents, and interns at one or more continuing education rounds sessions where HAI were discussed. This finding is contrary to what is frequently found in human hospitals where the nursing staff typically demonstrates superior knowledge of HAI when compared to doctors. The results of this study demonstrate that knowledge of HAI is not optimal in both the doctors and technicians in our hospital. Further better focused efforts are warranted to address the educational shortcomings evidenced by this study.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Pleural infection is a condition commonly encountered by the respiratory physician. This review aims to provide the reader with an update on the most recent data regarding the epidemiology, microbiology, and the management of pleural infection. Data source Medline was searched for articles related to pleural infection using the terms ?pleural infection,? ?empyema,? and ?parapneumonic.? The search was limited to the years 1997-2017. Only human studies and reports in English were included. Results A rise in the incidence of pleural infection is seen worldwide. Despite the improvement in healthcare practices, the mortality from pleural infection remains high. The role of oral microflora in the etiology of pleural infection is firmly established. A concise review of the recent insights on the pathogenesis of pleural infections is presented. A particular focus is made on the role of tPA, DNAse and similar substances and their interaction with inflammatory cells and how this affects the pathogenesis and treatment of pleural infection. Conclusion Pleural infection is a common disease with significant morbidity and mortality, as well as a considerable economic burden. The role of medical management is expanding thanks to the widespread use of newer treatments.
