AB  - The first in this series of five papers concerns the evaluation and management of renal injuries. The authors of this paper come from four continents and seven countries, and they reviewed all papers on renal injury published between 1966 and April 2002. The results of the authors? deliberations are present here as a consensus document. OBJECTIVE To determine the optimal evaluation and management of renal injuries by review of the world's English-language literature on the subject. METHODS A consensus conference convened by the World Health Organization and the Societé Internationale d?Urologie met to critically review reports of the diagnosis and treatment of renal trauma. The English-language literature about renal trauma was identified using Medline, and additional cited works not detected in the initial search obtained. Evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of renal trauma were made with reference to a five-point scale. RESULTS There were many Level 3 and 4 citations, few Level 2, and one Level 1 which supported clinical practice patterns. Findings of nearly 200 reviewed citations are summarized. CONCLUSIONS Published reports on renal trauma still rely heavily on expert opinion and single-institution retrospective case series. Prospective trials of the most significant issues, when possible, might improve the quality of evidence that dictates the behaviour of practitioners.

AB  - Abstract:? Until the late 1960s, splenectomy was routinely performed in children who had sustained blunt splenic injury. There was based on the ability to perform splenectomy without obvious consequence; the cited 90?100% mortality for splenic trauma and the possibility of delayed rupture of the spleen. In contrast, contemporary findings in immunology and surgery demonstrated that non-operative management was not only feasible but desirable in view of the potential for overwhelming post-plenectomy infection. The history of universal splenectomy following blunt splenic trauma has been reviewed and we outline the findings that have resulted in the current standard of non-operative management following blunt splenic trauma.

AB  - ABSTRACT The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) treatment initiating after inflammation stage on the process of bone-tendon junction (BTJ) healing in a rabbit model. Thirty-six rabbits undergoing partial patellectomy were randomly divided into two groups: control and LIPUS. The period of initial inflammatory stage is 2 weeks. So LIPUS treatment was initiated at postoperative week 2 and continued until the patella-patellar tendon (PPT) complexes were harvested at postoperative weeks 4, 8, and 16. At each time point, the PPT complexes were harvested for qRT-PCR, histology, radiographs, synchroton radiation micro computed tomography (SR-µCT), and biomechanical testing. The qRT-PCR results showed that LIPUS treatment beginning at postoperative week 2 played an anti-inflammatory role in BTJ healing. Histologically, the LIPUS group showed more advanced remodeling of the lamellar bone and marrow cavity than the control group. The area and length of the new bone in the LIPUS group were significantly greater than the control group at postoperative weeks 8 and 16. SR-µCT demonstrated that new bone formation and remodeling in the LIPUS group were more advanced than the control group. Biomechanical test results demonstrated that the failure load, ultimate strength and energy at failure were significantly higher than those of the control group. In conclusion, LIPUS treatment beginning at postoperative week 2 was able to accelerate bone formation during the bone-tendon junction healing process and significantly improved the healing quality of BTJ injury. ? 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose:?? To determine the outcome of patients who had ultrasound detected, but no evidence of clinical correlation. Methodology:?? In a single surgeon practice, all the patients referred by General Practitioners between Aug 2007 to June 2008 with an ultrasound suggesting inguinal hernia, but with no clinical correlation were included. All of them were managed non-surgically. Telephone interviews were conducted to assess the outcome in 16 out the 19 patients eligible for the study. Median follow-up was eight months. Results:?? Pain in the inguinal region was the predominant symptom at presentation. Seven patients had become pain free within two weeks of the initial consultation. The remaining 9 patients had residual pain; 5 patients noticed improvement, 1 patient felt no change and 2 patients had other diagnosis made for their symptoms. No patient chose to see another specialist or had an operation for the management of the initial presentation. Conclusion:?? Fourteen out of sixteen (87.5%) patients who had an ultrasound demonstrating the presence of an inguinal hernia, with no clinical correlation, had improvement or resolution of their pain. This study demonstrates the importance of non surgical management in patients with groin pain and ultrasound detected inguinal hernia but with no clinical correlation.

AB  - Background? Abdominal donor site flaps, including the Transverse Rectus Abdominis Musculocutaneous (TRAM) and Deep Inferior Epigastric Artery (DIEA) perforator flaps, are the standard in autologous breast reconstruction. With variation in the vascular anatomy of the abdominal wall, preoperative imaging is essential for preoperative planning and reducing intraoperative error. Ultrasound has been used previously with varying results, and the quest continues for optimal preoperative assessment. Computerised Tomography Angiography (CTA) has been recently proposed as a non-invasive modality for this purpose. This is the first study to formally compare preoperative Doppler ultrasound with CTA for imaging the DIEA. Methodology? Eight consecutive patients undergoing DIEA perforator flaps for breast reconstruction undertook both CTA and Doppler ultrasound preoperatively. All investigations and procedures were undertaken at the same institution with the same surgeon and radiology team. Results? CTA was superior at identifying the course of the DIEA, its branching pattern and in visualizing its perforators than Doppler ultrasound. Preoperative CTA was highly specific (100%) and more sensitive in mapping and visualising perforators (p?<?0.001). CTA was also proficient at identifying the superficial epigastric arterial system and for effectively displaying the results intraoperatively. CTA was substantially quicker and removed the inter-observer error associated with Doppler ultrasonography. The study was ceased after eight patients due to the overwhelming benefit of CTA over Doppler. Conclusions? CTA is a valuable imaging modality for the preoperative assessment of the donor site vascular supply for TRAM and DIEA perforator flaps.

AB  - Purpose of the study:? We wish to report the case of a 5-year-old boy who had an interscalene catheter placed under ultrasound guidance. There is low level evidence to support the use of ultrasound when performing peripheral nerve blocks in adults and children. We will discuss the technique and an unusual complication with the catheter. Methods:? A 5-year-old, 20 kilogram, ASA I child was scheduled for a humeral osteotomy. Following induction of general anaesthesia an interscalene catheter was placed using both a nerve stimulator and ultrasound guidance. The catheter threaded easily and a dose of 7?ml 0.5% Ropivicaine was injected down the catheter, followed by another 3?ml at the end of surgery. Results:? The child had a successful sensory block and required only simple analgesia (oral paracetamol and ibuprofen) post-operatively. Of interest we were unable to elicit appropriate muscle twitches with the nerve stimulator despite good visualization of the brachial plexus and needle with the ultrasound. In addition, after a short period post-operatively we were unable to inject local anaesthetic down the catheter and it was subsequently removed. Following removal we found blood clot occluding all but one of the catheter side holes. Conclusions:? Ultrasound guidance was used to place an interscalene catheter in a 5-year-old?to date, the smallest child having this procedure in our hospital. Although the block was successful the catheter became occluded by clot. We have been unable to find other reports of this problem in the literature. Using ultrasound has the potential to reduce the risk of complications when placing interscalene catheters, particularly in children. Furthermore, this case illustrates that the use of a nerve stimulator may not guarantee adequate localization of the nerves during neural blockade.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Morphological abnormalities of the levator ani are found in a significant minority of women presenting with symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction. In this study quantification of such injuries using tomographic three-dimensional (3D) pelvic floor ultrasound was attempted. Methods In a prospective observational study undertaken at two tertiary urogynecological clinics, 262 consecutive women referred for complaints of lower urinary tract dysfunction and prolapse underwent an interview, clinical assessment and 3D translabial ultrasound imaging. Blinded offline analysis of volume datasets was performed at a later date using 4D View software. Main outcome measures were craniocaudal and ventrodorsal extent of defects of the pubovisceral muscle. Results Avulsion injuries were diagnosed in 50 women (19%; 21.3% of the vaginally parous). Defects were found unilaterally (right, n = 17; left, n = 12) and bilaterally (n = 21). In some women they affected the entire volume; in others defects were visible in only two of 16 slices. Hiatal area on Valsalva was correlated weakly with defect score (r = 0.28, P = 0.05) and total defect width (r = 0.4, P = 0.005). Defect score (P = 0.001) and maximum width (P = 0.002) were significantly higher in women who presented with symptoms of prolapse. Defect score was associated with cystocele as assessed clinically (P = 0.021) and on ultrasound (P = 0.014). Conclusions Depth and width of levator ani defects can be quantified by tomographic pelvic floor ultrasound. These parameters are associated with the likelihood of symptoms of prolapse and cystocele descent, but not with incontinence. Copyright ? 2007 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background A feared complication of thyroid fine needle aspiration (FNA) is bleeding diathesis and haematoma at the biopsy site. Patients are often advised to discontinue antithrombotic/anticoagulant (AT/AC) medications prior to the procedure. The aim of this study was to examine the risk of bleeding in patients on AT/AC medications undergoing cervical ultrasound (US)-guided FNA. Methods A retrospective chart review of 803 patients who underwent US-guided FNA of thyroid nodules over 8 years by a single endocrine surgeon was undertaken. Clinical variables, patient demographics and use of AT/AC medications were collected and analysed. The principle outcome measures included the incidence of procedure-related haematoma formation. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate the possible independent association between post-FNA haematoma and anticoagulation, adjusting for age, African American race, body mass index, vascularity and lesion size. Results A total of 1568 lesions were included in 803 patients. The mean age for the patients on AT/AC was 63.0 ± 10.4 years and those not on AT/AC was 50.1 ± 14.2 years (P < 0.001). Of those, 148 patients had 336 lesions (21%) biopsied while taking one or more daily AT/AC agent (81 patients: aspirin; 11 patients: Plavix; 17 patients: aspirin and warfarin; 30 patients: aspirin and Plavix; seven patients: rivaroxaban and aspirin; and two patients: ticagrelor and aspirin). Three patients (0.89%) in the AT/AC group compared to six patients (0.49%) not receiving AT/AC medications developed a haematoma (P = 0.41). All complications were treated conservatively and none required intervention. Conclusions US-guided FNA of thyroid lesions can be safely performed on patients taking AT/AC including newer agents, without an increase in adverse outcomes or decreased diagnostic rate. Further larger prospective multi-institutional studies are warranted to further investigate this important finding.

AB  - Summary The restoration of a tooth or teeth damaged by trauma can be challenging. The hydrophobic dimethacrylate monomer or its derivations, such as urethane dimethacrylate (UMDA) form the basis of modern day composite resins. Other components include inhibitors, to prevent premature resin polymerisation and colour stabilizers. The reattachment approach can be used for both uncomplicated and complicated crown fractures. The concept of working from final form is crucial to allow the clinician to carefully control the composite build-up. The key to an aesthetic Class IV build-up can be broken down into four elements: shape, shade, surface texture, and polishing. The chapter presents the clinical sequence followed in the tooth restoration. Final bonding of the porcelain restoration can then be carried out to optimise the enamel, by etching for 30 seconds, washing, and drying thoroughly before applying bond and curing.

AB  - Abstract Penetrating thoracic trauma is relatively uncommon when compared to other types of veterinary trauma, although prompt identification and emergency evaluation are necessary as injuries may be life-threatening. Emergency triage (see Chapter 2) is prudent to ensure patient stabilization prior to pursuing additional diagnostics. Surgical exploration is likely indicated, particularly in cases of gunshot wounds or when patient comfort or stability is compromised by the degree of the injury. Resolution of hypovolemic shock, improving respiratory function, and analgesia are the key aspects of emergency room stabilization. Hemothorax and pneumothorax are common and thoracocentesis can be an important part of management of these patients. Outcome with treatment is generally fair to good, depending on the cause of the wound; however, particular situations (high-velocity gunshot wounds) have been shown to have a worse prognosis.

AB  - Summary This chapter begins with an introduction of the anatomy of the ankle and foot. Appropriateness criteria for imaging foot and ankle trauma are then discussed. The ankle and foot are anatomically distinct from each other and therefore radiographic evaluation of each is different from the other. Standard ankle radiographs include anteroposterior (AP), lateral, and mortise view, and foot radiographs include AP, lateral, and oblique views. Computed Tomography (CT) is used for pre-operative planning in patients with complex distal tibial and malleolar fractures, tarsal fractures and Lisfranc fracture-dislocations. Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging is indicated in assessment of radiographically occult stress and insufficiency fractures. In the setting of foot and ankle trauma, ultrasound is often performed to evaluate the Achilles tendon for the presence and severity of a tear. The key to interpreting ankle and foot radiographs is familiarity with normal anatomy and injury patterns that may involve the ankle and foot.

AB  - Objectives To describe the CT findings in a population of dogs with multi-centric lymphoma that involved the spleen and liver. Materials and Methods Clinical records between January 2008 and June 2015 were reviewed. Thoracic and abdominal CT examinations of patients diagnosed with multi-centric lymphoma were evaluated by a board-certified radiologist. A diagnosis of multi-centric lymphoma with splenic and hepatic involvement was based upon cytological identification and immunophenotyping of neoplastic lymphocytes in cellular samples harvested from a peripheral lymph node, the spleen and the liver. Results Twelve dogs were included in this study, of which 11 had B-cell lymphoma; immunophenotyping was inconclusive in one dog. The spleen appeared normal in seven dogs and nodules were identified in five dogs. Splenic nodules were hypoattenuating in four of five dogs and isoattenuating in one of five. After contrast administration, three of five appeared hypoattenuating and two of five isoattenuating. The liver appeared normal in 10 dogs and hepatic nodules were identified in two dogs. All hepatic nodules were isoattenuating before contrast and hypoattenuating following contrast administration. Clinical Significance The CT appearance of the spleen and liver was normal in the majority of dogs with multi-centric lymphoma. Fine needle aspiration of the spleen and liver is recommended when using CT to stage dogs with multi-centric lymphoma.

AB  - Summary This chapter explores the strengths and weaknesses of the radiological investigations used to investigate suspected abusive head trauma in children. Advice is offered regarding investigations that might reasonably be used in different clinical scenarios. Common misunderstandings, controversies and pitfalls that may arise if radiological findings are misinterpreted are discussed. The forensic significance of these findings is examined, with particular reference to estimates of time of injury and the range of possible explanations for these findings (e.g., the presence of extra-axial fluid around the brain). Forensic practitioners and radiologists are cautioned to avoid over-confidence regarding estimates of time of injury on the basis of fluid densities. Consideration must be given to minimizing confirmatory bias. The authors recommend that radiologists specifically mention in their reports the range of possible explanations for forensically important findings.

AB  - Purpose? Decision making in the management of combined major skeletal and soft tissue trauma to the lower limb is a complex process made more difficult by the uncertainty surrounding outcomes. The aim of this study is to review and present our experience with flap reconstruction of traumatic lower limb defects, with particular reference to in-hospital complications and outcomes related to timing, choice of flap and pre-existing complications. Methodology? Retrospective review of all lower limb flap reconstructions performed by the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Unit at the Alfred Hospital (largest trauma centre in Australasia) from 1 July 2001 to 20 October 2005 (51 month period). Results? Sixty-four patients had 83 flap reconstructions (35 free, 48 local) of 70 separate lower limb injuries. Twenty-seven flaps (32.5%) developed soft tissue infections and 16 fixation devices (25.8%) were complicated by deep metal infection. There were 6 (12.5%) local flap partial necrosis and 4 (11.4%) free flap failures. Three patients underwent secondary amputation during their initial admission. Thorough wound debridement and internal skeletal fixation were followed by earlier soft tissue coverage and lower deep metal infection rates. Limbs in which flaps were performed after Day 5 were more likely to develop deep metal infection (p?=?0.04) and suffer free flap failure or local flap partial necrosis (p?=?0.02). Conclusion? The current study presented our experience with flap reconstructions of complex lower limb injuries at a major trauma centre. Thorough wound debridement, internal fixation and early soft tissue coverage (within 5 days of injury) is associated with lower infection rates and optimal outcomes.

AB  - SUMMARY One hundred and ninety-five magnetic resonance (MR) images (1.5 Tesla) of 167 patients with neurological impairment following spinal trauma were reviewed. Acute cord injury produces central haemorrhagic necrosis that extends transversely and longitudinally with time and increased injury severity. Oedoma is more homogeneous, extensive and dominant in minimal lesions. Magnetic resonance appearances correlate with neurological status and outcome. Patients with MR evidence of cord blood had severe clinical lesions and failed to show useful clinical improvement. Patients with homogeneous ?oedema?improved to useful function. Lesion signal inhomogeneity relates to a worse prognosis. The clinical level correlates closely with cord blood or signal in homogeneity but imprecisely with homogeneous oedema. Disc herniations require differentiation from epidural blood and venous engorgement, which are prominent with bone displacement. Magnetic resonance is recommended in incomplete cord syndromes and in cord injuries with no apparent fracture, particularly if clinically deteriorating. Chronic injury consists of cavitation, extensive gliosis, cord atrophy and leptomeningeal fibrosis. Progressive myelopathy may result from cystic or non-cystic intramedullary lesions. Cord cysts are common and cyst fluid signal should closely follow cerebrospinal fluid. Turbulent cyst fluid motion is commoner in larger cysts and may predict those cysts more prone to propagate. Progressive syrinxes show typical appearances, usually with transverse septa. Atrophy and propagating syrinxes usually take years to develop. Leptomeningeal cysts and spinal stenosis caused by bone displacement and accelerated adjacent disc disease may cause late deterioration. In progressive myelopathy following injury, surgically drainable cysts are clearly differentiable from cord gliosis and atrophy.
