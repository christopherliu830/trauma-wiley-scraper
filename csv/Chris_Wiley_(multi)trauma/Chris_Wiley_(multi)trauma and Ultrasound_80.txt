AB  - Summary Anesthetic equipment failures are a potential source of serious patient morbidity, including but not limited to, hypoxia, brain injury, anesthetic overdose, and even death. A complete and thorough check of equipment is essential for safe delivery and monitoring of anesthesia. Some components should be checked before each anesthesia session (i.e. daily), while others should be checked prior to each case. In this chapter, safety checks of the high-pressure system, low-pressure system, scavenging system, breathing circuit, ventilators, airway equipment, drug delivery systems, monitors, and other equipment are described. A solid understanding of anesthetic equipment must be obtained before these checks can be performed adequately. A simplified checklist is included, which can be printed and posted in the anesthesia workspace or attached to each anesthesia machine. Regular preventative maintenance is discussed and may minimize equipment-related complications and costs.

AB  - Summary Iliac arteriovenous fistulas are an uncommon condition, which may be spontaneous or traumatic in nature. Such fistulas classically present with a triad of high-output cardiac failure, pulsatile abdominal mass with a bruit and unilateral leg ischaemia or venous congestion. We describe a case of an iliocaval fistula secondary to rupture of a common iliac artery aneurysm, with an unusual presentation of multiple organ failure, masquerading as sepsis. We describe the CT findings of iliocaval fistula, which was the means of diagnosis in this study.

AB  - Hospital acquired infections (HAI) are a major source of morbidity and mortality in human and veterinary hospitals. Research in human hospitals has shown that well focused staff education is an important step in limiting the development of HAI. Our hospital currently has no training program with respect to HAI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the general knowledge of hospital staff concerning HAI as the first step in developing a hospital wide education program. Ninety doctors and technicians were given a questionnaire containing 15 questions about HAI. The questionnaires were hand distributed and immediately completed. Ten of the questions tested knowledge of HAI, while five questions concerned the individual's perception of HAI in our hospital. Answers were given as a range from strongly agree to strongly disagree or in the form of multiple choice. With respect to their perception of HAI, 66% of technicians and 50% of doctors believed that they possess a good working knowledge of HAI. Several areas for improvement in hospital staff knowledge were identified. Technicians were more likely than doctors to incorrectly believe that 1) routine environmental cultures are effective at preventing HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 30%, doctors 52%), 2) that all animals that aspirated gastric contents under anesthesia develop clinical evidence of pneumonia (percent correct answer: technicians 55%, doctors 84%), and 3) that animals with an indwelling urinary catheter should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics (percent correct answer: technicians 51%, doctors 90%). In addition, doctors were more likely to identify Amikacin as the antibiotic of choice for patients with HAI in our hospital (percent correct answer: technicians 27%, doctors 79%). Neither group was able to adequately identify the patients in the ICU as the primary reservoir for the multi-drug resistant pathogens that cause HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 20%, doctors 15%). The discrepancy in knowledge between the two groups is likely explained by attendance of faculty, residents, and interns at one or more continuing education rounds sessions where HAI were discussed. This finding is contrary to what is frequently found in human hospitals where the nursing staff typically demonstrates superior knowledge of HAI when compared to doctors. The results of this study demonstrate that knowledge of HAI is not optimal in both the doctors and technicians in our hospital. Further better focused efforts are warranted to address the educational shortcomings evidenced by this study.

AB  - The severely of skin loss and the options of resurfacing is determined by taking into account the following factors. 1) The size & location of the defect, 2) The depth of the defect and the quality of the tissue bed, 3) The extent of exposed vital structures, 4) The associated bone and other tissues injuries, 5) The availability of donor skin flap. The size of the defect is the most important factor in choosing a resurfacing option. The size can be categorized into small, medium and large. A small defect is one that is less than 5?cm2 in size, a medium defect is between 5 to 15?cm2, and a large defect is greater than 15?cm2. Local flaps are usually sufficient to cover small defects <5?cm2. These are advancement flaps or rotation and transposition flaps. Regional flaps are indicated to resurface these medium-sized defects 5 to 15?cm2. The donor is within the same region of the hand, from one of the digits or from dorsum and palmar surfaces of the hand. It is usually based on vascular or NV pedicles. Large defects >15?cm2 will need larger flaps for coverage. These large flaps are pedicled distant flaps and free flaps. In these severe injuries, there is usually associated bone and soft tissues injuries. These injuries can be reconstructed as a single stage combined reconstruction or multi-staged reconstructions. The resurfacing should always be given priority.

Nevertheless, there are several important areas of controversy with regard to the surgical approach, differences of which may impact the rate of success and the incidence of adverse effects. Cognitive sequelae of temporal lobe surgery may result from (1) resection or transgression of the lateral (neocortical) temporal lobe or the temporal stem, which may lead to impairment in learning, and/or (2) resection of mesial structures, which may lead to decline in material-specific memory. The recent multi-center clinical trial analyzing the predictors of post-surgical quality-of-life will be discussed, including the finding that improvement depends on seizure-freedom irrespective of the occurrence of verbal memory decline. Nevertheless, it is incumbent on surgeons to minimize the occurrence of these cognitive sequelae while maximizing the possibility of seizure-freedom. Several approaches to gain access to the mesial structures will be compared with regard to cognitive outcome, including anterior temporal lobectomy (standard vs. tailored), trans-cortical selective AH and trans-sylvian selective AH, which differ in terms of their disruption of the temporal neocortex and temporal stem. Alternative approaches to the mesial resection will be compared with regard to seizure-free rates and the incidence of post-surgical decline in memory, including tailoring the hippocampal resection to the presence of inter-ictal epileptic spikes vs. performing a standardized resection, and the influence of the amount of hippocampal tissue resected. Open discussion of recent results addressing these important issues will hopefully either propel the field towards consensus, or highlight the need for further randomized clinical trials to improve patient outcome following amygdalo-hippocampectomy for MTLE.

AB  - A four-year-old neutered male bichon frise was presented for the evaluation of chronic, progressive yet episodic neurological dysfunction that was predominantly cerebellar in nature. Diagnostic testing including haematology, serum chemistry, magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis and urine organic acid screening was normal. Trial therapies with phenobarbital, prednisone and acetazolamide were unsuccessful. Treatment with 4-aminopyridine led to complete resolution of the signs.

AB  - Abstract Objective To compare the analgesic efficacy of bupivacaine, bupivacaine + morphine, or bupivacaine + dexmedetomidine administered epidurally in dogs undergoing pelvic limb orthopedic surgery. Study design Prospective, randomized, double blinded clinical trial. Animals Sixty dogs weighing (mean ± SD) 35 ± 15.7 kg, aged 5 ± 3 years. Methods Dogs were assigned to receive a lumbosacral epidural containing bupivacaine (B) 0.5%, 1 mg kg?1; B, bupivacaine 0.5%, 1 mg kg?1 + morphine 1%, 0.1 mg kg?1; B + M, or bupivacaine 0.5%, 1 mg kg?1 + dexmedetomidine 0.05%, 4 ?g kg?1; B + D. The anesthetic protocol was standardized. The median expired isoflurane concentration (E?Iso) and requirement for additional induction agent preventing purposeful movement were recorded. Pain was scored using visual analog (VAS) and modified University of Melbourne (UMPS) pain scales. Sedation was assessed using a 0?4 scale. All parameters were recorded preoperatively, and at extubation (t = 0), then at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20?24 hours. Hydromorphone was administered postoperatively to patients with a VAS ≥ 35 and/or UMPS ≥ 9. Time to first voluntary urination and first motor activity were recorded. Results Postoperatively, B + D had a lower UMPS pain score than B at t = 1 hour (p = 0.013), but not compared to B + M. The B + D group had a shorter time to urination (p = 0.0131) and a longer time for return of motor function (p = 0.0068). There were no other differences between the treatments. Conclusion and clinical relevance Epidurally administered B, B + M, or B + D in dogs all provided acceptable analgesia to manage post-operative orthopedic pelvic limb pain. Epidural administration of B + D is an effective alternative to the analgesia provided by B or B + M, but is associated with increased time to return of motor function. The direct neurotoxic effects of epidural dexmedetomidine have not been fully tested.

AB  - Summary.? Physiotherapy and radiography of the joints are standard diagnostic strategies for assessment of haemophilic arthropathy. The use of ultrasonography as an adjunct tool for early diagnosis of haemophilic arthropathy may optimize factor replacement therapy. The objective of this study was to compare costs and effectiveness of physiotherapy, radiography and ultrasonography (intervention strategy, IS) with physiotherapy and radiography alone (standard care strategy, SCS) for diagnosing soft tissue and osteocartilaginous changes in haemophilic joints. We retrospectively compared costs and effectiveness of IS vs. SCS in knees, ankles and elbows of 31 children (age range, 4?17?years) with haemophilia A (n?=?30) or B (n?=?1) (IS, n?=?11; SS, N?=?20). Direct health care costs were measured from the provincial health care perspective. Effectiveness was measured by false-negative (FN) rates in each study arm by comparing presence or absence of abnormalities of physiotherapy and imaging exams to the reference standard measure (MRI). In scenario 1, all diagnostic tests matched with MRI. In scenario 2, at least one diagnostic test matched with MRI. The IS was more costly [incremental cost/100 patients, Canadian (CND) $4987] and more effective (incremental effectiveness, FNs/100 patients for scenario 1, ?4.09, and for scenario 2, ?41) for both scenarios. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for scenario 1 and for scenario 2 were CND$1166 and CDN$116 per FN result averted per 100 patients, respectively. In conclusion, in the short-term, the incorporation of ultrasonography in a test set for diagnosis of haemophilic arthropathy substantially improved the diagnostic performance of this test set, however at an increased cost.

AB  - Background:? The aim of this study was to determine the outcomes of a contemporary amputation series. Methods:? A retrospective audit of 87 cases of major lower limb amputation from January 2000 to December 2002 from the Department of Vascular Surgery, Royal Perth Hospital, was conducted. Results:? The mean age of the study population was 70.1?±?14.3?years; the male?:?female ratio was 3.35:1. Comorbid problems included diabetes (49.4%), smoking (81.6%), hypertension (77.0%), ischaemic heart disease (58.6%), stroke (25.3%), raised creatinine level (34.5%) and chronic airway limitation (25.3%). Preamputation vascular reconstructive procedures were common, 34.5% in a previous admission and 23.0% in the same admission. The main indication was critical limb ischaemia (75.9%) followed by diabetic infection (17.2%). There were 51 below-knee (58.6%), 5 through-knee (5.7%) and 31 above-knee (35.6%.) amputations. The below-knee amputation to above-knee amputation ratio was 1.65:1. The overall wound infection rate was 26.4%; the infection rates for below-knee (29.4%) and above-knee (22.6%) amputation did not differ significantly (P?=?0.58). Revision rates were 17.6% for below-knee, 20% for through-knee and none for above-knee amputations. Twenty patients (23.0%) underwent subsequent contralateral amputation. Thirty-nine patients (44.8%) were selected as suitable for a prosthesis by a rehabilitation physician; 31 (79.5%) used the prosthesis both indoors and outdoors and 6 (15.4%) used it indoors only within 3?months. Cumulative mortality at 30?days, 6?months, 12?months and 24?months was 10.1, 28.7, 43.1 and 51.7%, respectively. Conclusion:? This series agrees with the current published work in finding that patients undergoing major lower limb amputation are older, with a high prevalence of comorbid conditions. Successful prosthesis rehabilitation depends on patient selection and a multidisciplinary approach. Despite a low immediate mortality, the overall long-term results of lower limb amputation remain dismal.

AB  - Objectives To report the clinical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging features, treatments and outcomes of canine vertebral chondrosarcoma. Materials and Methods Retrospective review of medical records of dogs with confirmed vertebral chondrosarcoma and magnetic resonance imaging of the lesions, from four different veterinary referral institutions. Results A total of six dogs were included in this report. In all cases, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lobulated mass involving the dorsal vertebral compartment, markedly hyperintense with few foci of hypointensity on T2-weighted images, iso to hypointense on T1-weighted images with contrast enhancement after gadolinium administration. Intralesional surgical resection was performed in three dogs and medical management in one, two dogs were euthanased and all lesions were submitted for histopathology. Magnetic resonance imaging findings correlated with histological findings of a low tumour grade. Rapid clinical improvement was noted after surgery but two of three dogs had local regrowth. Clinical Significance Chondrosarcomas show local aggressiveness and resistance to conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and so prognosis depends on feasibility of en bloc resection. Magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful in establishing a presumptive diagnosis and prognosis based on the feasibility of surgical resection.

METHODS Retrospective review of cases that had CT scan and subsequent retrieval of a grass seed during the same period of hospitalisation from a site included in the scan. RESULTS Records of 44 dogs and 10 cats were reviewed. Most were presented in the months July to December. Median duration of clinical signs was 4 weeks (range 2 days to 2 years). The most frequent clinical signs were soft tissue swelling (30% cases), coughing (28%), sneezing (28%) and discharge (26%). Grass seeds were retrieved from the thorax (35% cases), nasal cavity (31%), ear (7%), other sites in the head and neck (22%), sublumbar muscles (2%) and pelvic limb (2%). The grass seed was visible in CT images in 10 (19%) cases. Secondary lesions were visible in CT images of 52 (96%) cases, including collection of exudate (37%), abscess (24%), enlarged lymph nodes (22%) and pulmonary consolidation (20%). CT images appeared normal in 4% animals. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Grass seeds within the respiratory tract are frequently visible in CT images, but in general CT appears to be more useful for localisation of secondary lesions than as a method of definite diagnosis.
