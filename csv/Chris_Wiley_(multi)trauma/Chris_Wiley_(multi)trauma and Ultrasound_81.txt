AB  - Objectives To report clinical and laboratory features, treatment responses and outcome in dogs diagnosed with sterile steroid-responsive lymphadenitis in the United Kingdom. Materials and Methods Medical records of dogs diagnosed with sterile steroid-responsive lymphadenitis from 2009 to 2016 at six specialist referral centres were evaluated retrospectively. Results The study included 49 dogs. Springer spaniels appeared to be over-represented (16 of 49 dogs). Young dogs (median age: 3?years and 9 months) and females (31 of 49) were frequently affected. Clinical presentation was variable, with pyrexia (39 of 49), lethargy (35 of 49) and anorexia (21 of 49) the most commonly reported clinical signs. Lymph node cytology or histopathology demonstrated neutrophilic, pyogranulomatous, granulomatous or necrotising lymphadenitis without a detectable underlying cause in all cases. Because a sterile immune-mediated aetiology was suspected, all dogs received prednisolone, which was followed by rapid resolution of clinical signs and lymphadenopathy in most cases. Clinical Significance Sterile steroid-responsive lymphadenitis should be considered in dogs with pyrexia of unknown origin with inflammatory lymphadenopathy if no underlying cause can be found and often responds well to immunosuppressive corticosteroid therapy.

AB  - Background: Electrical isolation of pulmonary veins (PV) by radiofrequency (RF) ablation is often performed in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Current catheter technology usually requires the use of a multielectrode catheter for mapping in addition to the ablation catheter. Purpose: We evaluated the feasibility and safety of using a single, expandable electrode catheter (MESH) to map and to electrically isolate the PV. Methods and Results: Nineteen closed-chest mongrel dogs, weighing 23?35 kg, were studied under general anesthesia. Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) was used to guide transseptal puncture and to assess PV dimensions and contact of the MESH with PV ostia. ICE and angiography of RSPV were obtained before and after ablation, and prior to sacrifice at 7?99 days. An 11.5 Fr steerable MESH was advanced and deployed at the ostium of the RSPV. Recordings were obtained via the 36 electrodes comprising the MESH. For circumferential ablation, RF current was delivered at a target temperature of 62?65°C (4 thermocouples) and maximum power of 70?100 W for 180 to 300 seconds. Each animal received 1?4 RF applications. Entrance conduction block was obtained in 13/19 treated RSPVs. Pathological examination confirmed circumferential and transmural lesions in 13 of 19 RSPV. LA mural thrombus was present in 3 animals. There was no significant PV stenosis. Conclusion: Based on this canine model, a new expandable MESH catheter may safely be used for mapping and for PV antrum isolation. This approach may decrease procedure time without compromising success rate in patients undergoing AF ablation.

AB  - Background:? The aim of this study was to determine the outcomes of a contemporary amputation series. Methods:? A retrospective audit of 87 cases of major lower limb amputation from January 2000 to December 2002 from the Department of Vascular Surgery, Royal Perth Hospital, was conducted. Results:? The mean age of the study population was 70.1?±?14.3?years; the male?:?female ratio was 3.35:1. Comorbid problems included diabetes (49.4%), smoking (81.6%), hypertension (77.0%), ischaemic heart disease (58.6%), stroke (25.3%), raised creatinine level (34.5%) and chronic airway limitation (25.3%). Preamputation vascular reconstructive procedures were common, 34.5% in a previous admission and 23.0% in the same admission. The main indication was critical limb ischaemia (75.9%) followed by diabetic infection (17.2%). There were 51 below-knee (58.6%), 5 through-knee (5.7%) and 31 above-knee (35.6%.) amputations. The below-knee amputation to above-knee amputation ratio was 1.65:1. The overall wound infection rate was 26.4%; the infection rates for below-knee (29.4%) and above-knee (22.6%) amputation did not differ significantly (P?=?0.58). Revision rates were 17.6% for below-knee, 20% for through-knee and none for above-knee amputations. Twenty patients (23.0%) underwent subsequent contralateral amputation. Thirty-nine patients (44.8%) were selected as suitable for a prosthesis by a rehabilitation physician; 31 (79.5%) used the prosthesis both indoors and outdoors and 6 (15.4%) used it indoors only within 3?months. Cumulative mortality at 30?days, 6?months, 12?months and 24?months was 10.1, 28.7, 43.1 and 51.7%, respectively. Conclusion:? This series agrees with the current published work in finding that patients undergoing major lower limb amputation are older, with a high prevalence of comorbid conditions. Successful prosthesis rehabilitation depends on patient selection and a multidisciplinary approach. Despite a low immediate mortality, the overall long-term results of lower limb amputation remain dismal.

AB  - Objectives: To compare the accuracy of two ultrasonographic measurements, inner chorionic cavity diameter and biparietal diameter, for the prediction of parturition date in small and medium size bitches. The effects of litter size and fetal sex ratio on the accuracy of the prediction were also investigated. Methods: Ultrasonographic examinations were performed on pregnant bitches and, depending on the stage of pregnancy, the inner chorionic cavity diameter and biparietal diameter were measured. The mean value of the data of each structure was calculated and the predicted day of parturition was obtained by the application of equations derived from growth curves we previously developed for different size bitches. Results: The parturition term was predicted with similar accuracy during early gestation, by the measurement of inner chorionic cavity diameter, as well as during late gestation, by the measurement of biparietal diameter. Litter size affected only biparietal diameter accuracy, whereas fetal sex ratio did not influence the estimation of the day of parturition. Clinical Significance: Inner chorionic cavity diameter and biparietal diameter were equally reliable parameters in obtaining a reasonably accurate prediction of parturition date at any gestational period at which a bitch is examined.

AB  - Summary The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals estimates that 78 million dogs are owned in the United States. Approximately 68% of all households in the United States have a dog. Pet spending is easily at an all-time high?Americans were expected to spend more than $60 billion on their pets in 2017 (Manning, 2016). With the internet being so readily available, people who are interested in options and alternative treatments for their pet will search for the best source. With a little advanced preparation, that best source could be you. When starting a canine rehabilitation business, there are many factors to consider. Knowing some of your options in advance can help a start-up canine rehabilitation business become successful and profitable. This chapter is designed to provide foundational information and to present some of the important decisions and options to consider when initiating a new rehabilitation business or reshaping an existing one.

AB  - Abstract Objective Cataracts are the most common ocular disorder in dogs. Phacoemulsification is the preferred treatment method among ophthalmologists, but the cellularity of the endothelium must be considered for its success, as endothelial lesions may produce permanent corneal decompensation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of intracameral ascorbic acid, a known antioxidant, on the corneal endothelium of dogs undergoing phacoemulsification. Animal studied In all, 40 eyes from 20 dogs, males and females from 7 to 12 years of age, were assessed for mature cataracts. Procedures Two groups were formed (n = 20): Group 1 (G1) received a balanced salt solution (BSS), whereas Group 2 (G2) received sterile ascorbic acid diluted in a BSS, at a final concentration of 0.001 m ascorbic acid. The corneal endothelium was assessed via non-contact specular microscopy at multiple time points before and after phacoemulsification. Cell density (cells/mm2) and area (mm2), corneal thickness (mm), hexagonality, and the coefficient of variation of cell size were all assessed. P values equal to or less than 0.05 were considered significant. Results With respect to the density of endothelial cells, both groups showed losses, but they were less severe in G2. There were no differences in corneal thickness. Hexagonality decreased significantly in the postoperative period in G1. Also in G1, the coefficient of variation of cell size increased significantly. Conclusion According to the results obtained, ascorbic acid minimizes cellular losses in the corneal endothelium.

AB  - Summary Airway compromise can be fixed, dynamic (with varying degrees of collapse during the respiratory cycle), or exhibit both components. The location of the abnormality can be classified as extrinsic (located outside but exerting mass effect on the airway) or intrinsic (intramural and/or intraluminal). The etiologies of airway compromise are categorized as: congenital, infectious, inflammatory, traumatic, vascular, or neoplastic (1). The role of imaging of the airway is to determine the presence, nature and anatomic level of airway compromise, categorize it as intrinsic or extrinsic, provide a differential diagnosis, and guide further imaging or management (1). The differential diagnosis of a lesion takes into account the patient?s age and gender, location of the lesion, clinical presentation, and imaging appearance.

Abdominal exploration showed a large mass arising from the right ureter and a ureteronephrectomy was performed. Histopathology of the ureteral mass was consistent with a spindle cell sarcoma. The patient recovered well, but five months later was diagnosed with another tumour, this time in her left abdominal wall. The owners decided not to pursue further treatment and euthanasia was performed a month later.

AB  - Abstract The management of enteroatmospheric fistula (EAF) in open abdomen (OA) therapy is challenging and associated with a high mortality rate. The introduction of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in open abdomen management significantly improved the healing process and increased spontaneous fistula closure. Retrospectively, we analysed 16 patients with a total of 31 enteroatmospheric fistulas in open abdomen management who were treated using NPWT in four referral centres between 2004 and 2014. EAFs were diagnosed based on clinical examination and confirmed with imaging studies and classified into low (<200 ml/day), moderate (200?500 ml/day) and high (>500 ml/day) output fistulas. The study group consisted of five women and 11 men with the mean age of 52·6 years [standard deviation (SD) 11·9]. Since open abdomen management was implemented, the mean number of re-surgeries was 3·7 (SD 2·2). There were 24 EAFs located in the small bowel, while four were located in the colon. In three patients, EAF occurred at the anastomotic site. Thirteen fistulas were classified as low output (41·9%), two as moderate (6·5%) and 16 as high output fistulas (51·6%). The overall closure rate was 61·3%, with a mean time of 46·7 days (SD 43·4). In the remaining patients in whom fistula closure was not achieved (n = 12), a protruding mucosa was present. Analysing the cycle of negative pressure therapy, we surprisingly found that the spontaneous closure rate was 70% (7 of 10 EAFs) using intermittent setting of negative pressure, whereas in the group of patients treated with continuous pressure, 57% of EAFs closed spontaneously (12 of 21 EAFs). The mean number of NPWT dressing was 9 (SD 3·3; range 4?16). In two patients, we observed new fistulas that appeared during NPWT. Three patients died during therapy as a result of multi-organ failure. NPWT is a safe and efficient method characterised by a high spontaneous closure rate. However, in patients with mucosal protrusion of the EAFs, spontaneous closure appears to be impossible to achieve.

AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the demographics, clinical characteristics, diagnostic findings, underlying etiologies, treatment, and outcome associated with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP) in cats; and to identify clinical feature differences among cats with asthma associated secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (AASSP) versus nonasthma-associated secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (NAASSP). Design Retrospective case series. Setting University teaching hospital. Animals Sixteen client-owned cats with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Interventions None. Measurements and Main Results Domestic short hair was the predominant breed in this study (n = 15). The median age was 8 years old (range: 7 weeks to 17 years) with no sex predilection. Fourteen cats were affected by multi-lobar pulmonary pathology of infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic causes. Asthma was the most common cause of spontaneous pneumothorax (25%). Ten of 12 treated cats survived the initial episode of spontaneous pneumothorax to discharge with medical management, including all 4 cats with AASSP. Reoccurrence was documented in 4 cats. Pulmonary lobectomy was curative for 1 cat with congenital accessory lung lobe emphysema. No difference in clinical presentation was identified between cats with AASSP and cats with NAASSP. Conclusions Feline SSP is frequently associated with extensive pulmonary pathology. Supportive medical management is most appropriate, except in rare cases with focal congenital abnormalities that may benefit from surgical intervention. AASSP appears to carry a good prognosis for short-term outcome (survival to discharge). Clinical assessment, imaging, and invasive diagnostics were required to differentiate between AASSP and NAASSP.

AB  - Summary Reason for performing study: In human subjects with back pain, the deep spinal stabiliser m. multifidus is inhibited ipsilaterally leading to atrophy, asymmetry and intervertebral instability. Specific physiotherapeutic exercises are required to reactivate m. multifidus. This study assesses the effect of dynamic mobilisation exercises on size and symmetry of m. multifidus in the equine caudal thoracic and lumbar spine. Hypotheses: Regular performance of dynamic mobilisation exercises over a period of 3 months increases cross sectional area (CSA) and left-right symmetry of m. multifidus muscles in the caudal thoracic and lumbar spine. Methods: Eight horses performed dynamic mobilisation exercises (3 cervical flexions, one cervical extension and 3 lateral bending exercises to the left and right sides) with 5 repetitions/exercise/day on 5 days/week for 3 months during which time they were not ridden. Left and right m. multifidus CSA was measured ultrasonographically at 6 levels from T10 to L5 at the start (initial evaluation) and end (final evaluation) of the 3 month study. Changes in CSA of the right and left m. multifidus muscles and symmetry of m. multifidus CSA on the right and left sides between the 2 evaluations were sought using analysis of variance (P<0.05). Results: Between the initial evaluation and final evaluation m. multifidus CSA increased significantly at all 6 spinal levels on both right and left sides. Asymmetries in m. multifidus CSA between the right and left sides decreased between the initial and final evaluations. Conclusions: Hypertrophy of multifidus occurred over a 3 month period during which dynamic mobilisation exercises were the only exercise performed. Potential relevance: Dynamic mobilisation exercises maybe a useful rehabilitative technique for horses in which m. multifidus has atrophied in response to back pain.

AB  - Canine dysautonomia was diagnosed definitively in five dogs by histopathology. All dogs were seen between June 2004 and July 2006 and originated from south-east England; four dogs originated from an urban area and one from a rural area. Of the urban dogs, one had recently visited Scotland and one had visited a kennel in a rural area nearby. Acute-onset but progressive vomiting, diarrhoea, depression and inappetence were the most common presenting clinical signs. Reduced or absent anal tone, dysuria, absence of pupillary light reflexes with intact vision, mydriasis, decreased corneal sensitivity and nictitating membrane protrusion were among the most frequent neurological findings. Abnormalities in pharmacological autonomic and physiological function testing (including orthostatic hypotension in two dogs) and diagnostic imaging studies were detected in some of the animals. All dogs failed to respond adequately to treatment, and given the poor prognosis, they were eventually euthanased. Histopathology identified marked chromatolysis of ganglion cell bodies. This case series emphasises that dysautonomia should be considered when a dog is presented in the UK with acute- or subacute-onset gastrointestinal signs and compatible physical and neurological abnormalities.

AB  - Current protocols for root-end management in apical microsurgery are described. The dramatic increase in light and magnification as the advent of the surgical operating microscope (SOM) for use in endodontic apical surgery has caused a renewed examination of the rationale, indications, techniques, instrumentation, and materials for root-end procedures. Additional research and increased use of the SOM in endodontic surgery have elucidated many shortcomings of previous techniques. Root-end resection, root-end bevel, root-end preparation, and root-end filling are discussed. The steps necessary to achieve a predictable result in performing surgical root-end procedures using the enhanced vision of the SOM are presented.

AB  - Abstract Inflammation of the pancreas has many presentations in children and adolescents. The etiology is often elusive, with a great number of cases being idiopathic. However, there have been a number of recent advances in the areas of cell biology, genetics and imaging technology, which should be highlighted. Herein is provided a review for the reader with particular emphasis on some of these newer advances.

AB  - Abstract We report the first successful application of nonferromagnetic embolization coils for endovascular exclusion of a mycotic right subclavian artery aneurysm. A 58-year-old woman presented with acute cervical pain and a pulsatile mass in the right supraclavicular fossa under antibiotic medication for subacute infectious endocarditis. Diagnostic work-up including duplex sonography, digital subtraction angiography, and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a saccular aneurysm of the extrathoracic right subclavian artery. As an alternative to open surgery or stent-graft repair, this pathology was electively treated by transcatheter coil embolization. No neurological deficit or ischemic symptoms were noted during 9 months clinical follow-up. Multislice computed tomography scan revealed complete occlusion of the mycotic aneurysm 6 months after the interventional procedure. Transcatheter closure with Inconel embolization coils is a cost-effective and safe therapeutic option in patients with mycotic aneurysm originating from the subclavian artery. ? 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Objective Recent studies have shown that an elevated 1-h postload plasma glucose (1hPG) is able to identify subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) at high risk for future type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, clinical studies about the characteristics of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients with elevated 1hPG are lacking. The aim of this study was to analyse the 1hPG level in CHD patients with NGT. Methods A total of 204 CHD patients with NGT were recruited. Subjects underwent an oral glucose tolerance test, echocardiography and coronary angiography. Demographic data were recorded and blood samples obtained. According to the 1hPG cut-off point of 8·6 mm, patients were divided into two groups: 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm (n = 65) and 1hPG < 8·6 mm (n = 139). Results Compared with the 1hPG < 8·6 mm group, subjects with 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm had a worse metabolic profile, exhibiting significantly higher body mass index, systolic blood pressure, triglyceride level and lower HDL-cholesterol level. Plasma high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) levels were higher in the 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm group than in the 1hPG < 8·6 mm group. Coronary angiography revealed that single-vessel changes were more frequent in the 1hPG < 8·6 mm group, but there were no significant differences in the Gensini score. Conclusions Patients with CHD with 1hPG ≥ 8·6 mm have a worse metabolic profile, higher levels of hsCRP and multi-vessel coronary atherosclerosis. These findings suggest that, in patients with CHD, elevated 1hPG increases coronary risk factors and may be a marker for early-stage glucose intolerance.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To evaluate the activity and tolerability of three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) in dogs with massive hepatocellular carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS Six dogs with massive hepatocellular carcinoma that were ineligible for surgical resection or with owners who declined surgical resection, and underwent 3D-CRT were retrospectively reviewed. 6 to 10 Gy per fraction was prescribed at isocentre of planning target volume to a total dose of 18 to 42 Gy with 1 to 2 fractions per week for a total of 3 to 7 fractions. Follow-up examinations included physical examination, contrast-enhanced CT scan and blood analysis (complete blood count, electrolytes and serum biochemical panel). RESULTS The median follow-up time after 3D-CRT was 534 (range, 281 to 1057) days. An objective response was observed in five of six cases. Radiation-induced liver disease developed in one dog but was asymptomatic and reversible. Toxicity was not noted in any other dog. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE 3D-CRT appears to be a viable treatment option for dogs with inoperable massive hepatocellular carcinoma.
