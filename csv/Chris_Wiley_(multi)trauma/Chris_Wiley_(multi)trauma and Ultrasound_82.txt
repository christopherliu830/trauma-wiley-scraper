AB  - OBJECTIVES To evaluate the activity and tolerability of three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) in dogs with massive hepatocellular carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS Six dogs with massive hepatocellular carcinoma that were ineligible for surgical resection or with owners who declined surgical resection, and underwent 3D-CRT were retrospectively reviewed. 6 to 10 Gy per fraction was prescribed at isocentre of planning target volume to a total dose of 18 to 42 Gy with 1 to 2 fractions per week for a total of 3 to 7 fractions. Follow-up examinations included physical examination, contrast-enhanced CT scan and blood analysis (complete blood count, electrolytes and serum biochemical panel). RESULTS The median follow-up time after 3D-CRT was 534 (range, 281 to 1057) days. An objective response was observed in five of six cases. Radiation-induced liver disease developed in one dog but was asymptomatic and reversible. Toxicity was not noted in any other dog. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE 3D-CRT appears to be a viable treatment option for dogs with inoperable massive hepatocellular carcinoma.

AB  - Objectives To report the short- and long-term outcomes of one- or two-staged suture attenuation for complete closure of intrahepatic congenital portosystemic shunts in dogs. Materials and Methods Retrospective cohort study of dogs surgically treated for intrahepatic congenital portosystemic shunts between February 2000 and March 2015. Long-term follow-up was conducted by telephone conversations with the referring veterinary surgeon, owner, or both. Results In total, 55 dogs had suture attenuation of their intrahepatic congenital portosystemic shunt; 10 dogs (18·2%) tolerated complete attenuation, whilst 45 dogs (81·8%) tolerated partial attenuation. Postoperative complications occurred in 24 dogs (43·6%), and six dogs (10·9%) died. Repeat surgery was performed in 33 of 39 dogs (84·6%) that had previously undergone partial attenuation, and 27 of these (84·9%) ultimately achieved complete shunt attenuation. One dog (3·0%) died following second surgery, resulting in an overall postoperative mortality of seven of 55 (12·7%). Detailed follow-up was available for 22 dogs that were still alive at a median of 29?months after surgery (7·4 to 103·1) with a subjectively good quality of life. Of 17 dogs (82·4%), 14 with complete attenuation in one or two surgeries had an excellent outcome compared with one of five dogs (20%) with persistent shunting. Clinical Significance Staged suture ligation resulted in a high proportion of complete attenuation and reduced persistent shunting compared with a single surgery. Repeat surgery was associated with fewer complications than the first surgery. The proportion of dogs with an excellent outcome was greater for those that had complete attenuation in one or two surgeries compared with those with persistent shunting.

AB  - Abstract Purpose:? To evaluate the effect of micro-incision (2.2?mm) and small-incision (2.6?mm or 3.0?mm) coaxial phaco-emulsification on surgically induced astigmatism (SIA). Methods:? Cataract patients (n?=?83, 129 eyes) were randomized into three groups: 43 eyes in the 2.2-mm incision group, 42 eyes in the 2.6-mm group and 44 eyes in the 3.0-mm group. Torsional phaco-emulsification was followed by intraocular lens implantation via the Monarch II injector with the C cartridge (Alcon Laboratories Inc., Fort Worth, TX, USA). Corneal astigmatism, SIA and uncorrected distance visual acuity were assessed 30 and 90?days after cataract surgery. Results:? At 30 and 90?days postoperative, SIA of the 3.0-mm group was greater than SIA of the 2.2-mm and 2.6-mm groups (P?≤?0.015), but SIA was similar between the 2.2-mm group and the 2.6-mm group. Timewise, mean SIA at 30?days was greater than SIA at 90?days in the 3.0-mm group (P?=?0.04), while SIA did not change with time for the 2.2-mm and 2.6-mm groups. Postoperative uncorrected distance visual acuity tended to be better with the smaller incisions, but this trend did not reach stastical significance (P?≥?0.07). Conclusion:? Incision size contributed to postoperative corneal astigmatism. When incision size was reduced from 3.0?mm to 2.6?mm, SIA was reduced and refractive stabilization was faster. Reduction of incision size from 2.6?mm to 2.2?mm offered no greater reduction of SIA when using the C cartridge; however, the D cartridge (designed for 2.2-mm incisions) should be evaluated.

AB  - Background Most studies on sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) are either single-centre with small numbers of patients or multi-centre studies. We present the medium-term follow-up results from a single centre for 127 patients undergoing SNS. Methods Consecutive patients treated with SNS for faecal incontinence had preoperative baseline St Mark's continence scores, faecal incontinence quality of life (FIQL) measures and anorectal physiology studies. Follow-up was a postal questionnaire concerning continence, FIQL, patient-perceived change in bowel control (?5 to +5 where 0 is no change), overall satisfaction (0?10 visual analogue scale) and use of medications. Results A total of 166 patients underwent temporary nerve stimulation testing, of which 112 progressed to a permanent implantable pulse generator (IPG). Fifteen received an IPG without the testing phase, hence 127 patients in total. Fourteen had the IPG removed, four were deceased, leaving 109 for assessment; 91 (83%) responded to the survey. Mean follow-up was 2.7?years (range: 2?months?8.5?years). Mean baseline St Mark's continence score was 14.4, and mean follow-up score was 10.3 (P?<?0.01). FIQL improved in all domains (P?<?0.001). Patient-reported improved bowel control mean score was +3.2 (95% CI: 2.9, 3.55). Median satisfaction score was 8.0 (range: 0?10). Complications included 17 lead dislodgements, seven superficial infections, five infections requiring surgery and five repositioning of a rotated IPG. Thirty-two patients used loperamide and 34 used fibre supplements. Conclusion In this observational study, limited by the absence of a placebo control group, SNS significantly improved continence and quality of life, and patient satisfaction was high.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the feasibility of CT pulmonary angiography for identification of naturally occurring pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs using predefined diagnostic criteria and to assess the ability of echocardiography, cardiac troponins, D-dimers and kaolin-activated thromboelastography to predict the presence of pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs. Methods Twelve dogs with immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia and evidence of respiratory distress were prospectively evaluated. Dogs were sedated immediately before CT pulmonary angiography using intravenous butorphanol. Spiral CT pulmonary angiography was performed with a 16 detector-row CT scanner using a pressure injector to infuse contrast media through peripheral intravenous catheters. Pulmonary thromboembolism was diagnosed using predefined criteria. Contemporaneous tests included echocardiography, arterial blood gas analysis, kaolin-activated thromboelastography, D-dimers and cardiac troponins. Results Based on predefined criteria, four dogs were classified as pulmonary thromboembolism positive, three dogs were suspected to have pulmonary thromboembolism and the remaining five dogs had negative scans. The four dogs identified with pulmonary thromboembolism all had discrete filling defects in main or lobar pulmonary arteries. None of the contemporaneous tests was discriminant for pulmonary thromboembolism diagnosis, although the small sample size was limiting. Clinical Significance CT pulmonary angiography can be successfully performed in dogs under sedation, even in at-risk patients with respiratory distress and can both confirm and rule out pulmonary thromboembolism in dogs.

AB  - Synthesis of a contrast agent for biomedical imaging is of great interest where magnetic nanoparticles are concerned, because of the strong influence of particle size on transverse relaxivity. In the present study, biocompatible magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by co-precipitation of Fe2+ and Fe3+ salts, followed by surface adsorption with reduced dextran. The synthesized nanoparticles were spherical in shape, and 12?±?2?nm in size as measured using transmission electron microscopy; this was corroborated with results from X-ray diffraction and dynamic light scattering studies. The nanoparticles exhibited superparamagnetic behavior, superior T2 relaxation rate and high relaxivities (r1?=?18.4?±?0.3, r2?=?90.5?±?0.8?s?1 mM?1, at 7?T). MR image analysis of animals before and after magnetic nanoparticle administration revealed that the signal intensity of tumor imaging, specific organ imaging and whole body imaging can be clearly distinguished, due to the strong relaxation properties of these nanoparticles. Very low concentrations (3.0?mg Fe/kg body weight) of iron oxides are sufficient for early detection of tumors, and also have a clear distinction in pre- and post-enhancement of contrast in organs and body imaging. Many investigators have demonstrated high relaxivities of magnetic nanoparticles at superparamagnetic iron oxide level above 50?nm, but this investigation presents a satisfactory, ultrasmall, superparamagnetic and high transverse relaxivity negative contrast agent for diagnosis in pre-clinical studies.

AB  - There is an increasing number of inherited disorders in which excessive telomere shortening underlies the molecular defect, with dyskeratosis congenita (DC) being the archetypal short telomere syndrome. DC is classically described as a mucocutaneous triad of oral leukoplakia, nail dystrophy and abnormal skin pigmentation. However, excessive telomere shortening can affect almost any organ system, so the clinical manifestations are protean, including developmental delay, cerebellar hypoplasia, exudative retinopathy, aplastic anaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, idiopathic hepatic cirrhosis, head and neck cancer and dental abnormalities, and may be multi-systemic. Undiagnosed patients may be seen by essentially any medical subspecialist. Correct diagnosis is important to ensure appropriate management, and for initiating investigations to identify affected family members. Treatment is often supportive, with transplantation offering cure for pulmonary fibrosis or bone marrow failure. Higher rates of mortality and morbidity with transplantation often require regimen alterations, underscoring the need for correct diagnosis. Short telomeres result from mutations in genes essential for telomere maintenance (e.g. genes encoding subunits of the telomerase enzyme complex). Disease severity reflects not only the severity of the defect, but also the inheritance of short telomeres, giving rise to incomplete penetrance and genetic anticipation. Attendees of the inaugural Australian Short Telomere Syndrome Conference were updated on the current scientific and clinical understanding of these disorders, and discussed the best approach for management of these patients in the Australian context. This review will include recommendations from the conference and aims to increase awareness of short telomere disorders.

AB  - Summary This case report provides a clinical description of an epithelioid variant of haemangiosarcoma in a horse. Haemangiosarcomas are rare neoplasms in equids, and only recently have the pathological aspects of the epithelioid variant in horses been described. Despite performance of cytology and surgical biopsy, the ante mortem diagnosis was incorrect in this case, demonstrating the common problem with diagnosing this neoplasm due to the lack of overt vascular differentiation. Due to the deteriorating condition of the patient, no antineoplastic treatment was attempted. A post mortem computed tomography helped characterise the invasive nature of the tumour. Only with post mortem sampling was the diagnosis of epithelioid variant of haemangiosarcoma discovered.

AB  - Abstract Feeding problems are common even in typically developing infants and children. However, they are more frequent and persistent in children with developmental disabilities. This article will provide an overview of current literature and a rationale underlying the interventions used for children with cerebral palsy (CP) who have eating impairments (dysphagia). The review is not intended to be exhaustive, but papers were selected that highlight some of the issues and challenges of the field. Normal oral-motor development is briefly discussed to show how it may inform clinical practice in the understanding of feeding problems. Description of the risk factors and the nature and extent of eating impairments will show how interventions need to be specific to the severity of eating impairments. Examination of sensorimotor therapies, using oral stimulation exercises or an intra-oral appliance, will highlight the range of their effectiveness, as well as their limitations. Similarly, an examination of tube feeding, used for nutritional rehabilitation of the most severely affected children, will address the benefits, controversies as well as moral issues encountered by caregivers and professionals. Multi-center studies will be needed to obtain more homogeneous samples, large enough to address questions of early interventions and their subsequent effect on later development. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - A five-month-old female Jack Russell terrier was presented for investigation of acute lethargy, anorexia, coughing, respiratory distress and weakness. Examination findings included cyanosis, a grade 3 of 6 systolic heart murmur and prolonged capillary refill time. Radiography and echocardiography revealed severe pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale and right-sided heart failure. Indirect measurement of the systolic pulmonary artery pressure estimated pressures over 100 mmHg. Despite treatment the patient died. Post-mortem examination did not identify a congenital cardiovascular anomaly. Histopathology confirmed acute necrotising pulmonary arteritis and immunohistochemistry failed to identify any immune complex or complement deposition.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the physiological variables, arterial blood gas values, induction of anesthesia quality, and recovery quality using the combination of butorphanol, midazolam and alfaxalone in dogs. Animals Ten healthy adult Beagle dogs weighing 8.3 ± 3.1 kg. Methods Rectal temperature (T), pulse rate (PR), respiratory rate (fR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and arterial blood gases were measured and recorded prior to intravenous (IV) administration of butorphanol, prior to administration of both midazolam and alfaxalone IV 10 minutes later, then every 5 minutes for 20 minutes. M-mode echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) indices were measured before and 5 minutes after administration of alfaxalone. Qualitative scores for induction of anesthesia and recovery were allocated, duration of anesthesia and recovery were calculated, and adverse events were recorded. Results Scores for induction and recovery quality were excellent. No significant adverse events were observed. Mean ± SD time from induction to extubation and to standing (full recovery) was 29 ± 6 and 36 ± 8 minutes, respectively. There were statistically significant changes in PR, fR and MAP after drug administration. Transient hypercarbia developed after alfaxalone injection. The echocardiographic LV indices were reduced after alfaxalone injection, although those changes were not statistically significant. Conclusions and clinical relevance The combination of butorphanol, midazolam and alfaxalone provided excellent quality of induction of anesthesia and exerted minimal cardiopulmonary effects in healthy dogs.

AB  - Abstract Ardisiae Japonicae Herba is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of bronchitis conjunctivitis, pneumonia, and trauma. In this work, a high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry method was first established for the separation and structural identification of the chemical constituents in Ardisiae Japonicae Herba. A total of 15 compounds including coumarins, flavonoid glycosides, and catechins were identified or tentatively characterized based on their chromatographic behaviors and mass spectral fragmentation and by comparisons with the reference standards. Furthermore, a simple high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection method was developed for the simultaneous determination of five major constituents. Results obtained from method validation, including linearity, precision, repeatability, stability, and recovery, showed that the established method was reliable and accurate. Bergenin and quercitrin were found to be the most abundant constituents and could be served as chemical markers for quality control of Ardisiae Japonicae Herba.

AB  - Summary The veterinary rehabilitation team works towards a common goal: improving quality of life, relieving pain, and maximizing function for a patient, even in the light of physical impairments. The veterinary rehabilitation team can consist of a rehabilitation veterinarian, a rehabilitation veterinary technician, and a physical therapist trained in animal rehabilitation. The rehabilitation technician will assist the rehabilitation veterinarian, physical therapist, and any other adjunct professional with the examination. The physical therapist, trained in animal rehabilitation, will evaluate the patient with the rehabilitation veterinarian and document impairments in range of motion (including accessory joint motions), flexibility, strength, functional mobility, gait, and neurological function. Collaboration is a simple process when all team members are at the same facility and have direct access to the patient. Such collaboration leads to excellent patient care.

AB  - Abstract History A 10-year old Arabian mare had a slow-growing mass on the lower right mandible and required a large partial mandibulectomy. Physical examination No abnormalities were detected apart from the mass. Management A temporary tracheostomy was performed pre-operatively. Anesthesia was induced with xylazine followed by ketamine and diazepam. For 13 hours, anesthesia was maintained using sevoflurane, dexmedetomidine and remifentanil infusions, with the exception of surgical preparation time. Intra-operatively, ventilation was delivered through the cuffed tracheotomy tube. Heart and respiratory rates, ECG, arterial pressures, inspired and expired gases, pulse oximetry values and body temperature were monitored. Dobutamine and whole blood were necessary, and romifidine was used to control recovery. Post-operatively, phenylbutazone and buprenorphine given systemically and bupivacaine administered through a wound soaker catheter were used to provide analgesia. Head-shaking from buprenorphine was controlled with acepromazine and detomidine once standing after 87 minutes in recovery. For 3 days after surgery, analgesia was provided with butorphanol, phenylbutazone and bupivacaine. The mare recovered well, appeared comfortable and started eating the following day with no signs of ileus. Follow-up Seven months later, the mare was doing well. Conclusions Sevoflurane, dexmedetomidine and remifentanil infusions were suitable for a long and invasive procedure.

AB  - Summary Background Primary hyperparathyroidism is uncommon in equids. Objectives To describe the diagnostic findings and efficacy of treatment in equids with primary hyperparathyroidism. Study design Retrospective case series describing 16 horses and one mule. Methods Cases were identified by retrospective review of records at Cornell University and via an ACVIM listserv query. Inclusion criteria were an equid with hypercalcemia, normal renal function and high parathyroid hormone (PTH) or histopathological diagnosis of a parathyroid adenoma. Equids with normal PTH and PTH-related protein (PTHrP) in the face of hypercalcemia were included as suspect cases. Results The most common presenting complaints were weight loss (12/17) and hypercalcemia (10/17). PTH was above reference range in 12/17 cases. Suspected parathyroid tumours were localised in 12/14 equids imaged using ultrasonography alone (2/3), technetium 99m Tc sestamibi scintigraphy alone (1/1) or both modalities (9/10). Three horses did not have imaging performed. Surgical exploration successfully excised tumours in six of 10 cases. Five were located at the thoracic inlet, and surgery resulted in complete cure. One tumour was excised from the thyroid lobe, and the horse remained hypercalcemic. Four other cases explored surgically, four treated medically and three that were not treated also remained hypercalcemic. Main limitations The small study size prohibited statistical analysis. Conclusions Parathyroid adenomas in equids can be successfully localised with ultrasonography and scintigraphy. Surgical excision appears more likely to be successful for single gland disease at the thoracic inlet.
