AB  - Summary The cardiovascular effects of serial increasing infusions of dopexamine HCI were investigated in six conscious (1, 2, 4, 6, 10 ?g/kg bodyweight [bwt]/min) and eight (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20 ?g/kg bwt/min) halothane-anaesthetised horses. Dopexamine produced dose-dependent increases in heart rate, +dP/dtmax' -dP/dtmax and cardiac output, and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance in conscious and halothane-anaesthetised horses. Mean arterial blood pressure did not change in conscious horses but increased to a maximum value at 10 ?g/kg bwt/min in halothane-anaesthetised horses. Thereafter, median artery blood flow decreased. Ventricular arrhythmias occurred in two conscious horses during the infusion of 10 ?g/kg bwt/min dopexamine HCI. No cardiac arrhythmias other than sinus tachycardia were observed in halothane-anaesthetised horses. The administration of propanolol eliminated the haemodynamic response to the infusion of 5 and 10 ?g/kg bwt/min dopexamine HCI in halothane-anaesthetised horses. The haemodynamic effects of dopexamine HCI offer specific advantages over dopamine and dobutamine for the treatment of low cardiac output states in horses.

AB  - On behalf of the ?Blood Matters? Planning Group. The Blood Matters Collaborative was structured around a series of specific projects designed to improve distinct aspects of the sequence of care processes that ultimately determine the safety of each and every fresh blood product (red cell, platelet, fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate) transfusion. These commence with the appropriateness of the clinical decision to transfuse blood products, then move to ensure that procedures for patient, sample and blood product identification and blood administration are robust and that any procedural errors and adverse events associated with transfusion are captured, analysed and acted upon. Finally and very importantly the collaborative sought to improve the patient and carers understanding of the risks and benefits of transfusion. It was an ambitious program of work but there seemed little alternative other than addressing all of the interdependent processes that determine the quality and safety of transfusion. All elements in this chain contribute to the actual levels of transfusion safety. With support from the Clinical Innovation Agency and planning group members, local multi-disciplinary hospital teams set out to deliver changes to improve transfusion safety. The collaborative methodology, initially developed by the Institute of Healthcare Improvement in the United States of America, has been adopted and used by a large number of health systems internationally and within Australia. It is based on answering three key questions [Q1. What are we trying to accomplish? Q2. How will we know that a change is an improvement? Q3. What changes can we make that will result in improvement?] and testing ideas through the plan, do, study, act cycles of change. Individual projects monitored progress using ?run charts? to record their measured performance. These indicated progress towards achieving locally set targets and collaborative improvement goals. Our objectives were translated into tangible benefits for patients requiring blood product transfusion. Fundamental to the collaborative approach to improving transfusion practice is the belief that changes can be tested rapidly on a small scale without risk. For example, an idea can quickly be tried with one patient, one clinic or ward, a single consultant or hospital. Only if it proved successful was it suggested for wider adoption as an improvement in care across an entire Health Service or system of care. Our successes reinforced the value of using a systematic method for translating ideas into practice such as that used by the collaborative. The governance structures and teams established during our participation in the collaborative have helped us to identify key local issues and implement strategies to enhance the quality of our transfusion services to our patients. Our aim is to ensure that the continued review and improvement of transfusion practices becomes an integral part of the way that clinical teams and hospital and health system clinical governance structures work. The role of state or national bodies is to support this to happen. We hope to build a series of improvement partnerships that all focus on optimising the quality of transfusion services and the outcomes of patients receiving transfusion during their clinical care.

AB  - Objectives: To analyse the demographic information of dogs referred for investigation of fever, to determine the usefulness of various diagnostic investigations and to assess the effect of treatment before referral on the presence of fever at referral, the duration of the investigation and the ability to reach a final diagnosis. Methods: The clinical records of 66 dogs, in which fever was part of the clinical signs documented by the referring veterinary surgeon, were reviewed. The effects of treatment 24 hours before referral on temperature at initial consultation and on time to diagnosis were evaluated. The effect of body temperature at initial consultation on cost and on time to diagnosis was also determined. The effect of insurance on costs incurred was assessed. The utility of different diagnostic investigations was recorded, and cases were classified according to the final diagnosis. Results: Only 34·8 per cent of dogs were diagnosed with immune-mediated disease, with most frequent diagnoses being steroid-responsive meningitis and polyarthritis. Treatment 24 hours before referral significantly increased the time to diagnosis (P=0·004) and affected the presence of fever at referral (P=0·006). Insurance status did not significantly affect cost incurred by the owner. Clinical Significance: This study documents a high incidence of immune-mediated disease in dogs referred for investigation of fever. It also documents a higher incidence of inflammatory central nervous system disease in febrile dogs than that reported previously. Of the diagnostic modalities employed in the majority of cases, radiography, cytology and bacteriological and fungal cultures (fluids/tissues) were the most useful. It is suggested that treatment is withdrawn or withheld before commencing diagnostic investigation of fever.

AB  - Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) occurs in ≤12% of pediatric recipients of liver transplantation (LT). Known complications of PVT include portal hypertension, allograft loss, and mortality. The management of PVT is varied. A single-center, case-control study of pediatric LT recipients with portal vein (PV) changes after LT was performed. Cases were categorized as early PVT (if PVT was detected within 30 days of transplantation) or late PVT (if PVT was detected more than 30 days after transplantation or if early PVT persisted beyond 30 days). Two non-PVT control patients were matched on the basis of the recipient weight, transplant indication, and allograft type to each patient with PVT. Thirty-two of the 415 LT recipients (7.7%) received 37 allografts and developed PVT. In comparison with control patients, a higher proportion of patients with PVT had PVT present before LT (13.3% versus 0%, P = 0.01). Patients with early PVT usually returned to the operating room, and 9 of 15 patients (60%) had PV flow restored. Patients with late PVT had lower white blood cell (4.9 [1000/?L] versus 6.8 [1000/?L], P < 0.01) and platelet counts (140 [1000/?L] versus 259 [1000/?L], P < 0.01), an elevated international normalized ratio (1.2 versus 1.0, P < 0.001), and more gastrointestinal bleeding (25% versus 8.3%, P = 0.03) compared to controls. Patients with PVT were also less frequently at the expected grade level (52% versus 88%, P < 0.001). The patient survival rates were 84%, 78%, and 78% and 91%, 84%, and 79% for cases and controls at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The allograft survival rates were 90%, 80%, and 80% for cases and 94%, 89%, and 87% for controls at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. In conclusion, patients with early and late PVT had preserved allograft function, and there was no impact on mortality. Patients diagnosed with early PVT often underwent operative interventions with successful restoration of flow. Patients diagnosed with late PVT experienced variceal bleeding, and some required portosystemic shunting procedures. Academic delays were also more common. In late PVT, the clinical presentation dictates care because the optimal management algorithm has not yet been determined. Multi-institutional studies are needed to confirm these findings and improve patient outcomes. Liver Transpl 19:315?321, 2013. ? 2013 AASLD.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Little is reported about the successes and challenges experienced by veterinary surgeons while managing cases of laminitis. Such information could enhance the effectiveness of communication of management and preventive health strategies for laminitis. Objectives To explore veterinary surgeons? experiences of dealing with laminitis and examine how veterinary?client communication influences the treatment and management of cases. Study design Focus group discussions conducted among first-opinion equine veterinary surgeons. Methods First-opinion ambulatory veterinary practices from Cheshire (n?=?15), Lancashire (n?=?14) and the Rutland region (n?=?14) were identified. Letters of invitation were sent and all practices were telephoned to invite veterinary surgeons to participate in the study. Key questions relating to laminitis were explored within semi-structured focus group discussions: veterinary perceptions of laminitis information, reasons for horse-owners? seeking veterinary advice, veterinary perceptions of horse-owners? knowledge, attitudes and practices, situations where the advice of other professionals may be sought. All discussions were recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo software. Results Three focus group discussions were held with veterinary surgeons with a range of experience; 2 in the North West (9 vets) and one in Rutland (4 vets). Emerging themes relating to veterinary surgeons? experience of dealing with laminitis included; veterinary?client communication, challenges faced by vets, managing clients perceptions and expectations, client recognition and management of laminitis, feeding and obesity management, issues of compliance, causes of laminitis, strategies to prevent laminitis, diagnosing, treating and prognosticating in laminitis cases, sources of veterinary information and collaboration with other professionals. Conclusions The findings illustrate key features of the veterinary?client relationship in supporting owners through the variable course of this disease. This study demonstrates the complexity of issues that veterinary surgeons may encounter when managing cases of laminitis and communicating healthcare messages to the client.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Equine general anaesthesia carries a higher risk of perioperative fatality compared with humans and companion animals. Multiple studies have examined the risk factors associated with general anaesthesia, most notably the ongoing confidential enquiry into perioperative equine fatalities (CEPEF) studies initially published by Johnston et?al. [1]. Desflurane is a modern inhalational anaesthetic with low solubility and potentially beneficial reduced cardiorespiratory effects, but its use in a large number of horses has not been investigated. Objectives To evaluate the perioperative mortality rates of horses undergoing general anaesthesia maintained using desflurane. Study design Retrospective analysis. Methods Anaesthetic records of all horses undergoing general anaesthesia over a 4-year period at a single hospital were retrospectively examined. Horses were excluded if general anaesthesia was not maintained using inhaled desflurane. Outcome variables of dead (anaesthetic related), alive or euthanased (for other reasons) were recorded consistent with previous CEPEF studies. Results 427 horses met the inclusion criteria, of which 406 (95.1%) were alive at 7 days post operatively, 16 (3.7%) were euthanased and 5 (1.2%) died. Four of the perioperative fatalities suffered cardiac arrest, one suffered a catastrophic fracture. Mean age was 7.6 years (range 1 month?26 years), mean weight was 503.3?kg (range 60?828?kg). Mean duration of anaesthesia was 63.0?min (range 15?200?min). Mean recovery time to standing was 28.3?min (range 5?70?min) with mean recovery score 1.4/5 (range 1?4). Conclusions Use of desflurane led to comparable mortality rates to other inhalational anaesthetics in this small number of horses at a single hospital. Further multicentre studies with larger numbers are warranted to examine any potential benefits. Ethical animal research:?Ethical committee approval not currently required by this congress: retrospective study of clinical records. Explicit owner informed consent for participation in this study was not stated. Sources of funding:?None. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Treatment of equine lameness frequently requires a period of rest and restricted exercise. The financial impact of restricted exercise should be considered when making investigation and treatment decisions. Objectives To describe and quantify the cost and time commitment associated with horse maintenance in the UK and to quantify the incidence of lameness and number of days of exercise lost. Study design Online survey of UK horse owners. Methods An online survey was performed between June and November 2013. The questionnaire contained 35 open and closed questions related to 1) owner age, gender, geographical location; and 2) type and use of horse, purchase price, location, travel, healthcare and maintenance costs; and 3) lameness episodes within the last 12 months. Results 560 respondents fully completed the questionnaire, 98.2% were female aged between 16 and 54 years old. Horses (62.5% geldings, 37.1% mares, 0.8% stallions) were of mixed breed with a median age of 13 years. Horses were predominantly used for general purpose riding. Most horses were kept on or within 5 miles of the owner's residence (77.4%) and 65% of owners spent >10?h per week on horse maintenance. Median basic maintenance cost was £2660 per year or £7.29 per day including routine healthcare, dentistry, farriery, feed, housing, and insurance fees. Most horses (71.3%) experienced an episode of lameness within the previous 12 months. The median duration of restricted exercise (days wasted) was 70 (range 0?880) days. Conclusions This unique dataset quantifies the financial and time outlay required with horse ownership. Determining the number of wasted days and basic average cost per day has allowed us to quantify the cost of inactivity. Considerable cost is associated with a period of inactivity following an episode of lameness, which should be taken into account when considering investigation and treatment options.

AB  - Ligneous conjunctivitis and gingivitis were diagnosed in three related Scottish terrier dogs presented for investigation of severe conjunctivitis and respiratory signs. Hypoplasminogenaemia was confirmed in one of the three affected dogs. Supportive treatment was not effective, and the dogs died or were euthanased because of the disease. Post-mortem analysis of two of the dogs revealed multiple abnormalities including severe proliferative fibrinous lesions affecting the conjunctiva, gingiva, trachea, larynx and epicardium and multiple fibrous adhesions throughout the thoracic and abdominal cavities. One dog had internal hydrocephalus and lacked a cerebellar vermis. Ligneous membranitis was confirmed on histopathology. This is a rare condition in dogs but an important differential diagnosis for severe conjunctivitis and gingivitis.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Soaked grass hays are recommended for the nutritional-management of equine metabolic syndrome (EMS). Forage provision is commonly restricted to promote weight-loss and insulin-sensitivity. When EMS animals were fed hay at ?1.25% body mass (BM) as daily dry matter (DM) (presoaking) animals lost weight at 1.1% of outset BM weekly. This doubled weight-losses recorded when horses were fed fresh/?un-soaked? hay to the same level [1]. Objectives To compare the composition and digestibility of fresh/soaked grass-hays to improve nutritional-guidance for the management of EMS. Study design Following 6 weeks of dietary restriction to 1.25%BM as hay-DM, 6/12 horses which had participated in an earlier study [2], were used to determine the digestibility of the soaked (n?=?3) and fresh (n?=?3) hays. Methods Samples of fresh grass-hay (n?=?6) and hay from the same batch which had been water-soaked overnight (16?h, n?=?6) or by day (7?h, n?=?6) were dried for the measurement of DM content, pooled and ground. Nutrient and gross energy (GE) compositions were determined by proximate analyses. Animals were fed hay as 2 daily meals. Soaked-hay was equal-parts long/short-soaked. Apparent digestibilities were determined after total faecal collection for 72?h. Results Soaking hay; did not alter GE (17.6?MJ/kg DM), increased acid detergent fibre (ADF) (30?35%), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) (68?74%) and crude protein (CP, 8.4?10.6%), decreased water soluble carbohydrate (WSC, 18.2?12.2%), and mineral contents (5.7?4.2%). Digestibilities of GE, DM, ash, NDF and WSC were unaltered by soaking. Conversely, soaking increased CP (55.6?66.8%) and ADF (37.5?50%) digestibility. However, hay-soaking elicits un-quantified losses of DM. Previous studies report hay ADF and CP as ?water-insoluble?. When DM losses were retrospectively calculated from the ADF and CP content of fresh and soaked-hays, daily DM provision decreased from 1.25 to 1.14%. Consequently DE decreased by 25% (119.5?89.7?kj/kg BM/day). Conclusions Dry matter losses from hay-soaking have marked impacts on energy/nutrient provision and increase the severity of dietary restriction. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the University of Liverpool, Veterinary Research Ethics Committee. Owners gave informed consent for their horses? inclusion in the study.

AB  - Reasons for performing study To introduce and assess the feasibility of multipulse transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) in horses. Objectives To assess latency times of muscular motor evoked potentials (MEP) in the m. extensor carpi radialis (ECR) and the m. tibialis cranialis (TC), elicited by transcranially applied multipulse stimulation in 12 healthy horses. Study design Prospective observational study applied in 12 healthy horses. Methods Horses with a mean age of 11.0 (range 3.6?20.5) years and a height of 160 (s.d.?±?10.0) cm were studied. Horses were sedated with detomidin (1.5??g/kg bwt) and butorphanol (1.5??g/kg bwt) i.v. A subcutaneous ring block with lidocaine 2%?+?adrenaline was placed on the forehead. TES was performed using biphasic high frequency multipulse voltage trains (pulse width: 0.1?ms, interpulse interval: 1.3?ms, 3 pulses/train) applied to 2 subcutaneous needle electrodes bilateral from the centre of the forehead. Latency times (30?V above motor threshold (MT) and amplitude of MEP were recorded bilaterally at the ECR and the TC muscles. Motor latency times are expressed as mean?±?2?s.d. Results Mean latency times (at MT?+?30?V) for the ECR muscles were respectively 20.18?±?1.85?ms (left side) and 19.7?±?1.69?ms (right side) and for the TC muscles respectively: 34.6?±?2.01?ms (left) and 34.9?±?2.43?ms (right). Conclusions TES is well tolerated. Interestingly, recorded motor latency times at the level of front and hind legs appear to be shorter for TES when compared to TMS from literature data [1].

AB  - Reasons for performing study We have already demonstrated that vaccination with empty BPV1 capsids termed virus-like particles (VLP) protects horses from experimental infection with BPV1 virion. Long-term monitoring of antibody titres in experimental horses and data from other species suggest that this protection is long lasting. Objectives To test protection against experimental infection with BPV-1 virion in horses that were vaccinated with BPV-1 L1 VLP approximately 5 years earlier. Study design Controlled experiment. Methods Seven horses, vaccinated 3 times (boosters after 4 weeks and 6 months) in 2007/2008 with doses of BPV1 L1 VLP ranging from 50??g to 150??g/dose and 3 unvaccinated control horses were challenged by intra-dermal inoculation with cow wart derived BPV1 virion (5???107 BPV-1 virions per wheal, 10 wheals per horse). Inoculation sites were monitored for 10 weeks. Blood for serum antibody titre determination by pseudovirion neutralisation assay was taken on the day of challenge and after 6 months. Results Six of 7 vaccinated horses had measurable serum antibody titres (1:50 to 1:400). These titres were boosted by inoculation (about one step of dilution). Two of 3 unvaccinated controls remained sero-negative. One control horse showed sero-conversion. All control horses developed tumours at all 10 inoculation sites. Tumours appeared approximately 2 weeks after inoculation and reached maximum sizes of up to 8?mm. Regression was complete by 8 weeks after their first appearance in all horses. All vaccinated horses remained completely free from tumours. No influence of dose rate or antibody titre on the level of protection could be determined. Conclusions BPV-1 L1 VLP vaccination proves to be fully effective in protecting horses from experimental infection and tumour formation 5 years post immunisation. The protection was complete even in horses with low or unmeasurable antibody titres. This is another step towards establishing a vaccination against equine sarcoids.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Most complications in equine castrations result from insufficient ligation and contamination. Objectives Stapling instruments reduce tissue handling, decrease surgical time, minimise contamination and provide secure visceral and vascular closure when used correctly. Using a stapler device might therefore increase ligation security and decrease contamination, and by this, reduce the complication rate seen in routine castration. Study design The applicability and safety of a TA-30 premium stapler as a ligation method in castration of the horse was tested in 15 horses under general anaesthesia in dorsal recumbency. Three horses were cryptorchids, one horse suffered a scirrous chord, and one horse suffered an infectious orchitis. Methods The vaginal process was approached inguinally. A noncutting emasculator was applied to compress the closed vaginal process. Consecutively a TA-30 Premium stapler was applied to the compressed site. The distal part of the vaginal process was then removed, the stapler device was released and the incision was closed. The TA-30 stapler accommodates 3 different staple cartridges of 30?mm width, accommodating 1.0 to 2.5?mm tissue thickness. The thickness of the vaginal process after compression was measured to be 1.0?mm (0.9?1.1?mm) in 10 fresh specimens. The 30-V3 cartridges (triple row, 1?mm closed diameter) were chosen in 9 horses with smaller vaginal processes and the 30-3.5 cartridges (double row 1.5?mm closed diameter) in 6 other horses with larger vaginal processes. Results All horses recovered without intra- or post operative complications. Conclusions A TA-30 stapler is a safe ligation instrument in equine castrations. The use of titanium staples may reduce infection rate in routine castrations, even more in ligation of precontaminated vaginal processes in cases of post operative haemorrhage control after practice castrations or in closing the vaginal process after the removal of an infected testis or scirrous chord.

AB  - Reasons for performing study It is unknown how students develop lameness assessment skills. Objectives To quantify student performance, visual approaches and attitudes to lameness evaluation. Study design Comparison of student cohorts. Methods Twenty 3rd year (inexperienced cohort) and thirteen 4th to 5th year (experienced cohort) students evaluated 30 video clips showing horses on the straight line or circle, followed by a general questionnaire. Eyetracking records (Tobii X102) were collected in parallel. The percentage of correctly evaluated horses was calculated based on verified expert opinion. From the eyetracking records on the straight line, the percentage time spent on different regions on the horse was calculated and compared between cohorts. Results For both cohorts, while the correct detection of lameness per se was high (median ≥92%), detection of the correct limb was lower (median 40?80% depending on quarters and cohort) and detection of sound horses was at chance level (median?=?50%). The correct limb was indicated significantly more often by the experienced cohort (P?≤?0.032) except for forelimb lameness on the circle (P?=?0.053). The inexperienced cohort dedicated more time to looking at limb movement, while the experienced cohort focused on head and pelvis movement. Students judged their expected task performance realistically, on average underestimating themselves slightly by around 8%. The task difficulty was rated as a mean (s.d.) of 4.10 (0.48) out of 5 by the inexperienced and 3.35 (0.47) by the experienced cohort. Conclusions Lameness detection skills evolve and improve over the course of the curriculum, with a shift from limb assessment to upper body assessment. Students must learn to reliably determine soundness, and hindlimb lameness proved more difficult than forelimb lameness. Students find lameness detection comparatively difficult, but have a realistic understanding of their skill level, suggesting that they can determine their needs for further practice.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Measurement of incorporation of stable isotope-containing amino acids into muscle is the gold-standard technique for measuring muscle protein synthesis (MPS), but its use in horses has not been evaluated. Objectives 1) To establish a technique for measuring MPS?in vivo in the horse using a labelled amino acid tracer and 2) to determine basal MPS in the horse using this technique. Methods Three mature Thoroughbred geldings received 0.1?mg/kg bwt D5-phenylalanine (D5-Phe) i.v. and plasma D5-Phe enrichment was measured over 3?h. Pharmacokinetic modelling determined the rate of appearance and phenylalanine pool size, from which a loading dose and infusion rate that would achieve a steady 5?10% plasma enrichment were calculated. Subsequently, steady-state was confirmed by measuring plasma enrichment during 6?h of infusion and the effect of treadmill exercise and sedation (0.4?mg/kg bwt) were also determined. Horses subsequently received the calculated D5-Phe infusion rate and skeletal muscle biopsy samples were collected after 1 and 3?h, allowing basal MPS to be calculated. Precursor intramuscular phe labelling was measured by GC-MS and tracer phe incorporation into muscle myofibrillar protein was determined using GC-pyrolysis-IRMS to calculate fractional synthetic rate. Results The mean rate of whole body phenylalanine appearance in the horse was 56??mol/kg bwt/h (s.d. 24) and mean phenylalanine pool size 41??mol/kg bwt (s.d. 8.8). From this a priming dose of 3.3??mol/kg bwt and an infusion rate of 4.5??mol/kg bwt/h D5-Phenylalanine was calculated and subsequently confirmed to achieve steady state tracer enrichment from 5.6?9.1 APE in sedentary horses. Exercise caused a transitory, and sedation a more prolonged reduction in plasma enrichment (up to 20%). D5-Phe incorporation revealed a basal FSR of 0.029%/h (s.d. 0.013) in the horse. Conclusions D5-Phenylalanine is a suitable amino acid tracer for measurement of MPS in the horse yielding rates of MPS in line with other large mammals.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Interpretation of clinical diagnostic imaging of the equine musculoskeletal system requires accurate reference anatomical materials. In the case of MRI, this includes images acquired from low and high field systems. Using ultra-high field MRI, higher resolution images with small slice thickness and gap suitable for reconstruction in any anatomical plane can be produced. Objectives To describe the normal equine metacarpophalangeal joint using ultra-high field MRI and compare ultra-high and high field MR images. Study design Limbs (n?=?14) from horses (n?=?5) with no history of orthopaedic disease were frozen at -20°C until imaging. Fetlock joints were scanned using an ultra-high field (7T) MRI unit. T1 (280 slices, thickness?=?0.356?mm) and T2 (140 slices, thickness?=?0.713?mm) weighted sequences were acquired. Limbs were scanned using a 1.5T MRI unit in transverse, sagittal, and dorsal planes using T1 (60 slices, thickness 2.2?3.5?mm) and T2 (60 slices, thickness 2.2?3.5?mm) sequences. Images were analysed using OsiriX software. Results Ultra-high field MR images visualised the fine detail of trabecular and subchondral bone, the articular cartilage surface of P1 and McIII, the short, oblique, straight and oblique sesamoidean ligaments including origins and insertions, the fasicular structure of superficial digital flexor tendon, deep digital flexor tendon and ligaments and the regional neurovascular structures. Whilst T1 high field images visualised the majority of tissues, structural detail was reduced compared to ultra-high field imaging, margins were less well defined in some instances, e.g. articular cartilage, and a number of smaller structures were indistinct, e.g. short and cruciate sesamoidean ligaments. Conclusions 7T MRI produced images of the fetlock with excellent anatomical detail. Future publication of open-source ultra-high field MRI files could aid the interpretation of 0.3T and 1.5T field MR images, especially with the capacity to reconstruct image slices orientated exactly to match those of interest.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Insulin resistance (IR) can be difficult to diagnose from basal insulin and glucose concentrations, so a field-based oral sugar test (OST) is preferred. However, the repeatability of this test has not been reported. Objectives To determine the repeatability of an in-feed OST in ponies. Study design A repeated measures, longitudinal study. Methods Eight mixed-breed ponies received an in-feed OST at 08.00?h, after an overnight fast, once weekly for 3 weeks. D-glucose powder (0.75?g/kg bwt), wheat bran (200?g) and water (500?ml) were combined, and mixed with lucerne chaff (0.3% bwt). Blood samples were taken before, and 90 and 180?min after, feeding. All meals were consumed. Blood glucose concentration was determined immediately and serum was obtained for insulin determination by equine-specific ELISA. Fasting glucose, insulin and glucose:insulin ratios were used to classify ponies as IR, compensated IR or normal on each occasion and the results were compared to the OST. Results Diagnosis of IR from basal values was consistent in only 3/8 ponies, with a large mean coefficient of variation (CV) of 51% for baseline insulin, across tests. The OST results were repeatable in 7/8 ponies, with mean CV at 25% for the 90?min insulin sample (CV for 7 ponies: 19%). The OST was repeatable on 2/3 occasions in the eighth pony, however, resting hyperinsulinaemia meant that IR was diagnosed on 3/3 occasions using basal values in this pony. There was significant (P<0.05) variability in insulin concentration at 180?min, but not 90?min, across tests. Conclusions An OST is more repeatable when assessing IR in ponies than basal values/ratios. Both resting hyperinsulinaemia and insulin responses to oral sugar can be assessed with the OST, which increases the likelihood of accurately diagnosing IR. Blood sampling at 90?min post feeding is recommended for more consistent results.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Commingling of horses from various populations, together with stress associated with transport and confinement at a sales complex, may predispose horses to EHV-1 and -4 shedding and transmission. Current information on the prevalence and associated risk factors of EHV-1 and -4 in South Africa is limited. Relevant research could enhance scientific-based risk management strategies for horses attending sales events. Objectives Detect nasal shedding of EHV-1 and -4 at a sales event. Identify the temporal pattern of viral shedding. Investigate the association between clinical signs and EHV-1 and -4 shedding. Identify risk factors for EHV-1 and -4 shedding and transmission. Study design Prospective cohort study. Methods Data was collected over a 9 day period during August 2013 at the National Two Year Old Sales in Germiston, South Africa. The study population included 90 Thoroughbreds (51 colts, 39 fillies) in their second year of life that originated from 8 studs situated in 3 provinces. Nasal swabs were collected from each horse on arrival and on departure from the event. During their stay horses were monitored twice daily for pyrexia and once daily for nasal discharge. Nasal swabs were collected daily from any horse with nasal discharge and/or pyrexia. Nasal swabs were submitted for qPCR to detect EHV-1 and -4. Results No EHV-1 shedding was detected; however, 14.4% of the population shed EHV-4. A biphasic shedding pattern with peaks one day post arrival and on the first day of auction was observed. Pyrexia, with or without nasal discharge, was observed prior to first shedding in 61.5% of EHV-4-positive horses. Province, associated longer travel duration and smaller resident horse populations on farms of origin were associated with increased risk of EHV-4 shedding. Conclusions Young Thoroughbreds consigned to a South African sale shed EHV-4. Pyrexia proved useful to identify impending EHV-4 shedding.
