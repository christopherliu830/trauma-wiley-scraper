AB  - Reasons for performing study There are approximately 100 million working equids in developing countries worldwide. These animals? role in impoverished communities is generally unrecognised by national and international policy makers and their needs are overlooked in national animal health systems. Additionally, despite increased international development attention on women and livestock, the specific contributions of equids to poor womens? lives are also unquantified and overlooked. Objectives This study aimed to document the relationship between working equids and women in equine owning communities in Ethiopia, India, Kenya and Pakistan. Study design Qualitative semi-structured focus group discussions elicited opinions from small groups of women (up to 12/group) in selected rural and peri-urban areas in each country. Methods An experienced local language-speaking community facilitator guided each discussion using a standardised questionnaire based on UK Department for International Development sustainable livelihoods framework asset categories. Women's experiences of working equids? roles in their lives were audio-recorded, transcribed in local language and key themes summarised in English. Results Twenty-two discussions (7 in India, 5 each in Ethiopia, Kenya and Pakistan) comprising 259 women took place between February and October 2013. When asked to rank their livestock, all 12 groups in India and Kenya and 17 out of 22 groups overall ranked equids most important, due to their income generation and contribution to household chores, including transporting feedstuffs and water for other livestock species. Whilst specific responsibilities varied between communities, women reported undertaking many equine husbandry activities but lacked access to equine-specific knowledge and skills training. Conclusions The study findings can inform development of targeted training interventions for female working equid owners and users. Further work is required to quantify the contribution to livelihoods of working equids in developing countries to underpin engagement with government stakeholders on the benefit of providing for their needs in animal health and welfare systems.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There is limited information on tarsocrural arthroscopy for osteochondrosis dissecans lesions (OCD) in Great Britain, and routine examination of the plantar pouch has not been described. Objectives To describe clinical features of cases undergoing tarsocrural arthroscopy for OCD and estimate the prevalence of abnormalities within the plantar pouch. Study design Retrospective case review. Methods Case records of all horses that had tarsocrural arthroscopy for OCD at Rossdales Equine Hospital between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2013 were included (n?=?99). Descriptive data and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were constructed in Microsoft Excel. Results Warmbloods/Warmblood-crosses were significantly over-represented compared to the normal hospital population, comprising 42.4% (CI 32.7?52.2%) of the study (P<0.001), followed by Thoroughbreds/Thoroughbred-crosses (33.7%, CI 25.0?43.7%), 22 other horse breeds and one pony. Cases were predominantly male (70.7%, CI 63.6?81.3%) with 48.5% geldings, 19.2% colts and 3.0% stallions. Median age was 2.9 years (0.1?13.5 years) and median weight was 523?kg (112?919?kg). Most were nonracing sports horses (40.4%, CI 30.7?50.1%), or unbroken (27.0%, CI 18.5?36.0%) with the remainder used for breeding, general purpose or racing. Reasons for presentation were lameness (52.7%, CI 42.5?63.0%), effusion (36.3%, CI 26.4?46.1%), or survey radiographs (11.0%, CI 4.6?17.4%). Tarsocrural arthroscopy was most frequently performed bilaterally (41.8%, CI 32.1?51.6%), followed by left hind (35.7%, CI 26.2?45.2%), then right hind (22.4%, CI 14.2?30.7%). Irrespective of pathology in the dorsal pouch, examination of the plantar pouch was performed in 70 joints (50 horses), and in 78.0% (CI 66.5?89.5%) abnormalities were found. Of these, 10 required removal of organised fibrinous debris or osteochondral fragments (25.6% CI 11.9?39.3%), none of which were recorded using diagnostic imaging presurgery. Conclusions Investigation of the plantar pouch is indicated in routine tarsocrural arthroscopy for OCD as it often reveals additional pathology, which may necessitate surgical intervention. Further work will evaluate how plantar pouch pathology may influence prognosis. Ethical animal research:?Ethical approval obtained, project number AHT48-2013.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To compare an estimate of blood loss obtained using measurements from the Hemocue photometer with a standard estimate in dogs undergoing spinal surgery. Study design? Prospective clinical study. Animals? Twenty-nine client-owned dogs. Methods? During surgery, blood and all lavage fluids were collected in the suction container and on to swabs. To prevent blood clot formation in the suction container, 10?mL citrate-phosphate dextrose adenine (CPDA) was added. At the end of the procedure, the total volume in the suction container was recorded. It was shaken to ensure uniformity and a 5 mL sample tested with the HemoCue photometer. Blood loss in the suction container was calculated as follows: Blood in suction (mL)?=?volume in bottle (mL)???[suction haemoglobin (Hb) concentration (g?dL?1)/pre-operative Hb concentration (g dL?1)]. This volume was added to the estimated volume of blood on the swabs (weight of soaked swabs minus that of dry swabs) to provide the Hemocue estimate of total blood loss. A standard haemorrhage estimate was performed using the volume of fluid in the suction container at the end of surgery in excess of the total volume of lavage fluid available, minus 10?mL CPDA. This volume was added to the estimated volume of blood on the swabs to provide the standard estimate of total blood loss. Data were analyzed with a paired t-test. Retrospective power calculations demonstrated an 80% power to detect a mean difference of 25?mL between the two methods with a level of significance of 0.05. Results? There was no significant difference in calculated blood loss between the two methods (p?=?0.8, mean difference: ?2?mL, 95% CI: ?20 to 16?mL). Conclusions and clinical relevance? The HemoCue may be used to help estimate blood loss in dogs undergoing spinal surgery.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There have been no detailed descriptions of the radiological appearance of the centrodistal joint interosseous ligament in horses with and without distal hock joint pain. Objectives 1) To describe the normal radiological appearance of the region of the centrodistal joint interosseous ligament; 2) to determine the frequency of occurrence of mineralisation or ossification of the interosseous ligament and to describe radiological abnormalities surrounding the interosseous space; 3) to describe concurrent radiological abnormalities in the tarsus. It was hypothesised that ossification of the interosseous ligament will be associated with radiological evidence of osteoarthritis of the centrodistal joint. Study design Systematic radiological analysis using a predefined grading system, after a repeatability study, and descriptive statistics. Methods Case records and radiographs of all horses which underwent radiographic examination of one or both tarsi over 7 years were reviewed. Results There were 700 horses, including 470 examined bilaterally. The normal interosseous space was an oval-shaped radiolucent area surrounded by subchondral bone of uniform opacity and thickness. Changes in the region of the interosseous ligament of the centrodistal joint were evident in 190/1170 (16.2%) tarsi, including 50 horses examined bilaterally. In 33/190 (17.4%) tarsi there was complete loss of the oval-shaped radiolucent area, together with increased thickness of the adjacent subchondral bone, endosteal irregularity and increased opacity of the adjacent trabecular bone. In addition 157/190 tarsi had patchy increased opacity within the interosseous space and alterations of the adjacent subchondral and trabecular bone. There was radiological evidence of osteoarthritis of the centrodistal joint in 27/33 (81.8%) of tarsi with complete ossification of the centrodistal interosseous ligament, 17 of which (51.5%) had distal tarsal pain, and in 29/157 (18.5%) tarsi with other abnormalities of the centrodistal interosseous ligament. Conclusions When evaluating the tarsus radiologically the region of the centrodistal joint interosseous ligament should be assessed.

AB  - Reasons for performing study There are no reports of proximal suspensory desmopathy (PSD) and concurrent injuries of the proximal aspect of the accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon (ALDDFT). Objectives To describe clinical features, response to local analgesia and ultrasonographic features. Study design Retrospective study. Methods Review of case records, January 2009?2014. Results There were 8 horses with forelimb lameness, 4 unilateral and 4 bilateral (2 with bilateral injuries of the suspensory ligament [SL] and ALDDFT and 2 with PSD and injury of the ALDDFT in one limb and injury of the ALDDFT alone in the other). One horse had pain on palpation of the proximal aspect of the ALDDFT. Lameness was abolished by palmar metacarpal (subcarpal) nerve blocks in 10/12 limbs; in 2 limbs an ulnar nerve block was required to abolish lameness. There were 5 horses with bilateral hindlimb lameness; concurrent desmopathy of the ALDDFT and PSD was identified in one horse. In the other 4 horses there was a history of bilateral PSD which had undergone treatment. Recurrent lameness was associated with unilateral (n?=?3) or bilateral (n?=?1) PSD and desmopathy of the ALDDFT. In 2 horses there was soft tissue swelling in the proximomedial aspect of the metatarsus in the region of the ALDDFT. Lameness was abolished by local infiltration of mepivacaine in the proximoplantar aspect of the metatarsus in 3 limbs; in one limb a tibial nerve block was required to eliminate lameness. In all horses lesions were characterised ultrasonographically by enlargement of both the ALDDFT and the proximal aspect of the SL and a diffuse decrease in echogenicity. There was echogenic material between the SL and ALDDFT in 5 limbs. Conclusions All soft tissue structures in the proximal aspect of the metacarpus/metatarsus should be evaluated ultrasonographically if pain is localised to this area.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Clinical differences and variable response to therapy had been suspected between sport horses with predominantly eosinophils and/or mast cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and horses with predominantly neutrophilia in the BALF. Objectives To examine possible differences in performance, response to treatment and prognosis between both groups. Study design Retrospective clinical study. Methods A total of 174 client-owned sport horses that were presented to the Wolvega Equine Clinic for respiratory problems between 2008 and 2013 were included. A questionnaire was used for follow-up at least 3 months after diagnosis. Cytological BALF counts were considered increased when: neutrophils >5%; eosinophils >1% and mast cells >2%. Data were analysed using SPSS software and Chi square tests. Results Cough and highest mucus scores were significantly more associated with neutrophilic IAD (P?=?0.009 and P?=?0.007). The neutrophilia group was also significantly more responsive to therapy, often including corticosteroid inhalation, and management optimisation (P?=?0.001) and had better long-term prognosis when compared to horses from the eosinophilic or mast cell groups (P<0.001). Lowest tracheal mucus scores were reported for the eosinophilic group, followed by the mast cell group. Haemosiderophage scores were significantly higher in the eosinophilic and mast cell groups (P<0.001). Poor performance was reported significantly more frequently in horses with eosinophils and mast cells as the main inflammatory cell population in their BALF (P?=?0.001). Conclusions Inflammatory airway disease with predominantly mast cells or eosinophils is associated with low endoscopic tracheal mucus scores. These horses are more predisposed to EIPH, poor performance and responded unfavourably to therapy when compared to horses with neutrophilic IAD.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Adipose tissue deposited along the crest of the neck has been associated with altered metabolic states and with an increased risk of laminitis in equids. Thickness of the neck is a phenotipic characteristic in Andalusians; however, there are no studies evaluating this condition in this breed. Objectives To evaluate morphometric and ultrasonographic measurements in the neck area for assessment of neck adiposity and its associations with adiposity scores and biochemical variables. Study design A sample of 115 Andalusian horses (46 barren mares and 69 stallions, 2?15 years old) was evaluated in a cross-sectional study. Methods Cresty neck score (CNS) was determined. Two groups were created: cresty neck (CNS?≥?3) and noncresty neck (CNS<3) horses. Neck circumference (NC) (cm) and ultrasonography (US) of subcutaneous fat (mm) at 25% (NC0.25?US0.25), 50% (NC0.50?US0.50) and 75% (NC0.75?US0.75) of neck length were measured. Middle neck circumference (NC), neck length and height at the withers were taken to calculate neck ratios (NC0.50:height, NC0.50:neck length). Plasma was analysed for insulin and leptin. Hyperinsulinemia was defined as insulin ≥20??iu/ml. Correlations using Pearson and Spearman coefficients were evaluated. Mean comparisons were carried out with Student's t or Mann-Whitney tests. Results Cresty neck condition was present in 73.9% (n?=?85) of the horses and 2.6% (n?=?3) were hyperinsulinaemic. Cresty neck horses had significantly higher plasma leptin, morphometric and ultrasonographic measurements. NC0.50:height was the most correlated parameter with CNS. Insulin was correlated with leptin levels and all morphometric measurements. Insulin and leptin were correlated only with US0.75. Conclusions Andalusian horses? neck score, despite their thick necks in the majority of individuals, does not have a good correlation with plasma insulin and leptin levels. Since in Andalusian horses, neck scores may be overestimating obesity, further studies on ultrasonographic fat measurements are needed. Ethical animal research:?The university committee for the ethical use of animals approved all procedures. Owners gave informed consent for their horses? inclusion in the study.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Advanced imaging modalities enable assessment of the equine skull and brain. Horses are susceptible to neurological dysfunction of the cranial nerves; however, our understanding of these structures? imaging anatomy is limited. Hypothesis Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be superior to computed tomography (CT) for the identification of cranial nerves, but optimal assessment may depend on both modalities. Objectives Identify cranial nerves and compare and contrast the utility of MRI and CT images of cadaver and clinical material. Interpret images from both modalities and determine the cranial nerve imaging anatomy. Study design Prospective cadaver anatomical study combined with retrospective clinical case study. Methods The head of a neurologically normal 9-year-old Thoroughbred gelding was scanned immediately following euthanasia (performed for reasons unrelated to this study). High resolution MRI (1.5 Tesla) and CT examinations were conducted over a 12?h interval following euthanasia. Images obtained were compared with selected clinical cases which were scanned during anaesthesia (MRI; approximately 30?60?min) or standing sedation (CT; approximately 30?s). Results On a high resolution MRI scan of a cadaver equine skull, each of the 12 cranial nerves and their topographic location was readily appreciated. Cranial nerves 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8 were more easily identified in clinically relevant MRI scans. CT allowed visualisation of the stylomastoid foramen, the inner and middle ear and cranial nerves 2, 3, 5 and 7. Conclusions High field MRI allows for excellent visualisation of equine cranial nerves. CT allows for detailed visualisation of the osseous canals and foramina. This study advances anatomical knowledge of the normal equine cranial nerves to aid interpretation in horses that display neurological dysfunction localising to the brain and brainstem.

AB  - Reasons for performing study To determine the prevalence of EHV-1, -2, -4 and -5 in respiratory samples from a large number of horses using quantitative PCR methods. Samples from horses with, and without mild signs of respiratory disease provided an opportunity to examine associations with single or multiple herpesviral infections. Objectives To determine any correlation between quantitative detection of these equine herpesviruses and mild clinical respiratory disease in horses. Methods Nasal swabs were taken from horses with, and without, clinical respiratory disease. Nucleic acid was extracted from all swabs prior to PCR testing for EHV-1, -2, -4 and -5. Clinical signs of respiratory disease included coughing, fever (temperature >38.5°C) or nasal discharge. Results Of the 409 horses, 250 (61%) were clinically normal, 121 (30%) presented with clinical signs consistent with mild respiratory disease and 38 (9%) horses had no traceable clinical history. One-fifth (83/409) of horses sampled were infected with EHV-2 and almost two-thirds 249/409 (60.9%) with EHV-5. Infection with EHV-5 was significantly associated with mild respiratory disease (85/121; 70.2%) compared to nondiseased horses (137/249; 55%) P?=?0.005. The proportion of EHV-2 infected horses, however, did not differ significantly between those in the diseased (18/121) and nondiseased (61/250) groups. Too few horses were detected with alphaherpesviruses to determine any association with clinical signs of disease. Mean nasal shedding loads of herpesviruses were not significantly different between diseased and nondiseased horses. Conclusions There was a significant association between horses displaying clinical signs of mild respiratory disease and infection with EHV-5, however, no such association was evident for neither horses with EHV-2 nor the alphaherpesviruses EHV-1 and -4. The clinical significance of respiratory gammaherpesvirus infections in horses remains yet to be determined; however, these findings add to the mounting body of evidence incriminating EHV-5 in association with equine respiratory disease.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Despite ongoing advances in diagnostic imaging, ?wind-testing? remains the most common screening test for upper respiratory tract obstructions and is an important condition of sale at Thoroughbred public auctions in UK/Europe. Correlations between abnormal respiratory noise and resting laryngeal function have been incompletely investigated to date. Objectives To determine whether associations exist between respiratory noise at lunge and subsequent diagnosis of recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN). Study design Retrospective analysis of records for all post sale wind-testing undertaken by a single veterinary practice at Tattersalls Newmarket yearling, breeze-up and horse-in-training sales between 2009 and 2013. Methods Descriptions of abnormal respiratory noise were categorised as ?inspiratory whistle?, ?inspiratory harsh? or ?pan-respiratory harsh?, and included lunge direction during which noise was evident. Concurrent examination by 2 veterinary surgeons was a criterion for inclusion of cases. All horses making abnormal respiratory noises underwent resting endoscopy with a consensus score (Lane scale) given for laryngeal function. Results 2972 horses underwent post sale wind-testing and 418 horses (14.1%) underwent resting endoscopic examination due to abnormal respiratory noise. Likelihood of making an abnormal respiratory noise differed significantly between groups (yearlings 10.8%, ?breeze-up? 2-year-olds 20.6%, horses-in-training 30.1%). Yearlings were significantly more likely (P<0.0001, Chi-squared/Bonferroni test) to make a ?harsh? respiratory noise than horses-in-training. Type of noise (whistle) was significantly associated with resting endoscopic evidence of RLN in yearlings (P?=?0.009); specificity of ?whistle? for RLN in this group was 38.6%. There was no association between lunge direction noise (left, right or both) and RLN. Conclusions These results support the widespread belief that harsh respiratory noise when lunged of presumed ?palatal/pharyngeal? origin is more likely in yearlings than horses-in-training, possibly due to upper respiratory inflammation or immaturity. Inspiratory whistle in both lunge directions is no stronger an indicator of RLN than unidirectional whistle.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The relationships between hind foot conformation, placement and motion symmetry in the equine hindlimb are poorly defined. Little research has been carried out into the potential interactions between these variables despite the commonality of hindlimb lameness in sports and leisure horses. Objectives To determine hind foot placement and describe the relationships between hind foot conformation, placement and motion symmetry. Study design Observational study. Methods Overall foot placement of 43 horses was determined from simultaneous orthogonal filming at walk and trot, foot conformation was measured from digital photographs and motion symmetry data was collected using horse mounted inertial sensors. Results Left and right hind foot conformation differed significantly (P?=?0.001?0.036). Foot placement was not significantly different between left and right feet, despite these conformational differences. Foot placement was significantly different between walk and trot (P<0.001). Lateral heel landing was the most common landing pattern observed at walk (55.81%) and trot (43.12%). Lateral and lateral toe landings were more common at trot, though relatively uncommon at both gaits. Foot conformation was significantly associated with motion symmetry (P<0.001?0.007) and with placement at trot (P?=?0.002?0.005) but not walk. Conclusions Hind feet land preferentially laterally and heel first at both the walk and trot. Foot conformation appeared to be associated with landing patterns at the trot but not walk. Foot conformation was also associated with motion symmetry, although it is difficult to say whether conformation affects symmetry or vice versa. Multiple factors contribute to equine locomotion, foot conformation, landing patterns and the maintenance of orthopaedic health.

AB  - Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics, management and long-term outcome in dogs with suspected rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. Method: Medical records and video recordings of 14 dogs with suspected rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder were reviewed and the owners were contacted via telephone or email for further information. Results: Clinical signs included episodes of violent limb movements, howling, barking, growling, chewing, or biting during sleep. Episodes occurred at night and during daytime naps. The age at onset ranged from 8 weeks to 7·5 years with a median of 6 years but 64% of dogs were one year or less. There was no apparent sex or breed predisposition. Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder events were reduced in severity and frequency in 78% of the dogs treated with 40 mg/kg/day oral potassium bromide. One dog was euthanised within 3 months of the onset of signs because of their severity. The duration of the disorder in the 13 surviving dogs ranged from 1·5 to 9 years. None of the dogs spontaneously recovered. Clinical Significance: Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder is suspected to occur in dogs, as it does in human beings. It causes concern to the owners and disrupts the home environment. Unlike human beings, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder of dogs often has a juvenile onset.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Combinations of α2-adrenoceptor and opioid agonists are commonly used in equines, but there is little scientific information on this topic in donkeys. Objectives To compare the sedative and hypoalgesic effects of 4 dosages of butorphanol in xylazine-premedicated donkeys. Study design In vivo experiment. Methods Six donkeys received intravenous treatments: saline and saline (S-S); xylazine (0.5?mg/kg bwt) and saline (X-S); xylazine and butorphanol 10??g/kg bwt (X-B10); xylazine and butorphanol 20??g/kg bwt (X-B20); xylazine and butorphanol 30??g/kg bwt (X-B30); and xylazine and butorphanol 40??g/kg bwt (X-B40). Sedation score (0?3), head height above ground (HHAG), and mechanical nociceptive thresholds (MNT) of the left metacarpus were assessed before and for 120?min after treatment. Areas under the curve (AUC) for 0?30, 30?60 and 60?120?min post treatment were computed for sedation scores (SS-AUC), HHAG (HHAG-AUC) and MNT (MNT-AUC). Differences between treatments were analysed using the Friedman test followed by Dunn's test and repeated measures one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test. Results All treatments except S-S induced sedation. Butorphanol treatments induced significantly greater SS-AUC0?30 values than those for S-S (P<0.05), but S-S and X-S SS-AUC0?30 values were not significantly different. The HHAG-AUC0?30 values for all treatments were smaller than corresponding values for S-S (P<0.001). For HHAG-AUC30-60, only X-B40 values were significantly smaller than corresponding values for S-S (P<0.05). Compared to S-S, all treatments increased MNT and yielded significantly higher MNT-AUC0?30 values (P<0.001). Treatment X-S yielded significantly lower MNT-AUC0?30 values than those for X-B30 and X-B40 (P<0.05). Only MNT-AUC30?60 values for X-B30 and X-B40 were higher than those for S-S and X-S (P<0.05). Conclusions Xylazine induced sedation and mechanical hypoalgesia that were enhanced by adding butorphanol at 40??g/kg bwt. This drug combination may be suitable for chemical restraint of donkeys undergoing clinical procedures. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Sources of funding:?Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine intramural grant. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Equine cervical osteoarthritis is a common disease known to contribute to both neck pain and cervical vertebral compressive myelopathy. There are no published studies demonstrating the usefulness of latero-oblique radiography as a diagnostic tool for cervical osteoarthritis. Objectives To determine the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of latero-oblique radiography as a diagnostic tool for cervical articular process joint osteoarthritis. Study design Prospective cadaver study. Methods Latero-oblique radiographs and CT images were collected, and post mortem examinations performed, on 27 cadaver necks from Thoroughbred-type horses of various ages and sexes. Two equine clinicians independently reviewed each set of images for the presence of osteoarthritis. The authors, under the guidance of a veterinary pathologist, reviewed all articular process joints for bony changes indicative of osteoarthritis. Results The prevalence of osteoarthritis identified on CT images was 57.9% (Assessor A) and 23% (Assessor B). The prevalence of lesions identified on post mortem examination was 25.6%. Latero-oblique radiography showed a low sensitivity for identifying osteoarthritis when compared to both CT imaging (6.3?16.1%) and post mortem examination (2.2?4.4%). However, it showed a high specificity when compared to both CT imaging (92.1?97.8%) and post mortem examination (87.2?95.0%). The positive predictive value for identifying osteoarthritis was moderate (40.9?80.0%) when compared to CT imaging and poor (4.2?18.2%) when compared to post mortem examination. The negative predictive value was moderate when compared to both CT imaging (42.9?76.3%) and post mortem examination (78.0?79.8%). Conclusions Latero-oblique radiography has low sensitivity, but high specificity for the detection of cervical osteoarthritis when compared to both CT imaging and post mortem examination. Further investigation comparing the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of latero-oblique radiography vs. laterolateral radiography would determine whether taking latero-oblique radiographs, which can be more difficult to obtain and interpret, is necessary for the diagnosis of cervical osteoarthritis in practice.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Cervical spine lesions are often suspected in horses with neurological signs, abnormal head/neck position and obscure forelimb lameness. Computed tomography (CT) has the potential to image the cervical spine in 3 dimensions in superior anatomical detail; e.g. lesions that cause compression of the spinal cord and nerve roots, small fragments, and osteoarthritis of the articular process joints may be more easily detected. Objectives To investigate if CT and CT myelography of the entire cervical spine is possible in horses, describe the technique used, the type of horses and distribution of cervical lesions detected. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Horses undergoing cervical CT and CT myelography from June 2013 to February 2014 were reviewed. The horses were anaesthetised in left lateral recumbency using continuous intravenous anaesthesia. A Philips Brilliance Big Bore 16 slice scanner and a custom made equine CT table (Solving, Finland) were used. Results Cervical CT was performed on 16 horses, 11 of which also had CT myelography: 12 Warmblood, 2 ponies, 1 Standardbred and 1 Paint Horse. Horses ranged in age from 1 to 21 years, and in weight from 406 to 670?kg. Presenting complaints were: neurological symptoms (n?=?8), abnormal head/neck position (n?=?5), forelimb lameness (n?=?4), Horners syndrome (n?=?1). In all cases (n?=?16) the cervical spine from the skull to C7 could be imaged, in 3 cases T1 was imaged and in one case T3. Significant lesions were detected in 14 horses. The sites of the most significant lesions were: C4?C5 (n?=?3), C5?C6 (n?=?2), C6?C7 (n?=?5) and C7?T1 (n?=?2), cervical stenosis C5?T2 (n?=?1) and muscle injury (n?=?1). Length of anaesthesia ranged from 35 to 70?min (median 60?min), with one complicated recovery. Conclusions Cervical CT and CT myelography can be performed in large adult horses. CT may be the future gold standard to evaluate equine cervical lesions. Further studies are needed.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Recommendations for prophylactic vaccination against tetanus in horses vary greatly between countries and have scarce scientific support in the peer-reviewed literature. In human medicine, recommended booster vaccination intervals are also very variable, but are considerably longer than for horses. Objectives To investigate if the duration of antibody titres previously determined to be protective against tetanus are likely to be longer than indicated by several recommended vaccination intervals for horses. Study design Prospective clinical trial. Methods Thirty-four horses were enrolled for basic immunisation with an ISCOM Matrix-combination vaccine (Equilis? Prequenza TE). Horses received the first vaccination at 5?11 months of age, and the second dose 4 weeks later. A third vaccine dose was given 15?17 months after the second dose. Serum tetanus antibody titres were analysed by ToBi ELISA 2 weeks as well as 14?16 months after the second dose. After the third vaccine dose, titres were checked once yearly for 3 years. Results Two weeks after the second dose all horses (34/34) had antibody levels that exceeded 0.03?iu/ml. After 16 months the levels were below 0.03?iu/ml in 5/33 horses. After the third vaccine dose antibody levels remained above 0.03?iu/ml in 25/26 horses for 1 year, 17/17 horses for 2 years, and 9/9 horses for 3 years. Conclusions Horses that undergo basic immunisation with 3 doses of vaccine after the age of 6 months are likely to have serum antibody titres consistent with protection against tetanus for more than 3 years.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Embryo transfer (ET) is an increasingly common component of commercial sport-horse breeding. While many variables affect the success of ET, optimal selection of recipient mares is essential. Ideally, adequate corpus luteum (CL) function would be evaluated by measuring plasma progesterone (P4) concentrations (≥2.0?ng/ml). In practice however, P4 is rarely measured because it would increase costs, and there is a delay to obtaining a result. Colour-flow Doppler sonography (CF) has been described as a rapid means of assessing CL function because luteal blood flow correlates with circulating P4 concentrations. Objectives To use CF to assess luteal blood flow at the time of ET in recipient mares, and assess its relationship to P4 concentrations and pregnancy outcome. Study design Cohort study. Methods Fifty-eight Day 8 horse embryos were transferred as part of a commercial programme. B-mode and CF sonographic examinations were performed immediately prior to ET (ET+0), and blood was collected to measure plasma P4. Measurements were repeated at 4, 11, 18 and 25 days after ET in pregnant mares. Mares scanned not pregnant at Day 4 were re-checked 2 days later. The CF image of each CL was frozen at peak total area of flow, and repeated 3 times. The cross-sectional area (corrected for presence of lacunae) and the total area of colour pixels within the CL were analysed using ImageJ software. Results Plasma P4 correlated positively (P<0.05) with area of colour pixels (range r?=?0.40?0.55) and total CL area (range r?=?0.41?0.51) at all time-points. None of plasma P4, CL area, or CF pixel area were predictive of pregnancy outcome. Conclusions CL blood flow is not predictive of pregnancy outcome but should help identify mares with an inadequate CL and not therefore suitable for receiving an embryo.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Horseshoe studs are commonly used to increase traction between the foot and the ground in competition horses. Here we investigate the question of how hindlimb studs alter limb function by quantifying upper body kinematics during circular motion (lungeing). Objectives This study quantified the effects of studs placed in the hind shoes on head and pelvic movement symmetry parameters commonly used for objective assessment of lameness. Study design Prospective longitudinal interventional study. Methods 15 horses were trotted on the straight and lunged on left and right circles on turf with/without a pair of studs in both hind shoes. Movement symmetry was assessed using inertial sensors mounted on poll, os sacrum and left and right tuber coxae. To eliminate the influence of the number of left/right asymmetrical horses in the sample, symmetry values were standardised to show left fore and/or right hind asymmetry on the straight. Differences in standardised head and pelvic symmetry index (SI) with and without studs were calculated and paired t tests were used to compare SI values with and without studs on the straight and on both reins. Results Use of studs resulted in a significant difference (P?=?0.02) in pelvic SI on the right lunge only but no difference for straight line and left lunge (both P>0.05). No significant difference was found for head movement symmetry (all P>0.05). Conclusions Pelvic movement was altered with the ?weaker? right hindlimb (based on the calculation of standardised SI values) on the inside of the circle creating an increased ?hip hike?. In general, horses show increased limb angles and lower peak vertical force with the inside limb; our kinematic results show that this effect is exacerbated with studs. Future studies should investigate whether this ?intervention? is of diagnostic potential in sub-clinically hindlimb lame horses.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Anthelmintic resistance is a global problem and constitutes a major threat to the welfare of equids worldwide. The cyathostomins are the most numerous and pathogenic gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) of equids in the developed world. Cyathostomins show widespread resistance to 2 out of 3 of the major classes of anthelmintic and recently there are reports of reduced efficacy to the potent macrocyclic lactones (MLs). None of the 3 novel classes of anthelmintic that have emerged in the last decade are licensed for use in equids. The cysteine proteases (CPs) are plant proteins that have shown potent activity against GINs?in vivo in sheep and pigs. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the anthelmintic effect of the CP papain on cyathostomins in vitro using the egg hatch assay (EHA) and larval migration inhibition test (LMIT). Methods Samples of cyathostomin eggs and third stage larvae were collected and cultured from a population of equids that have recently shown reduced ML efficacy in vivo. The EHA and LMIT were performed on repeated samples with increasing concentrations of papain. Dose?response curves were plotted and PROBIT analysis performed on the data to give EC-50 values (concentration that gives 50% of the maximal response). Results Papain caused a dose dependent inhibition of both egg hatch and larval migration. The EC-50 values were 2??mol/l and 100??mol/l in the EHA and LMIT respectively, indicating a more potent effect on egg hatch. Conclusions The CP papain shows potent anthelmintic activity against cyathostomins in vitro. Good evidence of anthelmintic effect against GINs in other host species is supportive of its potential use in equids. Further work is indicated to evaluate safety and in vivo efficacy.
