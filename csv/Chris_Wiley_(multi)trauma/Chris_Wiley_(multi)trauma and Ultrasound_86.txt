AB  - Reasons for performing study Little exists in the literature regarding the outcome of endoscopically-guided desmotomy of the palmar/plantar annular ligament (PAL) where injury to the PAL was the only diagnosis. Objectives To report the return to previous level of exercise in horses treated with endoscopically guided PAL resection in which PAL injury was considered to be the primary condition. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Medical records of surgical cases at Donnington Grove Veterinary Surgery between 2005 and 2013 were reviewed. The inclusion criteria were cases that had undergone surgical transection of the palmar/plantar annular ligament under general anaesthesia and endoscopic guidance using a No. 12 scalpel blade where annular ligament injury was the only notable finding at surgery. Follow-up was obtained by a telephone questionnaire. Results Twenty-three horses were included in the study. Twenty horses were noted to have restriction to passage of the arthroscope within the digital flexor tendon sheath at the time of surgery. Following the initial 3-month post operative rest period 21 horses were sound. Three horses did not return to their previous level of activity due to unrelated lameness issues and 2 returned to a lower level of competition due to owner preference. Of the remaining 18 horses, 16 returned to their previous level of athletic performance. Two horses had recurrent or persistent lameness associated with the residual PAL desmopathy. Conclusions In this case series surgical treatment of primary PAL injury carries a good prognosis (89% return to previous level of exercise) in contrast to a previously reported study (<50% of horses were able to return to athletic function) [1].

AB  - Abstract Esthetic considerations are a significant contributing factor in the management of prosthodontic cases and an interdisciplinary approach is often necessary to achieve an optimal result. The visible soft-tissue architecture plays a key role in developing an esthetic smile. Furthermore, an understanding of the relationship between the restorative margin and the gingiva is important for long-term stability of the result. The gingival architecture and gingival health are important for ensuring optimal esthetics following prosthodontic work and close attention to both soft and hard tissues around the teeth, before, during and after restorative procedures, will greatly improve the likelihood of a successful outcome. Moreover, knowing the options available in periodontal plastic surgery is important in esthetic dentistry today. The relevant literature related to restorative and surgical procedures when performing esthetic dentistry are reviewed in this article, and different approaches are illustrated with appropriate cases to explain the treatment approach that was utilized to improve the esthetic appearance of the case.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the fresh gas flow (FGF) rate requirements for the Humphrey ADE semi-closed breathing system in the Mapleson A mode; to determine the FGF at which rebreathing occurs, and compare the efficiency of this system to the Bain (Mapleson D) system in spontaneously breathing cats and small dogs. Study Design Prospective clinical study. Animals Twenty-five healthy (ASA score I or II) client-owned cats and dogs (mean ± SD age 4.7 ± 5.0 years, and body weight 5.64 ± 3.26 kg) undergoing elective surgery or minor procedures. Methods Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane delivered via the Humphrey ADE system in the A mode using an oxygen FGF of 100 mL kg?1 minute?1. The FGF was then reduced incrementally by 5?10 mL kg?1minute?1 at approximately five-minute intervals, until rebreathing (inspired CO2 >5 mmHg (0.7 kPa)) was observed, after which flow rates were increased. In six animals, once the minimum FGF at which rebreathing occurred was found, the breathing system was changed to the Bain, and the effects of this FGF delivery examined, before FGF was increased. Results Rebreathing did not occur at the FGF recommended by the manufacturer for the ADE. The mean ± SD FGF that resulted in rebreathing was 60 ± 20 mL kg?1minute?1. The mean minimum FGF at which rebreathing did not occur with the ADE was 87 ± 39 mL kg?1minute?1. This FGF resulted in significant rebreathing (inspired CO2 8.8 ± 2.6 mmHg (1.2 ± 0.3 kPa)) on the Bain system. Conclusions The FGF rates recommended for the Humphrey ADE are adequate to prevent rebreathing in spontaneously breathing cats and dogs <15 kg. Clinical relevance The Humphrey ADE system used in the A mode is a more efficient alternative to the Bain system, for maintenance of gaseous anaesthesia in spontaneously breathing cats and small dogs.

AB  - Abstract Purpose The aim of this article was to analyze the horizontal, vertical, and histological effects of alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) versus the ones of unassisted socket healing, in the format of an up-to-date review and meta-analysis. Materials and Methods An extensive electronic search in the electronic databases of the National Library of Medicine was conducted for articles published up to June 2014 to identify literature presenting data on the topic of ARP. Only randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, and prospective trials were included for meta-analysis. Results After screening 903 abstracts from the electronic database, we included 64 studies in qualitative and 18 in quantitative synthesis. Quality assessment characterized a medium risk of bias for the included literature. The meta-analysis showed a mean difference between test and control groups of approximately 1.31 to 1.54?mm in bucco-oral bone width and 0.91 to 1.12?mm in bone height. Additionally, the intergroup difference in percentage of vital bone was assessed to be inconclusive across the included studies. Implants could be inserted into the determined position without further augmentation in 90.1% of the experimental sites, while this was the case in only 79.2% of the control sockets. Conclusions Resorption of the alveolar ridge cannot be totally stopped by ARP, while it still can be prevented compared with unassisted healing. No reliable predictions on the histological effects could be made due to limited data. Further on, no recommendation for a specific technique of ARP could be made. In conclusion, there is still need for ongoing research on the topic, even though the lower percentage of implant sites that needed additional augmentation in test sockets seemed to bring a patient benefit.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Tumours of the thyroid gland are rare in the equine species. In literature varying clinical signs and diagnostic findings are described in single reports and case series. Reported clinical signs are related to upper airway compression or thyroidal metabolic activity. A considerable risk of laryngeal hemiplegia is described when horses were treated with hemithyroidectomy [1]. Objectives To review 11 horses referred with a unilateral thyroid neoplasia in order to describe clinical presentation, diagnostic findings, treatment and outcome. Histopathology was performed on all resected thyroid lobes. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Records from horses with histologically confirmed thyroid tumours treated with unilateral thyroid lobe resection were reviewed (2003?2013). Short-term outcome was defined for 2 weeks after surgery. Owners? questionnaire was performed for evaluation of long-term outcome defined as a minimum of 6 months. Results Affected horses were aged between 6 and 21 years. In contrast to literature the majority of tumours were adenocarcinomas (9/11), mainly found in mares (8/9). Histology revealed follicular and parafollicular (C-cell) mixed growth pattern of the carcinomas. Tumour size, growth rate and sonographic appearance did not correlate to histological characteristics. Ventral displacement of the thyroid lobe and close preparation along the thyroid capsule during surgical resection are inevitable to avoid damage to laryngeal nerves. Seroma formation was the only observed short-term complication. No long-term complications occurred. Conclusions Hemithyroidectomy is regarded the treatment of choice in horses with a unilateral thyroid lobe neoplasia with excellent long-term prognosis. High incidence of malignant tumours particularly in mares has to be considered. Tumour characteristics can only be derived from histopathology and immunhistochemistry.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Lack of ?gold standard? for pain assessment in horses. Objectives To assess different approaches of quantifying pain in horses. Castration was chosen as a pain model because of its wide clinical relevance. Study design Exploratory study. Methods 51 equine stallions undergoing castration under general anaesthesia were divided in 3 pain-relieving treatment groups: A) single perioperative administration of flunixin (n?=?19), B) additional subsequent flunixin administrations (n?=?21), D) like A but with intra-operative mepivacaine injections into the spermatic cord (n?=?11). All horses were assessed before and 5 times after surgery (up to 44?h) by means of a modified composite pain scale (CPS), a newly developed facial expression pain scale (FEPS), faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (GCMs) and plasma cytokine profiles. The same parameters were measured in a control group C, undergoing general anaesthesia for different nonpainful procedures (n?=?6). Data were analysed with nonparametric statistical tests (Wilcoxon, Mann Whitney U). Results Time had an influence on CPS and FEPS scores in treatment groups A, B and D but not in C. Scores of groups A and B were higher compared to groups D and C at 4 (CPS, FEPS) and 8?h (CPS), whereas there was no difference between groups A and B nor between groups D and C. Only in group AB was there an increase of faecal GCMs 20?h after surgery. GCMs in group AB were higher compared with groups C and D at 32?h. No effects by time or treatment could be identified for the different plasma cytokines. Conclusions CPS and FEPS seem to be able to detect different levels of post castration pain differentiating from possible anaesthesia effect. Additional local anaesthesia of the spermatic cord was associated with lower post surgical pain scores when compared to perioperative flunixin application alone, whereas subsequent applications of flunixin had no obvious effect.

AB  - Reasons for performing the study Equine sarcoids are locally aggressive fibroblastic cutaneous tumours, representing the third most common health problem in working horses. In developed countries they also have welfare and economic impact (e.g. prepurchase examination). No current treatment offers 100% success rate. It is now well established that Bovine Papillomavirus (BPV) types 1 and 2 play an important role in the pathogenesis of sarcoid tumours. In a number of human cancers, aberrant expression of microRNAs has been linked to the cancerous phenotype. microRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that regulate essential biological and cellular processes. Currently there is much interest in their role as biomarkers and potential therapeutic agents for many diseases. Objectives In an attempt to improve our understanding of the pathobiology of sarcoids, we aim to identify specific microRNAs associated with equine sarcoids. Study design Differential expression of microRNAs was assessed in control equine fibroblasts (EqPalfs) and EqPalfs transformed with the BPV-1 genome (S6-2s). Methods Using a commercially available human microarray, 453 microRNAs were interrogated in RNA samples from both cell lines. Each cell line was analysed in triplicate. Results 219 individual microRNAs were differentially expressed in control (EqPalFs) versus BPV-transformed cells (S6-2s) (P<0.05). of these, 148 microRNAs (68%) were underexpressed in S6-2 cells relative to EqPalfs. Conclusions We have shown that BPV-1 transformed equine cell lines exhibit a different microRNA profile to control equine fibroblasts and the aberrant expression of microRNAs in S6-2 cells can be attributed to the presence of BPV-1 genomes. Our future work will focus on studying the expression profiles of a subset of microRNAs in a larger panel of cell lines and sarcoid tumours to help elucidate the significance of the deregulated expression.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The relationship between pelvic hindlimb lameness pointers remains unclear. Objectives To examine sacrum and tubera coxae (TC) based movement asymmetry across different lameness degrees, patterns and changes in pelvic rotation. Study design Parameter regression and rigid body model. Methods Vertical displacement of left and right tubera coxae (LTC, RTC) and sacrum was quantified experimentally in 107 horses with varying lameness degrees using inertial sensors. To investigate the theoretical relationship between pointers, a geometrical model of pelvis movement was created in Matlab. The model predicts TC movement based on experimentally derived pelvic rotation and computer-generated asymmetrical sacrum movement. Further, the effect of changes in pelvic rotation on TC-based lameness pointers was quantified. For both, experimental and model data, asymmetry measures corresponding to visual assessment strategies of veterinarians were calculated and contrasted. Results Experimental data showed that upward movement amplitudes for sacrum and TC were strongly correlated (r?≥?0.96). Regression showed that differences were greater between amplitudes of LTC/RTC than sacrum (slope 1.18; r2?=?0.94; P<0.001); however, for ratios the reverse held true (slope 0.86; r2?=?0.92; P<0.001). The model predicted experimentally determined tubera coxae asymmetry well. While the model data matched the experimental scaling relationship between amplitude ratios, it predicted a slightly shallower slope for amplitude differences. Perturbing the model with a different rotational range of movement, an offset in pelvic rotation and asymmetrical pelvic rotation affected observable TC-based asymmetry depending on the chosen assessment strategy. Conclusions Detecting lameness based on sacrum or comparative TC movement can give similar results. Using comparative TC movement for lameness detection would be susceptible to changes in pelvic rotation which a lame horse may adopt. Hence, assessment of multiple pelvis-based lameness pointers can help establishing nonobvious hindlimb lameness. Ethical animal research:?The experimental component of this study was approved by the RVC Ethics Committee. Some horses were included with owner informed consent and data from clinical cases were recorded as part of lameness investigations. Sources of funding:?S.D.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Epidemiological investigations suggest that soil macro- and micro-nutrients may be a trigger for the occurrence of equine grass sickness (EGS). However, there is limited information regarding relationships between exposure to geochemical elements and the occurrence of EGS. Objectives To determine whether the geographical distribution of EGS cases referred to the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies was associated with the presence or absence of particular geochemical elements in the environment. Study design A retrospective time-matched case?control study. Methods 455 EGS geo-referenced cases were identified between 1 January 1990 and 1 June 2006. Each case had 2 time-matched geo-referenced controls (n?=?910). For study purposes, cases or controls originating outwith Scotland were excluded. Environmental concentrations of a range of elements, most with known biological function, were collated from 2 geochemical point datasets and spatially extrapolated giving continuous cover across Scotland: the British Geological Survey (BGS) Geochemical Baseline Survey of the Environment (G-BASE) stream sediment dataset and the James Hutton Institute (JHI), National Soil Inventory of Scotland (NSIS). Data were analysed using multivariable conditional logistic regression. Results Statistically significant associations were obtained between the distribution of EGS cases and (i) higher environmental levels of Ca, K, Mo, Na, Se and Ti, and (ii) lower environmental levels of Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb. This study identified no association between EGS cases and the environmental concentrations of Ba, Ga, Fe, Mg, Mn, P or Sr. Conclusions A number of statistically significant associations were identified between EGS cases and element concentrations in the spatially extrapolated stream sediment and soil data. This information will assist future studies on the aetiology of EGS, with further research suggested to focus on those identified significant associations with greatest biological plausibility such as reduced levels of Cu and Zn, and higher levels of K and Se.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Colostrum acts as a source of immunomodulatory molecules for the neonate. Little information is available about the transfer of cytokines via colostrum in the foal. Objectives To investigate the transfer via colostrum of IL-4, IL-13, IL-8 and IFN-?. Study design Prospective observational study. Methods Jugular venous blood pre- (T0) and post suckling (T24) and colostrum were collected from 14 healthy foals and their dams. The cytokines? concentration was measured with an ELISA test. Serum IgG concentration was measured in foals at T24 with an immunoturbidimetric assay. Since data were not normally distributed, nonparametric tests for statistical analysis were used. The Wilcoxon t test evaluated the difference in each cytokine concentration between T0 and T24. Spearman rank correlation tested the association between cytokines? concentration in T24 serum and in colostrum, between T24?T0 (?T) serum concentration and colostrum concentration, and between cytokines serum concentration at T24 and IgG concentration. Results All the foals had a complete transfer of passive immunity. A statistically significant difference was found between serum IL-4 concentration at T0 and at T24. The significant correlations found were: serum IL-4 concentration at T24 with IL-4 concentration in colostrum, serum IL-13 concentration at T24 with IgG serum concentration, and IL-4 concentration in colostrum with ?T serum IL-4 concentration. Conclusions The results support the hypothesis that IL-4 is transferred via colostrum to the foal, as reported for TNF-α [1]. The presence of IL-8 in the foal's serum at T0 suggests an endogenous production. The IL-13 concentration is close to zero for the major part of serum and colostrum samples suggesting a subject-dependent immunologic response. The IFN-? is present both in colostrum and in T0 serum suggesting that foals are not deficient at birth.

AB  - Reasons for performing study The pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of different formulations of omeprazole have not been published. Objectives To compare the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of 4 commercially available formulations of omeprazole to an existing reference formulation. Study design A single dose cross-over bioequivalence study. Methods Six adult Thoroughbred horses were used. Two generic buffered formulations (OG and AG), one commercial enteric coated formulation (GZ) and one compounded enteric coated formulation (BO) were compared to the reference buffered formulation (GG). Each formulation was administered at a total dose of 2?g (equivalent to 4?mg/kg bwt for a 500?kg horse) in a cross-over design. Blood samples were collected at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 300 and 360?min, the plasma was separated and frozen. Plasma omeprazole concentrations were determined by UPLC-MS. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analyses were performed using PK Solver. Results The mean (± s.d.) area-under-the-curve (AUC0-t/0-inf_obs) (?g/ml*min), Cmax (?g) and Tmax (min) for each formulation was; OG ? 59.4?±?20.1, 0.37?±?0.12, 87.5?±?38.4; AG ? 77.3?±?53.7, 0.34?±?0.24, 170.0?±?62.0; GZ ? 102.9?±?51.1, 0.86?±?0.68, 67.5?±?29.6; BO ? 88.0?±?37.4, 0.59?±?0.39, 95.0?±?47.1; GG ? 57.5?±?35.3, 0.41?±?0.22, 57.5?±?19.9. Conclusions The results of this study suggest that differences are present between commercially available formulations of omeprazole. Caution should be exercised in extrapolating results of clinical studies from one formulation to another.

AB  - Reasons for performing study Biaxial fracture of the proximal sesamoid bones (PSB) is the leading cause of fetlock failure resulting in euthanasia in Thoroughbred racehorses in California, Kentucky and Hong Kong. Identifying alterable risk factors to reduce biaxial PSB fractures could have a significant impact on reducing the occurrence of catastrophic failure of the fetlock (CFF). Objectives We hypothesised that standing MRI (sMRI) would identify a greater degree of bone change in Thoroughbred racehorses with CFF from biaxial PSB fracture when compared to controls. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods Bone changes from Florida Thoroughbred racehorses with CFF due to biaxial fracture of the PSB (n?=?21) were compared to controls (n?=?53) using the sMRI. Data for control limbs were Florida racehorses that were subjected to euthanasia for reasons other than CFF (enteritis, pneumonitis, etc.). All forelimb fetlocks underwent sMRI imaging within 72?h of euthanasia. Bone scores were assigned to the subchondral bone (SCB) on the distal palmar aspect of the lateral and medial condyle of the third metacarpal bone (McIII) and the lateral and medial PSB. All information for analysis from sMRI images for cases and controls for all Thoroughbred racehorses was reviewed and collected by the lead author. The association between the dichotomous outcomes of PSB fracture with independent variables was assessed using bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis with significance set at P<0.05. Results The proportion of cases with >75% sclerosis of the ipsilateral lateral PSB (43%, 9/21) was significantly greater than that among controls (6%, 3/53). The proportion of cases with SCB lesion grade >3 of the contralateral palmar lateral condyle (29%, 6/21) was significantly greater than that among controls (0%, 0/53). Conclusions The sMRI identified a significantly greater degree of bone change in racehorses with PSB fracture compared to control horses. These identified changes may be useful as a screening tool to identify horses at increased risk of fetlock fracture during racing.

AB  - Reasons for performing study A nonchemical method of restraint to facilitate neonatal foal handling and minimally invasive procedures would be highly useful. Objectives To investigate squeeze-induced somnolence for providing adequate restraint of healthy neonatal foals for the purpose of plasma administration. Study design Prospective clinical study. Methods Squeeze-induced somnolence of neonatal foals was performed by use of a soft rope restraint as previously described [1] to allow intravenous catheterisation and plasma administration. Physiological and clinical parameters were monitored pre-, during and post squeeze-induced somnolence. Results Squeeze-induced somnolence and plasma administration was performed on 14 foals within the first day of life without any adverse effects. Mean time to recumbency during squeeze restraint was 53?s, mean time to stand and mean time to nurse from dam following release of restraint were 46?s and 163?s, respectively. Over 50% of foals gave some reaction to subcutaneous injection of local anaesthetic but only one foal reacted strongly. The restraint technique was performed without any difficulty in 8/14 foals, 5/14 foals became less somnolent latterly in the procedure (around 17?18?min) and one foal never became fully somnolent. Conclusions Squeeze-induced somnolence provides adequate restraint for plasma administration, without the need for sedation, in the majority of neonatal foals. Squeeze-induced somnolence can be used to allow nonchemical restraint of neonatal foals for routine procedures. Further refinement of the technique is required to maximise its potential usefulness. Ethical animal research:?The study was approved by the University of California Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Foals were included in the study with informed owner consent. Sources of funding:?Private anonymous donation. Competing interests:?None.

AB  - Abstract Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monogenic disease characterized by massive enlargement of fluid-filled cysts in the kidney. Due to its genetic pattern, the disease differs from other CKD. ADPKD is a multi-system, progressive disorder which is frequently complicated with hypertension, cardiovascular events and cerebrovascular disease. Thus, there are many clinical problems specific to ADPKD. In this article, we reviewed these clinical problems and their management in ADPKD with hemodialysis patients.

AB  - Tracheal collapse with axial rotation was diagnosed in four dogs. Radiographs showed increased tracheal dorsoventral height at the caudal cervical and thoracic inlet with and apparent intraluminal soft tissue opacity, mimicking an intraluminal tracheal foreign body. Computed tomography confirmed dorsoventral tracheal collapse with axial rotation in all dogs. Short-term outcome with medical treatment of all dogs was excellent.

AB  - Fifty cases (36 dogs and 14 cats) with a confirmed diagnosis of pyothorax were evaluated from five referral institutions in the UK and Ireland. Aetiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of all cases were examined. The underlying cause of pyothorax was determined in 18 per cent of cases. Positive bacteriological cultures of the pleural fluid were obtained in 68·7 per cent of the animals. Treatment modalities included surgery and medical management, involving thoracostomy tube placement, thoracic aspiration, thoracic lavage and antimicrobial therapy. A successful outcome was achieved in 86 per cent of patients.

AB  - A five-year-old, male crossbreed rabbit was referred for acute caudal abdominal swelling. On physical examination, the rabbit was slightly depressed and showed an enlarged subcutaneous cyst in the caudal abdomen and an adjacent small, ulcerated solid mass. A drainage tube was placed in the cystic area, and surgical resection of the solid mass was performed. The histopathological diagnosis of the mass was apocrine adenocarcinoma. To the authors? knowledge, this report describes the first case of spontaneous apocrine adenocarcinoma of possible sweat gland origin in a male rabbit.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the point prevalence of proteinuria in dogs presenting to the University of Georgia Oncology Service for the first time. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, 60 client-owned dogs with a confirmed cancer diagnosis were included but those with lower urinary tract neoplasia were excluded. Each dog's signalment, cancer diagnosis, previous cancer treatments, current medications and travel history were recorded. Renal values, electrolytes, packed cell volume, total solids, systolic blood pressure, urinalysis, urine protein:urine creatinine and retinal examinations were recorded. Non-proteinuric, borderline proteinuria and overt proteinuria were defined as urine protein:urine creatinine <0·2, ≥0·2 but <0·5, and ≥0·5, respectively. Urine culture was performed in dogs with active urine sediments or overt proteinuria. Results Twenty-nine dogs were non-proteinuric (48·3%), 22 (36·7%) borderline proteinuric and nine (15%) overtly proteinuric. None were azotaemic. Hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg) was detected in 18 (30%) dogs. Of these, six were non-proteinuric, nine borderline proteinuric, and three overtly proteinuric. Proteinuria was detected in 51% of dogs presented to our oncology service, the majority of which were classified as borderline. Clinical Significance The high proportion of proteinuria in dogs in this study suggests that screening for proteinuria in dogs with cancer may be prudent. Larger studies are required to correlate specific cancer types and the impact of treatment with the development, magnitude and persistence of proteinuria.

AB  - A transition from methadone to buprenorphine without intervening withdrawal symptoms is critical for advancing the treatment of opioid-dependent patients. Four pregnant inpatients were transferred from methadone (65?85 mg) to five days of immediate release morphine (IRM) and then to buprenorphine (12?28 mg). Withdrawal scores decreased during the five days of IRM and subsequently increased over the first three days on buprenorphine. The transitional use of IRM appears safe for both mother and fetus. Withdrawal symptoms appeared during buprenorphine induction; however, these data suggest that the intensity of withdrawal symptoms may be lessened by the dose and frequency of buprenorphine administration.
