AB  - Summary We performed a single centre, double blind, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority study comparing ultrasound-guided fascia iliaca block with spinal morphine for the primary outcome of 24-h postoperative morphine consumption in patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty under spinal anaesthesia with levobupivacaine. One hundred and eight patients were randomly allocated to receive either ultrasound-guided fascia iliaca block with 2 mg.kg?1 levobupivacaine (fascia iliaca group) or spinal morphine 100 ?g plus a sham ultrasound-guided fascia iliaca block using saline (spinal morphine group). The pre-defined non-inferiority margin was a median difference between the groups of 10 mg in cumulative intravenous morphine use in the first 24 h postoperatively. Patients in the fascia iliaca group received 25 mg more intravenous morphine than patients in the spinal morphine group (95% CI 9.0?30.5 mg, p < 0.001). Ultrasound-guided fascia iliaca block was significantly worse than spinal morphine in the provision of analgesia in the first 24 h after total hip arthroplasty. No increase in side-effects was noted in the spinal morphine group but the study was not powered to investigate all secondary outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Objective There is some speculation that an intact distal sphincter complex is of decisive importance for continence, although the external anal sphincter (EAS) is considered to be a single functional and anatomical entity. On trans-labial ultrasound (TLUS), the caudal slice at the level of the subcutaneous EAS is currently omitted from the diagnostic algorithm due to the prevalence of artefact at that level. Hence, we aim to determine the predictive value of assessment of the subcutaneous EAS for anal incontinence. Methods We analysed datasets of 463 women seen at our urogynaecological service in 2015. All underwent a standardized questionnaire including a St Mark's incontinence score (SMIS), clinical examination and 4D TLUS. Slices 1 to 7 were assessed and rated positive for a defect if the defect angle was >=30-degrees. Results While there was a highly significant association between all measures of anal incontinence (AI) and significant EAS trauma in slice 7, addition of the 7th slice to the existing 6-slice model did not improve the predictive value for AI. Conclusion As inclusion of the subcutaneous slice of the EAS on the TLUS does not seem to improve the predictive value of AI, the current methodology for EAS trauma on tomographic ultrasound can remain unchanged.

AB  - Background Multiple malformation syndromes are generally heterogeneous diseases with inappropriate clinical delineation most cases. Geneticists are facing problems with lack of proper knowledge inspite of the overwhelming information available regarding a certain syndrome. Emphasis should be placed on the characteristic features of the suspected syndrome, or any major or detectable minor anomaly with significant effect on the course of the pregnancy. Conclusion Detailed ultrasonography by experienced personnel provides a valuable tool in diagnosing morphological alterations of the fetus in mid-gestation. After termination of the pregnancy, the effected fetus must be examined thoroughly by an experienced fetopathologist. Careful and comprehensive examinations reveals all major and minor morphological alterations that might outline a certain syndrome or other multiple abnormality entity. Computer based syndromological programs are important in this process, for they help geneticists and fetopathologists by matching the most suitable syndrome to the given case. Genetic counseling can be completed only with the establishment of the most probable diagnosis. Declaration of recurrence rate and possible application of other prenatal diagnostic methods must be included in the counseling. Different types of multiple malformation syndromes of the fetus will be presented in the lecture.

AB  - Objective Since August 1998 we used the integrated 3-D software with the Siemens Elegra in order to evaluate fetoplacental vessels in the 3-D mode. Aim of the evaluation was to examine the feasibility of the application and to demonstrated potential clinical advantages. Methods In our antenatal clinic we recruited pregnant women between 12 and 38?weeks of gestation to take part in a feasibility study in order to evaluate the free-hand 3-D application using the 5.0?MHz transducer for routine antenatal scanning. We examined vasculatore within the placenta, intrathoracoabdominal and intracranial fetal vessels with the integrated powermode. Acquisition time for a volume date set is between 3 and 20?s depending on the resolution selected. Results Three-dimensional examination of the fetoplacental vessels is easily available using the Siemens Elegra, because no change in transducer is necessary. Our preliminary data show that we are able to demonstrate the complexity of intraplacental vasculature, which may be clinically helpful in the evaluation of twin placentas. Within the fetus the spatial arrangement of the vessels and their relation to each other can be depicted. This allows to study the fetal vascular tree and clearly discloses vascular anomalies. Conclusions Application of the integrated 3-D software within the Siemens Elegra for the first time allows the examination of the complex fetoplacental vascular tree in vivo. This may be clinically helpful in the differential diagnosis of fetal anomalies.

AB  - Summary Renal injuries are mostly managed conservatively. Operative intervention with view of kidney salvage is possible. However, nephrectomy may be the only option to control life-threatening haemorrhage. During the conservative period, it is extremely important to keep patients under close monitoring because this will allow early identification of patients who will require surgical intervention. Ureteral injuries are relatively rare and mostly iatrogenic. Management of the ureteral injuries depends level of injury, severity, and on time (early or late) of recognition of the injury. Careful assessment (cystoscopy with retrograde pyelogram) and appropriate imaging computed tomography urogram or intravenous pyelogram (IVP) are essential to select most suitable method of repair of ureteral injury.

AB  - Abstract Background The objective of this study was to compare pain intensity in patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy of the prostate with Penthrox alone compared with Penthrox plus periprostatic infiltration of local analgesia (PILA). Method Seventy-two subjects participated in this study after receiving appropriate education. Forty-two patients self-administered inhaled Penthrox (3?mL methoxyflurane) alone for analgesia (Group A), followed by 30 patients who self-administered Penthrox and received PILA with 5?mL of 2% lignocaine. All subjects had TRUS biopsy performed. Immediately after the procedure, patients were asked to rate their pain intensity using a numerical verbal rating scale from 0 to 10. Results Baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar. Patients in Group B reported significantly lower post TRUS biopsy median pain intensity of 2 (1?3) compared with Group A subjects who reported a median post TRUS biopsy pain intensity of 3 (2?5) (P = 0.014). A total of 72 men underwent TRUS-guided biopsy. All patients indicated they would be happy to have another TRUS-guided prostate biopsy in the future. Conclusion Our study shows that Penthrox plus PILA shows promise as an efficacious and easily tolerated analgesic technique for outpatient TRUS biopsy, keeping resource use to a minimum. Planning for a multi-centre, double-blind randomized control trial comparing Penthrox plus PILA with PILA alone is presently underway.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine whether focused cardiac ultrasound (FOCUS) performed by emergency and critical care (ECC) specialists or residents in training improves differentiation of cardiac (C) versus non-cardiac (NC) causes of respiratory distress in dogs compared to medical history and physical examination alone. Design Prospective cohort study (May 2014 to February 2016). Setting University hospital. Animals Thirty-eight dogs presenting with respiratory distress. Interventions FOCUS. Measurements and Main Results Medical history, physical examination, and FOCUS were obtained at presentation. Emergency and critical care clinicians, blinded to any radiographic or echocardiographic data, categorized each patient (C vs NC) before and after FOCUS. Thoracic radiography (within 3 h) and echocardiography (within 24 h) were performed. Percent agreement was calculated against a reference diagnosis that relied on agreement of a board-certified cardiologist and ECC specialist with access to all diagnostic test results. Reference diagnosis included 22 dogs with cardiac and 13 dogs with noncardiac causes of respiratory distress. In 3 dogs a reference diagnosis was not established. Prior to FOCUS, positive and negative percent agreement to detect cardiac causes was 90.9% (95% CI, 70.8?98.9) and 53.9% (25.1?80.8), respectively. Overall agreement occurred in 27 of 35 dogs (77.1%). Two C and 6 NC cases were incorrectly categorized. Following FOCUS, positive and negative percent agreement to detect cardiac causes was 95.5% (77.2?99.9) and 69.2% (38.6?90.9), respectively. Overall agreement occurred in 30 of 35 dogs (85.7%). Three dogs with discrepant pre-FOCUS diagnoses were correctly re-categorized post-FOCUS. One C and 4 NC cases remained incorrectly categorized. No correctly categorized dogs were incorrectly re-categorized following FOCUS. The proportions of dogs correctly classified pre- versus post-FOCUS were not significantly different (P = 0.25). Conclusions FOCUS did not significantly improve differentiation of C vs NC causes of respiratory distress compared to medical history and physical examination alone.

AB  - Objective To reveal the alterations in quality of life (QOL) in bone metastases patients after magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS). Methods This retrospective study enrolled 26 patients diagnosed with bone metastases. Patients had various primary malignant tumors and tumor lesions in different locations. All patients received MRgFUS for bone metastasis. Each focal spot sonication pulse that was applied to create energy deposition lasted 20?s and was performed at a frequency of 1.05?MHz. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used to measure pain level and the EORTC QLQ-BM22 was applied to evaluate QOL for 12?months. The lower the QLQ-BM22 score, the better the QOL of patients. Results The painful site subscale of the EORTC QLQ-BM22 was observed without significant change. Significant reductions in the functional subscales were observed after therapy compared with the baseline. The functional interference was reduced significantly during the first 12?months. From the 2-month time point onwards, the pain characteristics subscale also decreased significantly. VAS scores had decreased by 40.8% 1?month after the operation and had decreased 10.9% compared with VAS scores preoperation. Scores for pain characteristics decreased by 28.8% after the operation and the scores were still down by 10.8% 1?year after the treatment. VAS scores indicated a significant reduction in pain over the course of the research until the 12-month time point follow-up compared with the baseline. Conclusion MRgFUS therapy improved the QOL of patients with bone metastasis by relieving bone pain.

AB  - Abstract Severe hepatic trauma is a rare indication for liver transplantation (LT). We report our single-center experience of LT for hepatic trauma. Four new cases are discussed in light of a literature review in order to depict the pathways leading from hepatic trauma to LT and to assess the outcomes of this practice. LT is generally indicated in case of uncontrollable hemorrhage, acute liver failure, or post-traumatic late sequelae. Hepatic vessels thrombosis, sepsis, major hepatic resections, and a late referral are factors associated with the progression toward irreversible liver failure. Considering all reported cases, early patient and graft survival reached 68% and 62%, respectively, but in the last decade both have improved to 84%. LT after severe hepatic trauma is a sustainable practice considering the current good outcomes and the ineluctable death of these patients without LT.

AB  - MIST ultrasound, a recently FDA-cleared noncontact ultrasound therapy, was utilized prospectively in an IRB-approved trial for the treatment of recalcitrant wounds of various etiologies. Twenty-nine wounds from 23 patients were studied. Inclusion criteria included wounds greater than 4 weeks duration with no evidence of clinical improvement (>15% area reduction) over the prior 2 weeks before enrollment. The wounds were required to be free from clinical signs of infection. After an initial debridement and wash-out period, patients were treated 3 times a week with MIST for 4 minute treatment applications. Dressing regimens were left up to the investigator as dictated by wound conditions. The primary endpoint is complete healing. Data will be presented looking at MIST-derived healing, as defined by complete healing using MIST therapy all the way to closure. MIST-assisted healing, as defined by MIST therapy for wound bed preparation followed by an alternative means of closure will also be presented. ?Overall healing? defined by the combination of the two prior groups will complete the outcomes report, as this reflects a more ?real-world? clinical application for the technology. Wound dynamics, Kaplan Meier survival plots and laser Doppler imaging estimations of angiogenesis will all be presented. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - To purpose of this project was to evaluate the feasibility of performing off-line sonographic examinations over the internet using 3DUS data. To accomplish this we performed complete OB, pelvic, cardiac and abdominal studies following AIUM guidelines in 100 patients with 2DUS/3DUS methods including multiple volumes. Physicians performed a ?virtual re-scan? of the patient using 3DUS data that was compared retrospectively to the 2DUS diagnosis. Our overall results showed that both abnormal and normal findings were identified for both 2DUS and 3DUS studies. Outcome depended on sonographer training, image quality and patient motion. There were few false negative/positive results with either 2DUS or 3DUS studies. Proper training was essential to acquire sufficient volumes for a complete study and for complete patient evaluation. In conclusion, off-line virtual evaluation of patients is feasible using 3DUS data but has different technical requirements for acquisition and review than 2DUS studies. Proper training of sonographers, well defined scanning protocols and acquisition of sufficient volume data are essential to obtain diagnostic studies.

AB  - Abstract Pancreatic injury has a high morbidity and mortality. The integrity of the main pancreatic duct is the most important determinant of prognosis. Serum amylase, peritoneal lavage and computed tomography of the abdomen can assist with diagnosis but endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) is the most accurate investigation for diagnosing the site and extent of ductal disruption. However, it is invasive and can be associated with significant complications. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and secretin-enhanced MRCP probably parallel ERP in delineating pancreatic ductal injuries. They can also delineate the duct upstream to complete disruption, an area not visualized on ERP. In relation to therapy, endoscopic transpapillary drainage has been successfully used to heal duct disruptions in the early phase of pancreatic trauma and, in the delayed phase, to treat the complications of pancreatic duct injuries such as pseudocysts and pancreatic fistulae. Transpapillary drainage is especially effective in patients who have partial pancreatic duct disruption that can be bridged. Endoscopic transmural drainage has also been successfully used to treat post-traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts. Further large, prospective and randomized studies are required to adjudge the efficacy and long-term safety of pancreatic duct drainage in the treatment of post-traumatic pancreatic duct injuries.

AB  - A prospective, randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded study of diabetic foot ulcers was conducted to answer questions of safety and impact on wound healing of a noncontact ultrasound device. Standard of care included moist dressings, debridement, offloading, and adequacy vascular supply for both groups. Patients were randomized to receive a saline mist or 40?KHz ultrasound therapy delivered to the wound bed using the spray as the coupler. The study was 12 weeks in duration or until the wound closed. Sixty-six patients were entered with intent to treat. Fifty-five patients were evaluable and constitute the outcomes of the study. MIST therapy resulted in 42.3% rate of healing versus 14.3% for sham treated significant at 0.028 Chi square. Kaplan Meier survival plots resulted in p?<?0.0087?log rank and p?<?0.011 Wilcoxon. Rate of wound closure was 22% faster with MIST compared to sham treated patients. There was no statistically significant difference with regard to adverse events in any category (mild, moderate, or severe) MIST ultrasound therapy is a new, safe, novel FDA-cleared device that improves diabetic foot ulcer healing compared to standard of care. Details of the study will be presented. Acknowledgments:? This study was funded by Celleration Inc. Eden Prairie, MN.

AB  - Abstract Blunt chest trauma is a common occurrence in vehicle accident. Cardiac injuries following nonpenetrating thoracic trauma have been reported. ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) due to coronary artery involvement is a rare but extremely serious condition for the high risk of undetected diagnosis. Blunt thoracic trauma may obscure typical chest pain associated with cardiac ischemia especially in patients with high tolerance of pain or secondary administration of analgesic drugs. We report two consecutive cases of young adults admitted to our emergency department after motorcycle accident and concomitant anterior STEMI due to occlusion of left anterior descending artery. In both cases primary percutaneous coronary intervention with a second generation drug eluting stent implantation was successfully performed. Imaging with intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography showed the mechanisms of coronary occlusion, allowing an optimal stent implantation and avoiding procedural complications in this complex setting.

AB  - Purpose:?? We aimed to assess the management of colorectal and anal injuries in trauma patients at a single major metropolitan trauma hospital in Australia. Methods:?? A prospectively collected database at a major metropolitan trauma centre was assessed to retrieve consecutive patients who had colorectal and anal injuries over a 12?year period. Results:?? 185 patients were identified with colorectal or anal injuries from February 1996 to June 2008. The mechanism of injury was blunt in 145 (78%) with 134 (72%) related to motor vehicle trauma. The remaining 40 (22%) were due to penetrating injuries. There were 165 (89%) colonic injuries, 5 (3%) rectal injuries and 15 (8%) perineal injuries. 106 (57%) patients had multiple site of colonic or multiple organ injuries. 46 (25%) patients had full thickness tear of the colon with only 2 having full transection of the colon. The rest had contusions, serosal tears or mesocolon injury. The median injury severity score was 27 (range 4?75). 134 (72%) patients had surgical intervention including 61 repairs, 30 resections and 12 stomas, 3 of which occurred in major perineal injuries. The in hospital mortality rate was 5.4% with major or minor morbidity occurring in 52%. This included 3 anastomotic leaks and 2 missed injuries requiring a second laparotomy. 12 (6%) patients were subsequently readmitted after the initial management. Conclusion:?? Colorectal injuries are usually due to road trauma with the majority occurring in the colon and over half these patients have multiple injuries. The complication rate is significant but relatively few of these are related to anastomotic leak when primary anastomosis is undertaken. Stomas however continue to be used.

AB  - Abstract Background To date, the reliability of ultrasound imaging (USI) measures of the abdominal muscles in children and adolescents during the active straight leg raise (ASLR) test has not been confirmed. Objective To assess the intra-rater reliability of USI measures of the thickness and percentage thickness change of the external oblique (EO), internal oblique (IO), and transversus abdominis (TrA) on both sides of the body during the ASLR test in healthy adolescents. Design Single-group repeated-measures intra-rater reliability study. Setting School. Participants Thirty-nine adolescents between the ages of 13 and 16 years. Methods Three repeated USI measurements were recorded in the supine resting position and during the ASLR test at 2 sessions, 6 to 8 days apart. In the supine position, measurements were collected at the end of normal expiration. In the case of ASLR, measurements were collected when the person undergoing examination touched the transverse delimiter with the distal part of their lower leg, that is, to a 30° flexion of the hip. Main Outcome Measurements USI of abdominal muscle thickness. Results By using the mean of 3 measures in the supine, resting position, intra-examiner reliability point estimates (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]3.3) ranged from 0.95 to 0.97 for EO, IO, and TrA. During the ASLR test, the ICC result of thickness measurements of all muscles was also above 0.90. In terms of percentage change of muscle thickness, the highest ICC3.3 result obtained for the TrA was 0.81-0.85; for EO the result ranged from 0.72-0.89, and the result for the IO was between 0.65 and 0.79. Conclusion USI measurements of the thickness of the EO, IO, and TrA muscles at rest and during the ASLR test in healthy adolescents between 13 and 16 years of age are reliable. Because of an increase in the precision of measurements, we recommend using the mean of 3 consecutive measurements of the EO, IO, and TrA muscles in adolescents to ensure a good reliability level. Based on 3 consecutive measurements, good reliability for the percentage change in the TrA thickness was achieved.
