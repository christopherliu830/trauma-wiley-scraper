AB  - Introduction The objective of this study was to determine if yearlings would have higher oxidative stress and lower antioxidant status than mature mares after a single bout of intense exercise before and after training. Methods Seven Standardbred yearling fillies (18?±?2.4?mo) and seven mares (13?±?2.1?yr) ran a repeated sprints exercise test before (RSET1) and after (RSET2) an 8-wk training protocol. Blood samples and middle gluteal muscle samples were taken before and after exercise, and throughout recovery. Data is presented as mean?±?SE and all analyses were done in the context of a linear mixed model with random intercepts for horse. Results In RSET1, mares had higher plasma malondialdehyde than the yearlings (P<0.05), but the yearlings had higher muscle malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, glutathione and glutathione peroxidase, erythrocyte total glutathione and glutathione peroxidase (P<0.05). In RSET2, yearlings had higher plasma nitric oxide than the mares (P<0.05). In RSET2, the mares had lower plasma malondialdehyde, and higher muscle malondialdehyde, total glutathione and nitric oxide as compared to RSET1 (P<0.05). The yearlings in RSET2 had higher muscle nitric oxide and lower erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase than in RSET1 (P<0.05). Plasma cortisol, creatine kinase and muscle glutathione peroxidase had little difference with age or training. Conclusions Prior to training, the yearlings had lower lipid peroxidation and higher antioxidants than the mares. Training reduced oxidative stress and improved antioxidant status in the mares, while few effects of training were seen in the yearlings. This suggests that age is an important defense against exercise-induced oxidative stress. Ethical Animal Research Rutgers University Institutional Animal Care and Use Review Board approved the study.

AB  - Introduction In equestrian sports where horses exercise at submaximal levels, the identification of some clinical conditions leading to poor performance can remain difficult. The aim of this study was to design a graded exercise test, applicable in the field and to test the hypothesis that measured heart rate (HR) and lactate (LA) differ between healthy and subclinically-affected horses, according to diagnosis. Methods Fifty-four sport horses regularly participating in competitions were studied. A total of 106 examinations were performed, 85 were poor performance investigations (PP) and 21 were controls (C) in healthy performing individuals. The exercise test consisted of 4 consecutive 2-minute steps, 2 at trot and 2 at canter. Heart rate (HR), ECG and lactate (LA) were recorded. Blood samples, tracheal wash and bronchoalveolar lavage were systematically collected. Other examinations were performed when indicated. Differences in HR and LA between groups were compared using an ANOVA. Repeatability was checked in 12 horses. Results Tests were highly reproducible. Diagnoses included upper (15%) and lower (48%) respiratory, cardiac (12%), locomotor (25%), and muscular (17%) disorders. Although horses did not systematically exceed the lactate threshold, HR and LA at steps 2, 3 and 4 and recovery HR differed significantly between groups (P<0.001?0.03). The rate of increase in LA and HR varied according to diagnosis, with LA reaching significantly higher values in horses affected with cardio-respiratory conditions. Conclusions Field exercise testing in sport horses during the competitive season is a simple procedure that allows an objective measurement of the horse's capacity to exercise. The analysis of HR and LA provides indications for specific diagnostic examinations and helps assess the functional impairment caused by subclinical disease. Ethical Animal Research This study was based on clinical cases referred to the Equine Sports Medicine Practice. Horse owners referred their horses and consented to all procedures described.

AB  - Introduction Arabian horses have the best records in long distance endurance racing (80?160?km). The endurance horses are interesting models to calculate the heritability (h2) of exercise ability. Heritability indicates the percentage of trait transmitted by parents to their descendants (h2?=?Genetic variance/Total variance). In human athletes, heritability of physiological traits calculated using twin design were 0.12, 0.72 and 0.32 for VO2max, Heart Rate max and endurance capacity respectively. Heritabilities of 0.28 and 0.06 for speed and placing respectively are reported in endurance horses. The aim of this study was to calculate the heritability of recovery heart rate, cardiac recovery time and average speed in long distance endurance racing. Methods The results of 132 endurance races (80?160?km) from 2007 to 2011 were analyzed. The database included 4421 horses of known pedigrees representing 655 sires with a mean of 18.5 products per sire. The data were analyzed using Restricted Estimator of Maximal Likelihood (REML, VCE6) method with animal mixed model including country, ride distance, age, gender, common environment as fixed effects and animal genetic as random effect. Results Heritabilities (SE) were 0.12 (0.06), 0.15 (0.02) and 0.46 (0.08) for speed, recovery heart rate and cardiac recovery time respectively. Conclusions The speed and heart rate recovery seem more influenced by training and environmental effects than the cardiac recovery time which is more influenced by genetics. This high heritability is consistent with heritability of V200 found in French Trotter population previously and may indicate a putative quantitative trait linkage.

AB  - Introduction The Brazilian sport horse (BH) was specifically developed for jumping competition. Monocarboxylate transporters are key regulators of cell pH and therefore facilitate co-transport of protons and lactate. Lactate transport in red blood cells (RBCs) is bimodal (high [HT] and low transport [LT]) and is related to CD147 levels. This study aimed to quantify MCT1 and CD147 protein levels in BH after an incremental jumping test (IJT). Methods Sixteen horses were distributed into two groups: low-level jumpers (LL, n?=?8), able to jump up to 1.00?m, and high-level jumpers (HL, n?=?8), able to jump up to 1.20?m. The IJT consisted of three steps, each with forty jumps at increasing heights (0.40, 0.60, and 0.80?m). Blood samples were collected before and after the IJT. The YSI 2300 method was used to determine plasma lactate concentration [Lac]p. RBC membranes were purified, and MCT1 and CD147 levels were measured by Western blotting. A Student's t-test and Pearson's correlation (P<0.05) were employed. Results The HL group displayed lower [Lac]p, indicating prevalence of the aerobic pathway in this group. The results showed no difference in the expression of the transporters between times or groups and a positive correlation (r?=?0.67, P<0.0001) between MCT1 and CD147. In both groups [Lac]p didn't correlate with the amount of MCT1 or CD147. Most of the horses appeared to have high lactate transport activity. The CD147/MCT1 ratios for LL and HL were equal. Conclusions BH showed no difference in MCT1 and CD147 expression between conditioning levels.

AB  - Introduction Biochemical and hemogasometric parameters have been used to evaluate equine performance. This study evaluated blood biochemical and hemogasometry variables of horses during incremental jumping and speed tests. Methods Eighteen horses performed a jumping test with four steps over a vertical obstacle of 1.10?m height (10, 15, 20 and 25 jumps, respectively) totaling 70 jumps, and a speed test with six steps of one minute each with increasing speed from 2 to 8?m/s. Blood samples were collected before and immediately after each test to determine plasma lactate, hematocrit, total plasma protein, glucose, uric acid and hemogasometry variables. Results were analysed by ANOVA and compared by 5% Tukey test. Results Immediately after tests the hematocrit and total plasma protein decreased from 52.4% to 38.9%, and from 7.2 to 6.7?g/dl respectively, and the glucose increased from 98.3 to 109.8?mg/dl (P<0.05). The lactate and uric acid concentrations were higher with speed testing (7.97?±?4.8?mmol/l and 1.33?±?0.8?mg/dl respectively) than jumping testing (3.92?±?3.0?mmol/l and 1.24?±?0.9?mg/dl respectively). The blood pH was lower after speed testing (7.36?±?0.1) than the jumping test (7.40?±?0.04) (P<0.05). Blood pCO2, Na and K concentrations increased more after the speed test (53.38?±?7.3?mmHg/l; 139?±?3.0?mEq/l; 4.7?±?0.8?mEq/l respectively) than after the jumping test (49.34?±?3.2?mmHg/l; 138.3?±?2.3?mEq/l; 4.51?±?0.6?mEq/l respectively) (P<0.05). Blood pO2 was not different among tests (P>0.05). Conclusions Incremental jumping and velocity tests are useful tools for assessing performance of jumping horses. Differences among tests could evidence a smaller anaerobic contribution during jumping test.

AB  - Introduction In theory, splenic reserve mobilization should elicit a cardiopulmonary baroreceptor mediated neuroendocrine response (the Gauer-Henry reflex). Six intact (IN) and 5 (SP) splenectomized Standardbred mares (421?491?kg, ?9?yr) performed 10?min of treadmill exercise (80% VO2max) to test the hypothesis that hemodynamic and endocrine responses to exercise would differ between IN and SP horses Methods Blood samples were obtained before and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10?min of exertion. Right ventricular pressure (RVP), right atrial pressure (RAP), arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and cardiac output (CO) were measured and total peripheral resistance (TPR) calculated. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and vasopressin (AVP) concentrations were measured using RIA. Data analysis used ANOVA for repeated measures and SNK. Significance was set at P<0.05. There were no differences (P>0.05) between IN and SP for any variable at rest. All variables except TPR and RAP increased (P<0.05) during exertion in both IN and SP. Means (±SE) for RAP (18?±?3 vs. 1?±?2?mmHg), CO (255?±?21 vs.177?±?19?L/min), MAP (147?±?3 vs. 116?±?8?mmHg), and ANP (66?±?3 vs. 50?±?8?pg/mL) were greater for IN vs. SP horses at 10?min of exertion. Mean plasma AVP (95?±?19 vs. 23?±?3?pg/mL) was greater (P<0.05) for SP than for IN horses at 10?min of exertion.

AB  - Introduction Horses are usually transported before competitions. The aim of this study was to compare the lactate response in horses on two diets that were transported or not transported before exercise. Methods Six trained and raced Standardbred trotter mares, all accustomed to transportation, were used. Two diets were fed in two periods of 29 days in a crossover design; one forage-only diet (F) and one diet with 50% of DM intake from forage and 50% from oats (FO). The horses had slow exercise 1?3 times/week (approximately 1?h walk and slow trot [6?7?m/s]) and intensive exercise1?2 times/week (4000?m slow trot warm-up, 2000?m at 10?11?m/s on a race track or five 500?m intervals at 9?m/s on a slope, slow trot downhill). At day 21, horses were subjected to transport for 100 kilometres before they performed an exercise test (TT) (4000 meter warm-up [6.3?10?m/s] and 2140?m ?race? [11.6?12.7?m/s]). At day 26, the horses performed a control test (CT) where they were kept in their stall before the exercise test was performed. Blood samples were collected after the finish line and 10 and 30?min post-exercise. Plasma lactate (Lac) was analysed using a spectrophometric method. ANOVA was performed using PROC MIXED (significant difference P<0.05). Results There was no difference in Lac (after finish and 10 and 30?min post-exercise) between diets (F: 14.9 vs. FO: 17.1?mmol/l SEM: 2.1) or exercise tests (TT: 15.9 vs. CT: 16.1?mmol/l SEM 2.0). Conclusions Diet and transport seem not to affect post-exercise plasma lactate in experienced competition horses transported 100?km.

An unusual manifestation of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder in the lip after pediatric heart transplantation. ?Pediatr Transplantation 2012. ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? PTLD is a serious and frequently observed complication after solid organ transplantation. We present a six-yr-old girl with a rapidly growing, solid tumor of the lip four?yr after orthotopic heart transplantation, which was classified as monomorphic PTLD with the characteristics of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Treatment with reduction in immunosuppression, ganciclovir, and anti B-cell monoclonal antibody (rituximab) resulted in full remission since 12?months. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first description of PTLD in the lip in a pediatric patient after heart transplantation in the English literature.

AB  - Background: Conjunctival melanoma is an uncommon malignancy with the potential for significant morbidity. Ulceration is known to be an indicator of more aggressive cutaneous melanoma. This factor has not been previously evaluated in conjunctival melanoma. Methods: Twenty-six patients with conjunctival melanoma who underwent excision by a single surgeon at a cancer referral center treated between June 2003 and July 2008 were included. The medical records were reviewed for clinical and pathological data. Outcomes assessed included local recurrence, regional lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, use of adjuvant topical chemotherapy or adjuvant radiation therapy, final visual acuity and death. Results: Local recurrence was seen in three patients (12%). Regional lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis were each seen in four patients (15%). Tumors >2.0 mm thick were more likely to develop distant metastasis than those with a thickness of <2.0 mm (p = 0.0331). Ulceration was noted in 10 of 26 patients. Regional lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis were each seen in 4 of 10 patients with ulceration, and none of the patients without ulceration. Conclusions: Ulceration in conjunctival melanoma may be an important histopathologic predictor of a more aggressive tumor. Globe-sparing multi-modality management of conjunctival melanoma can yield acceptable rates of local?regional recurrence. Savar A, Esmaeli B, Ho H, Liu S, Prieto VG.

AB  - Introduction Body composition including percentage of fat, fat mass and fat-free mass (FFM) is an important consideration for athletes. An evaluation of FFM in racehorses concluded that racing performance is positively correlated with FFM both pre- and post-training. Athletic performance is influenced by interactions among the environment and genes that influence anatomical, metabolic and physiological traits relevant to exercise. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of genetic variation in six candidate genes with functions in growth and metabolism (IL1RA, PTPN1, MC3R, IGF1, LEPR and MSTN) on FFM in Thoroughbreds. Methods FFM was calculated from rump fat thickness measured ultrasonographically in 110 two-year-old Thoroughbred horses-in-training in the same yard after two (T2) and eight (T8) months of training. Twenty-one SNPs in six genes were selected from the EquCab2.0 SNP database and were genotyped for all horses using custom Sequenom SNP genotyping assays. Quantitative tests of association were performed between SNPs and FFM at T2 and T8, and the FFM ratio between the two time points (T2?:?T8) using PLINK software. Results Two SNPs in both the IGF1 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1) and PTPN1 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1) genes were significantly associated with FFM (T2) (P<0.05). The two IGF1?SNPs and two LEPR (Leptin Receptor) gene SNPs were significantly associated with FFM (T8) (P<0.05). One LEPR?SNP was significantly (P<0.005) associated with changes in FFM (T2?:?T8). Conclusions These results suggest a genetic contribution to FFM variation in Thoroughbreds. Further validation will determine whether these SNPs may be used to predict the effects of training on FFM.

AB  - Introduction Kinematic studies, using reflective skin markers, are commonly used to investigate equine neck motion in equitation science and for rehabilitation purposes. In order to interpret the registrations accurately, the degree of skin displacement has been described for the limbs and back, but not for the neck. The aim of the present study was to investigate the degree of skin displacement in the equine neck. Methods Radiopaque skin markers were applied to the skin over the first six cervical vertebrae of six healthy horses. Radiographs were taken in three standardized neck positions in the sagittal plane: control (horizontal neck), ?on the bit? and ?nose to carpus?. The scales of the images were normalized and calculation of skin displacement was performed by use of a coordinate system, dividing the displacement into measurements on an x-axis parallel to the vertebra's longitudinal axis and a y-axis perpendicular to the x-axis. The non-parametric paired Wilcoxon rank test was employed to study the differences in distances in x- and y-directions, and statistical significance was set to P<0.05. Results Between control and ?nose to carpus? positions, there were significant differences in the marker locations, related to the underlying vertebra, in x-line for C1?6, and in y-line for C3?6. The differences in marker locations were between 3?±?9 and 44?±?14?mm, depending on the marker. Conclusions The outcome of this study indicates that skin displacement is an important factor to consider when investigating equine neck motion with skin marker methodology.

AB  - Introduction Asymmetry of the horse and rider partnership is a challenging and complex area. There is limited scientific research regarding the occurrence of misalignments in the horse and rider, and if there is any relationship between the two. This study investigated asymmetry of single horse and rider combinations focusing on pelvis asymmetry. Methods 14 single horse/rider combinations (minimum 6 month partnership) on the same daily routine were assessed. Horses and riders were assessed for misalignments of the pelvis, spine, and neck by a fully qualified human and animal (McTimoney) practitioner on the same day. Triplicate measurements of rider dorsal iliac crest (IC) distance (nearest 0.2?cm) and degree of tilt (0d.p) were recorded, sitting and standing, using a PALM palpation meter to calculate IC height discrepancy. Triplicate horse tuber coxae (TC) heights (nearest 0.5?cm) were measured using a plumb line. Difference between means indicated direction and value of asymmetry relative to symmetry of zero. Student's t-test and Pearson's Product Moment correlation examined asymmetry relationships. Results Mean rider IC height discrepancy, standing, was 0.89?±?0.64?cm and sitting, 1.00?±?0.66?cm. Mean TC height discrepancy was 1.3?±?1.6?cm. Asymmetry of the pelvis was a feature of 93% of horse/rider combinations, 85% occurring in the same direction. There was a significant positive correlation between horse TC and rider IC height discrepancies (r2?=?0.4, F?=?8.24, P?=?0.014). Conclusions This study provides positive evidence of a relationship between the direction of horse pelvic rotation and rider pelvic tilt and also between the degree of tilt and rotation. This has implications for physical therapy treatment of horse and rider. Further research of causal effect relationships of the asymmetries is recommended.

AB  - Introduction The simplest model of circular locomotion is a point mass moving uniformly on a circle. To produce circular motion, a centripetal force is generated. This study investigated contributions of individual limbs to the net centripetal force in horses trotting on a circle. Methods Six horses trotted on a 6?m diameter circle at their preferred speed. Optical motion capture (Motion Analysis Corp) recorded kinematics, while six force plates (AMTI) recorded ground reaction forces (GRF). Whole body center of mass (CoM) was computed using a 23-segment rigid body model. The GRF of each limb was expressed at the CoM in cylindrical coordinates centered at a best-fit circle of the ground path of the CoM. Average vertical, tangential and radial force components were computed for each limb over the whole stride duration. Forces were analyzed using ANOVA with Tukey HSD post-hoc tests. Results The maximum ground-path deviation of the CoM from the best-fit circle among all trials was only 2.8% of the radius. The forelimbs contributed an average centripetal (radial) force of 0.49 ± 0.16?N/kg (mean ± SD, normalized to body mass), which was significantly greater (P<0.001) than the hind limb contribution of 0.36 ± 0.13?N/kg. There was no significant difference between inside and outside limbs. Conclusions The contribution of individual limbs to the centripetal force provided a direct indication of their role in circular locomotion. The forelimbs generated significantly more centripetal force, possibly in direct relation to their greater support of the body mass against gravity.

AB  - Introduction Direct measurement of peak vertical force in equine forelimbs and hindlimbs under training conditions has not been achieved to date. This measurement is possible using dynamometric horseshoes (DHSs). The objectives of this study were to investigate, on a firm surface, the effect of speed on stride parameters and on vertical loading in the forelimb (FL) compared to the hindlimb (HL). Methods Right front and hind hooves of 5 trotters were equipped with a DHS. A linear corridor was delimited on a firm sand training track. Each horse alternately repeated trials (harness trot) at 25, 35 and 40?km/h (4 to 6 times at each speed). For each trial, stride parameters and dynamic variables (peak vertical force and impulse, vertical loading rate) were analysed for 10 successive strides. Correlation coefficients were calculated to quantify the association between speed and the studied variables; linear mixed-effects regression models were used to test the significance (P<0.05) of these associations. Results Stance and stride duration, and their ratio (duty factor) were linearly correlated with speed (r<-0.82), both in FL and HL. Peak vertical force was the only variable for which r was higher in HL (r?=?0.80 vs. 0.50 in FL). The relationship between vertical loading rate and speed had the highest r of all dynamic variables (r?=?0.87 and 0.83, respectively in FL and HL; r?=?-0.75 and ?0.60 for vertical impulse). Conclusions The linear relation between peak vertical force and speed demonstrated in the hindlimb differs from previous studies at lower speed. These results stress the necessity of performing biomechanical measurements under real training conditions.

AB  - Introduction Minimal research has examined the effect of draft loading on equine muscle activity. It is hypothesised that increases in draft load of 10 and 20% body mass (BM) will increase EMG intensity and duration of vastus lateralis (VL) and gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) during walk. Methods Data were collected from six Irish Cob geldings (11?±?4 years; height: 1.47?±?0.05?m; BM: 490?±?65?kg) all trained to draft-load. A modified lorry tyre was used as a loading platform. Surface EMG electrodes were positioned over VL and GL. An accelerometer placed on the left hind hoof collected kinematic data. EMG and accelerometer data at a draft load equivalent to 0 (zero load), 10 and 20% BM were recorded as the horses were led at walk in a 20?m straight line. A stopwatch determined mean speed over 20?m. Mean kinematic and EMG values were determined for 10 consecutive strides. EMG intensities were normalised to each horse. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test explored data normality. Friedman test (P<0.05) compared between conditions. A pair-wise Wilcoxon signed ranks test identified where the differences lay. Results Data for one horse was excluded because of poor accelerometer data. The remaining horses (n?=?5) maintained a constant velocity (1.10?±?0.02?m/s {SD}) between conditions (P>0.7). VL and GL increased their muscular activity in terms of EMG intensity and duration of contraction with increasing draft load from 0 to 10% and 10 to 20% BM (P?=?0.04; n?=?5). Conclusions Draft loading can be utilised for strength training following injury or to improve athletic performance.

AB  - Introduction Thoroughbred foals are born with fully developed hooves and stand within minutes. A ring in the horn occurs at birth and grows down the hoof wall, marking the fetal hoof (distal) and foal hoof (proximal). Birth rings in hoof horn have been noted in other species and used to estimate age. Hoof wall renewal in all ages of horse has been poorly reported; horn growth and complete hoof capsule renewal has not been measured in Thoroughbred foals. Partial hoof wall avulsions are relatively common. The objective was to measure the time taken for the fetal hoof of a newborn foal to grow out and be replaced by hoof grown since birth. Methods Thoroughbred foals (N?=?150) on four Newmarket stud farms were studied during June to September. The age of the foal and the day that routine hoof trimming removed the remnants of the fetal hoof of the front hooves was recorded. Foals that were on restricted exercise, ill or where the remnants of the fetal hoof still remained after trimming were excluded from the data. 45 foals fulfilled the criteria. The data were tabulated in Excel, analysed in Minitab and assessed for normality (Anderson-Darling). Results The mean age at which the fetal hoof grew out was 145?±?15 days (95% confidence interval, 141.77?147.16). Conclusions Thoroughbred foals replace the fetal hoof at twice the speed given for mature horses (270?365 days). Knowing the time of hoof renewal will allow accurate predictions of healing to be made in cases of partial hoof wall avulsion and other hoof lesions.

AB  - Introduction Rider preference appears to be a large factor determining the selection of an arena surface. The negative reaction of the competitors to the surface used for the Olympic test event in 2011 was sufficient to initiate a change in the surface composition used for the Olympic equestrian events in 2012. The aim of this study was to quantify surface characteristics that riders perceive to be the most favoured in a training and competition venue. Methods A survey was used to ask riders (n?=?342) to describe characteristics that they liked about their favourite venue across Northern England. The two most popular surfaces (both well-established wax, sand and fibre) were harrowed before being measured at several plots. An Orono Biomechanical Surface Tester and traction device were used to compare the functional properties of the two surfaces. The respondent's reasons for choosing their favourite venue were associated with specific surface measures including peak load, rebound timing and traction. A Mann-Whitney U test was used to establish differences between venues. Results The favourite venue was selected because the surface was not too deep or slippery and provided good support, spring and cushioning. The peak load (P?=?0.002) and traction (P>0.001) were significantly higher on the favourite surface compared to the second favourite (18.99?kN vs.17.29?kN and 20?Nm vs.19?Nm respectively). Conclusions Higher peak load values may be responsible for supporting a good performance and higher traction values could explain why riders felt that the surface was not ?slippery?, although this may have negative effects on the horse. The results suggest there is potential to quantify rider preferences.
