AB  - The complexity of neurodevelopment, the rapidity of early neurogenesis, and over 100 years of research identifying environmental influences on neurodevelopment serve as backdrop to understanding factors that influence risk and severity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This Keynote Lecture, delivered at the May 2016 annual meeting of the International Society for Autism Research, describes concepts of causation, outlines the trajectory of research on nongenetic factors beginning in the 1960s, and briefly reviews the current state of this science. Causal concepts are introduced, including root causes; pitfalls in interpreting time trends as clues to etiologic factors; susceptible time windows for exposure; and implications of a multi-factorial model of ASD. An historical background presents early research into the origins of ASD. The epidemiologic literature from the last fifteen years is briefly but critically reviewed for potential roles of, for example, air pollution, pesticides, plastics, prenatal vitamins, lifestyle and family factors, and maternal obstetric and metabolic conditions during her pregnancy. Three examples from the case-control CHildhood Autism Risks from Genes and the Environment Study are probed to illustrate methodological approaches to central challenges in observational studies: capturing environmental exposure; causal inference when a randomized controlled clinical trial is either unethical or infeasible; and the integration of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental influences on development. We conclude with reflections on future directions, including exposomics, new technologies, the microbiome, gene-by-environment interaction in the era of ?omics, and epigenetics as the interface of those two. As the environment is malleable, this research advances the goal of a productive and fulfilling life for all children, teen-agers and adults. Autism Res 2018, 11: 554?586. ? 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay Summary This Keynote Lecture, delivered at the 2016 meeting of the International Society for Autism Research, discusses evidence from human epidemiologic studies of prenatal factors contributing to autism, such as pesticides, maternal nutrition and her health. There is no single cause for autism. Examples highlight the features of a high-quality epidemiology study, and what comprises a compelling case for causation. Emergent research directions hold promise for identifying potential interventions to reduce disabilities, enhance giftedness, and improve lives of those with ASD.

AB  - Charcoal hemoperfusion is an effective treatment in acute drug intoxication with small volume of distribution. For certain drugs, clearance rates are higher with hemoperfusion than hemodialysis. We describe a patient with severe valproic acid overdose who developed severe hemolysis and acute renal failure related to charcoal hemoperfusion treatment. A 50-year-old female was admitted to the hospital following valproic acid overdose. Initial valproic acid level was 73.6?mg/L, and she was treated with oral activated charcoal. Four hours later she developed mental status changes with valproic acid level at 490.9?mg/L and prolonged QT interval. Charcoal hemoperfusion was started with blood flow rate 400?ml/min. Patient developed bleeding with evidence of severe Before(*C.H.) After (C.H.)

She received transfusion of packed red blood cells, platelets, and fibrin. Over the next few days she developed oligouric acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis for 2 weeks. Eventually hemolysis resolved and the renal function improved (kidney biopsy was consistent with acute tubular necrosis). To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of severe intravascular hemolysis occurring during the charcoal hemoperfusion treatment. Etiology includes mechanical trauma to the red cells, probably related to high blood flow rate through the charcoal column.

AB  - Abstract In an open-chest porcine model, we examined whether myocardial pharmacological conditioning at the time of reperfusion with low-dose insulin or insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), not affecting serum glucose levels, could reduce infarct size and improve functional recovery. Two groups of anaesthetized pigs with either 60 or 40 min. of left anterior descending artery occlusion (total n = 42) were randomized to receive either 0.9% saline, insulin or IGF2 infusion for 15 min., starting 5 min. before a 180-min. reperfusion period. Repeated fluorescent microsphere injections were used to confirm ischaemia and reperfusion. Area at risk and infarct size was determined with Evans blue and triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Local myocardial function was evaluated with multi-layer radial tissue Doppler strain and speckle-tracking strain from epicardial echocardiography. Western blotting and TUNEL staining were performed to explore apoptosis. Infarct size did not differ between treatment groups and was 56.7 ± 6.8%, 49.7 ± 9.6%, 56.2 ± 8.0% of area at risk for control, insulin and IGF2 group, respectively, in the 60-min. occlusion series. Corresponding values were 45.6 ± 6.0%, 48.4 ± 7.2% and 34.1 ± 5.8% after 40-min. occlusion. Global and local cardiac function did not differ between treatment groups. No differences related to treatment could be found in myocardial tissue cleaved caspase-3 content or the degree of TUNEL staining. Reperfusion therapy with low-dose insulin or with IGF2 neither reduced infarct size nor improved function in reperfused myocardium in this in vivo porcine model.

AB  - Summary Background Suspensory ligament branch injuries are common in horses. Most of these injuries are grouped together and considered as a single pathologic entity. Objectives To report a specific injury of the abaxial margin of the suspensory ligament branches and to report its surgical management and outcome. Study design Retrospective case series. Methods All horses with suspensory ligament branch injuries over a 9-year period (2007?2015) were identified. Horses with injuries which, on ultrasonographic examination, appeared to have defects in the abaxial margin of the suspensory ligament branch, that were subsequently confirmed during surgery were selected. Results Twenty-nine cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria with a specific lesion location on the abaxial margin of the suspensory ligament branch. Nineteen horses raced successfully after surgery, nine returned to training but failed to race and one was lost to follow-up. Main limitations The absence of a comparable population of non-surgically managed horses in this study means that the contribution of removing torn tissue cannot confidently be assessed. Conclusions The location and morphology of injuries described in this study is consistent, which suggests aetiopathogenic commonality. This case series suggests this type of injury has an identity of its own, differs from other types of suspensory ligament branch injuries and represents a previously undescribed subgroup.

As a result, a multitude of treatments, both conservative and surgical, have been advocated for dorsal displacement of the soft palate (DDSP). This tutorial article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the disorder, discussing aetiopathogenesis, diagnosis and management in turn.

Five dogs (14 per cent) showed an increase in murmur grade on repeat visit. Six dogs (17 per cent) showed an increase in aortic velocity of greater than 20 per cent. Eight dogs (23 per cent) had developed aortic valvular or subvalvular twcbdimensional echocardiographic changes that had not been present at the initial visit. Seven dogs (20 per cent) had developed aortic regurgitation, and three dogs (8 per cent) mitral regurgitation.

AB  - Abstract Current development of endoscopic technology, lithotripters, and stone-retrieval devices has expanded the indications for retrograde and antegrade endoscopic therapy in the management of urolithiasis. This technology has also resulted in minimally invasive therapy. As surgeons? experience of endourological procedures with the newer instruments has become integrated, the surgical technique and indications for urolithiasis have also changed in the past few years. The present review provides an overview of endourological procedures for upper urinary tract stones and the key points related to surgical techniques.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the isoflurane sparing effect of intratesticular lidocaine administration in dogs undergoing castration. Methods Thirty dogs received a standardised anaesthetic regimen including systemic analgesia with intramuscular buprenorphine at a dose of 0·02 mg/kg and intravenous carprofen at a dose of 4 mg/kg. Dogs were randomly assigned to a lidocaine group receiving 1 mg/kg lidocaine into each testis or a control group receiving no lidocaine. Baseline physiological parameters were measured after 10 minutes at an end-tidal isoflurane concentration of 1·3%. End-tidal isoflurane concentration was altered throughout surgery to maintain these parameters within 10% of baseline and recorded at five time points. T0 was baseline, T1 was the start of surgery, T2 to T3 were clamping of the testicular pedicles and T4 was skin closure. End-tidal isoflurane concentrations were compared using analysis of variance and Bonferroni tests. Results Fifteen healthy dogs were included in each study group. End-tidal isoflurane concentration was significantly lower in the lidocaine group compared to the control group at T2 (P<0·01), T3 (P<0·01) and T4 (P<0·01). Clinical Significance Intratesticular lidocaine reduces isoflurane requirements in dogs undergoing castration.

AB  - Abstract Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a systemic disorder affecting elastic tissues most markedly in skin, retina, and blood vessels. It is caused by mutations in the ABCC6 gene and is transmitted in an autosomal recessive fashion. In 1994 a new classification system for PXE was published as the result of a consensus conference. Since then the ABCC6 gene has been discovered. We propose that there is a need for a classification system incorporating all relevant systemic symptoms and signs, based on standardized clinical, histological, and molecular biological examination techniques. We re-evaluated the histopathologic PXE signs and propose a classification system with unambiguous criteria leading to a consistent diagnosis of definitive, probable, or possible PXE world-wide. We put this proposed classification forward to encourage further debate on the diagnosis of this multi-organ disorder. ? 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background: Several studies reported some success toward regeneration in infrabony defects using enamel matrix derivative (EMD). Clinically and statistically significant improvements in probing depth reduction, clinical attachment levels, and bone fill have been demonstrated. This multi-center study evaluated the potential for sensitization to EMD in a subgroup of periodontal patients treated at least twice with at least 2 months between treatments. Methods: Three hundred seventy-six (376) patients in 11 university-based postgraduate periodontics programs and five private practices were selected. Surgeries were performed on infrabony defects. Following reflection of mucoperiosteal flaps and debridement of the root surface and defect, root conditioning (either citric acid pH = 1 or 24% EDTA) was performed and the site was irrigated with sterile saline. Enamel matrix derivative was reconstituted and applied to the exposed root surface and the bony defect. Flaps were sutured and pressure applied for 5 minutes. The second test defect was treated in a similar manner at least 8 weeks after the first surgery. The patient was given a diary card where any subjective adverse events (erythema, swelling, itching, headache, root hypersensitivity, or pain) were recorded at weeks 1 and 2 post-surgery. In addition, objective adverse events (gingival inflammation, ulcers, abscess, cratering, and lesions) were recorded by the investigator on an adverse event form. Results: No clinical adverse reactions to multiple applications of EMD were noted. Of 376 patients, two were referred to a dermatologist for evaluation, but neither had signs indicating any adverse events due to EMD treatment. Instead their reactions were classified as a small local abscess and tinea cruris. The single immunoassay performed (on the patient with a small local abscess) did not demonstrate any EMD-reactive antibodies, neither IgE nor IgG. Other subjective/objective reactions that occurred during this study were of the type that are commonly experienced by patients immediately following periodontal surgery, but were not related to EMD. They included headache, swelling, itching, pain, and root hypersensitivity. Conclusions: This study demonstrated a lack of clinical adverse reactions following two separate applications of EMD. Any subjective/objective adverse reactions experienced by the patient were typical complications following routine periodontal surgery and were not directly related to the use of enamel matrix derivative.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: Danofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone developed for veterinary medicine showing an excellent activity. However, danofloxacin pharmacokinetics profile have not been studied in horses previously. Objective: To study the pharmacokinetics following i.v., i.m. and intragastric (i.g.) administration of 1.25 mg/kg bwt danofloxacin to 6 healthy horses. Methods: A cross-over design was used in 3 phases (2 times 2 ? 2), with 2 washout periods of 15 days (n = 6). Danofloxacin (18%) was administered by i.v. and i.m. routes at single doses of 1.25 mg/kg bwt. For i.g. administration an oral solution was prepared and administered via nasogastric tube. Danofloxacin concentrations were determined by HPLC assay with fluorescence detection. Tolerability at the the site of i.m. injection was monitored by creatine kinase (CK) activity. Results: Danofloxacin plasma concentration vs. time data after i.v. and i.g. administration could best be described by a 2-compartment open model. The disposition of i.m. administered danofloxacin was best described by a one-compartment model. The terminal half-lives for i.v., i.m. and i.g. routes were 6.31, 5.36 and 4.74 h, respectively. Clearance value after i.v. dosing was 0.34 l/kg bwt/h. After i.m. administration, absolute bioavailability was mean ± s.d. 88.48 ± 11.10% and Cmax was 0.35 ± 0.05 mg/l. After i.g. administration, absolute bioavailability was 22.36 ± 6.84% and Cmax 0.21 ± 0.07 mg/l. CK activity following i.m. dosing increased 3-fold over pre-injection levels 12 h after dosing and subsequently approached (but did not reach) normal values at 72 h post dose. Conclusions: Systemic danofloxacin exposure achieved in horses following i.m. administration was consistent with the predicted blood levels needed for a positive therapeutic outcome for many equine infections. Conversely, danofloxacin utility by the i.g. route was limited by low bioavailability. Tolerability associated with i.m. administration was high. Potential relevance: Pharmacokinetics, blood levels and good tolerability of i.v. and i.m. administration of danofloxacin in horses indicates that it is likely to be effective for treating sensitive bacterial infections.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of hypofractionated stereotactic volumetric-modulated arc radiotherapy in treating canine adrenal tumours with vascular invasion. Methods A single-arm clinical study was performed. The dogs underwent total body computed tomography, brain and abdomen magnetic resonance imaging and endocrine assay. Adrenal masses were classified as cortisol-secreting adrenal tumour or non-secreting adrenal tumour. Radiotherapy treatments were delivered by hypofractionated stereotactic volumetric-modulated arc radiotherapy via a linear accelerator. The overall survival was estimated by the Kaplan?Meier method. The overall response and radio-toxicity effects were determined. Results Nine dogs were enrolled. Three dogs were affected by cortisol-secreting adrenal tumours and the remaining dogs had non-secreting adrenal tumours. The prescribed doses ranged from 30 to 45?Gy in three or five consecutive daily fractions. The median overall survival time was 1030 days, and the overall mean reduction of the diameter and volume were ~32 and 30% respectively. The endocrine profile normalised in two dogs with cortisol-secreting adrenal tumours. Radio-toxicities were mild and self-limiting. Seven deaths were recorded during the follow-up period and two dogs were censored. Clinical Significance Hypofractionated stereotactic volumetric-modulated arc radiotherapy should be considered as a feasible and effective therapeutic option for adrenal tumours with vascular invasion.

AB  - Abstract A 7-week-old Labrador retriever presented for further investigation into acute onset regurgitation, following weaning from liquid to solid food. A videofluoroscopic swallow study demonstrated a severe, focal esophageal dilation in the mid-cervical region, with marked luminal narrowing distally. Computed tomography with angiography revealed esophageal stenosis, extending from C4?T2, secondary to circumferential esophageal wall thickening. With the concern for development of secondary aspiration pneumonia, the owners elected to euthanize the dog and consented to postmortem examination. A diagnosis of segmental, cervical esophageal muscular hypertrophy was made on necropsy, consistent with the fibromuscular thickening type of congenital esophageal stenosis reported in humans.

AB  - Background The present interdisciplinary consensus review proposes clinical considerations and recommendations for anaesthetic practice in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery with an Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) programme. Methods Studies were selected with particular attention being paid to meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials and large prospective cohort studies. For each item of the perioperative treatment pathway, available English-language literature was examined and reviewed. The group reached a consensus recommendation after critical appraisal of the literature. Results This consensus statement demonstrates that anaesthesiologists control several preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative ERAS elements. Further research is needed to verify the strength of these recommendations. Conclusions Based on the evidence available for each element of perioperative care pathways, the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS ?) Society presents a comprehensive consensus review, clinical considerations and recommendations for anaesthesia care in patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery within an ERAS programme. This unified protocol facilitates involvement of anaesthesiologists in the implementation of the ERAS programmes and allows for comparison between centres and it eventually might facilitate the design of multi-institutional prospective and adequately powered randomized trials.

AB  - Abstract Due to its early utilization and increasing ability to provide genetic information, non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) has reinforced social and bioethical quandaries concerning prenatal genetics. This paper presents exploratory findings based on 20 semi-structured interviews conducted in 2017?2019 with Israeli parents of children with Down syndrome (DS), four of whom also serving as representatives of DS organizations. Their views are presented regarding the pros and cons of NIPS; the social context of decision-making about NIPS; and views on life with DS and termination of pregnancies on that ground. While illustrating the large heterogeneity of views concerning NIPS and prenatal diagnosis (PND) amongst parents of children with DS, our respondents commonly criticized the imbalanced information provided by professionals regarding DS, seen as sending a discriminating message in line with the public ignorance surrounding DS. These views are further discussed in the multi-cultural, ableist and pro-natal context of Israeli society. We conclude by offering practical implications concerning NIPS, parental autonomy, and informed choice.
