AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: No previous study compares computed tomography (CT), contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and standing low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LFMRI) to detect lesions in horses with lameness localised to the foot. This study will help clinicians understand the limitations of these techniques. Objectives: To determine if CT, CECT and LFMRI would identify lesions within the distal limb and document discrepancies with lesion distribution and lesion classification. Methods: Lesions in specific structures identified on CT and MR images of feet (31 limbs) from the same horse were reviewed and compared. Distributions of lesions were compared using a Chi-squared test and techniques analysed using the paired marginal homogeneity test for concordance. Results: Lesions of the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) were most common and CT/CECT identified more lesions than LFMRI. Deep digital flexor tendon lesions seen on LFMRI only were frequently distal to the proximal extent of the distal sesamoid and DDFT lesions seen on CT/CECT only were frequently proximal to the distal sesamoid. Lesions identified on LFMRI only were core (23.3%) or splits (43.3%), whereas lesions identified only on CT were abrasions (29.8%), core (15.8%), enlargement (15.8%) or mineralisation (12.3%). Contrast-enhanced CT improved lesion identification at the DDFT insertion compared to CT and resulted in distal sesamoidean impar ligament and collateral sesamoidean ligament vascular enhancement in 75% of cases. Low-field MRI and CT/CECT failed to identify soft tissue mineralisation and bone oedema, respectively. Conclusions and potential relevance: Multiple lesions are detected with CT, CECT and LFMRI but there is variability in lesion detection and classification. LFMRI centred only on the podotrochlear apparatus may fail to identify lesions of the pastern or soft tissue mineralisation. Computed tomography may fail to identify DDFT lesions distal to the proximal border of the distal sesamoid.

AB  - Objectives To perform a preliminary study to assess whether single-agent palliative or adjuvant chemotherapy has an impact on objectively measured physical activity in dogs. Methods Fifteen dogs with neoplasia (treatment group) wore ActiGraph? accelerometers for 5-day periods before, during and after receiving single-agent adjuvant or palliative chemotherapy. Mean 5-day total physical activity and time spent in three different intensities of activity (sedentary, light-moderate and vigorous) before, during and after receiving chemotherapy were compared to a group of 15 healthy dogs (control group). Results were also compared within the treatment group across time. Results Prior to chemotherapy, treated dogs tended to be less active than control dogs. Treatment group dogs were slightly more active at restaging than they were prior to treatment but had similar activity levels to control dogs. Marked effects of chemotherapy on physical activity were not detected. Physical activity was slightly lower in treated dogs during chemotherapy when compared to control dogs but there was a slight increase in physical activity of treated dogs during chemotherapy when compared with pretreatment recordings. There was little change in the mean 5-day total physical activity between treated dogs during chemotherapy and at restaging but a mild decrease in time spent sedentary and increase in time spent in light-moderate activity at this comparison of time points. Clinical Significance Single-agent adjuvant or palliative chemotherapy had minimal impact on physical activity levels in dogs with neoplasia.

AB  - Summary Equine strongyles have been shown to induce alterations in both mesenteric blood flow and also intestinal motility patterns. Both of these pathophysiological events might play a role in the pathogenesis of colic and it is likely that they are interrelated. The prevalence of strongyle-associated colic is difficult to ascertain: non-strangulating infarction is uncommon but many other colic episodes may be induced by strongyle infections. In controlled studies and in clinical accounts worm control programmes have resulted in a reduced prevalence of colic. Current options for adequate control of equine strongyles are: interval anthelmintic treatments; strategic anthelmintic treatments; selective anthelmintic treatments; daily in-feed treatments and pasture hygiene.

AB  - Abstract XXYY syndrome occurs in approximately 1:18,000?1:40,000 males. Although the physical phenotype is similar to 47,XXY (tall stature, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and infertility), XXYY is associated with additional medical problems and more significant neurodevelopmental and psychological features. We report on the results of a cross-sectional, multi-center study of 95 males age 1?55 with XXYY syndrome (mean age 14.9 years), describing diagnosis, physical features, medical problems, medications, and psychological features stratified by age groups. The mean age of diagnosis was 7.7 years. Developmental delays and behavioral problems were the most common primary indication for genetic testing (68.4%). Physical and facial features varied with age, although hypertelorism, clinodactyly, pes planus, and dental problems were common across all age groups. Tall stature was present in adolescents and adults, with a mean adult stature of 192.4 cm (SD 7.5; n?=?22). Common medical problems included allergies and asthma (>50%), congenital heart defects (19.4%), radioulnar synostosis (17.2%), inguinal hernia and/or cryptorchidism (16.1%), and seizures (15%). Medical features in adulthood included hypogonadism (100%), DVT (18.2%), intention tremor (71%) and type II diabetes (18.2%). Brain MRI (n?=?35) showed white matter abnormalities in 45.7% of patients and enlarged ventricles in 22.8%. Neurodevelopmental and psychological difficulties were a significant component of the behavioral phenotype, with developmental delays and learning disabilities universal but variable in severity. Twenty-six percent had full-scale IQs in the range of intellectual disability (MR), and adaptive functioning was significantly impacted with 68% with adaptive composite scores <70. Rates of neurodevelopmental disorders, including ADHD (72.2%), autism spectrum disorders (28.3%), mood disorders (46.8%), and tic disorders (18.9%), were elevated with 55.9% on psychopharmacologic medication overall. Recommendations for evaluation and treatment are summarized. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT The present paper considers naltrexone to treat opioid dependence during pregnancy. The public health problem of opioid dependence and its treatment during pregnancy is reviewed first. Next, the naltrexone and opioid dependence treatment literature is summarized, with overviews of the pre-clinical and clinical research on prenatal naltrexone exposure. Finally, considerations and recommendations for future medication research for the treatment of opioid dependence in pregnant women are provided. The efficacy of long-acting injectable naltrexone relative to placebo, its blockade of opioid agonist euphoric effects, its lack of abuse and tolerance development and its modest adverse effect profile make it a potential medication for opioid-dependent pregnant women. However, it is not without seriously concerning potential drawbacks, including the difficulty surrounding medication induction that may lead to vulnerability with regard to relapse, physical dependence re-establishment, increased risk behaviors, treatment dropout and resulting opioid overdose. Before embarking on future research with this medication, the benefits and risks for the mother?embryo/fetus/child dyad should be weighed carefully. Should future research be conducted, a multi-level commitment to proactive ethical research is needed to reach the ultimate goal of improving the lives of women and children affected by opioid dependence.

AB  - Abstract Background This study was conducted to evaluate the predisposing factors, microbiology, treatment, and outcomes associated with hepatic abscess, a rare but serious complication which may accur after an orthotopic liver transplant (OLT). Methods This was a retrospective study based on a prospectively maintained database of 1100 patients who underwent OLT at the Medical University of Warsaw. An abscess was defined on imaging as solitary or multiple localized parenchymal collections in patients with clinical signs of infection, with or without positive cultures from blood or abscess aspirate. Results Fifteen patients (1.4%) developed hepatic abscess, including 12 (80%) with multiple abscesses. Predisposing factors included biliary pathology (eight patients), hepaticojejunostomy (six patients), and hepatic artery stenosis or thrombosis (five patients). Ten patients were treated using multiple percutaneous and endoscopic interventional procedures in addition to antimicrobial treatment whereas five were treated solely with antibiotics. Five patients (33.3%) died due to multi-organ failure secondary to abscess treatment, including one unsuccessful case of re-OLT. Thirteen patients (87%) had bacterial growth and five (33.3%) had fungal growth in their blood or abscess aspirates. Conclusions Hepatic abscess after liver transplantation may be treated successfully with percutaneous and endoscopic intervention, along with antibiotics according to the results of microbial cultures of blood and/or abscess aspirates.

AB  - Non-traumatic shoulder pain in the overhead athlete is a diagnostic challenge. In the last decade shoulder arthroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have extended our knowledge. Previously unknown pathologic changes in the glenohumeral joint have been demonstrated and it is recognized that impingement symptoms and instability are often related. Shoulder dysfunction in overhead athletes may be caused by shoulder instability. However, a possible instability in the shoulder is often ?silent? and difficult to demonstrate by ordinary tests and has therefore by some been termed ?functional instability?. It is now thought that functional instability in the shoulder may lead to a vicious cycle involving microtraumata and attenuation of the capsular complex, and may eventually lead to shoulder pain. Changes in shoulder proprioception, measured by testing kinaesthetic sense and position sense, can be related to different pathologic changes in the shoulder, and sensory motor control may be an important factor for functional stability in the shoulder. MRI and arthroscopical findings in athletes with shoulder pain are changes in the glenoid labrum, the humeral head, the rotator cuff, biceps tendon and the capsular complex. However, these findings often present other clinical entities than impingement and are not always associated with instability. Clinically, there are tests that can objectively distinguish some of the pathological findings. However, we need more exact methods to further improve our clinical diagnoses of the painful shoulder. One of the keys could be an extended knowledge about the pathophysiology behind functional instability. This review focuses on an improved terminology in impingement based on the current knowledge of impingement and instability in the shoulder.

PY  - 2006
AB  - Abstract Peripartum coronary artery dissection is rare, but it is an increasingly recognized risk to women of childbearing age. Literature reviews reveal that about 80% of the population with spontaneous coronary artery dissections (SCAD) are female, and approximately 25?33% of cases occurred while the woman was pregnant or in the peripartum phase. Most cases have presented within 2 weeks of delivery. The left anterior descending is the most commonly affected vessel. The etiology is poorly understood, but many reports suggest that SCAD occurs as a result of protease release secondary to an eosinophilic vasculitis resulting in vessel lysis. Many investigators have examined the correlation between peripartum SCAD and estrogen levels; however, case studies have shown conflicting results regarding estrogen levels as the putative causative factor. Optimal treatment remains controversial. Presently, stenting appears to be best employed in the patients who have single-vessel dissection not involving the left main coronary artery (LMCA). Surgical revascularization via coronary artery bypass graft remains the optimal therapy in patients whose dissection involves the LMCA, in patients with concurrent multi-vessel dissection, and in patients with disease refractory to medical management. It is important to consider coronary artery dissection in the differential of any young woman who presents with signs or symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndrome, particularly if she is peripartum. Furthermore, once suspected, it is imperative that a definitive diagnostic study, that is, coronary angiography, be completed prior to the initiation of treatment whenever possible.

AB  - BACKGROUND Astronauts on exploration missions may be at risk for traumatic injury and medical conditions that lead to life threatening hemorrhage. Resuscitation protocols are limited by the austere conditions of spaceflight. Solutions may be found in low-resource terrestrial settings. The existing literature on alternative blood product administration and walking blood banks was evaluated for applicability to spaceflight. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A literature review was done using PubMed and Google Scholar. References were crosschecked for additional publications not identified using the initial search terms. Twenty-seven articles were identified, including three controlled trials, six retrospective cohort analyses, 15 reviews, one case report, and two experimental studies. RESULTS Solutions to blood transfusion in austere settings include lyophilized blood products, hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs), and fresh whole blood. Many of these products are investigational. Protocols for walking blood banks include methods for screening and activating donors, transfusion, and monitoring for adverse reactions. Microgravity and mission limitations create additional challenges for transfusion, including baseline physiologic changes, difficulty reconstituting lyophilized products, risk of air emboli during transfusion, equipment constraints, and limited evacuation and surgical options. CONCLUSION Medical planning for space exploration should consider the possibility of acute blood loss. A model for ?floating? blood banks based on terrestrial walking blood bank protocols from austere environments is presented, with suggestions for future development. Constraints on volume, mass, storage, and crew, present challenges to blood transfusion in space and must be weighed against the benefits of expanding medical capabilities.

AB  - Summary A prospective survey of 528 colic horses, referred to the Large Animal Hospital at the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University of Copenhagen, Denmark, during the period August 1994 to December 1998, was undertaken to develop a predictive model for application in the clinical assessment of prognosis. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, 357 colic cases were used in the elaboration of a simple clinical-practical model consisting of degree of pain, packed cell volume, capillary refill time and rectal temperature. The relationship between rectal temperature and outcome (survival/death) has been regarded as linear. It has also been reported to be nonsignificant. The present study suggests a strong U-shaped relation, which is easily transformed into a linear association and readily interpretable in the clinical situation if treated as a deviation from 38Â°C. Several other clinical and laboratory variables were strongly related to outcome in the bivariate analysis. The changes in sensitivity and specificity of the multivariate model, when applied as a prognostic test, were presented with changing cut-off values. The cut-off value is the level, of predicted probability of death, at which the clinical decision to treat or subject to euthanasia is taken. The predictive performance of the model was further illustrated using a mortality of 19%. The optimal accurate classification for both survival and death was 87%, which was attained when a cut-off value of 86% was selected. To minimise the number of horses unnecessarily subjected to euthanasia, the cut-off value was increased. However, this simultaneously increased the number of misclassified survivors, i.e. the number of horses that would die despite treatment. Outcome was especially poorly predicted in 4 horses, as was indicated by extreme deviance residuals. In 2 of these horses the large residuals were attributable to sudden and severe changes in the course of disease. All 4 horses had changes in variable values towards abnormality prior to death. Repeated measurements are therefore suggested in order to increase the test performance in general. The prerequisites of clinical application of prognostic models are critically discussed. The main findings of the present study indicate that degree of pain, packed cell volume, capillary refill time and temperature deviation from 38Â°C, used in a logistic regression model, offer a strong model for clinical assessment of prognosis.

AB  - Granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis, necrotizing meningoencephalitis, and necrotizing leukoencephalitis are common inflammatory conditions of the canine central nervous system. Although each disease has unique histopathological features, these canine disorders collectively seem to be aberrant immune responses directed against the central nervous system. A review of the neurological signs and general neurodiagnostic approach to canine meningoencephalitis is followed by an overview of the specific clinical and neuropathological features of granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis, necrotizing meningoencephalitis, and necrotizing leukoencephalitis. The aetiopathogenesis of each disorder is explored including potential genetic, immunological, and environmental factors along with the current and prospective immunomodulatory therapies for meningoencephalitis.

AB  - Lorazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine that interacts with a high degree of affinity for the GABA receptor complex. This high affinity binding in turn leads to a prolonged duration of action. There are no published clinical studies documenting its duration of action in dogs or its ability to control seizures. The purpose of this study was to compare the duration of seizure control of lorazepam with diazepam in 16 dogs presenting in status epilepticus or with active cluster seizures. Previous seizure history and anticonvulsant therapy was not a consideration for inclusion into this study. Animals were excluded if there was a known metabolic, toxic or traumatic cause of the seizure. Dogs were randomly assigned to receive either lorazepam (0.2?mg/kg IV) or diazepam (0.5?mg/kg IV), and the clinicians were blinded as to which drug they were administering. The duration of the study was 12 hours from the time of drug administration, and the animals were monitored for any indication of seizure activity, including generalized motor activity, focal motor activity (e.g., movement of facial or limb musculature) and change in the level of consciousness. The study ended at 12 hours post-study drug administration or when the dog seized before the end of the 12 hour study period. The results indicated no significant difference between lorazepam versus diazepam with regard to median seizure-free interval (2.8?h for diazepam versus 3.4?h for lorazepam, p=0.58 by log rank test), or with regard to percent seizure-free for the duration of the observation period (1/8 for lorazepam versus 3/8 for diazepam, p=0.51 by Fisher's exact test). There was also no difference between the 2 drugs regarding the number of animals in which seizures were initially controlled (6/8 in each group). Lorazepam used at this dose does not appear to result in a significant increase in duration of seizure control for dogs with status epilepticus and cluster seizures. Additional studies may be warranted using higher doses of lorazepam.

AB  - Abstract Among various classes of biomaterials, the majority of non-centrosymmetric crystalline materials exhibit piezoelectric properties, i.e., the accumulation of charge in response to applied mechanical stress or deformation. Due to the growing interest in nanomaterials, piezoelectric nano-biomaterials have been widely investigated, leading to remarkable advancements throughout the last two decades. Piezoelectric properties, high surface energy, targeting properties, and intricate cell?material interactions render piezoelectric nanomaterials highly attractive for application in therapeutics as well as regenerative medicine. Herein, the major focus is to highlight the wide range of applications of piezoelectric nano-biomaterials in drug delivery, theranostics, and tissue regeneration. After a brief introduction to piezoelectricity, an overview is provided on the major classes of piezoelectric biomaterials as well as a description of the origin of biopiezoelectricity in different tissues and macromolecules. Subsequently, relevant properties and postfabrication strategies of nanostructured piezoelectric biomaterials are discussed aiming to maximize piezoresponse. Finally, recent studies on nano- piezoceramics and piezopolymers are presented, with specific focus on barium titanate, zinc oxide, and polyvinylidene fluoride.

AB  - Abstract:Â  Objectives:? The aim of this study was to analyze short- and long-term results of liver transplantation (LT) in patients over 65?yr. Material and methods:? Between 1996 and 2004, 386 patients underwent 415 LT at our center. The main indication for LT was post-necrotic cirrhosis in 59%, followed by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) over cirrhosis in 33%. Half of the patients (53%) were hepatitis C virus (HCV) +. Overall, 72 patients were >65?yr of age. Actuarial survival, causes of mortality and postoperative complications were compared between groups: patients under and over 65?yr. Risk factors for poor outcome in patients over 65?yr were also analyzed. Results:? The older group had more patients at Child A stage, more HCC as an indication for LT and more HCV (+) patients, p?<?0.05. No differences were observed in donor and surgery characteristics, except for lower multi-transfusion and higher incidence of grafts with steatosis in the older group (p?<?0.05). Actuarial survival at one, three, five and 10 yr was 82%, 75%, 72%, and 70% for the <65?yr group vs. 77%, 66%, 55%, and 55% for the >65?yr group (p?=?0.03). Main causes of mortality in patients >65?yr were recurrence of underlying disease and medical causes. In the older age group, fewer infections (p?=?ns) and rejections (p?=?0.017) occurred in the postoperative period. Risk factor for poor outcome in the group of patients over 65?yr in multivariate analyses was pre-LT renal insufficiency (odds ratio 3.5, p?=?0.002, 95% confidence interval 1.58?7.82). Conclusion:? Results in patients >65?yr are comparable to those <65?yr if older LT candidates are carefully selected. Overimmunosuppression should be avoided in older candidates, as its effects could worsen the pre-existing diseases common in elderly patients.

AB  - Abstract The skin expansion technique is widely used to induce skin growth for large-scale skin deformity reconstruction. However, the capacity for skin expansion is limited and searching for ways to improve the expansion efficiency is a challenge. In this study, we aimed to explore the possible mechanism of skin expansion and to find a potential therapeutic target on promoting skin growth. We conducted weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) of microarray data generated from rat skin expansion and found CCN1 (CYR61) to be the central hub gene related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). CCN1 up-regulation was confirmed in human and rat expanded skin and also in mechanically stretched rat keratinocytes, together with acquired mesenchymal phenotype. After CCN1 stimulation on keratinocytes, cell proliferation was promoted and partial EMT was induced by activating ?-catenin pathway. Treatment of CCN1 protein could significantly increase the flap thickness, improve the blood supply and restore the structure in a rat model of skin expansion, whereas inhibition of CCN1 through shRNA interference could dramatically reduce the efficiency of skin expansion. Our findings demonstrate that CCN1 plays a crucial role in skin expansion and that CCN1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target to promote skin growth and improve the efficiency of skin expansion.
