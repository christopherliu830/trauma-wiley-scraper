AB  - Summary Ascites is the most common complication of cirrhosis resulting in poor quality of life, high risk of development of other complications of cirrhosis, increased morbidity and mortality associated with surgical interventions, and poor long-term outcome. The practical management of ascites involves a proper evaluation of the patient with a thorough history and physical exam. In addition, complete laboratory, ascitic fluid, radiological, endoscopic, and in some cases histological tests should be performed. Taking proper care of patients with ascites can be challenging because they are prone to several complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hypervolemic hyponatremia, hepatic hydrothorax, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and hepatocellular carcinoma, bleeding from esophageal or gastric varices, and hepatic encephalopathy. While the initial management of uncomplicated ascites with low-sodium diet and diuretic treatment is straightforward in the majority of patients, there is a group of patients that fail to respond to diuretics and become a real therapeutic challenge.

AB  - In this article the authors discuss the development, use and auditing of nursing care protocols, which have been implemented and form a guide for nurses caring for patients with fractured neck of femur in Southend Health Care NHS Trust. The development of these protocols occurred after an initial medical audit, which was followed by a far larger multidisciplinary audit, and both of these revealed there was need for changes in the clinical management of such patients; subsequently a large multi disciplinary working group worked together to develop care protocols/pathways to enable closure of the audit loop. The reasons for focusing on fractured neck of femur as a high priority condition are also discussed. All professional groups caring for these patients were involved in the multi disciplinary working group, which was formed to close the audit loop and to improve clinical practices by increasing the systemization and coordination of care. The development of the nursing protocols represented an extremely important part of this process, and the care of about 700 patients was examined during this work. The audit and associated subsequent work have resulted in direct improvements to both patient care and health outcomes, and the authors conclude that there is great value in developing multi disciplinary protocols, particularly those involving nurses, because they spend more time with patients whilst they are in hospital than any other professional group. The benefits of these nursing protocols have been multifold, in particular they have facilitated a clearer flow of patients through the hospital, increased awareness of responsibilities and reduced duplication of effort, and ensured patients receive the best possible care over the 24-hour period.

AB  - Summary This chapter is an overview of basic patient evaluation with an eye to anesthetic planning. Important things to evaluate are the patient's overall health status with a thorough physical examination, temperament, body condition score, cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Basic blood work can include just a Packed Cell Volume (PCV) and Total Protein (TP) in healthy patients who are young with no systemic disease. Other tests will be indicated in patients who are geriatric or who have significant disease. The full gamut of possible tests that can be run are outside of the scope of this chapter.

AB  - Introduction:? In 2001 our Renal Dialysis Unit underwent a major renovation to five stations. The new space and funding allowed for acquisition of new state-of-the-art hemodialysis machines. We describe our experience with the Gambro Phoenix with Diascan and Exalis. Prior to the move an evaluation was undertaken. Criteria for selection with a scoring tool were utilized to rate machine performance for use in children. The decision for the Gambro Phoenix machine was based on: the performance rated highly due to ease of set up; large viewing touch screen; compatibility with existing equipment; benefits of online clearance monitoring (Diascan); network data management system (Exalis) and the future availability of blood volume monitoring (Hemoscan). Our program was the first center to dialyze a pediatric patient on the Phoenix machine in Canada. Patients and results:? 13 patients (age 2?23 years) were hemodialyzed between May 2002 and September 2003 for periods of 2?week to 16 months, greater than 5000?h of dialysis time. The move was not uneventful. During the first months of operation issues such as inadequate electrical supply for the new machines, reverse osmosis (RO) pump failure, leaks, and no emergency power to the RO were prevalent. The new software also exposed glitches. Subsequent Phoenix use proceeded uneventfully. Staff were able to problem solve easily with clinical and technical support from Gambro Canada. Education for the online clearance monitoring, Diascan and Exalis, was necessary. No major problems with dialysis were encountered. The benefits and reliability of Diascan have been previously described (Lindsay RM, Sternby J, Semin Dial. 2001; 14:300). Diascan readings provided real-time measurement of sodium (Na), which correlated well with laboratory values. Automatic readouts of Kt/V allowed for monitoring of dialysis adequacy which was consistent with calculated percent reduction in urea (PRU). At this point, use of the Phoenix has been demonstrated to work well in a pediatric facility.

AB  - Abstract Denaturing CE (DCE) is a powerful tool for analysis of DNA variation. The development of commercial multi-CE instruments allows large-scale studies of DNA variation (many samples and many fragments). However, the cost of consumables like capillary arrays and sieving matrix might limit the use of DCE in such studies. Thus, we have tested 72?different in-house formulated sieving matrices' ability to suppress EOF and separate PCR-amplified alleles with the DCE variant, cycling temperature CE (CTCE). The data herein demonstrate that alleles can be baseline-separated by use of PVP and poly(N,N-dimethyl acrylamide) polymers at various percentages and pH. Allele separation by CTCE is matrix-independent and consequently applicable to any capillary instrument used for DNA separation. Formulation of sieving matrix for CTCE was done by dissolving appropriate amount of polymer powder into the running buffers. Allele separation was observed at different pH (7.5?8.5), concentrations and molecular size of the polymer, without compromising the separation and reproducibility. Finally, the cost reduction of homemade matrices is more than 1000-fold as compared to commercial sieving matrices.

AB  - K/DOQI has set the national standard of adequacy in dialysis. Clinical practice assesses these standards using ?routine? blood work schedules that vary from every 4?6 weeks and calculates these results using different urea kinetic formulas. This variance may result in under-dialysis of our patients that may not be detected until the next routine blood work. Comparing Kt/V blood work results using ?snapshot? laboratory results versus total run trending using Integra Diascan monitoring may help us define adequacy and may identify potential cost savings to the medical system and the hemodialysis patient. Diascan offers more than on-line Kt/V monitoring of clearances; it also reports patient serum plasma conductivity. Serum plasma monitoring helps to identify potential excess fluid gains which may compromise dialysis treatments leading to poor clearances, which in turn leads to increased morbidity and mortality, as well as increasing costly dialysis interventions and potential emergent treatments. The small sampling of patients compared use a variety of vascular accesses and were examined for some of the barriers to effective ?snapshot? monitoring of Kt/V or PRU versus trending adequacy to explore the potential benefits and efficacy of the data obtained.

AB  - Summary Symptomatic acute adrenal insufficiency (adrenal crisis) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and should be managed as a medical emergency. Adrenal crisis is brought about by lack of production of the adrenal hormone cortisol and/or mineralocorticoids. It presents with marked symptoms and signs, characteristic laboratory abnormalities, and requires immediate treatment. The severity of this condition is related to the central role of these hormones in energy, salt, and fluid homeostasis. There are two forms of adrenal insufficiency: primary and secondary. Primary adrenal insufficiency (also termed Addison's disease), is caused by the inability of the adrenal cortex to produce sufficient amounts of glucocorticoids and/or mineralocorticoids (e.g., due to autoimmune-mediated destruction of adrenocortical tissue). Secondary adrenal insufficiency (also termed central hypoadrenalism) results when adrenal glucocorticoid production is deficient or absent because of corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]) deficiency. Chronic care of primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency is also briefly described; as this is an important opportunity to reduce future admissions, improve quality of life, and decrease morbidity.

AB  - While severe nephrotoxicity is uncommon during gold therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the prevalence of mild nephrotoxicity has not been investigated. To study this, levels of leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) and N-acetyl-?-glucosaminidase (NAG) (nmole/hr/mg urinary creatinine), and ?2microglobulin (?2M) (?g/mg urinary creatinine) were measured in urine samples from 33 patients with RA receiving gold and 28 patients with various musculoskeletal diseases not receiving gold. Each patient had a normal urinalysis and blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine. LAP was above 30 in 55% of RA patients and 7% of controls (p < 0.01). NAG was above 100 in 70% of RA patients and 14% of controls (p < 0.01). In 8 RA patients, NAG was over 200; LAP was over 100 in 4, but in none of the controls. ?2M was above 0.32 in 7 of 23 female RA patients and in none of 12 female controls (p = 0.012) and none of the male patients. Patients who excreted high levels of ?2M also excreted high levels of NAG and LAP. These data show that gold in therapeutic doses affects renal tubular cells, causing the release of NAG and LAP from lysosomes and brush borders of the cells. This may represent the mildest stage of nephrotoxicity. Elevated ?2M in the urine of some patients indicate a degree of nephrotoxicity sufficient to cause renal tubular dysfunction.

AB  - The Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH) has dialyzed >320 patients with ESRD since 1993. Objective:? To identify differences, and their causes, in the practice of dialysis between Nigerian state-owned dialysis units and U.S.A. Methods:? We analyzed the characteristics of chronic dialysis at JUTH. Results:? At JUTH, chronic dialysis is started at development of frank uremia (K/DOQI standard: creatinine clearance >10?mL/min, no overt uremia). Frequency of hemodialysis was 3 times weekly in 2 patients, twice weekly in 1 and once weekly or longer in 7 patients. Breakdowns in the dialysis machinery, which is outdated, forced additional decreases in the frequency of dialysis. Duration of a dialysis session was 4?h by prescription, but much longer in several sessions because of dialysis machine breakdown during the session (US standard: 4?h). 2 patients were dialyzed through arterio-venous fistulas and 8 patients were dialyzed though temporary femoral vein dialysis catheters removed after each dialysis session. A vascular surgeon was unavailable. The urea reduction ratio was 45.38.6% (U.S.A target: 65%). The cost of the first dialysis session at JUTH is $160. With reuse of dialysis supplies, including dialyzers, dialysis tubing, femoral catheters, and guide wires, the cost of each subsequent dialysis session is $33. The minimal cost of dialysis with 3 dialysis sessions weekly and a new dialyzer every week is $501 per month. The cost of dialysis is borne exclusively by the patient. For comparison, average monthly income is $74 for unskilled laborers, $222 for dialysis technicians, $296 for dialysis nurses, and $889 for academic nephrologists. The low dose of dialysis has adverse effects on patient quality of life (frequent admissions with uremia). Despite notable exceptions (2 patients on dialysis for 12 and 9 years, respectively), survival of dialysis patients at JUTH appears to be poor. Conclusions:? Underdialysis is frequent in Nigeria and is the consequence of socioeconomic conditions and technologic deficits. Removal of the economic burden of dialysis from the patients with ESRD is the first logical step toward correction of underdialysis.

AB  - ABSTRACT Renal amyloidosis was diagnosed in six related English foxhounds from two separate hunting kennels. There was no apparent age or sex predilection. All the dogs had clinical and laboratory findings compatible with renal disease. The onset of clinical signs was acute in all cases with death or euthanasia in five of the six affected dogs occurring within one week of presentation. The remaining dog was treated with diuresis which produced a temporary improvement. Histological examination of renal tissue from affected dogs identified the presence of both glomerular and interstitial amyloid, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining to be of the reactive type (amyloid A). There were occasional sclerosed glomeruli or glomeruli with thickened Bowman's capsules, in addition to interstitial and periglomerular infiltration with a predominance of plasma cells and lymphocytes and secondary changes including tubular eosinophilic casts. Renal papillary necrosis was identified in three dogs. One hound had concurrent multicentric lymphoma. Pedigree analysis of the affected dogs revealed that four individuals shared a common great grandsire and that the same dog was the grand-sire of a further case. Pedigree analysis of five additional dogs from one of the kennels, all of which had clinical signs of acute renal failure but from which renal tissue was not available, revealed a close relationship to those foxhounds with confirmed renal amyloidosis.

AB  - Summary The two main causes of peptic ulceration are Helicobacter pylori infection and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin. H. pylori is now becoming less common in developed countries, so the relative contribution of NSAIDs, including low dose aspirin, is increasing. H. pylori - induced ulcers are caused by pathogenic strains of the bacterium infecting genetically susceptible hosts, and such ulcers are more common in smokers. NSAID ulcers are caused by NSAID inhibition of gastro-protective prostaglandins, and some NSAIDs are more ulcerogenic than others. The main symptom of peptic ulceration is epigastric pain, but NSAID ulcers in particular sometimes present atypically, and can be painless. Treatment of ulcers is with acid suppressing drugs, usually proton inhibitors, and treatment of the underlying cause to prevent recurrence. H. pylori can be diagnosed at endoscopy by urease test or by histology, or diagnosed non invasively by urea breath test, by stool antigen test or (less accurately) by serology. H. pylori should be treated in patients presenting with dyspepsia following non-invasive testing, and also when H. pylori-induced ulcers are found at endoscopy. Treatment is with two or more antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor given together for 1-2 weeks, the best regimen differing in different countries and different clinical contexts. Treatment of NSAID ulcers involves stopping the NSAIDs if possible and prescribing proton pump inhibitors. Prevention of NSAID ulcers is important: the least toxic NSAID available should be prescribed and in high risk patients and those with previous ulceration, co-prescription of a proton inhibitor greatly reduces ulcer risk. The most serious complications of peptic ulceration are bleeding and perforation. The former can be treated endoscopically and then with powerful acid suppressants; surgery is rarely required. The latter is treated by a simple surgical oversew and treatment or removal of the cause.

AB  - Summary This chapter presents the background, challenges, strategic mapping, high-risk markers, high-risk predictors, investigations, smart testing, management, comprehensive management and preferential management for ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The signs suggesting extensive myocardial injuries include high white blood cell count and elevated brain natriuretic peptide level (BNP). Chest pain may radiate to the left arm, neck, jaw, back or to the epigastric area. Many patients complain of chest tightness rather than chest pain. Some patients, especially the elderly, and women may present with acute shortness of breath, dizziness, pre-syncope, or syncope, nausea and vomiting, rather than classical angina. In the acute setting of STEMI, only the electrocardiogram (ECG), and basic blood tests of complete blood count and electrolytes (sodium, potassium), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine level, protime and prothrombin time are needed before the patient receives thrombolytic therapy or undergoes urgent coronary angiogram for possible angioplasty.

AB  - Summary Burns and dog-bite wounds can be superficial or extensive, involving muscle, bone, and vital organs. Bullet wounds may penetrate deeper tissues causing injury far from the point of entry. Burns that cover a large surface area result in substantial losses of fluids and electrolytes. Medications applied topically to burns should be easy to apply and should not interfere with healing. Horses that have incurred a bullet wound may require antimicrobial therapy, due to the penetration of a viscus, or a synovial structure. The bullet injures tissues directly in its path, and concussive forces injure tissue adjacent to the bullet's path. Dog-bite wounds are heavily contaminated and characterized by the presence of crushed, necrotic tissue. Damage to tissue caused by a bullet, a bite, or a burn progresses after injury, necessitating continuous re-evaluation of the wound.

Results The SPAS was placed 1?cm caudal to the umbilicus. The procedure was completed with the SPAS alone in two cases. An additional cannula was added in 12 cases. In the last 10 cases, the additional cannula was placed at the beginning of the procedure. Dissection began at the cystic duct in 11 dogs (73%). In three cases (20%), the SPAS procedure was converted to a laparotomy; two of these conversions were elective, and one was emergent. The risk of conversion was affected by the experience of the surgeon (odds ratio = 0.53; P = .0105), and the rate of conversion was reduced when a cannula was added at the beginning of the procedure (P = .022). Fourteen dogs were discharged from the hospital. One dog died after being discharged due to severe cholangiohepatitis, and another dog died due to leakage of a gastrostomy tube. Conclusions The use of SPAS for cholecystectomy in dogs has an acceptable outcome. The experience gained by the surgeon and the addition of a cannula reduced the risk of conversion. Clinical Relevance/Impact Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed with a SPAS. The placement of an additional cannula at the beginning of the procedure is highly recommended.

AB  - Abstract A 37-year-old male presented with a cauliflower-like tumor in the right buccal mucosa, leukoplakia of the tongue and esophagus, and keratotic papules or plaques on the extremities including bilateral palms and soles, associated with borderline diabetes mellitus and a repeated history of infections. A multi-system keratinizing abnormality was suspected, although no distinct disease category has been found showing similar involvements.
