AB  - Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) produces a rapid and excessive elevation in extracellular glutamate that induces excitotoxic brain cell death. The peptide neurotransmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) is reported to suppress neurotransmitter release through selective activation of presynaptic group?II metabotropic glutamate receptors. Therefore, strategies to elevate levels of NAAG following brain injury could reduce excessive glutamate release associated with TBI. We hypothesized that the NAAG peptidase inhibitor, ZJ-43 would elevate extracellular NAAG levels and reduce extracellular levels of amino acid neurotransmitters following TBI by a group?II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-mediated mechanism. Dialysate levels of NAAG, glutamate, aspartate and GABA from the dorsal hippocampus were elevated after TBI as measured by in vivo microdialysis. Dialysate levels of NAAG were higher and remained elevated in the ZJ-43 treated group (50?mg/kg, i.p.) compared with control. ZJ-43 treatment also reduced the rise of dialysate glutamate, aspartate, and GABA levels. Co-administration of the group?II mGluR antagonist, LY341495 (1?mg/kg, i.p.) partially blocked the effects of ZJ-43 on dialysate glutamate and GABA, suggesting that NAAG effects are mediated through mGluR activation. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that inhibition of NAAG peptidase may reduce excitotoxic events associated with TBI.

AB  - Summary The prevalence of underlying renal disease in pregnancy is estimated to be as high as 3%. Adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes including preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, and perinatal death are increased. Although data are limited, current evidence indicates that pre-pregnancy or early pregnancy serum creatinine is the best predictor of pregnancy outcomes. Outcomes are progressively worse with higher stages of chronic kidney disease. A multi-disciplinary team approach is recommended to optimize the well-being of both patients: the mother and her fetus. Pregnancies complicated by dialysis and renal transplant warrant special considerations. Effective contraception and evidence-based preconception counseling are important.

AB  - The editors of Academic Emergency Medicine are pleased and privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, May 16?19, 2007, in Chicago. The exciting trends of emergency medicine research are reflected in these brief summaries as are the talent, creativity, and enthusiasm of novice as well as more experienced academicians. This year, 1,172 research abstracts were submitted and 545 were selected for presentation at the Meeting (not including the 78 Innovations in Emergency Medicine Education Exhibits, which were submitted sepa-rately). Each abstract was independently reviewed by up to six designated topics experts who were blinded to the authors. Final determination for scientific presentation was made by the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by O. John Ma, MD, and the SAEM Program Committee, chaired by Debra Houry, MD, MPH. The decision for presentation was based on the final review score and the space available for presentation at the meeting. We present these abstracts as they were received electronically from the authors, who are solely responsible for their content. They appear as they were received; we have done only minimal proofreading of these abstracts. Any questions you may have on their content should be directed to their authors. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. An index of key words and authors begins on page S220. Abstracts marked as late breakers (numbers 462 and 527) are prospective research projects, such as a clinical trial still in the midst of data collection or patient enrollment at the January 8 abstract deadline, but that will be completed, including analysis, by April 15, 2007. On behalf of the membership of SAEM, the editorial board of AEM, and the leadership of our specialty, we express our sincere gratitude to these academicians and the SAEM Program Committee for their continuing efforts to improve our patients' care by advancing emergency medicine research and education.

PY  - 1997
AB  - Abstract Autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) is the most common form of prelingual inherited hearing impairment. A small consanguineous family with this disorder was ascertained through the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences in Madras, India. Conditions such as rubella, prematurity, drug use during pregnancy, perinatal trauma, and meningitis were eliminated by history. Audiometry was performed to confirm severe-to-profound hearing impairment in affected persons. After excluding linkage to known DFNB genes, two genomic DNA pools, one from the affected persons and the other from their non-affected siblings and the parents, were used to screen 165 polymorphic markers evenly spaced across the autosomal human genome. Two regions showing homozygosity-by-descent in the affected siblings were identified on chromosomes 3q21.3-q25.2 and 19p13.3-p13.1, identifying one (or possibly both) as the site of a novel ARNSHL gene.

AB  - Abstract The versatile electrospinning technique is recognized as an efficient strategy to deliver active pharmaceutical ingredients and has gained tremendous progress in drug delivery, tissue engineering, cancer therapy, and disease diagnosis. Numerous drug delivery systems fabricated through electrospinning regarding the carrier compositions, drug incorporation techniques, release kinetics, and the subsequent therapeutic efficacy are presented herein. Targeting for distinct applications, the composition of drug carriers vary from natural/synthetic polymers/blends, inorganic materials, and even hybrids. Various drug incorporation approaches through electrospinning are thoroughly discussed with respect to the principles, benefits, and limitations. To meet the various requirements in actual sophisticated in vivo environments and to overcome the limitations of a single carrier system, feasible combinations of multiple drug-inclusion processes via electrospinning could be employed to achieve programmed, multi-staged, or stimuli-triggered release of multiple drugs. The therapeutic efficacy of the designed electrospun drug-eluting systems is further verified in multiple biomedical applications and is comprehensively overviewed, demonstrating promising potential to address a variety of clinical challenges.

AB  - The mortality and morbidity of hemodialysis patients is, to a large extent, determined by demographics and by existing comorbidities, but it is obvious that variations in dialysis dose have substantial effects. Using eKt/V, 1.2 monthly comparisons are recommended by European guidelines, but they assume that dose is maintained during all monthly sessions. Because of dialysis-related problems like hypotension, reduction of blood flow, dialysis time, microclotting of the dialyzer, and vascular access problems, the delivered dose may vary from session to session. New developed devices based on online conductivity clearance reflect the electrolyte clearance and, thus, clearance of urea. The aim of this prospective study was to show the variability of dialysis dose. 24 anuric patients were studied during 3 months: 20.8% were diabetics, mean age 64.7?Â±?18.2 years; 16% females. Access blood were AVFi and the effective dialyzed blood flow was set at 350?mL/min, with recirculation <5%. BMI was 25.4?Â±?3.8?kg/m2 and body weight was 69.7?Â±?12?kg. All patients were dialyzed thrice weekly (245?Â±?21?min) with dialysis machine 4008H (Fresenius Medical Care) equipped with online conductivity monitor (OCM) and the hollow fiber high-flux polysulfone membrane (HF-80 1.8?m2) and helixone (Fx-60, 1.6?m2). OCM was validated for our population and reported in other abstracts (r2?=?0.96, p?<?0.001). Dialysate flow was maintained at 500?mL/min, with standard dialysate liquid. Each patient was subjected to OCM on regular sessions during 3 months, and blood Kt/V samples were taken on midweek day, once a month. Data were processed and statistically analyzed with SPSS 11.0 software package. Kt/V OCM relation with other baseline characteristics was assessed by using contingency tables, t-tests, analysis of variance, and linear regression, as appropriate. All the tests were performed for a 0.05 significance level. The conductivity-based OCM provides an accurate tool to monitor the dose and control of each hemodialysis session and adds to the efficiency of current dialysis adequacy monitoring. OCM device requires little maintenance, and no extra effort is needed. Monthly Kt/V does not reflect the variability of each session. Further studies are necessary to evaluate its influence on morbidity and mortality. ? Descriptives ?

AB  - Background Childhood risk factors are associated with elevated inflammatory biomarkers in adulthood, but it is unknown whether these risk factors are associated with increased adult levels of the chronic inflammation marker soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR). We aimed to test the hypothesis that childhood exposure to risk factors for adult disease is associated with elevated suPAR in adulthood and to compare suPAR with the oft-reported inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP). Methods Prospective study of a population-representative 1972?1973 birth cohort; the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study observed participants to age 38Â years. Main childhood predictors were poor health, socioeconomic disadvantage, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), low IQ, and poor self-control. Main adult outcomes were adulthood inflammation measured as suPAR and high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP). Results Participants with available plasma samples at age 38 were included (NÂ =Â 837, 50.5% male). suPAR (mean 2.40Â ng/ml; SD 0.91) was positively correlated with hsCRP (r 0.15, pÂ <Â .001). After controlling for sex, body mass index (BMI), and smoking, children who experienced more ACEs, lower IQ, or had poorer self-control showed elevated adult suPAR. When the five childhood risks were aggregated into a Cumulative Childhood Risk index, and controlling for sex, BMI, and smoking, Cumulative Childhood Risk was associated with higher suPAR (b 0.10; SE 0.03; pÂ =Â .002). Cumulative Childhood Risk predicted elevated suPAR, after controlling for hsCRP (b 0.18; SE 0.03; pÂ <Â .001). Conclusions Exposure to more childhood risk factors was associated with higher suPAR levels, independent of CRP. suPAR is a useful addition to studies connecting childhood risk to adult inflammatory burden.

AB  - Abstract Man has used hallucinogenic plants and mushrooms for centuries. The characteristics of these plants that led to their incorporation into important ritualistic and spiritual traditions, however, have also resulted in their widespread propagation and abuse. Hallucinogenic plants have long been depicted as innocuous substances, yet their unpredictable nature makes intoxication potentially dangerous. In present-day society, there is greater access to these drugs and a growing trend among the younger generations to experiment with these plants in a recreational fashion. Emergency physicians need to be aware of the potential sources of plant hallucinogens and the spectrum of toxic effects. A review of the more common hallucinogenic plants and fungi is discussed with reference to historical, pharmacological and clinical aspects of these intoxications.

AB  - Summary Cancer increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The National Institute for Care and Health Excellence (NICE) recommends considering cancer screening in patients with unprovoked VTE. A number of mechanisms have been proposed, including release of inflammatory cytokines and pro-angiogenic factors by an underlying tumour, interaction between tumour cells and vascular endothelium leading to endothelial damage and platelet activation, and mass effect causing impaired venous return. On the basis of this association, it has become controversial as to how far to investigate someone presenting with unprovoked VTE for possible underlying cancer, and whether computerised tomography (CT) screening for occult malignancy in asymptomatic patients is of clinical benefit. The number of equivocal or false positive scans was very different in two influential studies in this area ? the SOMIT study and the Trousseau study. This chapter summarises and discusses these two studies, and a more recent larger randomised trial.

AB  - Abstract It has been hypothesized that transplanting simultaneous pancreas kidney (SPK) grafts from donors with a history of cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CACPR) leads to inferior post-transplant outcomes due to organ hypoperfusion during cardiac arrest and mechanical trauma during resuscitation. Using SRTR data, we identified 13,095 SPK transplants from 2000-2018, of which 810 (6.2%) were from donors with a history of CACPR. After inverse probability of treatment weighting on donor and recipient characteristics, we found that 1-, 5- and 10-year patient (CACPR: 96.4%, 89.9% and 78.9%; non-CACPR: 96.3%, 88.9% and 76.0%; p=0.3), death-censored pancreas graft survival (CACPR: 89.3%, 82.7%, 75.0%; non-CACPR: 89.9%, 82.7%, 76.3%; p=0.7), and death-censored kidney graft survival (CACPR: 97.0%, 89.5%, 78.2%; non-CACPR: 96.9.9%, 88.7%, 80.0%; p=0.4) were comparable between the two groups. There were no differences in the risk of pancreatitis (CACPR: 2.9%, non-CACPR: 2.4%; weighted OR=0.74 1.22 2.02; p=0.4), anastomotic leak (CACPR: 1.6%, non-CACPR: 2.0%; weighted OR=0.54 1.02 1.93; p>0.9), or median length of hospital stay (CACPR: 8 days, non-CACPR: 9 days; p=0.6) for recipients of CACPR vs. non-CACPR donors. Our findings suggest that CACPR donors could be used to expand the SPK donor pool without compromising short or long-term outcomes.

AB  - Summary Pyothorax is the accumulation of exudate within the thoracic cavity. Species of bacteria most commonly associated with pyothorax differ in cats versus dogs. In cats, Pasteurella spp. is by far the predominant species cultured; in dogs, a wider variety of bacteria have been associated with the condition, mainly obligate anaerobes or a mixture of obligate anaerobes with facultative aerobic bacteria. The average age at presentation is between 4 and 5 years for cases of canine and feline pyothorax, although it may occur in all age groups. The most common hematologic and biochemical findings in canine and feline pyothorax are anemia, neutrophilic leucocytosis with a left shift, and hypoalbuminemia. Treatment of pyothorax in cats and dogs can be broadly divided into medical and surgical treatments. Primary medical management using thoracostomy tubes and antimicrobials with or without lavage is still used in the majority of cases successfully.

AB  - Background:? Insulin resistance has been associated with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, central obesity, and dyslipidemia, all of which are important risk factors for progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). A greater degree of insulin resistance may predispose to renal injury by worsening renal hemodynamics through the elevation of glomerular filtration fraction. However, there are sparse data on the relationship between insulin resistance, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and total body fat or phase angle in CKD without diabetes. Methods:?We examined 84 non-diabetes CKD patients according to the K/DOQI definitions; only 79 patients were enrolled into the study (GFR between 15 and 90?ml/min/1.73?m2). The value of insulin resistance was obtained by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). Bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed to determine the percentage of total body fat or phase angle. GFR was calculated by the average of creatinine and urea clearances. Results:?The correlation analysis showed that HOMA-insulin resistance was positively correlated with phase angle (r?=?0.35, P?<?0.01), percentage of total body fat (r?=?0.27, P?<?0.01), body mass index (r?=?0.48, P?<?0.01) and serum triglyceride levels (r?=?0.32, P?<?0.01), but not significantly correlated with gender (r?=??0.07, P?>?0.05), age (r?=?0.05, P?>?0.05), GFR (r?=??0.006, P?>?0.05), and mean arterial blood pressure (r?=?0.11, P?>?0.05). Conclusion:?In non-diabetic chronic kidney disease patients, the major risk factor for insulin resistance is the amount of total body fat. The insulin level is not dependent on the GFR in these patients.

AB  - Abstract Aims To synthesize the evidence evaluating if blood samples are similar when obtained from peripheral intravenous cannula compared with venepuncture. Design A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken. Data sources Searches were conducted in databases for English language studies between January 2000?December 2018. Review methods The search adhered to the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using Joanna Briggs critical appraisal instruments. The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE. Results Sixteen studies were identified. Findings suggest haemolysis rates are higher in blood sampled from peripheral intravenous cannula. However, haemolysis rates may be lower if a peripheral intravenous cannula blood sampling protocol is followed. For equivalence of blood test results, even though some results were outside the laboratory, allowable error and were outside the Bland?Altman Level of Agreement, none of these values would have required clinical intervention. With regard to the contamination rates of blood cultures, the results were equivocal. Conclusion Further research is required to inform the evidence for best practice recommendations, including, if a protocol for drawing blood from a peripheral cannula is of benefit for specific patient populations and in other settings. Impact Venepuncture can provoke pain, anxiety and cause trauma to patients. Guidelines recommend blood samples from peripheral intravenous cannula be taken only on insertion. Anecdotal evidence suggests drawing blood from existing cannulas may be a common practice. Further research is required to resolve this issue.

AB  - A progressive pulmonary disease resulting in severe respiratory failure and death in an average of 3 weeks was diagnosed in 11 young Dalmatian dogs. The dogs were from 4 litters, all genetically related by a common ancestor. The initial clinical signs were tachypnea and noisy respiration. Respiratory distress developed shortly before death and was characterized by strenuous and rapid respirations, along with cyanosis and vomiting. On blood gas analysis, there were severe arterial hypoxemia, hypercapma, and marked alveolar-arterial oxygen difference. Radiographically, a diffuse pattern of alveolar, interstitial, and peribronchial densities was observed in the lungs. Most dogs developed pneumomediastinum and gastroesophageal intussusception in the terminal phase of the disease. There was no response to treatment with antibiotics, corticosteroids, diuretics, or oxygen. At necropsy, the lungs were wet, heavy, and relatively airless. Absence of 1 kidney in 2 dogs and severe internal hydrocephalus in 2 dogs were additional necropsy findings. Pulmonary histopathology included metaplasia and atypia of the alveolar and bronchiolar epithelium, a nonpurulent inflammatory reaction characterized mainly by mononuclear cells and macrophages, eosinophilic hyaline membrane formation, and focal pulmonary fibrosis. The histological manifestations were typical of acute lung injury. Clinically, the findings were consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), except for the relatively long course. No known risk factors for ARDS, such as trauma, toxin exposure, infection, or endotoxemia could be identified. The relationship of the other abnormalities (ie, renal aplasia, hydrocephalus) to the pulmonary disease also remains obscure. An inherited defect is suspected, because segregation analysis of the 4 litters suggests autosomal recessive inheritance.
