AB  - The administration of MPSS is advocated both for limiting spinal cord injury from Hansen Type I intervertebral disk protrusion (T1-IVD) and from the potential surgical trauma associated with laminectomy. Recent studies suggest that treatment with MPSS does not significantly alter functional outcome and is associated with significant complications including gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatic necrosis, and increased rates of infection. The purpose of this prospective study was to report the results of laminectomy without MPSS treatment in non-ambulatory dogs with T1-IVD. The study group involved dogs weighing less than 15?kg that had a laminectomy between T11-T12 and L4-L5 for T1-IVD. Dogs included had not been treated with MPSS, were unable to walk but able to sense ?deep pain?. The dogs were evaluated post-operatively for the ability to walk (stand and advance pelvic limbs), pain (reaction to paraspinal palpation or movement), and incontinence (dribbling urine/feces or failure to completely void urine). Fifty-one dogs met the inclusion criteria. Prior to surgery 0% of the dogs could walk (26 paralyzed, 25 paretic), and 98% were painful. Incontinence was not assessed or was unknown in most cases. Ten days following surgery, 90% were walking, 98% were pain-free, and 82% were fully continent. By 6 weeks, 100% were walking, 6% were painful, and 86% fully continent. By 16 weeks, 96% were pain-free, and 88% were fully continent. These results obtained with laminectomy alone are comparable or superior to reports of those with MPSS administration and suggest that MPSS is not necessary for a successful outcome in dogs receiving laminectomy for T1-IVD.

AB  - Summary Acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding usually presents with haematemesis or melaena, but should be considered in any patient with unexplained hypotension or syncope, or decompensated chronic liver disease. In patients with severe upper GI bleeding, a good outcome requires vigorous resuscitation, and close collaboration with medical, endoscopic, radiological and surgical teams: it is important to involve these specialists as early as possible to discuss the management plan. Urgent endoscopy is needed for patients with shock on admission, with known varices or signs of chronic liver disease, or evidence of continued bleeding. Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy should be stopped/reversed, if the benefits of doing so outweigh the risks: for patients with a mechanical prosthetic heart valve, recent acute coronary syndrome or coronary stents, discuss this with a cardiologist. Patients with low-risk peptic ulcer bleeding based on clinical and endoscopic criteria (e.g. clean ulcer base) can be discharged on the same day as endoscopy.

AB  - Summary Diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for most other geriatric emergencies. Deranged glycaemic control may be the first indication of an infection or other acute illness. The risk of severe hypoglycaemia increases with age, and symptoms may be atypical. Long-acting insulin or oral sulphonylureas can cause persistent hypoglycaemia. Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar syndrome is associated with potentially lethal dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. Complications include infection and thrombosis. Older patients are prone to disorders of thermoregulation due to extreme environmental conditions, medical conditions or medication. Hypothermia can be classified into mild, moderate and severe. Heat illness is less common in temperate climates but older patients are particularly vulnerable during heatwaves and as a result of sun-exposure.

AB  - A three-year-old male neutered domestic shorthair cat was presented for loss of vision associated with hyperthermia, lethargy and anorexia. Ophthalmic examination revealed a bilateral panuveitis. Cytological examination of aqueous and vitreous humours was performed and revealed a suppurative inflammation associated with numerous cocci. Enterococcus faecalis was identified by bacterial culture from aqueous and vitreous humour. No primary infection site was identified. Active uveitis resolved after systemic antibiotic therapy, but the vision loss was permanent. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first reported case of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis secondary to E. faecalis infection in a cat.

AB  - Objective:? The aim of this study is to determine the factors contributing to survival of patients on hemodialysis. Methods: Data were collected from 8 dialysis centers, and 432 patients were recruited. Among them, patients who underwent hemodialysis thrice a week for more than 3 years and received antihypertensive therapy or had systolic blood pressure of more than 160?mm Hg before dialysis secession were selected. Subsequent survival status and cause of death were ascertained for the next 3.5 years. The logistic multivariate regression analysis was used to estimate the relative risk of death. Variables used for the purpose of this analysis were patient gender, age, underlying renal disease (unknown and others (0), CGN (1), DM (2)), medication, serum albumin, history of having cerebrovascular and/or cardiovascular accidents (yes or no), the levels of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, pre- and post-dialysis blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), hemoglobin, serum calcium and inorganic phosphate, ?2-microglobulin, intact PTH, and other laboratory data. Results:?First step logistic regression analysis indicated age, underlying renal diseases, serum creatinine, GOT, ?2-microglobulin were associated with increased relative risk (RR) of dying. According to the formula calculated in this analysis, if the levels of serum creatinine increased 1?mg/dl, the ratio of dying increased by 1.210. Also, compared to the patients aged between 50 to 64 years old, the patients aged between 65 to 90 years old had 1.521 times dying ratio. Conclusions:?From this study, it is suggested that age, creatinine, underlying renal diseases, ?2-microblobulin, past history of cerebrovascular disease, serum creatinine, and GOT were important factors contributing to patients? survival.

AB  - Summary Careful assessment of the biochemistry panel and familiarity with normal biochemistry values for neonatal foals is imperative in the workup of any critically ill neonate, particularly those with neurological signs. The importance of rapidity of change compared to the absolute value of the biochemical abnormality must be emphasised. Serial biochemical panels ideally assist in assessing rapidity of change. Many foals can have severe biochemical derangements in the absence of seizures. Identifying values that are significantly out of range should spur immediate therapy to correct them and potentially additional diagnostic testing to determine the cause of the abnormalities. A temporal relationship between correction of biochemical abnormalities and resolution of seizures and encephalopathic signs supports causation.

AB  - Abstract Introduction and Objectives Prior studies demonstrated that plasma osmolality may have a predictive value for in-hospital mortality in patients with heart failure and acute coronary syndrome. In addition, plasma glucose and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, the components of plasma osmolality, have been shown to be an important contributor for in-hospital mortality in acute pulmonary embolism (APE) patients. Hence, the objective of the current study is to evaluate the effect of plasma osmolality upon admission with in-hospital mortality in patients with APE. Methods A total of 245 consecutive intermediate or high risk APE patients were enrolled into the study. The study population was divided into three tertile groups (T1, T2 and T3) based on the increased plasma osmolality. The in-hospital mortality was the primary end-point. Results After adjusting for all risk factors, in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in the T3 group compared to T1 and T2 groups (OR: 3.6, 95% CI: 1.3 to 18.8, P < .001). In addition, the incidence of asystolia, hypotension and cardiogenic shock were significantly higher in the T3 group. An area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of plasma osmolality for the in-hospital mortality was 0.76 with sensitivity 67.2% and specificity 74.1% 95% CI: (0.66-0.87, P < .001). Conclusion This is the first study to demonstrate that elevated levels of plasma osmolality may have a predictive value for in-hospital mortality in APE patients. Our findings are novel and deserve further studies whether the treatment of higher plasma osmolality may reduce the risk of in-hospital mortality in APE patients.

AB  - Open heart surgery was performed during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to surgically correct subvalvular aortic stenosis in seven dogs. After initiation of total CPB, cardiac arrest was induced by antegrade and retrograde administration of blood cardioplegia. The subvalvular fibrous stenosis was resected through a transverse aortotomy. Intraoperatively and postop-eratively, dobutamine, nitroprusside, lidocaine, blood(-products), and crystalloid solutions were used to manage hypotension and optimize cardiac index. Aortic cross-clamp time varied from 73 to 166 minutes, and duration of CPB varied from 130 to 210 minutes, latrogenic incision into the mitral valve in two dogs was the most significant introperative complication. Postoperative complications included: hypoproteinemia (n = 7), premature ventricular depolarization (n = 6), increased systemic vascular resistance index (n = 5), increased O2 extraction (n = 3), pulmonary edema (n = 2), and decreased cardiac index (n = 1). All seven dogs were discharged alive and in stable condition. Six dogs are alive and in stable condition after a mean follow up of 15.8 months. This is the first detailed report of CPB in a series of clinical veterinary patients. Using the techniques described in this paper, open heart surgery of considerable duration can be performed successfully in dogs with significant myocardial hypertrophy and endomyocardial fibrosis secondary to subvalvular aortic stenosis.

AB  - ABSTRACT Diabetic ketoacidosis is a common medical emergency and may represent up to 14% of all diabetic admissions with an annual incidence of about 4.6 cases per 1,000 diabetics per year. A spectrum of disease is encountered and mortality rates vary in different series from 1.9% to 15%. The pathogenesis of diabetic ketoacidosis is discussed in detail with particular emphasis on interpretation of biochemistry results and on fluid and electrolyte resuscitation. A flexible approach to fluid resuscitation, careful interpretation of biochemistry results, and close monitoring should be combined with other standard aspects of management such as titratable insulin infusions and early treatment of identifiable precipitants in order to minimise morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Introduction: The biochemical consequence of acute obstructive uropathy can alter the hemodynamic profile. The objectives of this study were to determine the arterial blood pressure at presentation of male cats with acute urethral obstruction and to correlate these measurements with concurrent metabolic abnormalities. Study Design: Prospective research study in a private small animal after-hours emergency clinic. The subjects were client owned male cats presented with acute urethral obstruction and no other known concurrent disease. Measurements: Indirect oscillometric blood pressure measurements of urethral obstructed male cats were obtained at admission prior to blood sampling and treatment. Data recorded and studied: mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), physical examination parameters, serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, potassium, phosphorus, total calcium and magnesium concentration, venous pH, electrocardiogram lead II, and urine volume in bladder. Results: Twenty-eight cats were included in the study. Using normal values for MAP in cats, the results fell into 2 groups: normotensive (MAP 90?140?mmHg) and hypertensive (MAP>140?mmHg). Seventy-one percent (20/28) were considered normotensive (mean 113±14.6?mmHg). Twenty-nine percent (8/28) were considered hypertensive (mean 154±9.8?mmHg). In the normotensive group, the mean body temperature was 37.6±1.5°C, the mean heart rate was 179±42.2/min, and 64% (9/20) had an abnormal cardiac rhythm. In the hypertensive group, the mean body temperature was 38.3±0.6°C, the mean heart rate was 219±18.0/min, and all had normal cardiac rhythm. In the normotensive group, the serum biochemical abnormalities were more severe. Sixty percent of the normotensive casts (12/20) were azotemic (BUN>34?mg/dl) with a mean of 114±95.2; 58% (11/19) were hypercreatinemic (>2.2?mg/dl) with a mean of 8.9±7.9, and 55% (11/20) were hyperkalemic (>4.2?mEq/L) (mean 6.2±7.9). Within the hypertensive cats group, 50% (4/8) were mildly azotemic (BUN ? mean 49±24.4?mg/dl); 50% (4/8) were hypercreatinemic (mean 2.9±1.95?mg/dl), and only 1/8 was hyperkalemic (mean 3.9±0.6 mEq/L). The volume of urine in the bladder at the time of presentation did not seem to be significantly different between the 2 groups (94.7±57.1?ml in the normotensive group vs. 83.8±26.7?ml in the hypertensive group). Conclusions: The results suggest that cats with acute urethral obstruction and a normal mean arterial pressure at presentation were more likely to have severe azotemia, hypercreatinemia and hyperkalemia.

AB  - A number of studies in patients and monkeys have suggested that intravenous infusion of lipids can be utilized as a major source of calories during sepsis and/or trauma. Others, however, have observed that lipid calories were not as effective as glucose calories in sparing body protein in severely septic and/or burned patients. In trying to resolve this controversy, a parenteral nutrition model was utilized during pneumococcal sepsis in the rhesus monkey. Earlier studies indicated that when monkeys were infused with 0.55 grams amino acid nitrogen and 13 kilocalories per kilogram per day, they lost approximately 13% of their body protein as a result of the clinical illness associated with pneumococcal sepsis. Addition of 85 kilocalories per kilogram per day of either dextrose or lipid emulsion (Intralipid) effectively prevented this infection-related loss of body protein. The present study was designed to determine whether the elevated plasma insulin concentrations associated with glucose infusions are necessary for protein sparing or would interfere with utilization of lipid calories. In this study, septic and control monkeys were infused with a hypocaloric amino acid-dextrose solution to which was added lipid emulsion. If septic monkeys were totally maintained on a hypocaloric infusion of amino acids and 32 kilocalories per kilogram per day from dextrose, they lost 6.8 ± 1.0% of their body protein over the 6-day experimental period. Addition of lipid calories (55 kilocalories per kilogram per day) to this mixture resulted in a gain of 1.1 ± 0.7% of body protein. In both experimental groups plasma insulin was approximately 100 to 200 microunits per milliliter, which resulted in a marked inhibition of ketogenesis and lipolysis. Despite elevated plasma insulin, the septic monkey appeared able to utilize the fatty acids from the infused lipid effectively as a calorie source to spare body protein. Since lipid emulsion contains approximately 13% glycerol calories, septic monkeys were infused with a hypocaloric amino acid-dextrose solution and an amount of glycerol calories equivalent to that found in Intralipid. Under these conditions, the loss of body protein was very similar to that seen when the hypocaloric amino acid-dextrose solution alone was infused in the septic monkey. Thus, the protein-sparing effects of the lipid emulsion are not related to its glycerol content.

AB  - Case A 65-year-old arteriopath with a history of myocardial infarction 5 months previously presented with classical signs of mesenteric infarction that led to a right hemicolectomy with an end ileostomy. Outcome Postoperative complications occurred due to unusually large volume ileostomy output in the subsequent 4 weeks, resulting in severe volume depletion and the sequelae that required intensive care support. These were triggered and prolonged by two episodes of intra-abdominal sepsis. Conclusions Sepsis-induced high ileostomy output following intestinal resection for non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia is a serious complication. Early restoration of intestinal continuity following bowel resection for established infarction may prevent this complication.

AB  - Urea is still clinically applied as standard marker to quantify dialysis adequacy. The removal of middle molecules has however been proven in some studies to have a long-term effect on mortality. Therefore, the present study is aimed at investigating the impact of blood and dialysate flow, and membrane surface area on middle molecule removal in low flux Fresenius F6HPS dialyzers. Blood and dialysate flows were varied within the clinical range of 300?500?mL/min and 500?800?mL/min, respectively, while ultrafiltration rate was kept constant at 0.1?L/h. Single pass tests were performed in vitro in a single dialyzer (3 tests) and in serially (5 tests) and parallel (3 tests) connected dialyzers. The blood substitution fluid consisted of bicarbonate dialysate in which radioactive labeled vitamin B12 (MW1355) was dissolved. Middle molecule concentrations of samples taken at the inlet and outlet blood line were derived from radioactivity measurements and were applied to calculate the dialyzer clearance as well as the reduction ratio. For the latter, the surrogate middle molecule vitamin B12 was assumed as distributed according to a two-pool kinetic model. Adding a second dialyzer in series or parallel ameliorates significantly overall dialyzer clearance and reduction ratio, except for the highest applied blood flow rate of 500?mL/min. Better solute removal is also obtained with higher dialysate flows, while the use of higher blood flows seemed only advantageous when using a single dialyzer. Analysis of the ultrafiltration profiles in the different configurations illustrated that enhancing the internal filtration rate ameliorates the convective transport of middle molecules. In conclusion, adequate solute removal results from a number of interactions, as there are, blood and dialysate flow rates, membrane surface area, filtration profile, and concentration profiles in the blood and dialysate compartment.

AB  - Summary The aim of wound management is to optimize healing in an effort to return the horse to its previous function as rapidly as possible, while respecting the financial constraints of the owner. Infection, with its associated excessive or inappropriate inflammation, is the single most likely cause of delayed healing of wounds healing by second intention. Effective wound preparation, exploration, cleansing via irrigation, and debridement are central to reducing the incidence of infection and promoting uncomplicated healing of accidental wounds. Antimicrobial drugs should be used only when there is clinical evidence of infection or when development of an infection would be life-threatening or career-ending for the patient. Although empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy may be used initially, definitive selection of antimicrobial drugs should be based on the results of bacterial culture and sensitivity testing of isolates. The use of antimicrobial drugs in surgical wounds should never replace aseptic and atraumatic surgical technique. Where there is evidence of formation of biofilm, repeat debridement and topical administration of antimicrobial drugs should be central to any treatment plan.

AB  - A simple technique for autotransfusion has been developed and used in the successful resuscitation of dogs suffering severe trauma and /or hemorrhage. The purpose of this abstract is three-fold: 1) Describe the criteria used in case selection; 2) Describe the method used; and 3) Describe the results of its use in a limited number of cases. Case Selection: The criteria used were the following: 1. Ongoing significant hemorrhage or severe hemorrhage noted in a body cavity where the blood could be collected; 2. Acute hemorrhage amounts deemed to be life-threatening (>40% calculated blood volume [88?ml/kg]); 3. Where other choices (fresh or stored homologus blood, Oxyglobin) in amounts needed were not possible. Method: Blood was aspirated into a suction canister using a Pool or Yankauer suction tip, with the tip placed under the pool (s) of blood to eliminate as many bubbles in the collection process as possible. If the canister was not sterilized it was scrubbed with a surgical prep solution and then rinsed with tap water prior to blood collection. The blood in the canister was poured into a wide opening in a hanging empty plastic intravenous fluid bag with a blood administration set inserted. The blood was intravenously administered by gravity drip as needed. No attempt was made to use any anticoagulant. Amounts of blood given, clinical responses, and complications were recorded. Results: The procedure was used in 12 dogs: 5 abdominal hemorrhage, 3 thoracic hemorrhage, 2 hemorrhage from both abdomen and chest, 2 vertebral vein hemorrhage. All blood administered was given during the operation or within 2 hours. Amounts transfused ranged from 30 to 120?ml/kg (body weight [mean 48?ml/kg]). No animals died acutely from signs thought to be associated with the transfusion of this blood. Those cases surviving to discharge were 4 abdominal, 2 thoracic, 1 combined, and 1 vertebral vein. There were no infections attributed to the autotransfusion. It is concluded that this technique can be recommended and may be considered life-saving in selected cases.
