AB  - Currently there is no published data using the Cannon catheter. Our purpose was to confirm adequacy of hemodialysis using the Arrow Cannon catheter. This retrospective study used patients from one nephrology practice, utilizing two dialysis centers. All patients in a two year period meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria referred for tunneled catheter placement were included. All catheters were placed by interventional nephrologist using ultrasound for vein cannulation and fluoroscopy for placement confirmation. Pump speed (Qb), venous and arterial pressures, Kt/V, urea reduction ratio (URR), and dialysis prescriptions/adherence to the prescription were reviewed at baseline and monthly for six months. Catheter removal or six months were the study endpoints. Complications were evaluated from time of insertion throughout the study period. 38 patients were enrolled in the study. All patients were treated in the outpatient setting. Insertion outcome was successful in all 38 patients. The average dialysis prescription was approximately 400?ml/min, 3.7 hours, and 3 days a week. The mean average pump speed for all months evaluated exceeded the K/DOQI guideline of 300?ml/min. by 67.9?101.4?ml/min. The differences were significant with p?<?0.01. The mean Kt/V and URR% data for each month evaluated exceeded the K/DOQI guideline values of 1.2 for Kt/V and 63% for URR% by between .34?.24 and 8%?10%, respectively; the differences were all at a significant level with p?<?0.01. Mean arterial pressures for all months evaluated ranged from ?218.6 to ?238.1, and venous pressures averaged between 179.8 to 213.7. Only three patients experienced late complications (all of which were infections) and no patients required hospitalization post complication. Two were bacteremic; the other had tunnel infection without positive blood cultures. This is the first retrospective study to evaluate the adequacy of hemodialysis with the Cannon catheter. Our study showed that flow rates and adequacy of hemodialysis can be reached using the Cannon catheter, with minimal complications.

AB  - We report the diagnosis and follow-up of a septal myocardial abscess in a seven-year-old Anglo-French hound suffering from both renal failure and urinary infection. Serial echocardiography showed the abscess enlarging and progressing into a fistula between the left ventricular outflow tract and the right ventricle. The dog died despite early wide-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy. Post-mortem examination confirmed the diagnosis. Bacterial and fungal myocardial abscesses have been described in immunodeficient human beings. To our knowledge, fistulae have rarely been described in dog hearts and only as a consequence of previous valvular endocarditis. In our case, the sigmoid cusps were not involved, so this is the first description of a septal myocardial abscess in a dog.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Ureteronephrectomy is the most commonly performed surgical procedure of the kidney. It is indicated when one of the kidneys is detrimental to the animal's health whilst the function of the contralateral one is adequate to sustain life. This frequently occurs in cases of advanced hydronephrosis ? usually secondary to obstruction of the ureter or the renal pelvis. Whenever possible the kidney is spared, and alternative procedures are performed to resolve the obstruction. Nephrotomy and pyelotomy are rarely performed, and recently have been associated with or superseded by ureteral stenting. All the latter procedures are technically challenging, and require advanced expertise and facilities.

AB  - Contact lens wear is a popular, convenient and effective method for vision correction. In recent years, contact lens practice has expanded to include new paradigms, including orthokeratology; however, their use is not entirely without risk, as the incidence of infection has consistently been reported to be higher in contact lens wearers. The explanations for this increased susceptibility have largely focused on physical damage, especially to the cornea, due to a combination of hypoxia, mechanical trauma, deposits and solution cytotoxicity, as well as poor compliance with care routines leading to introduction of pathogens into the ocular environment. However, in recent years, with the increasing availability and reduced cost of molecular techniques, the ocular environment has received greater attention with in-depth studies of proteins and other components. Numerous proteins were found to be present in the tears and their functions and interactions indicate that the tears are far more complex than formerly presumed. In addition, the concept of a sterile or limited microbial population on the ocular surface has been challenged by analysis of the microbiome. Ocular microbiome was not considered as one of the key sites for the Human Microbiome Project, as it was thought to be limited compared to other body sites. This was proven to be fallacious, as a wide variety of micro-organisms were identified in the analyses of human tears. Thus, the ocular environment is now recognised to be more complicated and interference with this ecological balance may lead to adverse effects. The use of contact lenses clearly changes the situation at the ocular surface, which may result in consequences which disturb the balance in the healthy eye.

AB  - Background:? Cardiac arrhythmias are considered as one of the most important causes of mortality in patients on hemodialysis. Arrhythmias frequently occur in patients with chronic renal failure on regular hemodialysis with reported incidences varying from 30?48% of patients. These abnormalities can span from supraventricular to severe ventricular arrhythmia. There is an increased frequency of occurrence and clustering of arrhythmias around the dialysis time. Aim of the study:?To detect the difference between acetate and bicarbonate dialysis as regard to the type and frequency of arrhythmia in those patients. Study design:?This study was done on 20 male patients age 51?73, all have history of heart disease. Patients were divided into 2 equal groups using acetate in group 1 and bicarbonate in group 2. All patients were on regular hemodialysis (4 hours, thrice weekly). Careful history and clinical examination were done. Pre-dialysis investigations included serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphorus, serum albumin, hemoglobin, and arterial blood gases. Post-dialysis serum potassium and arterial blood gases were measured. ECG and forty-eight hours ambulatory monitor (Holter monitor)(before, during, and after hemodialysis, till the end of the dialysis day and throughout the following day) were performed. Results:?Group 1 showed significantly less post-dialysis supraventricular arrhythmias than in dialysis day (210.9?±?236 and 62.3?±?14.4), respectively. Significantly less ventricular arrhythmias in post-dialysis than in dialysis day (30.7?±?50.4, and 106.2?±?128.4), respectively. While in Group 2 there were insignificant differences regarding supraventricular arrhythmias (21.9?±?28.9 and 16.6?±?36.3) and ventricular arrhythmias (22.9?+?7.8 and 29.6?+?12.8) in dialysis day than in post-dialysis day. There was significantly higher frequency of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in the dialysis day in acetate hemodialysis in comparison to bicarbonate hemodialysis. Conclusion:?Bicarbonate hemodialysis is less arrhythmogenic in comparison to acetate hemodialysis and has better effect on the blood pH and greater degree of base repletion. Continuous ambulatory ECG recording (Holter) is a useful tool in detecting arrhythmias in dialysis patients.

AB  - Objectives To examine the clinical signs, laboratory findings, possible predisposing factors, antimicrobial sensitivity and outcomes of dogs and cats diagnosed with urinary tract infection caused by Corynebacterium urealyticum. Materials and Methods Retrospective, observational study of dogs and cats that were diagnosed with urinary tract infection caused by C. urealyticum. Results This report concerns a total of 11 dogs and 10 cats. All cats had a history of urethral catheterisation, and six cats had undergone urological surgery before diagnosis of this specific infection. Dogs had history of neurogenic urinary incontinence (n=5), urethral catheterisation (n=4), urological surgery (n=4), lower urinary tract disease (n=2) or prostatic disease (n=1). In seven animals, previous urine culture was negative. Median urine pH was 8.6 (interquartile range 7.5 to 9), and 19 animals had pyuria and struvite crystalluria. Encrusted cystitis was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound in nine animals. All but one isolate were resistant to at least three antimicrobial classes. Thirteen isolates were sensitive to tetracyclines. There was bacterial and clinical resolution of the infection in nine dogs and seven cats. Two animals died from sepsis and two cats were euthanased because of clinical deterioration. Clinical Significance Urinary tract infection caused by C. urealyticum should be suspected in animals with pre-existing urinary disorders, especially if urine is alkaline and there is struvite crystalluria, negative routine urine culture and encrusted cystitis.

AB  - Introduction:? Methanol poisoning can lead to complications that include metabolic acidosis, visual impairment and death. Treatment options include ethanol, fomepizole, and hemodialysis (HD). Objective:?To report on the occurrence of post dialysis methanol rebound during treatment. Method and Findings:?A 40-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia and suicide attempts presented to the emergency room after reportedly ingesting 1 quart of windshield washer fluid. The patient presented with a preliminary blood chemistry of methanol 390?mg/dL, ethanol 48?mg/dL, glucose 93?mg/dL, Na 138?meq/L, K 3.8?meq/L, Cl 98?mmol/L, CO2 26?mmol/L, urea 16?mg/dL, creatinine 1.2?mg/dL, and an anion gap of 14?mmol/L. The patient was started on 1360?mg of fomepizole (12:50 AM) followed by HD for 4 hours. A second dose of fomepizole (900?mg) was administered at 8:00 AM. In addition, another HD session was started at 12:00 PM and continued for 4 hours. A third dose of fomepizole (700?mg) was administered at 8:50 PM. Finally, a third HD session was started the next day at 3:05 PM and lasted 3 hours. Table 1 illustrates methanol levels in relation to each HD session. Findings:?Methanol concentration after the first HD increased from 100?mg/dL to 127?mg/dL (27%) in 5?h 20?m. It also increased from 35?mg/dL to 50?mg/dL (43%) 14?h 45?m after the second HD. Conclusions:?Close attention must be paid to the potential for post dialysis methanol rebound. It is recommended that methanol levels continue to be monitored for several hours after HD. 1 Methanol levels before and after each hemodialysis Start HD #1 ?(2:40 AM) End HD #1 ?(6:40 AM) Start HD#2 ?(12:00 PM) End HD#2 ?(4:00 PM) Next Day ?(6:45 AM) Methanol (mg/dL) 324 100 127 35 50 Rebound 27% 43%

AB  - Charcoal hemoperfusion is an effective treatment in acute drug intoxication with small volume of distribution. For certain drugs, clearance rates are higher with hemoperfusion than hemodialysis. We describe a patient with severe valproic acid overdose who developed severe hemolysis and acute renal failure related to charcoal hemoperfusion treatment. A 50-year-old female was admitted to the hospital following valproic acid overdose. Initial valproic acid level was 73.6?mg/L, and she was treated with oral activated charcoal. Four hours later she developed mental status changes with valproic acid level at 490.9?mg/L and prolonged QT interval. Charcoal hemoperfusion was started with blood flow rate 400?ml/min. Patient developed bleeding with evidence of severe Before(*C.H.) After (C.H.)

(Charcoal Hemoperfusion) Blood ? evidence of massive hemolysis intra-vascular hemolysis, shown in table (no evidence of HUS/TTP). She received transfusion of packed red blood cells, platelets, and fibrin. Over the next few days she developed oligouric acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis for 2 weeks. Eventually hemolysis resolved and the renal function improved (kidney biopsy was consistent with acute tubular necrosis). To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of severe intravascular hemolysis occurring during the charcoal hemoperfusion treatment. Etiology includes mechanical trauma to the red cells, probably related to high blood flow rate through the charcoal column.

AB  - Background Reye's syndrome (RS) is a rare but severe acute life-threating disease characterized by encephalopathy and fatty liver damage. Reye's syndrome is most common in children and rarely occurs in adults. Case presentation A 56-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with disturbance of consciousness and respiratory failure. She had taken ibuprofen for headache. Her Glasgow Coma Scale score was E3V3M5 on admission. The laboratory findings revealed acute liver failure with prothrombin time ? international normalized ratio of 3.16, aspartate aminotransferase 12,548 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 5,725 IU/L, and blood ammonia 102 ?g/dL. Head magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintense signals on diffusion-weighed images of globus pallidus. We diagnosed the patient with RS induced by influenza A and use of ibuprofen. The patient received supportive care in the intensive care unit and her clinical outcome was favorable. Conclusion Ibuprofen might be a risk factor for RS.

AB  - Baclofen, a GABA agonist, is frequently used to treat muscle spasticity due to spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. Baclofen overdose can lead to coma, respiratory depression, hyporeflexia, and flaccidity. Because baclofen is primarily excreted unchanged through the kidneys, it should be given with caution, and it may be necessary to reduce the dosage.Signs of overdose may appear suddenly or insidiously. Acute massive overdose may present as coma. Less sudden and/or less severe forms of overdose may present with signs of CNS depression, excessive salivation, dizziness, nausea and/or vomiting, somnolence, and hypotonia. Should overdose appear likely, the patient should be taken immediately to a hospital. A 46-year-old man, who was treated by intermittent hemodialysis (three times a week), was admitted to our unit for signs of CNS depression, dizziness, vomiting, somnolence, and hypotonia. He was treated at the relatively low dose of baclofen, 5?mg/day, because of muscle spasticity due to spinal cord injury. His temperature was 37?°C, and predialysis laboratory data were hemoglobin 11.4?g/dl, white blood cells 6550/mm3 with normal differential count, and platelets 330000/mm3. Serum sodium was 134?mmol/l, potassium 6.4?mmom/l, bicarbonate 18.3?mmol/l, urea 30?mmol/l, creatinine 998??mol/l, glucose 5.16?mmol/l, and calcium level 2.4?mmol/l. Serum transaminases were normal. A brain computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no abnormalities. Baclofen-associated encephalopathy was considered to be the most likely etiology for this acute neurological picture. Baclofen was then stopped. Plasma concentration of baclofen was >600?ng/ml (therapeutic range 80?400?ng/ml) after 2 hours of hemodialysis and the baclofen level rapidly fell (<200?ng/ml) at the end of the hemodialysis session. After the first 4-h haemodialysis session, there was an incomplete recovery of the neurological status. After a renewed hemodialysis session the symptoms completely receded.The patient was discharged from the hospital 72?h later in a good condition. Patients with severely impaired renal function generally develop baclofen intoxication soon after the initiation of low-dose therapy. Thus, the administration of baclofen, regardless of the dosage, in these patients is not appropriate.

AB  - Objectives: To report the clinicopathological findings and outcome in cats with pancreatitis-associated extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction (EHBO) treated by choledochal tube stenting. Methods: Medical records of cats with EHBO secondary to pancreatitis that underwent choledochal stenting were reviewed. Information on outcome was obtained by re-examination of the cat or by telephone interview with the owners. Results: All cats had pancreatitis confirmed by histopathological examination of biopsy samples (n=6) or suspected based on gross examination at surgery (n=1). In six cats, a section of 3·5 to five French gauge red rubber catheter and in one cat a section of 22?G intravenous catheter were used as a choledochal stent. Two cats developed re-obstruction of the biliary tract within a week of the original surgery. One cat had confirmed episodes of ascending cholangitis postoperatively. Two cats had chronic intermittent vomiting in the postoperative period. Two cats died during the perioperative period. Five cats survived to discharge, three of which died seven to 24 months postoperatively and two of which remain alive to date. Clinical Significance: Choledochal stenting is an alternative to biliary diversion for management of feline pancreatitis-associated EHBO in select cases. However, there may be greater morbidity with this technique in cats compared with dogs.

AB  - Abstract Colon cancer is one of the most common malignancies among populations in the United States and Western Europe, and one of the leading causes of worldwide morbidity and mortality due to cancer. The early detection of colon cancer is central to the effective treatment of this disease and early detection markers are needed. We have demonstrated that high-resolution two-dimensional gel analysis of nuclear matrix proteins (NMPs) demonstrated a specific oncological fingerprint of colon cancer. Utilizing this approach, four proteins specific for colon cancer was identified. Additionally, one protein was expressed much more strongly in colon cancer compared to adjacent and normal donor tissue. The amino acid composition of this protein revealed sequence similarity with calreticulin. The multi-functional protein, calreticulin, is normally found in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum although some reports have described a nuclear localization of the protein. The aim of this study was to confirm the identity of the protein as calreticulin as well as to evaluate the localization of calreticulin in the nuclear matrix of colon cancer tissue. J. Cell.

AB  - Objective:? Dialysis adequacy indexed by Kt/V in hemodialysis (HD) patients is recommended as a single pool Kt/V at least 1.2 per session thrice weekly. But many patients cannot achieve this adequacy target. Although dialysis time is the most important factor influencing Kt/V, it is difficult to prolong dialysis time in practice because of its economic impact and poor patient compliance. This study was performed to investigate the effect of increasing dialysis needle size on dialysis adequacy in HD patients. Methods:?This study enrolled 73 patients receiving HD thrice weekly for more than 3 months with arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or graft in a single center. Dialysis blood flow rate was 200?ml/min in 12 patients, 250?ml/min in 32 patients, and 300?ml/min in 29 patients. Surface area of dialyzer was 1.2?m2 in 56 patients and 1.6?m2 in 17 patients. We first performed HD using a 16-gauge needle. Then we increased needle size up to 15-gauge without change of any other dialysis conditions such as blood and dialysate flow rates, dialysis time, or distance between needle insertion sites. We compared compression time after removing the needles, venous dialysis pressure (VDP), Kt/V, and urea reduction ratio (URR) between these two methods. Results:?The mean age was 54?±?13 years and the number of patients with diabetes mellitus was 27 (37%). Fifty-eight patients (79.5%) have native AVF. Mean Kt/V at HD method using a 15-gauge needle was higher than at HD method using a 16-gauge needle (1.30?±?0.18 vs. 1.23?± 0.18, p?<?0.001). URR at HD method using a 15-gauge needle was also higher than at HD method using a 16-gauge needle. In contrast, VDP at HD method using a 15-gauge needle was lower than at HD method using a 16-gauge needle (88?±?22?mmHg vs. 118?±?28?mmHg, p?<?0.001). There was no difference in compression time between the two methods. Conclusion:?This study suggests that increasing dialysis needle size is a safe and effective method in improving dialysis adequacy without increasing blood flow rate or dialysis time.

AB  - The objective of this study is to report the use of thromboelastography as a diagnostic tool for the hyperfibrinolytic phase of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in a dog with metastatic haemangiosarcoma. We established a cytological (i.e. fine needle aspirate) and histopathological (i.e. excisional surgical biopsy) diagnosis of haemangiosarcoma in a 10-year-old male castrated Bichon Frise with multiple dark purple dermoepidermal nodules on the ventral abdomen and medial stifle areas, multiple small pulmonary nodules and a solitary liver mass. The dog was treated with chemotherapy (AC protocol). Forty-nine days after completion of four treatment cycles, the dog was presented for recheck. Complete blood count revealed anaemia and mild thrombocytopenia. Chemistry profile showed no significant abnormalities. Analysis of haemostasis consisted of prolonged clotting times (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time), mild hypofibrinogenaemia and increased D-dimers. A presumptive diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy was made. A re-calcified thromboelastography was simultaneously done to confirm the coagulopathy. Thromboelastographic tracings correlated with the plasma-based test results showing hypocoagulability (prolonged clotting times and prolonged thromboelastography clot kinetics; weaker clot with decreased fibrinogen levels, platelet count and lower thromboelastography tracing amplitude) and hyperfibrinolysis (increased D-dimers and increased D-dimers and increased thromboelastography lysis parameters). Based on these results, the dog was considered to be in the hyperfibrinolytic phase of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Results of the conventional haemostasis tests supported those obtained on thromboelastography. Humane euthanasia was performed because of poor prognosis and progressive disease, making further follow-up unavailable. As demonstrated in this case report, thromboelastography was found to be a helpful diagnostic tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of the hyperfibrinolytic phases of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.

AB  - Background: Glutamine (GLN) is the primary fuel for rapidly dividing cells, yet it is not a constituent of parenteral nutritional formulas administered to newborns. The aims of this prospective, randomized, double-blind trial were (1) to confirm the safety of glutamine supplementation for premature infants and (2) to examine the effects of glutamine-supplemented parenteral nutrition on length of stay, days on total parenteral nutrition (TPN), days on the ventilator, and other clinical outcomes. Methods: Premature infants received either standard or glutamine-supplemented TPN and were monitored throughout length of stay for various health and biochemical indices. The group was examined as a whole (n = 44; birth weight range: 530 to 1250 g) and in two weight subgroups, <800 and ≥800 g. Results: Serum ammonia, blood urea nitrogen, and glutamate tended to be higher in the GLN groups, but the levels were well within normal limits. In the <800-g cohort (n = 24), glutamine-supplemented infants required fewer days on TPN (13 vs 21 days, p =.02), had a shorter length of time to full feeds (8 vs 14 days, p =.03), and needed less time on the ventilator (38 vs 47 days, p =.04). There was a tendency toward a shorter length of stay in the NICU (73 vs 90 days, NS). These findings were not observed in the infants ≥800 g (n = 20). Conclusions: Glutamine appears to be safe for use in premature infants and seems to be conditionally essential in premature infants with extremely low birth weights. Larger multicenter trials are needed to confirm these observations and further evaluate the efficacy of GLN in these high-risk premature infants.

AB  - It has already been established that the most frequent cause of death in patients (pts) on RDT is cardiovascular. In fact, more than half of the deaths are related to cardiovascular disease. The purpose of the study was to investigate in pts with end-stage renal disease the impact of hypertension on LVMI, a parameter which has already been found increased in early renal disease. Two hundred ninety seven pts (174 male) were included in this study with a mean follow-up of 3 years. Sixty- six percent of these pts (first group) were on antihypertensive agents with one or more (in combination up to 4) drugs. Analytically, as monotherapy or in combination, 29.7% of the pts were taking a ?-blocker, 25.7% an a MEA, 8.9% an angiotensin receptor antagonist, 51.5% a calcium channel blocker, 11.9% a centrally active agent and 1% an α-blocker. Forty-four percent of the pts (secound group) were not on antihypertensive therapy at any time. Left atrial dimension (LAD) less than 3?cm, left venticular volume (LVV) less than 150?ml, and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) less than 130?gm/m2 for male and less than 100?gm/m2 for female pts were considered as normal values. The above parameters were measured using 3D Gen. Electric echocardiograph (Model VIVIO 3). There was no difference between the 2 groups in sex, age, EPO administration, high or low flux filter dialysis, and remaining urine volume. On the other hand, there was a statistically significant correlation between the systolic blood pressure (BP) and the blood urea before dialysis (p?=?0.015) and the increase of body weight in between dialysis (p?=?0.03). Finally, there was no statistical difference between the 2 groups in LAD and LVV, but 37.8% of the hypertensives had higher LVMI as compared with 23.2% of the normotensives (x2?=?3.028, p?<?0.05). In conclusion, mainly the pts who had no compliance with their diet needed antihypertensive treatment. On the other hand, despite the clinically efficient antihypertensive therapy, the LVMI remained high in this group, and possibly this is one of the reasons of higher morbidity and mortality in this category of patients as it has already been shown in pts before starting haemodialysis.

AB  - Summary This chapter summarizes priorities and management of the patient with heart failure (HF) or decompensated chronic HF. Patients with suspected acute HF should have measurement of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP) at presentation. The finding of a normal level of plasma BNP or NT-pro-BNP effectively excludes HF. If the clinical/ECG features or natriuretic peptide level indicate acute HF or decompensated chronic HF, transthoracic echocardiography should be done within 48 hours of admission. HF may be caused by myocardial, valvular or pericardial disease, or metabolic disorders. Clinical assessment, ECG and echocardiography will usually identify the likely diagnosis. Further investigation (e.g. coronary angiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) may be needed for definitive diagnosis. HF due to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is categorized by the LV ejection fraction (EF) as HF with preserved EF, HF with reduced EF, and HF with mid-range EF.
