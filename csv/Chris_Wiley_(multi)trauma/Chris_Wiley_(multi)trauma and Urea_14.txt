AB  - Objectives: 1) Describe the clinical course and diagnostic findings of cats with histopathologic evidence of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 2) Identify risk factors for ALI/ARDS in cats. Animals: Sixty-five client-owned cats with moderate to severe interstitial pneumonia, pneumonitis or alveolitis consistent with ALI/ARDS on post-mortem examination and clinical evidence of respiratory compromise. Procedure: Retrospective evaluation of medical records, postmortem examination and radiographs. Results: Cats in this study tended to be middle aged (mean 6.5±4.9 years). They had a short duration of illness (median 4 days; range 0?120 days) and of dyspnea (median 1 day; range 1?7 days). On presentation, the cats were tachypneic (mean respiratory rate 53±23?bpm) and relatively bradycardic (mean heart rate 166±43?bpm). The majority of cats were dyspneic (n=39) at presentation; all others developed respiratory difficulties during hospitalization. The mean white blood cell count was within normal limits (14.6±14.0?k/?L); 8 cats had a leukocytosis and 7 were leucopenic. Clinical findings consistent with SIRS (n=39) and sepsis (n=10) were common. Thoracic radiographs were reviewed in 31 cats and alveolar disease was the most frequent pattern (105 lung lobes) followed by interstitial disease (86 lung lobes). No cat had normal thoracic radiographs throughout hospitalization. Underlying disease was not identified on post-mortem examination in 15 cats (23%), but in the remaining cats underlying diseases included infectious systemic disease (n=11), neoplasia (n=8), respiratory (n=8) and urinary (n=7) system disorders, acute pancreatitis (n=7), hepatic diseases (n=5), major trauma (n=4), sepsis (n=3), CNS (n=2) and other systems (n=5). Nine cats had more then one underlying process. Conclusions: This study describes a naturally-occurring syndrome of ALI/ARDS in cats analogous to that which occurs in dogs and humans. In cats, ALI/ARDS occurs as a sequela of a variety of underlying systemic diseases, but in approximately one-quarter of patients an underlying cause is not identified at necropsy. It is important to consider ALI/ARDS in systemically ill cats who become dyspneic; in cats with pulmonary disease with acute worsening of respiratory status and in cats with pulmonary infiltrates for which no other cause can be identified.

AB  - Introduction:? Compelling evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO?) plays an important role in wound healing. Not only does it possess cytotoxic properties, but also regulatory functions on various cells involved in inflammation and proliferation. In wounds, inducible NO synthase (iNOS) catalyzes arginine to citrulline and NO?, whereas arginase converts arginine to ornithine and urea. Ornithine is an essential substrate for the synthesis of polyamines, which are important in cellular proliferation and repair. A model for regulation of wound healing proposes the importance of a strict reciprocal control of these enzymes in wounds. Human studies using impaired wound healing models, however, are lacking in this area. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate arginine metabolism in wound fluids of patients with pressure ulcers on Vacuum Assisted Closure (V.A.C.?) therapy. Methods:? Wound fluid extracts from 11 patients with stage III or IV pressure ulcer were analyzed for cytokines and metabolites of arginine. Sample age ranged from 31?92 years. Wound fluid was collected prior to V.A.C.? application and post-V.A.C.? within 24 hours, 3 days, and 7 days. Subjects served as their own control in this quasi-experimental repeated measures design. Spectrophotometric quantification of nitrates and nitrites using the Griess diazotization reaction method was performed. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1?) concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Levels of arginine, citrulline, ornithine, and proline were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Results:? There was no significant differences between pre- and post-V.A.C.? concentrations of NO?, citrulline, ornithine, and proline. However, there was a statistically significant decrease in arginine levels measured at baseline and day'3 of V.A.C.? treatment. Also, NO? measured at 24 hours of V.A.C.? placement decreased significantly at day 7 of therapy. Furthermore, post-V.A.C.? levels of TNF-α decreased significantly from baseline. A less cytotoxic environment is created, thus indicating a healing wound following 1 week of V.A.C.? therapy. Discussion:? Arginine and its metabolites are detectable in wound fluids from patients with pressure ulcers. To our knowledge, the metabolism of arginine has not been described in human subjects with pressure ulcers on V.A.C.? therapy. The determination of NO? in these wound environments provides baseline information on the mechanisms involved in aberrant wound healing.

AB  - A 14-year-old domestic shorthair cat was presented with hypoglycaemia and seizures of several weeks duration. Bloodwork revealed hypoglycaemia (1·83 mmol/l; reference range 4·22-8·05 mmol/l) with concurrent normal insulin levels (171 pmol/l; reference range 72-583 pmol/l). An insulinoma was suspected and medical and dietary management were attempted with minimal success. An exploratory laparotomy was performed and a single, well-defined mass was found within the left lobe of the pancreas. The mass was removed and histologically classified as an islet cell carcinoma, consistent with an insulinoma. The cat had an episode of presumed postoperative pancreatitits, but recovered with appropriate treatment. The cat has had no clinical signs of recurrence of greater than 32 months postsurgery. There are only four cases of insulinoma in cats reported in the literature. All prior insulionomas reported were in older cats and were malignant in character, which is similar to the reports in the dog. This case is unique because of the apparent lack of local recurrence and development of metastatic disease, leading to the prolonged survival.

AB  - The Aksys PHD System, designed to utilize ultrapure dialyzate for quotidian hemodialysis at home, uses mechanical cleaning and hot water sanitization of the blood, dialysate, and water flow-paths from inlet to outlet. Since January 2000, it has been used by 110 US patients and 8 UK patients for a total of 106 patient years and more than 30,000 dialyses runs. Of those treated, 75 patients were male and 43 female; mean age was 52?±?25 (range 22?82) years; 65% were white, 25% black, and 10% other; mean weight was 78?±?20 (44?125)?kg; the cause of renal failure was primary renal disease (50%), hypertension (24%), diabetes (19%), and other (4%). Dialysis access included fistula (61%), graft (25%), and catheter (14%). Patients had been on ESRD therapy on average of 6?±?7 (0?32) years when starting on PHD dialysis. As of August 2004, patients had dialyzed 11?±?8 (1?52) months on the PHD. Of those, 78 patients remained on the PHD, 12 were transplanted, 10 died, 7 returned to conventional dialysis at the end of the original study for the FDA and 7 for medical or social reasons, 2 returned to quotidian dialysis on other equipment, and 2 stopped during home dialysis training. Patients dialyzed an average of 145?±?27?min, 5.6?±?0.6 dialyses/week with a QB of 376?±?45?ml/min and a QD of 545?±?170?ml/min. eKt/V was 0.68?±?0.20 and weekly stdKt/V was 2.61?±?0.52. Mean dialyser reuse was 17?±?14 times without significant decline in urea clearance. 23/118 patients (19%) who came to the PHD from quotidian dialysis on other equipment thought the PHD twice as easy to use and experienced only half as many episodes hypotension, cramps, headache, backache, nausea, and arrhythmias (all p?<?0.02). They were hospitalized only half as many days on the PHD. Cumulative patient survival was 60% at 4 years, with 94 deaths/1,000 patient years, relative risk 0.56 compared with age-matched patients from the USRDS database. Conclusion: This large clinical experience shows the PHD System is easier to use and delivers smoother dialysis with better cardiovascular stability than conventional dialysis machines. It easily fulfills the DOQI guidelines for adequacy of dialysis, economizes on use of dialyzers, tubing, and dialysate, results in less hospitalization, and appears to result in superior patient survival.

AB  - A survey of the nutritional state of surgical patients using haematological and biochemical measurements has demonstrated a higher frequency of abnormal values In patients following major surgery. Anthropometric measurements in patients did not differ from non-hospitalised controls. The routine use of multi-channel biochemical analysis to estimate plasma albumin, and the estimation of haemoglobin levels are of value in the postoperative management of surgical patients. Consideration of early intravenous feeding should be given to those patients who do not make a rapid recovery from major surgery.

AB  - A 20-month-old, female French bulldog was presented with a three-month history of generalised seizures and progressive ataxia with occasional falling over on either side. Neurological examination revealed signs, suggesting a multifocal intracranial lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed two connected lesions on the left side of the caudal brainstem and a further lesion in the cerebrum. The dog was euthanased, and histopathological examination revealed lesions which closely resembled those of necrotising encephalitis in Yorkshire terriers. This is the first case describing this type of necrotising encephalitis in a French bulldog.

Endocrine manifestations of Erdheim?Chester disease (a distinct form of histiocytosis) (Case Report). J Intern Med 1998; 244: 529?35. Erdheim?Chester disease (ECD) is a disorder of unclear aetiology, characterized by exuberant histiocyte proliferation and a variable clinical course. We report the case of a woman with multi-organ involvement secondary to ECD. Central diabetes insipidus (CDI), hyperprolactinaemia, gonadotropin insufficiency and decreased insulin-like growth factor I levels were present, suggesting hypothalamic?pituitary dysfunction. The high-intensity signal of the posterior pituitary on T1-weighted images was absent on magnetic resonance imaging, but no sellar mass lesions or stalk thickening were apparent. Additionally, our patient had bilateral adrenal enlargement. Even though ECD is a rare cause of neuroendocrine dysfunction or adrenal enlargement, it should be considered in patients with these disorders in the setting of multiorgan disease.

AB  - Aims and objectives.? This study explored decision-making experiences of patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease when opting for conservative management of their renal failure. Background.? Dialysis is an invasive treatment, and for some older patients, there is an associated treatment burden of dialysis-related symptoms. An alternative choice is conservative management, but little is known about those who make this decision and how they are supported through the process. Design.? Qualitative practitioner research study. Method.? Data were generated from nine patients? naturally occurring clinic consultations with a renal clinical nurse specialist between May 2010 ? July 2010. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and findings fed back at three multi-disciplinary meetings to check for relevance and resonance. Common themes were identified and codes applied. Results.? Patients reported age and having to travel three times a week to hospital for dialysis as reasons not to opt for treatment. Others felt well without dialysis not wanting to upset the ?status quo? or to burden loved ones. Most felt equipped to make the decision following explanation and discussion with the clinical nurse specialist in the renal clinic. Conclusions.? Patients opting for conservative management give numerous reasons for this including old age, travel limitations, feeling well without dialysis and not wanting to be a burden, but appear content with their decision. One-to-one discussions with the clinical nurse specialist appear helpful during the decision-making process presenting an opportunity for advancing nursing roles in the chronic kidney disease service. Relevance to clinical practice.? Understanding patients? reasons for refusing dialysis assists in supporting until death. There is an opportunity for developing nursing practice to meet the multi-faceted needs of this group.

AB  - Factor XIII (FXIII) is the last enzyme in the clotting cascade. Its main function is to convert the loose fibrin polymer into a firm, cross-linked structure. FXIII inhibitor is a rare condition, in which three different types of inhibitors have been described usually due to IgG antibodies. We describe two male patients with acquired FXIII deficiency (age; 73 and 69?years), who had a history of significant bleeding. Functional assay using the acetic acid/urea clot solubility test showed residual FXIII levels between 1?2%. Molecular studies by PCR and DNA sequencing excluded an inherited FXIII deficiency. In addition, we demonstrated an inhibitor pattern for FXIII by in vitro mixing studies with both purified FXIII (Fibrogammin, Aventis Behring) and cryoprecipitates as sources of FXIII. Transglutaminase assay of FXIII (Dade Behring) was normal for both patients, consistent with a type III FXIII inhibitor, which believed to be directed against the activated FXIII-fibrin complex. Both patients showed transient correction of clot solubility to normal after infusion of high doses of Fibrogammin. In view of previous reports describing FXIII inhibitors of the IgG class, we attempted a novel treatment with rituximab (chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, Roche) to interfere with production of the inhibitor. However, neither patient showed correction of FXIII activity as measured by clot solubility tests during and up to 2 weeks after therapy. Preliminary results suggest that high dose Fibrogammin is required to correct FXIII deficiency due to an acquired type III inhibitor. The role of rituximab or other immunosuppressive therapy requires further investigation.

AB  - For at least 30 years it has been well known that very small electric currents applied to various kinds of trauma have a beneficial therapeutic result for wounds. The most effective methods so far utilized some form of direct current, by inserting an electric lead on each side of the wound and passing a weak electric current across the wound. The drawback of this method is invasive. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a noninvasive electric magnetic field device, Field Therapy Accelerator or FTA (Advatech Corp.), on cell migration of human skin keratinocytes in an in vitro incitional wound model. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes were maintained in growth media and grow into confluent. At time 0, a cross-shaped wound gap or cell-free zone was made among confluent monolayer cells in the center of the culture dish. Cells were treated with FTA for 1 hour immediately after wounding and 1 hour every 24 hours for a total of 4 hours in 4 days. The cell cultures were examined at time 0 and every 24 hours thereafter. A Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope with a digital camera system was used to capture the images and an AxioVision 3.0 image analysis software was used to measure the gap area. Cell migration was quantified by the time and percentage of the wound gap covered by the cells that migrated in and filled the gap. The results showed that the FTA treatment significantly accelerates skin keratinocyte migration. The wound gaps completely filled 6 days after wounding, 3 days earlier than control (no treatment) group (P?<?0.001). Cell migration is a key step leading to the reepithelialization or the restoration of skin structure. This study showed the strong effects of FTA on keratinocyte migration, suggesting one of mechanisms that electric magnetic field works on wound healing.

AB  - Capsicum peppers are widespread both in and out the kitchen. ?Human hand? is a contact dermatitis resulting from the direct handling of peppers. Capsaicin also is found in topical agents for treatment of postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy and arthritis. The oleoresin of capsicum is considered a powerfull irritant capable to induce irritant contact dermatitis and non-immunological contact urticaria. A 81 year-old man with a severe itchy macular and papular rash induced by Capsidol? initially located over the shoulder and sudden spread over the thorax is presented. A dense dermal mononuclear cell infiltrate and spongiosis suggested the diagnosis of contact dermatitis. Negative open tests and a positive patch test reaction (++ 96 hours) using the trade cream Capsidol?(capsaicin 5%) led us to contact with the Pharmaceutical Company Viñas. They provided us the components of the cream: capsaicin, isopropyl myristate, estearic acid (DERVACID 3148), propylene glycol, glycerin monomyristate (ESTOL3650GMM), AMPHISOL K, Cetyl alcohol (NACOL 16?85), benzyl alcohol, diazolidinyl urea (GERMALL II), p-hydroxybenzoate?methylsodium (NIPAGIN M sódic), p-hydroxybenzoate propyl (NIPASOL M). Capsaicin in benzyl alcohol at 0,075% was open tested with negative results. Only patch test with capsaicin was positive (++) at 48/96 hours and the excipient components at the appropiate concentrations were all negative. Patch test biopsy showed an eczematous pattern. Twenty controls showed negative results. This case is probably an allergic reaction but shows how still remains difficult to distinguish among allergic and irritative cutaneous reactions.

AB  - Hypoalbuminemia and decreased colloid osmotic pressure (COP) are common in critically ill dogs. Hypoalbuminemia has been shown to negatively impact outcome. Treatment strategies to raise COP include the use of both natural and synthetic colloids. To date there is no comprehensive evaluation of human albumin (HA) use in dogs. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the use of 25% HA in critically ill dogs. The medical records of all dogs receiving HA between January 2003 and March 2004 were reviewed using a standardized data sheet for signalment, diagnoses, Survival Prediction Index (SPI), dose of HA administered, amount of crystalloid fluid administered prior to HA administration, length of hospitalization (LOH), complications, and outcome. Additionally pre- and post-HA administration values for serum albumin (SA), blood COP, and total solids (TS) were evaluated. Thirty-seven dogs received HA. Thirty of the 37 dogs (81%) underwent surgery and 13 of 37 (39%) dogs were diagnosed with septic peritonitis. Other diagnoses included trauma, wounds, neoplasia, gastric ulcer, and pancreatitis. The median SPI of all dogs was 0.53 (range 0.06?0.82). Median dose of HA used was 1.5?g/kg (range 0.38?3.64?g/kg). Median dose of crystalloid fluids administered prior to HA administration was 6.23?ml/kg/hr (range 1.2?45.4?ml/kg/hr). Median LOH was 5 days (range 1?16 days). Mild complications were encountered in 9 of 37 (24%) dogs and included prolonged clotting times (n=3), increased breathing effort (n=3), vomiting (n=2), and fever (n=1). Of the 37 dogs in the study, 21 (57%) survived, 10 (27%) died, and 6 (16%) were euthanized. After HA administration, median SA increased from 1.5?g/dl (range 1.0?2.1?g/dl) to 2.8?g/dl (range 1.5?4.4?g/dl) (p<0.001), median COP increased from 11?mmHg (range 6.8?13.8?mmHg) to 14.4?mmHg (range 11?26.9?mmHg) (p<0.001), and median TS increased from 2.9?g/dl (range 0.9?4.6?g/dl) to 4.0 (range 2.8?6.2) (p<0.001). When compared to non-survivors, survivors had higher post-HA administration SA (p=0.008), higher net COP increase (p=0.032), and received higher dosages of HA (p=0.046). Pre-treatment SA, COP, or the development of complications during administration did not impact LOH or outcome. In this retrospective study, HA administration effectively increased SA, TS and COP in critically ill dogs and was associated with relatively few complications. Future studies are warranted to further evaluate the potential benefits of HA administration.

AB  - Abstract Accurate assessment of the pregnant patient in the ED depends on knowledge of physiological changes in pregnancy, and how these changes may impact on pathology tests, appearance on point-of-care ultrasound and electrocardiography. In addition the emergency physician needs to be cognisant of disorders that are unique to or more common in pregnancy. Part 1 of this review addresses potential deviations in laboratory investigation reference intervals resulting from physiological alterations in pregnancy, and the important causes of abnormal laboratory results in pregnancy. Part 2 will address the role of point-of-care ultrasound in pregnancy, physiological changes that may affect interpretation of point-of-care ultrasound, physiological changes in electrocardiography, and the safety of radiological procedures in the pregnant patient.

AB  - Abstract To evaluate the effect of donor age on graft and patient outcome after liver transplantation an analysis of a large-scale cohort study was performed at three tertiary referral liver transplant centers. Between April 1990 and June 1994, 772 adults underwent an initial single-organ liver transplantation. The age of the donors averaged 35 years;193 (25%) were 50 or above, the age used to define ?older? donors. Groups were compared for demographic, clinical, and biochemical features. Outcome was measured using results of biochemical tests after transplantation and by graft and patient survival. Compared with younger donors, older donors were more commonly women (59% vs. 33%:P ≤ .001) and died of central nervous system causes (79% vs. 28%) as opposed to trauma (13% vs. 63%:P ≤ .001). The recipients of the two groups of donor livers did not differ in important respects. However, intraoperatively, livers from older donors were more likely to be assessed as either ?poor? or ?fair? as opposed to ?good? (17% vs. 4%:P ≤ .001) by the harvesting surgeon and to have initial ?poor? or ?fair? bile production (29% vs. 18%:P ≤ .001). During the first week postoperatively, the serum aminotransferase and bilirubin levels and prothrombin times were higher in recipients of older than those of younger donor livers. During follow-up, graft survival was less for recipients of older donor livers at 3 months (81% vs.91%:P = .0001) and at 1 (76% vs. 85%:P = .007) and 2 years (71% vs. 80%:P = .005); patient survival showed similar though less marked differences. This association of donor age and poorer graft survival persisted after adjusting for many variables using bivariate and multivariate analyses. Importantly, however, the association with poor graft survival was largely among recipients of older donor livers, the quality of which was assessed as fair or poor by the harvesting surgeon; recipients of older donor livers assessed as good had a retransplant-free survival similar to that of younger donor livers (87% vs. 91% at 3 months). Thus, use of older donor livers, the quality of which are judged to be good by the harvesting surgeon, is not associated with a decrease in patient or graft survival after liver transplantation. differences.

AB  - ABSTRACT A 48 year old man rapidly deteriorated and died following the intentional ingestion of a commercial pesticide mixture containing chlordane and dichloroethyl ether with kerosene as the solvent vehicle. After oral ingestion, chlordane is primarily a neurotoxin. Dichloroethyl ether is a respiratory tract irritant. Both have effects on several other systems. Kerosene is a potent cause of aspiration pneumonitis when inhaled and gastric emptying is not recommended unless it is the vehicle for other, more toxic substances, as in this case. Management for both chlordane and dichloroethyl ether ingestion is supportive, involving airway maintenance, decontamination, and gastric lavage and charcoal administration.

AB  - Increasing number of uremic patients, who need IHD, is a great challenge for every society but especially for poor and developing countries. The aim of our study is to look if small (not very expensive) increase in IHD adequacy is able to improve standard medical parameters. In 40 patients, treated with IHD for 57.5 (1?185) months, Kt/V was monitored on-line during the middle IHD session in the week, 4 times in each of 6 consecutive months. Measurements of Kt/V based on a conductivity method. In the first month of observation Kt/V was lower (1.09?±?0.02, p?<?0.0009) than in later months, in which Kt/V was ranging from 1.13?±?0.04 to 1.17?±?0.01. Blood morphology was estimated every month. At the beginning of study period, after 3 months, and at the end of studies, dry body mass, BMI, the blood pH and serum concentration of calcium, phosphate, intact PTH, total protein, albumin, cholesterol, iron, ferritin, urea, and creatinine were determined. The increase in Kt/V was accompanied by rising values of Hb (99.1?±?16.6 ? 105.1?±?12.5?g/l, p?=?0.022), Hct (31.6?±?5.2 ? 33.8?±?3.6%, p?=?0.004), MCV (95.9?±?7.7 ? 100.7 fl?±?5.7, p?=?0.000), iron (58.2?±?29.6 ? 73.2?±?27.8??g/dl, p?=?0.002), blood pH before (7.26?±?0.04 ? 7.41?±?0.04, p?=?0.000) and after (7.34?±?0.05 ? 7.48?±?0.05, p?=?0.000) IHD session as well as by decreasing values of PTH [918 (38?3500)? 420 (15?4341)?pg/ml, p?=?0.036]. Statistically unchanged parameters included dry body mass (70.4?±?15.6 ? 70.9?±?16.1?kg), BMI (28.21?±?6.73 ? 28.23?±?6.79?kg/m2), serum concentration of total protein (69.1?±?5.7 ? 70.9?±?4.8?g/l), phosphate (5.72?±?1.50 ? 5.39?±?2.02?mg/dl), cholesterol (203?±?49 ? 191?±?62?mg/dl) and ferritin (740?±?558 ? 632?±?346?ng/dl) as well as WBC (8.60?±?3.89 ? 6.52?±?1.50?K/nl) and PLT (251?±?91 ? 195?±?60?K/nl). There were correlations between Kt/V and serum concentrations of phosphate (r?=?0.370, p?=?0.019), PTH (r?=?0.314, p?=?0.048), ferritin (r?=?0.417, p?=?0.007), Hb (r?=??0.376, p?=?0.017), and Hct (r?=?0.374, p?=??0.017). Our results indicate that even a small increase in IHD adequacy leads to beneficial changes in management of uremic patients (better response on erythropoietin, diminished laboratory features of secondary hyperparathyroidism, better iron utilization). Correlation between Kt/V and examined parameters indicate that higher IHD doses were provided to patients in more advanced uremic state. It may partially explain advantages observed with incremental IHD adequacy.

AB  - Abstract Although the medical profession is slowly realizing that many disorders in the aged must be treated differently than in the young, there is still no proper appreciation of these age differences. Too often, when a patient reaches life-expectancy age, the physician relaxes his medical attention. It is assumed that the patient will die soon, although the actuarial statistics may show that he has many more years of life. Accordingly, therapy should be more intensive in order to attain the maximal life span. Elderly people will tolerate many major operations (e.g., herniorrhaphy or thyroidectomy) as well as young people. However, when it comes to serious major operations (e.g., radical neck dissection or radical excision of the rectum for carcinoma), the mortality rate for the aged may be four to eight times higher than for young patients. Elderly patients tolerate emergency major operations and complications very poorly. The chronologic age is not the chief factor in the mortality rate; more important are the operative complications. Therefore, preoperatively, every effort should be made to identify and treat diseases that might cause complications postoperatively. After operation a close watch must be kept for complications so that they may be treated promptly and effectively. Operative technic must be meticulous, with no excessive trauma and with particular attention to hemostasis and wound closure. The operation should be completed in the shortest possible time consistent with safety. A summary of 6 reports in the medical literature shows an operative mortality rate for major operations of 2.6 per cent in patients under 60, compared to 7.2 per cent for patients over 60. The mortality rate for emergency operations is much higher than for elective operations?18.5 per cent versus 6.5 per cent, respectively. A summary of 4 reports shows that cardiac complications were the greatest single cause of postoperative mortality (21.6 per cent), with pneumonia and atelectasis a close second. Despite precautions such as bandaging the extremities and early ambulation, pulmonary embolism accounted for 9.4 per cent of the deaths. [Though inoperable carcinoma caused more deaths (22.2 per cent of the entire group) than any of the other diseases, it is classified as a multiple cause.] Since the mortality rate for major operations in both aged and young patients is still significant, there is great need for more accuracy in determining operability.

AB  - Abstract Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rapidly progressive soft tissue infection with high morbidity and mortality rates. Its occurrence in the head and neck region is uncommon, the majority of reported cases being limited to involvement of the neck, usually from infections of dental or pharyngeal origin. Involvement of the face from NF is rare; only 35 such cases have been reported in the literature since 1960. It is not only associated with a high mortality but can also result in severe disfigurement of the face, posing challenging reconstructive problems. Successful management of facial NF requires early diagnosis, prompt institution of broad spectrum antibiotics, aggressive surgical debridement to control the infection, and reconstruction of the resultant soft tissue defects. This report describes four additional cases of facial necrotizing fasciitis. One of the four patients died as a result of sepsis and multi-organ system failure. Two of the three surviving patients had significant facial disfigurement. A comprehensive review of the facial NF cases reported in the literature is also provided. Based on our experience with facial NF and the results of all previous case reports, the clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, and management of this disease are discussed.
