AB  - Abstract. The function of pancreatic grafts harvested from six pancreas-liver (PL) donors was compared to that of nine pancreas-alone (PA) donors. All donors had comparable physiological parameters. Pancreas and liver were flushed in situ with 4C Collins solution and the portal vein was vented immediately. The pancreaticoduodenal grafts were reflushed and stored in Collins solution (three PA and two PL), silica gel-filtered plasma (six PA and two PL), or University of Wisconsin solution (two PL). Later they were revascularized by the iliac vessels and drained into the bladder. All pancreas recipients were insulin-dependent. Serum glucose, amylase, lipase, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, protein, albumin, and urine amylase, bicarbonate and pH were monitored for 12 days. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U-test and Fischer's exact test. The PL grafts received a significantly higher aortic flush volume (5983 cc vs 1622 cc, P= 0.001) than those in the other group. Recipients of PL grafts had higher serum amylase (335 vs 250 IU/1) and lipase (1048 vs 424 IU/1), significantly lower levels of urine bicarbonate (11.2vs27.1 mEq/l, P= 0.01), pH (6.8vs7.3, P= 0.04), and amylase (9202 vs 19981 IU/l, P= 0.05) than those in the PA group. Moreover, they required longer periods of gastric suction (4.8 ± 1.7 vs 2.7 ± 3.1 days, P = 0.04), and despite central venous nutrition (4/6 vs 1/9 patients, P = 0.02) had significantly lower serum protein (6.0 ±0.7 vs 5.2 ±0.4 g/dl, P=0.02) and albumin (2.7 ±0.3 vs 3.3±0.4g/dl, P= 0.01) when compared to the other group and to the pre-transplant values (P= 0.03). These data suggest that high volume aortic flush induces pancreatic graft injury. Suggestions for improvement are discussed.

AB  - A seven-year-old, neutered male greyhound was presented with a history of episodic shifting hindlimb lameness and pain. Ischaemic necrosis of areas of the hindlimb digits and skin and a firm swelling within the medial right thigh musculature were found on physical examination. Investigation demonstrated thrombosis of the terminal aorta and right external iliac artery with ischaemic necrosis of muscular and dermal tissue distal to the sites of thrombosis. The dog was euthanased due to poor prognosis. Necropsy findings were of a poorly differentiated invasive sarcoma of the skeletal muscle of the proximal right hindlimb, thrombosis of the aorta and right external iliac artery and secondary renal glomerulopathy. Immunohistochemistry of the neoplastic tissue indicated angiosarcoma based on expression of CD31 and factor VIII-related antigen. Thrombosis was considered likely to be due to systemic hypercoagulability because of the presence of altered flow characteristics and endothelial damage in the vascular tumour bed. Aortoiliac thrombosis, paraparesis and hindlimb ischaemia are unusual sequelae of angiosarcoma in the dog.

AB  - Objective? To investigate the development of gingival hyperplasia in dogs after renal transplantation and administration of microemulsified cyclosporine A (MCsA). Study Design? Experimental study. Animals? Healthy adult mongrel dogs (n=5). Methods? As part of study on renal transplantation, dogs administered MCsA (20?mg/kg/day), azathioprine, and prednisolone to prevent graft rejection were monitored for development of gingival changes. Prednisolone was discontinued after 3 months. MCsA dose was adjusted to maintain whole blood trough concentration of 400?700?ng/mL. Gingival change was evaluated by weekly examination and photodocumentation, and gingival biopsy for histopathology was performed at 28 weeks. Results? One dog was lost because of acute graft rejection. Gingival hyperplasia developed in 3 of 4 dogs. The earliest gingival changes occurred in the interdental papillae at 20 weeks after transplantation. On histopathology, the underlying connective tissue was thickened and contained increase numbers of fibroblasts and inflammatory infiltrates. Conclusions? Long-term immunosuppression with an MCsA-based treatment likely induces substantial gingival hyperplasia when therapeutic, immunosuppressive blood levels of MCsA were maintained for 32 weeks. Clinical Relevance? MCsA is used for immune-mediated diseases and preventing rejection after transplant in dogs. MCsA blood levels, and gingival hyperplasia should be monitored by routine examination of the interdental papilla in dogs administered MCsA for long periods.

AB  - ABSTRACT A provisional diagnosis of azoturia and/or haematuria was made in a Greyhound. This condition was differentiated from the syndromes of acute abdominal accident, acute nephritis, cystitis and spinal pressure on sensory nerves by means of the clinical pathology aids of biochemistry, serum enzymology, haematology and urine analysis and the physical aid of X-ray and ECGT. The results indicated that the animal was suffering from acute azoturia. Résumé. Un cas d'azoturie et/ou hématurie fut diagnostiquée comme probable chez un Lévrier. Cet état fut différencié des syndromes de troubles abdominaux accidentels aigus, de néephrite aiguë, de cystite, et de pression spinale sur les nerfs sensoriels, au moyen des aides procurées à la pathologie clinique par la biochimie, la séroenzymologie, l'hématologie et les analyses d'urine, et avec l'aide de la physique, par Rayons-X et électro-encéphalographie. Les résultats indiquèrent que l'animal souffrait d'une azoturie aiguë. Zusammenfassung. Eine Wahrscheinlichkeits-Diagnose der Azoturie und/oder Blutharnen, wurde im Windhund vorgenommen. Diese Kondition differenzierte sich den Syndromen von Bauchakzidenz, akuter Nierenentzündung, Blasenentzündung und Rückgratsdruck des Sinnesnerven durch physikalische Hilfe von Röntgenstrahlen und EEG. Das Untersuchungsergebniss deutete an, dass das Tier von akuter Azoturie litt.

AB  - Research shows that low albumin is correlated with higher morbidity and mortality in the dialysis population. The reasons for this are multi-factorial and may be related to inadequate protein intake, infection and sepsis, inadequate dialysis, or catabolism of uremia. USRDS data show that ESRD Network 16 tends to have lower albumins compared to other ESRD Networks. Objective:? To evaluate albumin status of HD patients at Puget Sound Kidney Centers, Everett, WA (ESRD Network 16) and identify potential factors that may put patients at risk of hypoalbuminemia. Methods:? Clinical and biochemical data were collected for 3 months on 221 HD patients. Data included serum albumin (bromcresol purple), calcium, phosphorus, CO2, Hct, % saturation, ferritin, PTH, BUN, Kt/V, URR, nPCR, hours of HD treatment, interdialytic fluid weight gains, DW changes, incidence of infection and hospitalization, catheter use for dialysis access, presence of diabetes and other co-morbidities, dialyzer reuse, social/psychological status, and use of nutrition supplements. All biochemical data were collected after the longest interdialytic period and analyzed at the same reference laboratory. Data were averaged for each patient for the 3 months and correlations between parameters were determined using Chi-square analysis. Results:? 25% of all patients had albumins <3.2?g/dL (reference range for normal population 3.5?5.0?g/dL). Patients with lower albumins were significantly more likely to have DM (p?<?0.02), use catheters for HD access (p?<?0.001), had infections during the previous month (p?<?0.001), been hospitalized during the previous month (p?<?0.002), have co-morbid issues (p?<?0.001), and use nutrition supplements (p?<?0.002). No other factors were significantly correlated with lower albumin. Conclusion:? Factors other than nutrition seem to be related to hypoalbuminemia. This study has prompted improved protocols for catheter care and use, infection control, and early intervention for nutrition supplement use. Increased screening and monitoring at-risk patients (those with diabetes and other co-morbid conditions) has resulted in improved patient care.

AB  - Summary objective We aimed to study the effect of biosynthetlc growth hormone (GH) replacement In growth hormone deficient adults. design We performed a double-blind placebo-controlledcross-over study of 6 months biosynthetic GH, replacement and 6 months placebo separated by a 1-month'swashout period. patients Fourteen growth hormone deficient adults were studied. measurements We measured total body weight, percentage fat mass, lean body mass, muscle volume, exercise capacity, maximum oxygen consumption, muscle strength, bone mineral content, a number of biochemical parameters, IGF-I, GH antibodies andpsychological well-being. results Total body weight remained unchanged, but lean body mass increased (before GH mean ± SEM 49·8±5·5, after 53·4±5·6 kg; placebo before 51·2±5·4, after 50·4±5·1 kg; P < 0·05 and fat mass decreased (before GH 21·5±4·1, after 19·3±4·3, placebo before 19·3±4·0, after 22·5±4·5 kg; p < 0·05). Thigh muscle volume increased: (before GH 94·1±7·7, after 99·5±8·4 ml; placebo before 99·3±8·6, after 95·4±7·8 ml/0·8 mm computerized tomographic slice; P < 0·05). Exercise capacity increased (before GH 174·15, after 199·18·9 watts; placebo before 162·5±2·3, after 154·19·8 watts; P < 0·05), as did maximum oxygen consumption (before GH 1·93±0·2, after 2·17±0·2 I/m; placebo before 1·92±0·3, after 1·98±0·2 I/m; P < 0·05). There was no change in quadriceps muscle strength. Alkaline phosphatase increased (before GH 87·5 (32?158), after 106·0 (49?179) U/l; placebo 98·5 (50?145), after 72·0 (40?111) U/l; P < 0·05) without a change in the spinal bone density. IGF-I increased (before GH 62 (36?97), after 216 (62?362) ?g/l; placebo before 59 (52?112), after 60·5 (38?94) ?g/l; P < 0·05). Carbohydrate tolerance remained unchanged as did fasting lipids, serum sodium, potassium, urea, calcium, phosphate and liver transaminases. Psychological well-being remained unchanged. No growth hormone antibodies were detected before or after GH treatment. conclusions GH alters the body composition of growthhormone deficient adults and leads to improved exercisecapacity; alkaline phosphatase activity increases butwithout a change in spinal bone density, and carbohydratetolerance remains unaltered.

AB  - Abstract Background Recent studies provide evidence for significant and previously underestimated barrier damaging effects of repeated exposure to 60% n-propanol in healthy skin in vivo. Objectives To investigate further the cumulative effects of a range of n-propanol concentrations relevant at the workplace in healthy and atopic dermatitis (AD) individuals, and study the modulation of the outcomes by co-exposure and host-related factors. Methods Healthy adult and AD volunteers were exposed to n-propanol concentrations from 30% to 75% in occlusion-modified tandem repeated irritation test with measurements of erythema, transepidermal water loss, capacitance, and the natural moisturizing factor (NMF) levels at baseline and after 96?hours. Results n-Propanol exerted significant barrier damaging effects even at the lowest concentration in both groups. Exposure to all n-propanol concentrations significantly reduced the NMF levels. Preceding low-grade trauma by occlusion/water exposure reduced the skin irritation threshold in both groups. The differences in the severity of the barrier function impairment after exposure to the same concentrations under the same conditions between the AD and control groups were significant. Conclusions The negative effects of cumulative exposure to n-propanol in healthy and atopic skin shown in the study suggest the need for critical re-evaluation of its irritant properties in vivo.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the efficacy of meloxicam or tolfenamic acid administered preoperatively and postoperatively (five days in total) to cats undergoing surgical fracture repair. Methods: Eighty-eight otherwise healthy cats were matched according to fracture site and then randomly allocated to one of two groups, receiving 0·2 mg/kg meloxicam by subcutaneous injection (group M) or 1·5 to 3 mg/kg tolfenamic acid orally (group T) before anaesthesia. Analgesia was continued with 0.05 mg/kg oral meloxicam once daily or 1·5 to 3 mg/kg oral tolfenamic acid twice daily for four days postoperatively. Pain was assessed by a blinded observer using visual analogue scales and a functional limb score. The drug administrator assessed feed intake and palatability of the treatment. Results: Data from 66 cats were analysed. Visual analogue scale pain scores and functional limb scores decreased over time in both groups but were not significantly different between treatments. Feed intake was similar in both groups. Meloxicam was significantly more palatable than tolfenamic acid on all treatment days. Clinical Significance: Meloxicam and tolfenamic acid demonstrated comparable analgesia, without clinically observable side effects. Meloxicam may be associated with superior compliance in clinical practice due to the higher palatability and once daily treatment resulting in better ease of administration.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the safety of an intraoperative fluorescein sodium (FS) injection and elucidate the relationships between the MRI findings, pathological diagnoses, and intraoperative staining characteristics of intracranial lesions in 22 dogs. Study Design Prospective case series. Animals Twenty-two dogs with intracranial lesions. Methods FS was intravenously administered to 22 dogs undergoing craniotomy for suspected intracranial tumors to evaluate perioperative and postoperative adverse effects. The intensities and patterns of gadolinium (Gd) enhancement on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and intraoperative FS staining were graded, and their relationship was evaluated. Intraoperative FS staining characteristics and pathological diagnoses were compared. Results The only adverse effect noted was repetitive vomiting in 2 dogs. The intensities and patterns between preoperative Gd enhancement and intraoperative FS staining appeared to agree. High-grade glioma and histiocytic sarcoma had more intense FS staining. Lesions with strong Gd enhancement, including meningiomas and choroid plexus tumors, also had intense FS staining. Conclusion The intraoperative use of FS is a simple and safe technique to guide the resection of intracranial lesions in dogs. The findings on Gd enhancement, FS staining, and histopathology appeared to agree but require validation in a larger set of cases. Clinical Significance The intraoperative use of FS may improve the prognosis of dogs with brain tumors by guiding the resection of lesions.

AB  - Summary Patients with epilepsy have at least twice the fracture risk of the general population. The mechanisms for this increased fracture rate are likely multi-factorial, including fractures occurring during seizures, falls with fractures at other times, and underlying bone disease. Monitoring and recognition of the problem may help to prevent fracture-related morbidity in patients with epilepsy. Further research into causation and best practice management are required and would assist in the development of management guidelines for clinicians.

AB  - Summary This chapter summarizes assessment and management of the patient with sepsis. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory, cellular and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than sepsis alone. Management of sepsis requires invasive monitoring and critical care expertise. Arterial and central venous monitoring will be required if the patient is in septic shock or once in the ICU but placement should not delay initial priorities. The first priority is adequate fluid resuscitation, using a balanced crystalloid. This should be guided by a clinical assessment of the circulation and tissue perfusion. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in sepsis and is associated with a worse outcome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a complication of sepsis. This should be suspected in patients with sepsis and also in patients with septic shock who develop purpura, prolonged oozing from puncture sites or bleeding from the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts.

AB  - A cat receiving chemotherapy for lymphoma was administered a four times overdose of vinblastine in error. Severe, acute life-threatening toxicities occurred. The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) was suspected based on electrolyte disturbances. A favourable outcome was achieved with aggressive supportive care. Personnel involved in administering chemotherapy to small animal patients must check that the patient is receiving the correct drug, at the appropriate dose, prior to every treatment.

AB  - Summary Urine is a natural by-product of metabolism. It is a liquid vehicle by which waste is eliminated from the body. Normal urine is one of many shades of yellow, depending upon the degree to which it is concentrated. The yellow hue results from one of urine's constituents, partially oxidized urobilinogen. Various pathologies may cause urine to take on an abnormal color. Browns, oranges, and creams are observed in various diseased states; however, red urine is most commonly seen in clinical practice. The appropriate medical term for red urine is hematuria. Hematuria reflects the presence of blood in the urine. The etiologies of hematuria are diverse. Hematuria most often results from bleeding disorders, urinary tract infection (UTI), and urinary tract inflammation. Urinary tract obstruction (UTO), urolithiasis, and neoplasia were discussed in Chapter 65 as additional causes of hematuria. This chapter emphasizes UTI and feline idiopathic cystitis as two frequent causes of hematuria in the dog and cat. Urinalysis and urine culture with sensitivity testing are important diagnostic tools that can facilitate case management.

AB  - Abstract Objective Sepsis induces an inflammatory response that results in acute renal failure (ARF). The current study is to evaluate the role of S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) in renoprotection from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. Methods Rats were divided to three groups. First group received LPS (5 mg/kg body weight), second group was treated with LPS + GSNO (50 ?g/kg body weight), and third group was administered with vehicle (saline). They were sacrificed on day 1 and 3 post-LPS injection. Serum levels of nitric oxide (NO), creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were analysed. Tissue morphology, T lymphocyte infiltrations, and the expression of inflammatory (TNF-α, iNOS) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) mediators as well as glutathione (GSH) levels were determined. Key finding Lipopolysaccharide significantly decreased body weight and increased cellular T lymphocyte infiltration, caspase-3 and iNOS and decreased PPAR-? in renal tissue. NO, creatinine and BUN were significantly elevated after LPS challenge, and they significantly decreased after GSNO treatment. TNF-α level was found significantly increased in LPS-treated serum and kidney. GSNO treatment of LPS-challenged rats decreased caspase-3, iNOS, TNF-α, T lymphocyte infiltration and remarkably increased levels of IL-10, PPAR-? and GSH. Conclusion GSNO can be used as a renoprotective agent for the treatment of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury.
