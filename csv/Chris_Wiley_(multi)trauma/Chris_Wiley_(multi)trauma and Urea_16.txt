AB  - Abstract Objective Sepsis induces an inflammatory response that results in acute renal failure (ARF). The current study is to evaluate the role of S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) in renoprotection from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. Methods Rats were divided to three groups. First group received LPS (5 mg/kg body weight), second group was treated with LPS + GSNO (50 ?g/kg body weight), and third group was administered with vehicle (saline). They were sacrificed on day 1 and 3 post-LPS injection. Serum levels of nitric oxide (NO), creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were analysed. Tissue morphology, T lymphocyte infiltrations, and the expression of inflammatory (TNF-α, iNOS) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) mediators as well as glutathione (GSH) levels were determined. Key finding Lipopolysaccharide significantly decreased body weight and increased cellular T lymphocyte infiltration, caspase-3 and iNOS and decreased PPAR-? in renal tissue. NO, creatinine and BUN were significantly elevated after LPS challenge, and they significantly decreased after GSNO treatment. TNF-α level was found significantly increased in LPS-treated serum and kidney. GSNO treatment of LPS-challenged rats decreased caspase-3, iNOS, TNF-α, T lymphocyte infiltration and remarkably increased levels of IL-10, PPAR-? and GSH. Conclusion GSNO can be used as a renoprotective agent for the treatment of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury.

AB  - Background Anecdotal reports suggest a recent high prevalence of aspiration pneumonia in Irish wolfhounds, prompting further investigation into the incidence of the disease in this breed. Objectives To investigate the possibility that Irish wolfhounds have an increased incidence of aspiration pneumonia, and to consider possible predisposing causes in this breed. Methods Retrospective review of medical records from the Small Animal Specialist Hospital, Sydney, from January 2008 to December 2012 inclusive to determine the total hospital incidence and individual breed incidences of aspiration pneumonia. Results The total hospital incidence of aspiration pneumonia was 0?·?5%. The Irish wolfhound had the highest breed incidence, with 9 of 25 dogs (36%) diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. Four of the Irish wolfhounds had a predisposing cause identified; one having a choking episode, one having gastric bloat, while two were diagnosed with laryngeal paralysis after it was specifically investigated because of clinical suspicion. Five had no underlying cause of their aspiration pneumonia determined. Clinical Significance On the basis of the hospital population studied, the Irish wolfhound has a high incidence of aspiration pneumonia. Further investigation into the possible predisposing cause(s) in this breed is warranted.

AB  - Mycobacterium thermoresistibile was isolated in pure culture from ultrasound-guided pulmonary aspirates taken from a young cat with severe, chronic, pyogranulomatous pneumonia. Thoracic radiography and ultrasonography before therapy demonstrated severe diffuse alveolar disease. Twelve months combination therapy with doxycycline, rifampicin and clarithromycin resolved the infection. Thoracic radiographs taken at the completion of therapy showed multifocal pulmonary mineralisation. M thermoresistibile has been infrequently reported as a human or animal pathogen. This is the first reported pulmonary infection by M thermoresistibile in a cat and documents the successful treatment of the organism in a feline patient.

AB  - Summary Preeclampsia and eclampsia have the potential to produce significant maternal and fetal complications. This chapter addresses therapy for pregnant women with chronic hypertension and focuses on pharmacologic management that may diminish risk of superimposed preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is sometimes manifested by severe systemic hypertension. Careful control of hypertension must be achieved to prevent complications, such as maternal cerebral vascular accidents and placental abruption. Pregnancy-related blindness has been associated with eclampsia, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and hypertensive encephalopathy. Thrombosis and vasospasm develop and lead to multi-organ involvement, including renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, and uteroplacental dysfunction. Unlike most forms of preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome is not primarily a disease of primigravidas. The clinical signs and symptoms of patients with HELLP syndrome are classically related to the impact of vasospasm on the maternal liver. Thus, most patients present with signs or symptoms of liver compromise.

AB  - Summary Degeneration of the intervertebral disc (IVD) is a major chronic medical condition associated with back pain. To better understand the pathogenesis of IVD degeneration, we performed comparative and quantitative proteomic analyses of normal and degenerated human annulus fibrosus (AF) cells and identified proteins that are differentially expressed between them. Annulus fibrosus cells were isolated and cultured from patients with lumbar disc herniation (the experimental group, degenerated AF cells) and scoliosis patients who underwent orthopaedic surgery (the control group, normal AF cells). Comparative proteomic analyses of normal and degenerated cultured AF cells were carried out using 2-D electrophoresis, mass spectrometric analyses, and database searching. Quantitative analyses of silver-stained 2-D electrophoresis gels of normal and degenerated cultured AF cells identified 10 protein spots that showed the most altered differential expression levels between the two groups. Among these, three proteins were decreased, including heat shock cognate 71-kDa protein, glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase, and protocadherin-23, whereas seven proteins were increased, including guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(i) subunit α-2, superoxide dismutase, transmembrane protein 51, adenosine receptor A3, 26S protease regulatory subunit 8, lipid phosphate phosphatase-related protein, and fatty acyl-crotonic acid reductase 1. These differentially expressed proteins might be involved in the pathophysiological process of IVD degeneration and have potential values as biomarkers of the degeneration of IVD.

AB  - The RMH is a large, tertiary teaching hospital that is now a designated level 1 trauma centre. Facilities include a helipad and upgraded Emergency Department and Operating Theatre areas. In many cases it is not possible to provide group specific and crossmatched Red Cell Concentrates (RCC) for individuals requiring urgent and lifesaving treatment. In this situation, scarce O Negative RCC must be used. Previously, the Blood Bank at the RMH issued blood and blood products to the Emergency Department in plastic bags or foam eskies. Once issued these RCC could not be returned to the hospital Blood Bank inventory, as the product transportation and storing conditions to and in the Emergency Department were uncontrolled. Baxter Healthcare ½ recently has made available an innovative and validated system of transport for blood and blood products. This ?Blood-In-Motion?(BiM) system consists of moulded plastic elements that are filled with a patented Phase Change Material (PCM). Following our adoption of the BiM we found it an easy to use, validated system for the safe temperature controlled transport of RCC in an emergency situation. We have further utilised the BiM system as a ?Massive Exsanguination Pack?(MEP) used in response to a time-critical call from Emergency. The MEP transports 4 units O Neg RCC, 4 units thawed AB FFP & 1 pool Rh Neg platelets. This BiM/MEP system allows the storage of RCC and plasma products under controlled temperature for up to 6 hours. This solution has enabled the RMH to conserve a scarce and valuable resource, and to supply emergency blood products in a timely and controlled manner.

AB  - Eur J Clin Invest 2012; 42 (3): 290?302 Abstract Background and aims? Studies suggest clinical benefits of parenteral fish oil (FO), rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), over soyabean oil (SO), rich in n-6 PUFAs, in patients with pro-inflammatory conditions such as sepsis and trauma. Because the mechanisms behind these observations remain unclear, the present study explored the effects of intravenous infusion of FO and SO on fatty acid incorporation, immune functions and (anti)oxidant balance in healthy human volunteers. Methods? Saline, a SO emulsion and a FO emulsion were administered for one hour on three consecutive days at a rate of 0·2?g/kg?BW/h to eight subjects in a randomized cross-over design with a 3-week interval between treatments. Plasma phospholipid and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fatty acid compositions, and leucocyte counts and functions were assessed prior to the first infusion (T?=?0, baseline) and 1?day (T?=?4, early effects) and 8?days (T?=?11, late effects) after the third infusion. Results? Fish oil infusion significantly increased n-3 PUFA proportions and decreased n-6 PUFA proportions in plasma phospholipids and PBMCs. There were no differences in immune functions or (anti)oxidant balance between treatments at any time. Conclusions? The present lipid infusion protocol appears to be safe and well tolerated and provides significant incorporation of n-3 PUFAs into plasma phospholipids and PBMCs. In the absence of overt inflammation, no direct effects of FO were observed on immune function or (anti)oxidant balance. This model may be useful to evaluate effects of parenteral lipids in other settings, for example in individuals displaying an inflammatory state.

AB  - Objective:?? To determine whether serum antioxidant capacity measured by the electrochemical technique of cyclic voltammetry (CV) could resolve differences in severity of the inflammatory disease acute pancreatitis. Methods:?? Experimental animal study using male Wistar rats. Group 1 (baseline), immediate euthanasia with no surgical interventions; Group 2 (sham), identical surgical procedures to the pancreatitis groups but no intraductal infusion; Groups 3?5, acute pancreatitis induced by intraductal infusion of 3%, 4% or 5% sodium taurocholate respectively. Terminal blood and pancreatic tissue samples for CV, biochemistry and histology were collected at 12?h (Groups 2?5). Results:?? There was a significant positive correlation of the first serum cyclic voltametric peak current maxima (CVi1) with pancreatic histological severity (Spearman r = 0.51, p = 0.007) as well as with a number of other markers of systemic disease severity, notably bicarbonate (r =?0.57, p = 0.002), base excess (r =?0.65, p < 0.001) urea (r =?0.68, p < 0.001) and calcium (r =?0.60, p = 0.008). CVi1 was superior at indicating the severity of the disease state compared to a standard method of total antioxidant capacity measurement. Conclusions:?? CV was found to be a simple, technique that could differentiate between the physiological and histological severities of acute pancreatitis. Further clinical studies are now justified to determine if point-of-care CV offers prognostic and treatment-monitoring advantages for severe acute inflammatory illnesses within the critical care setting.

AB  - Summary In this chapter, we review the epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of eating disorders. In synthesizing this material, we note that the eating disorders truly underscore the relevance of a biopsychosocial perspective in the evaluation and treatment of psychiatric disorders. The epidemiology of the main eating disorders, anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN), is considered in terms of prevalence, age of onset, gender, race, socioeconomic profile, etc. Etiology appears to be multi-determined and probably results from the complex intersection of a variety of biological, psychological, and social variables, which vary from case to case. The diagnoses of AN and BM are examined in detail, assessment tools enumerated, and the medical complications summarized. The treatment of AN and BN are dealt with in turn. With AN, the importance of engagement with the patient and determination of the appropriate treatment environment are underscored, and strategies for behavior modification outlined, with the initial focus being weight restoration. The roles of psychotherapy and psychotropic medications are described. For BN, the normalization of eating patterns and the interruption of the binge/purge cycle are the initial treatment goals. Treatment options include behavioral strategies, psychotherapy, and psychotropic medication. The difficulties in assessing outcome in these patients are discussed, and the potential impact on fertility and pregnancy. Finally, binge eating disorder is briefly reviewed.

AB  - Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with a worldwide distribution affecting most mammalian species. Clinical leptospirosis is common in dogs but appears to be rare in cats. Both dogs and cats, however, can shed leptospires in the urine. This is problematic as it can lead to exposure of humans. The control of leptospirosis, therefore, is important not only from an animal but also from a public health perspective. The aim of this consensus statement is to raise awareness of leptospirosis and to outline the current knowledge on the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic tools, prevention and treatment measures relevant to canine and feline leptospirosis in Europe.

AB  - Summary Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory response to pancreatic injury., The response can be mild and local, or extend to peripancreatic and systemic inflammation. The systemic inflammatory response can also lead to vascular leak, pulmonary edema, hypovolemia hypotension and shock, and ischemic injury to the pancreas, kidney and intestines. The most common etiologies of acute pancreatitis are gallstones, alcoholism, and idiopathic. Treatment is initially aimed at fluid resuscitation, support of organ dysfunction, and in severe cases enteral feeding. Therapeutic endoscopy may be needed to dislodge an impacted gallstone to treat bacterial cholangitis. Treatment is supportive, and a plan to prevent recurrence should be implemented before discharge.

AB  - Summary Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid covalently bound in esterified form in the cell membranes of most body cells. Following irritation or injury, arachidonic acid is released and oxygenated by enzyme systems leading to the formation of an important group of inflammatory mediators, the eicosanoids. It is now recognised that eicosanoid release is fundamental to the inflammatory process. For example, the prostaglandins and other prostanoids, products of the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme pathway, have potent inflammatory properties and prostaglandin E2 is readily detectable in equine acute inflammatory exudates. The administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs results in inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and this explains the mode of action of agents such as phenylbutazone and flunixin. Lipoxygenase enzymes metabolise arachidonic acid to a group of non-cyclised eicosanoids, the leukotrienes, some of which are also important inflammatory mediators. They are probably of particular importance in leucocyte-mediated aspects of chronic inflammation. Currently available non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, however, do not inhibit lipoxygenase activity. In the light of recent evidence, the inflammatory process is re-examined and the important emerging roles of both cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase derived eicosanoids are explored. The mode of action of current and future antiinflammatory drugs offered to the equine clinician can be explained by their interference with arachidonic acid metabolism.

AB  - Objectives To investigate possible interactions visible on electroencephalogram recordings caused by concomitant administration of marbofloxacin and carprofen or cimicoxib in dogs without central nervous system disease. Methods Totally 21 client-owned dogs undergoing different surgeries were included in a randomised, blinded, clinical study. Each dog was assigned to one of two groups treated with either carprofen or cimicoxib pre- and postoperatively. After anaesthetic induction both groups received marbofloxacin intravenously while recording an electroencephalogram. Offline electroencephalogram analysis included qualitative evaluation and Fast Fourier Transformation. Postoperative analgesia was evaluated for 24 hours and after 10 days with the short-form Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale. Statistical analysis included Wilcoxon signed rank test, Mann?Whitney U test and Student's t-test with α set at 5%. Results Marbofloxacin injection caused no effects on quantitative and qualitative electroencephalogram parameters in both groups. No differences in postoperative pain scoring were found between treatment groups. Clinical Significance Concurrent use of marbofloxacin with either cimicoxib or carprofen did not induce neuroexcitatory activities in dogs without CNS disease directly after administration.

AB  - Abstract Our objective in this study was to identify the factors contributing to mortality in acute suppurative cholangitis which could be tested easily in every emergency clinic. This is a retrospective study enrolling 104 patients with acute suppurative cholangitis. Demographic and laboratory data were collected for analysis. In univariant analysis red cell distribution width, total bilirubin level, intensive care unit admission was identified as statistically significant (p?<?0.05) to predict mortality. Three variables were statistically significant in multivariate analysis: total bilirubin level equal to or more than 6.9?mg/dl, red cell distribution width equal to or more than 14.45%, and admission to intensive care unit. We found a new scoring system for prediction of mortality in acute suppurative cholangitis utilizing only three variables. This would serve as a simplified, rapid way to direct patients for advanced interventions instead of wasting time with more complicated and time consuming multi-variable scoring systems.

AB  - Introduction: Antibiotic resistance develops in human patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with increased duration of stay. The major selection factor is the use of antimicrobial agents. The hypothesis tested in this study was that antimicrobial resistance in fecal E. coli isolated from dogs increased with increased length of stay in the ICU. Methods: E. coli were isolated from rectal swabs collected on days 0 (D0, day of admission to the ICU), 3 (D3), 6 (D6), and 9 (D9) from all dogs housed in the ICU for 3 or more days. The E. coli were tested for resistance to nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftiofur, trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Thirty-two patients were included in the study, 17 with D0-D3 and 15 with D0-D6 E. coli isolates. Five E. coli strains were isolated each sampling day and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, resulting in a total of 60 outcomes per day per dog. The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) was calculated for each day up to D6. Univariate ANOVA analysis was used to analyze the data. Results: The proportion of positive outcomes (resistance) increased from 9.3% on D0 to 14.7% on D3 to 27.9% on D6. Resistance to the frequently used ampicillin increased in a linear manner with increased duration of stay. The proportion of ampicillin-resistant colonies increased from 19.6% on D0 to 39.1% on D3 to 68.7% on D6 (p=0.001). Resistance to the infrequently used amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, also increased significantly (p=0.026) and linearly. The increase in resistance to enrofloxacin was significant (p=0.046); but the increase in resistance to the precursor, nalidixic acid, was highly significant (p=0.020). No change in resistance to gentamicin was found. The remaining antibiotics tested showed an insignificant increase in resistance. Conclusions: Resistance to antibiotics increased in dogs with duration of stay in the ICU for 3 or more days. This linear trend was most significant with penicillin-based beta-lactams, which are frequently used in the ICU. Consequently, critically ill dogs may be at increased risk for developing opportunistic infections, caused by multi-drug resistant organisms.

AB  - Summary This chapter explores the main tasks a foundation doctor can expect to face in their surgical job, and provides practical tips and advice to guide them in becoming a proficient, confident, multi-tasking junior surgeon. All patients undergoing elective surgery will be assessed preoperatively, usually in pre-assessment clinics a few weeks prior to surgery. To reduce the risk of aspiration during anaesthesia, patients are fasted preoperatively. Obtaining consent is an art combining communication skills, surgical knowledge and perception. Further to all the checks doctor have done, further perioperative checks are done according to the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist. Thromboprophylaxis is essential in the surgical setting. One of doctor's most important roles on the wards will be management of post-operative patients. They will need a constant degree of suspicion for emerging complications, which may be directly related to surgery or indirect responses to the physiological stresses of surgery and anaesthesia.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study: The demands in the Standardbred trotters industry require young, still growing horses, to be trained well above light exercise level. During that period, the risk of occurrence of energy imbalance and maladaptation to training is high. In man, the lack of energy homeostasis is considered as the basic problem in the development of chronic fatigue. Objective: To find objective biomarkers of early maladaptation to training in young racehorses under field conditions. Materials and methods: Sixty-five 2-year-old Standardbreds were followed during their first 3 months of training in 5 different training centres. Monthly measurement of morphological variables (weight, height at withers, body condition score, body composition), basic haemato-biochemical variables and endocrine levels (testosterone, cortisol, thyroid hormones, leptin, IGF1, prolactin) were undertaken. Feeding levels and training programmes were also evaluated. At the end of the 3 month period, on the basis of an abnormal weight loss, 14 young horses were suspected of maladaptation to training (MT group). Morphological, haemato-biochemical, endocrine changes were compared between MT group (n = 14) and control group (C group, n = 40). Analysis of variance was calculated to study the effects of time and maladaptation to training. Results: Compared to C group, MT group showed a significant higher weight loss in relation to a higher loss of fat mass and body condition score (P<0.05). MT group presented higher GGT and white cell counts and lower red cell counts (P<0.05). Finally, MT group showed significant lower levels of T4 (P = 0.03) than C group. Conclusion: Some young horses presented signs of energy imbalance which were also associated with haematobiochemical and endocrine changes. Those markers might be useful for identification of maladaptation to training.

AB  - Macrophages are central to the inflammatory response and its ability to resolve effectively. They are complex cells that adopt a range of subtypes depending on the tissue type and stimulus that they find themselves under. This flexibility allows them to play multiple, sometimes opposing, roles in inflammation and tissue repair. Their central role in the inflammatory process is reflected in macrophage dysfunction being implicated in chronic inflammation and poorly healing wounds. In this study, we discuss recent attempts to model mathematically and computationally the macrophage and how it partakes in the complex processes of inflammation and tissue repair. There are increasing data describing the variety of macrophage phenotypes and their underlying transcriptional programs. Dynamic mathematical and computational models are an ideal way to test biological hypotheses against experimental data and could aid in understanding this multi-functional cell and its potential role as an attractive therapeutic target for inflammatory conditions and tissue repair.
