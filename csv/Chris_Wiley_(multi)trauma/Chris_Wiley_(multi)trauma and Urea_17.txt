AB  - Objectives: The aim of the study was to investigate the presence of serum antibodies to different Leptospira serogroups in dogs with a clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis in southern Germany and to compare seroreactivity to different serogroups with history, clinical signs, laboratory findings and survival rate. Methods: In this study, the data of 42 dogs with the diagnosis of leptospirosis were evaluated retrospectively. Dogs were presented to the Small Animal Medicine Teaching Hospital (Medizinische Kleintierklinik) of the Ludwig Maximilians University Munich, Germany, between 1990 to 2003. Results: Reactivity to the serogroup grippotyphosa (13/42) was most frequently present, followed by reactivity to the serogroup saxkoebing (10/42). There was no difference in the clinical picture and the laboratory changes between dogs whose sera were reactive to different serogroups. Clinical Significance: Most of the dogs with leptospirosis in southern Germany had sera reacting to serogroups other than icterohaemorrhagiae and canicola, which are contained in the vaccine. Thus, currently available vaccines in Europe do not protect against the most common Leptospira organisms associated with clinical disease.

AB  - ABSTRACT The features of 30 cases of canine rheumatoid arthritis are described. The disease is a chronic symmetrical polyarthritis characterized by erosive, destructive changes within the joint. The latter can be identified on radiographs by loss of mineral, the presence of discrete erosions or an irregular joint margin. Increased periarticular soft tissue is common and periosteal new bone is not unusual. The most obvious clinical feature is generalized stiffness particularly after rest. Joints are often thickened and painful on manipulation. A third of cases present with pyrexia, lethargy and inappetence in addition to lameness. Synovial fluid evaluation shows an increased number of white cells, most of which are polymorphs; the mucin clot is poor. The ESR is generally increased and rheumatoid factor (an antiglobulin auto-antibody) is present in 73 per cent of cases. Treatment is often unrewarding, although many dogs can cope for considerable periods of time.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study Current labelling for the use of ceftiofur crystalline free acid (CCFA) in horses states that 2 i.m. doses must be administered 4 days apart to provide 10 days of therapeutic coverage. A 10 day treatment regimen is not sufficient for the long-term treatment of horses with severe lung consolidation or pleuropneumonia. There are currently no data to guide an appropriate dosing interval when a longer treatment regimen is warranted. Objectives To determine steady-state plasma and pulmonary epithelial lining fluid (PELF) concentrations of desfuroylceftiofur acetamide (DCA) after weekly i.m. administration of CCFA to adult horses. Study design Experimental study. Methods Seven adult horses received i.m. CCFA at a dose of 6.6?mg/kg bwt on Day?0, Day?4 and every 7 days thereafter for 3 additional doses. Concentrations of DCA in plasma and PELF were measured at various time intervals. Results After weekly i.m. administration, the mean (±?s.d.) steady-state peak DCA concentration in plasma (2.87 ± 1.50??g/ml) was significantly higher than that in PELF (0.84 ± 0.53??g/ml). Mean terminal half-lives in plasma (77.5 ± 17.5?h) and PELF (92.8 ± 59.0?h) were not significantly different. Concentrations of DCA in plasma and PELF remained in the therapeutic range for the entire dosing interval. Conclusions After the initial 2-dose regimen 4 days apart, weekly i.m. administration of CCFA was well tolerated and resulted in plasma and PELF DCA concentrations above the minimal inhibitory concentration that inhibits growth of at least 90% of common lower respiratory tract pathogens of horses. Potential relevance Weekly administration of CCFA would appear appropriate when a treatment regimen longer than 10 days is warranted based on clinical signs and disease severity.

AB  - Hospital acquired infections (HAI) are a major source of morbidity and mortality in human and veterinary hospitals. Research in human hospitals has shown that well focused staff education is an important step in limiting the development of HAI. Our hospital currently has no training program with respect to HAI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the general knowledge of hospital staff concerning HAI as the first step in developing a hospital wide education program. Ninety doctors and technicians were given a questionnaire containing 15 questions about HAI. The questionnaires were hand distributed and immediately completed. Ten of the questions tested knowledge of HAI, while five questions concerned the individual's perception of HAI in our hospital. Answers were given as a range from strongly agree to strongly disagree or in the form of multiple choice. With respect to their perception of HAI, 66% of technicians and 50% of doctors believed that they possess a good working knowledge of HAI. Several areas for improvement in hospital staff knowledge were identified. Technicians were more likely than doctors to incorrectly believe that 1) routine environmental cultures are effective at preventing HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 30%, doctors 52%), 2) that all animals that aspirated gastric contents under anesthesia develop clinical evidence of pneumonia (percent correct answer: technicians 55%, doctors 84%), and 3) that animals with an indwelling urinary catheter should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics (percent correct answer: technicians 51%, doctors 90%). In addition, doctors were more likely to identify Amikacin as the antibiotic of choice for patients with HAI in our hospital (percent correct answer: technicians 27%, doctors 79%). Neither group was able to adequately identify the patients in the ICU as the primary reservoir for the multi-drug resistant pathogens that cause HAI (percent correct answer: technicians 20%, doctors 15%). The discrepancy in knowledge between the two groups is likely explained by attendance of faculty, residents, and interns at one or more continuing education rounds sessions where HAI were discussed. This finding is contrary to what is frequently found in human hospitals where the nursing staff typically demonstrates superior knowledge of HAI when compared to doctors. The results of this study demonstrate that knowledge of HAI is not optimal in both the doctors and technicians in our hospital. Further better focused efforts are warranted to address the educational shortcomings evidenced by this study.

The foal deteriorated despite intensive treatment and was subjected to euthanasia. At post mortem examination, the urinary bladder, ureters and kidneys appeared normal grossly. Histologically both kidneys showed disorganised development with the presence of structures inappropriate for a foal of this age, including primitive glomeruli, immature renal tubules and persistent metanephric ducts. Based on these findings a diagnosis of bilateral renal dysplasia was made.

AB  - Summary: The pattern of severe acute renal failure has changed considerably over the past 2 decades. Severe acute renal failure is now most commonly seen in the intensive care unit and is just one of the manifestations of the multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. the pathogenesis of severe acute renal failure is complex involving decreased renal perfusion, humorally mediated renal vasoconstriction and local migration and activiation of inflammatory cells. the initial final common pathway to renal injury seems to be outer medullary ischaemia. Protection from renal dysfunction in critically ill patients must therefore be directed toward sufficient haemodynamic resucitation to avoid inadequate medullary perfusion. Such perfusion is highly dependent on the maintenance of optimal intravascular filling, adequate cardiac output and, importantly, adequate renal perfusion pressure. In these patients, such renal perfusion pressure can often only be maintained if vasopressor agents are used and titrated to keep the mean arterial pressure at the highest effective and safe level (mean arterial pressure of approximately 80?85 mmHg in most septic patients). If severe acute renal failure develops despite full medical support, renal replacement therapy becomes necesary. There is now a growing worldwide trend toward the use of continuous haemofiltration techniques as the preferred mode of renal replacement therapy. Such techniques provide important practical advantages and, in many cases, are the only form of renal replacement therapy that the patient is able to tolerate. Continous haemofiltration also appears to provide not only outstanding haemodynamic stability but also some membrane adsorption and removal of the humoral mediators of sepsis. This makes continuous haemofiltration a particularly attractive approach to renal support and is responsible for this treatment now being the leading form of acute renal replacement therapy in Australia. After a relatively static period, the area of acute renal failure management is rapidly evolving and offering some promise of a level of support able to match the illness severity associated with it.

AB  - Cardiac surgery continues to be associated with excessive perioperative bleeding due to poorly characterised haemostatic changes associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and the trauma of major surgery. Blood component support varies between institutions and the recent introduction of recombinant VIIa promises to improve perioperative haemostasis, albeit at significant expense. Prothrombin complex concentrates (ProthrombinexTM-HT(PTX), CSL Australia) are utilised increasingly to correct excessive oral anticoagulation and have a number of advantages over FFP including greater coagulation factor concentration (particularly IX), reduced product volume and viral inactivation. There is no data on the use of PCCs in cardiac surgery. During a 6?month period (February ? August 2003), 203 patients underwent cardiac surgery at Barwon Health of whom 60 received PTX during the intra-operative or post-operative period (45 M, 15 F; Mean age 68.7?years). 28 (47%) patients underwent simple procedures (either valvular or graft surgery alone) while the remaining 32 (53%) patients had complex surgery (emergency cases, graft/valves, double valves, Bentall?s or redos). PTX was employed following the use of standard blood component support when there was evidence of persistent bleeding and abnormal laboratory coagulation studies. 20 patients intra-operatively and 34 patients post-op required no PTX. The mean dose of PTX administered intra-operatively was 595?U (range 500?2000?U) and 240?U post-operatively (range 500?1000). PTX use was associated with documented improvements in bleeding and coagulation studies; mean INRs and APTTs pre- & post- PTX 1.7?>?1.3 and 65?s?>?52s respectively. 33 (55%) patients were evaluated at 3?months through their physicians for evidence of prothrombotic sequelae. 8 patients were noted to have had potential prothrombotic complications (4 myocardial ischaemia, 1 pulmonary embolus, 1 CVA and 2 thrombophlebitis). Conclusion? On the basis of this small study, PTX is a useful adjunct to standard blood component support in cardiac surgery and may defer the use of rVIIa in this setting.

AB  - Abstract Objective To investigate an infusion of propofol for anesthesia in comparison to tiletamine-zolazepam anesthesia, evaluating physiological variables and recovery in squirrel monkeys. Study design Prospective non-blinded randomized study. Animals Eight healthy squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus), aged 3 years and weighing 0.340?0.695 kg. Methods Premedication was intramuscular midazolam (0.5 mg) and meperidine (4 mg). Anesthesia was induced with intravenous (IV) propofol (4 mg kg?1 minute?1) and maintained with propofol starting at 0.4 mg kg?1 minute?1 (PRO, n = 4) or IV tiletamine-zolazepam (5 mg kg?1) and maintained with supplementary doses of TZ (TZ, n = 4). Cardiopulmonary variables were measured continuously. Arterial blood gases and lactate concentration were measured at the end of anesthesia. Quality and times of recovery were determined. Repeatedly measured data for significant differences were tested between groups with t-test and within groups by anova. Results Median time for induction of anesthesia in PRO was 180 seconds. Mean maintenance infusion rate of propofol was 0.43 ± 0.05 mg kg?1 minute?1, varying during the 1 hour period. One monkey died after administration of TZ; others required 1, 4, or 8 supplemental doses. Cardiopulmonary variables were similar between groups, but hypotension was recorded. Recovery times to ventral recumbency in PRO (32 ± 17 minutes) and TZ (84 ± 11 minutes) and normal ambulation in PRO (58 ± 22 minutes) and TZ (358 ± 109minutes) were significantly different (p < 0.05). Recovery quality was superior in PRO, with less ataxia and fewer unsuccessful attempts to stand. Lactate concentration was not different between treatments. Conclusions and clinical relevance Cardiopulmonary variables were similar between protocols, aside from the higher incidence of hypotension in PRO, indicating that further studies with a larger number of animals are required. Compared to tiletamine-zolazepam, propofol anesthesia provided faster and superior anesthetic recovery in these animals.

AB  - Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a major health concern affecting more than 200 million people worldwide and studies have shown PAD to be a strong predictor of mortality, morbidity, and disability. The management of PAD is multi-tiered and advancements in technology have given physicians more options for endovascular revascularization if medical therapy does not result in substantial improvement. Many randomized controlled trials have reported efficacy of various therapies including laser atherectomy, stent technology, and drug-coated balloons over standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; however, uncertainty regarding the best standard of care remains unclear because of a lack of head to head comparisons between novel therapies. Furthermore, variability in the reported clinical outcomes exists and makes it difficult to evaluate the superiority of any specific treatment modality, especially for functional capacity and quality of life. Recently established consensus definitions for clinical outcomes coupled with investigators incorporating direct comparisons within clinical trials will be crucial to establish consistent care and meaningful gain in treatment for these patients. This review will highlight the treatment modalities, literature supporting each treatment modality, and insight into why they are being used and why variation exists around the United States.

They are found in up to 80% of patients with epilepsy but are only weakly related to seizure frequency or seizure severity. Indeed their clinical relevance in highly controversial and a principle of treatment is to avoid over-interpretation of epileptiform activity. Experimental data shows that interictal spikes and ictal discharges are generated by different populations of neuron through different cellular and network mechanisms and may represent a condition that delays or prevents seizure onset. However, in the immature brain seizure discharges may cause neuronal cell loss. In older children and adults interictal discharges can be accompanied by brief interruption of cognitive function even in the absence of overt seizures (transitory cognitive impairment). In children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome and CSWS (continuous spike-waves during slow sleep) prolonged nocturnal discharges can have devastating effects on language and / or behavior. This multi-disciplinary workshop will discuss the pathophysiology of interictal discharges and the significance of epileptiform activity in neonates and in older children.

AB  - Summary A significant proportion of the mortality and morbidity of severe burns is attributable to the ensuing hypermetabolic response that typically lasts for at least 9?12 months post-injury. This is associated with impaired wound healing, increased infection risks, erosion of lean body mass, hampered rehabilitation and delayed reintegration of burn survivors into society. The endocrine status is markedly altered during this period with an initial and then sustained increase in proinflammatory ?stress? hormones such as cortisol and other glucocorticoids, and catecholamines including epinephrine and norepinephrine by the adrenal medulla and cortex. These hormones exert catabolic effects leading to muscle wasting, the intensity of which depends upon the percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) involved, as well as the time elapsed since initial injury. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies may be used to reverse the catabolic effect of thermal injury. Of these, ?-adrenergic blockade with propranolol has been the most efficacious anti-catabolic therapy in the treatment of burns. The underlying mechanism of action of propranolol is still unclear, however its effect appears to occur due to an increased protein synthesis in the face of a persistent protein breakdown and reduced peripheral lipolysis. This article aims to review the current understanding of catecholamines in postburn muscle wasting and focuses on the clinical and metabolic effects of ?-blockade in severe burns.

AB  - A five-year-old, female spayed Labrador retriever was presented for further investigation of an intra-abdominal mass. Abdominal exploration showed a large mass arising from the right ureter and a ureteronephrectomy was performed. Histopathology of the ureteral mass was consistent with a spindle cell sarcoma. The patient recovered well, but five months later was diagnosed with another tumour, this time in her left abdominal wall. The owners decided not to pursue further treatment and euthanasia was performed a month later.

AB  - Summary Intellectual disability (ID) is a global and persistent reduction in cognitive abilities beginning early in development and associated with impairment in daily functioning including communication, social skills, personal independence and school/work functioning. Classification systems distinguish levels of severity based on measured intellectual quotient (IQ) and degree of impairment in adaptive functioning. Prevalence estimates for ID vary widely but aggregate around 2-3% in high income countries, with mild ID about five times more common than severe forms. The multiple factors associated with ID are discussed including chromosomal disorders, genetic abnormalities, psychosocial adversity, exposure to prenatal infections and alcohol, postnatal exposure to environmental toxins and severe early deprivation. ID is associated with a three- to five-fold increased risk for all psychiatric disorders and about 15% of children with psychiatric disorders have ID. In childhood, ID is most strongly associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Milder ID is often under-recognized and clinicians should be alert to warning signs, including poor academic attainments, school non-attendance and family history of learning and educational problems. When diagnosing psychiatric disorder in people with ID, considerations include the appropriateness of the behaviour in relation to developmental (rather than chronological) age and the multiple possible underlying causes for ?behaviour that challenges? should be carefully assessed so that targeted interventions can be used. In general, there are at present no effective treatments for the core cognitive deficits of ID. Interventions focus on appropriate education and support for affected individuals and their families that maximize quality of life and community participation. Treatment planning should be multi-disciplinary and multi-agency. The limited evidence base for treating psychiatric disorders in ID supports the use of similar interventions, although effect sizes may be diminished. Pharmacotherapy should involve lower starting doses, more gradual increases and careful monitoring, as people with ID are more sensitive to adverse effects. Psychological interventions should utilize behavioural strategies, supported with visual materials and the involvement of parents, carers and other professionals such as teachers. Family-wide support and respite care from voluntary groups and social services may be invaluable.

AB  - We present an atypical presentation of Ehrlichiosis induced sepsis requiring hemodialysis. Ehrlichiosis is a common tick-borne illness in Missouri, and in this case mimicks the course of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). A 48-year-old male with a history of marginal zone lymphoma had received radiation and chemotherapy with fludarabine. He was admitted to oncology service for evaluation of nausea and vomiting and generalized malaise. His initial laboratory data revealed platelet count 16,000?mm3, WBC 3,800?mm3, AST 327 units/L, ALT 185 units/L, BUN/Creatinine 53?mg/dl/3.8?mg/dl. Because the peripheral smear showed a morulae consistent with human granulocytic Ehrlichiosis, intravenous doxycycline 100?mg twice daily was initiated. Acute renal failure was thought due to hemodynamic changes, but the role of TTP remained in the differential diagnosis. On hospital day two, he became confused and lethargic and continued to be febrile. Hours later, he developed tonic-clonic seizures and became hypotensive. A clinical diagnosis of TTP was made. Peripheral smear showed only a few schistocytes, inconsistent with TTP. Microangiaopthic anemia, thrombocytopenia, sepsis with DIC, and multi-organ failure sustained the acute renal failure. Hemodialysis was used for ARF over the next several days in conjuction with IV doxycycline. The patient improved without plasmapharesis. Kidney function returned back to normal in due course of time. A final diagnosis of ehrlichia-induced sepsis with ARF was made. Conclusion:?Ehrlichiosis is endemic in Missouri and usually presents with thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver function tests; however it rarely presents with sepsis. The course of this case was made unusual possibly due to chemotherapy, fludarabine for the treatment of lymphoma, which can commonly cause micrangiopathic anemia, myelosuppression, and even a leukopenia for several years afterwards. This presentation mimicking TTP can be confusing but has previously been documented as a complication of severe Ehrlichiosis in the immunocompromised state.

AB  - This report details two cases of adverse drug reactions to amlodipine. The first case presented with diffuse peripheral oedema and a history of amlodipine therapy. Haematology, clinical chemistry, endocrine testing, thoracic, abdominal and cardiac imaging revealed no cause for oedema. Amlodipine therapy was discontinued and oedema diminished markedly within 72 hours. The second case presented for bilateral retinal detachments secondary to systemic hypertension. Haematology, clinical chemistry, thoracic and abdominal imaging were unremarkable and amlodipine therapy was begun. Within 72 hours, diffuse peripheral oedema developed that was unresponsive to therapy and the dog was euthanised. Veterinarians should be aware of the potential serious adverse events associated with commonly used drugs; severe, diffuse oedema is a possible adverse drug event in dogs treated with amlodipine.

AB  - Background:?? Previous studies have shown that nutritional status affects recovery after elective surgery. The impact of nutritional status in the acute surgical setting has not been well defined. Methods:?? Over a 4?week period consecutive patients admitted for >24?hours under the general surgical service at a tertiary hospital were screened on admission using the subjective global assessment (SGA) nutritional assessment tool. Results:?? Of 332 eligible patients, 310 were screened. Diagnoses at discharge were: Colorectal pathology (28%), Infective (23%), Hepatopancreaticobiliary (15%), upper gastrointestinal (9%), Vascular (5%), trauma (5%), other (15%). 5% had a malignancy diagnosed during their admission. Mean age was 52?years (95% CI 18?84), mean BMI was 28.6?kg/m2 (95% CI 19.2?41.7), and 170 (55%) were female. 48% were deemed well nourished (SGA-A), 40% had moderate/suspected malnutrition (SGA-B) and 12% were severely malnourished (SGA-C). Median (range) hospital stay was 3 (1?20), 5 (1?30) and 7 (2?38)?days (p < 0.001 Kruskal Wallis) for SGA category A to C respectively. Cox regression revealed that SGA was an independent predictor of day stay after taking age, malignancy, sex, albumin, lymphocyte and diagnosis into consideration. Conclusion:?? Nutritional status in the acute surgical setting, as measured by a simple clinical tool predicts duration of hospital stay. Admission nutrition screening may be considered in order to determine nutritional requirements of acute surgical patients.

AB  - Summary Kidney-derived c-Kit+ cells exhibit progenitor/stem cell properties in vitro (self-renewal capacity, clonogenicity, and multipotentiality). These cells can regenerate epithelial tubular cells following ischemia-reperfusion injury and accelerate foot processes effacement reversal in a model of acute proteinuria in rats. Several mechanisms are involved in kidney regeneration by kidney-derived c-Kit+ cells, including cell engraftment and differentiation into renal-like structures, such as tubules, vessels, and podocytes. Moreover, paracrine mechanisms could also account for kidney regeneration, either by stimulating proliferation of surviving cells or modulating autophagy and podocyte cytoskeleton rearrangement through mTOR-Raptor and -Rictor signaling, which ultimately lead to morphological and functional improvement. To gain insights into the functional properties of c-Kit+ cells during kidney development, homeostasis, and disease, studies on lineage tracing using transgenic mice will unveil their fate. The results obtained from these studies will set the basis for establishing further investigation on the therapeutic potential of c-Kit+ cells for treatment of kidney disease in preclinical and clinical studies.
