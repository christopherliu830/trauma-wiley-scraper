AB  - Abstract Purpose To assess health and musculoskeletal function in survivors of pediatric sarcomas. Patients and Methods Thirty-two individuals treated for Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT), rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), or non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NR-STS) with multi-modality therapy were enrolled on this cross-sectional study. Median age at the time of therapy was 15.4 years (range 7.1?34.2), median age at the time of analysis was 37.4 years (17.5?55.4), and median duration of time elapsed from completion of therapy was 17.3 years (2.9?32.6). Participants underwent assessments of musculoskeletal functioning, cardiac function, metabolic and lipid analyses, renal and gonadal function, and psychological evaluation. Results This cohort of sarcoma survivors shows expected locoregional limitations in function of the area affected by sarcoma, and impaired global musculoskeletal functioning as evidenced by limited endurance and limited overall activity levels. The cohort also demonstrated substantial rates of cardiac dysfunction, elevated body fat index, hyperlipidemia, chronic psychological distress, and infertility in men (76%) and premature menopause (49%) in women. Conclusion Sarcoma survivors demonstrate diminished locoregional and global musculoskeletal functioning which likely limit occupational opportunities and socioeconomic health. In addition, the combination of diminished cardiac reserve, limited activity levels, and lipid dysregulation in sarcoma survivors suggests that this population is at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, even many years following completion of sarcoma therapy. Sarcoma survivors may benefit from life long follow-up for cardiovascular disease and from occupational counseling upon completion of therapy. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2007;48:192?199.

AB  - Objectives To investigate the benefit of supplementing amoxicillin-clavulanic acid therapy with metronidazole in dogs presenting to a primary care veterinary practice with severe haemorrhagic diarrhoea. Materials and Methods Prospective randomised blinded trial on dogs presenting with haemorrhagic diarrhoea of less than 3 days duration to a primary care veterinary hospital and also requiring intravenous fluid therapy. Cases were randomised to receive either metronidazole or saline, in addition to standard supportive therapy consisting of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, intravenous fluid therapy, buprenorphine and omeprazole. Treatment efficacy was measured by duration of hospitalisation and daily scoring of disease severity. Results Thirty-four cases successfully completed the trial. There was no significant difference in hospitalisation time between treatment groups (mean for dogs receiving metronidazole was 29.6 hours and for controls was 26.3 hours) nor in daily clinical scores. Clinical Significance This study strongly suggests that addition of metronidazole is not an essential addition to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid therapy for treatment of severe cases of haemorrhagic diarrhoea in dogs.

Nevertheless, there are several important areas of controversy with regard to the surgical approach, differences of which may impact the rate of success and the incidence of adverse effects. Cognitive sequelae of temporal lobe surgery may result from (1) resection or transgression of the lateral (neocortical) temporal lobe or the temporal stem, which may lead to impairment in learning, and/or (2) resection of mesial structures, which may lead to decline in material-specific memory. The recent multi-center clinical trial analyzing the predictors of post-surgical quality-of-life will be discussed, including the finding that improvement depends on seizure-freedom irrespective of the occurrence of verbal memory decline. Nevertheless, it is incumbent on surgeons to minimize the occurrence of these cognitive sequelae while maximizing the possibility of seizure-freedom. Several approaches to gain access to the mesial structures will be compared with regard to cognitive outcome, including anterior temporal lobectomy (standard vs. tailored), trans-cortical selective AH and trans-sylvian selective AH, which differ in terms of their disruption of the temporal neocortex and temporal stem. Alternative approaches to the mesial resection will be compared with regard to seizure-free rates and the incidence of post-surgical decline in memory, including tailoring the hippocampal resection to the presence of inter-ictal epileptic spikes vs. performing a standardized resection, and the influence of the amount of hippocampal tissue resected. Open discussion of recent results addressing these important issues will hopefully either propel the field towards consensus, or highlight the need for further randomized clinical trials to improve patient outcome following amygdalo-hippocampectomy for MTLE.

AB  - Summary Reasons for performing study Neonatal encephalopathy is the most common neurological abnormality identified in neonatal foals, but its clinical course has been rarely characterised. Objectives To describe factors associated with nonsurvival in a population of foals diagnosed with neonatal encephalopathy. Study design Retrospective cross-sectional clinical study. Methods Cases were selected from equine neonatal (≤14 days of age) admissions between 1996 and 2007. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify clinical parameters, laboratory variables and therapeutic interventions associated with nonsurvival. Results A total of 94 foals were included in the study. Median age at admission was 12 h (range 0?96 h). The most frequently identified clinical signs included abnormal udder seeking (59%), abnormal suckle (55%), inability to stand (42%), abnormal gastrointestinal motility (37%), abnormal consciousness (34%) and seizure activity (22%). Overall, 75 (79.8%) foals survived to be discharged from the hospital and 19 foals died or were subjected to euthanasia. Variables significantly associated with nonsurvival in the multivariable model were serum total calcium concentration, serum activity of alkaline phosphatase, recumbency, number of concurrent diseases, and use of vasopressors/inotropes. The model correctly classified 92.0% of cases. Conclusions Overall survival was good and similar to previous reports. Vasopressors/inotropes were the only therapeutic intervention associated with nonsurvival, suggesting that persistent hypotension is associated with nonsurvival in the current population. Foals with concurrent disease, high total calcium and low alkaline phosphatase at admission, and that were recumbent or required treatment with vasopressors/inotropes during hospitalisation, were significantly less likely to survive.

AB  - Natural hydrogels have been investigated for three-dimensional tissue reconstruction and regeneration given their ability to emulate the structural complexity of multi-component extracellular matrices (ECM). Hydrogels rich in ECM can be extracted and assembled from soft tissues, retain a composition specific to the tissue source, and stimulate vascularized tissue formation. However, poor mechanical properties and rapid degradation hinder their performance in regenerative applications. This study investigates the effect of glutaraldehyde (GA) crosslinking on the mechanical properties, biological activity, and degradation of dermis-isolated ECM-rich hydrogels. Compression tests indicated that hydrogel elastic moduli and yield stress values increased significantly with GA exposure time. Lyophilization was shown to decrease yield stress values with respect to non-lyophilized gels. Crosslinked ECM, unlike non-crosslinked gels, was resistant to pepsin degradation in vitro. In a rodent subcutaneous implant model, crosslinking for 0.5 hours or longer drastically slowed degradation relative to controls. Inflammation was low and mature vascularized granulation tissue was observed in all gels, with an increase in vessel density at 1 week in crosslinked gels relative to controls. These results support the potential use of dermis-derived hydrogels as materials for tissue engineering applications and suggest that crosslinking can enhance mechanical properties and prolong hydrogel lifetime while promoting vascularized tissue formation. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer according to stage of disease, present diagnostic and therapeutic advances, and the biology of the tumor is summarized: Stage I: The increasing number of small localized tumors occuring with earlier diagnosis motivates controlled clinical studies of irradiation of the breast with surgical axillary node status for exact biological classification. Encouraging results with local breast irradiation need confirmation in controlled studies. Improved survival by local interventions will most probably be due to selection of cases with earlier diagnosis rather than to variations in local therapies. Curative therapy saving the breast may be envisaged. Stage II: Systemic therapies with effect also on local-regional soft tissue disease necessitate rethinking on the role of radiotherapy in Stage II Disease. Preoperative irradiation trials are biologically not logical in patients who are strictly operable and with a high risk of occult dissemination at time of irradiation. Adjuvant half body or total body irradiation to very high risk Stage II patients may now be logical to explore in a controlled study. Identification of the very limited subgroup(s) of patients who will benefit from radiotherapy in Stage II is open for trials. The routine use of postoperative irradiation in strictly operable patients is highly questionable. In spite of a demonstrated decrease of local and regional recurrence and the psychological trauma of discovering a local growth, the following four facts weigh heavily against the routine use of post-operative radiotherapy: 1) Overtreatment: (a) less than 10% have local-regional recurrence without distant metastases. (b) in the approximately 25% who get local recurrences, a watch policy with later radiotherapy gives complete local control in 70%. 2) Increased morbidity: besides a local-regional morbidity an increased mortality (+ 1 to 10%) can be correlated with the use of radiotherapy in 8/10 randomized trials (p > 0.04). 3) Systemic therapies: the logical way to improve survival. Multiple drug chemotherapy has been shown to be most effective against soft tissue metastases. It can not be excluded that radiotherapy diminishes the effect of systemic therapies (chemo-hormone or immunotherapy). 4) Social-economic aspects: The patient's time and money, doctor's time and society's resources may be better used. Priorities are necessary even in oncology. The interaction of radiotherpy with systemic therapies needs clarification. Stage III: Radiotherapy has a clear therapeutic role in inoperable tumors limited to the breast. Its exact role in synergism with systemic therapies in a multiple modality approach still must be defined in controlled studies. An improved local therapeutic ratio ought to result from exploring advancements in radiotherapy using radiosensitizers, high energy particle radiation, interaction with chemotherapy, and hyperthermia. With increasingly efficient systemic therapies, local tumor control in Stage III may translate into increased survival. Stage IV: A palliative effect is well established. Controlled studies are lacking analyzing whether there is a cost-benefit-ratio that is advantageous when compared to other forms of therapy. The indicated positive effect of half body/total body irradiation is open for a controlled trial.

AB  - Canine dysautonomia was diagnosed definitively in five dogs by histopathology. All dogs were seen between June 2004 and July 2006 and originated from south-east England; four dogs originated from an urban area and one from a rural area. Of the urban dogs, one had recently visited Scotland and one had visited a kennel in a rural area nearby. Acute-onset but progressive vomiting, diarrhoea, depression and inappetence were the most common presenting clinical signs. Reduced or absent anal tone, dysuria, absence of pupillary light reflexes with intact vision, mydriasis, decreased corneal sensitivity and nictitating membrane protrusion were among the most frequent neurological findings. Abnormalities in pharmacological autonomic and physiological function testing (including orthostatic hypotension in two dogs) and diagnostic imaging studies were detected in some of the animals. All dogs failed to respond adequately to treatment, and given the poor prognosis, they were eventually euthanased. Histopathology identified marked chromatolysis of ganglion cell bodies. This case series emphasises that dysautonomia should be considered when a dog is presented in the UK with acute- or subacute-onset gastrointestinal signs and compatible physical and neurological abnormalities.

AB  - Two littermates, a young male and female boxer, were admitted to the Utrecht University?s Department of Clinical Sciences of Companion Animals within a three month period. Both dogs suffered from anaemia caused by chronic intestinal blood loss, vomiting and weight loss. In both cases, there was no response to conservative medical management. Eventually, the dogs suffered significant gastrointestinal haemorrhage that resulted in collapse. Gastroduodenoscopy and exploratory surgery showed a duodenal diverticulum in both dogs. This is the first report that describes this congenital anomaly in two siblings.

AB  - Background and aim? Three serious transfusion-related incidents over a 9?month period highlighted the clinical risk in transfusion during 2001?2002. This lead to the development of a strategy to comprehensively review and implement transfusion safety initiatives across the Bayside health network of which the Alfred is a major hospital. Intervention The initiative commenced in January 2003 with the assembly of a multi-disciplinary team that consisted of medical, nursing, scientific as well as hospital executive representation. This was possible with the appointment of a Transfusion Nurse as part of the Victorian Department of Human Services Blood Matters Collaborative and a Transfusion Medicine Registrar, co-appointed by the hospital and Australian Red Cross Blood Service. The activities consisted initially of process mapping blood transfusion practice. Key areas were then selected for targeting process improvement, namely; ? Patient and product identification, ? Sample labelling, ? Blood component administration. Result? Initiatives implemented were; ? Widespread medical and nursing education on transfusion issues. ? Increase transfusion information availability. ? Network-wide implementation of strict criteria for specimen labelling (all specimens) in line with ANZSBT pre-transfusion testing guidelines. ? Development of a pre-transfusion testing and blood request form. ? Development of a blood administration form to reconcile all transfusion related documentation in the medical record. - Policy and guideline development. Conclusion? Sustained improvement requires ongoing dedicated personnel to maintain gains, continue to audit practice, analyse incident data both actual adverse incidents as well as near-miss events and to respond to these challenges within an ongoing and operational quality improvement framework.

AB  - Abstract Objective? To determine the cardiovascular responses of ephedrine and dopamine for the management of presurgical hypotension in anesthetized dogs. Study design? Prospective, randomized, clinical trial. Animals? Twelve healthy client-owned dogs admitted for orthopedic surgery; six per group Methods? Prior to surgery, 58 anesthetized dogs were monitored for hypotension [mean arterial pressure (MAP) <60?mmHg] that was not associated with bradycardia or excessive anesthetic depth. Ephedrine (0.2?mg?kg?1, IV) or dopamine (5??g?kg?1?minute?1, IV) was randomly assigned for treatment in 12 hypotensive dogs. Ten minutes after the first treatment (Tx1-10), ephedrine was repeated or the dopamine infusion rate was doubled. Cardiovascular assessments taken at baseline, Tx1-10, and 10?minutes following treatment adjustment (Tx2-10) were compared for differences within and between treatments (p?<?0.05). Results? Ephedrine increased cardiac index (CI), stroke volume index (SVI), oxygen delivery index (DO2I), and decreased total peripheral resistance (TPR) by Tx1-10, while MAP increased transiently (<5?minutes). The second ephedrine bolus produced no further improvement. Dopamine failed to produce significant changes at 5??g?kg?1?minute?1, while 10??g?kg?1?minute?1 increased MAP, CI, SVI significantly from baseline, and DO2I compared with Tx1-10. The improvement in CI, SVI, and DO2I was not significantly different between treatments at Tx2-10. Conclusions and clinical relevance? In anesthetized hypotensive dogs, ephedrine and dopamine improved cardiac output and oxygen delivery. However, the pressure-elevating effect of ephedrine is transient, while an infusion of dopamine at 10??g?kg?1?minute?1 improved MAP significantly by additionally maintaining TPR.

AB  - An eight-year-old, neutered male Burmese cat presented with five days vomiting and anorexia. Physical examination, clinical pathology and diagnostic imaging findings suggested a perirenal pseudocyst. After partial resection of the perirenal capsule clinical signs temporarily resolved, but the cat was euthanased 34 days postoperatively as a result of seizures and recurrence of vomiting. Postoperative histopathology showed neoplastic transitional cells within and lining the resected perirenal capsule; a diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma was confirmed post-mortem. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of this presentation of transitional cell carcinoma. Transitional cell carcinoma should be a differential diagnosis for the aetiology of perirenal pseudocyst.

AB  - Congestive heart failure is a common presentation in small animal practice. Cardiac tumours are an unusual cause of congestive heart failure and, when they occur, usually cause clinical signs associated with pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade. This case report outlines the clinical and histological findings in two dogs presented with clinical signs of congestive heart failure caused by obstruction of blood flow by intracavitary cardiac tumours. Case 1 showed signs of left-sided heart failure caused by osteosarcoma within the left atrial lumen, and case 2 presented with clinical signs of right-sided heart failure due to haemangiosarcoma occupying the right atrial and ventricular lumens. This case report provides further evidence for the inclusion of intracardiac neoplasia in the differential diagnosis for dogs with clinical signs of congestive heart failure.

AB  - Summary The production of tear film is a defensive mechanism by the body to protect the corneal surface from contamination with debris and microorganisms. In health, tear film is a three-layered composite of lipid, water, and mucus that collectively creates a smooth, even optical surface. Physiologic and pathologic states may alter the composition by impacting one or more layers. For instance, a decrease in the aqueous layer, as occurs in cases of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), results in mucus clumping and corneal irritation, with potentially devastating sequelae. Alternatively, aqueous tear production may be excessive. This could indicate a normal response to abnormal external conditions, such as intense wind or lighting. In addition, epiphora may result from chronic irritation secondary to ocular and periocular pathology, as from entropion, distichiasis, or trichiasis. Ocular discharge represents abnormal secretions at or around the eye. The presentations for ocular discharge are varied, but may include serous, mucoid, and mucopurulent material from one or both eyes. Because so many conditions can trigger ocular discharge, the diagnostic work-up is potentially extensive. To be thorough, the clinician ought to begin with comprehensive history taking and a whole-body physical examination, followed by ophthalmic evaluation. This may include conjunctival swabs and scrapes, the Schirmer tear test (STT), the use of fluorescein dye to assess for nasolacrimal patency and to detect corneal ulcerations, and tonometry. Examination findings and diagnostic test results help to refine the list of rule-outs and narrow the field to the most likely diagnosis. Treatment emphasizes resolution of the primary problem, whenever possible.

AB  - Objectives To further clarify the causes of pancytopoenia and to investigate whether underlying cause or severity were associated with survival in an area endemic for vector-borne pathogens. Methods Retrospective review of medical records of 119 dogs with and 238 dogs without pancytopoenia. Results Mixed-breed dogs and dogs younger than one year had higher odds of being pancytopoenic. The most common diagnoses included monocytic ehrlichiosis (n=42), leishmaniasis (n=28) and parvoviral enteritis (n=19). The mean white blood cell counts were lower in dogs with ehrlichiosis and parvoviral enteritis compared to dogs with leishmaniasis, while platelet counts were lower in ehrlichiosis compared to leishmaniasis or parvoviral enteritis. Total protein concentrations were lower in dogs with parvoviral enteritis compared to ehrlichiosis and leishmaniasis. Higher haematocrit, platelet and white cell counts were associated with better odds of survival. Clinical Significance Infectious diseases appear to be the leading causes of canine pancytopoenia in endemic areas; severe leukopoenia (ehrlichiosis, parvoviral enteritis), thrombocytopoenia (ehrlichiosis) and hypoproteinaemia (parvoviral enteritis), represented potentially useful disease-specific diagnostic determinants. The severity of pancytopoenia significantly affects the clinical outcome.

AB  - ABSTRACT A collie-cross dog with syncopal attacks associated with total atrioventricular heart block was successfully fitted with a programmable, ?physiological? pacemaker, employing atrial sensing and ventricular pacing leads. Transvenous placement of leads under sedation and local analgesia, followed by temporary pacing, then general anaesthesia for the fitting of a permanent pacemaker, offers advantages over epicardial pacing. The use of a ?tined? ventricular lead appears to reduce the risk of lead displacement.
