AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of serum fibronectin and serum somatomedin-C as nutritional markers during enteral nutrition support (ENS) of critically ill, traumatized patients using an enteral product containing high concentrations of branched-chain amino acids. Twelve critically injured patients received a standard enteral formula with 30 g of a 44% branched-chain amino acid supplement added to each liter of formula. Fibronectin concentration, somatomedin-C concentration, and nitrogen balance were measured on study days 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, 28 or until adequate oral intake began. Both fibronectin and somatomedin-C concentrations increased significantly from baseline by day 7 of ENS. Nitrogen balance increased significantly from baseline by day 4. On days 14 and 21, only somatomedin-C and nitrogen balance increased significantly from baseline. Nitrogen balance was significantly correlated with somatomedin-C concentration (r = 0.53, p less than 0.01), cumulative caloric intake (r = 0.68, p less than 0.01), and cumulative nitrogen intake (r = 0.72, p less than 0.01). The results of this study suggest that serum somatomedin-C is useful and serum fibronectin has potential in monitoring nutrition support response in critically ill, traumatized patients.

AB  - Abstract Traumatic injury to the brain is one of the leading causes of injury-related death or disability, but current therapies are limited. Previously it has been shown that the antioxidant proteins metallothioneins (MTs) are potent neuroprotective factors in animal models of brain injury. The exogenous administration of MTs causes effects consistent with the roles proposed from studies in knock-out mice. We herewith report the results comparing full mouse MT-1 with the independent α and ? domains, alone or together, in a cryoinjury model. The lesion of the cortex caused the mice to perform worse in the horizontal ladder beam and the rota-rod tests; all the proteins showed a modest effect in the former test, while only full MT-1 improved the performance of animals in the rota-rod, and the α domain showed a rather detrimental effect. Gene expression analysis by RNA protection assay demonstrated that all proteins may alter the expression of host-response genes such as GFAP, Mac1 and ICAM, in some cases being the ? domain more effective than the α domain or even the full MT-1. A MT-1-to-MT-3 mutation blunted some but not all the effects caused by the normal MT-1, and in some cases increased its potency. Thus, splitting the two MT-1 domains do not seem to eliminate all MT functions but certainly modifies them, and different motifs seem to be present in the protein underlying such functions. ? 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Summary Objectives? Post-traumatic hypopituitarism is well described amongst adult traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors. We aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of pituitary dysfunction after head injury in childhood. Design? Retrospective exploratory study. Patients: 33 survivors of accidental head injury (27 boys). Mean (range) age at study was 13·4?years (5·4?21·7?years) and median (range) interval since injury 4·3?years (1·4?7·8?years). Functional outcome at study: 15 good recovery, 16 moderate disability, two severe disability. Measurements? Early morning urine osmolality and basal hormone evaluation were followed by the gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) and insulin tolerance (n?=?25) or glucagon tests (if previous seizures, n?=?8). Subjects were not primed. Head injury details were extracted from patient records. Results? No subject had short stature (mean height SD score +0·50, range ?1·57 to +3·00). Suboptimal GH responses (<5??g/l) occurred in six peri-pubertal boys (one with slow growth on follow-up) and one postpubertal adolescent (peak GH 3·2??g/l). Median peak cortisol responses to insulin tolerance or glucagon tests were 538 and 562?nm. Nine of twenty-five and two of eight subjects had suboptimal responses, respectively, two with high basal cortisol levels. None required routine glucocorticoid replacement. In three, steroid cover was recommended for moderate/severe illness or injury. One boy was prolactin deficient. Other basal endocrine results and GnRH-stimulated LH and FSH were appropriate for age, sex and pubertal stage. Abnormal endocrine findings were unrelated to the severity or other characteristics of TBI or functional outcome. Conclusions? No clinically significant endocrinopathy was identified amongst survivors of accidental childhood TBI, although minor pituitary hormone abnormalities were observed.

AB  - Objective To evaluate C-reactive protein at presentation and during hospitalisation in dogs with acute kidney injury resulting from leptospirosis to compare C-reactive protein at presentation in dogs with acute kidney injury of different aetiology and to study its correlation with markers of inflammation, azotaemia and survival. Materials and Methods Prospective observational study of 41 dogs with acute kidney injury secondary to leptospirosis and 15 control dogs with acute kidney injury of different aetiology. C-reactive protein was measured at presentation in both groups and daily for 7 days in a subgroup of 28 dogs with leptospirosis. The associations of C-reactive protein with neutrophil count, albumin, urea, creatinine and survival were analysed. Results C-reactive protein was increased at presentation in all dogs with leptospirosis but was not significantly different from dogs with acute kidney injury of different cause. It was associated with markers of inflammation (neutrophil count, albumin) but not with azotaemia (creatinine, urea). It decreased gradually from presentation to day 4, with significantly lower concentrations in survivors than non-survivors. Initial C-reactive protein was only weakly associated with outcome, but its average concentration from presentation to day 2 was more strongly associated. Absolute and relative changes in C-reactive protein during hospitalisation and creatinine at presentation were not associated with survival. Clinical Significance Serial assessment of C-reactive protein may improve outcome prediction in dogs with leptospirosis compared with a single measurement at presentation or with markers of renal function.

AB  - Summary: Thirty-three patients whc had had prosthetic valves inserted in the preceding four years were investigated to estimate the value of various laboratory tests in the assessment of traumatic red cell destruction. A combination of the findings of an elevation in serum lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) and a fall in serum haptoglobir levels, was found to be a reliable and accurate pointer to the presence of red cell damage. This study indicates that the commonly used parameters of an increased reticulocyte count, a rise it serum bilirubin levels, the presence ol methaemalbumin (positive Schumm's test) and fragmented red cells in the peripheral blood, although very valuable in more severe cases, are not sufficiently accurate to be used as indicators ol minor degrees of red cell damage. Milc and clinically insignificant red cell destruction is very common in patients with artificial valves and only one case of the thirty-three studied showed no laboratory evidence of traumatic haemolysis.

Partial aneurysmectomy was employed in one case and a temporary to permanent shunt graft in the other two. The simplicity of the techniques is such that they may be used in hospitals which are not equipped for extracorporeal perfusion.

AB  - Objective To report clinical, laboratory and diagnostic imaging features and prognostic factors in dogs with leptospirosis from North-East Germany. Materials and Methods Medical records of dogs diagnosed with leptospirosis from 2006 to 2013 were evaluated retrospectively. Results The study included 99 dogs. At initial presentation, the most common clinical signs were lethargy (96%), anorexia (88%), vomiting (85%), painful abdomen (39%), diarrhoea (38%), oliguria (27%) and tachypnoea (26%). Abnormal laboratory findings included anaemia (63%), thrombocytopenia (63%), leucocytosis (57%), increase of plasma urea (84%) and creatinine concentrations (81%), increased liver enzyme activities (80%), hyperbilirubinaemia (69%), hyperphosphataemia (67%), hyponatraemia (64%), hypoalbuminaemia (55%) and hypokalaemia (29%). Radiological pulmonary changes were detected in 57% of the dogs initially or during the course of disease. Severe dyspnoea, oliguria, azotaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia and severe radiological pulmonary changes were more often found in dogs that did not survive. There was renal, hepatic and pulmonary involvement in 95, 92 and 58% of the dogs, respectively, and multi-organ lesions in 98 dogs (98%); 32 dogs died or were euthanased. Conclusion Several clinical and laboratory abnormalities were associated with a negative outcome; severe lung involvement was specifically associated with high mortality.

AB  - Summary This is a unique question-and-answer chapter for surgical residents and trainees, concentrating on the nutrition support in critically ill patients. The negative acute phase proteins are albumin and transferrin. Their serum concentrations fall immediately after the injury, in proportion to its severity. They are used to monitor the nutritional status of acutely ill patients. Areas of intense clinical investigation in which total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may eventually be shown to be of great value are cancer patients in general, sepsis and trauma, and general perioperative support to prevent or correct malnutrition. Although protein restriction was historically used to reduce risk from hepatic encephalopathy, such a strategy may worsen nutrition status, decrease lean muscle mass, and ironically lead to less ammonia removal. Many interacting biologic and clinical factors are responsible for the development of malnutrition in critically ill and injured hospitalized patients and also the hypercatabolic states associated with trauma, sepsis, cancer, and surgical interventions.

AB  - Aims To investigate the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin in critically ill patients on continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF), a continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and to see if routine measures approximate vancomycin clearance. Methods Pharmacokinetic profiles (15) of initial and steady-state doses of 750?mg twice daily intravenous vancomycin were obtained from blood and ultrafiltrate samples from 10 critically ill patients in the intensive care unit, with acute renal failure on CVVHDF (1?l?h?1 dialysate plus 2?l?h?1 filtration solution; 3?l?h?1 effluent; extracorporeal blood flow 200?ml?min?1). Results CVVHDF clearance of vancomycin was 1.8?±?0.4?l?h?1 (30?±?6.7?ml?min?1). This was 1.3?7.2 times that reported previously for vancomycin using other forms of CRRT. Total vancomycin body clearance was 2.5?±?0.7?l?h?1 (41.7?±?11.7?ml?min?1). The clearance of vancomycin by CVVHDF was 76?±?16.5% of the total body clearance. CVVHDF removed approximately half the vancomycin dose during the 12-h period (ACVVHDF?=?413?mg). The fraction eliminated by all routes was 60%. The sieving coefficient for vancomycin was 0.7?±?0.1 and for urea was 0.8?±?0.06. Conclusions Vancomycin is cleared effectively by CVVHDF. Clearance was faster than other forms of CRRT, therefore doses need to be relatively high. Urea clearance slightly overestimates vancomycin clearance. The administered doses of 750?mg every 12?h were too high and accumulation occurred, as only approximately 60% of a dose was cleared over this period. The maintenance dose required to achieve a target average steady-state plasma concentration of 15?mg?l?1 can be calculated as 450?mg every 12?h.

AB  - Summary Host genetic variations may influence a changing profile of biochemical markers and outcome in patients with trauma/injury. The objective of this study was to assess clinical associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes of cytokines in critically ill patients. A total of 430 patients were genotyped for SNPs in the genes of pro- (IL1B, IL6, IL8) and anti-inflammatory (IL4, IL10, IL13) cytokines. The main end-points were sepsis, mortality and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We evaluated the dynamic levels of bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, creatine kinase, creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase in five points of measurements (between 1 and 14 days after admission) and correlated them with SNPs. High-producing alleles of proinflammatory cytokines protected patients against sepsis (IL1B ?511A and IL8 ?251A) and mortality (IL1B ?511A). High-producing alleles of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL4 ?589T and IL13 431A (144Gln) were less frequent in ARDS patients. The carriers of IL6 ?174C/C genotypes were prone to the increased levels of biochemical markers and acute kidney and liver insufficiency. Genotype-dependent differences in the levels of biochemical indicators gradually increased to a maximal value on the 14th day after admission. These findings suggest that genetic variability in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to different clinical phenotypes in patients at high risk of critical illness.

AB  - Abstract l-citrulline is a naturally occurring non-essential amino acid, an intermediate in urea cycle and conditionally essential in intestinal pathology. It is a potent hydroxyl radical scavenger and much more effective precursor of arginine and nitric oxide (NO) than arginine itself so exploited in therapeutics. Plasma citrulline concentration is used by clinicians to assess functional enterocyte mass in various chronic and acute small bowel pathologies like short bowel syndrome that has become an indication in clinical practice. Its supplementation is likely to be used in conditions like erectile dysfunction, sickle cell anemia, short bowel syndrome (to restore nitrogen balance), hyperlipidemia, cancer chemotherapy, hypercholestremia, in hyperoxic lung damage, urea cycle disorders, Alzheimers disease, multi-infarct dementia and as an immunomodulator. Its emerging role as a biomarker in intestinal pathology and early diagnosis of Rheumatoid arthritis has spread considerable interest. Antibody detection to Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (ACCP) antibodies can be recommended for early detection of RA decreasing joint damage and deformity, because these are detected well before the onset of disease manifestations of RA. The test is highly specific than RF (Rheumatoid factor), with moderate sensitivity, but much useful in differentiating RA from other disorders. Further studies and exploration is required in these areas.

AB  - Summary Intestinal hyperammonaemia in horses is a syndrome putatively caused by increased intestinal production and/or absorption of ammonia that clinically manifests as severe neurological abnormalities often in conjunction with signs of gastrointestinal dysfunction but without evidence of hepatic compromise. Ingestion of Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a novel primary condition that may predispose to development of the syndrome as described in this issue. Treatment of the condition is symptomatic and aimed at decreasing blood ammonium concentrations by reducing further production and absorption, reducing brain oedema and preventing self-inflicted trauma. Prognosis for survival is guarded, particularly in cases with severe gastrointestinal lesions, and is influenced by the ability to control clinical signs.

AB  - Proteomics and systems biology have significantly contributed to biomarker discovery in the field of brain injury. This study utilized 2D-DIGE-PMF-MS as a preliminary screen to detect biomarkers in a rat model of penetrating ballistic-like brain injury (PBBI). Brain-specific systems biology analysis of brain tissue identified 386 proteins having a fold change of more than 2, of which 321 proteins were increased and 65 were decreased 24 h after PBBI compared to sham controls. The majority of upregulated proteins were cytoskeletal (10.5%), nucleic acid binding (9.3%), or kinases (8.9%). Most proteins were involved in protein metabolism (22.7%), signal transduction (20.4%), and development (9.6%). Pathway analysis indicated that these proteins were involved in neurite outgrowth and cell differentiation. Semiquantitative Western blotting of 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after PBBI indicated ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1 (a proposed traumatic brain injury biomarker in human clinical trials), tyrosine hydroxylase, and syntaxin-6 were found to be consistently elevated in brain tissue and cerebral spinal fluid after PBBI compared to sham controls. Combining proteomics and brain-specific systems biology can define underlying mechanisms of traumatic brain injury and provide valuable information in biomarker discovery that, in turn, may lead to novel therapeutic targets.

AB  - Summary Veterinary technicians play an important role in preoperative planning by performing tests and providing the veterinary surgeon and anesthesia staff with the results. They also follow the veterinarian's orders by calculating medication dosage, filling prescriptions, and administering medications. Preoperative tests include complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry panel, and urinalysis. A database of a packed cell volume (PCV), total protein and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and blood glucose via a glucometer provides the minimal information required prior to surgery. In addition to the common blood and urine tests, a variety of conditions benefit from preoperative sampling. These include fine needle aspirates (FNA) of joints, abdomen, pulmonary spaces, masses, cysts, and abscesses for cytologic exam. Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative imaging - radiographs, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast studies, and ultrasound - aid in diagnosis, surgical planning, and evaluation. Individual and combined modalities provide the surgeon and veterinary technician with specific information.

AB  - Objectives: Immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) is a severe disease for which evidence is lacking to make informed choices regarding immunosuppressive regimen. The aims of the current study were to determine the effect of different treatment regimens on outcome in affected animals and to identify parameters that may be used as prognostic factors for the disease. Methods: The records of dogs presenting to a veterinary hospital in the period 2002 to 2010 for treatment of IMHA were examined and follow-up data were obtained. Statistical tests were performed to establish whether treatment regimen affected outcome and to identify prognostic factors for outcome. Results: Treatment regimen had a significant effect on the outcome (measured as survival of hospitalisation) but there were insufficient subjects to determine the cause of the difference. Serum bilirubin and urea concentrations were found to be significant negative prognostic factors for the outcome of IMHA cases and the concentrations of these parameters were significantly different between animals that survived or died while hospitalised. Clinical Significance: This study presents the first report of a significant difference in outcome comparing animals treated with immunosuppressive drugs which are in widespread clinical usage. Although possible confounding factors should be considered, these findings could have major consequences for the treatment of IMHA.
