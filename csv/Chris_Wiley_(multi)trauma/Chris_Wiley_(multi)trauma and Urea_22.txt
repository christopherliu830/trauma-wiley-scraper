AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to describe the response in heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, hematocrit and plasma lactate concentration in Icelandic horses performing the riding assessment in an official breed evaluation field test (BEFT) in Iceland (April 2011). It was hypothesized that the riding assessment constituted high intensity exercise. Methods Data was collected from 15 of 28 horses shown at the BEFT. Horses were judged for riding abilities (all gaits) on a straight track. Respiratory rate and rectal temperature were recorded and blood samples were taken from the jugular vein before the warm-up and within 5?min after the riding assessment. Hematocrit was analysed by centrifugation of capillary tubes and plasma lactate concentration using an enzymatic and spectrophotometric method. Velocity, distance and heart rate were recorded (Polar, Kempele, Finland) during the riding assessment. Anova (Proc GLM) was performed in SAS and data is presented as LSMean ±?SE (P<0.05). Results The distance covered was 2.7?±?0.1?km, the duration 9:13?±?0:21?min?:?sec and the average speed 17.5?±?0.3?km/h. The peak heart rate was 214?±?3?bpm. Post-exercise plasma lactate concentration was 18.6?±?1.7?mmol/L and there was an increase (P<0.001) in respiratory rate (40?±?6 to 118?±?6 breaths/min), rectal temperature (38.1?±?0.1 to 39.8?±?0.1°C) and hematocrit (35?±?2 to 47?±?2%) following the breed evaluation field test. Conclusions The physiological responses indicate that the riding assessment in BEFT is a demanding exercise, requiring some contribution of anaerobic metabolism. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by the National Animal Research Committee of Iceland. Owners and trainers were informed that participation was voluntary.

AB  - Introduction The Accutrend? Lactate (formerly Accusport?) is a low cost point-of-care L-lactate analyser. The analyser is widely used in the training of horses and has been used for research studies and to assist the clinical management of critically ill horses. The analyser is reported to be linear from 0.8?22.0?mmol/L (blood) and 0.7?26.0?mmol/L (plasma); however, test performance at high L-lactate concentrations in equine blood and plasma has not been well documented. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of the Accutrend? Lactate analyzer over a wide range of L-lactate concentrations in paired blood and plasma samples. Methods Duplicate jugular blood samples were collected from 8 trained Standardbreds before, during, and after a simulated race on a treadmill into 4?mL partially evacuated tubes containing lithium heparin. Blood and plasma L-lactate concentrations were measured using a colorimetric lactate-oxidase mediated reaction (BM-Lactate? test strips and Accutrend? Lactate) and the reference enzymatic method (L-lactic dehydrogenase spectrophotometry at 340?nm using samples deproteinized with 8% perchloric acid). Data was analysed using Deming regression and Bland-Altman plots adjusted for repeated measures (P<0.05). Results The reference method measured a wide range of L-lactate concentrations in 128 blood (0.2?23.8?mmol/L) and 127 plasma (0.3?41.1?mmol/L) samples. The Accutrend? Lactate analyzer provided an accurate method of L-lactate measurement, but only when blood and plasma L-lactate concentrations were <12.5?mmol/L (79% of samples) and <15.0?mmol/L (64% of samples), respectively. Conclusions Blood L-lactate concentrations >12.5?mmol/L and plasma L-lactate concentrations >15.0?mmol/L measured by the Accutrend? Lactate analyzer underestimate the true value by a variable amount when compared with the enzymatic reference method.

AB  - Introduction During canter and gallop most horses maintain a locomotor-respiratory coupling (LRC) ratio of one breath every stride. Occasional big respiratory cycles (BRC) are described when a single breath is taken over two strides. This is considered a transient but normal feature of ventilation. However, a change to a more persistent 2:1 LRC ratio is considered to be ?abnormal?. It has been suggested that upper respiratory tract (URT) disorders could result in a horse adopting an abnormal breathing pattern, although current information is limited. Methods Simultaneous audio and URT endoscopy recordings from 365 horses referred for treadmill evaluation were analysed. Breathing pattern at canter and gallop was categorised at each one minute speed step: Normal: 1:1 with <2 BRC Normal: 1:1 with 2 BRC Abnormal: breathing pattern disrupted by repetitive and frequent BRC's Abnormal: alternating between periods of 2:1 and 1:1 Abnormal: 2:1 throughout Data analysis was performed using PASW 18.0. A chi-square test was used to identify associations between breathing pattern and presence of URT obstructions. Results During the entire exercise test 30% of horses had an abnormal breathing pattern at canter or gallop, of which 23% had a 2:1 breathing pattern. The prevalence of abnormal breathing patterns was higher at low canter speeds than during strenuous exercise. There was a significant association between breathing pattern during strenuous exercise and the presence of an URT obstruction (P?=?0.008). Conclusions Loss of a 1:1 LRC ratio during canter and gallop is more common than previously realised and may be associated with dynamic URT obstructions.

AB  - Introduction Chuckwagon racing involves 4 Thoroughbred horses pulling a 600?kg wagon through a figure-8 pattern and running a 1000?m dash. Horses can race four days in a row and there are concerns regarding the contribution of cumulative racing to electrolyte imbalances, arrhythmias, and sudden death, and its impact on recovery. The objective was to investigate the effects of cumulative racing on plasma electrolytes, lactate and prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias. Methods 148 horses (9.0?±?2.7 years) from 13 teams were monitored for heart rate and ECG activity on racing days 1 and 2. Differences in plasma electrolytes, pH and lactate (pre-vs. post-exercise and between days) were analysed (paired t-test). Associations between electrolytes and the presence of arrhythmias during racing and recovery (Pearson correlation) were examined. Results 377 ECGs (82 incomplete due to lost electrode) and 750 plasma samples (374 pre, 376 post) were analysed. 4235 arrhythmic events (21.6% warm-up, 37.6% racing, 20.4% recovery) were recorded and were not different between days 1 and 2. They mainly comprised supraventricular premature contractions during warm-up and racing (48% and 81.4% respectively) and ventricular premature contractions during recovery (29.2%). A significant association was found between post-exercise electrolytes and the presence of arrhythmias during racing (P<0.001, r?=?0.17). Consecutive racing significantly increased post-exercise lactate on day 2 (P<0.001). Pre-exercise pH and electrolytes were significantly different on day 2. Conclusions An association exists between post-exercise electrolytes and occurrence of arrhythmias during consecutive racing, however it is of little clinical significance. Ventricular arrhythmias are as prevalent in chuckwagon horses as in other disciplines. Overall, repetitive racing is well tolerated.

AB  - Introduction There are no published studies that characterize the different myofiber types of Mangalarga (ML) horses and hybrids. This study aimed to characterize and compare muscle fibers of the gluteus medius of ML mares and young and inactive mules resulting from the breeding of these mares with a Brazilian donkey. Methods Percutaneous biopsies were performed in 11 mares and their foals (10 mules), at a depth of 60?mm. Fiber types were determined by comparing identical images using both the staining techniques of myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase (mATPase) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR). Stains for mATPase were pre-incubated in acid medium followed by alkaline incubation. The frequency (F%) and relative total area (RTA%) of fiber types I, IIA and IIX were analysed. The cross-sectional area (CSA, ?m2) was quantified by the NADH-TR technique. The means were compared using ANOVA followed by Tukey test (P<0.05). Results The frequency of type IIA fibers was greater than types I and IIX. Type IIX fibers had higher CSA than I and IIA. The RTA of type IIX fibers was greater than type IIA fibers followed by type I. The higher RTA value of IIX fibers resulted from higher CSA. There was no difference between the variables for mares compared to the mules. Conclusions ML mares and mules that resulted from breeding with the Brazilian donkey have a high prevalence of type IIA fibers in the gluteus medius. This fatigue-resistant fiber uses both metabolic pathways, glycolytic and oxidative, to obtain energy during muscle contraction, thus giving the ML mares and mules good performance in horseback riding, marching contests and endurance rides.

AB  - Introduction The 227-bp SINE insertion in the promoter region of the MSTN gene, the intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of MSTN, g.66493737C>T, and the SNPs BIEC2-417274 and BIEC2-417495 located upstream and downstream of MSTN seem appropriate QTL markers for racing performance of elite Thoroughbreds. This pilot study aimed to find if these markers of racing ability can be used to optimize the management of the racing careers of Turkish Thoroughbreds. Methods Hair roots were used for DNA extraction. The promoter insertion was analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR product. The SNPs were typed by the amplification refractory mutation system-real-time PCR. Best racing distance was defined as the distance of the races in which the horse obtained the best results. Results were semi quantified by a point score based on wining and places. Results BIEC2-417274, BIEC2-417495 SNP variants and the 227-bp SINE were strongly associated with g.66493737C>T. For the latter, the genotype frequencies were: C/C 0.23, C/T 0.52 and T/T 0.25. In total 39% of the Turkish races are distances >1600?m. Analysis of the racing career showed that both the sprinters (C/C) and the medium distance horse (C/T) were not entered optimally in races that fit with their genetic ability. Conclusions Turkish race programing should create more opportunities for the g.66493737 C/T genotypes to show their ability. This implies that more 1700 to 2800?m races should be scheduled in the racing calendar. Ethical Animal Research Owner informed consent was obtained. Sources of funding:?Jockey Club of Turkey.

AB  - Introduction Recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN) is considered height-linked in Thoroughbreds. A SNP (BIEC2-808543) proximal to the LCORL/NCAPG gene significantly influences height variation in horses. It has been suggested that the C-allele of this SNP is associated with RLN risk. Our objective was to investigate the association between the BIEC2-808543 C-allele, RLN and height in a cohort of Thoroughbreds. Methods Resting and exercising upper respiratory tract endoscopic videos, laryngeal ultrasonograms, wither height, age and sex were recorded in 79 Thoroughbreds (age 34?±?11 months). The Havemeyer grading scale was used to characterise RLN cases (Grade B or C at exercise) and controls (Grade 1.1 or 2.1 at rest, Grade A at exercise, normal laryngeal ultrasound). All horses were genotyped for the BIEC2-808543 SNP using a custom TaqMan SNP Genotyping assay. Logistic regression was performed measuring additive effects of allele dosage with sex, age and height as covariates (P≤0.05). Horses were subcategorised into tall (T,≥162?cm) and short (S,<162?cm) groups for C-allele frequency determination, with data presented as mean?±?SD. Results There were 16 RLN cases (height 164.5?±?4?cm) and 32 controls (height 156.2?±?4?cm). With sex and age as covariates, a significant association between the C-allele and RLN cases was observed (P?=?0.01). With height included as a covariate, a strong trend of association between the C-allele and RLN remained (P?=?0.06). C-allele frequency was 41.7% for the T-RLN group (n?=?12, height 166.2?±?3?cm), 12.5% for the S-RLN group (n?=?4, height 159.5?±?2?cm), 13% for the T-Control group (n?=?16, height 165.1?±?2?cm) and 14% for the S-Control group (n?=?16, height 156.2?±?4?cm). Conclusions The association between the BIEC-808543 C-allele and RLN appears to be independent of height. Ethical Animal Research Institutional Animal Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained.

AB  - Introduction The horse has evolved to survive on a low-energy, high-fibre diet. The addition of starch, in the form of cereals, to the diet of racehorses to satisfy the high energy demands of extreme exercise has been identified as a risk factor for intestinal dysfunction. In this study we use 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes to characterize the gut microbiome of 8 Thoroughbred (Tb) racehorses and study the response to dietary supplementation. Methods Faecal samples were collected from 8 Tb racehorses in training. A second sample was collected from all horses six weeks after commencement of twice daily dietary supplementation with an amylase-rich malt extract, designed to enhance pre-caecal digestion. Amplicons for the V1-V3 region of the 16S rDNA gene were multiplexed and sequenced on the 454 resulting in ?25,000 reads per sample. Differences in bacterial community structure were detected by linear discriminant analysis. Results Communities were composed of an equal balance between Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes with a ?5% contribution from other bacterial phyla. The number of observed operational taxonomic units sharing ≥97% nucleotide sequence in our racehorse population was 6000?8000. Horses showed no significant change in the number of OTUs observed after diet supplementation, but significant changes in the relative abundance of both Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes families were observed. Conclusions We demonstrated a highly diverse and complex faecal microbial community in Tb racehorses in the UK. Inter-horse variability is low amongst horses in the same training yard. We identified significant shifts in community profile following dietary supplementation and speculate that these may enhance intestinal health.

AB  - Introduction Repeated monitoring of faecal pH may be useful in detecting the effects of exercise and conditioning on the fermentative activity within the large intestine. This study investigated the effect of a maximal incremental exercise test (MIET) and aerobic conditioning on the faecal pH of untrained horses. Methods Fourteen equines were randomly divided into two experimental groups. The control group consisted of 7 horses that remained untrained. The second group underwent physical training (n?=?7). The trained equines underwent two MIETs, once before and once after exercise conditioning. The conditioning period lasted 6 weeks and consisted of 3 weekly sessions of exercising on a treadmill at 70% of lactate threshold. All horses were fed the same diet. To evaluate the effect of exercise on faecal pH, stool samples were collected before and 48?h after the MIETs (before and after training) for determination of fecal pH. To determine chronic effects, weekly stool sampling was performed at 0 (immediately before), 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 days of training. One-way repeated measures ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test, the paired t-test (MIET) and the unpaired t-test were performed for comparisons between the groups at the different times. Results Faecal pH decreased from day 28 in the trained horse group compared to controls. pH values were 7.57?±?0.10 and 7.27?±?0.24 (before) and 7.97?±?0.14 and 6.75?±?0.15 (after) for the control and trained groups respectively. There was no change in faecal pH after the MIET. Conclusions It appears that physical conditioning reduced faecal pH of horses.

AB  - Introduction The study of kinematic patterns of young jumping horses can help to improve selection. This study was carried out to predict free jumping success of young horses using logistic regression to model jumping kinematic variables. Methods 108 untrained young Brazilian Sport Horses of both genders were studied. Reflective skin markers were used to identify anatomical reference points. Five free jumps over a vertical obstacle (with a height of 60, 80 and 105?cm for age classes 22?25, 29?32 and 36?39 months, respectively) were recorded. A 100?Hz camera was used, and images were analyzed using Simi Reality Motion Systems?. Successful (n?=?1,030) and unsuccessful (n?=?200) jumps were analyzed and the following kinematic variables were preselected by principal components analysis and then used as independent variables: last stride length prior to jumping, jumping velocity, take-off distance, withers displacement at jumping, forelimb height at jumping, vertical distance between scapulohumeral and metacarpophalangeal joints, scapulohumeral, radial-metacarpal, tibiometatarsal and withers-fetlock angles. Results The effects of take-off distance, forelimb height at jumping and jumping velocity on the jumping result were significant (P?=?0.0091). An increment of one centimeter in take-off distance and forelimb height led to an increase in the probability of success by 2.6% and 10.6%, respectively. An increase of one meter per second in jumping velocity led to a reduction in the probability of success by 27.8%. Conclusions Jumping success is influenced by take-off distance, jumping velocity and forelimb flexibility. Selection of young horses for superior jumping capacity can be aided by kinematic analysis, which may shorten training time and improve performance.

AB  - Introduction The development of miniaturized inertial sensor technology (IMU) opens new possibilities to assess equine back motion in real-life situations. The consistency of IMU for measuring dorsoventral displacement of the back has been assessed but orientation has not. The aim of this study was to assess accuracy and consistency of miniaturized inertial sensors for quantification of flexion-extension of the equine back, compared to motion capture (mocap) as a gold standard. Methods One sound horse was trotted (3.5?m/s) and cantered (9?m/s) on a treadmill with synchronized mocap and IMU data collection. The amplitudes of two flexion-extension angles were calculated between 3 IMUs (T12-T16-L2) and with a triad of markers linked to each IMU during 15 consecutive strides for two recordings at each gait. Consistency of sensor measurements was assessed using Lin correlation coefficient. Results Thoracic and thoracolumbar angles showed respectively a Lin correlation coefficient of 0.96 (excellent) and 0.87 (good). The difference (mean?±?SD) between IMU and mocap were, respectively for the thoracic and thoracolumbar angles, 0.57?±?0.44 and 0.65?±?0.47 degrees during trotting, and 0.83?±?0.67 and 0.63?±?0.44 degrees during canter. Conclusions Angle values calculated with IMU data showed acceptable accuracy consistency for quantification of flexion-extension movement in a horse's back. These results are encouraging for future development of the method in real-life situations where mocap systems are unsuited for the quantification of back movements.

AB  - Introduction Requirements of competitive dressage should be reviewed periodically to inform training of horses and judges. The aim of this study was to determine whether features of the FEI definition of piaffe are achieved in competition and to correlate the judges? scores with the degree of conformity to the definition. Methods Videography (60?Hz) of 3 piaffe strides (performed at marker D within a field of view 6?x?4?m) from 60 Grand Prix horses was used to measure croup height (CH), poll height (PH), the highest point of the neck (PN), peak height of the fore (FTpeak) and hindlimb toe (HTpeak), the level of a point half way down the cannon (MC) and the level of the fetlock joint (FJ) to within?±?0.01?m. Paired t-tests were used to compare CH in piaffe with that in halt, PH with PN, FTpeak with MC and HTpeak with FJ during piaffe to determine if the criteria within the definition were met. Piaffe scores from 5 judges were obtained from a subset of 17 horses. Results CH was higher in piaffe than in halt (P<0.001). PN was higher than PH in piaffe (P?=?0.001). FTpeak was lower than MC (P?=?0.001) and HTpeak was lower than FJ (P?=?0.001). There was no significant difference (P?=?0.836) between the scores awarded to each horse but also no correlation between the scores and PH (P?=?0.331), CH (P?=?0.829), FTpeak (P?=?0.784) or HTpeak (P?=?0.924). Conclusions Piaffe performed in competition does not conform to the FEI definition of the movement although judges? scores appear consistent. This finding suggests that the definition of the movement or judge training should be reviewed. Ethical Animal Research Project approved by Hartpury College Research Ethics Committee.

AB  - Introduction Numerous oral joint supplements are available, but there is limited research into their efficacy. This study evaluated the effect of an oral joint supplement on orthopaedic evaluation scores and limb kinematics in horses. Methods 24 mature horses (71% 1?4/10 lame) were included. Exclusions were poor body condition, health problems, or lameness >4/10. Supplement S (FlexAbilityTM, Science Supplements, containing chondroitin sulphate 162?g/kg, glucosamine 190?g/kg, vitamin C 80?g/kg, methyl sulphonyl methane 256?g/kg, DHA 66?g/kg); EPA 34?g/kg; or placebo P (carrier/flavours only) were fed to horses for 21 days each in a random order triple-blind crossover design. Horses were evaluated at day 0 (baseline), 21 (after first treatment) and 42 (after second treatment). Clinical orthopaedic evaluation for straight line and lungeing circle (walk and trot), and during ridden exercise (walk, trot and canter) was performed. Side-view high-speed motion-capture (240?Hz) determined midstance tarsal flexion, carpal extension and fetlock extension for straight line trotting. All evaluators were blinded to treatment. Effect of treatment, sequence, limb and interactions were investigated using linear mixed models. Results S was associated with significantly lower lameness grade in a straight line (P?=?0.001) with individual horses improving up to 2/10 grades and circle (P?=?0.010) than either P or baseline. For horses with hindlimb lameness, supplement S was associated with significantly greater tarsal flexion than baseline (4.2% greater, P<0.02) or P (2.7% greater, P<0.037). Conclusions Oral administration of supplement S was associated with less lameness than P or baseline. Increased midstance tarsal flexion of lame limbs may indicate improved mobility or comfort during peak loading.

AB  - Introduction Pressure plate analysis has been limited to measurements on a hard surface, whereas horses routinely perform on a soft substrate. Methods Five sound unshod ponies were walked and trotted over a pressure plate under 2 different conditions: first, the plate was covered with a 5-mm rubber mat, and then with an additional 50-mm layer of sand/synthetic fibres. Peak vertical force (PVF), vertical impulse (VI), peak vertical pressure (PVP), contact area (CA) and stance duration (ST) were obtained. Toe-heel and medio-lateral hoof balance curves of the vertical force were calculated (126?Hz). Hard vs. soft surfaces were compared using ANOVA and Kruskall-Wallis test with pairwise comparisons. Results PVF, VI, PVP and ST decreased on the soft substrate, while CA increased (P<0.001). At impact, there was more even load distribution between the toe and heel region on the soft vs. hard surface, both at walk (P<0.001) and trot (P?=?0.039), and between the lateral and medial zone at walk (P?=?0.006), but not at trot. At mid-stance, there was more loading of the toe region on the soft vs. hard surface at walk (P?=?0.044) and at trot (P?=?0.005), while the medial and lateral zone were loaded equally. Conclusions The differences observed may be due to dampening effects, measurement errors or gait adaptations. Due to the lack of simultaneous force plate data this cannot be definitively identified, but the first option seems most likely. This study opens perspectives for evaluation of the effects of conformational deficits and therapeutic farriery on hoof loading in relation to arena composition.

AB  - Introduction Manipulation of the equine ilium and sacrum is utilised to assess range of motion at the SIJ. Motion of the ilium and sacrum during manual force application to the equine pelvis has been measured previously in vitro. The aim of this study was to measure the amount and direction of motion in vivo including comparison of bone fixated and skin mounted sensors. Methods Orientation sensors were skin-mounted over tuber sacrale (TS) and 3rd sacral spinous process (SP) of six standing Thoroughbred horses. Orientations of each TS and sacrum were recorded by one investigator during six trials of manual force applied to the pelvis, inducing cranial, caudal and oblique rotations. The study was repeated with the sensors mounted onto pins implanted into TS and SP. Mean values were reported in Euler angles for the three orthogonal planes lateral bend (LB), flexion-extension (F-E) and axial rotation (AR). Correlation between skin and bone fixated markers (Spearman R) was determined with significance set at P<0.05. Results The largest mean values recorded during rotations applied to the pelvises were for F-E (2.08?±?0.35o) with bone fixated sensors. Axial rotation gave the largest values recorded with skin-mountings (1.70?±?0.48o). There was poor correlation between skin-mounted and bone implanted markers. Conclusions Bony kinematics during external movement applied to the pelvis cannot be predicted from skin-mounted sensors, due to differences between skin- and bone-mounted sensors. Manipulation of the equine pelvis can be expected to produce motion in the plane of F-E, but axial movement should be interpreted with caution due to the potential effects of skin motion.

AB  - Introduction Asymmetry of the trot may occur or increase during endurance rides due to lameness, pain or fatigue. By visual inspection of the movement it is difficult for veterinarians, riders and researchers to distinguish between fatigue and low-grade lameness, which make objective movement analysis relevant for this purpose. The aim of this study was to determine changes in movement symmetry during long-term exercise. Methods Movement symmetry of 45 horses finishing endurance rides of 120?160 kilometres was determined by tri-axial accelerometry according to an earlier published method. Data was collected in Denmark and Germany from 5 international competitions between 2011 and 2013. Movement was assessed at trot on a straight-line in-hand on the day before the race and 30?mins to 3?hrs after passing the final veterinary examination. An overall symmetry index S was calculated on the basis of trunk accelerations measured at 240?Hz during 8 strides. All trotting sequences were recorded on videotape. A paired t-test was performed comparing symmetry indices before and after racing for each individual horse. Results A significant decrease in post-ride symmetry was detected (P?=?0.0042). This is seen as a lower S-index before racing (-6.18; SD?=?0.86. CI [-6.427; ?5.923]) compared to after racing (-5.67; SD?=?0.79; CI [-5.908; ?5.434]). Conclusions This study indicates that the biomechanical method applied allows quantification of the symmetry of movement during field conditions. Most horses had decreased movement symmetry after the race. Accordingly the study provides the basis for further investigation of the causes, including surface, climate and fitness; and the possible health consequences of asymmetric movement developed during long-term exercise.

AB  - Introduction Mangalarga Marchador (MM) is the most important Brazilian horse breed. Functional evaluation of MM horses is performed in marcha competitions, where horses must perform 4-gaited exercise at 13?km/h for 70?min. The aim of this work was to test a training protocol to prepare MM horses for marcha competition. Methods Eight untrained MM mares, in randomized blocks with Split plots, were trained for 84 days. Three days/week horses were ridden for one hour (10?min walk, then an individual amount of marcha exercise at 13?km/h established in a previous test, then walk to complete one hour total exercise time). Two days/week, horses walked for one hour. Before training and every 21 days a marcha test (MT) was performed, totaling 5 tests in the experimental period. During the MT, mares were exercised at 13?km/h using a heart rate monitor. Every 10?min heart rate (HR) and blood lactate concentration [La] were recorded. The MT was stopped at 70?min of exercise, or if HR was ≥150?bpm and [La] was ≥4?mmol/L, or if Marcha Time was reached. Blood samples for hemogram, lactate, glucose, triglyceride and CK, LDH, AST determination were collected. Individual time used for training was 10?min less than the exercising time in the previous MT. Regression was used to analyze the results. Results From MT 1 to 4, the positive effect of training was shown on HR, [La] and marcha time (from 9.52?min to 70.5?min, CV?=?26.41). There was not an increase in marcha time on test 5. Conclusions MM mares trained for 63?days with the described protocol are ready to compete in marcha competition.

AB  - Introduction Poll flexion may play an important role in the development of dynamic upper respiratory tract (URT) collapse. However, limited investigations have been performed in Standardbred racehorses. Methods Eight Standardbreds were examined during training, once flexed and once in extension, using a randomised crossover design. Head position was maintained using modified check-reins and head-neck angle was recorded. On each occasion horses performed 2 rounds of exercise of 2400?m at ?35?km/h. Speed and heart rate (HR) were measured and blood obtained before and after exercise. URT endoscopy was performed during the second round. Videos were blinded and URT function assessed. HR, plasma lactate (Lac) and speed were compared for different head positions using paired t-tests. Cortisol was analysed using repeated-measures ANOVA and URT function using Fisher's exact tests and paired t-tests (P<0.05). Results Data were excluded for one horse where head-neck angle could not be measured. Flexed and extended head-neck angles differed significantly (mean: 85.0° vs 97.8°; P?=?0.001). All horses showed some form of URT collapse during exercise, although this was only deemed clinically significant in 4 horses with a history of abnormal noise. These horses showed additional abnormalities during flexion. However, mean severity scores did not reach statistical significance (P?=?0.08). No significant difference was found for speed, HR or Lac. A significant increase in cortisol was found with exercise (P<0.001). The interaction between time and head position approached significance (P?=?0.09) with higher concentrations of cortisol generally occurring in extension rather than flexion. Conclusions URT abnormalities may be exacerbated with poll flexion. The use of equipment to modify head position may induce a stress response.

AB  - Introduction Healthy and poorly performing horses can display arrhythmias during exercise and immediately afterwards. The relationship of arrhythmias to exercise intensity or type, and their frequency of recurrence, are poorly understood. Clarification of these issues was the objective of this investigation. Methods Electrocardiograms were recorded on 9 Thoroughbreds during maximal and submaximal exercise on a racetrack (RA) and treadmill (TM). The frequency of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias for RA and TM were compared using Fisher's Exact Test. Results 65 workouts (TM?=?46, RA?=?19; median[range]: 4/horse[2?14]) were performed. Exercising arrhythmias were detected in 4/9 horses (12/65 workouts) and there were post-exercise arrhythmias in 7/9 horses (20/65 workouts). A single exercising electrocardiogram per horse often did not display all arrhythmias detected over several workouts. 3/9 horses exhibited arrhythmias during the first and second runs while the other 6 had none. 4/9 had 1 post-exercise arrhythmia. Of 6 horses with >3 runs, 1 displayed arrhythmias each time, 3 never had arrhythmias and 2 sometimes showed arrhythmias during exercise (1/9 and 4/8 workouts, respectively). All 6 intermittently had post-exercise arrhythmias (median[range]: 50% [9?75%] of workouts). Presence of arrhythmias was positively related to intensity and all occurred at ≥94%HRmax. The frequency of arrhythmias following RA (29%) and TM (12.5%) was not statistically different. Conclusions Gallops on TM or RA were equally effective for detecting arrhythmias. The presence/absence of exercising arrhythmias was more repeatable than post-exercise arrhythmias. Arrhythmias are more likely to be detected at maximal or near-maximal intensities. A larger population needs to be studied before firm conclusions are drawn. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol.

AB  - Introduction Previous research suggests stalling may have a negative influence on bone mineral content (BMC). Yet slow, long-distance exercise has not been successful in improving BMC compared to free-choice exercise. Still, it is a common practice to stall horses with light exercise and minimal turnout. We hypothesized stalled horses, despite ?weekend? turnout and light exercise, would have lower estimated BMC compared to pasture turnout. Methods Thirteen mature horses were split into two groups, Control (C, n?=?6) and Stalled (S, n?=?7). Digital radiographs were taken of the third metacarpal for estimation of BMC by radiographic bone aluminum equivalence (RBAE). After a 42-d period (P1) additional radiographs were taken and S-horses stalled for 4-d (receiving light under-saddle exercise), followed by 72-h pasture turnout. This pattern repeated for an additional 42-d (P2) followed by radiographs. Radiographs were analyzed for optical density of bone cortices and total BMC compared to an aluminum step-wedge on each cassette. Changes in BMC were analyzed using PROC mixed in SAS with repeated measures. Results No treatment differences were observed in the medial (P?=?0.72) or lateral (P?=?0.46) cortices. Dorsal and palmar cortices exhibited a treatment by period interaction (P<0.01, P<0.02), remaining unchanged in C but S decreased over P1 and returned to baseline in P2. Total RBAE was not different by treatment or period. Conclusions Contrary to our hypothesis, horses stalled with light exercise and ?weekend? turnout maintained BMC compared to themselves and controls at pasture. Such management may be considered for maintaining BMC when horses must be stalled for weekday riding or training. Further research is necessary to determine minimum turnout and exercise needs to maintain BMC when stalling.
