AB  - Background:?? Necrotising fasciitis is a soft tissue infection with progressive tissue necrosis, affecting the deep fascial layers. It is a rare life-threatening disease with mortality rates from 6.1?43%. Many factors have been associated with increased mortality. The aim of this study is to re-evaluate these factors by analysing data from a larger patient series than any presented in the published literature to date. Methods:?? The medical records of 151 sequential patients with necrotising fasciitis treated in the Alfred Hospital from 1997?2004 were reviewed to identify the factors associated with increased mortality. The data was then analysed with multivariate analysis to identify the statistically significant factors. Results:?? Mortality rate of this study was 11.3%. The statistically significant factors were CRP > 200 on admission (p = 0.018), mechanical ventilation on admission (p = 0.002), older age (p = 0.0231), male (p = 0.013), delayed hyperbaric therapy from first symptoms (p = 0.045), spontaneous precipitant (p = 0.015), and complications of multi organ failure (p = 0.006), acute renal failure (0.011), acidosis (p = 0.001) or atrial fibrillation (p = 0.001), sepsis (p = 0.045). Conclusions:?? The knowledge of these factors will assist in the management of necrotising fasciitis by prioritising these patients, allocating more appropriate resources to prevent delay in hyperbaric treatment and by promptly treat the disease, especially in ICU setting to prevent complications and improve survival.

AB  - Abstract Objective To determine changes in urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin concentration (uNGAL) in anaesthetized Greyhound dogs that developed acute tubular damage following haemorrhage and resuscitation with colloid-based fluids. Study design Prospective experimental study. Animals Seven healthy adult entire male Greyhound dogs. Methods During isoflurane anaesthesia, approximately 50 mL kg?1 of blood was removed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≤40 mmHg for 1 hour followed by gelatin-based colloid administration to maintain MAP ≥60 mmHg for 3 hours. Data, including oxygen extraction ratio and uNGAL, were collected before (T0) and immediately following (T1) haemorrhage, and hourly during reperfusion (T2?T4). After T4, dogs were euthanized and renal tissue was collected for histology. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated-measures one-way anova. Data are presented as means (95% confidence interval). Results Histology identified renal tubular epithelial damage in all dogs. Urine NGAL concentration increased from 12.1 (0?30.6) ng mL?1 at T0 to 122.0 (64.1?180.0) ng mL?1 by T3. Compared with T0, uNGAL was significantly higher at T3 (p = 0.016) and was increased 24-fold. Conclusions and clinical relevance Despite wide individual variation in baseline uNGAL, increases in uNGAL were observed in all dogs, suggesting that this biomarker has the potential to detect renal tubular injury following haemorrhage-induced hypotension and colloid-mediated reperfusion.

AB  - Fifty cases (36 dogs and 14 cats) with a confirmed diagnosis of pyothorax were evaluated from five referral institutions in the UK and Ireland. Aetiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of all cases were examined. The underlying cause of pyothorax was determined in 18 per cent of cases. Positive bacteriological cultures of the pleural fluid were obtained in 68·7 per cent of the animals. Treatment modalities included surgery and medical management, involving thoracostomy tube placement, thoracic aspiration, thoracic lavage and antimicrobial therapy. A successful outcome was achieved in 86 per cent of patients.

AB  - The influence of some environmental factors and some protecting substances were tested in a laboratory trial with healthy coronary horn and compared with specimens of damaged horn from the bearing border, which had been submitted to a faeces-urine medium. Hoof horn of the best quality from the middle zone of coronary horn (3?4?cm distal of the coronary band) was submitted to different organic media or to some hoof horn varnishes or to heat. The horn specimens of defined size were treated for 36?days with urine, faeces and urine, urea, faeces or faeces and biotine and their strength was compared with untreated controls. The mentioned excrements were collected from horses. The second group comprised some hoof varnishes or hoof-conditioners (Horsepan, Isohoof Protect, Krealit, Pedalo) and were kept for 24?h in these media. The influence of heat was tested after the horn specimens were heated in an oven for 5?min to 125°C. The results of histologically unchanged horn were compared to horn specimens of the bearing border, where frequently histological changes such as microcracks occur. Two groups of 20 specimens from the bearing border were treated with a mixture of faeces and urine for 5?weeks, and their tensile strength was compared to the same number of untreated controls. The tensile strength of unchanged coronary horn remained nearly unchanged or was only slightly diminished when it was treated with the different media. The treatment with heat did not reduce the tensile strength or showed even a slight increase compared to untreated specimens. The tensile strength of bearing border specimens showed a highly significant decrease of tensile strength of about 55% after 5?weeks treatment with faeces-urine in both trials compared to the untreated controls. The results indicate that unchanged horn is much more resistant to environmental factors than bearing border horn with first damages. For prevention of severe changes at the bearing border horses should not stand for a long time in beddings with a high content of faeces and urine.

AB  - Abstract Life-history theory concerns the trade-offs that mold the patterns of investment by animals between reproduction, growth, and survival. It is widely recognized that physiology plays a role in the mediation of life-history trade-offs, but the details remain obscure. As life-history theory concerns aspects of investment in the soma that influence survival, understanding the physiological basis of life histories is related, but not identical, to understanding the process of aging. One idea from the field of aging that has gained considerable traction in the area of life histories is that life-history trade-offs may be mediated by free radical production and oxidative stress. We outline here developments in this field and summarize a number of important unresolved issues that may guide future research efforts. The issues are as follows. First, different tissues and macromolecular targets of oxidative stress respond differently during reproduction. The functional significance of these changes, however, remains uncertain. Consequently there is a need for studies that link oxidative stress measurements to functional outcomes, such as survival. Second, measurements of oxidative stress are often highly invasive or terminal. Terminal studies of oxidative stress in wild animals, where detailed life-history information is available, cannot generally be performed without compromising the aims of the studies that generated the life-history data. There is a need therefore for novel non-invasive measurements of multi-tissue oxidative stress. Third, laboratory studies provide unrivaled opportunities for experimental manipulation but may fail to expose the physiology underpinning life-history effects, because of the benign laboratory environment. Fourth, the idea that oxidative stress might underlie life-history trade-offs does not make specific enough predictions that are amenable to testing. Moreover, there is a paucity of good alternative theoretical models on which contrasting predictions might be based. Fifth, there is an enormous diversity of life-history variation to test the idea that oxidative stress may be a key mediator. So far we have only scratched the surface. Broadening the scope may reveal new strategies linked to the processes of oxidative damage and repair. Finally, understanding the trade-offs in life histories and understanding the process of aging are related but not identical questions. Scientists inhabiting these two spheres of activity seldom collide, yet they have much to learn from each other.

AB  - Summary Parenteral nutrition is advocated for sick foals and horses, although there is no report which has critically evaluated its benefits in this species. Therefore, the hypothesis that parenteral nutrition (PN) is beneficial for horses with severe gastrointestinal disease was investigated in a retrospective study. Records from 79 treatment courses in horses with gastrointestinal disease were reviewed for the years 1992?2000. The fatality rate (48.1%) was attributed to the severity of the primary disease. Complications due to PN were recorded and hyperglycaemia was the most common complication associated with PN. The number of laparatomies, proportion of horses that received lipid emulsion and the daily cost were higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors. The length of PN course was longer in survivors, although glucose peak was observed later in nonsurvivors after initiation of PN. The content of vitamins in PN solution and plasma protein at the beginning of PN were higher for survivors, while the volume of plasma administered was significantly larger in nonsurvivors. In horses with inflammatory diseases, the rate of glucose infusion and the amount of vitamins administered were higher than in horses with nonstrangulated obstruction. The proportion of horses that received lipid emulsion was higher among those with nonstrangulated and strangulated obstruction than in the group with inflammatory conditions. Because of the diverse group of diseases and the variability in the clinical signs, evaluating the effect of PN on disease outcome was not possible. A prospective study to compare horses with similar clinical conditions treated and not treated with PN is needed to evaluate fully the benefits of PN, and to establish guidelines for patients election for PN.

AB  - Ammonia was necessary for the origin of life. However, NH3 would not have been a significant component of the neutral or mildly reducing (N2, CO2, H2O) atmosphere which characterized the Hadean earth (>3·8 Gyr ago), especially in view of the u.v. lability of NH3, the greater u.v. output of the young sun than pertains today, and the absence of an atmospheric u.v. screen. Heterogeneous phase reactions, following atmospheric chemistry, have been proposed as a prebiotic NH3 source. Lightning, or bolides (meteorites and comets), generated NOx., and Fe2+ in the sea could have reduced NO2? resulting from the NOx. to NH4+; this disequilibrium NH4+ level could have supported the production of the nitrogenous organic building blocks of life. NOx. and NHy thus could both have had important roles in the origin and evolution of life. Burgeoning biota could soon have depleted abiotically generated NH4+, and biological N2 fixation could have evolved in its present Fe-demanding, O2-sensitive forms in the Archaean O2-free, Fe2+-rich environment. Organic matter could have driven biological denitrification reactions based on NO2? and NO3? generated abiologically using some redox components which evolved in earlier chemolithotrophs and photolithotrophs, regenerating atmospheric NOx. and producing N2O. Any atmospheric NH3 leaking from oceanic biology would have been subject to u.v. breakdown and rain-out. Although O2-evolving photosynthesis probably began in the Archean some 3·5 Gyr ago, any O2 accumulation was local until 2·0 Gyr ago (Proterozoic) due to consumption by oxidation of Fe2+ and S2?. However, localized O2 accumulation before 2·0 Gyr ago could account for the observed early evolution of cytochrome oxidase and the possibility of O2-consuming chemolithotrophic and chemoorganotrophic nitrification, with further possibilities of NOx. production. Oxygen accumulation globally from 2·0 Gyr onwards coincided approximately with the evolution of eukaryotes, which contributed phagotrophy to the reactions of the N cycle as well as the nutrification-like aerobic production of NO. by nitric oxide synthetase, while lightning and bolides could now generate NO. from N2 and O2. Evidence for terrestrial ecosystems is found from 1·0 Gyr onwards; NOx. and NH3 generated by terrestrial biota stands a greater chance of escaping to the atmosphere than do these compounds generated in the sea where recycling within the water body is likely. As CO2 levels fell and O2 levels rose, NH3 cycling in the photorespiratory carbon oxidation cycle might have been evident as early as 1 Gyr ago, although this does not seem to be a major contributor to atmospheric NH3 today. Embryophyte evolution on land 450 Myr ago, together with symbionts and biophages, increased primary productivity and N cycling on land, with greater quantitative possibilities for NOx. and NH3 escape to the atmosphere. The evolution of lignin (and related phenylpropanoids) at least 400 Myr ago, with associated NH3 recycling in vascular land plant, does not seem (on present evidence) to increase NH3 loss to the atmosphere significantly. Biomass burning occurred at least 350 Myr ago with lightning as the likely ignition source; such burning yielded NO., NH3, N2O and N2 from organic N. As in earlier times, the existence of terrestrial embryophyte vegetation has been punctuated by major bolide impacts, with the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary impact generating perhaps 104 as much NO. as a year's thunderstorms do today, although the toxicity of NOx.per se to vegetation might not have been the major effect of the NOx. on biota. Terrestrial plants suffered fewer extinctions at this time than did many other major taxa. Despite such very significant generators of atmospheric combined N as major bolide impacts, the mean levels of NHy, NOx. and N2O (and O3) in the atmosphere during the 450 Myr existence of embryophyte vegetation was lower than the current, globally averaged, anthropogenically influenced values. Current globally averaged levels of atmospheric combined N are thus not without precedent in the history of life, globally for NOx., and locally for NHy, so vegetation has had evolutionary experience of high atmospheric combined N. However, this should not make us complacent about the impact of current wide-spread and continuing anthropogenic inputs of combined N, in view of the rate and extent of the inputs, and their combination with other aspects of local anthropogenic influence (e.g. SO2 from burning of high-S coal), stratospheric O3 depletion, and global environmental change (increasing CO2, temperature and sea-level).

AB  - Background Complications after microvascular surgery, such as partial flap loss, and arterial/venous compromise cannot only increase morbidity for the patient but also tax the healthcare system. Thrombocytosis, both essential and reactive, can predispose patients to thrombosis and hemorrhage and thus should intuitively have an effect on the outcome of microvascular free tissue transfers. We sought to evaluate the effect of preoperative thrombocytosis on outcomes after microvascular free flap surgery. Methods A retrospective review of the 2013?2016 American Collges of Surgeons, National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database identified 4,299 patients who had microsurgical flaps. Of these 3,744 had preoperative platelet levels recorded. Fifty-four patients had preoperative thrombocytosis, defined as a platelet count >450?K/CUMM, while 3,690 did not. The groups were compared; demographics, comorbidities, and smoking status were recorded. We then examined outcomes between groups including average operative time, length of hospital stay, need for transfusion, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) postoperatively, and need for reoperation. Results When comparing the two cohorts, there was no statistical difference in comorbidities. We found a significant difference between the thrombocytosis and control cohort in need for transfusion (29.6 vs. 12.8%, p =?.0002), average days till discharge (8.36 vs. 5.75, p =?.009), and need for reoperation (27.8 vs. 13.8%, p =?.003). There was no difference in DVT occurrence (0 vs. 0.1%, p =?.46) or average operation time (535?m vs. 482?min, p =?.088). Conclusion Patients with thrombocytosis undergoing microvascular free flaps are at increased risk for complications, including the need for a blood transfusion, prolonged hospital stays, and reoperation.

AB  - Lorazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine that interacts with a high degree of affinity for the GABA receptor complex. This high affinity binding in turn leads to a prolonged duration of action. There are no published clinical studies documenting its duration of action in dogs or its ability to control seizures. The purpose of this study was to compare the duration of seizure control of lorazepam with diazepam in 16 dogs presenting in status epilepticus or with active cluster seizures. Previous seizure history and anticonvulsant therapy was not a consideration for inclusion into this study. Animals were excluded if there was a known metabolic, toxic or traumatic cause of the seizure. Dogs were randomly assigned to receive either lorazepam (0.2?mg/kg IV) or diazepam (0.5?mg/kg IV), and the clinicians were blinded as to which drug they were administering. The duration of the study was 12 hours from the time of drug administration, and the animals were monitored for any indication of seizure activity, including generalized motor activity, focal motor activity (e.g., movement of facial or limb musculature) and change in the level of consciousness. The study ended at 12 hours post-study drug administration or when the dog seized before the end of the 12 hour study period. The results indicated no significant difference between lorazepam versus diazepam with regard to median seizure-free interval (2.8?h for diazepam versus 3.4?h for lorazepam, p=0.58 by log rank test), or with regard to percent seizure-free for the duration of the observation period (1/8 for lorazepam versus 3/8 for diazepam, p=0.51 by Fisher's exact test). There was also no difference between the 2 drugs regarding the number of animals in which seizures were initially controlled (6/8 in each group). Lorazepam used at this dose does not appear to result in a significant increase in duration of seizure control for dogs with status epilepticus and cluster seizures. Additional studies may be warranted using higher doses of lorazepam.

AB  - Abstract:  Objectives:? The aim of this study was to analyze short- and long-term results of liver transplantation (LT) in patients over 65?yr. Material and methods:? Between 1996 and 2004, 386 patients underwent 415 LT at our center. The main indication for LT was post-necrotic cirrhosis in 59%, followed by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) over cirrhosis in 33%. Half of the patients (53%) were hepatitis C virus (HCV) +. Overall, 72 patients were >65?yr of age. Actuarial survival, causes of mortality and postoperative complications were compared between groups: patients under and over 65?yr. Risk factors for poor outcome in patients over 65?yr were also analyzed. Results:? The older group had more patients at Child A stage, more HCC as an indication for LT and more HCV (+) patients, p?<?0.05. No differences were observed in donor and surgery characteristics, except for lower multi-transfusion and higher incidence of grafts with steatosis in the older group (p?<?0.05). Actuarial survival at one, three, five and 10 yr was 82%, 75%, 72%, and 70% for the <65?yr group vs. 77%, 66%, 55%, and 55% for the >65?yr group (p?=?0.03). Main causes of mortality in patients >65?yr were recurrence of underlying disease and medical causes. In the older age group, fewer infections (p?=?ns) and rejections (p?=?0.017) occurred in the postoperative period. Risk factor for poor outcome in the group of patients over 65?yr in multivariate analyses was pre-LT renal insufficiency (odds ratio 3.5, p?=?0.002, 95% confidence interval 1.58?7.82). Conclusion:? Results in patients >65?yr are comparable to those <65?yr if older LT candidates are carefully selected. Overimmunosuppression should be avoided in older candidates, as its effects could worsen the pre-existing diseases common in elderly patients.

AB  - On behalf of the ?Blood Matters? Planning Group. The Blood Matters Collaborative was structured around a series of specific projects designed to improve distinct aspects of the sequence of care processes that ultimately determine the safety of each and every fresh blood product (red cell, platelet, fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate) transfusion. These commence with the appropriateness of the clinical decision to transfuse blood products, then move to ensure that procedures for patient, sample and blood product identification and blood administration are robust and that any procedural errors and adverse events associated with transfusion are captured, analysed and acted upon. Finally and very importantly the collaborative sought to improve the patient and carers understanding of the risks and benefits of transfusion. It was an ambitious program of work but there seemed little alternative other than addressing all of the interdependent processes that determine the quality and safety of transfusion. All elements in this chain contribute to the actual levels of transfusion safety. With support from the Clinical Innovation Agency and planning group members, local multi-disciplinary hospital teams set out to deliver changes to improve transfusion safety. The collaborative methodology, initially developed by the Institute of Healthcare Improvement in the United States of America, has been adopted and used by a large number of health systems internationally and within Australia. It is based on answering three key questions [Q1. What are we trying to accomplish? Q2. How will we know that a change is an improvement? Q3. What changes can we make that will result in improvement?] and testing ideas through the plan, do, study, act cycles of change. Individual projects monitored progress using ?run charts? to record their measured performance. These indicated progress towards achieving locally set targets and collaborative improvement goals. Our objectives were translated into tangible benefits for patients requiring blood product transfusion. Fundamental to the collaborative approach to improving transfusion practice is the belief that changes can be tested rapidly on a small scale without risk. For example, an idea can quickly be tried with one patient, one clinic or ward, a single consultant or hospital. Only if it proved successful was it suggested for wider adoption as an improvement in care across an entire Health Service or system of care. Our successes reinforced the value of using a systematic method for translating ideas into practice such as that used by the collaborative. The governance structures and teams established during our participation in the collaborative have helped us to identify key local issues and implement strategies to enhance the quality of our transfusion services to our patients. Our aim is to ensure that the continued review and improvement of transfusion practices becomes an integral part of the way that clinical teams and hospital and health system clinical governance structures work. The role of state or national bodies is to support this to happen. We hope to build a series of improvement partnerships that all focus on optimising the quality of transfusion services and the outcomes of patients receiving transfusion during their clinical care.

AB  - Chicken egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) is a functional substitute for mammalian IgG for antigen detection. Traditional IgY purification methods involve multi-step procedures resulting in low purity and recovery of IgY. In this study, we developed a simple IgY purification system using IgY-specific peptides identified by T7 phage display technology. From disulfide-constrained random peptide libraries constructed on a T7 phage, we identified three specific binding clones (Y4-4, Y5-14, and Y5-55) through repeated biopanning. The synthetic peptides showed high binding specificity to IgY-Fc and moderate affinity for IgY-Fc (Kd: Y4-4 = 7.3 ± 0.2 ?M and Y5-55 = 4.4 ± 0.1 ?M) by surface plasmon resonance analysis. To evaluate the ability to purify IgY, we performed immunoprecipitation and affinity high-performance liquid chromatography using IgY-binding peptides; the result indicated that these peptides can be used as affinity ligands for IgY purification. We then used a peptide-conjugated column to purify IgY from egg yolks pre-treated using an optimized delipidation technique. Here, we report the construction of a cost-effective, one-step IgY purification system, with high purity and recovery. ? 2017 The Authors.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background and objective:? Many trace elements play important roles in activating or inhibiting enzymatic reactions, by competing with other elements and metalloproteins for binding sites, by affecting the permeability of cell membranes and by other mechanisms. They play important roles in the oxidant/antioxidant balance. As such, trace elements are thought to be involved directly or indirectly in the pathogenesis of several diseases. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect trace elements (Se, Mn and Zn) intravenously administered on the period the COPD patients spend on mechanical ventilation. Methods:? In a randomized double-blinded controlled trial a set of 120 subjects (40 normal volunteers and 80 COPD) were recruited. Serum concentration levels of Se, Mn and Zn were determined for all enrolled subjects with Inductively Coupled Plasma spectroscopy. COPD patients received intravenous supplementation of the above trace elements and the period the patients spent on mechanical ventilation was determined. Results:? There was a significant reduction (P?=?0.013) in the period the patients with COPD spent on the mechanical ventilation when received intravenous supplementation (9.4?±?7.3?days) compared with the COPD patients who received placebo (17.8?±?7.6?days). Conclusions:? Trace element (Se, Mn and Zn) status is altered in critically ill patients with COPD. The supplementation achieved a reduction in the period those patients spent on the mechanical ventilation. A larger multi-centre trial is required to confirm this preventive effect and to explore its applicability to other critical care conditions.

AB  - Home hemodialysis (HHD) is superior to in-center hemodialysis (ICHD) in terms of survival, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. However, assistance from family members in performing HHD is not always available to patients, and professional assistance for HHD can be cost prohibitive. For certain patients, ICHD can be impractical due to difficulties in transportation, which may necessitate ambulance transportation or hospitalization for in-hospital hemodialysis (IHHD). We describe 4 patients that have had problems receiving ICHD for various reasons. Two of these patients had problems with transportation, while the other two could not remain on dialysis for the prescribed duration of time and, therefore, received inadequate dialysis. These patients had difficulty while receiving ICHD in meeting the adequacy criteria set by Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative. One of these patients had a neuropsychiatric disorder and displayed disruptive behavior. When these 4 patients were switched to staff-assisted home hemodialysis (SAHD), the dialysis core indicators improved compared with ICHD, and the patients needed significantly fewer hospitalization days. In this paper, we demonstrate that, in patients that cannot be easily transferred, and in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, SAHD can be a less expensive and more efficacious modality of dialysis.

AB  - Abstract Paroxysmal movement disorders encompass varied motor phenomena. Less recognized features and wide phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity are impediments to straightforward molecular diagnosis. We describe a family with episodic ataxia type 1, initially mis-characterized as paroxysmal dystonia to illustrate this diagnostic challenge. We summarize clinical features in affected individuals to highlight underappreciated aspects and provide comprehensive phenotypic description of the rare familial KCNA1 mutation. Delayed diagnosis in this family is emblematic of the broader challenge of diagnosing other paroxysmal motor disorders. We summarize genotypic and phenotypic overlap and provide a suggested diagnostic algorithm for approaching patients with these conditions.

AB  - Abstract Background Subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis usually results from traumatic inoculation with the fungus and generally occurs in immunosuppressed men. Cladosporium, Exophiala, and Alternaria spp. are commonly implicated pathogens. Objectives We present a case of subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis caused by Rhytidhysteron sp. that was refractory to conventional antifungal therapy. Case report A 72-year-old man with hypertension and diabetes presented with a multiloculated, large cystic swelling over the right dorsal foot. Laboratory findings and x-rays of the chest and left foot were normal. Results Adequate control of the patient's diabetes was achieved, and the swelling was excised under itraconazole/terbinafine coverage. Histology showed multiple areas of neutrophilic abscess, epithelioid cells, foreign body giant cells, and multiple septate hyphae and yeast-like cells. Dematiaceous fungus was cultured but failed to produce spores. Sequencing of the isolate showed a match of > 99% with Rhytidhysteron rufulum. The patient demonstrated no response after one year of therapy with itraconazole/terbinafine. Weekly infiltration of the lesion with liposomal amphotericin B resulted in its complete resolution within 15 weeks. Conclusions Lesions of phaeohyphomycosis appear morphologically similar regardless of the organism implicated. Hence, their diagnosis rests entirely on the clinicopathological and microbiological presentation. Molecular studies may be required to identify a fungus if attempts to grow it in artificial culture media fail. Rhytidhysteron spp. are not known as pathogens in humans, and no treatment protocol exists. Intralesional amphotericin was highly effective in our patient and caused no systemic adverse effects. Voriconazole and posaconazole are effective against disseminated/visceral phaeohyphomycotic infections, but their efficacy against Rhytidhysteron spp. remains unstudied.

AB  - Abstract Aspartate N-acetyltransferase (Asp-NAT; EC 2.3.1.17) activity was found in highly purified intact mitochondria prepared by Percoll gradient centrifugation as well as in the three subfractions obtained after the sucrose density gradient centrifugation of Percoll purified mitochondria; citrate synthase was used as a marker enzyme for mitochondria. The proportion of recoverable activities of Asp-NAT and citrate synthase were comparable in mitochondrial and synaptosomal fractions but not in the fraction containing myelin. Asp-NAT was solubilized from the pellet of the rat brain homogenate (26?000 g for 1?h) for the recovery of maximum activity and partially purified using three protein separation methods: DEAE anion exchange chromatography, continuous elution native gel electrophoresis and size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography. Asp-NAT activity and the optical density pattern of the eluted protein from size-exclusion column indicated a single large protein (?670?kDa), which on sodium dodecyl sulfate?polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed at least 10 bands indicative of an enzyme complex. This seemingly multi-subunit complex Asp-NAT was stable towards ionic perturbations but vulnerable to hydrophobic perturbation; almost 95% of activity was lost after 10?mm 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonia]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) treatment followed by size-exclusion chromatography. Asp-NAT showed an order of magnitude difference in Km between l-aspartate (l-Asp, ?0.5?mm) and acetyl CoA (?0.05?mm). Asp-NAT showed high specificity towards l-Asp with 3% or less activity towards l-Glu, l-Asn, l-Gln and Asp-Glu. A model on the integral involvement of NAA synthesis in the energetics of neuronal mitochondria is proposed.

AB  - Summary This chapter deals with those syndromes whose primary symptomatology is characterized by acquired impairments in one or more cognitive domains. Under DSM-5, these syndromes are collectively referred to as the ?Neurocognitive Disorders.? In the chapter, under ?Major Neurocognitive Disorder,? the syndromes of dementia and amnestic disorder are treated separately. After treating delirium, major neurocognitive disorder (including dementia and amnestic disorder), and minor neurocognitive disorder, the chapter turns to a number of disorders, each considered in DSM-5, which, if merely mild, may cause a minor neurocognitive disorder and which, if more severe, may cause a major neurocognitive disorder. These disorders include: Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Lewy body disease, vascular disease, traumatic brain injury, substance-induced neurocognitive disorders (e.g., alcoholic dementia), HIV infection, prion diseases (e.g., Creutzfeldt?Jakob disease), Parkinson's disease and, finally, Huntington's disease.
