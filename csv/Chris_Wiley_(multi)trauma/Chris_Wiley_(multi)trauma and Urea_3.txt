AB  - A 16-year-old male was transported to our emergency department after he was kicked in the abdomen by a horse. He was diagnosed with injury of the liver and abdominal rectus muscle, and was cured by observational treatment. An Ichushi search was undertaken to identify articles published from 1983 to 2013 using the key words ?horse? and ?trauma?. We found 13 cases that described horse-related injuries and summarized these cases, including our case. There were 10 males, three females and one patient of an undescribed sex. The patients ranged in age from 16 to 58 years old, with an average age of 33 years. The injured sites were predominantly the face (mandible) and upper abdomen, indicating that a projecting part of the body may be more likely to be injured. Cardiac rupture, aortic head injury, or lethality induced by a horse kick have not been reported in Japan, but such injuries have been reported in other countries. Ten of 15 cases (67%) required surgical treatment for severe injuries. Horse kick injuries tend to be severe, because the transfer of energy from the end of the hoof, with a small cross-sectional area, to a small field, leads to internal organic injuries that are more severe than predicted, similar to a handlebar injury. Accordingly, we advocate the close observation of patients with horse kick injuries, which may be regarded as being similar to blunt stab wounds or hidden speared injuries.

AB  - Introduction:? Lactoferrin (Lf), an iron-binding salivary glycoprotein, plays an important role in human innate defense against local mucosal infection. We hypothesized that Lf interferes with initial oral bacterial attachment to surfaces by iron sequestration, so inhibiting subsequent biofilm formation. The objective was to investigate the effect of Lf on the early stages of single-species and multi-species oral biofilm development. Methods:? Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis were used in this study. Glass disks of a two-track flow cell coated with flowing artificial saliva (0.3?ml/min) with and without Lf (100??g/ml) were used for studying bacterial attachment (3?h, 37°C). Attachment was also examined by incubating single or multiple species of test bacteria (107?colony-forming units/ml) with Lf-coated (20?100??g/ml) and uncoated glass slides. The effects of ?-lactoglobulin, 2,2?-dipyridyl (25?100??g/ml), an iron chelator, and FeCl3 on attachment were also examined. Results:? Lf inhibited the initial attachment of S. gordonii (50.3%, P?<?0.05) but not that of F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis. However, the attachment of a dual-species biofilm containing S. gordonii (i.e. S. gordonii/F. nucleatum or S. gordonii/P. gingivalis) was significantly reduced (48.7% or 62.1%, respectively, P?<?0.05) in the presence of Lf. ?-Lactoglobulin did not affect the attachment of S. gordonii. In the presence of 100??m 2,2?-dipyridyl, attachment of S. gordonii was reduced by 53.87%. No reduction in attachment was noted in S. gordonii pretreated with Lf (100??g/ml) and FeCl3 (20?200??m). Conclusion:? Lf suppresses initial attachment of S. gordonii and S. gordonii coaggregates by iron sequestration. This may lead to subsequent inhibition of oral biofilm development.

AB  - Abstract Multiple recent Sickle Cell Disease studies have been terminated due to poor enrollment. We developed methods to overcome past barriers and utilized these to study the efficacy and safety of intravenous magnesium for vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). We describe the methods of the Intravenous Magnesium in Sickle Vaso-occlusive Crisis (MAGiC) trial and discuss methods used to overcome past barriers. MAGiC was a multi-center randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of intravenous magnesium versus normal saline for treatment of VOC. The study was a collaboration between Pediatric Hematologists and Emergency Physicians in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN). Eligible patients were randomized within 12?hours of receiving intravenous opioids in the Emergency Department (ED) and administered study medication every 8?hours. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay. Associated plasma studies elucidated magnesium's mechanism of action and the pathophysiology of VOC. Health-related quality of life was measured. Site-, protocol-, and patient-related barriers from prior studies were identified and addressed. Limited study staff availability, lack of collaboration with the ED, and difficulty obtaining consent were previously identified barriers. Leveraging PECARN resources, forging close collaborations between Sickle Cell Centers and EDs of participating sites, and approaching eligible patients for prior consent helped overcome these barriers. Participation in the PECARN network and establishment of collaborative arrangements between Sickle Cell Centers and their affiliated EDs are major innovative features of the MAGiC study that allowed improved subject capture. These methods could serve as a model for future studies of VOCs. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2014;61:1049?1054. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Agriculture was and in most places still is, a disciplined life style that has bred strong character and high morals in virtually every culture. But such attributes are probably more the necessities of successful agriculture than its natural benefit. Modern agriculture, as practiced by Western cultures, is not the bucolic, healthful working environment fantasized in media classics such as Laura Ingalls Wilder's Farmer Boy. Whatever it was, agriculture is changing or facing change everywhere. While some cultures (and indeed some crops within all cultures) have yet to make the transition from human to animal to mechanized power, or from chemical to genetically engineered tools, where these transitions have occurred, production per farmer has increased. Unfortunately, so too have health and safety stresses upon farmers. Twenty years ago agriculture was the third most hazardous occupation. Although conditions within general industry improved during the intervening years, agriculture has been exempt of mandated safety and health services. Today agriculture is the most hazardous occupational group in the United States. In fact, modern farm life has recently been described as ?A Harvest of Harm.? This chapter hopes to address the needs and interests of industrial hygienists, as opposed to other reviews of agricultural hazards. It first describes the dilemma of agriculture as both an industry and as a way of life. Selected health hazards that are either characteristic of or unique to agriculture are then reviewed. A topical overview of hazardous processes, physical, biological and chemical agents, and diseases of concern in agriculture is given. The selected topics have been organized into acute and cumulative trauma, respiratory hazards, pesticides, veterinary chemicals, zoonoses, dermatoses, physical hazards, cancer, and mental stresses. The chapter concludes with a discussion of how the traditional industrial hygiene components of anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and control might be applied to agriculture, potential policies to stimulate industrial hygiene and safety services on the farm and ranch, and approaches employed in other countries to deliver such services. While the problems discussed are world wide, this chapter will focus on U.S. agriculture.

Clinical features Flumazenil was administered to two patients who were comatose following ingestion of benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants. Both suffered immediate convulsions and major cardiac toxicity. Interventions One patient received DC defibrillation and respiratory support, the other respiratory support and cardiopulmonary bypass. Outcomes Both patients required admission to the Intensive Care Unit. The patient requiring cardiopulmonary bypass died of multi-system failure, the other survived. Conclusions Flumazenil should not be used to reverse coma due to coingestion of benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants, or undifferentiated coma in which tricyclic antidepressant intoxication may be present.

AB  - Abstract Objective To evaluate the effect of intravenous infusion of amino acids on the prevention of hypothermia during anaesthesia in dogs. Study design Randomized experimental trial. Animals Seven healthy Beagle dogs. Methods Four concentrations of amino acids were prepared with a 10% amino acid solution and an acetated Ringer's solution, and dogs were infused with each of the solutions at 1 week intervals. Dogs were infused with amino acid solution at 12 mL kg?1 hour?1 for 60 minutes before and for 60 minutes after induction of anaesthesia. Acetated Ringer's solution was infused at the same rate for the remaining 60 minutes of anaesthesia. The infusion treatments were: 1) A0, nutrient-free acetated Ringer's solution; 2) A6, 0.6 g kg?1 hour?1; 3) A9, 0.9 g kg?1 hour?1; and 4) A12, 1.2 g kg?1 hour?1. Rectal temperature (RT), heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), blood insulin, glucose, urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine concentrations, and time to extubation were measured. Results Before anaesthesia, RT was not affected by amino acid infusion. RT decreased progressively during anaesthesia and the absolute values of RT from 30 to 120 minutes were significantly higher in A12 than in A0 (p < 0.05). Reductions in HR and MAP during anaesthesia were attenuated by amino acid infusion in a dose-dependent manner. Plasma insulin concentration was significantly higher in A12 than in A0 during amino acid infusion and the increase in insulin concentration was greater during than before anaesthesia. BUN increased during amino acid infusion in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Time until extubation was shorter in A12 than in A0. Conclusions and clinical relevance Amino acids infused at 1.2 g kg?1 hour?1 in dogs attenuated the decrease in RT, HR, and MAP during anaesthesia, and induced a significant increase in plasma insulin concentration.

AB  - Summary Monitoring the effectiveness of treatment is an essential part of the overall management of horses affected by a wide variety of abdominal conditions. Careful monitoring of gastrointestinal function is important so that the response to therapy can be assessed, and any derangements or deteriorations of gastrointestinal function can be identified and supportive therapy instituted rapidly. However, the critically ill patient may develop abnormalities and dysfunction of many organ systems in addition to the system affected by the primary disease. The result can be multi-organ dysfunction, and ultimately multi-organ failure, which is invariably fatal. It is important, therefore, that monitoring allows assessment of the function of all of the major organ systems, and not just gastrointestinal function. This monitoring includes repeated physical examinations and pain assessment, monitoring of temperature and pulse and respiratory rates, and collection of clinical pathological data. Accurate medical records are essential to monitor trends in an animal's response to treatment.

AB  - A 10-year-old male German shepherd dog was referred for evaluation of a cranial cervical mass causing progressively worsening respiratory distress. A fine-needle aspirate of the mass was obtained and the cytology results were compatible with a carcinoma. The dog underwent chemotherapy without clinical improvement and was ultimately euthanased because of clinical deterioration. At post-mortem examination, an irregular multi-lobated mass in the cranial cervical region was observed causing ventro-lateral tracheal deviation. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry revealed a mixed population of CD3 lymphocytes and macrophages in an exuberant fibrous stroma, associated with dispersed cytokeratin-positive epithelial cells with marked eosinophilic cytoplasm. Some of the epithelial cells were arranged in concentric clusters that were interpreted as Hassall's corpuscles. Histopathological examination of the thyroid gland revealed several neoplastic emboli composed of epithelial cells similar to those observed in the cervical mass. To the authors? knowledge, this is the first report of an ectopic cervical thymic carcinoma in a dog.

AB  - Summary The paramount aim of predictive toxicology in drug discovery and development is to assess the safety of drugs for use in humans. This chapter presents drug induced kidney injury as an example to illustrate the value and limitations of novel biomarkers by providing an overview of their (patho) physiological role and mechanistic link to toxicity, performance in experimental toxicity studies, approval by regulatory bodies, and application to preclinical decision making. Traditional markers of renal function such as serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) are inherently insensitive as they indicate kidney injury only when large amounts of the renal epithelium have been lost. The most widely studied urinary kidney biomarker is kidney injury molecule- 1 (KIM-1) encoded by the gene Havr1 (hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1). Advances in science and technology (e.g., microRNAs, next-generation sequencing) may also offer unique opportunities for the discovery of predictive biomarkers.

AB  - Background and Purpose Postoperative pain is one of the most common manifestations of acute pain and is an important problem faced by patients after surgery. Moreover, neuronal trauma or chemotherapeutic treatment often causes neuropathic pain, which induces disabling and distressing symptoms. At present, treatments of both painful conditions are inadequate. α-Spinasterol, which is well characterized as a transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 antagonist, has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antinociceptive effects. Therefore, we investigated its antinociceptive potential on postoperative and neuropathic pain, as well as its effect on COX-1 and COX-2 activities. Experimental Approach Nociceptive responses in a postoperative pain model (surgical incision-induced) or different neuropathic pain models (trauma or chemotherapy-induced) were investigated in mice. Key Results Oral administration of α-spinasterol reduced postoperative pain, when given as a pre- (0.5 h before incision) or post-treatment (0.5 h after incision), and reduced cell infiltration in the injured tissue. α-Spinasterol also reduced the mechanical allodynia induced by partial sciatic nerve ligation and the mechanical and cold allodynia induced by paclitaxel. Moreover, α-spinasterol inhibited COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme activities without altering the body temperature of animals. Importantly, α-spinasterol did not alter spontaneous or forced locomotor activity. Furthermore, it did not cause gastric damage or liver and kidney changes, nor did it alter cell viability in the cerebral cortex and spinal cord slices of mice. Conclusion and Implications α-Spinasterol is an effective and safe COX inhibitor with antinociceptive effects in postoperative and neuropathic pain models. Therefore, it is an interesting prototype for the development of novel analgesic drugs.

AB  - What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? The gold standard in the reconstruction of the defect urinary system is still the transplantation of autologous gastrointestinal segments although numerous different types of biomaterials (natural/synthetic) have been investigated as possible replacements. However, the ideal biomaterial is still not identified. In this study, we were able to identify the engineered collagen-based OptiMaix? scaffolds as promising biomaterials for the reconstruction of the urinary tract. OBJECTIVES ?? To analyse the in vitro cytocompatibility of several engineered collagen-based biomaterials for tissue engineering of the urinary tract. ?? Tissue-engineered implants for the reconstruction of the urinary tract are of major interest for urological researchers as well as clinicians. Although several materials have been investigated, the ideal replacement has still to be identified. MATERIALS AND METHODS ?? Several collagen matrices were tested. ?? Electron microscopy was used to visualize the microstructure of the tested matrices. ?? Examination of cell attachment and growth of primary porcine urothelial and smooth muscle cells were performed and cell phenotypes were analysed using immunohistochemical stains. ?? Urea permeability was investigated using Ussing chamber experiments. RESULTS ?? The best cytocompatibility for both urinary tract-specific cell types was obtained with OptiMaix? (Matricel GmbH, Herzogenrath, Germany) materials. ?? Cell-specific phenotypes were maintained during culture as shown by immunohistochemical staining. ?? Furthermore, simultaneous cultivation of both cell types for 7 and 14 days significantly reduced urea permeability. CONCLUSION ?? These results show the potential of OptiMaix materials in tissue engineering approaches of urinary tract tissues.

AB  - Severe trauma leads to considerable losses of nitrogen in the first days after the accident. As nutritional efforts cannot reduce these losses sufficiently, an adjunctive therapy using the anabolic steroid nandrolone decanoate (Nd) was applied. In a double-blind study 10 male multiple-traumatized patients each received 50 mg of Nd on day 3 and 25 mg of Nd on day 6 after the trauma, an additional 10 patients received placebo only. Both groups had identical nutritional support. Nitrogen balance, total nitrogen excretion as well as plasma amino acid concentration, and urine amino acid excretion were measured daily. The anabolic agent improved the nitrogen balance mainly by reducing nitrogen excretion. 3-Methylhistidine excretion and renal amino acid losses were decreased. Nandrolone decanoate increased the concentration of total plasma amino acids. The underlying principle seems to be an amino acid-saving mechanism with a renal site of action. It is shown that in the early posttraumatic period nandrolone decanoate improves nitrogen metabolism. Further studies are required to determine whether this offers a clinical benefit to trauma patients.

AB  - Introduction There is little information about biochemical and physiologic responses to exercise in Brazilian gaited horses. The aim of this study was to evaluate blood biomarkers and heart rate (HR) in gaited horses during a standardized gaited field test (SGT). Methods Sixteen horses performed a SGT (10?min warm-up, 30?min of marcha gait and 15?min recovery). Blood samples and HR were collected at rest, after warm-up, after 15 (F?+?15) and 30?min (F?+?30) of marcha, and after recovery. Assays were performed to measure glucose, lactate, total plasma protein, hematocrit, urea, creatinine, glutamine, glutamate, triglycerides, total cholesterol, Ca, P, Mg, Na, Cl and K. HR was measured using a HR monitor. Results were analyzed using one-way or two-way ANOVA. Post-hoc analyses included the Holm-Sidak test, Student's t-tests, and Pearson's correlation analyses. The null hypothesis was rejected when P<0.05. Results [Glucose] and [lactate] increased during SGT (P<0.05). A significant interaction between phase of SGT and fitness level was observed for [glucose] but not for [lactate]. The SGT also produced increases (P<0.05) in hematocrit, [TPP], [urea], [creatinine], [triglycerides], [P] and [K] and a reduction (P<0.05) in [Ca]. HR increased from ?47?bpm at rest, to ?140?bpm at F?+?15 and F?+?30 (P<0.05). Conclusions This study documents submaximal aerobic exercise, as performed during the GST is sufficient to alter energy biomarkers in gaited horses. Ethical Animal Research The study was approved by UFRPE's animal research committee (#62/2007-CTA/DZ/UFRPE). Sources of funding:?CAPES, IRCA Animal Nutrition and Cascatinha, Recanto da Serra, Annette and Abreu horse farms. Competing interests:?none.

AB  - Introduction Marcha is typically a low intensity/medium duration exercise that has the potential to induce oxidative stress. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that supplementation with oil would alter biomarkers of oxidative stress in four-beat gaited horses during marcha training. Methods Eleven gaited horses underwent training for 60?min (?60% consisting of marcha at ?3.5?m/s) 3?d/wk for eight weeks. Subjects were fed elephant grass (?15?kg/day) and concentrate (?5?kg/day). They were also supplemented with 300?mL of oil per os (vitamin E: 300?IU/kg, omega-3: 300?g/kg; omega-6: 80?g/kg) and had free access to water and salt. Blood samples were collected before and after four and eight weeks of supplementation for the measurement of GPx, SOD, RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, WBC, TPP, urea, creatinine and uric acid. ANOVA and Tukey tests were used for statistical analysis (P<0.05). Results Increases in GPx (?12%), SOD (?51%) and uric acid (?19%) were observed after 8 week of supplementation (P<0.05). There were changes (P<0.05) in [urea] and [creatinine]; however, there were no changes (P>0.05) in RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit or WBC. Published research has demonstrated that administration of supplements with antioxidants enhances the antioxidant system and protects against oxidative stress during exercise. Supplementation with oil, rich in vitamin E, omega-3 and -6, produced a beneficial increase in antioxidant capacity in gaited horses during training. Conclusions The elevation in [GPx], [SOD] and [uric acid] in the present study offers a strategy to counterbalance the physiologic processes that overwhelm endogenous antioxidants during training.

AB  - Donation after circulatory death (DCD) liver transplantation (LT) reportedly yields inferior survival and increased complication rates compared with donation after brain death (DBD). We compare 100 consecutive DCD LT using a protocol that includes thrombolytic therapy (late DCD group) to an historical DCD group (early DCD group n = 38) and a cohort of DBD LT recipients (DBD group n = 435). Late DCD LT recipients had better 1- and 3-year graft survival rates than early DCD LT recipients (92% vs. 76.3%, p = 0.03 and 91.4% vs. 73.7%, p = 0.01). Late DCD graft survival rates were comparable to those of the DBD group (92% vs. 93.3%, p = 0.24 and 91.4% vs. 88.2%, p = 0.62). Re-transplantation occurred in 18.4% versus 1% for the early and late DCD groups, respectively (p = 0.001). Patient survival was similar in all three groups. Ischemic-type biliary lesions (ITBL) occurred in 5%, 3%, and 0.2% for early DCD, late DCD, and DBD groups, respectively, but unlike in the early DCD group, in the late DCD group ITBL was endoscopically managed and resolved in each case. Using a protocol that includes a thrombolytic therapy, DCD LT yielded patient and graft survival rates comparable to DBD LT.

AB  - Summary While the exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying portosystemic encephalopathy may not be fully understood, management strategies are relatively well established. These include the identification and elimination of precipitating factors, in association with, or followed by, specific measures designed to reduce arterial ammonia levels. In many patients, liver transplantation may offer the only chance of effective management of this challenging clinical problem.

AB  - Objective? To identify preoperative diagnostic results that predict postoperative complications and survival in feline renal-transplant recipients. Study Design? Retrospective clinical study. Animals? Sixty-one feline renal allograft recipients. Methods? Medical records for 61 consecutive cats that underwent renal allograft transplantation between January 1, 1996, and December 1, 1999, were reviewed. Age, diagnosis, body weight, body condition score, preoperative medical treatment, systolic blood pressure, packed cell volume, biochemical parameters at admission and at the time of surgery, postoperative complications, and postoperative survival were recorded. Associations of preoperative data with the occurrence of postoperative complications were determined using logistic regression. Postoperative survival was graphed using a Kaplan-Meier cumulative-survival plot. Associations of covariates with postoperative survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards analysis. Results? Two parameters were significantly associated with occurrence of postoperative central nervous system (CNS) disorders: blood urea nitrogen concentration (odds ratio = 1.083; 95% CI = 1.018 to 1.148) and serum creatinine concentration (odds ratio = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.413 to 2.187) at the time of surgery. Postoperative survival 6 months after transplantation was 59%, though 3-year survival remained at 42%. Of all covariates investigated, only recipient age (relative hazard = 1.183; 95% CI = 1.039 to 1.334) was significantly associated with survival. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance? Standard measures of preoperative renal dysfunction do not predict postoperative survival in cats after renal transplantation, although an increase in the degree of preoperative azotemia is associated with an increased risk of CNS disorders after surgery. Increased recipient age is associated with decreased survival after renal transplantation.
