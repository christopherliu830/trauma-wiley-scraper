AB  - Biomedical textiles and fiber-based implants (BTFIs) have been in routine clinical use to facilitate healing for nearly five decades. Amongst the variety of biomaterials used, silk-based biomaterials (SBBs) have been widely used clinically viz. sutures for centuries and are being increasingly recognized as a prospective material for biomedical textiles. The ease of processing, controllable degradability, remarkable mechanical properties and biocompatibility have prompted the use of SBBs for various BTFIs for extracorporeal implants, soft tissue repair, healthcare/hygiene products and related needs. The present Review focuses on BTFIs from the perspective of types and physical and biological properties, and this discussion is followed with an examination of the advantages and limitations of BTFIs from SBBs. The Review covers progress in surface coatings, physical and chemical modifications of SBBs for BTFIs and identifies future needs and opportunities for the further development for BTFIs using SBBs.

AB  - Macroscopic anatomy of the heart is evaluated best in living animals, because postmortal changes and the lack of the normal heart motion lead to misinterpretation. For the last 15?years functional cardiac imaging of animals has been performed by two-dimensional ultrasonography. However, three-dimensional echocardiography has multiple advantages over two-dimensional ultrasonography such as an improved assessment of the endocardial structures and the possibility of precise determination of the sonographic views for measurement. For these reasons the ultrasound system SONOS 7500 of Philips has been used for examinations since December 2003. These examinations were performed in healthy adult dogs of different sizes as well as in European Short Hair cats. Using a recently developed multi-frequent matrix array probe all regions of interest were directly on-line volume-rendered or represented in two exactly defined orthogonal views. Although the used matrix array probe was large, transthoracic left and right parasternal sonograms could be carried out without any problems in all small animals without sedation. For the first time the cardiac structures in dogs and cats such as the opening and closing of the left atrioventricular and aortic valves were represented within a 60?degrees?(15 or 30?degrees pyramidal volume. The morphology and the function of the atrioventricular leaflets could be evaluated exactly. For representation of a larger pyramidal volume or the three-dimensional simultaneous colour flow imaging, careful ECG gating is required. Unfortunately, the distinct respiratory arrhythmia in quiet dogs had a negative effect on the registration of four or eight heart cycles of the same length. Using biplane echocardiography the commonly represented sonographs for measurement were exactly determined. Additionally these techniques enabled the registration of new views for evaluation and measurements, which were not available from two-dimensional ultrasonography. This study has demonstrated for the first time that real time transthoracic three-dimensional echocardiography is feasible in dogs and cats and that it provides comprehensive visualization of the intracardiac anatomy in unique projections in living animals.

AB  - Abstract Recent studies have suggested that changes in serum phosphate levels influence pathological states associated with aging such as cancer, bone metabolism, and cardiovascular function, even in individuals with normal renal function. The causes are only beginning to be elucidated but are likely a combination of endocrine, paracrine, autocrine, and cell autonomous effects. We have used an integrated quantitative biology approach, combining transcriptomics and proteomics to define a multi-phase, extracellular phosphate-induced, signaling network in pre-osteoblasts as well as primary human and mouse mesenchymal stromal cells. We identified a rapid mitogenic response stimulated by elevated phosphate that results in the induction of immediate early genes including c-fos. The mechanism of activation requires FGF receptor signaling followed by stimulation of N-Ras and activation of AP-1 and serum response elements. A distinct long-term response also requires FGF receptor signaling and results in N-Ras activation and expression of genes and secretion of proteins involved in matrix regulation, calcification, and angiogenesis. The late response is synergistically enhanced by addition of FGF23 peptide. The intermediate phase results in increased oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production and is necessary for the late response providing a functional link between the phases. Collectively, the results define elevated phosphate, as a mitogen and define specific mechanisms by which phosphate stimulates proliferation and matrix regulation. Our approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the cellular response to elevated extracellular phosphate, functionally connecting temporally coordinated signaling, transcriptional, and metabolic events with changes in long-term cell behavior.

AB  - Abstract Background and Aim:? To study the low-molecular-weight metabolites in blood plasma of patients with the progressive disease, gastric cancer, and to characterize different stages from chronic superficial gastritis (CSG) to chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), intestinal metaplasia (IM), gastric dysplasia (DYS) and finally gastric cancer (GC). Methods:? We applied gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/TOF-MS) to determine metabolites levels in plasma obtained from 80 patients including 19 with CSG, 13 with CAG, 10 with IM, 15 with DYS and 22 with GC (nine preoperation and 13 postoperation). Principal component analysis (PCA) and statistics were used to differentiate the stages and to identify the markers of gastric cancer. Results:? Totally, 223 peaks were detected in GC/TOF-MS and 72 compounds were authentically identified. CSG showed distinct difference from the other groups of CAG, IM, DYS and GC, whose plots clustered closely. IM clustered closely to GC, suggesting similar metabolic patterns of them. Fifteen identified metabolites contributed most to the differentiating between CSG and GC, and characterized different stages of GC. Statistics revealed elevated levels of 2-Hydroxybutyrate, pyroglutamate, glutamate, asparagine, azelaic acid, ornithine, urate, 11-eicosenoic acid, 1-monohexadecanoylglycerol and ?-tocopherol, while downregulation of creatinine, threonate in GC group, indicating that GC patients were obviously involved in oxidative stress, and perturbed metabolism of amino acids and fatty acids. Conclusion:? The metabolic phenotype of CSG is significantly different from GC, while that of IM is similar to it. The discriminatory metabolites characterizing progressive stages from CSG to GC might be the potential markers to indicate a risk of GC.

AB  - Abstract The anti-spreading activity of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) has been assigned to the C-terminal third domain, a region rich in α-helices. This ?extracellular calcium-binding? (EC) domain contains two EF-hands that each coordinates one Ca2+ ion, forming a helix-loop-helix structure that not only drives the conformation of the protein but is also necessary for biological activity. Recombinant (r) EC, expressed in E. coli, was fused at the C-terminus to a His hexamer and isolated under denaturing conditions by nickel-chelate affinity chromatography. rEC-His was renatured by procedures that simultaneously (i) removed denaturing conditions, (ii) catalyzed disulfide bond isomerization, and (iii) initiated Ca2+-dependent refolding. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopies demonstrated that rEC-His exhibited a Ca2+-dependent conformation that was consistent with the known crystal structure. Spreading assays confirmed that rEC-His was biologically active through its ability to inhibit the spreading of freshly plated human urothelial cells propagated from transitional epithelium. rEC-His and rSPARC-His exhibited highly similar anti-spreading activities when measured as a function of concentration or time. In contrast to the wild-type and EC recombinant proteins, rSPARC(E268F)-His, a point substitution mutant at the Z position of EF-hand 2, failed to exhibit both Ca2+-dependent changes in α-helical secondary structure and anti-spreading activity. The collective data provide evidence that the motif of SPARC responsible for anti-spreading activity was dependent on the coordination of Ca2+ by a Glu residue at the Z position of EF-hand 2 and provide insights into how adhesive forces are balanced within the extracellular matrix of urothelial cells. ? 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract. In its classic hormonal role, erythropoietin (EPO) is produced by the kidney and regulates the number of erythrocytes within the circulation to provide adequate tissue oxygenation. EPO also mediates other effects directed towards optimizing oxygen delivery to tissues, e.g. modulating regional blood flow and reducing blood loss by promoting thrombosis within damaged vessels. Over the past 15?years, many unexpected nonhaematopoietic functions of EPO have been identified. In these more recently appreciated nonhormonal roles, locally-produced EPO signals through a different receptor isoform and is a major molecular component of the injury response, in which it counteracts the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Acutely, EPO prevents programmed cell death and reduces the development of secondary, pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced injury. Within a longer time frame, EPO provides trophic support to enable regeneration and healing. As the region immediately surrounding damage is typically relatively deficient in endogenous EPO, administration of recombinant EPO can provide increased tissue protection. However, effective use of EPO as therapy for tissue injury requires higher doses than for haematopoiesis, potentially triggering serious adverse effects. The identification of a tissue-protective receptor isoform has facilitated the engineering of nonhaematopoietic, tissue-protective EPO derivatives, e.g. carbamyl EPO, that avoid these complications. Recently, regions within the EPO molecule mediating tissue protection have been identified and this has enabled the development of potent tissue-protective peptides, including some mimicking EPO?s tertiary structure but unrelated in primary sequence.

AB  - Abstract Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common male urogenital malignancy worldwide. Surgery, endocrine therapy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy are the main clinical management options for PCa. However, these three therapies each have limitations. For example, surgery is not suitable for the advanced PCa patients with extensive metastases, and radiotherapy causes serious side effects. Primary endocrine therapy promotes the progression of hormone-sensitive PCa into the castration-resistant prostate cancer. Therefore, considering these drawbacks, chemotherapy has become an effective and extensive treatment for PCa. Among the modern therapeutic strategies against advanced PCa, polymer-nanocarrier-incorporated formulations have gradually emerged due to their well-controlled release profiles and improved tumor targeting abilities. The drug delivery systems based on polymer nanoplatforms passively target tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention effect. Simultaneously, stimuli-responsive polymer nanoplatforms unload cargoes in response to certain stimuli in the tumor area. Furthermore, the active targeting ligand-conjugated polymer nanoformulations against PCa-specific markers have also achieved great success in PCa therapies. Herein, the advanced polymer nanoplatforms for PCa therapy are reviewed, while the future development of polymer nanoplatforms for PCa therapy is also predicted.

AB  - Summary Urogenital fistulae rarely occur congenitally but are most often acquired from obstetric, surgical, radiation, malignant and traumatic causes. Many urologists advocate an abdominal approach for all fistula repairs, claiming the possibility of earlier intervention and higher success rates in justification. Interposition grafts are often employed as an additional tissue layer during fistula surgery. Although small fistula repairs may be feasible using only local anaesthesia or local supplemented by sedation, most require general or regional anaesthesia; spinal anaesthesia is usual for vaginal fistula repairs in most low-resource countries. Repair by the abdominal route is indicated when a high fistula is fixed in the vault and inaccessible per vaginam or where proximity of the ureters to the fistula site is thought to put them at risk during vaginal repair. Urinary diversion is rarely required in the management of urogenital fistulae.

AB  - Summary Nutritional management of critically ill children (CIC) is a very specialist and challenging area in paediatric practice. A knowledge of metabolic changes and fuel utilisation during physiological stress can assist dietitians in commencing nutritional support at the appropriate time and suggesting a suitable feeding route and feed composition. Critical illness is characterised by a cascade of endocrine and metabolic reactions, affecting all major organs. During critical illness immune cells, e.g. macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils, regulate the inflammatory response through the release of cytokines and chemokines. Anthropometry, biochemical markers, clinical and dietary review form part of the nutritional assessment in CIC. This chapter describes the effect of nasogastric versus nasojejunal feeding and continuous feeds versus bolus feeding. A probiotics is a live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance.

AB  - Nutrition support is recognized as an important cofactor in altering morbidity and mortality of hospitalized patients. Paramount in delivering proper nutrition support is the accurate determination of baseline metabolic and nutritional status, thus influencing necessary protein requirements. After nutritional intervention, routine laboratory monitoring is used to measure the efficacy and to reassess metabolic stress level. Accurate determination of nitrogen excretion (and nitrogen balance) remains the standard in prescribing and monitoring the protein and nutritional treatment regimen. This article examines nitrogen excretion determinations in the clinical setting, including proper collection techniques, laboratory measurements, and analyses and their effect upon nitrogen balance studies.

AB  - Abstract Cartilage tissue engineering is a rapidly progressing area of regenerative medicine with advances in cell biology and scaffold engineering constantly being investigated. Many groups are now capable of making neocartilage constructs with some level of morphological, biochemical, and histological likeness to native human cartilage tissues. The application of this useful technology in articular cartilage repair is well described in the literature; however, few studies have evaluated its application in head and neck reconstruction. Although there are many studies on auricular cartilage tissue engineering, there are few studies regarding cartilage tissue engineering for complex nasal reconstruction. This study therefore highlighted the challenges involved with nasal reconstruction, with special focus on nasal cartilage tissue, and examined how advancements made in cartilage tissue engineering research could be applied to improve the clinical outcomes of total nasal reconstructive surgery.

AB  - Establishment of a preferential liver allocation rule for simultaneous liver and kidney transplantation (SLK) and revisions of laws regarding organ transplants from deceased donors have paved the way for SLK in Japan. Very few cases of SLK have been attempted in Japan, and no such recipients have survived for longer than 40 days. The present report describes a case of a 50-year-old woman who had undergone living donor liver transplantation at the age of 38 years for management of post-partum liver failure. After the first transplant surgery, she developed hepatic vein stenosis and severe hypersplenism requiring splenectomy. She was then initiated on hemodialysis (HD) due to the deterioration of renal function after insertion of a hepatic vein stent. She was listed as a candidate for SLK in 2011 because she required frequent plasma exchange for hepatic coma. When her Model for End-stage Liver Disease score reached 46, the new liver was donated 46 days after registration. The reduced trisegment liver and the kidney grafts were simultaneously transplanted under veno-venous bypass and intraoperative HD. The hepatic artery was reconstructed prior to portal reconstruction in order to shorten anhepatic time. Although she developed subcapsular bleeding caused by hepatic contusion on the next day, subsequent hemostasis was obtained by transcatheter embolization. Thereafter, her recovery was uneventful, except for mild rejection and renal tubular acidosis of the kidney graft. This case highlights the need to establish Japanese criteria for SLK.

AB  - As a major cause of renal failure, transient renal ischemia and reperfusion induce both acute kidney injury and late fibrosis, which are the common pathological manifestations of end-stage renal disease. Curcumin is a biologically active polyphenolic compound found in turmeric. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that curcumin has a protective action against renal fibrosis, whereas mechanisms underlying the anti-fibrosis role of curcumin remain poorly defined. Here, we found that APPL1, an important intracellular binding partner for AdipoR, was involved in the pathogenesis of acute injury or fibrosis and was significantly upregulated by curcumin in a mouse model of ischemia reperfusion-induced late kidney fibrosis. Moreover, Akt signaling was the specific signaling pathway identified downstream of APPL1 in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. Our in vitro experiment demonstrated that curcumin alleviates ischemia reperfusion-induced late kidney fibrosis via the APPL1/Akt pathway. These data are helpful for understanding the anti-fibrosis mechanism of curcumin in the pathogenesis of AKI-induced late fibrosis.

AB  - Abstract Hereditary keratin disorders of the skin and its appendages comprise a large group of clinically heterogeneous disfiguring blistering and ichthyotic diseases, primarily characterized by the loss of tissue integrity, blistering and hyperkeratosis in severely affected tissues. Pathogenic mutations in keratins cause these afflictions. Typically, these mutations in concert with characteristic features have formed the basis for improved disease diagnosis, prognosis and most recently therapy development. Examples include epidermolysis bullosa simplex, keratinopathic ichthyosis, pachyonychia congenita and several other tissue-specific hereditary keratinopathies. Understanding the molecular and genetic events underlying skin dysfunction has initiated alternative treatment approaches that may provide novel therapeutic opportunities for affected patients. Animal and in vitro disease modelling studies have shed more light on molecular pathogenesis, further defining the role of keratins in disease processes and promoting the translational development of new gene and pharmacological therapeutic strategies. Given that the molecular basis for these monogenic disorders is well established, gene therapy and drug discovery targeting pharmacological compounds with the ability to reinforce the compromised cytoskeleton may lead to promising new therapeutic strategies for treating hereditary keratinopathies. In this review, we will summarize and discuss recent advances in the preclinical and clinical modelling and development of gene, natural product, pharmacological and protein-based therapies for these disorders, highlighting the feasibility of new approaches for translational clinical therapy.

AB  - Patient X: A 67-year-old Caucasian man slips on a patch of ice. He has abrasions to his hands and has sustained significant damage to his hip. At the emergency room, he informs clinicians he takes atorvastatin, metformin, and glimepiride to treat hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). X-rays reveal a fractured hip, which will require total hip replacement surgery.

AB  - Background: Dietary supplementation of L-arginine as a mechanism to enhance cellular immune response (T lymphocytes), has slowly gained approval, and appears especially important during critical illness. Despite its clinical use, little is known as to the direct effects of L-arginine on the different T lymphocyte subpopulations. Methods: Lymphocytes were harvested from spleens of C57 Bl/6 mice, and proliferation was induced with anti-CD3 in the presence of different concentrations of L-arginine ranging from 0 to 1000 ?mol/L. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the effect of L-arginine on T lymphocyte subpopulations. Interleukin-2 production was measured by ELISA and gene expression by RT-PCR. Results: L-Arginine at or greater than 100 ?mol/L significantly enhanced anti-CD3 stimulated T lymphocyte proliferation (p =.01). L-Arginine was essential for adequate T lymphocyte (CD3+) cellular maturation (p =.01). Proliferation of Helper T cells (CD4+) was not dependent on L-arginine. In contrast, Cytotoxic T cells (CD8+) showed a dose dependent proliferation in response to L-arginine (p =.01). Of the CD8+ cells, an increase in the CD45RA negative CD8 positive (memory) T cell subpopulation was observed with the addition of L-arginine. In addition, the number of cell surface CD8 receptors (CD8R) and CD3 receptors (CD3R) increased in the presence of L-arginine (p =.01, p =.04). Interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) expression was not up-regulated by L-arginine. L-Arginine modestly increased IL-2 production and had pronounced effects on its disappearance from the culture media (p <.0001). Interleukin-2 mRNA expression was not dependent on L-arginine. Conclusions: The requirements for L-arginine for the proliferation of CD3 stimulated T lymphocytes vary widely, and have to be taken into account when studying the mechanism of how L-arginine enhances cellular proliferation. L-Arginine may increase cellular proliferation by increasing specific receptor expression and the utilization of interleukin-2. (Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 25:23?29, 2001)
