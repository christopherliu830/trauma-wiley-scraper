AB  - It has been defined that strong and multispecific cellular immune responses correlate with a better prognosis during the course of chronic diseases. A cross-enhancing effect on the resulting immune response obtained by the coadministration of recombinant hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface and core Ag was recently observed. With the objective of studying the effect of such Ag on the immune response to coinoculated heterologous Ag and vice versa, several formulations containing the recombinant HBV Ag and a multiepitopic protein (CR3) composed by CTL and Th epitopes from HIV-1 were evaluated by s.c. and mucosal administration. Combinations of two and three Ag were evaluated for cellular and humoral immune responses. The results showed that the best Ag combination for nasal immunization was the mixture comprising the CR3 recombinant HIV protein and both HBV Ag. Similarly, it was also the best formulation for s.c. immunization in aluminium phosphate adjuvant. In conclusion, it is possible to induce a Th1 stimulation of the cellular immune response specific for a HIV-based recombinant protein by formulating this Ag with the recombinant HBV Ag.

AB  - Summary Nursing cats and dogs will benefit from ongoing analgesia post-cesarean, or to manage post-surgical or traumatic pain or inflammatory illness. It is hoped that future studies investigating the commonly prescribed analgesics, including the secretion of analgesics in milk of lactating dogs and cats, will be undertaken to offer guidance in managing this group of animals. An alternative, or as post-operative analgesia a fentanyl, continuous rate infusion (CRI), with careful titration to a minimal effective dose, is suggested for cats and dogs. A clinical interpretation of analgesia may be due to behavioural changes and sedation produced by serotonin re-uptake inhibition. Anesthesia and analgesia protocols should be designed based on the health status of the dam/queen, the procedural need and the expected pain level. Alpha2 agonists are commonly administered to cows and mares without apparent effect on the neonatal calf or foal, but the effects may be different in puppies and kittens.

AB  - Background Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are regulators of endothelial permeability. Objective Plasma concentrations of Ang-2 and VEGF are increased in dogs with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis and are correlated with disease severity and outcome. Animals Healthy dogs (n?=?18) and client-owned dogs with SIRS (n?=?34) or sepsis (n?=?25). Methods Prospective observational study. Ang-2 and VEGF concentrations in admission plasma samples were compared between healthy dogs and dogs with SIRS or sepsis, and between survivors and non-survivors. Correlations with the acute patient physiologic and laboratory evaluation (APPLEfast) disease severity score were examined. Results Median Ang-2 was significantly higher in dogs with SIRS (19.3; interquartile range [IQR]: 8.6-25.7?ng/mL) and sepsis (21.2; IQR: 10.3-30.1?ng/mL) compared to healthy dogs (7.6; IQR: 6.7-9.8?ng/mL). Ang-2 was significantly higher in non-survivors (24.1; IQR: 11.9-50.0?ng/mL) than survivors (10.2; IQR: 7.2-21.5?ng/mL) but did not correlate with the APPLEfast score. Admission Ang-2 predicted negative outcome in dogs with SIRS and sepsis with reasonable accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.75, confidence interval [CI]: 0.59-0.85; sensitivity: 0.5, CI: 0.29-0.71; specificity: 0.87, CI: 0.75-0.95); differentiation between sepsis and SIRS was poor (AUC: 0.58). Plasma VEGF was significantly higher in dogs with sepsis (45; IQR: 14-107.5?pg/mL) than in dogs with SIRS (3.3; IQR: 0-35.6?pg/mL) or healthy dogs (0; IQR: 0?pg/mL; P =?0.008). VEGF was significantly (P =?.0004) higher in non-survivors (34.5; IQR: 0-105.7?pg/mL) than in survivors (0; IQR: 0-55.2?pg/mL). The ability of VEGF to predict a negative outcome was poor. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Ang-2 may represent a useful additional prognostic marker in dogs with SIRS.

AB  - Abstract The amniotic fluid has been identified as an untapped source of cells with broad potential, which possess immunomodulatory properties and do not have the ethical and legal limitations of embryonic stem cells. CD117(c-Kit)+ cells selected from amniotic fluid have been shown to differentiate into cell lineages representing all three embryonic germ layers without generating tumors, making them ideal candidates for regenerative medicine applications. Moreover, their ability to engraft in injured organs and modulate immune and repair responses of host tissues, suggest that transplantation of such cells may be useful for the treatment of various degenerative and inflammatory diseases. Although significant questions remain regarding the origin, heterogeneous phenotype, and expansion potential of amniotic fluid stem cells, evidence to date supports their potential role as a valuable stem cell source for the field of regenerative medicine.

AB  - Abstract Organ availability and acceptability limit pediatric HTx. What characteristics define an unacceptable or high-risk pediatric donor remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to characterize a large cohort of pediatric donors and determine the donor risk factors, including cumulative risk, that affect recipient survival. Data from the PHTS, a prospective multicenter study, were used to examine the impact of donor factors on the outcomes of patients listed <18 yr of age who received a HTx between 1993 and 2009. Donor data were available for 3149 of 3156 HTx (99.8%). Donor cause of death, need for inotropes, or CPR did not affect survival outcomes (p = 0.05). Ischemic time also did not have an impact on overall recipient survival; however, longer ischemic times negatively impacted one-yr post-transplant survival (p < 0.0001). There was no impact of cumulative risk factors on survival (p = 0.8). Although used in a minority of cases, hormonal therapy in the donor positively impacted survival (p = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, the only donor factor associated with decreased survival was smaller donor BSA, the other factors being related to the recipient characteristics. When analyzed by recipient age, there were no donor-related factors that affected survival for those who received a transplant at <6 months of age. Longer ischemic time (p < 0.0001) and greater age difference between the recipient and donor (p = 0.0098) were donor-related factors impacting early-phase survival for recipients who received a graft at ≥10 yr of age. Factors perceived to define a marginal or high-risk pediatric heart donor including inotrope use, CPR and donor cause of death may have less impact on outcomes than previously thought. Longer ischemic times did impact one yr, but not overall survival, and this impact was much greater with older donors. Parameters for accepting a donor heart can potentially be expanded, especially in the infant age group, but strong consideration should always be given to the interaction between ischemic time and donor age.

AB  - The purpose of the present paper was to evaluate an ultrasound contrast agent (Levovist) in patients with oliguric acute renal failure (ARF) in order to assess renal vascularity, differentiate acute tubular from cortical necrosis and predict prognosis. Ten intensive care unit (ICU) patients with oliguric ARF were prospectively investigated by ultrasound including colour, power and pulsed Doppler before and after injection of Levovist. Doppler signals were graded as absent, equivocal or present from the inner and outer portions of the renal parenchyma, and these findings were correlated with clinical parameters and outcome. Only one patient had findings in keeping with acute cortical necrosis. All patients who survived had parenchymal vascularity while only three of six (50%) who died had parenchymal vascularity after Levovist. The ultrasound contrast caused no side effects and additional information was provided which improved diagnostic confidence, enabled appropriate classification of patients as having tubular or cortical necrosis and therefore added prognostic information.

AB  - To evaluate the efficacy of supplemental arginine with nutritional support in the presence of sepsis, eighty-eight gastrostomized female Hartley guinea pigs were implanted with osmotic pumps effusing an Eschericia coli/Staphylococcus aureus mixture. Animals were randomized and infused for two weeks with isocaloric and isovolumetric diets containing 0%, 2%, 4%, or 6% supplemental arginine as arginine hydrochloride. Survival was 12/22 (54%) in 0%, 9/22 (41%) in 2% and 4%, and 2/22 (9%) in 6%. Analysis by chi-square test of independence was significant (p = 0.0141) with 6% survival lower than the others. Median survival was 11 days in 0%, 8 days in 2% and 6%, and 9 days in 4%. Median survival was longer in 0% than in 2% or 6% (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA: p = 0.02). Nitrogen balance was significantly lower in 6% compared to 0% on days 2 through 10, and lower than 2% and 4% on days 6 and 9. Nitrogen balance was higher in 0% than in 2% on days 4, 6, 10, and 13. Serum albumin and C3 were lower in all experimental groups than normal controls (ANOVA: p = 0.01). Comparison of liver, spleen, adrenals, gastrocnemius, and carcass weights, cell-mediated immunity as determined by contact sensitivity to DNFB, and transferrin showed no significant differences. There was a positive dose-response effect seen amongst the experimental groups for the amino acids arginine, ornithine, and citrulline in relation to the amount of supplemental arginine. This study suggests that dietary arginine supplementation does not enhance survival in a guinea pig model of established peritonitis. (Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 14:237?244, 1990)

AB  - Pancreatitis is the most common disorder of the exocrine pancreas in both dogs and cats. Ante-mortem diagnosis of canine and feline pancreatitis can be challenging. The clinical picture of dogs and cats with pancreatitis varies greatly (from very mild to severe or even fatal) and is characterised by non-specific findings. Complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile and urinalysis should always be performed in dogs and cats suspected of having pancreatitis, although findings are not-specific for pancreatitis. Serum amylase and lipase activities and trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) concentrations have no or only limited clinical value for the diagnosis of pancreatitis in either dogs or cats. Conversely, serum pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (PLI) concentration is currently considered to be the clinicopathological test of choice for the diagnosis of canine and feline pancreatitis. Abdominal radiography is a useful diagnostic tool for the exclusion of other diseases that may cause similar clinical signs to those of pancreatitis. Abdominal ultrasonography can be very useful for the diagnosis of pancreatitis, but this depends largely on the clinician's experience. Histopathological examination of the pancreas is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis and classification of pancreatitis, but it is not without limitations. In clinical practice, a combination of careful evaluation of the animal's history, serum PLI concentration and abdominal ultrasonography, together with pancreatic cytology or histopathology when indicated or possible, is considered to be the most practical and reliable means for an accurate diagnosis or exclusion of pancreatitis compared with other diagnostic modalities.

AB  - Summary This chapter deals with the various disorders of consciousness, sleep, and conditions requiring neurointensive care support. The role of an intensive care unit is to maintain normal physiological homeostasis while actively treating the underlying cause of any physiological derangement. Neurological complications on the ICU are usually caused by metabolic encephalopathy, seizures, hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, stroke or neuromuscular disorders but multiple complications are common. Sleep medicine is an evolving field with wide variability in knowledge of each individual sleep disorder. The chapter lists the most recent classification that is based on common complaints (insomnia or hypersomnias) as well as presumed aetiological basis (circadian rhythm disorders) or organ system from which problems arise (sleep-related breathing disorders). It also explains the issues involved in determining brain death. The diagnosis of brain death is necessary when withdrawal of artificial life support is considered and if the possibility of organ donation exists.
