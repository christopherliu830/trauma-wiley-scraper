AB  - Backgyound: Specific morbidity related to underfeeding and overfeeding necessitates the design of nutrition support regimens that provide calories equal to those required on the basis of energy expenditure. This prospective multicenter trial was designed to determine what percent of patients in long-term acute care facilities receive feeding appropriate to their needs and whether accuracy of feeding has an impact on patient clinical status. Methods: Patients on mechanical ventilation who were hospitalized at 32 Vencor Hospitals over a 9-week period and who were receiving only enteral nutrition by continuous infusion at a presumed goal rate were evaluated once by indirect calorimetry (IC) while on feeding. Caloric intake over the preceding 24 hours was determined by physician orders and by patient intake/output (I/O) record. Caloric requirements were defined by measured resting energy expenditure (REE) + 10% for activity. Degree of metabolism was defined by the ratio: (measured REE/Harris?Benedict predicted REE) X 100, and the degree of feeding by the ratio: (calories provided/calories required) X 100. Results: IC was performed on 335 patients (mean, 11.2 patients per center; range, 1 to 32), of which 72 were excluded for nonphysiological results or failure to achieve steady state, 21 for receiving parenteral nutrition, and 29 for not being on mechanical ventilation at time of testing. The 213 study patients were 58.7% male with mean age 70.1 years (range, 20 to 90 years). Measured REE was <25 kcal/kg in 66.2% of patients and 25 to 35 kcal/kg in 28.6%. Barely half (48.4%) of this patient population was hypermetabolic. Based on physician orders, the majority of patients (58.2%) were overfed, receiving> 110% of required calories, and 12.2% were underfed, receiving <90% of requirements. Discrepancies based on I/O records, however, suggested that 36.1% of patients received <90% of those calories ordered. By either basis, only about 25% of patients received feeding within 10% of required calories. The percent of patients being overfed varied between centers, ranging from 32.2% to 92.8%, and was not affected by years of facility IC experience or volume of IC studies per month. The pattern of caloric provision as measured by degree of feeding correlated inversely to degree of metabolism (p <.0001, R 2 =.24). Accuracy of feeding had an impact on ventilatory status, as degree of feeding correlated inversely with minute ventilation (p=.001, R 2 =.05). Degree of overfeeding also led to significant increases in azotemia (p =.033, R 2 =.02). Extrapolating study data over 1 year, reduction in excess volume of enteral formula would have resulted in a cost savings of up to $1.3 million for the Vencor system. Conclusions: Because energy expenditure is difficult to predict on the basis of conventional equations, patients in long-term acute care facilities routinely are overfed and underfed, with only 25% receiving calories within 10% of required needs. Measuring a patient's energy requirement at least once by IC is important, because the degree of metabolism predicts how easily a patient will be underfed or overfed. The amount of infused calories should be compared with caloric requirements measured by IC, because the accuracy or degree of underfeeding or overfeeding has an impact on ventilatory status and the likelihood for developing azotemia. Although physician practice or bias may reduce the optimal clinical effect, the use of IC to determine caloric requirements may result in significant cost savings.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Primary graft failure (PGF) is an important contributor to early mortality, accounting for 41% of deaths within the first 30 days after heart transplantation (HT). Donor hypernatremia has been associated with PGF development. However, controversial data exist regarding the impact of sodium deregulation in patient survival after HT. This study aimed to assess the influence of donor hypernatremia on PGF development and to determine the serum sodium level threshold to assist in decision-making for organ procurement. Methods The medical record from 200 HT patients and organ donors were retrospectively assessed and categorized by PGF occurrence. Donor sodium levels were compared and cut-off points obtained by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A multiple logistic regression model was applied to assess the effects of factors and covariates that influence PGF development. Results Sodium levels of donors were significantly higher in recipients who developed PGF than those who did not develop PGF (162 vs. 153 mmol/L, P = .001). The sodium cut-off value determined by the ROC curve was 159 mmol/L. The group who received organs from donors with a serum sodium concentration ≥159 mmol/L had a higher incidence of PGF (63.3% vs 32.4%, P < .001). Furthermore, donor sodium levels ≥159 mmol/L increased the likelihood of recipients developing PGF by 3.4 times. It is also observed that the incidence of donor smoking addiction was significantly higher in the PGF group (28.6% vs. 11.5%, P = .004) and donor smoking addiction increased the risk of developing PGF by 2.8 times. Conclusion Smoking addiction and the application of suboptimal organs from donors with hypernatremia contribute to primary graft failure in heart transplantation.

AB  - Summary Body fluids (blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid) are preferred samples for neurological testing. This chapter focuses on the clinical laboratory examinations used to screen, diagnose, predict, and monitor neurologic disorders in geriatric patients. As the goals of laboratory testing in this population overlap those of general laboratory testing, a brief section on test interpretation and general laboratory considerations precedes the sections devoted to neurologic disorders of geriatric patients. The neurologic disorders for which laboratory investigations are described in the chapter are: dementias (Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body disease), movement disorders (Parkinson's disease and Parkinson-plus syndromes), cerebrovascular disorders (infarction and hemorrhage), and other disorders such as headache and depression.

AB  - Summary Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) has relevant consequences on the quality of life of patients and their caregivers, and is one of the principal causes of hospitalization in cirrhosis. Also, HE is a marker of poor prognosis. Its diagnosis requires an accurate and work-up to consider confounders, factors of vulnerability, and precipitation. The detection and monitoring of the covert expression of HE, which require psychometric or neurophysiologic investigation having their own specific characteristics and value, is considered in detail. Understanding the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying this condition, treatment options are highlighted in their meaning, so that clinical practice is greatly helped by this comprehensive update.

AB  - Key Clinical Message The stalling or regression of pubertal development may be the first sign of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism in adolescent males. We report here a case of pediatric hypergonadotropic hypogonadism that likely developed secondary to ischemic injury during severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This case highlights the importance of performing genital exams during all evaluations of pediatric patients.

AB  - Clinical and experimental evidence confirms that delivery of nutrients via the gastrointestinal tract reduces septic morbidity in critically injured patients. Early enteral feeding seems to maintain mucosal integrity and to support the gut as an important immunologic organ that may affect other areas of the body. There is increasing evidence to suggest that specific nutrients are especially beneficial in maintaining intestinal host-defense function in times of critical illness and injury.
