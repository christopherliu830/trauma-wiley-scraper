AB  - Summary Toxic, nutritional and metabolic derangements can cause damage to the nervous system by a variety of mechanisms and lead to a wide spectrum of characteristic neurological disorders. This chapter includes a review of the effects of accidental and deliberate exposure to industrial and environmental toxins and drugs of addiction including alcohol. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) occurs in the liver and ovaries of puffer fish, toad fish and some types of crabs. Exposure to radiation occurs naturally but this is low intensity and carries few risks. Direct high pressure injury to the CNS leads to a progressive rest or intention tremor, myoclonus, hyper-reflexia and transient cognitive and memory disturbance. Alcohol abuse is extremely common and is associated with important cultural, economic and environmental influences and consequences. The chapter presents neurological disease seen in adult patients with inherited disorders of metabolism. It discusses the clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, investigation and management of adult onset leukodystrophy.

AB  - Abstract The transition between soluble intrinsically disordered tau protein and aggregated tau in neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease is unknown. Here, we propose that soluble tau species can undergo liquid?liquid phase separation (LLPS) under cellular conditions and that phase-separated tau droplets can serve as an intermediate toward tau aggregate formation. We demonstrate that phosphorylated or mutant aggregation prone recombinant tau undergoes LLPS, as does high molecular weight soluble phospho-tau isolated from human Alzheimer brain. Droplet-like tau can also be observed in neurons and other cells. We found that tau droplets become gel-like in minutes, and over days start to spontaneously form thioflavin-S-positive tau aggregates that are competent of seeding cellular tau aggregation. Since analogous LLPS observations have been made for FUS, hnRNPA1, and TDP43, which aggregate in the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, we suggest that LLPS represents a biophysical process with a role in multiple different neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Abstract We report the case of a 16-year-old male with multifocal osteosarcoma presented with symptomatic hypocalcemia. The patient presented signs of hypocalcemia accompanied by generalized bone pain and a femoral mass. Further evaluation revealed secondary hyperparathyroidism, highly elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, and generalized sclerotic and lytic lesions. Biopsy confirmed osteosarcomatosis. Despite aggressive chemotherapy, he died from progressive disease 2 months after diagnosis. The course of disease in this patient suggests that hypocalcemia reflects a poor prognosis.

AB  - Summary Neuromuscular diseases have traditionally been overlooked, underdiagnosed and poorly treated when compared with neurological diseases with greater visibility, social impact, or which pose a threat for survival. This chapter provides a comprehensive summary of disorders of peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction, muscle and the anterior horn cell. Peripheral nerves are bundles of axons, Schwann cells, elaborated myelin and the supporting cellular tissues whose primary purpose is to communicate neural information between the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral sensory or effector structures. All peripheral nervous system (PNS) axons are ensheathed by Schwann cells and the Schwann cells are, in turn, invested by a continuous layer of basal lamina. Functional or structural abnormalities of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) interfere with the transmission of neural impulses from motor nerves to muscles. Myasthenic crisis indicates the development of ventilatory failure. The chapter also talks about congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), ermatomyositis, polymyositis, necrotising autoimmune myopathy (NAM) and rhabdomyolysis.

AB  - Abstract Purpose to evaluate the current rate of pulmonary embolism (PE) in our medico-surgical intensive care unit (ICU), to identify risk factors, and to determine the outcome of PE in ICU. Methods We performed a prospective cohort study of consecutive patients requiring intensive care admission during a one-year period. We included, in this prospective study, all the patients with confirmed PE admitted in ICU with more than 18 years of age, and expected to stay in ICU for more than 48 hours. Only the patients who had a clinical suspicion (unexplained hypoxemia and/or shock) for PE underwent diagnostic studies. Results During the study period, 842 patients were admitted in our ICU. One hundred and two patients were excluded. The diagnosis of PE was confirmed in 75 patients (10.1%). In our study, all patients (100%) had received some forms of pharmaceutical prophylaxis (PP) during ICU stay. The median time from ICU admission to diagnosis of PE was 6 days. The diagnosis of PE was made by spiral CT in 74 patients (98.7%), and by echocardiography in 1 case (1.3%). The mean ICU stay was 26.3 ± 26.5 days (median: 20 days). During their ICU stay, 73 patients (97.3%) developed one, or more, organ failure. Respiratory failure was the most observed (97.3%). Moreover, 38 patients (50.6%) developed nosocomial infections and 29 (38.6%) died. The multivariate analysis showed that the risk factors associated with mortality were the presence of shock the day of PE diagnosis and the presence of right ventricular dilatation on echocardiography. Conclusion Our findings confirm that subjects in the ICU are at high risk of PE, due to a high number of risk-factors. PE was associated with higher ICU mortality and a significantly higher ICU LOS. Our results invite to revise the preventive strategies of deep venous thrombosis and PE in patients requiring ICU admission.

AB  - Summary Water homeostasis is critical to all mammals and maintenance of the tonicity of extracellular fluids is crucial for cell function. The maintenance of water balance in healthy humans is achieved by thirst, vasopressin and kidney function. Renin?angiotensin?aldosterone and natriuretic peptides also regulate water and electrolyte balance. In diabetes insipidus, large volumes of dilute urine (polyuria) are excreted due to vasopressin deficiency (Central Diabetes Insipidus (CDI)), vasopressin resistance (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) or excessive water intake (primary polydipsia). Polyuria must be evaluated by means of a water deprivation test, with measurement of plasma and urine osmolality, and a desmopressin challenge should be performed if diabetes insipidus has been diagnosed. Patients with CDI and adipsia have a significantly higher risk of morbidity and mortality than in non-adipsic diabetes insipidus. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is secondary to arginine vasopressin receptor-2 mutations, abnormalities of aquaporin 2 water channel or other intrinsic kidney disorders.

AB  - Summary This study reports the incidence and associated mortality of acquired hypernatraemia (Na?> 150?mmol.l?1) in a general medical/surgical intensive care unit. Patients admitted over a 5-year period with normal sodium values were eligible for inclusion; exclusions were made for burn/neurosurgical diagnoses and for hypertonic saline therapy. From 3475 admissions (3317 patients), 266 (7.7%) episodes of hypernatraemia were observed. Hospital mortality was 33.5% in the hypernatraemic group and 7.7% in the normonatraemic group (p?<?0.001). Acquired hypernatraemia was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.37?2.82, p?<?0.001). Intermediate sodium levels (145?150?mmol.l?1) were associated with increased mortality (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.02?1.98). Uncorrected sodium at discharge (p?=?0.001) and peak sodium (p?=?0.001) were better predictors of mortality than time to onset (p?=?0.71) and duration of hypernatraemia (p?=?1.0). Hypernatraemia avoidance is justified, but determinants of hypernatraemia and benefits of targeted treatment strategies require further elucidation.
