AB  - The case of a 78 year old man who presented with fever and hepatic abscesses is reported. He was found to have an infected abdominal aortic aneurysm and the organism cultured was Streptococcus milleri. He was treated with an in situ Dacron graft and high-dose intravenous penicillin. This may be suitable treatment when Gram-positive organisms are involved and there is no gross peritoneal soiling.

AB  - The search to improve outcomes in critically ill patients through nutrition support has steadily progressed over the past 4 decades. One current approach to this problem is the addition of specific nutrients as primary therapy to improve host defenses and improve the outcome of critically ill patients. The field is referred to as ?pharmaconutrition,? with the hope of focusing investigations on each nutrient to understand its pharmacological effects on immune and clinical outcomes. The purpose of this review is to describe some of the known physiological mechanisms of pharmaconutrients such as glutamine, arginine, ?-3 fatty acids, and selenium.

AB  - Summary Patients referred to a nephrologist are subjected to a bewildering array of diagnostic tests and procedures. This chapter explains the procedures commonly undertaken in the diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease. It covers the tests including those involving blood and urine, radiological tests, invasive investigations, and methods of evaluating glomerular filtration rate. The chapter discusses investigations that are carried out prior to initiating anaemia treatments, such as erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs), as well as those used in cases of diminished response to ESAs. It evaluates the nurse's role in post-procedure care. The World Health Organization published guidelines on best phlebotomy practices, recommending standards for quality care that include laboratory sampling and the maintenance of quality control. Nurses must complete the necessary training before carrying out a new role, such as venepuncture.

AB  - Since Haissaguerre and his colleagues demonstrated the importance of the pulmonary veins in the generation of atrial fibrillation (AF) in 1998, a variety of different ablative interventions have been performed to eliminate AF. Various complications related to catheterization, ablation itself including pulmonary vein stenosis, pericardial effusion, stroke, and atrioesophageal fistula have been reported. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a systemic syndrome characterized by enhanced activation of coagulation with some intravascular fibrin formation and deposition. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of a patient whose condition was complicated by DIC after segmental ostial isolation of pulmonary veins for persistent AF. The patient has completely recovered from the DIC by hemodialysis, administration of blood constituents for 15 days.

AB  - Abstract In this editor's review, articles published in 2012 are organized by category and briefly summarized. We aim to provide a brief reflection of the currently available worldwide knowledge that is intended to advance and better human life while providing insight for continued application of technologies and methods of organ replacement, recovery, and regeneration. As the official journal of the International Federation for Artificial Organs, the International Faculty for Artificial Organs, and the International Society for Rotary Blood Pumps, Artificial Organs continues in the original mission of its founders ?to foster communications in the field of artificial organs on an international level.? Artificial Organs continues to publish developments and clinical applications of artificial organ technologies in this broad and expanding field of organ replacement, recovery, and regeneration from all over the world. We take this time also to express our gratitude to our authors for offering their work to this journal. We offer our very special thanks to our reviewers who give so generously of time and expertise to review, critique, and especially provide such meaningful suggestions to the author's work whether eventually accepted or rejected, and especially to those whose native tongue is not English. Without these excellent and dedicated reviewers, the quality expected from such a journal could not be possible. We also express our special thanks to our publisher, Wiley Periodicals, for their expert attention and support in the production and marketing of Artificial Organs. We look forward to recording further advances in the coming years.

AB  - SUMMARY: Culture-negative peritoneal inflammation accounts for between 5 and 20% of cases of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients. Diagnostic yields may be enhanced considerably by reculturing dialysate effluents using appropriate collection methods and optimal laboratory techniques (including prolonged low-temperature and anaerobic incubations). In patients with persistent culture-negative peritonitis, consideration should be given to the possibilities of unusual or fastidious microorganisms (especially fungi and mycobacteria) and non-infective causes (especially drug reactions, malignancy, visceral inflammation and retroperitoneal inflammation). In this paper, an illustrative case of persistent culture-negative peritonitis is presented followed by a discussion of the investigative approach to such patients, with particular emphasis on differential diagnosis and the limitations of currently available tests.

AB  - Summary Debridement is an essential component of wound care as the presence of devitalised tissue can impede the healing process. Larval therapy has been used for the debridement of wounds for several hundred years. A plethora of literature is available on larval therapy, but many authors acknowledge the paucity of large-scale clinical trials supporting its effectiveness. While the exact mechanism of larval therapy remains unknown, it encompasses three processes: debridement, disinfection and promotion of healing. This literature review discusses the applications, benefits and disadvantages of larval therapy as well as the processes involved. The literature reviewed suggests that further comprehensive research into the mechanisms involved in larval therapy is required to ensure that it may be used to best medical advantage.
