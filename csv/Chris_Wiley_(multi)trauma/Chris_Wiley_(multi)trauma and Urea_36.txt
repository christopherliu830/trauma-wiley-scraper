AB  - Abdominal wall hernia is a recurrent issue world-wide and requires the implantation of over 1 million meshes per year. Because permanent meshes such as polypropylene and polyester are not free of complications after implantation, many mesh modifications and new functionalities have been investigated over the last decade. Indeed, mesh optimization is the focus of intense development and the biomaterials utilized are now envisioned as being bioactive substrates that trigger various physiological processes in order to prevent complications and to promote tissue integration. In this context, it is of paramount interest to review the most relevant bio-functionalities being brought to new meshes and to open new avenues for the innovative development of the next generation of meshes with enhanced properties for functional abdominal wall hernia repair.

AB  - Abstract Background Numerous oncology patients who receive targeted therapy suffer from the skin adverse effects induced. Novel agents, that is tyrosine kinase inhibitors and RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, have given good results in patient survival while decreasing the systemic toxicities in comparison to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, but are also related to skin adverse effects. Aims In this article, we highlighted the importance of specific pharmaceutical and dermocosmetic management of the untoward events of targeted therapy. Conclusion The combination of Oncodermatology, Psychodermatology, Cosmetic Dermatology, Cosmetic Science, Dermatopharmacology and Aesthetic Science can offer a lot for the prevention or early relief of the cutaneous adverse effects in oncology patients receiving targeted therapy.

AB  - SUMMARY Patients receiving renal replacement therapy especially haemodialysis (HD) are at high risk of foot ulcers which can lead to amputation. With the increasing numbers of patients with diabetes now presenting with renal failure, renal nurses are in a pivotal position to educate patients and initiate and oversee good foot care. This paper describes the risk factors for these patients and discusses general care for prevention and treatment of these factors. Factors such as regular screening which can be done easily and effectively in an HD setting where patients attend regularly is the first method towards prevention. Care and treatment of foot wounds based on results from the author's unit are discussed. The creation of a diabetes care programme for the author's HD unit have resulted in a more holistic approach to the care of the patient with diabetes and renal disease with special attention to foot care, which in turn has lead to an improved standard of care and better management of the patients? diabetes. This paper discusses information from this programme offering a summary of risks and treatments to assist those caring for these patients.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aim Vascular calcification has played a vital role in increasing the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in maintenance haemodialysis (MHD) patients. This study is aimed at exploring the prognostic value of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) estimated by plain lateral abdominal radiography in MHD patients. Methods Lateral abdominal radiography was used to determine the abdominal aortic calcification score (AACS). The serum level of fibroblast growth factor-23 was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patients were divided into two groups: no or minor calcification group (AACS <?5) and moderate to severe calcification group (AACS ≥?5). All patients were followed up to death or the end of the study (30 November 2016). Results A total of 114 patients were enrolled in this study, including 64 males (56.1%), and the mean age was 57.42?±?13.48?years. Seventy-six patients (66.7%) exhibited AAC. Independent predictors for moderate to severe calcification were older age (odds ratio (OR) 1.06 (1.02?1.10), P = 0.003), longer dialysis vintage (OR 1.01 (1.00?1.02), P = 0.039), presence of smoking (OR 3.01 (1.18?7.70), P = 0.021) and higher Log fibroblast growth factor-23 serum levels (OR 2.83 (1.01?7.94), P = 0.048). During a median follow-up of 6.0 (5.6, 6.1) years, 22 patients (19.3%) died of all-cause death, and 17 cases (14.9%) died of CVD. Kaplan?Meier survival curves showed that patients in the moderate to severe calcification group had significantly higher all-cause (28.3 vs 11.5%, P = 0.028) and CVD mortality (22.6 vs 8.2%, P = 0.035) than that in the no or minor calcification group. A multivariate Cox regression showed that AACS (hazard ratio 1.08 (1.01?1.15), P = 0.022) was an independent predictor of CVD mortality. Compared with the no or minor calcification group, the risk of CVD mortality was increased by a factor of 3.14 in patients in the moderate to severe calcification group (hazard ratio 3.14 (1.04?9.44), P = 0.042). Conclusion Our data suggest that AAC is prevalent in MHD patients and could provide potential predictive information for CVD mortality. Plain lateral abdominal radiography, which is simple and cheap and involves lower radiation, might represent an appropriate screening method for evaluating vascular calcification in daily clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract Perioperative medicine is rapidly emerging as a key discipline to address the specific needs of high-risk surgical groups, such as those on chronic dialysis. Crude hospital separation rates for chronic dialysis patients are considerably higher than patients with normal renal function, with up to 15% of admission being related to surgical intervention. Dialysis dependency carries substantial mortality and morbidity risk compared to patients with normal renal function. This group of patients has a high comorbid burden and complex medical need, making accurate perioperative planning essential. Existing perioperative risk assessment tools are unvalidated in chronic dialysis patients. Furthermore, they fail to incorporate important dialysis treatment-related characteristics that could potentially influence perioperative outcomes. There is a dearth of information on perioperative outcomes of Australasian dialysis patients. Current perioperative outcome estimates stem predominantly from North American literature; however, the generalisability of these findings is limited, as the survival of North American dialysis patients is significantly inferior to their Australasian counterparts and potentially confounds reported perioperative outcomes; let alone regional variation in surgical indication and technique. We propose that data linkage between high-quality national registries will provide more complete data with more detailed patient and procedural information to allow for more informative analyses to develop and validate dialysis-specific risk assessment tools.
