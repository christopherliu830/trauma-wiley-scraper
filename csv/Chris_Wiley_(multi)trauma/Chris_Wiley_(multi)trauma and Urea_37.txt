AB  - Abstract It is recognised that the commonest organic cause for impotence is diabetes. It must be appreciated however, that the aetiology of impotence in diabetes can be due to a variety of factors that cover the whole spectrum of impotence. The problem may be primarily neurogenic, vasculogenic or a combination of these factors. In addition, impotence in the diabetic may be contributed to or caused by diuretic or antihypertensive medication, a penile abnormality such as Peyronie's disease or be purely psychogenic. Whatever the possible organic basis for the problem, an additional psychogenic overlay is likely. It is apparent therefore that a comprehensive medical history and specific detailed psychosexual history are required, together with a relevant clinical examination and screening before a likely cause or causes can be identified and appropriate treatment instituted. This cannot readily be undertaken in a busy outpatient department and time must be made available for the impotent patient to be comprehensively counselled in a specially designated clinic.

AB  - Abstract Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) is a specific cutaneous toxicity caused by a variety of antitumor drugs. The most common drugs include capecitabine, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and fluorouracil (PLD), tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It is a dose-limiting cutaneous toxicity of these drugs. We reported an advanced lung adenocarcinoma female patient, who developed a Grade 3 HFS after a third-line treatment with apatinib of 250?mg for 10?days, the patient developed intolerable pain with pruritus. Large erythema on the skin of the hand, with local ulceratio, exudation, and desquamation of cutaneous lesions. After treatment with 100?mg of thalidomide every night for 1 week, the patient's HFS was significantly relieved, and the duration of the remission was about 2 months, which not only significantly improved the patient's quality of life, but also maintained the antitumor strength.

AB  - Summary Entrance of air into the pleural cavity results in positive intrapleural pressure that causes collapse of the lungs, with a subsequent drop in venous return and cardiac output. In dogs or cats, esophageal perforation can lead to pneumothorax, and it can also result from rupture of an emphysematous bulla, pleural bleb, neoplasm, Paragonimus cyst, or abscessed lung lobe. Thoracocentesis should be performed when pneumothorax is suspected and it might be required as a life-saving procedure prior to radiographic or ultrasonographic confirmation of air accumulation. In more severely affected animals, tachypnea and respiratory distress can occur, or collapse can result from pneumomediastinum accompanied by pneumothorax. Mediastinitis or a mediastinal mass effect can result from fungal infection causing enlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes, or by bacteria directly inoculated through the thoracic wall or entering via an esophageal or tracheal route. Chylothorax is caused by leakage of lymphatic fluid from the thoracic duct into the pleural cavity.

AB  - Summary This chapter discusses the following skin and soft-tissue infections: impetigo, furuncles, cellulitis, erysipelas, necrotizing fasciitis, diabetic foot infections and animal bites. In cases of a non-resolving impetigo, infection may be with community-acquired methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and doxycycline, clindamycin, or TMP/SMX should be considered. Furuncles, or ?boils?, are infections of hair follicles usually caused by S. aureus. Cellulitis usually presents with pain, erythema with typically indistinct borders, and swelling. Erysipelas is a distinctive form of cellulitis. The literature on necrotizing fasciitis is predominately empiric, based on retrospective reviews and small case series. Diabetic foot infections should be classified using a valid classification system based on the extent of local infection, involvement of deeper tissues and systemic inflammatory response. Animal bites are very common, but the vast majority of people never seek medical attention.

AB  - Abstract Organ donor contraindications are frequently reassessed for impact on recipient outcomes in attempt to meet demand for transplantation. This study retrospectively analyzed the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry for adult heart transplants from 1987 to September 2016 to characterize the impact of donor malignancy history in heart transplantation. Kaplan-Meier estimates illustrated 10-year survival. Propensity score matching was utilized for 1:1 matching of donors with and without history of malignancy, and Cox proportional hazards and logistic regressions were used to analyze the matched population. Of 38 781 heart transplants, 622 (1.6%) had a donor history of malignancy. Cox regressions demonstrated that donor malignancy predicted increased 10-year mortality (HR = 1.16 [1.01-1.33]), but this difference did not persist when conditioned upon 1 year post-transplant survival (log-rank = 0.643). Cox regressions of the propensity score-matched population (455 pairs) found no association between donor malignancy and 10-year mortality (HR = 1.02 [0.84-1.24]). Older age and higher rates of hypertension were observed in donors with a history of malignancy whose recipients died within the first year post-transplant. Therefore, increased recipient mortality is likely due to donor characteristics beyond malignancy, creating the potential for expanded donor selection.

AB  - Abstract Taste is an essential component of flavour. Although taste carries fewer distinctive qualities than odour, it provides an essential base on which aroma builds to generate the widely varying flavour of our foods and beverages. The present review covers a wide range of perceptual/psychophysical topics on taste. The first section reviews the taste research questions of early last century; the second section addresses the psychophysical taste research topics of the last few decades; and in the third section, the question is raised whether the old research topics of 80?100 years ago, which have largely not been answered, are worth reconsidering and pursuing.
