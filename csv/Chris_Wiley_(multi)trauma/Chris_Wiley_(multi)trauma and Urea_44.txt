AB  - Summary 1 The results have been described of an experimental investigation undertaken to determine the relative merits of a number of different suture materials for the repair of severed nerves. 2 Fine plain catgut, white silk and human hair are the most suitable materials for repairing nerves. Of these three silk has a slight advantage over plain catgut when technical factors as well as those associated with the reaction induced by the suture material are taken into consideration. 3 The outcome following nerve suture does not depend solely on the type of suture material employed but to a large degree on the manner in which it is used to unite the nerve ends. The principles which should govern the method of application of sutures in peripheral nerve surgery have been detailed.

AB  - Summary The International League against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification of seizure type is the most widely accepted classification scheme for epilepsy. This chapter focuses on ILAE classification of the epilepsies and epilepsy syndromes. Broadly speaking, genetic, congenital and perinatal conditions are the most common causes of early childhood onset epilepsy, whereas in adult life, epilepsy is more likely to be result from external nongenetic causes, but this distinction is by no means absolute. Epileptic seizures feature in the differential diagnosis of many transient neurological symptoms. There are differences in the common presentations and differential diagnoses in adults, infants and children and people largely confine this description to adult patients. Epilepsy surgery is carried out with three objectives: to stop seizures, to ameliorate the seizures or to remove a progressive lesion or one that carries other risks such as haemorrhage. The chapter concentrates on the assessment, surgery and outcome of those who have surgery primarily for their epilepsy.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Physiological stress is one of the various factors that can have an impact on stable isotope ratios. However, its effect on bone collagen stable isotope ratios is still not fully understood. This study aims to build on previous research on how different disease stages may affect bone collagen stable isotope ratios. Materials and Methods Carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotope ratios were assessed in 33 skeletons that retained evidence of infectious disease and healed fractures. Samples were taken from active lesions (long bones n =?14; ribs n =?4), healed lesions (long bones n =?10; ribs n =?9), or a fracture callus (long bones n =?9; ribs n =?3). Results were compared to stable isotope ratios calculated for regions on these bones that did not retain evidence of disease or fracture. Results Long bones with active lesions had a significantly higher average δ15N (δ15N = 11.1?±?0.9?) compared to those without lesions (δ15N = 10.7?±?0.7?; p =?.02), while fracture calluses showed the largest range for both δ15N and δ13C. There were no significant differences in stable isotope ratios when compared between nonlesion and lesion sites in the ribs. Discussion The increase in δ15N seen in active lesions, when compared with δ15N from nonlesion regions on the same long bone, may be a consequence of altered protein metabolism. The high variability of δ15N and δ13C in fractures may be related to different healing stages of the calluses. This study suggests that stable isotope data can contribute information about diseases in the past, as well as an individual's response to diseases in the absence of modern medicine and antibiotics.

AB  - Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a life-sustaining therapy providing nutrients to individuals with impaired intestinal tract function and enteral access challenges. It is one of the most complex prescriptions written routinely in the hospital and home care settings. This article is to aid the nutrition support clinician in the safe provision of PN, including selecting appropriate patients for PN, vascular access, development of a PN admixture, appropriate therapy monitoring, recognition of preparation options, and awareness of preparation and stability concerns.

AB  - Abstract Background The aim of this study was to examine the causes of cardiac tamponade in children undergoing percutaneous pericardiocentesis. Method Patients who presented with other complaints but were diagnosed with cardiac tamponade based on clinical and echocardiographic findings between January 2010 and January 2013 were retrospectively investigated. Electrocardiography, telecardiography and transthoracic echocardiography were performed. Pericardiocentesis was performed percutaneously under continuous blood pressure and rhythm monitoring with echocardiography and fluoroscopy. Pericardial fluid was analyzed on hemography and biochemistry. Results Fourteen patients (six boys, eight girls; median age, 7 years) underwent pericardiocentesis for cardiac tamponade. At presentation, 78% had dyspnea, 56% chest pain, and 49% fever. All had cardiomegaly, and their cardiothoracic index was 0.56?0.72. Also, all patients had sinus tachycardia; 78%, low QRS voltage; 70%, ST-T changes; and 50% QRS alternans. On echocardiography the widest diameter of pericardial effusion was between 12?mm and 36?mm depth around the heart. The pericardial fluid was purulent in one, serohemorrhagic in seven, serofibrinous in two, and serous in four cases. Pericardiocentesis was unsuccessful in two patients, who underwent open surgical drainage, with no complications. Based on pericardial fluid characteristics and additional tests, cardiac tamponade was caused by an infection in five patients, hypothyroidism in two, familial Mediterranean fever in two, malignancy in one, acute rheumatic fever in one, collagen tissue disease (systemic lupus erythematosus) in one, catheter placement-associated damage in one, and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension in one patient. Conclusion Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade in children have varied causes, and early treatment is life saving.

AB  - Summary This chapter covers all aspects of laboratory medicine including collection, handling, storage, and transport of specimens, as well as procedures and normal ranges. It gives information to understand and perform laboratory medicine. Blood chemistry tests are extremely useful diagnostic tools in veterinary medicine. They are used to evaluate various blood substances to help portray certain body and organ functions. Although many hospitals prefer to send out samples to reference laboratories for evaluation, the knowledge of how to perform a manual complete blood count can be very useful in certain situations, for example, when time is crucial during emergencies, when an automated machine is not functioning properly, or when an automated machine is not at hand. Having rapid results can give the veterinarian insight into the patient's hematologic status or provide information on certain types of anemia, organ functions, and neoplasia. The chapter describes the handling and collection techniques needed to obtain a proper microbial sample.
