AB  - Summary Varicose veins are common and aside from causing complications of aching heaviness, thrombophlebitis, bleeding and ulceration are generally regarded as being unsightly. Non-invasive duplex ultrasound can accurately diagnose sites of venous valve incompetence allowing targeted intervention. Aside from traditional surgery, innovative venous ablative therapies such as radiofrequency and endovenous laser ablation have been developed. With any venous intervention the risk of recurrence over time represents the major challenge. Lymphoedema of the lower limbs is a common cause of lower limb oedema. It is important to determine whether it is primary or secondary lymphoedema but the mainstay of therapy is conservative with elevation, remedial massage and compression garments.

AB  - Variation in water-holding capacity (WHC), which presents a major economic burden to the swine industry, is considered to be underpinned by variation at a molecular and biochemical level. High-resolution 2D DIGE followed by MS analysis and Western blot were used to unravel the proteome of muscle exudate, collected following centrifugation, in the pH 4?7 range. A first 2DE-based protein map of this substrate was produced where 89 spots were successfully characterised. Two phenotypes divergent for WHC plus one intermediate were compared with a view to deciphering the biochemical processes impacting on variation in WHC. Twenty spots were observed to be altered across the phenotypes. Of these, 14 represented sixteen proteins including metabolic enzymes, stress response proteins and structural proteins. Triosephosphate isomerase and transferrin showed a major difference between the two extreme phenotypes, and may have potential as biological markers for WHC prediction. Several members of the HSPs family were highlighted. This proteomic study makes an important contribution towards a more detailed molecular view of the processes behind WHC and will provide a valuable resource for future investigations.

AB  - Summary Objective? To compare the prevalence of genitourinary abnormalities in men diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI) in a Cameroonian hospital and those without. Patients and methods? Consecutive adult men aged 18?75?years, whose midstream urine samples were received for microscopy, culture and sensitivity at the microbiology laboratory of the Yaounde University Teaching Hospital, Cameroon, constituted the study population. Genitourinary abnormalities were diagnosed from history, physical examination, abdominal and transrectal ultrasonography, plain abdominal X-ray, and if indicated urethrocystoscopy and biopsy. Results? Of the 206 patients who qualified, 179 completed the study and 63 (35.2%) were found to have UTI. A total of 41 (65.1%) patients with UTI (mean age 69.2?years) had at least one genitourinary abnormality, compared to 13 (11.2%) of those without UTI (mean age 61.9?years) (P?<?0.001). The age-adjusted prevalence of genitourinary abnormalities was 59.4% in the UTI group and 12.1% in the non-UTI group (P?<?0.001). The most frequent genitourinary abnormality in men with UTI was benign prostatic enlargement, followed by urethral stricture. The crude odds ratio (95% confidence intervals) for UTI associated with genitourinary abnormality was 14.77 (6.80?32.05), and the adjusted odds ratio 11.51 (7.08?29.46). Conclusion? Urological evaluation of Cameroonian men with UTI, using simple history taking, physical examination, ultrasound examination and plain abdominal X-ray, could have significant clinical benefits in this tropical African region.

AB  - ABSTRACT Aim:? Despite significant advances in medical management and therapeutics, acute kidney injury (AKI) is still a common and serious complication with high morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients, especially in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The primary purpose of this study is to apply the definition proposed by the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) to investigate the incidence, 28-day mortality and risk factors for the prognosis of AKI in ICU. Methods:? In this retrospective study, data from a cohort of 4642 patients admitted to five ICUs were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate the risk factors for prognosis of AKI. Results:? A total of 1036 patients were enrolled. AKI occurred in 353 of them (34.1%) under the AKIN criteria and the mortality was 54.4%. Multivariable analysis showed that variables related to the prognosis of AKI were: four or more (â‰¥4) organ failed systems (odds ratio (OR)?=?25.612), AKI III (OR?=?14.441), AKI II (OR?=?4.491), mechanical ventilation (OR?=?7.201), sepsis (OR?=?4.552), severe acute pancreatitis (OR?=?3.299), base serum creatinine (OR?=?1.004) and the length of stay in ICU (OR?=?1.050). Conclusions:? For critically ill patient, the ICU mortality of AKI was correlated with various independent risk factors, especially AKI II, AKI III, severe acute pancreatitis and multiple organ failed systems.

AB  - Abstract:? Nitric oxide (NO) may aggravate neuronal damage after spinal cord injury (SCI). We hypothesized that NO produced by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) accelerates secondary damage to spinal tissue, which may be reversed by the neuroprotectant, melatonin. This study investigated the effects of combination therapy with melatonin (10?mg/kg) and exercise (10?m/min) on recovery from SCI caused by contusion. We examined locomotor recovery, iNOS gene expression, autophagic and apoptotic signaling, including Beclin-1, LC3, p53 and IKKÎ± protein expression and histological alterations in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Melatonin in combination with exercise resulted in significantly increased hindlimb movement (P?<?0.05), a reduced level of iNOS mRNA (P?<?0.05) and more motor neurons in the ventral horn, versus control SCI and SCI plus exercise alone, with no effect on the other signaling molecules examined. This study shows that combined therapy with melatonin and exercise reduces the degree of secondary damage associated with SCI in rats and supports the possible use of melatonin in combination with exercise to reduce the side effects related to exercise-induced fatigue and impairment.

AB  - This prospective, nonrandomized study was conducted to compare the increases in albumin and prealbumin concentrations in postoperative patients given adequate nutrition support. All surgery patients at least 18 years of age and who required parenteral nutrition were included. Of 86 patients evaluated, 16 met all criteria for study entry. Blood for albumin concentrations was drawn within 48 hours of beginning parenteral nutrition and then weekly. Blood for prealbumin concentrations was drawn within 48 hours of beginning parenteral nutrition and then twice weekly. Albumin concentrations increased from 2.00 Â± 0.35 to 2.21 Â± 0.42 g/dl (NS). Prealbumin concentrations increased from 11.97 Â± 6.31 to 17.29 Â± 8.93 mg/dl (p=0.017). All but one prealbumin concentration was in the normal range for our laboratory when parenteral nutrition was discontinued. None of the albumin concentrations were ever in the normal range. The prealbumin concentration is a better indicator than albumin of nutrition status in the postoperative patient. Since prealbumin concentrations typically rise into the normal range within a week after adequate caloric supplementation, clinicians may avoid unnecessary increases in protein-calorie intake and laboratory testing of nutrition status by using this measurement.

AB  - Summary This prospective study was designed to evaluate whether early changes in actin-free Gc-globulin levels were associated with complications and outcomes and to identify factors associated with persistent low actin-free Gc-globulin levels in acute liver failure (ALF). Thirty-two consecutive ALF patients admitted from October 2011 to December 2012 were followed up until death or complete recovery. All had serum actin-free Gc-globulin estimation at admission and at day three or expiry. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of mortality. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was also performed. Nonsurvivors had significantly lower median actin-free Gc-globulin levels than survivors (87.32 vs 180Â mg/L; PÂ <Â 0.001). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed an area under curve (AUC) of 0.771 and showed that serum actin-free Gc-globulin level of â‰¤124Â mg/L would predict mortality with 92% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity. Patients with lower serum actin-free Gc-globulin levels and decreasing trend in serum actin-free Gc-globulin levels were found to have more mortality and developed more complications. Logistic regression analysis showed that serum actin-free Gc-globulin, total leucocyte count and serum creatinine at admission were independent predictors of mortality. Incorporating these variables, a score predicting mortality risk at admission was derived. The scoring system was compared to MELD score and King's College Criteria as individual predictor of mortality. Serum actin-free Gc-globulin level at presentation is predictive of outcome and can be used for risk stratification. Its persistent low-level predicts mortality and is correlated with various complications.
