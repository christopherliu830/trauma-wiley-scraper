AB  - Summary Acute liver failure (ALF) is a medical emergency. Molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS), an artificial liver support system, can partly compensate for the detoxifying function of the liver by removing toxins from blood. To analyze the efficacy of MARS treatment, the outcomes of 113 ALF patients, treated with MARS between 2001 and 2007, were compared with a historical control group of 46 ALF patients treated without MARS between 1995 and 2001. Overall survival of transplanted patients was 94% in the MARS group and 77% in the control group (P?=?0.06). Without transplantation, survival was 66% and 40% (P?=?0.03), respectively. However, the etiological distribution of ALF differed significantly between the groups. In ALF patients with unknown etiology, groups were comparable at baseline; 91% and 69% of transplanted patients survived the MARS and control groups and the native liver recovered in 20% and 8% of the patients, respectively. Of the originally nonencephalopathic patients of unknown etiology, 36% underwent liver transplantation in the MARS group compared to 100% in the control group. Interpretation of the results was difficult in toxic etiology patients on account of differing baseline statuses. MARS treatment might partly explain the trend toward increased survival of ALF patients with unknown etiology.

AB  - Abstract Aim Acute kidney injury (AKI) carries an increasing incidence rate worldwide and increases the risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as well as the medical expenses during the post-AKI course. The Taiwan Consortium for Acute Kidney Injury and Renal Diseases (CAKs) has thus launched a nationwide epidemiology and prognosis of dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury (NEP-AKI-D) study, which prospectively enrols critically ill patients with AKI. Through thoroughly evaluating the risk and prognostic factors of AKI, we hope to lower the incidence of AKI and ESRD from the perspective of AKI-ESRD interaction. Methods The CAKs includes 30 hospitals which distribute widely through the four geographical regions (north, middle, south, and east) of Taiwan, and have a 1:1 ratio of medical centres to regional hospitals in each region. The NEP-AKI-D study enrols intensive care unit-based AKI patients who receive dialysis in the four seasonal sampled months (October 2014, along with January, April, and July 2015) in the included hospitals. The collected data include demographic information, pertaining laboratory results, dialysis settings and patient outcomes. The data are uploaded in a centre website and will be audited by on-site principal investigators, computer logic gates, and the CAKs staffs. The outcomes of interest are in-hospital mortality, dialysis-dependency and readmission rate within 90 days after discharge. Conclusion The NEP-AKI-D study enrols a large number of representative AKI patients throughout Taiwan. The results of the current study are expected to provide more insight into the risk and prognostic factors of AKI and further attenuated further chronic kidney disease transition.

AB  - This prospective, nonrandomized study was conducted to compare the increases in albumin and prealbumin concentrations in postoperative patients given adequate nutrition support. All surgery patients at least 18 years of age and who required parenteral nutrition were included. Of 86 patients evaluated, 16 met all criteria for study entry. Blood for albumin concentrations was drawn within 48 hours of beginning parenteral nutrition and then weekly. Blood for prealbumin concentrations was drawn within 48 hours of beginning parenteral nutrition and then twice weekly. Albumin concentrations increased from 2.00 ± 0.35 to 2.21 ± 0.42 g/dl (NS). Prealbumin concentrations increased from 11.97 ± 6.31 to 17.29 ± 8.93 mg/dl (p=0.017). All but one prealbumin concentration was in the normal range for our laboratory when parenteral nutrition was discontinued. None of the albumin concentrations were ever in the normal range. The prealbumin concentration is a better indicator than albumin of nutrition status in the postoperative patient. Since prealbumin concentrations typically rise into the normal range within a week after adequate caloric supplementation, clinicians may avoid unnecessary increases in protein-calorie intake and laboratory testing of nutrition status by using this measurement.

AB  - Summary This prospective study was designed to evaluate whether early changes in actin-free Gc-globulin levels were associated with complications and outcomes and to identify factors associated with persistent low actin-free Gc-globulin levels in acute liver failure (ALF). Thirty-two consecutive ALF patients admitted from October 2011 to December 2012 were followed up until death or complete recovery. All had serum actin-free Gc-globulin estimation at admission and at day three or expiry. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of mortality. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was also performed. Nonsurvivors had significantly lower median actin-free Gc-globulin levels than survivors (87.32 vs 180 mg/L; P < 0.001). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed an area under curve (AUC) of 0.771 and showed that serum actin-free Gc-globulin level of ≤124 mg/L would predict mortality with 92% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity. Patients with lower serum actin-free Gc-globulin levels and decreasing trend in serum actin-free Gc-globulin levels were found to have more mortality and developed more complications. Logistic regression analysis showed that serum actin-free Gc-globulin, total leucocyte count and serum creatinine at admission were independent predictors of mortality. Incorporating these variables, a score predicting mortality risk at admission was derived. The scoring system was compared to MELD score and King's College Criteria as individual predictor of mortality. Serum actin-free Gc-globulin level at presentation is predictive of outcome and can be used for risk stratification. Its persistent low-level predicts mortality and is correlated with various complications.

AB  - Summary This chapter emphasises the vital role the nurse plays in the prevention of progression to acute kidney injury (AKI) and of the delivery of care for the patient in AKI. In this central role the nurse can maintain close links with the patient's family, which can be instrumental to a family-centred approach to the patient's treatment. AKI may be divided into three major categories, in which each category has a physiological location of the insult: prerenal, renal, and postrenal. An acute impairment may also present in the patient with existing chronic kidney disease, which may lead to further structural damage; this presentation is often referred to as acute-on-chronic renal failure and evidence would indicate that this is an increasing group. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends performing urine dipstick testing for blood, protein, leucocytes, nitrites, and glucose in any patient in whom AKI is suspected as soon as possible.

AB  - SUMMARY:? Since 1998, by law, all school children in Korea must have an annual urinalysis. The first early morning urine specimen is examined by a simple dipstick method for the detection of proteinuria, haematuria and glucose. If a urine test is positive, a second test is performed by paediatric nephrologists. We analysed urinalysis data of school urinalysis screening. We also analysed the results of clinical data and the renal biopsy findings of patients referred to our medical centre due to abnormal urinalysis result. To date, about five million students have been screened since annual school urinalysis started in January 1998. Among them, isolated proteinuria was about 0.2%, occult blood was about 0.8%, and glucosuria was about 0.07% from January 1998 to December 2004. Among referred patients, renal biopsy was taken in 63.1% of isolated haematuria, 10.5% of isolated proteinuria and 69.9% of haematuria combined with proteinuria. Histopathological findings are IgA nephropathy in 43.8%, mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis in 38.4%, Henoch?Schönlein nephritis in 2.7%, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in 1.6% and lupus nephritis in 0.5%. Alport disease showed 0.6% as a hereditary disease. In conclusion, the school urinalysis screening could detect chronic renal disease in its early stage. Early detection using school urinalysis screening and confirmatory diagnosis by renal biopsy seems to be helpful for assessment of prognosis and intervention of chronic renal disease progression.

AB  - Summary This chapter explores how to approach joint pain from a rheumatological perspective. It presents the case examples of an on-call SHO bleeped to review a 60 year old lady with a hot, swollen, painful right wrist and a 55 year old lady referred to the Rheumatologist by the general practitioner with a two week history of painful, swollen left wrist joint. Reactive arthritis is often seen following gastrointestinal and genito-urinary infections with specific micro-organisms. Pre-existing rheumatological disease increases the risk of septic arthritis and although the leflunomide was stopped it has a long half-life conferring an immunosuppressed state. Erythema of the skin overlying the affected joint raises the probability of either septic arthritis or crystal arthropathy. Variability in disease presentation and disease evolution over time constantly revise SQs. Paying attention to the SQs in flux ensures that are consciously considering other possibilities.
