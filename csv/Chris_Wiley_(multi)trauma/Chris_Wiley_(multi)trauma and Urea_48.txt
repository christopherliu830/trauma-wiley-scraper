AB  - Abstract Outcome of acute renal failure (ARF) and use of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) have shown a consistently high mortality. (1) Evaluate the short-term patient survival. (2) Evaluate dialysis-free survival. (3) Evaluate risk factors associated with overall survival and the continued need for intermittent dialysis. We identified adults (≥18 years) needing CRRT, treated in the critical care units of Froedtert Medical and Lutheran Hospital from January 1, 2003 till December 31, 2005. Patients were divided into two major groups needing CRRT, end stage renal disease (ESRD) (chronic dialysis) and non-ESRD with ARF. Continuous renal replacement therapy was performed with an average of 2?L replacement fluid exchanges/h. Sigma stat software was used for analysis. Comparison was done for noncontinuous variables by chi-square and t test for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. A total of 110 (ESRD 24/non-ESRD 86) patients received CRRT during study period. Over all in-hospital mortality among non-ESRD patients was 63% vs. 46% for ESRD. Among non-ESRD patients who survived, 47% needed intermittent hemodialysis on intensive care unit discharge and 28% continued to need hemodialysis at last follow-up. Among non-ESRD patients alive at discharge, those who were dialysis dependent on last follow-up were older (64.5) than those who did not require dialysis on last follow-up (58.4) P=0.347. Non-ESRD patients who died were in the hospital for an average of 17.5 days compared with 29 days for those who were discharged from the hospital. Patients with ARF needing CRRT have high in-hospital mortality. A significant percentage of patients remained dialysis dependant on last follow-up.

AB  - Multiday endurance sports expose athletes to multiple physical stressors. Little is known about the athletes? physiological responses to these stressors. A detailed understanding of the serological changes that occur during competition may improve the treatment of athletes suffering from illness or injury. This prospective, observational study aimed to characterize serological changes in AR athletes across multiday competition. Athletes underwent venipuncture at the start, midpoint, and end of a 5-day, multidiscipline event. A variety of serological and inflammatory factors was measured and then analyzed to describe their changes over the course of the race. A total of 27 AR athletes (29.6% female, 70.4% male) met inclusion criteria out of 33 recruited initially. The mean age was 37.7 (IQR 32.5, 41). The median race time for athletes was 133 hours (IQR 123, 142). Serum creatinine, sodium, and potassium tended to remain stable as the race progressed. Conversely, serological measures, including hemoglobin, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein levels, tended to change substantially during the race. Participants demonstrated the ability to maintain homeostasis, despite significant physiological threat. Renal function, electrolyte balance, and hormonal profiles were stable. However, a pro-inflammatory response and decrease in red cell availability were evident by the midpoint of the race.

AB  - The ischemia-reperfusion seen in dogs with gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) could cause oxidative stress, decrease antioxidant capacity, and predispose patients to higher morbidity and mortality. Elevated lactate levels in dogs with GDV have been previously found to be a negative prognostic indicator. The purpose of this study was to serially evaluate oxidant and antioxidant concentrations in dogs with GDV and to determine if there is a correlation between the degree of antioxidant depletion and lactate levels. Dogs presenting to the Tufts Emergency Service that had not been treated with corticosteroids or fluids prior to admission and were not receiving antioxidant supplementation were eligible for the study. Blood samples were collected at the time of initial catheter placement pre-operatively (Time 0), and then 24 and 48 hours after surgery. The samples were analyzed for concentrations of oxidants [malondialdehyde (MDA), oxygen radical trapping capacity (ORAC) and F2 isoprostanes] and antioxidants (α-tocopherol, ? -tocopherol, vitamin C, and glutathione peroxidase). ANOVA with repeated measures was used to evaluate differences in the variables over the 48-hour period and Pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the relationship between 2 continuous variables. To date, 8 dogs have been enrolled in the study (1 female and 7 males, with a mean age of 8.0±2.2 years). All dogs have survived to discharge. The chart below indicates differences in parameters measured during hospitalization. Variable Time 0?median (range) 24 hours?median (range) 48 hours?median (range) P?Value MDA (nmol/L) 0.725 (0.532?1.250) 0.500 (0.423?0.870) 0.512 (0.388?0.890) 0.008 α-tocopherol (ug/ml) 16.350 (3.800?29.400) 11.300 (6.760?30.800) 12.950 (7.850?40.400) 0.000 ?-tocopherol (ug/ml) 0.402 (0.138?0.776) 0.293 (0.000?0.500) 0.300 (0.000?0.503) 0.501 Mean plasma lactate upon admission was 4.3?mmol/L (range 2.1?7.2?mmol/L). There was a positive correlation between ?-tocopherol and lactate (r=0.784, P=0.012) but there were no correlations between lactate and MDA or α-tocopherol. Additional dogs are currently being enrolled in the study and analyses of the other variables (ORAC, F2 isoprostanes, vitamin C, and glutathione peroxidase) are pending. These preliminary results support the hypothesis of alterations in oxidant and antioxidant parameters in dogs with GDV.

AB  - Objective: To determine if 1) administration of a neuroleptanalgesia sedative combination (hydromorphone-diazepam) would result in alteration of heart rate and fractional shortening parameters and 2) if administration of a neuroleptanalgesia sedative combination (hydromorphone-diazepam) prior to administration of a dissociative sedative combination (ketamine-diazepam) would blunt increases in heart rate and fractional shortening parameters previously reported with the use of dissociative-based sedation. Design: Single blinded, randomized, crossover design. Animals: Eleven privately owned healthy cats with normal echocardiograms. Procedure: All cats received each of the following injections with at least one week separating each treatment: Treatment A (TA) ? saline IM followed in 15?minutes by diazepam (0.2?mg/kg IM) and hydromorphone (0.2?mg/kg IM) combined in the same syringe; Treatment B (TB) ? saline IM followed in 15?minutes by ketamine (6?mg/kg IM) and diazepam (0.2?mg/kg IM) combined in the same syringe; Treatment C (TC) ? diazepam and hydromorphone combined in the same syringe followed in 15?minutes by ketamine and diazepam combined in the same syringe. Echocardiograms were performed using the right parasternal position 15?minutes after the second injection. Heart rate (HR) and parameters to determine fractional shortening (FS) in the short axis view were recorded in triplicate for each treatment group. An analysis of variance for repeated measures with a Fisher's LSD protected t-test was used for statistical analysis. Results: Fractional shortening was significantly increased in each treatment group compared to baseline (p<0.05). There was a significant increase in FS between TA and TB (p<0.05), TA and TC (p<0.05), but not between TB and TC (p=0.9). Heart rate was not significantly increased between baseline and TA. There was a significant increase in HR between baseline and both TB and TC (p<0.05), but not between TB and TC (p<0.05) Conclusion: The increase in fractional shortening induced by dissociative-based chemical restraint in normal cats is not blunted by the prior administration of a neuroleptanalgesia combination. The increase in fractional shortening following administration of the neuroleptanalgesia combination may have been due to an indirect increase in sympathetic tone (stress response).

AB  - Improved options for the successful transport of horses trapped in inaccessible areas (floodwater, steep ravines, etc.) during a disaster or emergency are available to practitioners using helicopter assets and the Anderson Sling?. Horses present a particularly difficult problem to remove from the rescue environment of a wide flooded area, or difficult steep terrain far from access by vehicles or heavy equipment. Due to their fractious and fearful nature, they may fight any effort to walk, climb or swim them to safety, and those attempts are inherently very dangerous for the rescuer(s). Unfortunately, many disaster or emergency scenarios may occur in areas not conducive to the use of other options (barge, rescue glide, simple vertical lift sling). Veterinary practitioners on scene should have familiarity with helicopter sling-load operations. The use of cargo nets, inappropriate home-made slings, and inadequate equipment has contributed to disastrous efforts by well-intentioned rescuers. There have even been desperate attempts at sling loading of cattle by roping the horns or one leg and transporting them into a waiting truck for removal from public lands. The Anderson Sling? has been successfully used for helicopter operations in multiple emergencies and training demonstration flights, and is the only Equine Sling recommended for this purpose. Although it was originally intended for clinical use in long-term recovery cases, it has become the industry standard for helicopter operations with equines because of its demonstrated safety margin, design and strength. In clinical use, leg straps further distribute the animal's weight to the legs, but are not necessary in rescue lifts. In some states, there are Large Animal Rescue Teams associated with the Veterinary School, the State Emergency Management Association, or local private Equine Ambulance Services that may have equipment and personnel trained in helicopter sling-loading. This is a specialty interest that requires prior coordination, significant planning, and training of all personnel involved.

AB  - An 8-year-old Pêga breed donkey that presented with a history of persistent enlargement of the right leg was diagnosed with a rhabdomyosarcoma by surgical exploration and biopsy. The tumoral mass involved the medial and posterior aspects of the thigh. At presentation, the donkey was extremely painful and reluctant to walk. Initial physical examination showed a heart rate of 60 beats/min, respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min, and a rectal temperature of 100.2°F. Venous blood was collected for a CBC and biochemistry. Postoperative care included antibiotic (potassium penicillin and gentamicin) and anti-inflammatory (phenylbutazone and dexamethasone). The donkey was very painful in the immediate postoperative period and developed dehiscence of the incision. It was unable to bear weight on the affected limb, very reluctant to walk, and lying down in sternal recumbency most of the time. Heart and respiratory rates ranged from 60 to 90 and 20 to 32, respectively. Because of the poor prognosis, euthanasia was indicated but the owner decided to keep the donkey alive to try semen collection. In order to improve life quality and making the semen collection possible, the anti-inflammatory therapy was stopped and an analgesic therapy with epidural opioids was selected. A 20-gauge epidural catheter was inserted in the first intercoccygeal space through an epidural Huber point needle. With the purpose of reaching the lumbosacral area, 20?cm of the catheter was advanced cranially from the needle tip. During 3 days, a combination of morphine (0.1?mg/kg) and tramadol (0.5?mg/kg) was administered daily with a total volume of 20?ml. During the first 24 hours after the first administration, heart rate ranged from 62 to 64 and respiratory rate from 20 to 24. It was not observed to have any adverse effect. The donkey improved during treatment standing most of the time and eating better. It was easier to hand walk, although it was not completely able to bear weight in the affected limb. Even during treatment, the donkey reacted intensely when the surgical area in the caudal aspect of the thigh was manipulated. On the forth day, it tried to copulate and semen was successfully collected by manipulation of the penis. As the semen was not classified as good enough to be frozen, the donkey was euthanatized. On post-mortem examination, the position of the catheter in the epidural canal was observed and 20?ml of methylene blue solution injected through the catheter before euthanasia. It was enough to totally stain the segment of epidural canal from the first intercoccygeal space to the lumbosacral joint. The opioid epidural analgesic therapy reported here was considered to be efficient to treat the painful condition of the donkey, but it was not able to completely abolish the pain.

AB  - Abstract The scientific knowledge base that supports clinical decisions about perioperative fluid management continues to evolve. However, despite these advancements in the understanding of the physiology of fluid replacement, the definition of ??optimal?? perioperative fluid management remains a matter of clinical judgment. With an appreciation of the many factors, both sensible and insensible, that contribute to changes in blood and extracellular fluid volume during surgery, clinicians have tried to create reproducible and generally applicable formulas for replacement of fluid during surgery. These formulas have been challenged recently by the introduction of new tools for monitoring cardiopulmonary function, by the implementation of monitor-guided protocols for fluid management, and, more recently, by clinical data suggesting that fluid restriction may improve surgical outcomes in some clinical settings. The relative ease of pre-identified fluid replacement protocols is being slowly replaced by data-guided interventions that take into account a variety of factors. Clinicians are therefore required to tailor their fluid replacement strategies based on preoperative patient characteristics, the type of surgery and even the type of anesthetic that is utilized. Some of the benefits of this new approach range from relatively ??minor?? outcomes such as diminished nausea after surgery to preventing postoperative complications such as wound breakdown and cardiopulmonary failure.

AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on the conditions more commonly encountered, either in medical examinations or in clinical practice, and attempts to provide a framework for developing an understanding of their pathological basis and diagnosis. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) can be used in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM) and to distinguish between the other causes of hyperglycaemia. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening acute complication of DM, occurring when insulin therapy is absent or becomes inadequate for the current physiological state. Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a condition associated with either abnormal antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion from the posterior pituitary (central) or an abnormal renal response to ADH. Cortisol is a corticosteroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex. Cushing's syndrome is caused by an excess of glucocorticoids. Multiple endocrine neoplasia is a rare syndrome involving the development of either multiple endocrine gland tumours or hyperplasia.

AB  - Abstract Background Neurosurgical intensive care unit patients are at high risk for delirium. A risk prediction model could help the staff screen for patients at high risk for delirium. On the basis of this risk, preventive measures could be taken to reduce the undesired effects of delirium. Objectives To establish a delirium prediction model for neurosurgical intensive care unit patients and to verify the sensitivity and specificity of this model. Design A prospective, observational, single-centre study. Methods Data were collected from a total of 310 patients admitted to the neurosurgery intensive care unit between January 2017 and February 2018. A risk factor prediction model was then created using multivariate logistic regression. Further data were collected from another 60 patients between March 2018 and June 2018 to validate the model. Results The model consisted of six predictors, namely, cognitive dysfunction on admission, fever, hypoalbuminaemia, abnormal liver function, sedative use four or more times, and physical restraint. The area under the curve of the model was 0.80, with sensitivity and specificity of 0.68 and 0.83, respectively. Conclusions This study established a delirium prediction model for neurosurgical intensive care unit patients, which we believe would help focused prevention of delirium in intensive care unit patients.

AB  - Summary The idea that mental disorders may be the result of bodily disease acting on the brain has been current for at least a millennium, since the time of Avicenna. Numerous attempts to relate specific psychological reactions to particular physical disorders have been unsuccessful, however, and it now seems clear that some general mechanism affecting the chemical environment of the brain is responsible. The clinician dealing with a mentally disturbed patient must consider any process capable of interfering with cerebral metabolism or neurotransmission as a possible causal factor. Moreover, for reasons still not well understood, the probability of a mental disorder arising from a ?physical? cause is greatly increased in old age. The aim of the physician when confronted with a mentally ill patient should be to answer two questions: Could there be a physical cause for the mental disturbance? Is there any physical condition that is making things worse?
