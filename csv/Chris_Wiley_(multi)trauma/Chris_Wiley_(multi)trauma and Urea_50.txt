AB  - The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the management and outcome of 10 cases of severe fulminant mitral regurgitation (MR) treated with SNP at the Animal Emergency Center between June of 1997 and August of 2000. The presence of acute respiratory distress with echocardiograph findings consistent with mitral regurgitation; no response to oxygen, lasix, and nitroglycerine ointment after 2?4 hours; and radiographic evidence that over 75% of the lung fields were involved defined dogs with severe fulminant MR. SNP was started at a dose of 1 ?g/kg/min. The dogs were monitored every 15?min by Doppler blood pressure, mucous membrane color, capillary refill time, respiratory rate, and auscultation of the lungs for respiratory crackles were recorded. If the blood pressure remained above 90?mmHg systolic and increased lung sounds were present, the dose of SNP was increased by 1??g/kg/min every 15?min until respiratory crackles were reduced. These dogs were then maintained on that dose of SNP during what was called the ?maintenance period?. During this maintenance period, they were evaluated for signs of respiratory distress and blood pressure monitoring was recorded every 2 hours. The dogs were started on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor during the maintenance period, and slowly tapered off the SNP. If the blood pressure decreased below 90?mmHg systolic, the dose of SNP was reduced to the previous dose. Eight dogs survived to discharge, one dog died 1 hour after starting SNP, and one dog was euthanized after 2 hours of SNP treatment. In the 8 dogs that survived, respiratory distress improved within 2 hours in 7 dogs (mean: 1.69, median: 2, range: 1.15?2) at a SNP dose of 1?3 ?g/kg/hr (mean: 1.75, median: 1.5 and range: 1?3). Respiratory distress improved in one dog within 6 hours on SNP at a dose of 5 ?g/kg/hr. In the survival group, SNP was maintained for 9?20 hours (mean: 14, median: 13 and range: 9?22). The taper of SNP occurred over 2?3 hours (mean: 4.2, median: 3 and range: 0?14) in 7 of the dogs that survived. One dog was tapered over 14 hours due to periodic episodes of hypotension and respiratory distress. The results suggest that use of SNP for treatment of dogs with CHF secondary to MR resulted in improvement in respiratory distress in 8 of the 10 dogs evaluated, and may be an effective alternative therapy for dogs with severe refractory CHF due to MR.

AB  - Objective: To retrospectively evaluate the indications, management and outcome of 152 cases of long-term positive pressure ventilation (PPV). Methods: Medical records of patients maintained on PPV for 24 hours or longer, from 1991 to 2001 were reviewed. All cases were categorized into 3 groups according to the reason they required PPV: animals with pulmonary parenchymal disease that were not adequately oxygenating (1), animals with neuromuscular or large airway disease that were not adequately ventilating (2), or animals with both inadequate oxygenation and ventilation (3). Results: A total of 152 ventilator episodes were identified represented by 124 dogs and 24 cats. The median duration of ventilation was 49 hours (range 24?356 hours). Overall, 41.4% of cases were weaned, and 27% of cases survived to discharge. There were 78 cases with inadequate oxygenation (Group 1), of which 37.2% were weaned and 20.5% survived to discharge. There were 62 cases with inadequate ventilation (Group 2), of which 50% were weaned and 38.7% survived to discharge. In Group 3, 10 cases were identified; 25% were weaned and 8.3% survived to discharge. Arterial blood gases were collected in 61.2% of cases prior to PPV. Venous blood gases were collected in 10.5% of cases and an SpO2 was recorded on 2% of cases. In 26.3% of cases, no blood gas or SpO2 measurements were performed prior to PPV. The mean PaCO2 prior to PPV was 46.9±15.5?mmHg in Group 1, 72.6±26.9?mmHg in Group 2, and 64.3±14.1?mmHg in Group 3. In Groups 1, 2 and 3, the mean PaO2/FIO2 ratio was 101.7±67.6, 262.6±210.9 and 115.7±75.9, respectively. Pentobarbital, with or without diazepam, was the most common induction (28.9%) and maintenance (61.8%) agent utilized. Most cases (91.4%) were initially stabilized with volume or pressure control. Of the animals weaned from PPV, synchronous intermittent mandatory ventilation was used in 46% of cases and continuous positive airway pressure was used in 22.2%. Complications included pneumothorax (6.6%), oral ulceration (5.9%), and corneal ulceration (3.9%). Conclusion: Long-term PPV can be both practical and successful in veterinary medicine. Patients that require PPV due to pulmonary parenchymal disease had lower weaning and survival rates than those without.

AB  - Introduction: The study objective was to describe the underlying diseases, predisposing factors, clinical signs and clinicopathologic abnormalities associated with thromboembolic disease of non-cardiogenic origin in cats. Study Design: Necropsy-based retrospective study (1991?2002) Results: Forty-eight cats with thromboemboli that were not associated with significant structural heart disease were identified in a retrospective study using case records from the small animal necropsy service of the University of Pennsylvania, from 1991 to 2002. Thirty-five cats presented for non-specific signs such as lethargy and anorexia while others presented for signs such as paresis (10) or dyspnea (10) that were referable to the location of the thromboemboli. Thromboembolic disease was suspected clinically in 12 of 48 cats. In cases where a single predisposing factor could be identified, thromboemboli were associated with neoplastic (9), infectious (7) and inflammatory (3) disease. Thirteen cats had multiple predisposing factors and no obvious predisposing factor could be identified in 16 cats. The thromboemboli were found in the systemic arteries (12), systemic veins (9), both systemic arteries and veins (7), pulmonary vasculature (7) and in both the pulmonary and systemic circulation (13). Eleven cats either died at home, presented in respiratory or cardiac arrest, or arrested shortly after presentation to the emergency service. Two cats arrested later during hospitalization and the remainder were euthanized (35). No sex or breed disposition was found. There were no significant differences in serum biochemistries, coagulation profiles, lactate, Doppler blood pressure or rectal temperature when groups were compared by primary disorder. Cats with neoplasia as the underlying disorder were significantly older (median 13.5 years, p=0.04). Cats with infectious disease had statistically significant higher white blood cell counts (median 35,000/?l, p=0.03) and cats with inflammatory disease had significantly longer hospital stays (median 3 days, p=0.006). Conclusion: These results suggest that most cats with non-cardiac related thromboemboli often have multiple predisposing factors, non-specific signs and non-specific changes on laboratory parameters. More sensitive tests for hypercoagulability may aid in diagnosing thromboemboli in cats.

AB  - Introduction: The amount of oxygen in blood is an important measure of lung function. There are three ways to quantify the amount of oxygen in blood: 1) the oxygen tension (PO2); 2) the percent of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen (HbO2); and 3) the absolute content of oxygen in the blood (ContO2). PO2 is commonly measured. HbO2 and ContO2 are usually calculated from the normal human oxyhemoglobin relationship, but can be measured directly. The canine curve is similar to, but not the same as, that of humans. The purpose of this study was to compare, in dogs, direct measurements of HbO2 and ContO2 with analyzer-calculated values derived using the human oxyhemoglobin curve, and with hand-calculated values derived using a canine oxyhemoglobin curve. Materials And Methods: Arterial and jugular venous samples from 17 healthy dogs were analyzed by an ABL 705 blood gas and electrolyte analyzer, an OSM3 co-oximeter, and a LexO2con oxygen content analyzer. HbO2 was calculated from the measured PO2 using a published formula based on normal canine data (Reeves, 1982), and compared to measured and analyzer-calculated values. ContO2 values were calculated, and compared to measured and analyzer-calculated values. Means and standard deviations were compared by analysis of variance for repeated measures. Differences were considered significant at p<0.05. Results: Arterial HbO2 determined by the ABL 705 factory-programmed algorithm, reported by the OSM3 co-oximeter, and calculated from Reeves' canine formula were significantly different (97.1±0.57, 98.2±0.58, and 96.6±0.74, respectively). The calculated canine HbO2 was significantly lower than that measured by the OSM3 or calculated by the ABL for both arterial and jugular venous samples. Calculated and measured arterial and venous ContO2 were similar, as were arterial-venous ContO2 differences. However, values derived from the calculated canine HbO2 (canine-calculated) resulted in the greatest arterial-venous ContO2 difference. Conclusion: ABL-calculated and canine-calculated HbO2 were similar to measured values. Likewise, ABL-calculated, canine-calculated, and OSM3-calculated ContO2 were very similar to measured values. Although some of the values generated by the different methods are statistically significantly different, these differences are unlikely to be clinically important in the healthy dog.

AB  - Our laboratory developed a customized solution containing various free-radical scavengers, energy sources, and vasodilators in an attempt to attenuate intestinal injury following an ischemic insult. This solution has been evaluated with beneficial effects following low flow ischemia and reperfusion using in vitro and in vivo models using intra-arterial and intraluminal administration. In both investigations, the solution minimized morphologic injury and decreased transmucosal leakage of albumin. Objective: To determine if the systemic administration of the solution (GI Boost) had any clinical effect on normal horses, and to summarize the outcome of horses undergoing colic surgery that received the solution intravenously and intraluminally. Animals: 5 healthy adult horses and at the time of submission the outcomes of 10 horses undergoing abdominal surgery for colic. Methods: 2 L of GI Boost was administered at concentrations of 25%, 50%, and 75% intravenously (IV) to 5 normal horses. Parameters evaluated included CBC, chemistry panel, blood pressure, and physical examination. In 10 clinical cases, GI Boost was administered IV (intra-op and post-op) and intraluminally via the enterotomy. Results: The administration of GI Boost did not produce any clinical or hematologic abnormalities in normal cases. None of the clinical cases developed any complications associated with the use of the solution. The majority of horses were discharged from the hospital and 1 died following large colon rupture. Clinical Relevance: The administration of GI Boost may have a beneficial effect in horses presented for colic. Additional cases continue to be acquired to determine if this solution has a beneficial effect relative to traditional methods of treatment.

AB  - Objective: To demonstrate whether ECG changes induced by hyperkalemia correspond with previously described changes. Design: Prospective Animals: Eighteen dogs and 22 cats with serum potassium levels >5.5?mEq/L as the result of various disease processes. Procedure: Once hyperkalemia was documented, the following data were collected: ECG (n=40), total magnesium (mg/dl) (n=18), total calcium (mg/dl) (n=31), and venous blood gas (n=20). Animals were divided into 5 groups based on expected ECG's changes associated with hyperkalemia (mEq/L): Group 1- 5.5?6.5; Group 2- 6.6?7.0; Group 3- 7.1?8.5; Group 4- 8.6?10.0; Group 5- >10.0. ECG's were interpreted to determine if the rate, rhythm and changes in the P-QRS-T complex were similar to those previously reported. Results: Twelve ECGs demonstrated changes previously described, while 28 did not: Group 1 (n=7)- 1/7; Group 2 (n=2)- 0/2; Group 3 (n=14)- 4/14; Group 4 (n=6)- 3/6; Group 5 (n=11)- 4/11. Many ECG abnormalities not previously described were also identified such as atrioventricular dissociation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Blood gas analysis revealed acidemia (19/20) with severe acidemia (pH<7.2) in the majority (16/19). Hypocalcemia was documented (5/13) and most of these patents (4/5) were in Group 5. Hypermagnesemia was documented in the majority of patients (10/18), though not in one particular group. Clinical Implications: It is difficult to establish typical ECG changes in patients with hyperkalemia, which represents a departure from the historical description. Hypocalcemia may be involved with ECG changes and arrhythmias in Group 5. Hypermagnesemia causes electrocardiographic abnormalities similar to those described with hyperkalemia and therefore does not explain the results of this study. There likely are complex interactions with electrolytes and acid base abnormalities that affect ECG formation.

AB  - Objective: To determine the amount of time required to reach the highest concentrations of oxygen at the patient's face and to determine what these highest concentrations of oxygen were with various non-invasive methods of providing supplemental oxygen using a commercial oxygen content analyzer. Procedure: Three healthy cats and 3 healthy dogs were each individually given supplemental oxygen by 6 different means, each done at 2 rates (5?L and 15?L per minute). The methods tested were: 1) Plastic sheet over conventional cage door (PSCD); 2) Blow-by where the tubing delivering the oxygen was held 8?cm from the face (BB); 3) Large plastic bag covering the patient (BAG); 4) Anesthesia induction chamber (AIC); 5) Synder oxygen cage (SOC); and 6) Crowe Oxygen E-Collar (COC). Prior to the testing, the commercial oxygen content analyzer (Mini-Ox) was calibrated. Results: Significant repeatable differences were consistently observed between the 6 methods of oxygen delivery. Results of both 5?L and 15?L/min oxygen flow rates consistently indicated that the highest oxygen concentrations were achieved with the anesthesia induction chamber and large plastic bag with oxygen concentrations reaching approximately 95% and 90%, respectively between 5 to 15?min. The BAG method had the advantage of allowing additional room for patient manipulation and the ability to place intravenous catheters while continuing to give supplemental oxygen. The plastic sheet covering a conventional cage door provided oxygen concentrations of 50% and 60% at 15 and 45?min, respectively. The Crowe Oxygen E-Collar achieved oxygen concentrations of 70% in 1.5?min. Blow-by was found to be the simplest method. It increased FiO2 to 40% within 2?min. The Synder oxygen cage was able to achieve 45% oxygen concentration within 30?min with an oxygen flow rate of 15 L/min. It was able to achieve 60% at 45?min (similar to the plastic bag on the cage). Conclusion: The order of effectiveness of providing non-invasive oxygen supplementation, from the highest to the lowest concentrations, was AIC, BAG, COC, PSCD, SOC, and BB. The fastest to the slowest increases in oxygen concentrations followed the same order at both 5?L and 15?L/min oxygen flow rate and they were BB, COC, AIC, BAG, PSCD, and SOC. SOC was the most inefficient means of providing oxygen while AIC, BAG and COC were the most efficient.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish reference values of respiratory mechanics and diffusion capacity in awake llamas for the interpretation and diagnosis of respiratory disease in critically ill camelids. The following procedures were performed in 10 healthy adult llamas (2?9 years; 100?204?kg): Respiratory Inductive Plethysmography and Pneumotachography (RIP) for the assessment of thoraco-abdominal synchrony and airflow obstruction (Hoffman, J Appl Physiol 2001;91: 2767?75), diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) and functional residual capacity (FRC) via helium dilution, esophageal balloon-pneumotachography to determine pulmonary resistance (RL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn), as well as Monofrequency Forced Oscillatory Mechanics (FOM) (Young, J Appl Physiol 1994;76:2467?72) to establish respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs) at the oscillatory frequencies of 1,2,3,5 and 7?Hz. RIP was further performed in 3 camelid patients to determine the cause of respiratory failure. The results of conventional lung mechanics, FOM (1?Hz), DLCO and FRC in healthy llamas are listed in the table below. Rrs at 1?Hz (closest to breathing frequency) was positively correlated with RL (P=.05). The calculated mean resonant frequency was 3.37 (+/?0.68) Hz. RIP results showed a peak difference between plethysmographic flow (V'sum) and nasal flow (V'n) of 2.61 (+/?1.02) during expiration (PEsf), and 2.48 (+/?1.04) during inspiration (PIsf). The area difference between V'sum and V'n was 0.05 (+/?0.14) and 0.05 (+/?.04) during the first 25% of expiration (SFEx) and inspiration (SFIx), respectively. Noninvasive evaluation of respiratory mechanics in clinical patients was essential to establish severity, type and progression of respiratory disease, especially in camelids presenting for upper airway obstruction, pulmonary disease or thoraco-abdominal asynchrony.

AB  - It has been recognized that a percentage of clone calves suffer from persistent pulmonary hypertension of the neonate (PPHN). It has been proposed by some investigators that an imbalance between vasoconstrictors, such as endothelin (ET-1) and vasodilators (such as NO) are involved in the genesis of the problem. Additionally, some clone calves and human infants are refractory to more traditional therapy or require prolonged treatment for PPHN and these patients appear to have increased smooth muscle in their pulmonary small resistance vessels suggesting chronicity. ET-1 is a known mitogen of vascular smooth muscle. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate ET-1 concentrations in the blood of clone, the blood of their surrogate dams and in fetal fluids to investigate the utility of using these fluids for prepartum evaluation of the clone. Blood was collected from calves and their surrogates at the time of delivery into heparin tubes; the plasma was separated by centrifugation and frozen until assayed. Fetal fluid samples were also obtained and frozen. Endothelin-1 concentration was determined using a commercially available RIA. Oxygen-dependent calves were those calves requiring, at a minimum, intranasal oxygen insufflation at rates of 5 or more L/min to maintain SPO2 values of >90%. Samples were obtained from a total of 40 calves; 13 calves were considered to be oxygen dependent and 27 calves were deemed non-oxygen dependent. Plasma ET-1 concentrations tended to be larger in oxygen-dependent calves (2-sample T test; p=0.16). Fetal fluid ET-1 concentration was significantly larger in the oxygen-dependent group (2-sample T test; p=0.0003). No difference between groups was detected in ET-1 measured in the blood of the surrogates; however, maternal blood ET-1 concentration was weakly but significantly correlated with fetal fluid ET-1 concentration overall (Correlation=0.456; p=0.007) and the correlation was stronger within the oxygen dependent group (Correlation 0.780; p=0.002). These data suggest that ET-1 may play a role in pulmonary function abnormalities in clone calves in the immediate post-partum period.

AB  - Objective: To establish normal parameters of thromboelastography (TEG) in healthy adult cats. Background: Thromboelastography (TEG) is an in vitro test of coagulation that has been shown to be useful in humans, dogs and select species to identify and quantify alterations of hemostasis (e.g., hypercoagulable and hypocoagulable states). It has also been demonstrated to be useful in monitoring effects of anticoagulant therapies. This test has not been evaluated in cats. Methods: Blood was collected from 25 clinically normal cats by venipuncture using a 21 gauge?3 1/2 inch butterfly catheter and syringe for medial saphenous or jugular venipuncture. A single 1.8?mL sample in 3.8% Sodium Citrate (9:1) was collected from each cat. Recalcified whole blood was analyzed 30?minutes following collection with the TEG? 5000 analyzer (Haemoscope, Niles, IL). Analysis temperature was 37.6°C. TEG parameters recorded included: R-value (represents initial fibrin formation), K (time from R to standard fixed measure of clot firmness which represents contributions of platelets and fibrinogen), maximum amplitude (MA; represents absolute clot strength), and alpha angle (α; the slope of TEG tracing which represents rate of clot formation). The coagulation index (CI) was derived from the formula generated for humans to provide an overall assessment of whether the sample was hyper- or hypocoagulable. Results: Values for the 25 normal cat samples are reported as mean ±2 standard deviations. R=2.97; 1.23?4.72; K=1.54, 0.38?2.71; α=70.70, 57.76?83.65; MA=58.50, 45.26?71.74 and CI=2.27, 0.07?4.46. Compared to historical information obtained on normal dogs, cats have significantly shorter R and K and larger α, MA and CI. Conclusions: TEG does have reproducible performance when used to evaluate coagulation status in normal cats. Compared to dogs, normal cats favor a hypercoagulable state. Species-specific normal values are necessary for interpretation of TEG results. This test bears potential value for use in future experimental and clinical work to investigate hemostasis in cats receiving anticoagulant therapies or in cats suffering from diseases such as cardiomyopathy which are thought to be associated with altered coagulation status.

AB  - Pulse contour analysis is a relatively new method of continuously monitoring cardiac output. The objective of this study was to evaluate the suitability of the human algorithm for calculation of continuous cardiac output from the pulse waveform, for use in anaesthetised horses. Cardiac output was measured in 27 anaesthetised clinical cases comparing lithium dilution (LiDCO) with a preceding, calibrated cardiac output measured from the pulse waveform (PulseCO) using a commercial system (LiDCOplus, LiDCO Ltd., Cambridge, UK). These comparisons were repeated every 20?30?min. Positive inotropes or vasopressors were administered when clinically indicated. Cardiac output values obtained ranged from 15.2?52.2?L/min, with cardiac indices from 30.7?114.9?ml/kg/min. Eighty-nine comparisons were obtained. The mean bias was 0.24?ml/kg/min +/?6.48?ml/kg/min. The limits of agreement were ?12.72?13.2?ml/kg/min. The 95% confidence interval for the upper limit of agreement was 12.07?14.33?ml/kg/min and for the lower limit of agreement was ?11.59?13.85?ml/kg/min. Linear regression analysis demonstrated a correlation coefficient (r2) of 0.89 and produced an equation of PulseCO (mls kg?1 minute?1)=0.9226LiDCO (mls kg?1minute?1) +5.354. This method of pulse contour analysis is a relatively non-invasive and reliable way of monitoring continuous cardiac output in the horse under anaesthesia. The ability to easily continuously monitor cardiac output may improve morbidity and mortality in the anaesthetised horse.

AB  - A 15-point neurological score for foals was developed, and tested on foals (<8 days old) presenting to the Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center (n=75) and the Royal Veterinary College (n=11). The score consists of 2 scales, which are added together to provide the total score. The points and descriptors for the first scale are as follows: Bright, alert, nursing, follows mare (0); Depressed, nursing, follows mare (1); Depressed, nursing, wanders away from mare (2); Depressed, standing, not nursing, will not follow mare (3); Recumbent, able to maintain sternal recumbency part of the time, strong suckle reflex (4); Recumbent, unable to maintain sternal recumbency, suckle reflex (5); Recumbent, no suckle reflex, responds to finger in ear (6); Recumbent, no suckle reflex, legs extended most of the time and muscles tense (7); Comatose, muscles relaxed, no response to finger in ear (8). Foals with a physical cause of recumbency (e.g., flexural deformity) are scored on this scale as if they were standing. The second scale is as follows: No seizure activity (0); Single seizure of less than 10 seconds (3); Single seizure of more than 10 seconds or two seizures of less then 10 seconds (4); Multiple seizures (5); Status epilepticus (7). All scores were assigned at admission by a single investigator. The median admission neurological scores for hospital survivors and non-survivors, and for blood culture positive and negative foals were compared with the Mann Whitney U-test. The correlation of admission neurological scores and arterial lactate concentrations (measured on a NOVA Stat profile M or CCX analyzer) and mean arterial pressure (measured indirectly with a tail cuff) was tested with Spearman's rho coefficient. Analysis of these data was performed using SPSS version 12. Results for all tests were considered significant if the p value was less than 0.05. The median neurological score on admission of all 86 foals was 4, and the range was from 0 to 12. The median score of survivors (2) was less than that of non-survivors (5) (p<0.001; n=86). There was no significant difference in median score between blood culture positive (4) and negative (3) foals (p=0.109; n=84). The neurological score was moderately correlated with admission lactate concentration (correlation coefficient 0.528, p<0.001, n=68), but only weakly correlated with mean arterial pressure (correlation coefficient ?0.285, p=0.011, n=78). This neurological score is statistically associated with clinically important parameters (hospital survival, blood lactate concentration), and warrants further study, including investigation of inter-observer variation in scoring.

AB  - Introduction: Mitral valve disease (MVD) is the most common acquired heart disease in dogs. When it results in congestive heart failure (CHF), MVD becomes an important cause of morbidity and mortality in dogs. Markers for determining the severity of cardiac injury and the heart's response to therapy might provide valuable information regarding the overall prognosis early in the course of CHF. This information might also provide a means for identifying those dogs with MVD that are at risk for CHF and those that might benefit from specific therapeutic interventions. In this study, we propose to investigate markers of cardiac myocyte injury in dogs that present in advanced (or Class IV) CHF due to MVD. Cardiac troponin I (CTnI) and cardiac troponin T (CTnT) are markers specific for cardiac myocyte damage, and serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP and pro-BNP), for myocyte stretch. These markers have shown predictive value in human and veterinary medicine, however further investigation is required. It is our hypothesis that one or more of these markers will be elevated at presentation compared to established laboratory normal values. Methods: Fifteen dogs that presented with Class IV CHF due to MVD based on physical examination findings, thoracic radiographs, and cardiac ultrasound had a blood sample drawn to measure serum levels of CTnT, CTnI and BNP, and pro-BNP at a commercial laboratory using immunoassays. Results: Our results show that 1 of 15 dogs had an elevated CTnT, 6 had an elevated CTnI, 0 had an elevated pro-BNP, and 3 had and elevated BNP level above laboratory normal values. Conclusions: There was no consistent elevation of CTnI, CTnT, BNP or pro-BNP in dogs with class IV CHF due to MR at time of presentation. Further studies need to be performed to evaluate these makers in dogs with CHF due to MR at varying intervals after admission to determine their potential benefits as markers of cardiac injury and response to therapy.

AB  - Abstract Objective: This report describes the perioperative management of a dog with a right adrenal pheochromocytoma that presented with acute retroperitoneal hemorrhage, cardiac arrhythmia and hypertension. Additionally, a summary of pheochromocytoma and the idiosyncrasies of perioperative management of a pheochromocytoma are provided. Summary: A 7-year old male, neutered, Dalmation was presented for acute collapse, abdominal pain and tachycardia. Physical examination findings were consistent with hypoperfusion concurrent with multiple cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension. Abdominal ultrasound revealed retroperitoneal effusion and a right adrenal mass intimately associated with the caudal vena cava. Incomplete right adrenalectomy was performed. Histopathology confirmed a pheochromocytoma. Unique information provided: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first definitive report of acute retroperitoneal hemorrhage as the initial clinical manifestation of histologically confirmed adrenal pheochromocytoma in the dog.
