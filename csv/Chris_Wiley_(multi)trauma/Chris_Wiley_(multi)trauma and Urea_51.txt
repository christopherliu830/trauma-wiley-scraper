AB  - Abstract Background Knowledge about patients with acute liver failure (ALF) in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) is lacking. Aims To evaluate whether the pattern of ALF would be similar to previous studies and whether, despite potentially low transplantation rates, mortality would be comparable. Methods We obtained data from the ANZ Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database and the ANZ Liver Transplant Registry for 10 years commencing 2005 and analysed for patient outcomes. Results During the study period, 1?022?698 adults were admitted to intensive care units across ANZ, of which 723 had ALF. The estimated annual incidence of ALF over this period was 3.4/million people and increased over time (P = 0.001). ALF patients had high illness severity (Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation III 79.8 vs 50.1 in non-ALF patients; P < 0.0001) and were more likely to be younger, female, pregnant and immunosuppressed. ALF was an independent predictor of mortality (odds ratio 1.5 (1.26?1.79); P < 0.0001). At less than 23%, the use of liver transplantation was low, but the mortality of 39% was similar to previous studies. Conclusions ALF is a rare but increasing diagnosis in ANZ intensive care units. Low transplantation rates in ANZ for ALF do not appear to be associated with higher mortality rates than reported in the literature.

AB  - Summary Bilirubin, bile acids, ammonia, and lactate are four substances measured in the blood for equine laboratory diagnostic purposes. Serum bilirubin quantitation is usually performed as part of a complete serum biochemical profile, while serum bile acids, ammonia, and lactate are ordered as individual tests, generally based on clinical suspicion for conditions that cause increases in blood content. For each analyte, this chapter discusses basic physiologic regulation, recommendations for sample collection and submission, and diagnostic applications and interpretation. Unique aspects of equine physiology present diagnostic challenges for the equine clinician. The also chapter addresses these challenges. Blood ammonia is most commonly measured as an indicator of liver dysfunction, typically when the animal has neurologic signs for which hepatic encephalopathy is a differential diagnosis. Horses with histopathologically confirmed liver disease and neurologic signs frequently have elevated blood ammonia, although values may transiently drop into the normal range as clinical signs wax and wane.

AB  - Abstract In an effort to identify tumor-associated proteins from plasma of tumor-bearing mice that may be used as diagnostic biomarkers, we developed a strategy that combines a tumor xenotransplantation model in nude mice with comparative proteomic technology. Five human cancer cell lines (SC-M1, HONE-1, CC-M1, OECM1, GBM 8401) derived from stomach, nasopharyngeal, colon, oral and brain cancers were subcutaneously inoculated into nude mice and compared to control nude mice injected with phosphate-buffered saline. One month later, plasma from mice inoculated with cancer cells was collected for proteomic analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS). Comparison of plasma 2-DE maps from tumor-bearing mice with those produced from control mice revealed the overexpression of several mouse acute phase proteins (APPs) such as haptoglobin. Another APP, serum amyloid A (SAA), was found only in mice bearing tumors induced by the stomach cancer cell line SC-M1, which has not previously been demonstrated in xenotransplatation experiment. Furthermore, by using immunohistochemistry, SAA and haptoglobin were found to originate from the mouse hosts and not from the human cancer cell line donors. The protein alterations were further confirmed on patients with stomach cancers where up-regulated levels of SAA were also observed. These results indicate that APPs may be used as nonspecific tumor-associated serum markers. SAA in particular may serve as a potential marker for detecting stomach cancer. Taken together, the combination of the xenotransplatation model in nude mice and proteomics analysis provided a valuable impact for clinical applications in cancer diagnostics. In addition, our findings demonstrate that a panel of APPs might serve as screening biomarkers for early cancer detection.

AB  - Abstract Many parameters currently used for the pre-transplant assessment of liver allografts, are not reliable enough in predicting the likelihood of early graft dysfunction or non-function. It is generally accepted that bile secretion is a sign of hepatic function post-transplant and that bile flow shows a close linear relationship to the secretion of bile acids (?apparent choleretic activity?). We have studied bile flow, biliary bile acid concentrations and composition and measured apparent choleretic activity from hepatic bile collected with a new technique under controlled conditions at the time of retrieval from 18 donor livers. More than three samples were collected from each of 13 donors and a total of 65 samples of hepatic bile were analysed. Of these, ten showed typical apparent choleretic activity with a positive slope in the regression line analysis (correlation coefficient of 0.9), validating our collection technique.

AB  - Abstract:? Central vein occlusion (CVO) is not uncommonly observed after hemodialysis (HD) catheter placement and it may prevent subsequent ipsilateral arteriovenous (AV) access creation. Right internal jugular vein catheterization (RJVC) appears to be the insertion site with the lowest incidence of CVO, but little is known about the incidence of CVO following left internal jugular vein catheterization (LJVC). We report on four patients with left innominate vein occlusion after LJVC who developed severe arm swelling after ipsilateral AV access creation. In three of the four cases swelling appeared 12?26 months after access creation, and in the fourth, swelling developed immediately after surgery while the catheter was still in place. Two patients underwent access ligation and in the remainder the arm swelling improved either spontaneously or after LJVC removal. LJVC is not as safe as RJVC as an insertion route for HD catheter placement in terms of CVO frequency.
