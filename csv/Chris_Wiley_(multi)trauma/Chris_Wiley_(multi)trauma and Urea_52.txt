AB  - Summary Acute abdominal pain accounts for 5% of visits to the emergency department. Although most patients presenting with acute abdominal pain have minor problems, about 18?25% of patients have a serious enough condition to warrant hospital admission for investigation and treatment, and about 10% of patients need emergency or urgent surgery. It usually results from gastrointestinal disorders, but other causes, which include a spectrum of medical and surgical conditions, must not be forgotten. Most commonly, acute abdominal pain is due to luminal obstruction, inflammation, perforation, volvulus or torsion, and intestinal ischemia. The two immediate goals in the diagnosis of acute abdominal pain are to decide if the patient needs admission to hospital and to ascertain whether urgent or emergency surgery is needed. A number of tests and investigations are available to guide the diagnosis of acute abdominal pain, but only an astute clinician can obtain the information that is needed from a patient, choose the best investigations, and plan appropriate treatment. The desire to obtain an accurate preoperative diagnosis should not be allowed to delay therapeutic intervention in the critically ill or unstable patient.

AB  - Abstract Bone morphogenetic protein 3 (BMP3) is a potent osteoinductive growth factor belonging to the TGF-? superfamily. In this study, we engineered a recombinant BMP3 protein to include an auxiliary collagen-targeting domain derived from von Willebrand coagulation factor (vWF). The collagen-targeted BMP3 fusion protein (rhBMP3-C) was expressed in E. coli, purified from bacterial inclusion bodies, renatured under controlled redox conditions, and assayed for biological activity in vitro and in vivo. The renatured rhBMP3-C fusion protein bound tightly to collagen matrices and inhibited DNA synthesis in normal rat calvaria cells and in two out of three human osteosarcoma cell lines tested. Alkaline phosphatase activity was increased in rat calvarial cells and was decreased in osteosarcoma cells in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Collagen sponges impregnated with rhBMP3-C and implanted subcutaneously in Fischer-344 rats induced dose-dependent dystrophic calcification of the collagen matrix, with no evidence of ectopic bone formation. However, local injection of rhBMP3-C infused in a collagen suspension induced new bone formation on the periosteal surface of rat calvaria. Finally, in a rat cranial defect model, surgical implantation of rhBMP3-C arrayed on either collagen sponges or on porous ceramics coated with Type I collagen exhibited marked osteoinductive properties. Taken together, these results demonstrate the feasibility of engineering and manufacturing targeted-BMPs which exhibit an integral gain-of-function that may be exploited to therapeutic advantage in (i) the enhancement of effective local concentrations, (ii) the prevention of systemic biodistribution and side effects, and (iii) the design of improved osteoinductive matrices. ? 2002 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - Abstract Background Burn injury increases the body's metabolic demands, and therefore nutritional requirements. Provision of an adequate supply of nutrients is believed to lower the incidence of metabolic abnormalities, thus reducing septic morbidity, and improving survival rates. Enteral nutrition support is the best feeding method in a patient who is unable to achieve an adequate oral intake, but optimal timing of its introduction after burn injury (i.e. early versus late) needs to be established. The purpose of this review is to examine evidence for the effectiveness and safety of early versus late enteral nutrition support in adults with burn injury. Methods An examination of randomized and controlled clinical trials using various medical databases such as The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2006), MEDLINE (from 1950), CINHAL (from 1982) and EMBASE (from 1980). Results The trial evidence about the benefit of early enteral nutritional support on standardized clinical outcomes such as length of hospital stay and mortality remained inconclusive. Similarly, the question of whether early enteral feeding influenced or decreased metabolic rate, reduced septic and other complications remained uncertain. Conclusions Promising results suggest early enteral nutrition support may blunt the hypermetabolic response to thermal injury, but it is insufficient to provide clear guidelines for practice. Further research incorporating larger sample sizes and rigorous methodology that utilizes valid and reliable outcome measures is essential.
