AB  - Background: ?Ureteric stents have been used in urological practice for over 25?years and in many cases have become almost routine. The purpose of the present review is to highlight the uses, complications and risk management issues associated with their use. Methods: ?An extensive literature review was conducted and knowledge from past experience was accessed to give a summary of past and current ureteric stent use in urology. Results: ?Broadly, there are stone and non-stone indications for stenting. Complications may range from the commonly experienced ?stent syndrome? to the medico-legal dilemma of the forgotten stent. Risk management must be applied to all uses of stenting to minimize complications and achieve best practice. Conclusion: ?Although almost routine in many areas of urological practice, the complications and implications for risk management of ureteric stenting cannot be ignored.

PY  - 2010
AB  - Zolpidem (Stilnox) is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic drug of the imidazopyridine class intended for treatment of insomnia in humans. A 16-year-old neutered cat, weighing 3.8?kg, was presented with sudden onset of stupor, disorientation, severe ataxia, vomiting and hypersalivation. Symptomatic treatment was given when ingestion of 1.25?mg/kg zolpidem (half of a 10-mg tablet) was confirmed, because no information on the efficacy and safety of the use of flumazenil in the treatment of zolpidem poisoning in cats has been published to date. As zolpidem is prescribed with increasing frequency in humans, the occurrence of accidental poisonings of pets is likely to increase.

AB  - Summary In veterinary medicine, animals living at, or beyond, 75% of their life expectancy, are considered geriatric, but these geriatric patients will typically experience pain as any ?average aged? patient would. While physical changes associated with ageing may be common in the geriatric patient, some older animals may not exhibit these changes. Regardless of this sympathetic change, geriatric animals typically have other functional and anatomical changes within the central nervous system that may reduce their requirement for all analgesic drug classes. Therefore, required dosing of analgesics, including opioids, should be based on careful titration and close monitoring for response to treatment. The ageing cardiovascular changes should not be assumed in all geriatric patients as some are extremely fit and maintain an appropriate cardiac index for the reduced muscle mass and metabolic rate. Exercise tolerance is an important positive predictor of a successful anesthetic outcome.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Pleural infection is a condition commonly encountered by the respiratory physician. This review aims to provide the reader with an update on the most recent data regarding the epidemiology, microbiology, and the management of pleural infection. Data source Medline was searched for articles related to pleural infection using the terms ?pleural infection,? ?empyema,? and ?parapneumonic.? The search was limited to the years 1997-2017. Only human studies and reports in English were included. Results A rise in the incidence of pleural infection is seen worldwide. Despite the improvement in healthcare practices, the mortality from pleural infection remains high. The role of oral microflora in the etiology of pleural infection is firmly established. A concise review of the recent insights on the pathogenesis of pleural infections is presented. A particular focus is made on the role of tPA, DNAse and similar substances and their interaction with inflammatory cells and how this affects the pathogenesis and treatment of pleural infection. Conclusion Pleural infection is a common disease with significant morbidity and mortality, as well as a considerable economic burden. The role of medical management is expanding thanks to the widespread use of newer treatments.

AB  - Summary Inherited bleeding disorders affect between 1 in 1000 individuals for the most common disorder, von Willebrand Disease, to only 8 reported cases worldwide of alpha-2-antiplasmin deficiency. Those with an identifiable abnormality can be divided into disorders of coagulation factors (87%), platelet count and function (8%) and the fibrinolytic system (3%). Of the patients registered in the UK with a bleeding disorder, the remaining 2% are unclassifiable. In addition to bleeding symptoms, patients with an inherited bleeding disorder can manifest other abnormalities, making an accurate and complete diagnosis that reflects the underlying molecular pathology important. Although some inherited bleeding disorders can still be easily diagnosed through a combination of careful clinical assessment and laboratory assays of varying degrees of complexity, there are many where conventional approaches are inadequate. Improvements in phenotyping assays have enhanced our diagnostic armoury but genotyping now offers the most accurate and complete diagnosis for some of these conditions. The advent of next generation sequencing technology has meant that many genes can now be analysed routinely in clinical practice. Here, we discuss the different diagnostic tools currently available for inherited bleeding disorders and suggest that genotyping should be incorporated at an early stage in the diagnostic pathway.

AB  - Summary The aim of this chapter is to provide some basic information on the significance, value, and limitations of clinical laboratory safety data for patients participating in drug studies. The intended readership is staff working in clinical drug research, who may be concerned with the selection of laboratories and viewing their laboratory data and reports. It is also the author's wish that the chapter will prove of value to data managers, statisticians, and report writers, as well as clinical research associates and pharmaceutical physicians. Clinical laboratory medicine is a vast and complex discipline and of necessity this chapter is limited to the tests generally considered as ?safety profiles?. I review the pre-analytical factors that can affect clinical laboratory tests, the results of which are subject to analytical and biological variation. I discuss reference ranges, but place greater emphasis on the critical differences in laboratory test results from patient baseline values. I also include basis information on normal and abnormal test results for renal, liver, haematological, and thyroid function, lipid concentrations, and measurements relevant to bones. Finally, I recommend ways in which data from subjects in clinical studies can be interpreted and summarized. It is hoped that the document will answer some of the questions raised by clinical researchers. However, it is important to appreciate that in this specialist discipline experience is invaluable, and so communication with laboratory staff is the preferred route, rather than review of library literature by clinical research staff.
