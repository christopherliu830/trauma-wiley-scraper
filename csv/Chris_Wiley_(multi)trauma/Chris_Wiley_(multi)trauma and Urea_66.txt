AB  - Abstract Creatine (Cr), one of the most popular nutritional supplements among athletes, has been recently shown to prevent the cytotoxicity caused by different oxidative stressors in various mammalian cell lines, including C2C12 myoblasts, via a direct antioxidant activity. Here, the effect of Cr on the differentiating capacity of C2C12 cells exposed to H2O2 has been investigated. Differentiation into myotubes was monitored using morphological, ultrastructural, and molecular techniques. Treatment with H2O2 (1 h) not only caused a significant (30%) loss of cell viability, but also abrogated the myogenic ability of surviving C2C12. Cr-supplementation (24 h prior to H2O2 treatment) was found to prevent these effects. Interestingly, H2O2-challenged cells preconditioned with the established antioxidants trolox or N-acetyl-cysteine, although cytoprotected, did not display the same differentiating ability characterizing oxidatively-injured, Cr-supplemented cells. Besides acting as an antioxidant, Cr increased the level of muscle regulatory factors and IGF1 (an effect partly refractory to oxidative stress), the cellular availability of phosphocreatine and seemed to exert some mitochondrially-targeted protective activity. It is concluded that Cr preserves the myogenic ability of oxidatively injured C2C12 via a pleiotropic mechanism involving not only its antioxidant capacity, but also the contribution to cell energy charge and effects at the transcriptional level which common bona fide antioxidants lack.

AB  - Hepatic failure is a common feature of critical care. Most hepatic dysfunction in the ICU responds to medical management and metabolic support. The role of extracorporeal organ support in hepatic failure is not as well defined as it is in renal failure and pulmonary failure. Nevertheless, artificial organ support has been successful in the treatment of advanced liver failure. Hybrid bioartificial liver substitutes show great promise, especially as a bridge to liver transplant.

AB  - Abstract To investigate ageing-associated changes in cellular immunity, we recruited three groups of healthy subjects based on SENIEUR protocol criteria. In addition, 10 subjects were randomly selected from each group to isolate their T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells; T cell proliferation after phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation was determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assays. There were no marked differences in the absolute numbers of peripheral blood T cells, NK cells or B cells among the three groups (P?>?0.05). Also, no significant differences were noted in the numbers of CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells, or the CD4+/CD8+ ratios (P?>?0.05). After PHA stimulation, T cell proliferation was markedly increased, with the highest level in group C and the lowest level in group A (P?<?0.05). Cytokine-induced killer tumouricidal activities were also dramatically increased, with the highest activity in group C and the lowest activity in group A (P?<?0.05). Our findings suggest that the number of immune cells remains unchanged with advanced age. However, there is a trend for decreased cellular immunity with an increase in age.

AB  - ABSTRACT ?MALIGNANT HYPERTHERMIA (MH) usually is triggered during or after administration of commonly used general anesthetics, and it can result in death if left untreated. ?THE ONLY DEFINITIVE diagnostic test for MH is the caffeine halothane contracture test. A new molecular genetic diagnostic blood test may offer a less-invasive alternative for some patients. ?HYPERTHERMIA, the cardinal sign of MH, is a relatively late symptom. Other clinical signs include tachyarrhythmias, tachypnea, and acidosis. ?PERIOPERATIVE NURSES should perform MH risk assessments during routine preoperative interviews to identify patients at risk for MH crisis. Perioperative nurses must respond rapidly and ensure the cooperation of the OR team when dealing with MH. AORN J 83 (January 2006) 151?164.

AB  - Abstract Objectives Drainage after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) remains controversial because the risk for uncontrolled postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) must be balanced against the potential morbidity associated with prolonged and possibly unnecessary drainage. This study investigated the utility of the level of serum amylase on the night of surgery [postoperative day (PoD) 0 serum amylase] to predict POPF. Methods A total of 185 patients who underwent PD were studied. Occurrences of POPF were graded using the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) classification. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified a threshold value of PoD?0 serum amylase associated with clinically significant POPF (ISGPF Grades B and C) in a test cohort (n = 45). The accuracy of this threshold value was then tested in a validation cohort (n = 140). Results Overall, 43 (23.2%) patients developed clinically significant POPF. The threshold value of PoD?0 serum amylase for the identification of clinically significant POPF was ≥130?IU/l (P = 0.003). Serum amylase of <130?IU/l had a negative predictive value of 88.8% for clinically significant POPF (P < 0.001). Serum amylase of ≥130?IU/l on PoD?0 and a soft pancreatic parenchyma were independent risk factors for clinically significant POPF. Conclusions Postoperative day 0 serum amylase of <130?IU/l allows for the early and accurate categorization of patients at least risk for clinically significant POPF and may identify patients suitable for early drain removal.

AB  - Summary This section discusses therapy for infectious diseases of the dog and cat. There are a number of infectious diseases listed in this section as chapters. These include Acanthamoeba, Acinetobacter, Actinomyces and Aelorostrongylus abstrusus. This chapters presents details such as the description, zoonotic potential, microbiology/epidemiology, clinical disease, diagnosis, treatment, drug therapy and drug therapy alternatives of each infection discussed environmental exposure to Acanthamoeba is common and typically does not result in infection. Acanthamoeba from corneal samples of cats with refractory conjunctivitis and keratitis. Dogs may present with clinical signs similar to distemper. Mild ocular discharge, anorexia, lethargy, and fever may occur early. Acinetobacter is a gram negative coccobacillus. Aelorostrongylus abstrusus is the most common lungworm of cats and is found worldwide. Diagnosis of A. abstrusus should be considered in any cats with respiratory signs, particularly outdoor cats that hunt. Treatment is difficult and not always required.
