AB  - Saliva plays an important role in oral health monitoring, regulating and maintaining the integrity of the oral hard tissues and some soft tissues. This paper reviews the role of saliva, the prevalence of oral dryness and the consequent importance of salivary flow as well as the relationship between xerostomia and salivary gland hypofunction amongst the causes of oral dryness. Other aspects of oral conditions associated with saliva are also reviewed including Sjögren's Syndrome and oesophageal function. Finally, knowledge, and the current use of salivary tests and the utilisation of saliva as a diagnostic fluid are surveyed.

AB  - Summary This section discusses therapy for infectious diseases of the dog and cat. There are a number of infectious diseases listed in this section as chapters. These include Acanthamoeba, Acinetobacter, Actinomyces and Aelorostrongylus abstrusus. This chapters presents details such as the description, zoonotic potential, microbiology/epidemiology, clinical disease, diagnosis, treatment, drug therapy and drug therapy alternatives of each infection discussed environmental exposure to Acanthamoeba is common and typically does not result in infection. Acanthamoeba from corneal samples of cats with refractory conjunctivitis and keratitis. Dogs may present with clinical signs similar to distemper. Mild ocular discharge, anorexia, lethargy, and fever may occur early. Acinetobacter is a gram negative coccobacillus. Aelorostrongylus abstrusus is the most common lungworm of cats and is found worldwide. Diagnosis of A. abstrusus should be considered in any cats with respiratory signs, particularly outdoor cats that hunt. Treatment is difficult and not always required.

AB  - Abstract Acute kidney injury (AKI) is now well recognized as an independent risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality particularly when dialysis is needed. Although renal replacement therapy (RRT) has been used in AKI for more than five decades, there is no standard methodology to predict which AKI patients will need dialysis and who will recover renal function without requiring dialysis. The lack of consensus on what parameters should guide the decision to start dialysis has led to a wide variation in dialysis utilization. A contributing factor is the lack of studies in the modern era evaluating the relationship of timing of dialysis initiation and outcomes. Although listed as one of the top priorities in research on AKI, timing of dialysis initiation has not been included as a factor in large, randomized controlled trials in this area. In this review we will discuss the criteria that have been used to define early vs. late initiation in previous studies on dialysis initiation. In addition, we propose a patient-centered approach to define early and late initiation that could serve as framework for managing patients and for future studies in this area.

AB  - Key Clinical Message We present a child with bullous IgA vasculitis. Because skin biopsy showed epidermal vesicles with neutrophil infiltration and leukocytoclastic vasculitis in all layers of the dermis, with IgA deposits and tissue eosinophilia, extensive dermal infiltration of neutrophils may have led to both blistering eruptions and tissue eosinophilia in our patient.

AB  - Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2010; 32: 233?243 Summary Background? Hospital admissions for cirrhosis have been increasing in the United Kingdom, leading to increased pressure on intensive care (ICU) services. Outcome data for patients admitted to ICU are currently limited to transplant centre reports, with mortality rates exceeding 70%. These tertiary reports could fuel a negative bias when patients with cirrhosis are reviewed for ICU admission in secondary care. Aims? To determine whether disease severity and mortality rates in non-transplant general ICU are less severe than those reported by tertiary datasets. Methods? A prospective dual-centre non-transplant ICU study. Admissions were screened for cirrhosis and physiological and biochemical data were collected. Disease-specific and critical illness scoring systems were evaluated. Results? Cirrhosis was present in 137/4198 (3.3%) of ICU admissions. ICU and hospital mortality were 38% and 47%, respectively; median age 50 [43?59] years, 68% men, 72% alcoholic cirrhosis, median Child Pugh Score (CPS) 10 [8?11], Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) 18 [12?24], Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (APACHE II) 16 [13?22]. Conclusions? Mortality rates and disease staging were notably lower than in the published literature, suggesting that patients have a more favourable outlook than previously considered. Transplant centre data should therefore be interpreted with caution when evaluating the merits of intensive care admission for patients in general secondary care ICUs.
