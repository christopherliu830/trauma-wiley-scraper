AB  - Abstract Hepatocytes can be generated from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) using inducers such as chemical compounds and cytokines, but issues related to low differentiation efficiencies remain to be resolved. Recent work has shown that overexpression of lineage-specific transcription factors can directly cause cells phenotypic changes, including differentiation, trans-differentiation, and de-differentiation. We hypothesized that lentivirus-mediated constitutive expression of forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (Hnf4a) could promote inducing mouse ESCs to hepatocyte-likes cells. First, ESC lines that stably expressed Foxa2, Hnf4a, or Foxa2/Hnf4a were constructed via lentiviral expression vectors. Second, observations of cell morphology changes were made during the cell culture process, followed by experiments examining teratoma formation. Then, the effects of constitutive expression of Foxa2 and Hnf4a on hepatic differentiation and maturation were determined by measuring the marker gene expression levels of Albumin, α-fetoprotein, Cytokeratin18, and α1-antitrypsin. The results indicate that constitutive expression of Foxa2 and Hnf4a does not affect ESCs culture, teratoma formation, or the expression levels of the specific hepatocyte genes under autonomous differentiation. However, with some assistance from inducing factors, Foxa2 significantly increased the hepatic differentiation of ESCs, whereas the expression of Hnf4a alone or Foxa2/Hnf4a could not. Differentiated CCE-Foxa2 cells were more superior in expressing several liver-specific markers and protein, storing glycogen than differentiated CCE cells. Therefore, our method employing the transduction of Foxa2 would be a valuable tool for the efficient generation of functional hepatocytes derived from ESCs. J. Cell.

AB  - Abstract Proliferation of astrocytes plays an essential role during ontogeny and in the adult brain, where it occurs following trauma and in inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases as well as in normal, healthy mammals. The cellular mechanisms underlying glial proliferation remain poorly understood. As dopamine is known to modulate proliferation in different cell populations, we investigated the effects of dopamine on the proliferation of striatal astrocytes in vitro. We found that dopamine reduced proliferation. As proliferation involves, among other things, a change in cell volume, which normally comes with water movement across the membrane, water channels might represent a molecular target of the dopamine effect. Therefore we studied the effect of dopamine on aquaporin?4 (AQP4) expression, the main aquaporin subtype expressed in glial cells, and observed a down-regulation of the AQP4-M23 isoform. This down-regulation was the cause of the dopamine-induced decrease in proliferation as knockdown of AQP4 using siRNA techniques mimicked the effects of dopamine on proliferation. Furthermore, stimulation of glial proliferation by basic fibroblast growth factor was also abolished by knocking down AQP4. In addition, blocking of AQP4 with 10??m tetraethylammonium inhibited osmotically induced cell swelling and stimulation of glial cell proliferation by basic fibroblast growth factor. These results demonstrate a clear-cut involvement of AQP4 in the regulation of proliferation and implicate that modulation of AQP4 could be used therapeutically in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases as well as in the regulation of reactive astrogliosis by preventing or reducing the glia scar formation, thus improving regeneration following ischemia or other trauma.

AB  - Objective To identify risk factors for dehiscence in stapled functional end-to-end anastomoses (SFEEA) in dogs. Study Design Retrospective case series. Animals Dogs (n?=?53) requiring an enterectomy. Methods Medical records from a single institution for all dogs undergoing an enterectomy (2001?2012) were reviewed. Surgeries were included when gastrointestinal (GIA) and thoracoabdominal (TA) stapling equipment was used to create a functional end-to-end anastomosis between segments of small intestine or small and large intestine in dogs. Information regarding preoperative, surgical, and postoperative factors was recorded. Results Anastomotic dehiscence was noted in 6 of 53 cases (11%), with a mortality rate of 83%. The only preoperative factor significantly associated with dehiscence was the presence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Surgical factors significantly associated with dehiscence included the presence, duration, and number of intraoperative hypotensive periods, and location of anastomosis, with greater odds of dehiscence in anastomoses involving the large intestine. Conclusion IBD, location of anastomosis, and intraoperative hypotension are risk factors for intestinal anastomotic dehiscence after SFEEA in dogs. Previously suggested risk factors (low serum albumin concentration, preoperative septic peritonitis, and intestinal foreign body) were not confirmed in this study.

AB  - Summary This chapter helps the readers to identify the structured approach to the clinical assessment and initial care of a patient requiring transfer, using the ABCDEF (Airway assessment and control; Breathing; Circulation; Disability and Dextrose; Exposure and Everything else; Family) approach to structure primary and secondary surveys. The primary survey (for infants this is called the initial approach assessment and stabilisation of any potentially life-threatening problems) followed by the secondary survey (for infants called the reassessment and planning of definitive care) are outlined. When becoming involved with the care of a patient for potential transfer it is important to follow exactly the same rules that are applied as the initial responder to an emergency. This is delivered through the use of the ABCDEF structure using a primary survey to seek out and treat any potentially life-threatening problems followed by secondary survey ABCDEF reassessment and planning of definitive care.

AB  - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) is a rare clinical syndrome defined by the presence of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The etiology of TTP-HUS is diverse, and many cases remain idiopathic. Recognized causes include Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, quinine toxicity, certain cancers and cancer chemotherapy, antiphospholipid antibodies, pregnancy and OCP's, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, OKT3, antiplatelet agents, AIDS and HIV infection, and pneumococcal infection. After an extensive literature review, we found no cases of TTP-HUS following traumatic injury. We present the case of a 57-year-old white male hemodialysis patient with end-stage renal disease secondary to type 2 diabetes, severe CAD with multiple MI's, HTN, history of coronary artery bypass grafting ?4, and transmyocardial reperfusion. The patient fell in the bathroom with questionable LOC and was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnosed by head CT. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet-count falling from 181,000 to 6000), hemolytic anemia, mental status changes, and renal function abnormalities. He was treated by plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Of interest, we present another case of TTP-HUS following trauma. A 42-year-old white male with no applicable medical history fell 6 feet from a ladder, developing a renal hematoma. 4 days after the fall, he developed TTP-HUS. This patient was also treated with plasma exchange with subsequent improvement of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. Based on these two case studies, we suggest that hematoma be considered as a potential trigger in the development of TTP-HUS.

AB  - The pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis) is an IUCN Red List Endangered species (CITES Appendix II) that has been housed in zoological collections since 1912. As wild populations continue to decline throughout the species? range, successful ex situ breeding and management, including an understanding of morbidity and mortality, are of utmost importance. This study is the first comprehensive review of mortality data from the captive population since 1982 and significantly expands on previous analyses. We solicited necropsy reports from 129/187 zoological institutions worldwide that currently or previously held pygmy hippos and received data for 404 animals (177 ?, 220 ?, 7 undermined sex), representing 43% of pygmy hippos that have died in captivity. Mortality in neonates was primarily due to perinatal causes (51.8%?stillbirth, failure to thrive, weakness, poor suckling reflex, maternal neglect) or parent-inflicted trauma (28%). Common causes of mortality in adult and geriatric animals included cardiovascular disease (16%), degenerative musculoskeletal conditions (10%), obstructive gastrointestinal disease (9%), and renal insufficiency (13%), sometimes associated with advanced polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Although not the direct cause of mortality, a number of adult and geriatric pygmy hippos were also overweight to obese. Infectious causes of mortality in included leptospirosis and encephalomyocarditis virus, the latter usually presenting as acute death due to cardiovascular demise. This comprehensive overview presents a useful guide for recommendations in preventative veterinary care and for improved husbandry and management of pygmy hippos in captivity.

AB  - SUMMARY 1 Ischaemic preconditioning (IPC) protects the heart and kidneys against ischaemia?reperfusion (I/R) injury. It has been shown that opioid receptor activation can mimic cardiac IPC. In a kidney model of I/R, a single dose of morphine failed to mimic IPC. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of chronic morphine (dependence) in protection against renal I/R injury. 2 Male Wistar rats were treated with increasing doses of morphine (20?30 mg/kg per day, s.c., for 5 days) to develop morphine dependence (MD). Three weeks before the I/R procedure, the right kidney was removed. Ischaemia?reperfusion injury was induced by clamping the left renal artery for 45 min, followed by 24 h reperfusion. Some MD rats were pretreated with naloxone (5 mg/kg, s.c.). Twenty-four hours later, creatinine and sodium concentrations were measured in serum and urine, then creatinine clearance (CCr) and the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) were calculated. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was measured only in serum samples. Kidneys were also assessed histologically for evidence of tissue injury. 3 In the present study, MD decreased tissue injury (histological score), serum creatinine and BUN levels, increased CCr and decreased FENa after I/R. Pretreatment with naloxone attenuated the protective effects of MD. Morphine dependence did not have any significant effect on urine volume. 4 In conclusion, it seems that morphine dependence protects the kidney against I/R injury via opioid receptor-dependent pathways. Further studies are required to clearly determine the mechanisms involved.

AB  - Abstract Objective To provide a current review of the clinical characteristics, predictors and outcomes in critically ill patients presenting to the ED with acute pancreatitis and subsequently admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary referral centre in Australia. Methods A retrospective single-centre study of adult patients admitted with pancreatitis. Severe acute pancreatitis defined by Bedside Index of Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) score ≥2. Results Eighty-seven patients fulfilled criteria for inclusion during the study period, representing 0.9% of all ICU admissions. The median age of patients was 54. Survival was independent of patients? age, sex, aetiology and comorbidities. Mortality was 30.8% for both inpatient referrals to the ICU and for direct referrals via the ED. Higher mortality was identified among patients requiring mechanical ventilation (74.2 vs 24.6% in survivors; P?<?0.0001), vasopressor support (85.7 vs 33.8% in survivors; P?<?0.0001) or renal replacement therapy (60 vs 16.9% in survivors; P?<?0.002). BISAP score surpasses Ranson's and Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Examination (APACHE) II scores in discriminating between survivors and non-survivors among unselected patients with acute pancreatitis admitted to ICU, whereas APACHE II discriminates better in the cohort admitted from ED. Conclusion Severe acute pancreatitis is associated with high mortality. Aetiology and comorbidity did not predict adverse outcomes in this population. BISAP score is non-inferior to APACHE II score as a prognostic tool in critically ill patients with acute pancreatitis and could be used to triage admission. Evidence of persistent organ dysfunction and requirements for organ support reliably identify patients at high-risk of death.

AB  - The moisture contents of foods, fluids, and parenteral solutions taken in and of all samples excreted, the water of oxidation of fuel mixtures burned, and the evaporative water loss must be determined in order to obtain a quantitative picture of water balance. Because there is a tendency to retain water after trauma, surgery, or an acute illness, changes in the water compartment of the body may lead to changes in body weight that may be considered erroneously as changes in energy or protein stores. Measurement of water balance, in addition to calorie and nitrogen balance is one of the most accurate means of accounting for these changes in body composition. Fluid and electrolyte therapy and nutritional supplementation can be tailored to meet the patient's specific needs by utilizing this information. Application of these principles to the care of hospitalized patients outside of the research setting will be discussed.

AB  - SUMMARY 1. In the present study, we investigated whether treatment with α-lipoic acid (LA), a powerful and universal anti-oxidant, has renal protective effects in rats with ischaemic acute renal failure (ARF). 2. Ischaemic ARF was induced by occlusion of the left renal artery and vein for 45 min followed by reperfusion, 2 weeks after contralateral nephrectomy. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), plasma concentrations of creatinine (Pcr) and urinary osmolality (Uosm) were measured for the assessment of renal dysfunction. Creatinine clearance (Ccr) and fractional excretion of Na+ (FENa) were used as indicators of glomerular and tubular function, respectively. 3. Renal function in ARF rats decreased markedly 24 h after reperfusion. Intraperitoneal injection of LA at a dose of 10 mg/kg before the occlusion tended to attenuate the deterioration of renal function. A higher dose of LA (100 mg/kg) significantly (P < 0.01) attenuated the ischaemia/reperfusion-induced increases in BUN (19.1 ± 0.7 vs 7.2 ± 0.7 mmol/L before and after treatment, respectively), Pcr (290 ± 36 vs 78.1 ± 4.2 ?mol/L before and after treatment, respectively) and FENa (1.39 ± 0.3 vs 0.33 ± 0.09% before and after treatment, respectively). Treatment with 100 mg/kg LA significantly (P < 0.01) increased Ccr (0.70 ± 0.13 vs 2.98 ± 0.27 mL/min per kg before and after treatment, respectively) and Uosm (474 ± 39 vs 1096 ± 80 mOsmol/kg before and after treatment, respectively). 4. Histopathological examination of the kidney of ARF rats revealed severe lesions. Tubular necrosis (P < 0.01), proteinaceous casts in tubuli (P < 0.01) and medullary congestion (P < 0.05) were significantly suppressed by the higher dose of LA. 5. A marked increase in endothelin (ET)-1 content in the kidney after ischaemia/reperfusion was evident in ARF rats (0.43 ± 0.02 ng/g tissue) compared with findings in sham- operated rats (0.20 ± 0.01 ng/g tissue). Significant attenuation (P < 0.01) of this increase occurred in ARF rats treated with the higher dose of LA (0.24 ± 0.03 ng/g tissue). 6. These results suggest that administration of LA to rats prior to development of ischaemic ARF prevents renal dysfunction and tissue injury, possibly through the suppression of overproduction of ET-1 in the postischaemic kidney.

AB  - The production of jewellery is currently mostly industrial and the jewellers perform only one or two stages in the manufacturing process. The jewellers make jewellery by hand in small workshops and are more polyvalent: they shape the metal with pliers or hand tools or cast it in moulds, assemble the individual parts with glues, carve metal, diamonds and other stones, clean metals with soaps and ultrasonic baths. The occupational dermatitis is of irritant nature (acid and alkalis in metal cleaners, soaps, detergents, metal dust, abrasions from polishing wheels and emery paper, heat, adhesives, etc) and allergic nature (potassium dichromate, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, ammoniated mercury, carba mix, epoxy resin, mercapto mix, formaldehyde, nickel, colophony). We report the cases of two jewellers working in workshops. A 47 year old atopic woman already known for a sensitivity to metals (nickel, potassium dichromate and cobalt) developed recurrent vesiculo-pustular erythematous lesions of both palms with occasional infections treated with systemic antibiotics and topical steroids. Patch tests were performed for the European standard series, woods, and personal series. There were positive?+?reactions at 96?h to colophony, palladium, and personal waxes. Information obtained through the manufacturer revealed colophony in the waxes frequently used by jewellers to fix the precious stones to woods and metal allowing the stones to be carved. A 47 years old atopic man working as a jeweller for 32 years developed recurrent eczematous lesions of the fingers of the right hand. Patch tests were performed for the European standard series, preservatives, plastics, acrylates and personals series and were positive?+?+?at 96?h for urea formaldehyde, diethylenetriamine, araldite hardener and the soap used to clean the jewels. Uncommonly this contact allergy is not due to the epoxy resins themselves but to the hardener. The urea formaldehyde and the diethylenetriamine are in fact used as epoxy resins hardeners. There were no reactions to the araldite resin but there was one to its hardener. In conclusion we report two unusual cases of hand contact dermatitis in jewellers. Because jewellers are exposed to a variety of substances, to detect the allergens the inquiry must be accurate and extensive patch testing may be required. Common allergens are compounds of uncommon substances and tools and uncommon allergens are compounds of well-known sensitizers.

AB  - Objectives To describe, in a cohort of dogs with presumed primary immune-mediated neutropenia, the presenting clinical characteristics, haematology results, bone marrow characteristics, therapies used (drugs and doses), clinical response to treatment, relapse and outcome at six months and one year. Methods Multi-institutional recruited retrospective descriptive case series with voluntary submissions. Presumed immune-mediated neutropenia was diagnosed based on a neutrophil concentration <1·5?109 cells/L on a minimum of two complete blood counts, exclusion of other causes of neutropenia based on a diagnostic bone marrow aspirate or biopsy, and exclusion of secondary immune-mediated neutropenia. Dogs meeting these diagnostic criteria between 2006 and 2013, and that had a haematocrit of ≥29% and minimum of two complete blood clounts performed after initiation of therapy, were included. Results Information on 35 dogs was included. Neutropenia was less than 0·5?109 cells/L in most cases (21 dogs), 0·5 to ·99?109 cells/L in 11, and 1.0 to 1·49?109 cells/L in three. Eight dogs had thrombocytopenia, which was severe (<49·9?109 cells/L) in three. [Correction added on 23 May 2017, after first online publication: the cell numbers were incorrect due to errors in the conversion of cell measurements to international units. The numbers have been corrected throughout the article and Table 2.] Twenty-three dogs had myeloid hyperplasia, 10 dogs had myeloid hypoplasia and two dogs had normal myelopoiesis. Neutropenia resolved in 32 of 33 dogs within two weeks of starting corticosteroid therapy and in all dogs within one month. Relapse of neutropenia occurred in 12 cases within one year. Clinical Significance Initial response of presumed primary immune-mediated neutropenia cases to corticosteroid therapy can be excellent. Long-term monitoring for relapse is warranted because 34% of cases relapsed during or after taper of immunosuppressive medications.
