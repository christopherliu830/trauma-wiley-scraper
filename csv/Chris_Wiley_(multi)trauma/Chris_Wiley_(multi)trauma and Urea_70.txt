AB  - Abstract Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is now a routine therapy for advanced heart failure. Minimally invasive approach via thoracotomy for LVAD implantation is getting popular due to its potential advantage over the conventional sternotomy approach in terms of reduced risk at re-operation due to sternal sparing. We compared the approaches (thoracotomy and sternotomy) to determine the superiority. Minimally invasive approach involved fitting of the LVAD inflow cannula into left ventricle apex via left anterior thoracotomy and anastomosis of outflow graft to ascending aorta via right anterior thoracotomy. In the sternotomy approach, both the procedures were performed via sternotomy. Outcomes in patients after LVAD implantation were compared depending on these approaches for the surgery. Two hundred and five continuous flow LVAD implantations performed between July 2006 and June 2015 at a single center were divided based on surgical approach, that is, sternotomy (n?=?180) and thoracotomy (n?=?25) groups. There was no significant difference between the groups in relation to patient demographics, preoperative hemodynamic parameters, laboratory markers, or risk factors. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of postoperative hemodynamic parameters, laboratory markers, bleeding and requirement of blood products, intensive care unit, and hospital stay or complications of LVAD surgery. There were no significant differences in terms of long-term survival (Log-Rank P?=?0.953), however, thoracotomy, compared to sternotomy approach, incurred significantly less requirement of temporary right ventricular assist (4 vs. 19.4%, P?=?0.041). Minimally invasive bilateral thoracotomy approach for LVAD implantation in addition to benefits of sternal sparing avoids dilatation of right ventricle and reduces chances of right ventricular failure requiring temporary right ventricular assist.

AB  - Summary Exotic small mammals such as ferrets, rabbits, and rodents are popular companion animals. Given the paucity of information in the veterinary literature pertaining to transfusion medicine in exotic species, common principles of blood transfusion medicine and blood substitute therapy in mammals such as dogs and cats can sometimes be extrapolated to exotic small mammals. Blood transfusions are generally indicated to replace a deficiency of blood constituents such as red blood cells (RBCs), plasma, clotting factors, and platelets. Crossmatches are agglutination and hemolysis tests performed to assess donor-recipient compatibility, observing interactions between the donor and recipient RBCs and antibodies contained in the plasma. Blood banking is a common method of storage for feline and canine blood products, but it is not commonly practiced for exotic small mammals. Much of the information available is based on clinical experience and extrapolation from human, canine, and feline patients.

AB  - Background: Various inflammatory mediators have been identified as potential contributors to complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS1), but these mediators do not entirely explain certain manifestations of the syndrome, such as pain. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of amino acids in the pathogenesis of CRPS1. Methods: We used HPLC to determine plasma concentrations of 16 amino acids, especially those related to the NMDA receptor (e.g., glutamate and glycine) and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis (e.g., arginine and citrulline) in patients with CRPS1 (n=64) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n=51). Patients rated pain intensity (visual analog scale) and the subjective experience of pain intensity (McGill Pain Questionnaire). Psychological dysfunction was assessed using the SCL-90. Results: Relative to controls, in CRPS1 patients, plasma levels of glutamate, arginine, taurine, and glycine were increased, and plasma levels of glutamine and the ratio of citrulline to arginine were decreased. Remarkably, in CRPS1 patients there was a highly significant inverse correlation between glutamine and glutamate, although the sum of molar concentrations of glutamate and glutamine remains unchanged. Subjective measures of pain and indicators of psychoneuroticism and emotional instability did not correlate with amino acid levels. Conclusion: This study shows for the first time a pronounced increase in amino acid levels in this chronic pain syndrome. The marked differences in glutamate, glutamine, glycine, taurine and arginine levels between patients and controls suggest the involvement of both the NDMA receptor and the endothelium-dependent arginine-NO system in CRPS1.

AB  - Abstract Keratin (K) intermediate filament proteins form cytoskeletal scaffolds in epithelia, the disruption of which leads to a large number of human disorders. KRT5 or KRT14 mutations cause epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS). The considerable intra- and interfamilial variability in EBS suggests modifying loci, most of which are unknown. In many human disorders, chaperones and the ubiquitin?proteasome system have been found to modify disease severity, thereby providing novel therapy targets. Here, we demonstrate upregulation of stress-induced Hsp70 and Hsp90 in two EBS models, namely, in neonatal K5?/? mice and upon proteasome inhibition in cells that stably express the disease-causing mutation K14?p.Arg125Cys, both harboring keratin aggregates. Furthermore, proteasome inhibition caused nuclear translocation of pHSF-1 and an increase in K14?p.Arg125Cys-positive aggregates in cells. Overexpression of the chaperone-associated ubiquitin ligase CHIP/STUB1 strongly reduced keratin aggregates through increased degradation of mutant K14. Using CHIP?p.Met1_Ala142del (?TPR?CHIP), we demonstrated the involvement of Hsc70 and Hsp70 in mutant keratin degradation. Our data uncover common principles between EBS and other protein misfolding disorders, revealing that aggregation-prone keratins are targeted by components of the chaperone machinery. Thus, modulation of the chaperone machinery using small molecules may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for dominant EBS, allowing reformation of an intact keratin cytoskeleton.

AB  - Epidermolysis bullosa (KB) refers to a group of hereditary mechano-bullous conditions, many of which arc associated with chronic scarring. Several forms of (he disease have been reported in association with cutaneous malignancy. We present a series of 10 EB patients (eight generalised recessive dystrophic EB, one dominant dystrophic EB, one non-lethal junctional EB) aged 24?25 years with a total of 29 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Three patients died from metastatic disease associated with invasive, poorly differentiated SCC. Six cases had multiple primary SCG, including three patients with simultaneous multifocal disease. Twenty-eight of the 29 SCC arose on the limbs. I Histology revealed that most of the SCC were well or moderately differentiated (22/29). Unusual histological findings included two verrucous SCC, as well as a spindle cell (angiosarcoma-like) SCC. Most of the SCC developed in areas of chronic non-healing ulceration (10/29) or longstanding hyperkeratotic crusting (14/29). The dermis around or beneath the carcinomas was densely scarred, more so than in non-malignant areas. In some cases it was difficult to distinguish the clinical appearances of certain areas of chronic ulceration, scarring, and crusting typical of dystrophic EB from many of the SCC. This study underlines the need for constant vigilance for the development of carcinomas in this group of patients, the occasional diagnostic difficulty, and the potential for metastasis.

AB  - Summary Evaluating the child with seizures is a complex process that often involves a variety of different care providers in several settings, including pediatricians, emergency room personnel, teachers, and parents along with the neurologist who may be ultimately responsible for the diagnosis and management of the patient. This chapter will attempt to discuss the tools and diagnostic tests involved in this process, and current practice parameters regarding emergent evaluation and initial assessment. We outline a strategy for evaluation of seizures that includes a discussion of accurate diagnosis, etiology, and assessment of recurrence risk in order to determine appropriate management and counseling. This covers history-taking, assessment of comorbidities, and physical examination. Additional neurodiagnostic assessments are also considered, including EEG, neuroimaging, and laboratory testing.
