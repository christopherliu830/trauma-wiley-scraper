AB  - Summary The paradigm of sepsis as an excessive inflammatory response to infection should now be extended to include activation and/or depression of numerous systems within the body. These include neural, immune, hormonal, bioenergetic and metabolic pathways. The levels of activity of these systems vary both with illness severity and over time. Perturbation of the components of each pathway is independently associated with a heightened mortality risk yet interactions and temporal relationships remain poorly understood. A better delineation of this intricate network and an enhanced ability to monitor these changes should lead to improved targeting of interventions and an avoidance of potentially harmful therapeutic strategies. In addition, greater recognition of the deleterious covert effects on these systems of many therapies currently established as standard management, for example inotropes, antibiotics and sedatives, should hopefully minimise the iatrogenic contribution to mortality and morbidity.

AB  - Summary In vivo and in vitro studies in the cellular and molecular signaling activations on adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have provided new insights into their potential clinical applications, particularly for tissue repair and regeneration. This review focuses on these advances, specifically in the context of characterizing MSCs and self-renewal for tissue repair and recovery after diseases. MSCs have been extensively characterized and demonstrated mitigation and therapy on different diseases in human clinical cases and experimental animal models. MSC-based technologies for treating diseases alone or in combination with adjuvants are foreseeable. Current challenges in MSC therapy are the need to overcome cell purity, bioengineering difficulties for tissue structures, optimization of MSC administration protocols, termination of MSC activation after repair and regeneration accomplished, and safety of long-term presence of MSCs in the body.

AB  - Abstract Sickle cell leg ulcers (SCLUs) are a common complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). Patients who develop ulcers appear to have a more severe haemolysis-associated vasculopathy than individuals who do not develop them, and manifest other complications such as priapism and pulmonary hypertension. SCLUs are slow to heal and often recur, affecting both the emotional and physical well-being of patients. Here we summarise what is known about the pathophysiology of SCLUs, describe available treatment options and propose a treatment algorithm.

AB  - Summary Dementia and cognitive impairment are very common and accompany many neurological as well as systemic diseases. This chapter first talks about delirium, dementia and cognitive impairment. Cognition, like other aspects of human brain function, has a modular organisation, and different cognitive functions have distinct anatomical substrates. The chapter then focuses on the differential diagnosis of delirium and dementia, and a structured approach to the investigation of cognitive impairment. Alzheimer's disease is the prototypical cortical dementia against which other dementias are compared in a differential diagnosis. The prion diseases are transmissible agents with unique composition and properties, being apparently devoid of significant nucleic acid. The greatest risk factor for development of dementia is age. However, there are several modifiable risk factors. Moderate exercise reduces the risk of dementia as does modification of vascular risk factors: obesity, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, hypertension and smoking.

AB  - Daily hemodialysis greatly improves clinical and biochemical parameters and patient quality of life compared to conventional thrice weekly dialysis. However, mortality statistics are lacking as most centers providing daily dialysis have treated only a small number of relatively selected patients for relatively short observation times. To study patient survival we pooled experience from three sources: 51 French and 128 U.S. patients selected for daily home hemodialysis and 42 U.S. patients selected for short daily center hemodialysis because of many medical complications and cardiovascular instability. Results were compared to age-matched patients from the USRDS 2003 data base. The age of the patients was 51?±?16 (18?89) years; 29% were female; they had 3.3?±?1.8 comorbidities (twice that of USRDS patients); 32% had diabetes or hypertension as cause of renal disease (USRDS patients 70%); blood access was 61% fistulae, 25% grafts, and 14% CV-catheters. Mean duration of ESRD treatment at start of short daily hemodialysis was 6?±?7 years. The observation period was 315 patient years. Patients had been on daily hemodialysis for a mean of 17?±?18 (0?92) months and 11 patients were observed for more than 5 years. 35 of the 221 patients died (16%); deaths were 111 per 1,000 patient years (53% of expected) and 5-year cumulative survival was 63% compared to 32% for USRDS patients. Five-year survival was 0% in patients with >3 comorbidities, 75% in patients with <3 comorbidities (p?<?0.0001), and in patients aged <53 years was 80% vs. 50% in patients aged >53 years (p?=?0.0007). On Cox stepwise hazards analysis, comorbidity alone predicted survival when used with age. Comorbidity >3 HR?=?6.00 (95% CI 2.2?16.3). Conclusions: It is difficult to do survival comparisons between patient groups. However, these daily dialysis patients were age-matched with patients from the USRDS database. There were fewer diabetic and hypertensive patients but the comorbidity index was twice that of USRDS patients. Survival, both deaths per 1,000 patient years and cumulative count was approximately twice that reported by the USRDS and strongly suggests superior survival with short daily hemodialysis compared to thrice weekly conventional dialysis.

AB  - Decrease of HCV viral load and HGF plasma levels increase have been related to HD sessions. Beneficial effects of HGF stimulation in HD on the outcome of HCV liver disease have been described. Aim was to analyze potential differences between intermittent (3???week) and short daily (6???week) HD, examining differences between HCV+ and ? pts. We studied 41?pts from 2 HD centres, 26 on intermittent HD (6 on line HF), 8 HCV+, and 15 on short-daily HD with 4 HCV+ 40?pts used synthetic HD membranes (low-flux and high-flux). Among HCV?+?we determined viral load by Amplicor (Roche) pre- and post- HD. All pts were studied for HGF levels (ELISA) baseline, 15?min, end, and at start of the following session viral load is significantly higher preHD and decreases over session. High-flux membranes were more efficient in reducing viremia (67% vs 45%), which level was higher pre- and post-HD principally in patients using low-flux membranes. Viremia in DHD is lower than in intermittent (470067.3?±?663974.5 vs 1015695.5?±?1202679.0). HCV+ HCV? p HGF baseline 3261.3?±?1904.5 2186.5?±?815.7 0.01 HGF 15?min 8000.0?±?0.0 7774.0?±?1129.8 ns HGF end 6142.5?±?2262.3 4443.7?±?2515.7 0.03 HGF start 3391.0?±?1680.6 2311.7?±?633.6 0.007 HGF at baseline, at the end of the session, and starting the following one was significantly higher in HCV?+?patients. Maximum increase appears always at 15?min. HGF levels were significantly higher in daily HD than intermittent. Of the 14 patients who showed HGF after session higher than 8000, 8 were HCV+(3 in DHD, 5 high flux), 6 were HCV?(5 DHD and 3 high flux), 14?pts finished HD session with HGF>8000, 8HCV+(3 DHD, 5 high flux) and 6HCV?(5 DHD, 4 high-flux). HGF stimulation appears in daily and intermittent HD, with higher level in the latter; HCV+ showed higher HGF vs negative, independently from the HD frequency; HCV viral load diminishes in all HD sessions, more in those with high-flux membranes. Short-daily HD with high-flux synthetic membranes seems the best option for HCV+ patients, and when performed in home precludes nosocomial transmission.

AB  - Purpose:? Contamination of catheter hub connectors is known to cause catheter-related blood stream infections in patients undergoing hemodialysis via central venous catheters (CVC). The effectiveness of cleansing the hub with an antimicrobial agent was assessed by culturing the surface of the hub following sanitation. Methods:?The CVC hub connectors of 24 patients were sanitized using the standard hospital protocol of aseptically swabbing the connectors with a solution of bleach or Betadine, and then bathing the hub in sterile gauze soaked with the antimicrobial solution for 5 minutes. The exterior surface of the hub was then cultured for a broad spectrum of microorganisms. Patients were monitored for exit site infection, tunnel infection, and septicemia. In the laboratory, sterile hubs were inoculated with E. coli, staph. aureus neg., and yeast. Hubs were then immersed in Betadine for 5, 10, or 30?min. and cultures were taken. Results:?Positive cultures were obtained from the hubs of 17 of the 24 patients. Seven (7) of the patients with positive results developed bacteremia from the cultured organism within 7 weeks. Positive cultures were obtained from 50% of inoculated lab samples after 5?min, 10% after 15?min, and 0% after 30?min. of immersion sanitation. Conclusions:?The techniques for cleansing CVC hubs should be revisited.
