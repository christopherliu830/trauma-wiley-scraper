AB  - Abstract Bottom-up tissue engineering is a promising approach for designing modular biomimetic structures that aim to recapitulate the intricate hierarchy and biofunctionality of native human tissues. In recent years, this field has seen exciting progress driven by an increasing knowledge of biological systems and their rational deconstruction into key core components. Relevant advances in the bottom-up assembly of unitary living blocks toward the creation of higher order bioarchitectures based on multicellular-rich structures or multicomponent cell?biomaterial synergies are described. An up-to-date critical overview of long-term existing and rapidly emerging technologies for integrative bottom-up tissue engineering is provided, including discussion of their practical challenges and required advances. It is envisioned that a combination of cell?biomaterial constructs with bioadaptable features and biospecific 3D designs will contribute to the development of more robust and functional humanized tissues for therapies and disease models, as well as tools for fundamental biological studies.

AB  - Summary Ferrets are commonly used as an animal model for influenza virus research, as well as other disease conditions, such as Helicobacter-induced gastropathy. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a distinct idiopathic inflammatory condition of young adult ferrets. Affected animals may present with vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy, and a marked eosinophilia may be noted during routine hematologic evaluation. Hematologic changes may include nonregenerative anemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and thrombocytopenia. Differential diagnoses for hypergammaglobulinemia and/or abdominal masses include Aleutian disease, lymphosarcoma, chronic infection (e.g., proliferative colitis, helicobacteriosis), idiopathic splenomegaly, multiple myeloma, other neoplasms, and inflammatory bowel disease. Hepatic coccidiosis and toxoplasmosis are seen sporadically in ferrets. Similarly, systemic viral disease caused by infection with canine distemper virus, influenza virus, Aleutian disease (a parvovirus infection), and coronavirus may induce foci of hepatic necrosis and inflammation. Nonspecific lymphoplasmacytic hepatitis may be seen with moderate regularity in surgical biopsies or tissue sections from adult ferrets as an extension of gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions.

AB  - Abstract In the United States, over 51,000 new cases of urinary bladder tumors are diagnosed annually, Approximately 75?85% of all newly diagnosed cases are superficial transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs). Incidence is highest (80% of the cases) in the 50?79 year age group. Recent studies have reported that 21?25% of risk for bladder cancer among United States white males is due to occupational exposure. The DuPont Chambers Works in Deepwater, New Jersey, was a major producer of two chemicals now known to be human bladder carcinogens (?-naphthylamine and benzidine) as well as two suspected human bladder carcinogens [ortho-toluidine and 4,4?-methylene-bis,2-chloroaniline (MOCA?)]. Between 1954 and 1982, DuPont screened 1723 exposed employees annually at the Chambers Works using the Papanicolaou test for urinary cytology and mocroscopic urinalysis. A review of the prior screening program found that employees who developed bladder cancer during this time period were approximatly twice as likely to have had hematuria than those comparably exposed who did not deveolop bladder cancer. Building on this finding, a three-year screening study evaluated a home self-test for mocroscopic hematuria to aid early detection of treatable urologic conditons among exposed workers at this chemical plant. Every six months, subjects tested their urine at home for 14 consecutive days, for the presence blood. A high degree of adherence to our protocol (over 92% completed and returned the self-testing record) as well as high compliance with repeat screening (85% returned for screening jin subsequent quaerterws) demonstrated good aceptance and performance of the recommended schedule of self-testing. Through the first 7 periods of screening, two new cases and one recurrence of TCC of the bladder were detected. ? 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Introduction:? Hemoperfusion, with or without hemodialysis, has been used to treat patients suffering from severe valproic acid poisoning. We report a patient suffering from severe valproic acid intoxication who was treated effectively with high-flux hemodialysis alone. Case:?A 20-year-old man with a history of bipolar disorder was admitted after having ingested unknown amounts of valproic acid (Depakote?), prednisone, and erythromycin. He was agitated and obtunded but hemodynamically stable initially. Serum valproic acid level was 1,028??g/mL. Urine toxicology screen as well as serum levels of ethanol, acetaminophen, and acetylsalicylic acid levels were negative. A gastric lavage was followed by activated charcoal instillation. Subsequent myoclonic twitchings that progressed to continuous seizure activity were managed with intravenous lorazepam therapy and endotracheal intubation. Serum valproic acid value measured two hours after admission remained elevated at 1,046??g/mL. Hemodialysis was performed continuously for 10.5 hours using a high-flux, polysulfone dialyzer (Polyflux 21S, Fresenius Medical Care, Lexington, MA), a dialyzer blood flow of 200?300?mL/min, and a dialysate flow of 500?mL/min. The therapy brought about a fall in serum valproic acid level to 110??g/mL and a complete recovery of the patient. Discussion:?Valproic acid (144 Dalton) is 90?95% protein-bound at therapeutic serum values. However, in the face of an overdose, the unbound fraction rises because of saturation of protein-binding sites. This unbound fraction is readily dialyzable. We suggest that high-flux hemodialysis is effective in the treatment of severe valproic acid poisoning.

AB  - One of the basic symptoms of a terminal stage chronic renal insufficiency is anemia. From everything, used methods of correction of an anemia, it is considered the most effective application of preparations recombinant human erythropoietin (r-Hu EPO). Since 1994 in the Scientific Centre of Surgery begins application r-Hu EPO. Application r-Hu EPO in patients with a terminal stage chronic renal insufficiency in 90?95% of cases had a positive effect, but 5?10% of patients have intolerance to erythropoietin, that has induced to search of new effective methods of correction of anemia. During research were determined quantity erythrocytes, hemoglobin, reticulocyte in peripheral blood and acid-alkaline condition of blood. All hematology parameters were defined at the beginning of treatment, over 5 day and for 15 day of stimulation of a bone marrow. For 15 days after stimulation of a bone marrow by the laser there was an authentic increase of quantity erythrocyte, hemoglobin, hematocrit. The initial contents erythrocytes made 2.22?±?0.1 10???12, hemoglobin 67.7?±?3.2?g/l and hematocrit 18.2?±?1.2%. During treatment by the laser parameters erythrocytes have increased up to 2.9?±?0.8 10???12, hemoglobin up to 89.6?±?2.9?g/l and hematocrit up to 28.2?±?1.3%(P?<?0,005). Hematology parameters in blood of control group authentically have not changed.

AB  - Tunneled-cuffed hemodialysis catheters are frequently used as long-term vascular access in children due to the technical difficulties in constructing a fistula. Catheter-related bacteremia (CRB) is still a major complication contributing to patient morbidity and loss of vascular access. Objective:?To investigate the microbiological characteristics of CRB in children on hemodialysis. Methods:?Chart review of 63 children who received hemodialysis with a tunneled-cuffed catheter between January 1999 and December 2003 was performed. CRB was diagnosed when positive blood cultures were obtained in patients with symptoms of bacteremia, and without an identifiable source. Results:?During the 5 year period, a total of 251 CRB were detected with 313 bacterial and 2 candidal growths in the blood cultures. The distribution of gram positive (Gr+) and gram negative (Gr?) microorganisms and their sensitivity patterns are shown in the table. Coagulase negative Staphylococcus was the most common microorganism, and constituted 62% of all bacterial isolates. All Gr+ microorganisms were sensitive to vancomycin except one isolate of Enterococcus fecalis. Enterobacter cloacae was the most common Gr? microorganism, followed by Klebsiella pneumonia. The sensitivity of Gr? microorganisms to levofloxacin was 100%. The treatment course was complicated by the growth of a second microorganism in subsequent blood cultures in 24% of infections; 54% of these consisted of both Gr+ and Gr? isolates. The etiology of ESRD or the use of immunosuppressive agents had no effect on the occurrence of CRB. The average number of infections were 5.8/1000 catheter days, and the recurrence of CRB was more likely in patients who had two or more CRB in a year. 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Gr+ growth 80% 88% 87% 85% 73% Oxacillin resistance 84% 73% 82% 68% 75% Gr? growth 20% 12% 13% 15% 27% Tobramycin resistance 21% 50% 25% 20% 13% Conclusions: Empiric initial treatment for CRB should include both Gr+, and Gr? coverage. Oxacillin and first generation cephalosporins are not good choices due to high incidence of resistance. Levofloxacin is a good alternative for Gr CRB. Novel preventive measures should be sought in patients who have a tendency to have recurrent CRB.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate and describe biochemical indices of bone metabolism in 4 children on NHD. Method:The children, aged 12, 13, 14, and 16?yrs, have been treated exclusively on NHD for 6, 9, 9, and 15?mos. Subsequently, Pt 1 converted to a hybrid program of 4 nights on home nocturnal plus 1 session of in center conventional HD per week. Biochemical indices of bone metabolism have been collected prospectively. Results:All baseline pre-dialysis calcium levels were within normal ranges and each patient was started on a dialysis calcium concentration of 3.0?mEq/L. However, over time the number of asymptomatic biochemical hypocalcaemic episodes increased. The dialysate calcium concentration was increased to 3.5?mEq/L in one and decreased to 2.0?mEq/L in another who was hypercalcemic and receiving concurrent calcitonin for bone pain related to osteoporosis. In Pt 1, the dialysate calcium was increased to 3.5?mEq/L during nocturnal and continued on hybrid therapy. Including an evaluation of dietary intake, all 4 patients had a net positive calcium balance, ranging between 9.8 to 23.5?mmol (393?942?mg). A significant reduction in the predialysis phosphate level was observed in all 4 patients, and none required dietary restrictions or the use of phosphate binders within 2 months or vitamin D within 6 months of HND. In addition, phosphate was added to provide a dialysate concentration of 2.4?6.1?mEq/L to prevent hypophosphatemia. This is reflected by significant reductions in intact PTH levels to the desired range (twice the normal range) in all 4, but the level continued to drop to the normal range and below in 2. In Pt 1, after introduction of hybrid therapy, both levels of phosphate and PTH rose, necessitating recommencement of phosphate binders and vitamin D. Likewise, the (Ca???PO4) dropped and remained <55 in all 4 patients exclusively on NHD, but started to climb in Pt 1 during hybrid therapy. Conclusion:In our cohort of patients, NHD rapidly lowered plasma phosphate and PTH levels. With NHD, additional dialysate phosphate and possibly calcium may be necessary to prevent chronic losses and development of renal osteodystrophy, and caution is required to prevent either oversuppression of PTH and extraskeletal calcification.

AB  - Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis and vasculopathy of the skin and visceral organs. Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), the most acute and life threatening complication, occurs in 10?20% of adult patients with SSc and has not been reported in children. A 10-year-old girl was diagnosed with SSc when she presented with weakness and skin thickening. She had positive ANA and anti-Scl 70. Renal function, urinalysis, and blood pressure were normal. She was treated with steroids, penicillamin and methotrexate as well as amlodipine for Raynaud's phenomenon, but her diffuse skin thickening and contractures progressed and she became wheelchair bound and had poor growth despite nutrition through a G-tube. At age 15 (weight 28?kg), when evaluated for abdominal pain, she was found to have acute renal failure (BUN 54?mg/dl, creatinine 2.2?mg/dl) and hypertension. Despite therapy with enalapril, serum creatinine continued to rise and she became oligoanuric, requiring initiation of hemodialysis. BP was controlled with enalapril and dialysis but she remained dialysis dependent. Steroid therapy was discontinued and replaced by low dose cyclosporine. Enalapril was replaced by losartan because of leukopenia and BP remained normal. Over the next 2 years, she was treated with hemodialysis and did not experience any complications. She progressively had an outstanding overall clinical improvement, marked skin softening, and was able to walk independently. Renal function did not improve. 28 months after the SRC, she received LRD renal transplant. Immunosuppression included cyclosporine, mycophenolate and prednisone. Creatinine 2 months post-transplant is 0.7?mg/dl. SRC in children may progress to end-stage renal disease but can be treated successfully with dialysis and transplantation without significant complications.

AB  - Purpose:? Tunneled catheters as chronic dialysis access is a reality of chronic hemodialysis. Infection of the catheter is an unavoidable complication. We researched the possibility of using Na Citrate as capping because of its anticoagulant effects and bactericidal properties. Methods:?Rate of infections per 1000 calendar days with heparin capping was recorded for an eight month period before using Na Citrate. Flows <300?ml/min via catheters were also recorded for an eight month period before Na Citrate use, using treatments per 1000 calendar days. Both these parameters were recorded for an eight month period following the initiation of Na Citrate 4% for all catheters. Results:?Our infection rate using heparin was 2.2 infections per 1000 catheter days. Infection rate after use of Na citrate was 1.2 infections per 1000 calendar days. Catheter flows <300 were 5.6 per 1000 calendar days using heparin, and 9.2 per 1000 calendar days after use of Na Citrate. There were no reactions related to Na Citrate, and no symptomatic hypocalcemia. Conclusions:?Na Citrate is effective at reducing the number of infections when used as a capping solution for tunneled catheters. Na Citrate?capped catheters had more frequent declines in QB compared with heparin capping. Because of the availability of anti-thrombolytic agents to preserve catheter patency, Na Citrate makes a safe option as a capping agent for long-term catheter capping.

AB  - Summary In vivo and in vitro studies in the cellular and molecular signaling activations on adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have provided new insights into their potential clinical applications, particularly for tissue repair and regeneration. This review focuses on these advances, specifically in the context of characterizing MSCs and self-renewal for tissue repair and recovery after diseases. MSCs have been extensively characterized and demonstrated mitigation and therapy on different diseases in human clinical cases and experimental animal models. MSC-based technologies for treating diseases alone or in combination with adjuvants are foreseeable. Current challenges in MSC therapy are the need to overcome cell purity, bioengineering difficulties for tissue structures, optimization of MSC administration protocols, termination of MSC activation after repair and regeneration accomplished, and safety of long-term presence of MSCs in the body.

AB  - Objective:? Pleural involvement of salmonella infection is very rare and we are not aware of any case of salmonella empyema in hemodialysis patients. The purpose of this study is to report our experience of recurrent empyema due to Salmonella enteritidis with bacteremia in a patient on hemodialysis. Case report: A 53-year-old woman with end stage renal disease, having been on hemodialysis for 10 days, was brought to the emergency department due to fever and shortness of breath for 2 days. Her initial physical examination revealed diminished breathing sound over right lung field. The chest radiographs disclosed right pleural effusion and pleural fluid analysis included a white cell count of 13800(N/L:95/5), LDH 2534?U/L, protein 2.7?g/dL, and sugar 10?mg/dL. Right side empyema was noted. Sonography revealed splenomegaly. Salmonella enteritidis was identified from the cultures of blood and pleural fluid. After antimicrobial therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone for 2 weeks and pleural pigtail drainage, fever subsided and pleural drainage tube was removed. However, thoracoscopic debridement was done later because of recurrent empyema within one week after removing the drainage tube. Computed tomography revealed pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and splenomegaly, but there was no evidence of aortic aneurysm formation or infectious process of aorta. Overall the patient received 6 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone treatment and 3 months of oral ciprofloxacin. The follow-up CXR revealed minimal pleural effusion. Conclusion:? Nontyphoidal salmonella infection can present with empyema and bacteremia in patients on hemodialysis. Adequate drainage and antimicrobial therapy may be necessary to treat such patients effectively.

AB  - The number of patients treated for end-stage renal disease increases in Sweden like the rest of the world. During the last six years more than 1000 persons a year started renal replacement therapy. Today hemodialysis patients have the opportunity to choose different treatment modalities?home hemodialysis, self-care dialysis, or conventional dialysis. Purpose:?The aim of the study was to investigate differences in patient on home hemodialysis, self-care dialysis, and conventional dialysis regarding quality of life, self-care, and sense of coherence. Methods:?Questionnaires were used: Short Form (SF-36), Appraisal of Self-Care Agency (ASA-scale), and Sense of Coherence scale (SOC). 19 patients were included in the study (five patients on home hemodialysis, six self-care patients, and eight patients on conventional dialysis). Results:?The results showed a tendency of higher scores in quality of life, self-care, and sense of coherence for the home hemodialysis patients. Conclusion:?Since the number of participants in this study was low, it is necessary to include more patients in a future study in order to verify the results.
