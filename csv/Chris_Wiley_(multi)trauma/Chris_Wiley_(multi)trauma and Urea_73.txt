AB  - Abstract Objective To describe the anesthetic management of a dog undergoing caudal vena cava (CVC) occlusion during adrenalectomy, and to discuss a reflex bradycardia that was observed during the procedure. Case Summary General anesthesia of a 10-year-old Rhodesian ridgeback for excision of an adrenal mass and associated CVC tumor thrombus was performed. The dog was premedicated with IV methadone and anesthesia was induced with IV alfaxalone and maintained with isoflurane in 100% oxygen. An IV remifentanil infusion was administered for intraoperative analgesia. Surgical removal of the thrombus necessitated temporary complete occlusion of the CVC. During CVC occlusion an acute paradoxical bradycardia occurred, which was successfully treated with IV atropine. The cardiovascular change resembled a Bezold?Jarisch or reverse Bainbridge reflex, and was believed to be mediated by cardiac mechanoreceptors following the sudden decrease in preload. Increased myocardial contractility subsequent to increased sympathetic nervous system activity may also have contributed. A decrease in urine output was observed following CVC occlusion but had returned to normal 2 hours following the end of anesthesia. Recovery from anesthesia was otherwise uneventful. New or unique information provided Although the mechanism is unclear, a paradoxical bradycardia may occur during complete CVC occlusion in the dog. Factors that increase sympathetic nervous system outflow, such as administration of dopamine, may have contributed to the occurrence of the reflex.

AB  - Abstract Bottom-up tissue engineering is a promising approach for designing modular biomimetic structures that aim to recapitulate the intricate hierarchy and biofunctionality of native human tissues. In recent years, this field has seen exciting progress driven by an increasing knowledge of biological systems and their rational deconstruction into key core components. Relevant advances in the bottom-up assembly of unitary living blocks toward the creation of higher order bioarchitectures based on multicellular-rich structures or multicomponent cell?biomaterial synergies are described. An up-to-date critical overview of long-term existing and rapidly emerging technologies for integrative bottom-up tissue engineering is provided, including discussion of their practical challenges and required advances. It is envisioned that a combination of cell?biomaterial constructs with bioadaptable features and biospecific 3D designs will contribute to the development of more robust and functional humanized tissues for therapies and disease models, as well as tools for fundamental biological studies.

AB  - Abstract In the United States, over 51,000 new cases of urinary bladder tumors are diagnosed annually, Approximately 75?85% of all newly diagnosed cases are superficial transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs). Incidence is highest (80% of the cases) in the 50?79 year age group. Recent studies have reported that 21?25% of risk for bladder cancer among United States white males is due to occupational exposure. The DuPont Chambers Works in Deepwater, New Jersey, was a major producer of two chemicals now known to be human bladder carcinogens (?-naphthylamine and benzidine) as well as two suspected human bladder carcinogens [ortho-toluidine and 4,4?-methylene-bis,2-chloroaniline (MOCA?)]. Between 1954 and 1982, DuPont screened 1723 exposed employees annually at the Chambers Works using the Papanicolaou test for urinary cytology and mocroscopic urinalysis. A review of the prior screening program found that employees who developed bladder cancer during this time period were approximatly twice as likely to have had hematuria than those comparably exposed who did not deveolop bladder cancer. Building on this finding, a three-year screening study evaluated a home self-test for mocroscopic hematuria to aid early detection of treatable urologic conditons among exposed workers at this chemical plant. Every six months, subjects tested their urine at home for 14 consecutive days, for the presence blood. A high degree of adherence to our protocol (over 92% completed and returned the self-testing record) as well as high compliance with repeat screening (85% returned for screening jin subsequent quaerterws) demonstrated good aceptance and performance of the recommended schedule of self-testing. Through the first 7 periods of screening, two new cases and one recurrence of TCC of the bladder were detected. ? 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Introduction:? Hemoperfusion, with or without hemodialysis, has been used to treat patients suffering from severe valproic acid poisoning. We report a patient suffering from severe valproic acid intoxication who was treated effectively with high-flux hemodialysis alone. Case:?A 20-year-old man with a history of bipolar disorder was admitted after having ingested unknown amounts of valproic acid (Depakote?), prednisone, and erythromycin. He was agitated and obtunded but hemodynamically stable initially. Serum valproic acid level was 1,028??g/mL. Urine toxicology screen as well as serum levels of ethanol, acetaminophen, and acetylsalicylic acid levels were negative. A gastric lavage was followed by activated charcoal instillation. Subsequent myoclonic twitchings that progressed to continuous seizure activity were managed with intravenous lorazepam therapy and endotracheal intubation. Serum valproic acid value measured two hours after admission remained elevated at 1,046??g/mL. Hemodialysis was performed continuously for 10.5 hours using a high-flux, polysulfone dialyzer (Polyflux 21S, Fresenius Medical Care, Lexington, MA), a dialyzer blood flow of 200?300?mL/min, and a dialysate flow of 500?mL/min. The therapy brought about a fall in serum valproic acid level to 110??g/mL and a complete recovery of the patient. Discussion:?Valproic acid (144 Dalton) is 90?95% protein-bound at therapeutic serum values. However, in the face of an overdose, the unbound fraction rises because of saturation of protein-binding sites. This unbound fraction is readily dialyzable. We suggest that high-flux hemodialysis is effective in the treatment of severe valproic acid poisoning.

AB  - One of the basic symptoms of a terminal stage chronic renal insufficiency is anemia. From everything, used methods of correction of an anemia, it is considered the most effective application of preparations recombinant human erythropoietin (r-Hu EPO). Since 1994 in the Scientific Centre of Surgery begins application r-Hu EPO. Application r-Hu EPO in patients with a terminal stage chronic renal insufficiency in 90?95% of cases had a positive effect, but 5?10% of patients have intolerance to erythropoietin, that has induced to search of new effective methods of correction of anemia. During research were determined quantity erythrocytes, hemoglobin, reticulocyte in peripheral blood and acid-alkaline condition of blood. All hematology parameters were defined at the beginning of treatment, over 5 day and for 15 day of stimulation of a bone marrow. For 15 days after stimulation of a bone marrow by the laser there was an authentic increase of quantity erythrocyte, hemoglobin, hematocrit. The initial contents erythrocytes made 2.22?±?0.1 10???12, hemoglobin 67.7?±?3.2?g/l and hematocrit 18.2?±?1.2%. During treatment by the laser parameters erythrocytes have increased up to 2.9?±?0.8 10???12, hemoglobin up to 89.6?±?2.9?g/l and hematocrit up to 28.2?±?1.3%(P?<?0,005). Hematology parameters in blood of control group authentically have not changed.

AB  - Tunneled-cuffed hemodialysis catheters are frequently used as long-term vascular access in children due to the technical difficulties in constructing a fistula. Catheter-related bacteremia (CRB) is still a major complication contributing to patient morbidity and loss of vascular access. Objective:?To investigate the microbiological characteristics of CRB in children on hemodialysis. Methods:?Chart review of 63 children who received hemodialysis with a tunneled-cuffed catheter between January 1999 and December 2003 was performed. CRB was diagnosed when positive blood cultures were obtained in patients with symptoms of bacteremia, and without an identifiable source. Results:?During the 5 year period, a total of 251 CRB were detected with 313 bacterial and 2 candidal growths in the blood cultures. The distribution of gram positive (Gr+) and gram negative (Gr?) microorganisms and their sensitivity patterns are shown in the table. Coagulase negative Staphylococcus was the most common microorganism, and constituted 62% of all bacterial isolates. All Gr+ microorganisms were sensitive to vancomycin except one isolate of Enterococcus fecalis. Enterobacter cloacae was the most common Gr? microorganism, followed by Klebsiella pneumonia. The sensitivity of Gr? microorganisms to levofloxacin was 100%. The treatment course was complicated by the growth of a second microorganism in subsequent blood cultures in 24% of infections; 54% of these consisted of both Gr+ and Gr? isolates. The etiology of ESRD or the use of immunosuppressive agents had no effect on the occurrence of CRB. The average number of infections were 5.8/1000 catheter days, and the recurrence of CRB was more likely in patients who had two or more CRB in a year. 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Gr+ growth 80% 88% 87% 85% 73% Oxacillin resistance 84% 73% 82% 68% 75% Gr? growth 20% 12% 13% 15% 27% Tobramycin resistance 21% 50% 25% 20% 13% Conclusions: Empiric initial treatment for CRB should include both Gr+, and Gr? coverage. Oxacillin and first generation cephalosporins are not good choices due to high incidence of resistance. Levofloxacin is a good alternative for Gr CRB. Novel preventive measures should be sought in patients who have a tendency to have recurrent CRB.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate and describe biochemical indices of bone metabolism in 4 children on NHD. Method:The children, aged 12, 13, 14, and 16?yrs, have been treated exclusively on NHD for 6, 9, 9, and 15?mos. Subsequently, Pt 1 converted to a hybrid program of 4 nights on home nocturnal plus 1 session of in center conventional HD per week. Biochemical indices of bone metabolism have been collected prospectively. Results:All baseline pre-dialysis calcium levels were within normal ranges and each patient was started on a dialysis calcium concentration of 3.0?mEq/L. However, over time the number of asymptomatic biochemical hypocalcaemic episodes increased. The dialysate calcium concentration was increased to 3.5?mEq/L in one and decreased to 2.0?mEq/L in another who was hypercalcemic and receiving concurrent calcitonin for bone pain related to osteoporosis. In Pt 1, the dialysate calcium was increased to 3.5?mEq/L during nocturnal and continued on hybrid therapy. Including an evaluation of dietary intake, all 4 patients had a net positive calcium balance, ranging between 9.8 to 23.5?mmol (393?942?mg). A significant reduction in the predialysis phosphate level was observed in all 4 patients, and none required dietary restrictions or the use of phosphate binders within 2 months or vitamin D within 6 months of HND. In addition, phosphate was added to provide a dialysate concentration of 2.4?6.1?mEq/L to prevent hypophosphatemia. This is reflected by significant reductions in intact PTH levels to the desired range (twice the normal range) in all 4, but the level continued to drop to the normal range and below in 2. In Pt 1, after introduction of hybrid therapy, both levels of phosphate and PTH rose, necessitating recommencement of phosphate binders and vitamin D. Likewise, the (Ca???PO4) dropped and remained <55 in all 4 patients exclusively on NHD, but started to climb in Pt 1 during hybrid therapy. Conclusion:In our cohort of patients, NHD rapidly lowered plasma phosphate and PTH levels. With NHD, additional dialysate phosphate and possibly calcium may be necessary to prevent chronic losses and development of renal osteodystrophy, and caution is required to prevent either oversuppression of PTH and extraskeletal calcification.

AB  - Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis and vasculopathy of the skin and visceral organs. Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), the most acute and life threatening complication, occurs in 10?20% of adult patients with SSc and has not been reported in children. A 10-year-old girl was diagnosed with SSc when she presented with weakness and skin thickening. She had positive ANA and anti-Scl 70. Renal function, urinalysis, and blood pressure were normal. She was treated with steroids, penicillamin and methotrexate as well as amlodipine for Raynaud's phenomenon, but her diffuse skin thickening and contractures progressed and she became wheelchair bound and had poor growth despite nutrition through a G-tube. At age 15 (weight 28?kg), when evaluated for abdominal pain, she was found to have acute renal failure (BUN 54?mg/dl, creatinine 2.2?mg/dl) and hypertension. Despite therapy with enalapril, serum creatinine continued to rise and she became oligoanuric, requiring initiation of hemodialysis. BP was controlled with enalapril and dialysis but she remained dialysis dependent. Steroid therapy was discontinued and replaced by low dose cyclosporine. Enalapril was replaced by losartan because of leukopenia and BP remained normal. Over the next 2 years, she was treated with hemodialysis and did not experience any complications. She progressively had an outstanding overall clinical improvement, marked skin softening, and was able to walk independently. Renal function did not improve. 28 months after the SRC, she received LRD renal transplant. Immunosuppression included cyclosporine, mycophenolate and prednisone. Creatinine 2 months post-transplant is 0.7?mg/dl. SRC in children may progress to end-stage renal disease but can be treated successfully with dialysis and transplantation without significant complications.

AB  - Purpose:? Tunneled catheters as chronic dialysis access is a reality of chronic hemodialysis. Infection of the catheter is an unavoidable complication. We researched the possibility of using Na Citrate as capping because of its anticoagulant effects and bactericidal properties. Methods:?Rate of infections per 1000 calendar days with heparin capping was recorded for an eight month period before using Na Citrate. Flows <300?ml/min via catheters were also recorded for an eight month period before Na Citrate use, using treatments per 1000 calendar days. Both these parameters were recorded for an eight month period following the initiation of Na Citrate 4% for all catheters. Results:?Our infection rate using heparin was 2.2 infections per 1000 catheter days. Infection rate after use of Na citrate was 1.2 infections per 1000 calendar days. Catheter flows <300 were 5.6 per 1000 calendar days using heparin, and 9.2 per 1000 calendar days after use of Na Citrate. There were no reactions related to Na Citrate, and no symptomatic hypocalcemia. Conclusions:?Na Citrate is effective at reducing the number of infections when used as a capping solution for tunneled catheters. Na Citrate?capped catheters had more frequent declines in QB compared with heparin capping. Because of the availability of anti-thrombolytic agents to preserve catheter patency, Na Citrate makes a safe option as a capping agent for long-term catheter capping.

AB  - To overcome problems of insufficient clearance, multiple dialyzers may be placed in series or in parallel. The present study aimed to investigate in vitro the overall clearance of small molecules in different dialyzer configurations in which mutual flow directions were changed. Single pass tests were performed with low flux Fresenius F6HPS dialyzers placed in series (12 tests), in parallel (6) and in single use (2). As blood substitute, either high concentrated (45?mS) bicarbonate dialysate (AB solution ? MW20-180) or a trisodiumphosphate (Na3PO4? MW395) concentration (30?mS) was used. Standard blood and dialysate flows of 250 and 500?mL/min, respectively, were applied. Furthermore, clearance was derived from conductivity measurements in the inlet and outlet bloodline, correcting for the overall ultrafiltration rate of 0.5?L/h (AB) and 0.1?L/h (Na3PO4). Compared to the standard setup using a single dialyzer with counter current flows, clearance increases by 3 to 8%(AB) and by 15 to 18%(Na3PO4) using two dialyzers in parallel and in series, respectively. With co-current flows in a serial dialyzer set up, clearance increases by 16%(AB) and 22%(Na3PO4) compared to the single dialyzer use. Changing subsequently the counter current flows to co-current in one and both dialyzers in series, the overall clearance decreases by 2 to 9%, respectively, for the AB solution, and by 8 to 15% for the Na3PO4 concentration. With respect to the parallel dialyzer setup, a split dialysate flow (250?mL/min in each dialyzer) counter current to the blood flow, increases the clearance by 4 and 12%, respectively. In conclusion, overall clearance is most ameliorated using two dialyzers in series with counter current flows.

AB  - The incidence of active tuberculosis among patients on long- term dialysis is higher than the rate in the general population. Case:?39-year-old male patient with ESRD was admitted to hospital with dyspnea, weight loss, cough without sputum and hemoptysis, and a palpable painless mass under the right areola. He was on maintenance hemodialysis three times a week for the last six months. PPD was negative. Chest X-ray examination revealed a hyperdense lesion. On the computerized tomography a cystic mass at the inferior lobe superior segment near the thorasic vertebra was detected. Fine needle aspiration from each of the mass lesions revealed granulomas and acido-resistant bacteria. Anti-tuberculous therapy was initiated. After eight months he came back with paraplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the lesion which previously has been described by CT was extending to the spinal duct and pressing on the spinal cord. After a biopsy, granuloma was seen; however, mycobacterium tuberculosis did not grow in the culture. Discussion:?Extrapulmonary tuberculosis is common in patients with ESRD. In the present case we established that the patient who presented a mass on the chest wall without pulmonary tuberculosis findings had indeed a tuberculous cavity mass. It is interesting to note that in this case this mass had no relationship to the tuberculous cavity in the lung tissue. Moreover, it is also interesting that paraspinal lesion occured during the period in which the patient was under treatment and it quickly progressed and led to paraplegia. Tissue biopsy with invasive procedures may be necessary. Thus, in areas with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, renal patients in high-risk group (renal transplant recipients, hemodialysis and CAPD patients) should be examined periodically to exclude silent infection and reduce morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Introduction:? The aim of renal replacement therapy (RRT) is to achieve a reduction in morbid events and improve quality of life (QOL). Mortality means the condition of being subject to death. Morbidity is anything that is abnormal, atypical, exceptional, and/or aberrant. Morbidity usually occurs as a result of a treatment (side effects), when treatment is inappropriate or inadequate. Predictors that may be risk factors for mortality and morbidity in dialysis patients can be divided into patient-related and treatment-related categories (Khan, 2000:11). Purpose of the study:?The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the morbidity and mortality profile of patients receiving RRT in the private sector. Research design and method:?This study was contextual and descriptive in nature, based on case analysis of patients receiving RRT in private dialysis facilities. A checklist was used that made provisions to record all patient- and treatment- related factors that might influence mortality and morbidity profiles of the target population. The target population included all hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients receiving treatment in private dialysis facilities of a specific company. Results:?The results indicated the following factors have an influence on patient morbidity and mortality: ?? Patient related: Age, comorbid situations such as peripheral vascular, cerebrovascular, and cardiovascular disease and also diabetes mellitus. ?? Treatment related: Referral pattern, nutritional status, dialysis adequacy, anaemia, and blood pressure.
