AB  - Poor patient compliance is common during dialysis therapy. We aimed to study incidence of noncompliance, contributing factors, and effects on quality of life (QOL) among cadaveric renal transplantation waiting list patients. We included 86 renal transplantation waiting list patients (56M/30F). Dialysis duration, previous renal transplantation history, comorbid conditions, interdialytic weight gain, predialysis BUN, creatinine, potassium, and phosphate were recorded. Noncompliance criteria were skipping >1 dialysis session or shortening a dialysis session>10?min in 1 month, interdialytic weight gain>5.7% of body weight, predialysis serum potassium >6?mEq/L, and phosphate level >7.5?mg/dl. There were 49 noncompliant (age: 46.8?±?21.8 years, HD duration: 83.9?±?48.7 months) and 37 compliant (age: 42.8?±?12.1 years, HD duration: 96.5?±?45.2 months) patients. QOL was evaluated by short form 36 and depression levels by Beck Depression Inventory. Previous renal transplantation was present in 24.4% and comorbid diseases in 31.3% of all patients. In depressed patients, 77.8% had comorbid diseases. No difference was found between the groups considering age, gender, dialysis duration, previous transplantation history, and comorbid diseases (p?>?0.05). Noncompliant patients had lower QOL (p?<?0.04). Noncompliant patients had higher degree of depression (p?=?0.01). QOL and Beck scores were negatively correlated (p?=?0.001, r?=??0.561). Noncompliance to diet and dialysis therapy is associated with depression, which further decreases QOL in renal transplantation waiting list patients. Early diagnosis of depression, is possible by monitoring noncompliance, and therapeutic intervention may benefit during the transplantation-waiting period.

AB  - Background:? Long slow hemodialysis (LS-HD) improves many biochemical parameters compared with conventional HD. However, its influences on quality of life are less well known. Aims:?The objective of this study was to examine the quality of life of patients on LS-HD performed overnight compared to the patients on standard hemodialysis. This extends the previous study, conducted in 2001, which examined the LS-HD patients, quality of life. Patients and methods:?We sent questionnaires to 12 LS-HD (overnight, treatment time 8?h???3/wk) patients and 15 day HD (4.5?h???3/wk) patients, all being treated using the limited care method. Data was collected using two different structured questionnaires. One was constructed for a previous study (2001) and the other one was a standardized set of questionnaires (RAND-36). Research material was collected from patient documents, such as the essential biochemical parameters, blood pressure, weight gain, and weekly EPO doses were recorded. Ten of the LS-HD patients (83%) and 13/15 (87%) of day HD patients returned the questionnaires. Three day hemodialysis patients returned empty questionnaires, which were disqualified. Results:?Based on the medical facts, the results showed that the patients of LS-HD felt better than the patients in another group. Patients on the LS-HD had higher Kt/V (2.623 vs. 1.577) and Hb (118 vs. 111) and lower Pi (1.36 vs. 1.63) and EPO dose (epoietin-beta 2667?ky/week vs. 5833?ky/week; darbepoetin 16?ky/week vs. 37?ky/week). However, their predialysis BP as well as the weight gain between treatments and salt and fluid balances caused problems furthermore. The experiences of the therapy of the LS-HD patients were more positive than of the control group: they felt their medical condition was better than of the patients on day HD. However we didn?t observe significant differences in the replies showing physical or psychosocial conditions between the two groups. Conclusions:?The study suggests that when patients can themselves make the choice between treatment modalities, it improves the quality of life of the patients. Control of anemia is improved in LS-HD overnight patients with lower doses of EPO. The LS-HD gives the patients more freedom of diet. However, more attention must be paid to salt and fluid restriction. The LS-HD makes it possible for many patients to work normally.

AB  - Purpose:? Identify practices to reduce HD catheter access related bacteremias (ARB). Methods:?Data was collected per the CDC Dialysis Surveillance Network protocol. ARB was defined as a patient with a positive blood culture with no apparent source other than the vascular access catheter. ARB's were calculated in events per 100 patient months with 3 cohorts. Cohort 1 was observed for 12 months, Cohort 2 for the subsequent 10 months, and Cohort 3 for the final 10 months. Cohort 1 had weekly transparent dressing changes, cleansing of the skin and 5 minute soaking of the connection lines with 10% povidone-iodine (PI) solution, and HCW use of clean gloves and face shield without a mask. Cohort 2 changes consisted of thrice weekly gauze dressing changes, skin cleansing with ChloraPrep, a 2% CHG/70% isopropyl alcohol applicator, masks on the patients, adding a face mask to the shield, and application of 10% PI ointment to the exit site. Cohort 3 changes included weekly application of BioPatch (BioP), an antimicrobial dressing with CHG, sterile glove use, and replacing the PI line soaks with 4% CHG. Results:?The catheter-associated ARB rate per 100 patient months was 7.9 (17ARB/216 patient months) in Cohort 1, 8.6 (13/151) in Cohort 2, and 4.7 (5/107) in Cohort 3(p?=?0.31 compared with Cohorts 1 and 2 combined). During the last 2 months, in Cohort 3, 9 catheter lumen cracks occurred, with one of the patients having a bacteremia. Conclusions:?Addition of CHG line soaks and BioP reduced tunneled catheter infections, although this is not statistically significant. The increased number of catheter lumen cracks raises concern with the use of CHG line soaks. Further investigation with use of CHG line soaks and the BioP for decreasing ARB is needed.

AB  - Abstract Bottom-up tissue engineering is a promising approach for designing modular biomimetic structures that aim to recapitulate the intricate hierarchy and biofunctionality of native human tissues. In recent years, this field has seen exciting progress driven by an increasing knowledge of biological systems and their rational deconstruction into key core components. Relevant advances in the bottom-up assembly of unitary living blocks toward the creation of higher order bioarchitectures based on multicellular-rich structures or multicomponent cell?biomaterial synergies are described. An up-to-date critical overview of long-term existing and rapidly emerging technologies for integrative bottom-up tissue engineering is provided, including discussion of their practical challenges and required advances. It is envisioned that a combination of cell?biomaterial constructs with bioadaptable features and biospecific 3D designs will contribute to the development of more robust and functional humanized tissues for therapies and disease models, as well as tools for fundamental biological studies.

AB  - Purpose: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred blood access for hemodialysis due to its longevity and resistance to infection. Little attention is given to the long-term hemodynamic consequences of large left-to-right shunts, particularly in patients with brachial artery fistulae. Materials and Methods:?We describe 9 patients (8 on dialysis, 1 post-transplant), aged 25?73, who developed clinical heart failure, primarily due to large, upper arm AVFs. Results:?4/9 had access flows in excess of 2 liters/min, assessed by blood temperature monitoring. 6/9 had cardiac output measured by right heart catheterization, before and after shunt compression. One also underwent left heart catheterization with ventriculography. 3/9 had surgical reduction of the fistula, either by banding or by serial interposition of small caliber GoreTex graft. In 2/9 the shunt was ligated. One patient had heart failure in association with 2 large, upper arm AVFs, one of which was ligated. After years of improved cardiac symptoms, heart failure recurred in association with marked hypertrophy of his remaining AVF. Resting cardiac output in this patient was in excess of 11 liters/min. 2/9 experienced acute onset of heart failure within 1?3 days of angioplasty of a venous stenosis. One of these, with very poor baseline cardiac function, expired. Surgical revision or ligation was accompanied by clinical improvement in the 5 patients so treated. One of these expired of a stroke after two months of cardiac improvement. Conclusion:?High output heart failure is under-diagnosed in dialysis patients. Patients with large upper arm shunts are particularly at risk. Access flow should be assessed regularly and those with outputs >1.5 liters/min should be monitored closely for development of heart failure. Surgical correction is beneficial and indicated in symptomatic patients.

AB  - Introduction:? Hemolytic reactions developing during hemodialysis usually are caused by oxidant damage, reduction injury, and osmolar, thermal, and mechanical injury to the red blood cells. Mechanical injury due to maloccluded blood pumps, arterial line collapse, and use of subclavian hemodialysis catheters has been reported. We report one episode of acute hemolysis due to kinked hemodialysis blood lines complicated with pancreatitis. Case Report:?An 18-year-old man with end-stage renal failure of unknown origin had been on hemodialysis since 2002. His past medical history included asthma and hypertension. He was admitted to the hospital because of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting during the dialysis session. Laboratory examination showed hematocrit ?30?%, platelet count of 131,000 per cubic mL, LDH ?5151?U/L, haptoglobin ?0.09?g/L, lipase ?919?U/L, CPK- 260, ASAT ?584?U/L, ALAT- 316?U/L, bilirubin ?36??mol/L, and visible schistocytes on smear. Examination of the abdomen revealed diffuse discomfort and tenderness in epigastrium. The patient was diagnosed as having hemolysis-induced acute pancreatitis. He was treated symptomatically and recovered within a few days. We found the arterial blood line tightly kinked at the dialyser inlet port, and we excluded other reported causes of intravascular hemolysis during hemodialysis. Discussion:?Until a critical pressure is exceeded, despite a kink in the post pump predialyser blood tubing, the blood pump can maintain sufficient blood flow to prevent an increase in the arterial pressure with a triggering of the arterial alarm and a decrease in the venous pressure with a triggering of the venous alarm. Thus, an excessively high pressure can be maintained in this silent segment of the dialyser tubing without activating the pressure alarms, exposing the red blood cells to high sheer stresses and resulting in clinically significant hemolysis. Acute hemolysis can cause a life-threatening acute pancreatitis. The literature indicates that acute pancreatitis is a complication of massive hemolysis with a prevalence of about 20%. The important role of inflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis is well known. Heme released from hemoglobin after episodes of vascular hemolysis has the potential to act as a signalling molecule involved in the triggering of the inflammatory processes associated with massive hemolysis. Hemolysis itself may induce acute pancreatitis by all or some pathways of neutrophil activation and chemoattraction, such as oxidative burst, direct proinflammatory effect, microcirculatory disturbance, and increased expression of proinflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines.

AB  - Background:? Among patients receiving chronic HD, therapy with paricalcitol (Z) was associated with reduced mortality and morbidity compared to treatment with calcitriol (C). Furthermore, patients who did not receive any vitamin D therapy experienced highest mortality and morbidity. This study examined the hypothesis of a relationship between the dose of Z and subsequent hospitalization, more specifically, that patients receiving lower doses of Z would have a higher risk of being hospitalized. Methods:?We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients new to HD who received treatment with Z or C between Jan 1999 and Dec 2001 using Poisson regression models. The primary exposure variable was the average dose/day, examined as categorical data by quintiles, during a 3-month and then 12-month follow-up period excluding the days in hospitals. This latter exclusion was made due to uncertainty of the treatment during the period of hospitalization. Additional covariates included vitamin-D group (Z vs. C), age, gender, race, and diabetes status, serum albumin, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphorus, and iPTH. Results:?We first examined dose of Z and C over a 3-month period and then hospitalizations over the ensuing year. We did not find a dose-response relationship in these analyses ? i.e., dose over the first three months of dialysis is not associated with increased or reduced risk of hospitalizations during the ensuing 12 months. We then examined average dose of Z or C over the entire year and risk for hospitalization during the same year. Compared to total doses, average doses (total dose over the entire year divided by number of dialysis sessions during the same year) are less prone to bias. Risk of hospitalizations according to dose (lowest dose, Quintile 1) of injectable vitamin D is shown in the table below: Quintile HR 95% CI 1 1.093 1.025?1.165 2 1.073 1.007?1.143 3 1.055 0.990?1.124 4 1.050 0.978?1.116 5 1.0 REF Compared to those who received the highest doses of injectable vitamin D, those receiving the lowest had a 9% increased risk for a hospitalization. At each level, the risk for hospitalizations was 4% lower with Z compared to C. Conclusion:?This pilot study indicates that higher average doses of Z are associated with a lower risk of hospitalization and suggests additional beneficial effects of vitamin D beyond mineral metabolism and PTH control.

AB  - Objective:? In this study, we initiated a new hemodialysate with citrate buffer, observed the factors that influence the citrate concentration of solution in hollow fibers when using citrate hemodialysate, and observed the anticoagulant effect and safety of the citrate hemodialysate in the experiment in dogs. Methods:?Ten dogs were given intermittent hemodialysis and were divided into 3 groups according to hemodialysis procedures. Group 1 was saline-flush hemodialysed with bicarbonate hemodialysate; Group 2 was hemodialysed with citrate hemodialysis without any anticoagulant; Group 3 was hemodialysed with bicarbonate hemodialysate and heparin. ACT, Ca++, BUN, Cr, ALT, AST, TBIL, DBIL, Na+, Cl?, , and venous pressure were monitored in the animals of each group during hemodialysis. Results:?During the hemodialysis in Group 1, venous pressure increased lastingly, resulting in the failure of hemodialysis for 2 hours. Hemodialysis for 2 hours in Group 2 were all finished successfully. ACT was extended and Ca++ decreased obviously in the venous end during hemodialysis. And ALT, AST, Ca++, K+, Na+, Cl?, after the hemodialysis in Group 2 were not changed (P?>?0.05). Moreover, the clearance rate of the dialyzers with citrate dialysate increased significantly compared with those of saline-flush and heparin anticoagulation. Conclusions:?The anticoagulant and dialytic effects of the new type citrate hemodialysis are satisfactory and better than that of saline-flush.

AB  - Objective:? This observational study was undertaken to evaluate the frequency of acute complications occurring during dialysis sessions and their association with other clinical and biochemical parameters. Method:?Forty-six maintenance hemodialysis patients were selected and evaluated. Mean of the weekly evaluations of different parameters over a three-month period is presented here. Result:?Age of study subjects was 39?±?13 years and body mass index (BMI) 21?±?4?kg/m2. Duration of hemodialysis was 41?±?29 months. Most of the patients were hypertensive (98%), taking multiple anti-hypertensive drugs. Mean of the blood pressures before and at the end of dialysis sessions over the three month period were: systolic blood pressure (SBP) 159?±?18 vs. 163?±?22 (p?<?0.05) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 92?±?13 vs. 87?±?7?mmHg (p?<?0.003). Frequency of acute complicating symptoms during dialysis sessions were: headache (75%), rise in blood pressure (73%), leg cramps (67%), vomiting (60%), palpitation (58%), sweating (52%), and hypotension (35%). Raised blood pressure showed a positive correlation with headache (r?=?0.50, p?<?0.01) and sweating (r?=?0.53, p?<?0.05). Vomiting and palpitation were more frequent at low post-dialysis blood pressure (vomiting vs. post-SBP-r?=??0.41, p?<?0.05 and palpitation vs. post-DBP-r?=??0.48, p?<?0.05), and these patients were likely to get inadequate dialysis (hypotension vs. Kt/V-r?=??0.63, p?<?0.01). Pre and post dialysis weight variation was 53?±?11 vs. 51?±?11?kg (p?<?0.001), average ultrafiltration during dialysis (UF)?2.39 (0.5?4) liter and single session Kt/V was 0.95?±?0.38. The rising tendency of post-dialysis blood pressure correlated positively with increasing UF (SBP vs. UF-r?=?0.36, p?<?0.01 and DBP vs. UF-r?=?0.25, p?<?0.05). Conclusion:?From this study it may be concluded that acute complications during dialysis sessions have a significant correlation with deranged blood pressure regulation, and optimum control of blood pressure could provide better dialysis.

AB  - Hemodialysis is a common treatment of chronic renal failure, also in childhood. Due to the high standard of technique there are only few contraindications for this treatment at present. Limitations are given by the vessel access. But in the last years, hemodialysis has been made practicable by the permanent central venous catheter, however, with more problems. As an example for potential complications in the treatment with the permanent catheter we present an unusual case report about a twenty-one- year-old girl suffering from chronic renal failure due to reflux nephropathy, Prader-Willi- syndrome, myelonatrophia of undetermined origin with spastic diplegia of the legs, and increasing sphincter ani dysfunction. We started the renal replacement therapy when the girl was 15 years old. It was not possible to create an AV fistula due to very small vessels. Two Gore-Tex ? implants were clotted in absence of thrombophilia. Afterwards, the hemodialysis was performed by a permanent central venous catheter. The catheter had to be changed 15 times. The reasons for changing the catheter were problems of flow during hemodialysis due to clotting, dislocations, spontaneous removing of the catheter by herself, and infections. Altogether a sepsis occurred four times. The first transplantation failed due to a rupture of the transplanted kidney. A second transplantation was not possible because of the high BMI. Intermittently, the girl was treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) in the hospital, because the PD couldn?t be done at home due to different reasons. Only on weekends could the girl go home. The PD had to be finished after 6 months due to a severe psychotic syndrome. The girl died at age 21, caused by a sepsis following the 15th change of the catheter. A huge problem of frequent catheter changing is the limited availability of vessel accesses ? the limits of treatment by hemodialysis.

AB  - Copper (CU) deficiency, as reflected by a low serum CU and ceruloplasmin (CER) level, is a rare complication of chronic HD. When present, common clinical manifestations include anemia and neutropenia. Anecdotally, CU deficiency has been linked to the use of sevelamer hydrochloride (SH), a recently introduced phosphate binding agent. The finding of severe CU deficiency and rHuEPO-resistant anemia in 3 of our patients (pts) prompted a review of our entire pediatric HD population for the frequency of CU deficiency and its possible relationship to SH. An assessment of serum CU was conducted in 17 pts (male-11; mean age 169.4?+?49.6?mo) who had received HD for 21.5?+?33.9 months. All pts received three 4-hour HD sessions weekly with mean single-pool and equilibrated Kt/V values of 2.29?+?2.5 and 1.56?+?0.37, respectively. 14 of 17 (82%) pts had low serum CU levels with a mean value of 69.1?+?38.3?mcG/DL (normal?= 85?150?mcG/DL). 9 of 17 (53%) pts had values <60?mcG/DL and 3?pts had values <25?mcG/DL with CER values of 1.2?mg/dL, 0.6?mg/dL, and 1.8?mg/dL, respectively (normal?=?24?40?mg/dL). In the latter 3?pts, hemoglobin values fell to 5.4?gm/dL, 5.2?gm/dL, and 9.2?gm/dL despite regular rHuEPO dosing and adequate iron stores and all pts responded to supplemental CU therapy. The mean hemoglobin of the remaining 14?pts was 11.7?+?1.3?gm/dL. Whereas 13 of 14 (93%) CU deficient pts were receiving SH (142.1?+?112.3?mg/kg/d) for 331.0?+?293.6 days at the time of the CU assessment, there was no significant relationship demonstrated between the dose of SH or the duration of SH therapy and the serum CU level. In conclusion, CU deficiency appears to commonly occur in pediatric HD pts with extremely low values associated with profound anemia responsive to CU therapy. While the chronology of CU deficiency and the introduction of SH suggests an association, additional research is necessary to address this issue in a more definitive manner.

AB  - Purpose: Limited information exists on the use of any intravenous iron preparation in pediatric HD patients. This study was designed to describe the PK parameters of FG, now approved for use in children on HD. Methods:Iron-deficient pediatric HD pts (≤15?yr) were randomized to 2 doses of FG. Blood samples taken during a 1?hr infusion and at intervals over 48?hrs were analyzed for total iron, transferrin-bound iron (TBI), and FG-bound iron (FGI). Results:49% of pts were male, 88% white, 57% age 6?12?yr, wt 16.3?63.2?Kg, ht 100?177.5?cm. Mean serum iron concentrations (total iron and FGI) rapidly increased in a dose-dependent manner, approximately proportional to the FG dose administered. A rapid rise in total serum iron was followed by a slower, less prominent rise in TBI. Single-dose PK of FGI was adequately described using non-compartmental analytical methods. A standard 2-compartment NONMEM model successfully fit the data and accurately described the time-course of FGI concentrations. Pharmacokinetic Parameter 1.5?mg/kg FG (n?=?22) 3.0?mg/kg FG (n?=?26) Cmax(mean?±?SD,?mcg/dL) 1287?±?285 ???2283?±?637 AUC0?48(mean?±?SD,?mcg·hr/dL) 9327?±?4038 16,830?±?6526 AUC0?∞(mean?±?SD,?mcg·hr/dL) 9499?±?4089 17,087?±?6776 Tmax(mean?±?SD,?hrs) ???1.1?±?0.23 ???1.1?±?0.19 t1/2(mean?±?SD,?hrs) ???2.0?±?0.7 ???2.5?±?1.8 Kel(mean?±?SD,?hr?1) ??0.43?±?0.30 ??0.39?±?0.27 Cl (mean?±?SD,?L/hr) ??0.69?±?0.50 ??0.66?±?0.52 Vd(mean?±?SD,?L) ???1.6?±?0.6 ???1.9?±?1.1 Conclusions: Cmax values in pediatric HD population were similar to Cmax values previously reported with similar FG doses in healthy iron-deficient adults (Ferrlecit? prescribing information). In contrast, mean AUC0?∞ values were approximately 2 times greater, and mean Cl rates were 5.4 times slower in pediatric pts.

AB  - In this paper we?ll discuss how change management affects hemodialysis improvement. As hemodialysis is a technology dependent method of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) treatment, it is obvious that the need of continuous revisions in health care practices and researches on staff training are significant factors for success. ?Change? defined as an attempt to replace existing knowledge with new. Change achievement is not always a simple procedure. In this study we examine nurses and patients reactions on changes and how can we accomplish successful changes every time they are needed. We also examine how changes in role of health care team can lead the team to our final destination, which is to provide the best hemodialysis treatment we can. Leadership, communication, informing, planning, and adjusting are the main contents for successful change management. We believe that we can improve haemodialysis practices and health care by giving learning opportunities to our nurses. Nursing training development can help them to follow changes. On the other hand we can get our patients to come on board with us on any change by encouragement and consistent try. As Hereticus said, ?Nothing that is, has to be just because it is.? Therefore, we should keep thinking about managing changes all the time!

AB  - Background:? Central venous stenosis in chronic hemodialysis patients occurs in about 17% of all venous stenosis and it is associated with central vein catheterization. We evaluated the effect of percutaneous angioplasty and stenting in the treatment of central venous stenosis in hemodialysis patients. Methods:?We retrospectively investigated the medical records of a total of 31 dialysis patients who had central venous stenosis. We reviewed the causes of central venous stenosis, clinical manifestations, venographic findings, and patency rate of radiological intervention. Results:?Of the total 31 patients, 28 patients had past history of central vein catheterization ipsilateral to vascular access. Mean duration of the catheterization was 32?±?14 days. Venography showed complete obstruction of central vein (n?=?14) and stenosis (n?=?17). The site of venous lesion was right subclavian vein (n?=?11), innominate vein (n?=?9), left subclavian vein (n?=?7), and superior vena cava (n?=?14). A total of 30 procedures of angioplasty with or without stenting were performed in 26 of 31 patients. Initial success rate was 96.1% and there was no severe complication such as rupture or bleeding. The primary patency rate at 6, 12, 24, and 48 months after the procedure was 87.3%, 75.6%, 67.9%, and 65.4%, respectively. The cumulative patency rate at the same time point was 96.0%, 90.6%, 74.0%, and 72.8%, respectively. Conclusion:?Our data suggest that angioplasty with or without stenting is safe and effective in the treatment of central venous stenosis in hemodialysis patients.

AB  - Introduction:? Thrombolytic therapy is an important treatment modality for thrombosis-related catheter occlusion. Central venous access devices (CAVDs) are essential tools for the administration of many therapeutic modalities, especially for patients requiring lifetime therapy like hemodialysis. There are several reasons to salvage the occluded catheter. Catheter replacement results in an interruption of therapy delivery. This interruption may result in complications such as life-threatening metabolic and physiologic states. In addition, the patient's future access sites for CAVDs may be affected. The data released in the 2001 Annual Report ? ESRD Clinical Performance Measures Project (Department of Health and Human Services, December 2001) shows 17% of prevalent patients were dialyzed with a chronic catheter continuously for 90 days or longer. In the pediatric population the data shows that 31% were dialyzed with a chronic catheter. The most common reasons for catheter placement included: no fistula or graft created (42%) and fistula and graft were maturing, not ready to cannulate (17%). Five percent of patients were not candidates for fistula or graft placement as all sites had been exhausted. Methods:?A short study was done in our medical center to evaluate the results of t-PA vs. changing the tunnel catheter. On an average a catheter costs about $400.00. If you add the cost of specialty personnel such as an interventional radiologist, radiology technician, radiology nurse, and the ancillaries such as the room, sutures, gauze, and tape, the total could reach $2000.00 easily. Cathflo? Activase? costs around $60.00 for a single dose. T-PA was reconstituted by pharmacy personnel in single vials containing 2?mg/2?ml. Now with Cathflo, vials are stored in the renal clinic's refrigerator and when the need arises, the RN reconstitutes the medication. The RN, using established protocols, will instill Cathflo in the catheter following the volume requirements of the various tunnel catheters. After the t-PA is placed, the patient is sent home with instructions to return to their dialysis center the next day (arrangements are made by the RN as needed). In seventeen patients (17) with tunnel catheter malfunctions due to inadequate flow, not related to placement, t-PA was used. Of those 17 patients 2 were unable to use their catheter on their next dialysis treatment date, yielding an 88% success rate. This compares with clinical trials in which there is an 83% success rate with a dwell time of 4 hours, or an 89% rate on patients having a 2 hour dwell time (t-PA was repeated a second time if flow was not successfully restored. Results:?15/17 patients in our retrospective study showed that Cathflo worked successfully in restoring blood flow. Two catheters needed to be exchanged. The cost savings were significant when we compared the average cost of an exchange ($2000) versus using t-PA ($170 including nursing time). Conclusion:?Cathflo is not just safe and practical to use but also cost effective.

AB  - Purpose:? Performed free coagulant hemodialysis to patients having hemorrhage with the hope to avoid aggravation of bleeding caused by anticoagulant agent from dialysis. Method:? Examined 19 cases of patients with bleeding tendency, whether it is possible to perform free coagulant hemodialysis by using PAES membrane, EVAL membrane, PS membrane, Cellulose triacetate membrane and Vitamin-E modified-dialysis membrane. Result:?With PAES membrane, the result showed a non- blockade rate of 91% after four hours and 100% after two hours. Therefore, blockade was prevented with a fairly high rate. In cases of blockade, most of them were possibly avoidable with a little contrivance as the reason were lack of establish blood flow rate, faulty position of a needle, etc. Conclusions:?By using PAES membrane, it was possible to perform free coagulant hemodialysis. In order to completely have no blockade of blood lines in the future, we must strive further on.
