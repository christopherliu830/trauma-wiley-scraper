AB  - The increase in number of obese people seen in the general population, is also what is seen in the hemodialyzed population. It is generally believed that the location of deep forearm vessels in the subcutaneous fat tissue makes primary arteriovenous fistula (AVF) a disadvantage because of difficulties in vessel puncturing. For obese patients, it is suggested that a fistula with PTFE is created or a central catheter inserted, but these solutions increase already high morbidity rate and significantly increase mortality rate. Methods:?The deep location of veins situated on the anterior part of the forearm involved 57 patients (45 female and 12 male) aged 13?87 years (mean 67?±?15.2 years). Patients? body mass index (BMI) ranged from 29.1 to 53.73 (mean 34.6?±?7.8). The causes of the renal failure were diabetic nephropathy in 30 patients, chronic glomerulonephritis in 4, hypertensive nephrosclerosis in 5, lupus nephritis in 2, interstitial nephritis in 4, primary amyloidosis in 1, polycystic kidney disease in 3, and unknown in 3 patients.Two-step surgical procedure was performed in all patients. In the first stage, the standard distal radiocephalic AVF in the wrist region was created. In case of its failure, the next attempt was performed above the point of the first intervention. In the second stage, superficialization of the venous part of AVF was performed in the mode described by us (Kidney 2002;.1:1170). Results:?The first stage of the procedure was successful in 46 patients. In 6 cases it was necessary to perform a second attempt, and 2 cases required three operations. The second stage was undertaken in all of these patients (n?=?54), and complete success was achieved in 51. In 3 cases, in spite of superficialization, AVF was not suitable for puncturing because of poor blood flow. The causes of failure of the first stage procedure in 2 patients were severe arteriosclerosis and venous anomaly. All patients had non-altered cephalic veins in the wrist region, as opposed to patients with cannulated veins. In 51?pts (90%) an efficient flow of the blood through AVF was successfully obtained and allowed satisfactory dialyses. Conclusions:?The primary AVF creation on the forearm is feasible in 90% of obese patients. This result is similar to the general population of chronic renal disease patients of our center (95%)(NDT 1998;13:527) and is possible thanks to the location of the veins deep in the subcutaneous fat tissue, which protects against repeated cannulation and hence mechanical destruction in the pre-dialysis period.

AB  - Introduction:? Vascular access failure is one of the greatest sources of morbidity for chronic hemodialysis patients. Prophylactic and repeated measurement of access flow may be of importance in preventing clotting. The aim of the study was therefore to analyse the cost effectiveness of a shunt surveillance program, which reduces the appearance of occlusion of the vascular access. Methods: The number of vascular access interventions (surgery and radiology) in the period 2001 till 2003 (transonic measurement period, TMP; 63 patients) was compared with a reference period (RP, 1996 till 1998) during which no access flow was measured (58 patients). All measurements were done with Transonic? and interventions according to K/DOQI. Results:?During the RP, 123 vascular access operations (0.71 per patient year) were performed because of occlusion, whereas in the TMP 58 vascular access operations (0.3 per patient year) were performed. During the TMP, 298 angiographic measurements were performed (1.6 per patient year) in the RP 177, (1.0 per patient year). In the TMP, 1652 access flow measurements were performed. In order to prevent one shunt occlusion, 21 access flow measurements had to be performed. Total costs in the TMP (summary of angiography, angiography and PTA, hospitalization days, and operation costs) are reduced with 31% compared to the RP; costs per patient year in RP: ?2315. Costs per patient year in TMP: ?1606. Conclusion:?By means of a shunt surveillance program (based on access flow measurement), if necessary followed by angiography, it is possible to reduce the number of acute vascular access occlusions. Although a shunt surveillance program may take up a lot of time for the nursing staff, the beneficial effects, lower costs, and reduced morbidity for the patients outweigh this effort.

AB  - Purpose:? The use of tunneled, cuffed central venous catheters for hemodialysis is associated with poor flow, thrombosis, and infections due to the transcutaneous nature of these devices. A new design for a sutureless, tunneled cuffed catheter was evaluated in hemodialysis patients to determine the effect of its design on the incidence of exit site infection. Methods:?A polyurethane conduit with a uniquely designed cuff and subcutaneous skirt covered with Dacron velour was attached to standard double lumen central venous catheters. Seven (7) Ash catheters and one (1) Tesio catheter were fitted with the overtube and skirt and implanted in eight (8) patients undergoing routine hemodialysis. Patients were monitored for exit site infection, tunnel infection, bacteremia, cuff extrusion, and serosanguineous exudate. Results:?Catheters were implanted for 6 to 26 weeks. All catheters remained patent and no cases of bacteremia were observed. There was no evidence of exit site or tunnel infection, and no reported serosanguineous exudate from the exit site. Exit site care consisted of soap and water cleansing by the patient. Patients were able to shower or bathe 4 weeks post-implant. Conclusions:?The new design for a subcutaneous cuff and skirt appears to inhibit exit site infection and other common complications of central venous catheters.

AB  - Objective:? To observe the factors that affect the citrate concentration in hollow fiber when using citrate hemodialysate. Methods:?By modeling hemodialysis in vitro, we studied 6 types of hemodialyzers at different blood flow rates, different dialysate flow-rate, and different fluids in vitro to detect the citrate concentration in hollow fiber. Results:?The citrate concentrations in different hemodialyzers were F60?>?FB-130UGA?>?GA-HP130?>?F6?>?FB-130AGA?>?WS-70 in turn. The concentrations at different blood flow-rates were different 100?mL/min?>?200?mL/min. Conclusions:?The concentration of citrate in hollow fiber is affected by different types of hemodialyzers and different blood as well as dialysate flow-rates. To achieve anticoagulation when using citrate hemodialysate, we must select suitable hemodialyzer such as FB-130UGA.

AB  - Abstract Bottom-up tissue engineering is a promising approach for designing modular biomimetic structures that aim to recapitulate the intricate hierarchy and biofunctionality of native human tissues. In recent years, this field has seen exciting progress driven by an increasing knowledge of biological systems and their rational deconstruction into key core components. Relevant advances in the bottom-up assembly of unitary living blocks toward the creation of higher order bioarchitectures based on multicellular-rich structures or multicomponent cell?biomaterial synergies are described. An up-to-date critical overview of long-term existing and rapidly emerging technologies for integrative bottom-up tissue engineering is provided, including discussion of their practical challenges and required advances. It is envisioned that a combination of cell?biomaterial constructs with bioadaptable features and biospecific 3D designs will contribute to the development of more robust and functional humanized tissues for therapies and disease models, as well as tools for fundamental biological studies.

AB  - WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT? ??It is well known that tobramycin given as an once daily dose according to the usual recommendations needs therapeutic drug monitoring by measurement of peak and trough concentrations. In the literature, there are only few published studies on the population pharmacokinetics of once daily tobramycin in critically ill patients. Glomerular filtration rate and bodyweight were identified as covariates contributing to the inter-individual variability in the disposition of aminoglycosides. The study, by Peris-Marti et?al. [24], only evaluated the pharmacodynamic effectiveness of a 4?mg?kg?1 dose of tobramycin given once daily in critically ill patients. The authors concluded with a simulation showing that for a theoretical MIC of 1 or 2?mg?l?1, a 7?mg?kg?1 dose was required. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS? ??Our results confirm the high variability of tobramycin disposition in intensive care patients and consequently the possible lack of effectiveness. ??By using a population pharmacokinetic approach, two explicative covariates (height and Cockcroft creatinine clearance) added to a two-compartment model with proportional error, explained much of the inter-individual variability of tobramycin disposition in the critically ill patient population. ??In a median ICU patient, simulations were performed at various dosage regimens and peak and AUC pharmacodynamic targets could not be reached simultaneously in more than 45% of the ICU patient population. Drug monitoring is required to manage efficacy and toxicity. AIM The aim of this study was to evaluate the disposition of tobramycin (TOB) in critically ill patients (ICU) by a population pharmacokinetic approach, to determine the covariates involved, and to simulate tobramycin dosage regimens. METHODS Forty-nine adult ICU patients received TOB (5?mg?kg?1) once daily. NonMem modelling was performed on 32 patients. The 17 other patients were used for the qualification process by normalized prediction distribution error. Then Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) were performed. RESULTS A two-compartment model with a proportional error best fitted the data. TOB total clearance (CLTOB) was significantly correlated with Cockcroft creatinine clearance (COCK) and height. TOB clearance was 4.8 ± 1.9?l?h?1 (range 1.22?8.95), the volume of distribution of the central compartment was 24.7 ± 3.7?l (range 17.34?32.83) and that of the peripheral compartment and the inter-compartmental clearance were 30.6?l and 4.74?l?h?1, respectively. Only 29% of the patients presented a target AUC between 80 and 125?mg?l?1?h and 61% were lower than 80?mg?l?1?h. After considering COCK and height, MCS showed that only 50% of the population could achieve the target AUC for the 375 and 400?mg dosages. CONCLUSION Even after taking into account COCK and height, for strains with an MIC ≤ 1?mg?l?1, MCS doses evidenced that peak and AUC pharmacodynamic targets could not be reached simultaneously in more than 45% of the ICU patient population. Combination therapy in addition to drug monitoring are required to manage efficacy and toxicity.

AB  - Introduction:? Hemoperfusion, with or without hemodialysis, has been used to treat patients suffering from severe valproic acid poisoning. We report a patient suffering from severe valproic acid intoxication who was treated effectively with high-flux hemodialysis alone. Case:?A 20-year-old man with a history of bipolar disorder was admitted after having ingested unknown amounts of valproic acid (Depakote?), prednisone, and erythromycin. He was agitated and obtunded but hemodynamically stable initially. Serum valproic acid level was 1,028??g/mL. Urine toxicology screen as well as serum levels of ethanol, acetaminophen, and acetylsalicylic acid levels were negative. A gastric lavage was followed by activated charcoal instillation. Subsequent myoclonic twitchings that progressed to continuous seizure activity were managed with intravenous lorazepam therapy and endotracheal intubation. Serum valproic acid value measured two hours after admission remained elevated at 1,046??g/mL. Hemodialysis was performed continuously for 10.5 hours using a high-flux, polysulfone dialyzer (Polyflux 21S, Fresenius Medical Care, Lexington, MA), a dialyzer blood flow of 200?300?mL/min, and a dialysate flow of 500?mL/min. The therapy brought about a fall in serum valproic acid level to 110??g/mL and a complete recovery of the patient. Discussion:?Valproic acid (144 Dalton) is 90?95% protein-bound at therapeutic serum values. However, in the face of an overdose, the unbound fraction rises because of saturation of protein-binding sites. This unbound fraction is readily dialyzable. We suggest that high-flux hemodialysis is effective in the treatment of severe valproic acid poisoning.

AB  - One of the basic symptoms of a terminal stage chronic renal insufficiency is anemia. From everything, used methods of correction of an anemia, it is considered the most effective application of preparations recombinant human erythropoietin (r-Hu EPO). Since 1994 in the Scientific Centre of Surgery begins application r-Hu EPO. Application r-Hu EPO in patients with a terminal stage chronic renal insufficiency in 90?95% of cases had a positive effect, but 5?10% of patients have intolerance to erythropoietin, that has induced to search of new effective methods of correction of anemia. During research were determined quantity erythrocytes, hemoglobin, reticulocyte in peripheral blood and acid-alkaline condition of blood. All hematology parameters were defined at the beginning of treatment, over 5 day and for 15 day of stimulation of a bone marrow. For 15 days after stimulation of a bone marrow by the laser there was an authentic increase of quantity erythrocyte, hemoglobin, hematocrit. The initial contents erythrocytes made 2.22?±?0.1 10???12, hemoglobin 67.7?±?3.2?g/l and hematocrit 18.2?±?1.2%. During treatment by the laser parameters erythrocytes have increased up to 2.9?±?0.8 10???12, hemoglobin up to 89.6?±?2.9?g/l and hematocrit up to 28.2?±?1.3%(P?<?0,005). Hematology parameters in blood of control group authentically have not changed.

AB  - Tunneled-cuffed hemodialysis catheters are frequently used as long-term vascular access in children due to the technical difficulties in constructing a fistula. Catheter-related bacteremia (CRB) is still a major complication contributing to patient morbidity and loss of vascular access. Objective:?To investigate the microbiological characteristics of CRB in children on hemodialysis. Methods:?Chart review of 63 children who received hemodialysis with a tunneled-cuffed catheter between January 1999 and December 2003 was performed. CRB was diagnosed when positive blood cultures were obtained in patients with symptoms of bacteremia, and without an identifiable source. Results:?During the 5 year period, a total of 251 CRB were detected with 313 bacterial and 2 candidal growths in the blood cultures. The distribution of gram positive (Gr+) and gram negative (Gr?) microorganisms and their sensitivity patterns are shown in the table. Coagulase negative Staphylococcus was the most common microorganism, and constituted 62% of all bacterial isolates. All Gr+ microorganisms were sensitive to vancomycin except one isolate of Enterococcus fecalis. Enterobacter cloacae was the most common Gr? microorganism, followed by Klebsiella pneumonia. The sensitivity of Gr? microorganisms to levofloxacin was 100%. The treatment course was complicated by the growth of a second microorganism in subsequent blood cultures in 24% of infections; 54% of these consisted of both Gr+ and Gr? isolates. The etiology of ESRD or the use of immunosuppressive agents had no effect on the occurrence of CRB. The average number of infections were 5.8/1000 catheter days, and the recurrence of CRB was more likely in patients who had two or more CRB in a year. 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Gr+ growth 80% 88% 87% 85% 73% Oxacillin resistance 84% 73% 82% 68% 75% Gr? growth 20% 12% 13% 15% 27% Tobramycin resistance 21% 50% 25% 20% 13% Conclusions: Empiric initial treatment for CRB should include both Gr+, and Gr? coverage. Oxacillin and first generation cephalosporins are not good choices due to high incidence of resistance. Levofloxacin is a good alternative for Gr CRB. Novel preventive measures should be sought in patients who have a tendency to have recurrent CRB.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate and describe biochemical indices of bone metabolism in 4 children on NHD. Method:The children, aged 12, 13, 14, and 16?yrs, have been treated exclusively on NHD for 6, 9, 9, and 15?mos. Subsequently, Pt 1 converted to a hybrid program of 4 nights on home nocturnal plus 1 session of in center conventional HD per week. Biochemical indices of bone metabolism have been collected prospectively. Results:All baseline pre-dialysis calcium levels were within normal ranges and each patient was started on a dialysis calcium concentration of 3.0?mEq/L. However, over time the number of asymptomatic biochemical hypocalcaemic episodes increased. The dialysate calcium concentration was increased to 3.5?mEq/L in one and decreased to 2.0?mEq/L in another who was hypercalcemic and receiving concurrent calcitonin for bone pain related to osteoporosis. In Pt 1, the dialysate calcium was increased to 3.5?mEq/L during nocturnal and continued on hybrid therapy. Including an evaluation of dietary intake, all 4 patients had a net positive calcium balance, ranging between 9.8 to 23.5?mmol (393?942?mg). A significant reduction in the predialysis phosphate level was observed in all 4 patients, and none required dietary restrictions or the use of phosphate binders within 2 months or vitamin D within 6 months of HND. In addition, phosphate was added to provide a dialysate concentration of 2.4?6.1?mEq/L to prevent hypophosphatemia. This is reflected by significant reductions in intact PTH levels to the desired range (twice the normal range) in all 4, but the level continued to drop to the normal range and below in 2. In Pt 1, after introduction of hybrid therapy, both levels of phosphate and PTH rose, necessitating recommencement of phosphate binders and vitamin D. Likewise, the (Ca???PO4) dropped and remained <55 in all 4 patients exclusively on NHD, but started to climb in Pt 1 during hybrid therapy. Conclusion:In our cohort of patients, NHD rapidly lowered plasma phosphate and PTH levels. With NHD, additional dialysate phosphate and possibly calcium may be necessary to prevent chronic losses and development of renal osteodystrophy, and caution is required to prevent either oversuppression of PTH and extraskeletal calcification.

AB  - Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis and vasculopathy of the skin and visceral organs. Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), the most acute and life threatening complication, occurs in 10?20% of adult patients with SSc and has not been reported in children. A 10-year-old girl was diagnosed with SSc when she presented with weakness and skin thickening. She had positive ANA and anti-Scl 70. Renal function, urinalysis, and blood pressure were normal. She was treated with steroids, penicillamin and methotrexate as well as amlodipine for Raynaud's phenomenon, but her diffuse skin thickening and contractures progressed and she became wheelchair bound and had poor growth despite nutrition through a G-tube. At age 15 (weight 28?kg), when evaluated for abdominal pain, she was found to have acute renal failure (BUN 54?mg/dl, creatinine 2.2?mg/dl) and hypertension. Despite therapy with enalapril, serum creatinine continued to rise and she became oligoanuric, requiring initiation of hemodialysis. BP was controlled with enalapril and dialysis but she remained dialysis dependent. Steroid therapy was discontinued and replaced by low dose cyclosporine. Enalapril was replaced by losartan because of leukopenia and BP remained normal. Over the next 2 years, she was treated with hemodialysis and did not experience any complications. She progressively had an outstanding overall clinical improvement, marked skin softening, and was able to walk independently. Renal function did not improve. 28 months after the SRC, she received LRD renal transplant. Immunosuppression included cyclosporine, mycophenolate and prednisone. Creatinine 2 months post-transplant is 0.7?mg/dl. SRC in children may progress to end-stage renal disease but can be treated successfully with dialysis and transplantation without significant complications.

AB  - Purpose:? Tunneled catheters as chronic dialysis access is a reality of chronic hemodialysis. Infection of the catheter is an unavoidable complication. We researched the possibility of using Na Citrate as capping because of its anticoagulant effects and bactericidal properties. Methods:?Rate of infections per 1000 calendar days with heparin capping was recorded for an eight month period before using Na Citrate. Flows <300?ml/min via catheters were also recorded for an eight month period before Na Citrate use, using treatments per 1000 calendar days. Both these parameters were recorded for an eight month period following the initiation of Na Citrate 4% for all catheters. Results:?Our infection rate using heparin was 2.2 infections per 1000 catheter days. Infection rate after use of Na citrate was 1.2 infections per 1000 calendar days. Catheter flows <300 were 5.6 per 1000 calendar days using heparin, and 9.2 per 1000 calendar days after use of Na Citrate. There were no reactions related to Na Citrate, and no symptomatic hypocalcemia. Conclusions:?Na Citrate is effective at reducing the number of infections when used as a capping solution for tunneled catheters. Na Citrate?capped catheters had more frequent declines in QB compared with heparin capping. Because of the availability of anti-thrombolytic agents to preserve catheter patency, Na Citrate makes a safe option as a capping agent for long-term catheter capping.

AB  - Ba.cil'lus. N.L. masc. n. Bacillus a rodlet. Firmicutes / ?Bacilli? / Bacillales / Bacillaceae / Bacillus Cells rod-shaped, straight or slightly curved, occurring singly and in pairs, some in chains, and occasionally as long filaments. Endospores are formed, no more than one to a cell; these spores are very resistant to many adverse conditions. Gram-positive, or Gram-positive only in early stages of growth, or Gram-negative. A meso-DAP direct murein cross-linkage type is commonest, but L-Lys-D-Glu, Orn-D-Glu and L-Orn-D-Asp have occasionally been reported. Motile by means of peritrichous or degenerately peritrichous flagella, or nonmotile. Aerobes or facultative anaerobes, but a few species are described as strictly anaerobic. The terminal electron acceptor is oxygen, replaceable by alternatives in some species. Most species will grow on routine media such as nutrient agar and blood agar. Colony morphology and size very variable between and within species. A wide diversity of physiological abilities is exhibited, ranging from psychrophilic to thermophilic, and acidophilic to alkaliphilic; some strains are salt tolerant and some are halophilic. Catalase is produced by most species. Oxidase-positive or -negative. Chemo-organotrophic; two species are facultative chemolithotrophs: prototrophs to auxotrophs requiring several growth factors. Mostly isolated from soil, or from environments that may have been contaminated directly or indirectly by soil, but also found in water, food and clinical specimens. The resistance of the spores to heat, radiation, disinfectants, and desiccation results in species being troublesome contaminants in operating rooms, on surgical dressings, in pharmaceutical products and in foods. Most species have little or no pathogenic potential and are rarely associated with disease in humans or other animals; an exception is Bacillus anthracis, the agent of anthrax; several other species may cause food poisoning and opportunistic infections, and strains of Bacillus thuringiensis are pathogenic to invertebrates. DNA G + C content (mol%): 32?66 (Tm ). Type species: Bacillus subtilis Cohn 1872, 174AL.

AB  - Background:? The incidence of infection in patients on chronic hemodialysis in higher than that of the general population. Infection is known to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. The vascular access is important for hemodialysis, but infection through this route is the most common source of bacteremia and can be lethal to the patients. Despite the high morbidity and mortality of bacteremia in patients on chronic hemodialysis, the clinical characteristics of bacteremia in hemodialysis patients is rarely reported yet in Korea. Methods:?We included 696 hemodialysis patients from January 1993 to December 2003 at Uijongbu St. Mary's Hospital. We investigated incidence, source, causative organisms, clinical manifestations, complication, and mortality of bacteremia. We compared clinical factors, morbidity, and mortality between arteriovenous fistula and central venous catheter groups. Results:?Total 52 cases of bacteremia occurred in 43 patients. The major source of infection was vascular access (48%). Staphylococcus aureus was most common organism isolated. Major complications were septic shock (9.6%), pneumonia (9.6%), infective endocarditis (3.8%), and aortic pseudoaneurysm (1.9%). Nine patients died from septic shock (n?=?4), aspiration pneumonia (n?=?2), hypoxic brain injury (n?=?1), gastrointestinal bleeding (n?=?1), and rupture of aortic pseudoaneurysm. The central venous catheter group (n?=?22) had higher incidences of vascular access as a source of infection (81.8% vs 23.3%, p?<?0.001) and staphylococcus as a causative organism (77.2% vs 50.0%, p?=?0.042) than the arteriovenous group. Conclusion:? This data shows that bacteremia causes high incidence of fatal complications and mortality. Therefore, careful management of vascular access as well as early detection of bacteremia is an important factor for the prevention of infection and proper antibiotic therapy should be started early.

AB  - Bacteremia is a common complication for hemodialysis (HD) patients (pts) with an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC). We studied our experience with CAB and noted that CAB occurred at an average of 96?±?98 days after CVC insertion. We wondered what percentage of CAB occurred in the first 21 days after CVC insertion and the spectrum of organisms. We prospectively collected data on all HD pts from 3 centers with a CVC who developed bacteremia between 1/1/03 and 8/31/04. Pts who developed CAB with an identifiable source of bacteremia were excluded. 131 episodes of CAB were identified; 34 (25.95%) occurred in ≤21 days. The mean?±?SDEV age of the pts developing CAB?>?21 days and ≤21 days was 63?±?17 and 61.5?±?15.4 years, respectively. Table 1 outlines the spectrum of organisms. There was a significantly greater incidence of CAB with Staphylococcus aureus(SA) and a significantly lower incidence of Staphylococcus epidermidis(SE) in the pts in whom a CAB developed ≤21 days after insertion. Table 1 <21 Days >21 Days P-Value SA 20 (58.8%) 21 (21.6%) p?<?0.01 SE ?2 (5.9%) 30 (30.9%) p?<?0.05 Other GP* ?7 (20.6%) 15 (15.5%) NS GN^ ?9 (26.5%) 40 (41.2%) NS *GP: gram-positive; GN?:?gram-negative We conclude that CAB occurs in the first 21 days after CVC insertion in 25% of our CVC pts. Pts developing CAB in the first 21 days are more likely to develop CAB with SA and less likely to develop CAB with SE than pts who develop CAB after 21 days. Empiric antibiotic choice and preventative strategies need to take these data into consideration.
