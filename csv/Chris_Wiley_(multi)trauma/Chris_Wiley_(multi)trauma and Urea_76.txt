AB  - Background:? Radon is a natural radioactive element found especially in drilled water wells. It may cause problems in HHD. In this study the occurrence and prevention of radiation exposure to radon among HHD patients was examined. Material and methods:?Since 1998, 103 patients have been trained for HHD and drilled wells were used in 7 patients. Apart from routine analyses, radon concentration was also determined. Results:?High radon concentration was observed in three drilled wells, in one of these 2000?Bq/L. Water was conducted into the HHD-equipment through a charcoal filter and reverse osmosis equipment. Radon concentration was less than 50?Bq/L in the purified water. It was thus considered acceptable for dialysis. As the charcoal filter adsorbs radon, its decay products build up in the filter and emit gamma radiation. Considering that the daily through-put of water is about 375 liters, the estimated dose rate for a radon concentration of 1,000?Bq/L is 0.4?microSv/h at one-meter distance. At this distance the annual dose would be 1.8?mSv, expecting a daily occupancy time of 12 hours. The average background gamma dose rate in Finnish dwellings is 0.1?microSv/h. National dose constraints of 3?mSv/year for adults and 1?mSv/year for children living in HHD-households have been recommended. Conclusions: Waterborne radon must be considered when planning of HHD in households where drilled wells are used. Elevated radon concentration should always be removed from household water. In addition, external gamma radiation from charcoal filters requires appropriate restrictions in order to achieve a safe treatment.

AB  - The analysis of infectious complications in patients after allotransplantation of a donor kidney. For the dynamic analysis of frequency of infection-purulent complications, all patients were divided into 2 groups. The first, control group included 33 patients who were operated from 2000 to 2002 (men-21, women-12, adults-28, children-5). The second, basic group included 35 patients (men-22 and women-13, adult-28, children-7), after allotransplantations, which have transferred operation?transplantations of kidney with 2003 on 2004. In the first group purulent?septic complications were marked at 9 patients (27.2%), from them two (6%) have died of a sepsis on a background of antibacterial therapy (cephalosporini 3 generations). Duration of treatment made from 7 up to 15 days. In the second group in the postoperative period purulent ? septic complications were marked at 5 of 35 patients (14,2%). All 35 patients in the second group after allotransplantation of a donor kidney carried out preventive antibacterial therapy maxipimi (cephalosporini IV generations) on dosage 1 gram 2 times per day in a combination with amykini intravenously during 7 days. Cases of development of sepsis in this group of patients were not observed. Thus, estimating the received results, it is possible to draw the conclusion, application of antibiotics of a wide spectrum (cephalosporini IV generations) the patient with a terminal stage chronic renal insufficiency after allotransplantation of a donor kidney were lowered with quantity of suppurations of postoperative wounds and occurrence of infectious complications on 13%.

AB  - Objective:? We report a patient with urosepsis, Lleptospira syndrome, TTP-HUS syndrome, fulminant hepatic failure, vasculitis syndrome and TSS treated with plasma component exchange. Methods:?Conditions for plasma component exchange were membrane plasma separator (Evacure EC-3A), substitute fluid (3?% albumin solution), blood flow rate (150?mL/min), filtration rate (30?mL/min), quantity of substitute fluid (4,600?mL) and anticoagulant (nafamostat mesilate 30?mg/hr). Result: Plasma component exchange in combination with hemodiafiltration induced a rapid remission of both hepatic toxicity and renal failure caused by streptococcal sepsis. Membrane plasma separator evacure EC-3A allowed the use of 3% albumin solution as substitute fluid. Colloid osmotic pressure temporarily increased after the treatment, but within 24 hours, returned to the same level as before the treatment. Conclusion:?Plasma component exchange using a membrane plasma separator may allow the use of albumin instead of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) as substitute fluid, which results in a lower risk of infection.

AB  - WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT? ??It is well known that tobramycin given as an once daily dose according to the usual recommendations needs therapeutic drug monitoring by measurement of peak and trough concentrations. In the literature, there are only few published studies on the population pharmacokinetics of once daily tobramycin in critically ill patients. Glomerular filtration rate and bodyweight were identified as covariates contributing to the inter-individual variability in the disposition of aminoglycosides. The study, by Peris-Marti et?al. [24], only evaluated the pharmacodynamic effectiveness of a 4?mg?kg?1 dose of tobramycin given once daily in critically ill patients. The authors concluded with a simulation showing that for a theoretical MIC of 1 or 2?mg?l?1, a 7?mg?kg?1 dose was required. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS? ??Our results confirm the high variability of tobramycin disposition in intensive care patients and consequently the possible lack of effectiveness. ??By using a population pharmacokinetic approach, two explicative covariates (height and Cockcroft creatinine clearance) added to a two-compartment model with proportional error, explained much of the inter-individual variability of tobramycin disposition in the critically ill patient population. ??In a median ICU patient, simulations were performed at various dosage regimens and peak and AUC pharmacodynamic targets could not be reached simultaneously in more than 45% of the ICU patient population. Drug monitoring is required to manage efficacy and toxicity. AIM The aim of this study was to evaluate the disposition of tobramycin (TOB) in critically ill patients (ICU) by a population pharmacokinetic approach, to determine the covariates involved, and to simulate tobramycin dosage regimens. METHODS Forty-nine adult ICU patients received TOB (5?mg?kg?1) once daily. NonMem modelling was performed on 32 patients. The 17 other patients were used for the qualification process by normalized prediction distribution error. Then Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) were performed. RESULTS A two-compartment model with a proportional error best fitted the data. TOB total clearance (CLTOB) was significantly correlated with Cockcroft creatinine clearance (COCK) and height. TOB clearance was 4.8 ± 1.9?l?h?1 (range 1.22?8.95), the volume of distribution of the central compartment was 24.7 ± 3.7?l (range 17.34?32.83) and that of the peripheral compartment and the inter-compartmental clearance were 30.6?l and 4.74?l?h?1, respectively. Only 29% of the patients presented a target AUC between 80 and 125?mg?l?1?h and 61% were lower than 80?mg?l?1?h. After considering COCK and height, MCS showed that only 50% of the population could achieve the target AUC for the 375 and 400?mg dosages. CONCLUSION Even after taking into account COCK and height, for strains with an MIC ≤ 1?mg?l?1, MCS doses evidenced that peak and AUC pharmacodynamic targets could not be reached simultaneously in more than 45% of the ICU patient population. Combination therapy in addition to drug monitoring are required to manage efficacy and toxicity.

AB  - Background:? The incidence of infection in patients on chronic hemodialysis in higher than that of the general population. Infection is known to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. The vascular access is important for hemodialysis, but infection through this route is the most common source of bacteremia and can be lethal to the patients. Despite the high morbidity and mortality of bacteremia in patients on chronic hemodialysis, the clinical characteristics of bacteremia in hemodialysis patients is rarely reported yet in Korea. Methods:?We included 696 hemodialysis patients from January 1993 to December 2003 at Uijongbu St. Mary's Hospital. We investigated incidence, source, causative organisms, clinical manifestations, complication, and mortality of bacteremia. We compared clinical factors, morbidity, and mortality between arteriovenous fistula and central venous catheter groups. Results:?Total 52 cases of bacteremia occurred in 43 patients. The major source of infection was vascular access (48%). Staphylococcus aureus was most common organism isolated. Major complications were septic shock (9.6%), pneumonia (9.6%), infective endocarditis (3.8%), and aortic pseudoaneurysm (1.9%). Nine patients died from septic shock (n?=?4), aspiration pneumonia (n?=?2), hypoxic brain injury (n?=?1), gastrointestinal bleeding (n?=?1), and rupture of aortic pseudoaneurysm. The central venous catheter group (n?=?22) had higher incidences of vascular access as a source of infection (81.8% vs 23.3%, p?<?0.001) and staphylococcus as a causative organism (77.2% vs 50.0%, p?=?0.042) than the arteriovenous group. Conclusion:? This data shows that bacteremia causes high incidence of fatal complications and mortality. Therefore, careful management of vascular access as well as early detection of bacteremia is an important factor for the prevention of infection and proper antibiotic therapy should be started early.

AB  - Bacteremia is a common complication for hemodialysis (HD) patients (pts) with an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC). We studied our experience with CAB and noted that CAB occurred at an average of 96?±?98 days after CVC insertion. We wondered what percentage of CAB occurred in the first 21 days after CVC insertion and the spectrum of organisms. We prospectively collected data on all HD pts from 3 centers with a CVC who developed bacteremia between 1/1/03 and 8/31/04. Pts who developed CAB with an identifiable source of bacteremia were excluded. 131 episodes of CAB were identified; 34 (25.95%) occurred in ≤21 days. The mean?±?SDEV age of the pts developing CAB?>?21 days and ≤21 days was 63?±?17 and 61.5?±?15.4 years, respectively. Table 1 outlines the spectrum of organisms. There was a significantly greater incidence of CAB with Staphylococcus aureus(SA) and a significantly lower incidence of Staphylococcus epidermidis(SE) in the pts in whom a CAB developed ≤21 days after insertion. Table 1 <21 Days >21 Days P-Value SA 20 (58.8%) 21 (21.6%) p?<?0.01 SE ?2 (5.9%) 30 (30.9%) p?<?0.05 Other GP* ?7 (20.6%) 15 (15.5%) NS GN^ ?9 (26.5%) 40 (41.2%) NS *GP: gram-positive; GN?:?gram-negative We conclude that CAB occurs in the first 21 days after CVC insertion in 25% of our CVC pts. Pts developing CAB in the first 21 days are more likely to develop CAB with SA and less likely to develop CAB with SE than pts who develop CAB after 21 days. Empiric antibiotic choice and preventative strategies need to take these data into consideration.

AB  - Background:? Both chronic HCV infection and schistosomiasis are major health problems in Egypt. The high prevalence of HCV infection in bilharzial patients had been postulated to be due to HCV transmission during past anti-bilharzial parental therapy. The aim of the work was to study the possibility of transmission of HCV through the life cycle of schistosomiasis. Subject and Methods:?The study included 180 patients divided into four groups: Group I:?Included 40 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) on regular hemodialysis (RH) with hepatic schistosmiasis (HS) and previous history of blood transfusion (BT). Group II:?Included 40 patients with CRF on RH with HS and had no previous history of BT. Group III:?Included 40 patients with CRF on RH with no evidence of HS and no previous history of BT. Group IV:?Included 60 patients with HS with normal renal function and no previous history of BT. In addition 20 healthy persons were included as a control group. In addition to the routine investigations the patient groups were subjected to HCV Ab, HBsAg, HBcAb, HBcAg, anti bilharzial Ab, abdominal ultrasonography, rectal snip for patients positive for anti bilharzial Ab, and in-situ hybridization (ISH) for HCV RNA and HBV DNA in the rectal snips positive for living schistosoma ova obtained from bilharzial patients positive for markers of HCV and HBV, respectively. Results:?HCV Ab was detected in 92.5%, 65%, 55%, and 76.7% in groups I, II, III, IV, respectively, compared to 25% in the control group. Anti-schistosomal Ab was detected in 75%, 50%, and 71.7% in groups I, II, and IV, respectively. A highly significant correlation was found between HCV Ab and anti-schistosomal Ab positivity among all bilharzial groups (P?<?0.01 in group I and P?<?0.001 in groups II & IV). Rectal snips were positive for living schistosoma ova in 76.7%, 90%, and 81.4% of anti-schistosomal Ab positive cases in groups I, II, and IV, respectively. Moreover, a highly significant correlation was found between HCV Ab and rectal snip positivity among the 3 bilharzial patients groups (P?<?0.001 in groups I & II and P?<?0.01 in group IV). On the other hand, there was no significant association between HBs Ag and either anti-schistosomal Ab positivity or rectal snip positivity. ISH revealed HCV RNA in 26.3% of schistosomal ova-positive rectal snips. In contrast, the examined biopsies were negative for hybridization of HBV DNA. Conclusion:?Schistosomiasis might play a role in the transmission of HCV through its life cycle and this also may explain the significant association between HCV and schistosomiasis.

AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects survival and morbidity of end-stage renal disease patients and also increases treatment costs. Aim of this study is to define prevalence of HCV infection in our hemodialysis (HD) units and documenting past interventions and clinical status of patients. 711 patients were included. Patient data were collected from 4 HD units of Baskent University. Patient records were examined for demograpic findings, anti-HCV, HCV RNA, liver biopsy, interferon treatment information, last 12 months? laboratory values (serum transaminases, albumin, lipid profiles, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein), and current clinical status, retrospectively. 143 patients (3%) were anti-HCV positive. These patients? alanine transferase levels (23.5?±?20.5 vs 15.5?±?12.8?U/L, p?<?0.0001) and HD duration (97.9?±?58.6 vs 46.3?±?35.6 months, p?<?0.0001) were significantly higher. No other significant difference could be identified between the groups. Analysis of HD duration of anti-HCV positive patients revealed that prevalance was increasing as the duration increased. Anti-HCV positivity was known for a mean of 60.4?±?38.8 months while 44 patients (30.7%) were already infected at initiation of HD. HCV RNA analysis was positive in 26.7% and a liver biopsy was performed in 23% of patients after 19.8?±?23.3 months following positive anti-HCV identification. Minimally active chronic hepatitis C was the most common pathological diagnosis (70, 3%). Only 18 patients (12.5%) recieved interferon therapy. None of the patients had chronic liver disease clinical and physical findings by the time this study was done. HCV infection is a common problem in HD patients that increases the need for medical interventions and treatment.

AB  - Background:? Because of high incidence of acquired renal cyst and renal malignancy, it is suggested that spontaneous renal rupture more frequently occurs in patients receiving long-term hemodialysis than in the general population. This study was performed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of spontaneous renal rupture in hemodialysis patients. Methods:?This retrospective study enrolled 12 hemodialysis patients who developed spontaneous renal rupture. We investigated primary renal disease, duration of dialysis, clinical symptoms and signs, radiologic findings, treatment modalities, and histologic findings. Result:?The mean age of the patients was 54?±?10 years old and the number of male was 9. Primary renal disease consisted of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PCKD)(n?=?5), chronic glomerulonephritis (n?=?2), diabetic nephropathy (n?=?1), hypertensive nephropathy (n?=?1), unknown cause (n?=?3). Presenting symptoms and signs were sudden onset of flank pain in 9 patients and gross hematuria with mild flank pain in 3 patients. Mean duration from initiation of hemodialysis to development of spontaneous renal rupture was 53?±?36 months. Abdominal computed tomography showed subcapsular or perinephric hematoma in all patients. Of the 7 non-PCKD patients, 6 patients had multiple acquired renal cysts. Surgical exploration was undertaken in 9 patients. Pathologic examination demonstrated small sized renal cell carcinoma in 2 of 9 patients. Three patients were only treated with conservative management including blood transfusion. All 12 patients recovered without recurrence. Conclusion:?This study demonstrated that genetic or acquired renal cyst was an important cause of spontaneous renal rupture in hemodialysis patients and presenting manifestations were sudden onset of flank pain and gross hematuria.

AB  - An increased frequency of the Milk-Alkali syndrome in the last several years has been noticed related to increasing use of calcium carbonate as a phosphate binder in CKD patients, as an antacid or as calcium supplementation. We present a case of severe hypercalcemia secondary to Milk-Alkali syndrome that precipitated acute renal failure requiring urgent hemodialysis. A 59-year-old male with history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and acid reflux presented to the ER with confusion, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. His family relayed a history of recent indigestion and relief with Tums. He was taking several tablets at short intervals to self-treat the indigestion. At the time of presentation, patient was confused and noted to be dehydrated. Lab findings were significant for elevated BUN/Cr- 121?mg/dl/11.1?mg/dl (baseline Cr 1.1?mg/dl few months ago), bicarbonate 38?mg/dl, calcium 16.7?mg/dl, ionized Ca of 1.76?mmol/L, iPTH 10?pg/ml, PTHrP 0.7?pg/ml. Medical management with intravenous fluids and furosemide showed no improvement in renal failure, or calcium level. Patient was then started on hemodialysis with 2.0?mmol/L calcium in the dialysate the next day. There was gradual improvement in patient's mental status, calcium values, and renal failure over the ensuing 2 weeks. Discussion and Conclusions:? The diagnosis of Milk-Alkali syndrome is made on the basis of history. Metabolic abnormalities involved in this syndrome are hypercalcemia with low to normal PTH and Vit. D levels, renal failure, and metabolic alkalosis. Failed medical management required acute dialysis in this patient. Acute hemodialysis in such a case could be life saving. Due to increasing use of calcium carbonate for dyspepsia and osteoporosis, patients should be made aware of these severe, potentially life-threatening adverse effects.

AB  - Forty-one consecutive admissions to a hemodialysis center were evaluated. Demographic information including age, gender, race, and diagnosis was collected. Patients, >18 years old, with end stage renal disease and on hemodialysis for at least one year were included. Those with edema or known ascites were excluded. Weight was measured before and after hemodialysis (HD) using a standard scale and by considering the amount of fluid loss by the hemodialysis machine. Body composition including total body water (TBW) was calculated before and after HD using near infrared interactance (NIR). All measurements were completed during half hour before and after HD. Forty-one patients included: men (n?=?26), women (n?=?15); median age 58 (range 28?88 years). Twenty-eight were African American and the rest Caucasians. The amount of intravascular fluid taken after HD (assessed by weight reduction) ranged 0?5?L with median 2.2?L. NIR analysis for the same patients at the same time showed different total body water measurements in 91% of cases (P?>?0.05). Moreover, NIR analysis showed increase in total body water in 24% of patients even though the hemodialysis machine showed a loss of total body water; median of 1.3 (range: 0?3L). The error in measuring body composition with NIR was both large and varied (random and not systematic error). We conclude that NIR analysis cannot be considered as a reliable method to evaluate body composition, especially total body water, amongst patients with end stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis.

AB  - Purpose:? To evaluate efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in non-maturing Brescia-Cimino fistulas. Methods:?Between January 1997 and December 2003, we treated 22 patients with non-maturing Brescia-Cimino fistulas by PTA. Retrospective analysis was performed on the findings of fistulogram, techniques and success rate of PTA, and patency rate. Results:?Seventeen segmental stenoses and 5 segmental occlusions of cephalic veins were identified. Sixteen stenoses and 2 occlusions were located at the cephalic vein adjacent to the anastomosis site, and 3 occlusions and 1 stenosis were seen at the proximal vein near the elbow joint. In addition to venous stenosis, a focal arterial stenosis at the anastomosis site and two accompanying accessory veins that might hamper maturation of main cephalic vein was seen in each of two patients, respectively. Simultaneous occlusion of left innominate vein as well as occlusion of cephalic vein were noted in one patient. Initial success rate of PTA was 95.5%(21/22). Overall success rate including 11 additional PTAs performed during follow-up was 96.9%(32/33). No major complication occurred. Primary and secondary patency rates were 72% and 95% at 3 months, and 50% and 77% at 6 months, respectively. Conclusion:?PTA is an effective and safe method in salvaging non-maturing Brescia-Cimino fistulas.

AB  - Objective: To describe the use of argatroban in a post-cardiac operation patient with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia requiring hemodialysis and continuous veno-veno hemodialysis (CVVH). Case Summary:A 23-year-old Caucasian female with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia developed acute renal failure after cardiovascular surgery. Argatroban was used as a substitute for heparin during hemodialysis and CVVH. Both activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and activated clotting time (ACT) were used to guide the dosage of argatroban. The patient was successfully dialyzed without clotting of the circuit. The dosage required in our patient was much lower than the manufacturer's recommendation. Discussion:Argatroban is a thrombin inhibitor that does not cross react with heparin. It is metabolized by the liver, and dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The correct dosage for patient with unstable hemodynamics is not known. Our patient had apparently normal hepatic function at the initiation of dialysis, but the dosage of argatroban recommended by the manufacturer resulted in prolonged elevation of the aPTT and ACT with associated gastrointestinal bleeding. This may be related to hepatic congestion secondary to poor cardiac function and/or severe anasarca. And the dosage of argatroban required during dialysis was much lower than the recommendation. Conclusions:Argatroban is an effective alternative of heparin for CVVH. The correct initial dosage in patients with mild hepatic impairment and unstable hemodynamics is still unclear.

AB  - Several types of high flux dialyzers were developed and introduced for clinical applications to improve solute removal efficiency. In these dialyzers, internal filtration/backfiltration (IF/BF) is induced by pressure drop of blood and dialysate flow in a countercurrent manner under less net filtration. Higher IF/BF flow rate increased convective transport of the solute in addition to diffusive transport. In previously published papers, we reported the effects of IF on solute removal efficiency of the dialyzer during an analytical and an experimental study and the measurement of the internal filtration flow rate (QIF) by Doppler ultrasonography. Average blood flow rate (QBav) at a cross-sectional plane was measured by pulse Doppler and the longitudinal QBav profile along the dialyzer was obtained using a probe slider that can move the probe in parallel along the dialyzer. This is a suitable method for a bedside monitoring of the IF/BF flow rate of dialyzers because it is noninvasive to the patient and produces reliable data with higher reproducibility. Internal backfiltration flow rate (QBF) in six types of commercially available high flux dialyzers, having a higher 50?ml/min of ?2-microglobulin clearance (CL-?2?m), were examined by Doppler ultrasonography under 10?ml/min/m2 of net filtration flow rate. As a result, a wide range of QBF value, 12.1?28.4?ml/min, was obtained among those dialyzers. It means a fair amount of BF, 2.9?6.8 liter per session, occurs in a typical hemodialysis treatment. Strict management of dialysate purification is required for a dialyzer with a relatively larger BF. On the other hand, no correlation between the CL-?2?m value and the QBF value was seen because the CL-?2?m value depends on not only the IF/BF flow rate but also diffusive property of the membrane. The BF flow rate in every dialyzer should be examined to avoid suffering from the invasion of endotoxin and its fragment for safety.

AB  - This study was designed to investigate the possible effect of dialyzer re-use on glucose hemostasis. Twenty patients with end stage renal failure (including ten non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus [NIDDM]) on thrice weekly hemodialysis (using glucose free dialysate), were studied by serial assessment of blood glucose, C-peptide, interleukin 1-B (IL-IB), Ca, Na and K at zero, 1 and 4 hours (end of dialysis) during hemodialysis on new, and then on re-used (first) cuprophane dialyzers. Our results showed significant rise of C-peptide, IL-1B with drop of blood glucose in first hour sample (and was symptomatic in some diabetics) in both groups when using new dialyzers but these changes were less marked and totally asymptomatic when using reprocessed dialyzers. In addition there was a significant positive correlation between IL-1B level and C-peptide at 1 and 4 hour samples and negative correlation between IL-1B and blood glucose at 1 and 4 hour samples. Conclusion: Through the effect of IL-1B on insulin release curophane dialyzers can affect glucose homeostasis especially in diabetics and hypoglycemia might be part of the first use syndrome. It may be recommended that measurement of glucose effect of dialysis membrane on glucose homeostasis might be an important parameter of membrane bioincompatibility.

AB  - Quaternary-ammonium-compounds are potent cationic antimicrobials used in everyday consumer products. Surface-immobilized, quaternary-ammonium-compounds create an antimicrobial contact-killing coating. We describe the preparation of a shape-adaptive, contact-killing coating by tethering quaternary-ammonium-compounds onto hyperbranched polyurea coatings, able to kill adhering bacteria by partially enveloping them. Even after extensive washing, coatings caused high contact-killing of Staphylococcus epidermidis, both in culture-based assays and through confocal-laser-scanning-microscopic examination of the membrane-damage of adhering bacteria. In culture-based assays, at a challenge of 1600 CFU/cm2, contact-killing was >99.99%. The working-mechanism of dissolved quaternary-ammonium-compounds is based on their interdigitation in bacterial membranes, but it is difficult to envisage how immobilized quaternary-ammonium-molecules can exert such a mechanism of action. Staphylococcal adhesion forces to hyperbranched quaternary-ammonium coatings were extremely high, indicating that quaternary-ammonium-molecules on hyperbranched polyurea partially envelope adhering bacteria upon contact. These lethally strong adhesion forces upon adhering bacteria then cause removal of membrane lipids and eventually lead to bacterial death.
