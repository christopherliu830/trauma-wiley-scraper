AB  - Objective: To describe the use of argatroban in a post-cardiac operation patient with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia requiring hemodialysis and continuous veno-veno hemodialysis (CVVH). Case Summary:A 23-year-old Caucasian female with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia developed acute renal failure after cardiovascular surgery. Argatroban was used as a substitute for heparin during hemodialysis and CVVH. Both activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and activated clotting time (ACT) were used to guide the dosage of argatroban. The patient was successfully dialyzed without clotting of the circuit. The dosage required in our patient was much lower than the manufacturer's recommendation. Discussion:Argatroban is a thrombin inhibitor that does not cross react with heparin. It is metabolized by the liver, and dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The correct dosage for patient with unstable hemodynamics is not known. Our patient had apparently normal hepatic function at the initiation of dialysis, but the dosage of argatroban recommended by the manufacturer resulted in prolonged elevation of the aPTT and ACT with associated gastrointestinal bleeding. This may be related to hepatic congestion secondary to poor cardiac function and/or severe anasarca. And the dosage of argatroban required during dialysis was much lower than the recommendation. Conclusions:Argatroban is an effective alternative of heparin for CVVH. The correct initial dosage in patients with mild hepatic impairment and unstable hemodynamics is still unclear.

AB  - Several types of high flux dialyzers were developed and introduced for clinical applications to improve solute removal efficiency. In these dialyzers, internal filtration/backfiltration (IF/BF) is induced by pressure drop of blood and dialysate flow in a countercurrent manner under less net filtration. Higher IF/BF flow rate increased convective transport of the solute in addition to diffusive transport. In previously published papers, we reported the effects of IF on solute removal efficiency of the dialyzer during an analytical and an experimental study and the measurement of the internal filtration flow rate (QIF) by Doppler ultrasonography. Average blood flow rate (QBav) at a cross-sectional plane was measured by pulse Doppler and the longitudinal QBav profile along the dialyzer was obtained using a probe slider that can move the probe in parallel along the dialyzer. This is a suitable method for a bedside monitoring of the IF/BF flow rate of dialyzers because it is noninvasive to the patient and produces reliable data with higher reproducibility. Internal backfiltration flow rate (QBF) in six types of commercially available high flux dialyzers, having a higher 50?ml/min of ?2-microglobulin clearance (CL-?2?m), were examined by Doppler ultrasonography under 10?ml/min/m2 of net filtration flow rate. As a result, a wide range of QBF value, 12.1?28.4?ml/min, was obtained among those dialyzers. It means a fair amount of BF, 2.9?6.8 liter per session, occurs in a typical hemodialysis treatment. Strict management of dialysate purification is required for a dialyzer with a relatively larger BF. On the other hand, no correlation between the CL-?2?m value and the QBF value was seen because the CL-?2?m value depends on not only the IF/BF flow rate but also diffusive property of the membrane. The BF flow rate in every dialyzer should be examined to avoid suffering from the invasion of endotoxin and its fragment for safety.

AB  - This study was designed to investigate the possible effect of dialyzer re-use on glucose hemostasis. Twenty patients with end stage renal failure (including ten non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus [NIDDM]) on thrice weekly hemodialysis (using glucose free dialysate), were studied by serial assessment of blood glucose, C-peptide, interleukin 1-B (IL-IB), Ca, Na and K at zero, 1 and 4 hours (end of dialysis) during hemodialysis on new, and then on re-used (first) cuprophane dialyzers. Our results showed significant rise of C-peptide, IL-1B with drop of blood glucose in first hour sample (and was symptomatic in some diabetics) in both groups when using new dialyzers but these changes were less marked and totally asymptomatic when using reprocessed dialyzers. In addition there was a significant positive correlation between IL-1B level and C-peptide at 1 and 4 hour samples and negative correlation between IL-1B and blood glucose at 1 and 4 hour samples. Conclusion: Through the effect of IL-1B on insulin release curophane dialyzers can affect glucose homeostasis especially in diabetics and hypoglycemia might be part of the first use syndrome. It may be recommended that measurement of glucose effect of dialysis membrane on glucose homeostasis might be an important parameter of membrane bioincompatibility.

AB  - Summary:? The interaction between pathogenic microorganisms and their hosts is regulated by reciprocal survival strategies, including competition for essential nutrients. Though paradoxical, mammalian hosts have learned to take advantage of amino acid catabolism for controlling pathogen invasion and, at the same time, regulating their own immune responses. In this way, ancient catabolic enzymes have acquired novel functions and evolved into new structures with highly specialized functions, which go beyond the struggle for survival. In this review, we analyze the evidence supporting a critical role for the metabolism of various amino acids in regulating different steps of both innate and adaptive immunity.
