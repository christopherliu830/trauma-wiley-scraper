AB  - ABSTRACT Aim Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most serious complications seen in intensive care units (ICUs). However, its epidemiology, risk factors and clinical outcomes in surgical critically ill patients remains unclear. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted in surgical intensive care unit (ICU) of the university hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. AKI was diagnosed according to the KDIGO 2012 criteria. Results A total of 189 of the 400 patients enrolled in our study developed AKI (47.3%). The severity was: stage 1 = 29.6% of all AKI (56 cases), stage 2 = 30.7% (58 cases), and stage 3 = 39.7% (75 cases). Risk factors of AKI development included a higher BMI, a greater APACHE-II score, septic shock, use of mechanical ventilation, acute medical complications during surgical admission, and pre-existing chronic kidney disease. After adjustment for covariates, only the most severe stage of AKI (stage 3) was associated with increasing 28-day ICU mortality compared with no AKI stage, HR = 7.75 (95% CI, 1.46?41.20, P = 0.02). Conclusion Acute kidney injury is common and is associated with an increase in mortality in surgical ICU patients. There should be more focus on patients with AKI risk factors to prevent this deleterious event.

AB  - Abstract Objective: To describe a multidisciplinary primary healthcare clinic for newly arrived humanitarian entrants in regional New South Wales and report health problems and issues encountered during the initial period of operation. Methods: A quality assurance study of the Coffs Harbour Refugee Health Clinic (a collaboration between the Area Health Service and general practitioners) was undertaken from February to December 2006. Results: Seventy-six patients received a comprehensive health assessment: 69 of these within 12 months of arrival. The median time from arrival in Australia to the first clinic visit was five days. Problems detected were categorised according to their management options. GP clinic providers expressed concern about referring patients to GPs in the community for ongoing care. Conclusions: The Coffs Harbour Refugee Health Clinic represents a successful collaboration between relevant stakeholders. It was well utilised by the target community. Implications: The service delivery model used in the clinic could be replicated in other areas in regional Australia, provided financial and human resources are available.

AB  - We gathered information on the cost-effectiveness of life-saving interventions in the United States from publicly available economic analyses. ?Life-saving interventions? were defined as any behavioral and/or technological strategy that reduces the probability of premature death among a specified target population. We defined cost-effectiveness as the net resource costs of an intervention per year of life saved. To improve the comparability of cost-effectiveness ratios arrived at with diverse methods, we established fixed definitional goals and revised published estimates, when necessary and feasible, to meet these goals. The 587 interventions identified ranged from those that save more resources than they cost, to those costing more than 10 billion dollars per year of life saved. Overall, the median intervention costs $42,000 per life-year saved. The median medical intervention costs $19,000/life-year; injury reduction $48,000/life-year; and toxin control $2,800,000/life-year. Cost/life-year ratios and bibliographic references for more than 500 life-saving interventions are provided.

AB  - Summary A variety of diseases can affect the kidneys leading to a sudden deterioration in renal function (acute kidney injury) or an irreversible deterioration of renal function (chronic kidney disease). The selection of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in acutely ill children depends upon the availability of treatment modalities and ventilatory support, the patient's requirements for fluid and solute removal and haemodynamic stability. Cardiovascular abnormalities develop early in the course of CKD and progress as end stage is reached. Protein energy wasting (PEW) is characterised by the state of decreased body protein mass and fuel reserves. Carnitine is an amino acid derivative which has a key role in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) formation. Congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) is a rare inherited kidney disorder. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare genetic disorder characterised by the kidney failing to respond to arginine vasopressin, the antidiuretic hormone (ADH).
