AB  - Pigs have been accepted as good models for skin wound healing research due to their anatomical similarities to humans. The healing response of excisional wounds in juvenile female Yorkshire (Y) pigs closely resembles normal healing in humans. In contrast, identical wounds in female red Duroc (RD) pigs contracted significantly more, resulting in an 80?90% reduction in wound area. This hypercontraction was associated with marked hyperpigmentation at the wound margins, and some features of the RD healing phenotype, such as increased collagen deposition, are similar to hypertrophic scar formation in humans. Recent investigations have begun to elucidate the genetic transmissibility of the RD healing phenotype. Skin wounds were created on Y???RD F1 female animals (N?=?8), and while hyperpigmentation was not observed, the hypercontraction prevalent in the RD persisted in 100% of animals studied. Further, the degree and kinetics of contraction observed in the F1 animals was significantly greater than in the RD. All F1 animals were subsequently bred to a single Yorkshire boar, producing a cohort of 20 female backcross animals. Healing in the backcross animals generally followed the Y phenotype with regard to wound contraction and pigmentation. However, between days 28 and 56, the backcross animals demonstrated significantly less contraction than the Yorkshire animals. These results suggest that the regulation of wound contraction is controlled by a restricted number of major genes and an unidentified number of other genes, which may positively or negatively modulate the influence of the major genes, as observed in the F1 and backcross animals. These studies have begun the process of elucidating the molecular basis for abnormal skin wound healing and scarring. Further ongoing studies are using genomic and proteomic approaches to further elucidate candidate genes potentially involved in the RD healing phenotype. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Introduction:? Using peptide growth factors to improve upon natural wound healing provides promise, but topical application of growth factors has found limited clinical success. Gene therapy has been limited by low transfection efficiency. We are investigating the use of electroporation (EP)in vivo to enhance transfection efficiency and improve wound healing with DNA expression vectors for growth factors. Methods:? To assess plasmid transfection and wound healing, gWIZ luciferase vector and PCDNA3.1/KGF expression vector were used, respectively. Cutaneous wounds were produced via 8?mm-punch biopsy in Sprague Dawley rats. Healing was impaired by cecal ligation induced sepsis. We used NIH image analysis software and histologic assessment to assess wound closure. Results:? Plasmid Transfection: EP effectively increased expression of gWIZ luciferase vector 53-fold compared to vector without EP (p?<?0.001). We demonstrated that transfection was localized to skin when transfected skin was reflected to reveal underlying muscle. We found that EP-assisted transfection lasted for 30 days, which is appropriate for treatment of wound healing. Wound Healing:? Using PCDNA3.1/KGF expression vector and EP wounds were 60% smaller on day 12 versus vector without EP (p?<?0.009). We assessed quality of healing with a histologic scoring system grading quality of epithelial coverage, organization of scar and resolution of inflammation. KGF vector?+?EP score of 3.0 +/? 0.3 was better than that of 1.8 +/? 0.3 for treatment with vector alone (p?<?0.05). Conclusions:? These results demonstrate the capacity of electroporation-facilitated transfection with DNA plasmid expression vector for growth factor to improve wound healing. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) and its murine homolog spi2 are serine protease inhibitors present in plasma, that are locally up-regulated during wound healing. Ad-spi2 and Ad-ACT expression vectors were constructed to address the biological activity of locally expressed serpins. The condition medium of infected COS-1 cell at 2?d postinfection contained 1.23?ng/ml spi2 and 2.61?ng/ml ACT. Ad-LacZ or Ad-spi2 108?pfu was injected into the sponges after 3?d subcutaneous implantation in rats. Histological analysis showed that overexpression of spi2 improves granulation tissue organization and collagen deposition at d7 implantation. Moreover, overexpression of spi2 increases the contents of tissue DNA (23.8%, p?<?0.05) and protein (25.3%, p?<?0.05) in sponge implantation model in rats. In incisional wound models in both normal and STZ-induced diabetic rats, Ad-spi2 increases tensile strength by 26%(p?=?0.011) and 29%(p?=?0.022) as well as Ad-ACT increases by 10.3%(p?=?0.037) and 32%(p?=?0.004), respectively. In adriamycin-induced wound model in rats, histological analysis displayed less inflammatory cells infiltrating in Ad-ACT injected wound than in Ad-LacZ after 21?d injection of adriamycin. Inflammation enzymes MPO and elastase levels were decreased by 32.3% and 29.2% in Ad-ACT injected wound tissue. Our data concluded that overexpression of spi2 and ACT improves wound healing in rats probably via inflammatory resolution. (Supported by Switch Biotech and the Department of Veterans Affairs)

AB  - The diabetic wound is characterized by abnormal, prolonged inflammatory activity and impaired healing. Enhanced interaction between the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and its ligands in the diabetic tissue environment has been shown to increase proinflammatory cytokines and tissue-degradative matrix metalloproteinases, resulting in decreased collagen generation. Blockade of RAGE with multiple topical applications of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) on diabetic wounds has been shown to accelerate diabetic wound closure. We investigated the potential efficacy of gene therapy as a method for enhancing sRAGE expression in the diabetic wound. Full thickness 2???2?cm2 excisional wounds were created on the dorsae of genetically diabetic db/db mice. Lentiviral vector (1???105?PFU in 1?ml saline) carrying the gene for soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (lenti-sRAGE) was injected into the wound margins and base. Mice were sacrificed at 14-, 21-, and 35-day intervals. Measurement of the residual epithelial gap showed increased healing of lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds compared to wounds treated with saline injection alone. Lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds were significantly smaller (epithelial gap?±?SD) than saline-treated wounds at both 21 days (0.77?±?0.24?cm, compared to 1.13?±?0.30?cm; P?<?0.05) and 35 days (0.51?±?0.42?cm, compared to 0.86?±?0.35?cm; P?<?0.05). Picrosirius red staining showed that lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds had 2.23?±?0.35 and 13.26?±?6.25-fold increases in collagen content relative to saline-treated wounds at 21 and 35 days, respectively (P?<?0.05). Preliminary CD31 staining of 21-day wounds demonstrated a twofold increase in neovascularization in lenti-sRAGE-treated wounds versus saline-treated wounds. Lentiviral gene therapy with sRAGE can accelerate diabetic wound healing over time, and genetic modification of the diabetic tissue environment to restore normal inflammatory activity could have a central role in the clinical setting.

AB  - Tissue ischemia is a common occurrence in many disease processes including chronic wounds, stroke, solid tumors, and myocardial infarction. The application of gene delivery for healing of wounds has demonstrated increasing therapeutic promises in animal models. Adenoviral vectors have been successfully used for gene delivery to the ischemic wound. However, these vectors typically demonstrate short, transient transgene expression while eliciting significant cytotoxic immune response. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) do not have those limitations; however, scant information is available about their transfection efficiency under low-oxygen tension. The goal of this study was to compare AAV vector with adenoviral vector in terms of relative efficiency of gene delivery and cytotoxic immune response in ischemic wounds. Reporter constructs Ad5-LacZ and AAV-LacZ (108?pfu/wound) were injected onto the dermis of rabbit ear prior to creation of ischemic wounds. Wounds were harvested at postoperative day 10. Frozen sections of the wounds were fixed in cold acetone and stained with an in situ ?-gal staining kit. Intense expression of ?-gal was observed with both vectors; however, transduction rates with AAV vector was approximately 10-fold lower than Adenovirus. Unlike Adenovirus, no noticeable inflammatory cell infiltration was observed with AAV injection. Even when the dosage of AAV was increased to 109?pfu/wound inflammatory cell infiltration remained negligible. Thus our data indicates that both AAV and adenoviral vectors are suitable to use in gene-therapy experiments in ischemic tissues. The particular advantage of AAV is the ability to transfect with higher doses while at lower dose maximal transfection rate seems to be more with Adenovirus.

AB  - Introduction:? Diabetes is known to impair wound healing. We assessed the effect of aging on this impairment and further explored the possibility of repairing age-dependant impairment by replenishing levels of the growth factor KGF-1 using our system of electroporation enhanced gene therapy. Methods:? Female BKS.Cg-m+/+Leprdb/J mice (diabetic) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice at time of study were 7, 27, and 84 weeks, respectively. Two wounds were created using a 5?mm punch biopsy. Plasmid DNA encoding KGF-1 was injected at 40??g / wound. Electroporation was carried out with six square wave pulses, at 1800 volts for 100??s; with aninterval of 125?ms. Wounds were assessed planometrically over a 14-day period. Results:? We found that wound healing is severely impaired in older, but not young diabetic mice (7-week-old mice displayed a threefold smaller wound area than 84-week-old mice on day 9). Glucose levels were similar in old and young groups ruling out differences in intensity of the metabolic derangement to explain this disparity (old: 334 +/? 41?mg/dl vs. young: 290 +/? 33?mg/dl). Treatment with KGF-1 gene therapy increased wound closure in aged mice 5.9-fold as compared to untreated aged mice 5 days after wounding (treated: 3724 +/? 631 vs. untreated: 632 +/? 517, P?=?0.002). Aged KGF-1 gene therapy-treated mice closed wounds 10-fold faster than treated young mice 5 days after wounding (old: 3724: +/? 631 vs. young 358 +/? 871, P?=?0.004). Conclusions:? We conclude that progressive damage to the tissues capability to heal occurs in individuals with diabetes. Treatment with KGF-1 gene therapy is more effective in aged mice than young mice. With an increasing geriatric diabetic population, gene therapy to replenish growth factors may be worth exploring.

AB  - Bioactive, resorbable materials can be useful in the treatment of surgical injury where biomaterial incorporation followed by tissue-specific remodeling is desired. Bioactive growth factors may be useful in the treatment of chronic ulcerative wounds, shifting the static wound environment to a more active acute phase. Small intestinal submucosa (SIS) is a naturally occurring extracellular matrix used as a biomaterial for the treatment of soft tissue injury, as well as pressure, venous, and diabetic ulcers. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that SIS induces host tissue infiltration, site-specific remodeling, and repair. Although SIS consists primarily of collagen, the presence of other proteins, glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and the growth factors FGF-2, VEGF, and TGF-? have been reported. Recent experiments have demonstrated the presence of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in SIS. Immunohistochemical staining for CTGF was positive in mechanically isolated, disinfected, and ethylene oxide (EO) sterilized SIS. Lyophilized SIS samples were ground in ice cold PBS and CTGF concentration was measured using ELISA. The results are summarized in the following table: Sample [CTGF](ng/g) Mechanically isolated SIS 39.88?±?5.4 Disinfected SIS 11.31?±?7.2 Ethylene oxide sterilized SIS ?7.96?±?1.3 CTGF, secreted by fibroblasts after activation with TGF-?, stimulates cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis.

AB  - Wound repair is described as a delicately balanced and well-orchestrated progression of events, which ultimately results in healing in the majority of acute cases. However, time taken to complete healing can vary greatly between patients and any alteration in this physiological process could delay healing further. Thus, a wound treatment, which facilitates healing independent of wound type and in patients where healing is compromised or impeded, would be extremely advantageous. Previous studies suggest a beneficial role for biomaterials such as collagen/ORC in modifying the chronic wound environment; however, their effect on the acute wound environment is unknown. While it is generally accepted that acute wounds heal at an optimum rate due to a positive wound environment, we wanted to determine if current advanced wound healing treatments could augment or impact this healing rate. In this study we evaluated the effect of advanced wound therapies in the presence of acute wound fluid on human dermal fibroblast proliferation. We hypothesize that an enhanced effect on fibroblast proliferation in the presence of acute wound fluid may be indicative of a beneficial effect in the treatment of acute wounds. Results demonstrate that of the wound treatments tested only collagen/ORC containing therapies exhibited a positive effect on fibroblast proliferation in the presence of acute wound fluid. We conclude, therefore, that collagen/ORC biomaterials, already shown to be beneficial in the treatment of chronic wounds, may also be a valuable therapy in the treatment of acute wounds.

AB  - Expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), a serine protease inhibitor important in the control of cell-to-matrix adhesion is spatially regulated following epidermal injury. PAI-1 synthesis was induced early after monolayer wounding and restricted to keratinocytes comprising the motile cohort closely recapitulating, thereby, similar events during cutaneous healing. MEK blockade with PD98059 or U0126 attenuated keratinocyte migration by ≥60%, as did transient transfection of a dominant-negative ERK1 construct, and completely inhibited PAI-1 transcript expression. Antisense downregulation of PAI-1 synthesis (by 80?85%) inhibited injury site closure. Keratinocytes isolated from PAI-1?/? mice confirmed the antisense results. PAI-1?/? cells had a 'significant wound healing defect; addition of active PAI-1 protein rescued the migratory phenotype. An E box (5?-CACGTG-3?) in the PE2 region of the PAI-1 gene was required for transcription of a PAI-1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter. Mutation of the CACGTG hexanucleotide to CAATTG inhibited 'promoter function. Competing CACGTG-containing DNAs, regardless of the presence or absence of PAI-1 specific flanking sequences or lacking accessory sequences inhibited complex formation between nuclear factors and a PE2 region probe. A CG?AT substitution with random (i.e., non-PAI-1) flanking sequences also failed to compete with the PE2 region probe for protein binding whereas the same construct with an intact CACGTG motif was an effective competitor. The major protein/DNA interactions in the PE2 segment, therefore, are E-box dependent. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that this site was occupied by USF-1 or a USF-1-containing complex. Transfection of a dominant-negative USF construct effectively attenuated growth factor-induced PAI-1 synthesis. Dominant-negative USF-expressing keratinocytes, moreover, had a significantly reduced capacity for Matrigel barrier invasion. USF elements, therefore, are important regulators of PAI-1 transcription and the associated migratory response. (Supported by NIH Grants GM57242 and GM42461)

AB  - Introduction:? There is growing clinical evidence that moist wounds show improved wound healing in terms of less scar tissue formation and better cosmesis. Increased levels of wound fluid improve migration of keratinocytes along the wound surface. Occlusive dressings provide such a hydrated wound environment. However, the underlying mechanisms on how occluded wounds exert the clinical observed effect are yet barely understood. We hypothesized, that keratinocytes play a keyrole in hydrated wounds by sending cytokine signals to upper epidermal layers and even more important to the dermis. We therefore focused on connexins, intercellular channels that are strongly involved in cell-cell communication, hemostasis, and small molecule exchange. Methods:? Full thickness incisions to the panniculus carnosus were made on female Fisher rats. Both incisions were closed in a subcuticular fashion using 5-0 polypropylene suture. One incision on each rat was randomly covered with an occlusive dressing until harvest. Wounds were harvested on PODs 3, 7, and 10. RNA was selectively extracted from both the epidermis and dermis. Histo'logy slides were preliminary evaluated by using a 0?4 scale rating cellularity count in the epithelium, subepithelium, and peripanniculous as well as epithelial thickness. Results:? Cellularity count was significantly reduced in the epithelial and subepithelial compartment of occluded wounds as well as the epithelial thickness in occluded wounds (p?<?0,05). QRT-PCR analysis revealed a significant up-regulation of Cx30-mRNA on POD10 in occluded wounds versus nonoccluded wounds. Conclusion:? Our results suggest that occlusion promotes epithelialization and maturation of incisional wounds most likely through hydration. Up-regulation of Connexin30 on POD10 supports that thesis, as it suggests an advanced communication process in keratinocytes in occluded wounds.

AB  - Laser therapy has been considered useful for the treatment of chronic wounds. Different research groups have been working with fibroblastic metabolism, after culture irradiation with red and infrared sources of laser. Previously it has been demonstrated that lasers stimulate collagen synthesis and [3H]tymidine uptake when fibroblasts are irradiated and grown in the presence of fetal bovine serum (5?10%). Our group has been evaluating the in vitro effects of low-level laser (??=?650?nm) activity on fibroblast metabolism. In this work, fibroblast activity was evaluated after 24, 48, and 72?h from G0 using synchronized fibroblast cultures previously irradiated with a single dose of low-level laser at different power densities (3.75, 7.5, 15, and 30?mW/cm2), during different times of exposure (15, 30, 60, and 120?sec). Proliferation was measured by [3H]tymidine uptake, and ProMMP-1 and TIMP-1 were evaluated by ELISA. Significant changes in proliferation were only observed after 48?h when 'cultures were irradiated during 30?sec with 3.75, 7.5, and 15?mW/cm2, or during 60 seconds at 15?mW/cm2. However, ProMMP-1 diminished significantly after 24 and 48?h when cultures were irradiated with 7.5 and 15?mW/cm2 during 30 and 60?sec, and with 7.5 and 15?mW/cm2 during 15 seconds, after 48?h. TIMP-1 expression was significantly lower than the control during each dose and they were assayed 24?h after each irradiation. Based on the above data, fibroblast proliferation is stimulated 48?h after irradiation, using low-level laser to incorporate cells from G0 to the cell cycle, almost in the absence of serum (1%), although ProMMP-1 and TIMP-1 responses were observed 24?h after irradiation with the same doses. These results indicate that low-level laser can stimulate normal human fibroblasts to reduce collagen turnover, and consequently can be useful to stimulate normal fibroblast activity in a wound. As a result, this therapy could be administered every 2 days and may be more effective.

AB  - Percutaneous devices play a central role in modern medicine, but are associated with significant risk of infection. One approach to circumvent this risk is to heal the wound around the device by creating a seal at the skin/device interface. We previously showed, using cell adhesion assay and organ culture model, that surface modification of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)[poly(HEMA)] with 1,1?-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) dramatically enhanced keratinocyte attachment to poly(HEMA). Although the organ culture model addresses epithelial response to an implanted biomaterial, to fully evaluate the cutaneous interaction with biomaterials, we tested implants in a mouse model. Porous poly(HEMA) rods with 40??m pore size were implanted into two different sites on dorsal skin of forty eight, 6?8 week old male C57BL/10?J mice. Porous poly(HEMA) rods were treated with 1) PBS, 2) CDI, and 3) CDI plus laminin 5. Samples were harvested at 7, 14, and 28 days after surgery and analyzed morphologically using H&E and immunohistochemistry. Implanted rods remained intact and infection free at all time points. Morphological analysis showed diffuse dermal cellular infiltration in all samples and evidence of epidermal integration into the pores of CDI treated poly(HEMA) and CDI plus laminin 5 treated poly(HEMA). Immunohistochemistry showed laminin 5 expression at the skin/poly(HEMA) interface resembling the junctional epithelium of the tooth. Engineering this type of attachment to percutaneous devices is attractive since the tooth is a natural example of percutaneous material, where bacterial invasion of bone is prevented by epithelial attachment.

AB  - An essential cell behavior for wound healing is the ability of reparative cells to migrate into a wound site. Impairment of this migratory behavior could delay or potentially halt the healing process, allowing for infection or other secondary insults to the wound. Type I diabetics experience significant morbidity from failure of lower extremity injuries to heal. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain this impaired healing response, but little is known about intrinsic migratory differences in the fibroblasts that populate the diabetic dermis prior to wounding. Nontransformed fibroblast cell lines from type I diabetics were obtained from the NIGMS-NIH cell repository at the Coriell Institute. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco?s modified Eagle?s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and either 25?mM (high) or 5.6?mM (low) glucose. Cell migration was measured over 72?hr by two methods; the monolayer scrape method, or by quantifying the movement of cells away from a circular source of cells, deposited within cloning rings, under high- or low-glucose conditions. The initial (0, 6, 24, and 48?hr) proliferative response of cells was measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation into confluent cell monolayers following partial scraping of the cell layer. Using the scrape method, diabetic cells failed to start moving across a monolayer scrape until?>?10?hrs, whereas normal fibroblasts had started migrating at 8?hrs and were noticeably closing the scrape ?wound? by 10 hours. Consistent with this finding, fibroblasts from diabetics showed impaired migration (70% vs. 145% increase in diameter) in high glucose over an initial 72?hrs in the second migration assay. This difference was less if the cells were cultured and tested in low glucose medium. In contrast, diabetic derived cells incorporated 3H-thymidine more rapidly at early times (55.9%[24?hr] and 72%[48?hr]) when cultured under high-glucose conditions. These results suggest that fibroblasts in the type I diabetic are characterized by a reduced capacity to migrate, but a normal or heightened proliferative capacity. This may indicate that injury to this connective tissue fails to produce the required influx of fibroblasts to deposit new matrix.

AB  - A novel biopolymer composed of porcine gelatin and dextran was used in a randomized controlled pilot clinical trial to treat diabetic foot ulcers to establish safety profile and evaluate effect on wound closure. Fifty-six patients were prospectively randomized at 10 centers (control?=?25; E-Matrix?=?31). Control patients received routine sharp debridement, off-loading, and hydrogel dressings applied daily. E-Matrix patients received identical wound care with the addition of monthly subcutaneous injections of E-Matrix under the wound surface. Patients were monitored for 12 weeks using wound planimetry and photography. Primary endpoint was safety as measured by adverse event reporting and clinical laboratory analysis. Secondary endpoint was wound closure based on intent to treat. There was no significant difference in the rate of adverse events between treated and control subjects. Overall closure rate for E-Matrix treated wounds was 42%(13 of 31 subjects) compared to 32%(8 of 25 subjects) for controls. Subgroup analysis suggested that E-Matrix may be more effective than control for treatment of larger (>2?cm2) and older (>17 weeks duration) wounds (see table). Parameter Treatment Group N Closed %Closed Size >2?cm E-Matrix 17 8 47% Control 14 4 29% Ulcer duration >17 weeks E-Matrix 15 6 40% Control 15 3 20% Although the study is insufficiently powered to evaluate statistical significance, E-Matrix demonstrated a similar safety profile to control treatment with trends toward improved healing in larger and older wounds. Further randomized trials are necessary to confirm these promising initial results.

AB  - The MRL mouse is the only known strain of mouse that can regenerate cardiac lesions and completely heal ear punches without scarring. To determine if the MRL also has greater regeneration capabilities in amputated digit tips, right paw digit tips of neonatal mice were dissected, with the left front paws as uncut controls. Controls used for regeneration comparison were the DBA, B6, C3H, and 129 inbred mouse strains. Consecutive X-ray images were captured of the left and right paws at 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days postamputation. MRL mouse digit tips regenerated greater in comparison to all strains tested (p?<?0.05). We next undertook whole genome microarray analysis to identify the genetic mechanisms that contribute to differences in digit tip regeneration. Over 400 genes out of 15,000 were significantly differentially expressed (p?<?0.05) in MRL and DBA mice at day 4 in comparison to day 0 control tissue. Of these, 170 genes were upregulated and 280 were downregulated in both mouse strains. Pathway analysis reveals that genes in the BMP/TGF pathway are differentially expressed in both mouse strains (p?<?0.05). Multiple differences between MRL and DBA strains were found in transcription factors that are implicated in gastrulation, including FMN2 and SHRM. Additional differentially expressed genes include NET1 in the WNT signaling pathway. Immunohistochemistry indicates that these proteins are highly expressed in the nuclei of chondrocytes in regenerating digits. We conclude that MRL mice show greater regenerative capacity to heal digit tips and that the increased regenerative capacity of MRL mice may be due to strain specific increased expression of genes involved in the WNT pathway and genes involved in embryonic pattern formation.
