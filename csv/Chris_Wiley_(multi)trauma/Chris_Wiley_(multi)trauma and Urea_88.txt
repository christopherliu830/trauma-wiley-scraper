AB  - Abstract Objective: To describe the neurologic deficits associated with profound hyponatremia in 2 critically ill foals. Series summary: A 4-month-old Thoroughbred colt and an 11-day-old Paint filly presented for acute diarrhea and depression. Severe neurologic deficits including blindness and head pressing were noted upon initial examination along with marked hyponatremia observed on biochemistry profile. Aggressive intravenous sodium replacement increased the serum sodium concentration to subnormal values with concurrent resolution of neurologic deficits. Intensive monitoring and fluid therapy were continued; the Thoroughbred colt was euthanized due to lack of response to the primary disease while the Paint filly was discharged clinically healthy without further complications. New or unique information provided: Mild hyponatremia (122?132?mEq/L) is a common clinicopathologic finding in equine medicine associated with a variety of diseases. The vast majority of horses with mild hyponatremia do not demonstrate direct clinical manifestations as a result of low serum sodium concentration. However, when severe acute hyponatremia occurs (<122?mEq/L), such as with acute enterocolitis, subtle to profound neurologic deficits may be observed and immediate and rapid treatment as well as serial evaluations of serum sodium concentration are warranted. Significant, and potentially permanent, neurologic deficits can occur if water balance and tonicity are not properly addressed. The cases presented here describe additional cases of a previously published disease in foals, acute hyponatremia and associated neurologic deficits, and describe the microscopic examination of the central nervous system in one foal that did not survive.

AB  - Summary As the incidence of diabetes mellitus continues to increase in the United Kingdom, more diabetic patients will present for both elective and emergency surgery. Whilst the underlying pathophysiology of type 1 and type 2 diabetes differs, there is much good evidence that controlling the blood glucose to >?10?mmol.l?1 in the peri-operative period for both types of diabetic patients improves outcome. This should be achieved with a glucose?insulin?potassium regimen in all type 1 diabetics and in type 2 diabetics undergoing moderate or major surgical procedures. After surgery, a decrease in the catabolic hormone response resulting from good analgesia and the avoidance of nausea and vomiting should allow early re-establishment of normal glycaemic control.

AB  - Introduction In ICU the need for acute renal replacement therapy (RRT) associates with high mortality and risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), but there are limited long-term data. We investigated these outcomes and their risk factors. Methods Retrospective analysis of all adult patients admitted to a general, university hospital ICU 2005?2012, excluding chronic dialysis patients. ESRD was defined as need of RRT > 90 days or kidney transplant. Results Of 5766 patients included, 1004 (16%) received acute RRT; their 30-day mortality was 42% vs. 16% for those not requiring acute RRT (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.13 (0.96?1.32)). The 90-day mortality was 55% for patients receiving acute RRT vs. 22% for those who did not (adjusted HR 1.32 (1.15?1.51)) and 1-year mortality was 63% vs. 30%, respectively, (adjusted HR 1.31 (1.16?1.48)). The 7-year risk of ESRD for ICU patients surviving 90 days was 10% for patients who received acute RRT vs. 0.5% among those who did not (adjusted HR 5.9 (2.9?12.4)). Independent risk factors for ESRD included pre-existing kidney disease, pre-existing peripheral vascular disease and use of acute RRT in ICU. Conclusions The need of acute RRT was associated with markedly increased long term risk of death and ESRD; in contrast its use was not associated with 30-day mortality. In addition to acute RRT, decreased kidney function and peripheral vascular disease before ICU admission were risk factors for ESRD. It seems warranted offering medical follow-up to patients after acute RRT in ICU.

AB  - Ingrid E. Scheffer ? Austin Health, University of Melbourne, West Heidelberg, VIC, Australia Summary: Until now, the discovery of genes for monogenic epilepsies has not had significant clinical impact. With the finding that around 70% of children with Dravet syndrome, or severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, have mutations of SCN1A, epilepsy genetics has moved into the clinical domain. Recognition of Dravet syndrome requires an understanding of a complex phenotype including seizure onset in the first year of life, multiple seizure types, developmental slowing, neurological deficits and EEG features. Genotype-phenotype correlation has led to the identification of novel SCN1A epileptic encephalopathies such as severe infantile multifocal epilepsy that should also be considered for mutational analysis. Translational research with the development of animal models of SCN1A mutations has led to significant insights into the neurobiology of Dravet syndrome. SCN1A knockout mice recapitulate the human disorder with seizures and ataxia leading to early death in heterozygotes. Mice show strain-specific penetrance of disease reflecting the genetic background effects that modify phenotypic severity in humans. Cellular studies show that dysfunction of the interneuron in cortex, rather than excitatory cells, underlies the phenotype. GABAergic cells are also implicated in the cerebellum with Purkinje cell dysfunction underlying ataxia. The diagnostic finding of a SCN1A mutation associated with Dravet syndrome or a related phenotype has major implications for treatment, prognostic and genetic counseling. Specific antiepileptic agents are effective in Dravet syndrome whilst others cause seizure exacerbation. Stiripentol has been shown to be effective in Dravet syndrome. Early diagnosis allows the clinician to optimise anti-epileptic therapy with the aim of improving developmental outcome.

One of the most classical and common examples of a ?generalized? seizure type is absence seizures, which are characterized by abruptly commencing bihemispheric synchronous spike and wave discharges on the EEG. However evidence is accumulating that absence seizures may actually commence in a geographically localized ?focus? within the somatosensory cortex. Most of this data comes from electrophysiological studies in genetic models, but there is some emerging data from electrophysiological and functional imaging studies in human with absence epilepsies. The proposed workshop will present and discuss data relating to the localization, neurophysiology and underlying pathological basis of the generator of absence seizures in the cortex of rodents, as well as debate the evidence that this may be translatable to human suffers of these absence epilepsies. Gilles van Luijtelaar will discuss ?Neurophysiological and morphological evidence for the cortical absence seizure focus in the WAG/Rij rat?. Didier Pinault will discuss ?Layer VI pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex generate spike-and-wave discharges in GAERS?. Graeme Jackson will discuss ?The evidence for a cortical absence seizure focus in humans: electrophysiological and imaging studies?. John Huguenard will be the discussant.
