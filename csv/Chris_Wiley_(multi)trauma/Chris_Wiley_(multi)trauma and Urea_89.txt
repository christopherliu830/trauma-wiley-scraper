AB  - Introduction In ICU the need for acute renal replacement therapy (RRT) associates with high mortality and risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), but there are limited long-term data. We investigated these outcomes and their risk factors. Methods Retrospective analysis of all adult patients admitted to a general, university hospital ICU 2005?2012, excluding chronic dialysis patients. ESRD was defined as need of RRT > 90 days or kidney transplant. Results Of 5766 patients included, 1004 (16%) received acute RRT; their 30-day mortality was 42% vs. 16% for those not requiring acute RRT (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.13 (0.96?1.32)). The 90-day mortality was 55% for patients receiving acute RRT vs. 22% for those who did not (adjusted HR 1.32 (1.15?1.51)) and 1-year mortality was 63% vs. 30%, respectively, (adjusted HR 1.31 (1.16?1.48)). The 7-year risk of ESRD for ICU patients surviving 90 days was 10% for patients who received acute RRT vs. 0.5% among those who did not (adjusted HR 5.9 (2.9?12.4)). Independent risk factors for ESRD included pre-existing kidney disease, pre-existing peripheral vascular disease and use of acute RRT in ICU. Conclusions The need of acute RRT was associated with markedly increased long term risk of death and ESRD; in contrast its use was not associated with 30-day mortality. In addition to acute RRT, decreased kidney function and peripheral vascular disease before ICU admission were risk factors for ESRD. It seems warranted offering medical follow-up to patients after acute RRT in ICU.

AB  - Dennis Spencer ? Dept of Neurosurgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT Summary: Advances in clinical care for our patients with epilepsy depends on creative problem solving in research.,which frequently comes only when technology provides exactly the right tool for the solution. Our presidential symposium this year highlights four fields in neuroengineering that have already changed how we diagnose and treat patients but promise to further revolutionize not only our understanding of disease mechanisms but also normal brain function. Hoby Heatherington will describe why more powerful high field strength MR is the key to unlocking the spectroscopic chemical analysis of the normal and metabolically deranged brain with epilepsy. Karl Deisseroth utilizes optical and stem-cell based technology for noninvasive imaging and control of brain circuitry. He will describe how this technology probes normal neural circuit dynamics and what it may promise in the treatment of epilepsy and other neurological disorders. Itzak Fried has coupled the technology of microelectrode recordings of human hippocampal ictal events to cognitive challenges that have provided rare insights into how the human hippocampus functions under normal conditions and the stress of epileptogenesis. Finally David Roberts will guide us through the history and the future of how the computer, mathematics and imaging has revolutionized the neurosurgeon's stereotactic approach to intracranial electrophysiological diagnosis and precise delivery of future therapies.

AB  - Ingrid E. Scheffer ? Austin Health, University of Melbourne, West Heidelberg, VIC, Australia Summary: Until now, the discovery of genes for monogenic epilepsies has not had significant clinical impact. With the finding that around 70% of children with Dravet syndrome, or severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, have mutations of SCN1A, epilepsy genetics has moved into the clinical domain. Recognition of Dravet syndrome requires an understanding of a complex phenotype including seizure onset in the first year of life, multiple seizure types, developmental slowing, neurological deficits and EEG features. Genotype-phenotype correlation has led to the identification of novel SCN1A epileptic encephalopathies such as severe infantile multifocal epilepsy that should also be considered for mutational analysis. Translational research with the development of animal models of SCN1A mutations has led to significant insights into the neurobiology of Dravet syndrome. SCN1A knockout mice recapitulate the human disorder with seizures and ataxia leading to early death in heterozygotes. Mice show strain-specific penetrance of disease reflecting the genetic background effects that modify phenotypic severity in humans. Cellular studies show that dysfunction of the interneuron in cortex, rather than excitatory cells, underlies the phenotype. GABAergic cells are also implicated in the cerebellum with Purkinje cell dysfunction underlying ataxia. The diagnostic finding of a SCN1A mutation associated with Dravet syndrome or a related phenotype has major implications for treatment, prognostic and genetic counseling. Specific antiepileptic agents are effective in Dravet syndrome whilst others cause seizure exacerbation. Stiripentol has been shown to be effective in Dravet syndrome. Early diagnosis allows the clinician to optimise anti-epileptic therapy with the aim of improving developmental outcome.

AB  - Summary Robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery in the pediatric population is a new and exciting surgical modality. The anesthesiologist must have an understanding of the fundamentals of robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery and of the implications that this form of surgical intervention has on anesthetic management. Pre-anesthetic evaluation is discussed, including the optimization of the patient's medical condition. Anesthetic medications and equipment are reviewed. The general and specific anesthetic challenges posed by robotic surgery in pediatric patients are discussed, in particular patient positioning, patient monitoring, limitations in patient access, and the physiological effects of a pneumoperitoneum. Fluid and pain management and potential complications from the surgery are reviewed.

One of the most classical and common examples of a ?generalized? seizure type is absence seizures, which are characterized by abruptly commencing bihemispheric synchronous spike and wave discharges on the EEG. However evidence is accumulating that absence seizures may actually commence in a geographically localized ?focus? within the somatosensory cortex. Most of this data comes from electrophysiological studies in genetic models, but there is some emerging data from electrophysiological and functional imaging studies in human with absence epilepsies. The proposed workshop will present and discuss data relating to the localization, neurophysiology and underlying pathological basis of the generator of absence seizures in the cortex of rodents, as well as debate the evidence that this may be translatable to human suffers of these absence epilepsies. Gilles van Luijtelaar will discuss ?Neurophysiological and morphological evidence for the cortical absence seizure focus in the WAG/Rij rat?. Didier Pinault will discuss ?Layer VI pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex generate spike-and-wave discharges in GAERS?. Graeme Jackson will discuss ?The evidence for a cortical absence seizure focus in humans: electrophysiological and imaging studies?. John Huguenard will be the discussant.

An optimal therapy is lacking, and to date there has been no animal model that sufficiently replicates clinical features, so our understanding of mechanism is incomplete. Existing therapies are limited by effectiveness, availability or both. Yet, each of these challenges offers a unique opportunity to advance clinical and basic knowledge of this developmental epilepsy. This symposium will discuss recent advances about the clinical profile, therapeutic modalities, outcome, and mechanisms of infantile spasms. Dr. Nordli will review infantile spasms presentations and clinial features, especially variants. Dr. Lux will discuss current and future treatments. Dr. Carmant will discuss outcomes of infantile spasms. Finally, Dr. Stafstrom will consider emerging animal models that might shed light on infantile spasms mechanisms.

AB  - Left displaced abomasum (LDA) and abomasal volvulus (AV) occur most commonly in postparturient dairy cows. Our main hypothesis was that endotoxemia occurred more frequently in the peripheral blood of cows with LDA or AV than in healthy cows because increased luminal pressure in AV or LDA, or the presence of a hemorrhagic strangulating obstruction in AV, may have injured the abomasal mucosa, thereby facilitating translocation of luminal endotoxin into the circulation. Therefore, our main objective was to compare the prevalence and magnitude of endotoxemia in healthy postparturient cows with the prevalence and magnitude of endotoxemia in cows with AV and LDA. We examined 60 adult dairy cows in early lactation that were diagnosed with AV (n = 15) or LDA (n = 15) or were healthy on physical examination (control group, n = 30). Jugular venous blood was obtained from cows in all 3 groups, and right gastroepiploic venous blood was obtained during surgical correction of AV and LDA immediately after repositioning of the abomasum. Platelet-rich plasma endotoxin concentrations were measured with a chromogenic limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. Endotoxin was detected in jugular vein plasma in 50% (15/30) of control cows; however, the prevalence of endotoxemia was significantly lower (P < .05) in cows with AV (7%, 1/15) or LDA (20%, 3/15). Endotoxin was detected simultaneously in right gastroepiploic and jugular vein plasma in only 1 cow with LDA and 0 cows with AV. Contrary to our hypothesis, we conclude that endotoxemia is infrequently present in postparturient dairy cows with AV or LDA.
