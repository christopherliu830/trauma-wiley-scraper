AB  - Summary Dyspnoea is a common presenting symptom in the older patient and is often multifactorial, with a wide differential of contributing pathologies. Dyspnoea is a distressing symptom and significantly impacts on quality of life. Older adults with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease may present with a disturbance in daily function and mental status rather more typical symptoms experienced in younger patients. Cardiac failure in older patients has a high mortality and management strategies may be complicated by other comorbidities, especially renal failure. Increasing numbers of patients are dying of end stage lung disease and may present to the Emergency Department requiring palliation of their symptoms. This chapter includes: A focus on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiac failure: including presentation, investigations and potential therapies in the older patient A discussion on the role of non-invasive and invasive ventilation in the older adult with respiratory failure A guideline to the management of end-stage lung disease in the acute setting

AB  - Abstract Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare and often fatal soft-tissue infection involving the superficial fascial layers of the extremities, abdomen or perineum. Progression to septic shock can occur very rapidly with its associated high morbidity and mortality. NF is usually caused by beta haemolytic streptococci; less often a poly-microbial isolate is the cause. It typically occurs in patients with some degree of immune dysfunction. We present a case of severe pneumococcal necrotizing fasciitis in an obese patient with Type 2 diabetes. There was no history of trauma or evidence of diabetes-related complications. The initial presentation was with features of septic arthritis of the left knee, which subsequently progressed to NF. Differentiation from cellulitis is often difficult in the early stages. Invasive pneumococcal infections are extremely rare, with only a few reported in the literature. Moreover, our case highlights the need to consider other differential diagnoses (and to look out for complications) in patients with diabetes, especially if there is little clinical response to the initial treatment.

AB  - Scurvy is a rarely seen disease resulting from a deficiency of vitamin C. We present a case of scurvy in a 65-year-old man. The patient reported heavy alcohol abuse over the last several years. He also reported that his diet consisted of cheese pizzas only. On physical examination, he was noted to have spontaneous ecchymosis of his lower extremities (denying any history of trauma); poor dentition; and corkscrew hairs on his chest, abdomen, and legs, with associated perifollicular petechia. Punch biopsy of his skin lesions revealed perivascular lymphohistiocytic inflammation, with some focal perifollicular erythrocyte extravasation. A serum ascorbic acid level was<0.12 mg/dL (normal range, 0.20?1.9 mg/dL). A diagnosis of vitamin C deficiency was made. The patient was successfully treated with 1 g/d vitamin C for the first 5 days, followed by a dose of 500 mg/d. Though scurvy is rarely seen in modern times, it is important to identify who is at risk and to recognize the clear and classic signs and symptoms associated with scurvy. Failure to diagnose this disease can potentially lead to expensive and unnecessary medical tests, as well as missing a very simple treatment that can prevent infection and even death.

AB  - Summary Topical treatments have been used in wound care for centuries. Many of the treatments, however, have not ? or only to a very limited degree ? undergone scientific scrutiny. This is especially true for many of the products that are available over the counter. Determining the contents of many of these products can be difficult, and as a rule of thumb, products without a list of ingredients should not be used on wounds. In contrast, effects of wound cleansers and solutions used for irrigation have been investigated in several studies. Although cleansers and antiseptics had, for some years, fallen out of favor due to their detrimental effects on cells cultured in vitro, current best evidence suggests that they may be of benefit if used judiciously. The negative impact on cell cultures has, in many studies, not been replicated when the products were used in vivo. Use of antiseptics on heavily contaminated or infected wounds seems to enhance healing through a reduction of the wound's bioburden.

AB  - Daily hemofiltration (D-HF) is a new treatment modality that shows unique solute removal characteristics and possibly provides high quality of life for patients with end-stage renal disease. Objective:? To evaluate solute-removal characteristics of D-HF by kinetic modeling analysis. Methods:? Five HD patients with normal 4?h???3 times/week were switched to D-HF (2?h???6 times/week). Ultrafiltration rates (QF) or small solute clearances were approximately 100?mL/min. All the necessary kinetic parameters were determined from patients' physical data and HD portion of the clinical measurements. The two-compartment kinetic model predicted the concentration changes after switching from normal HD to D-HF. Results:? Concentrations of small solutes such as urea?nitrogen (UN) increased, whereas that of ?2-microglobulin (?2-MG) decreased after switching from normal HD to D-HF (Figure?1). Predicted solute concentrations for UN as well as ?2-MG correlated well with the clinical results. The model predicted that QF?=?140?mL/min may be required for time-averaged concentration (TAC) of UN to be unchanged. The model also predicted that the 7-times/week D-HF may not increase the TAC of UN very much even after switching from normal HD to D-HF. Conclusion:? D-HF is suitable for removing larger solutes but may not be good enough for removing small solutes. A 7-day treatment (7 times/week) may greatly improve the solute removal capacity of the so-called daily treatment (6 times/week) not only for larger solutes but also for small solutes.

AB  - Abstract Urinary bladder malfunction and disorders are caused by congenital diseases, trauma, inflammation, radiation, and nerve injuries. Loss of normal bladder function results in urinary tract infection, incontinence, renal failure, and end-stage renal dysfunction. In severe cases, bladder augmentation is required using segments of the gastrointestinal tract. However, use of gastrointestinal mucosa can result in complications such as electrolyte imbalance, stone formation, urinary tract infection, mucous production, and malignancy. Recent tissue engineering techniques use acellular grafts, cultured cells combined with biodegradable scaffolds, and cell sheets. These techniques are not all currently applicable for human bladder reconstruction. However, new avenues for bladder reconstruction maybe facilitated by a better understanding of urogenital development, the cellular and molecular biology of urothelium, and cell?cell interactions, which modulate tissue repair, homeostasis, and disease progression.

AB  - Summary The management of dental emergencies in the hospital environment has evolved dramatically over the past few decades. General and pediatric dentists, as well as oral and maxillofacial surgeons are now often the primary providers of care and might manage everything from a simple toothache to the most severe maxillofacial maladies and craniofacial injuries. A thorough knowledge of the organizational, triage, and treatment protocols in the emergency department greatly enhances the dentist's ability to provide rapid, appropriate, and broadly scoped emergency care. This chapter discusses, inter alia, medicolegal aspects of emergency care, intra-oral urgencies, postoperative emergencies, odontogenic infections, salivary gland emergencies, maxillofacial trauma, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) emergencies, in detail.

AB  - Objectives To describe the biochemical changes ? also known as the storage lesion ? that occur in canine packed red blood cells during ex vivo storage. Materials and Methods Ten 125-mL units of non-leuco-reduced packed red blood cells in citrate phosphate dextrose adenine were obtained from a commercial blood bank within 24 hours of donation. Samples were aseptically collected on days 1, 4, 7, 14, 28, 35 and 42 for measurement of sodium, potassium, chloride, lactate, glucose, pH and ammonia concentrations. All units were cultured on day 42. Friedman's repeated measures test with Dunn's multiple comparison test was used for non-parametric data. A repeated-measures analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparison test was used for parametric data. Alpha was set to 0·05. Results All analytes changed significantly during storage. The mean ammonia on day 1 (58·14 g/dL) was significantly lower (P<0·05) than those on days 28 (1266 g/dL), 35 (1668 g/dL) and 42 (1860 g/dL). A significant increase in median lactate concentration over time was also observed, with day 1 (4·385 mmol/L) being significantly less (P<0·05) than days 14 (19·82 mmol/L), 21 (22·81 mmol/L), 35 (20·31 mmol/L) and 42 (20·81 mmol/L). Median pH was significantly decreased after day 7. All bacterial cultures were negative. Clinical Significance Many biochemical alterations occur in stored canine packed red blood cells, although further studies are required to determine their clinical importance.

AB  - Acquired neuromuscular weakness due to critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy (CIPNM) frequently develops in patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit for more than 1?week. CIPNM may present with muscle weakness and failure to wean from mechanical ventilation, but is discovered more often and earlier by electrophysiological examination. In this review, the incidence, clinical and electrophysiological features, differential diagnosis and prognosis of CIPNM will be described. Risk factors for CIPNM are sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome and the severity of multi-organ failure. Presence of CIPNM is associated with higher mortality rate, prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and prolonged rehabilitation. The majority of survivors with CIPNM have persistent functional disabilities and a reduced quality of life. There is need for new therapeutic strategies to prevent or minimize CIPNM in critically ill patients.

AB  - Abstract The paper overviews various methods that are used for the analysis of output signals generated by enzyme-based logic systems. The considered methods include optical techniques (optical absorbance, fluorescence spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance), electrochemical techniques (cyclic voltammetry, potentiometry, impedance spectroscopy, conductivity measurements, use of field effect transistor devices, pH measurements), and various mechanoelectronic methods (using atomic force microscope, quartz crystal microbalance). Although each of the methods is well known for various bioanalytical applications, their use in combination with the biomolecular logic systems is rather new and sometimes not trivial. Many of the discussed methods have been combined with the use of signal-responsive materials to transduce and amplify biomolecular signals generated by the logic operations. Interfacing of biocomputing logic systems with electronics and ?smart? signal-responsive materials allows logic operations be extended to actuation functions; for example, stimulating molecular release and switchable features of bioelectronic devices, such as biofuel cells. The purpose of this review article is to emphasize the broad variability of the bioanalytical systems applied for signal transduction in biocomputing processes. All bioanalytical systems discussed in the article are exemplified with specific logic gates and multi-gate networks realized with enzyme-based biocatalytic cascades.

Advancing age is a risk factor for acute kidney injury, and is associated with a higher mortality and reduced renal recovery. Standard diagnostic criteria may miss acute kidney injury in the older patient. Sodium disturbances may be multifactorial and the cause may be more difficult to determine in the older patient. Symptoms and signs are largely related to speed of onset. Hypercalcaemia requiring emergency treatment is most often due to malignancy.

AB  - Summary This chapter commences with the management of suspected giant cell arteritis (GCA). It is recommended to consider vasculitis in the patient with systemic symptoms and headache or evidence of organ dysfunction. The diagnosis of a specific vasculitis is based on the pattern of organ injury, characteristic features on imaging, the size of involved blood vessels and histological findings on biopsy. GCA usually presents with new-onset headache in older people, associated with constitutional upset; it carries a significant risk (20-30%) of visual loss from ischaemic optic neuropathy, and so needs urgent assessment and treatment. Typical presentations of acute vasculitis include headache, neurological presentation with stroke, hearing loss, and haemoptysis. With the exception of suspected GCA, early intervention with high-dose corticosteroid therapy is rarely needed, and should not be given unless advised by a specialist. The chapter also presents information on considerations in suspected GCA and new presentation of suspected systemic vasculitis.
