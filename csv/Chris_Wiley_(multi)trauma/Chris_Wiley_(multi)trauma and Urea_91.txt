AB  - Clin Microbiol Infect 2012; 18: E314?E330 Abstract In China, there are four types of liver abscesses (LAs) that meet the clinical criteria. Pyogenic liver abscesses (PLAs) and amoebic liver abscesses (ALAs) are two of the most common types of abscesses, followed by fungal liver abscesses (FLAs) and hydatid secondary liver abscesses (HsLAs). Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with the development of PLAs. However, there is a lack of population-based studies that have evaluated the underlying relationship between LAs (mainly PLAs and FLAs) and DM. We conducted a retrospective study based on a large population to identify the potential differences and factors that affect the mortality of PLA patients in DM and non-DM groups. Our results revealed that the prevalence of DM is 44.3% (158/357) in PLA patients and 35.3% (18/51) in FLA patients. Compared with the non-DM patients, statistically significant differences were found in DM patients according to symptomatology, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, microbiological characteristics, antimicrobial resistance, clinical treatments and outcomes in relation to mortality. In addition, the status of antibiotic resistance to E. coli and K. pneumoniae, which were isolated from the patient samples, is severe in the area in which the study was conducted. Regarding the treatment of PLAs, our study indicated that broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy and drug combinations should be recommended and initiated before the pathogens are cultured and identified. In the clinic, therapies that combine percutaneous drainage with antibiotics and surgery with antibiotics are the two most useful strategies for treating an LA. These two combined treatments resulted in satisfactory cure rates. In the DM and non-DM groups, the cure rates for percutaneous drainage with antibiotics were 90.3% and 92.0%, respectively, and the cure rates for surgery with antibiotics were 93.9% and 95.2%, respectively.

AB  - Abstract:? Background:? Currently, there is no direct treatment for hepatic failure, and patients must receive a transplant or endure prolonged hospitalization, with significant morbidity and mortality. Because of the scarcity of donor organs, liver support strategies are being developed with the aim of either supporting patients with borderline functional liver cell mass until an appropriate organ becomes available for transplantation or until their livers recover from injury. Methods:? A literature review was performed using MEDLINE and library searches. Only major blood detoxification/purification devices and cell-based techniques are included in this review. Results:? Currently, a number of blood purification systems and devices utilizing viable liver cells are in various stages of clinical development. Non-biological systems include plasma exchange, albumin dialysis, hemo(dia)filtration, and sorbent-based devices (charcoal, resin). These systems are able to remove toxins of hepatic failure, and their utility is limited by their inability to provide missing liver-specific functions. In contrast, hepatocyte-based devices are able to provide whole liver functions, including detoxification, biosynthesis, and biotransformation. Molecular adsorbent recycling system (MARS) blood detoxification system has been tested in thousands of patients, but additional well-conducted controlled studies are warranted to better define the role of MARS? in the treatment of patients with acute hepatic failure and acute exacerbation of chronic liver disease. HepatAssist? was tested in a phase II/III controlled clinical trial that demonstrated safety and proof of concept for use of biological liver support systems to improve patient survival in acute hepatic failure. Conclusions:? Developing an effective liver assist technology has proven difficult, because of the complexity of liver functions that must be replaced, as well as heterogeneity of the patient population. Non-biological systems may have a role in the treatment of specific forms of liver failure where the primary goal is to provide blood detoxification/purification. Biological systems appear to be useful in treating liver failure where the primary objective is to provide whole liver functions which are impaired or lost. It is suggested that there will be a role for hybrid liver support systems that offer liver cell therapy and various forms of blood purification (sorption, hemofiltration and diafiltration) to treat patients with specific forms of liver failure at various stages of their illness.

AB  - PURPOSE: To review the role of excitatory neurotransmitters in normal mammalian brain function, the concept of excitotoxic neuronal death as an important final common path in a variety of diseases, and modification of excitatory synaptic transmission as an important new pharmacological principle. These principles are discussed, with special emphasis on diseases of importance to older adults. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search from 1966 to May 1995 was undertaken, as well as a manual search of current issues of clinical and basic neuroscience journals, for articles that addressed glutamate N-methyl-D aspartate and/or excitotoxicity. STUDY SELECTION: A total of 5398 original and 68 review articles were identified that addressed animal and human experimentation relevant to excitotoxic neuronal death. There were 364 articles with potential significance for clinical application identified; 132 of the most recent references are provided. DATA EXTRACTION: All articles were classified into three categories: general receptor, biology pathogenesis of disease, and pharmacotherapy. RESULTS: Glutamic and aspartic acids are the physiological mediators of most excitatory synaptic transmission. This is critical to several normal nervous system functions, including memory and long-term modification of synaptic transmission and nociception. Activation of the inotropic NMDA and non-NMDA receptors increases transmembrane calcium and sodium fluxes, and the metabotropic glutamate receptor activation results in generation of inositol triphosphate and inhibition of adenylate cyclase. Numerous modulatory sites exist, especially on the NMDA receptor. Nitric oxide, arachidonic acid, superoxide, and intracellular calcium overload are the ultimate mediators of neuronal death. Glutamate re-uptake transporters belong to a unique family of amino acid transport systems, the malfunction of which is intricately involved in disease pathogenesis. Ischemic stroke, hypoglycemia, Parkinson's disease, alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and chronic pain syndromes are only some of the important clinical neurological disorders with a major pathogenic role for the excitatory amino acids. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological manipulation of the excitatory amino acid receptors is likely to be of benefit in important and common diseases of the nervous system. Only a few of the currently available drugs that modify excitatory neurotransmission, such as remacemide, lamotrigine, and tizanidine, have an acceptable therapeutic index. The identification of numerous receptor subtypes, topographic variabilities of distribution, and multiple modulatory sites will provide a true challenge to the neuropharmacologist.

AB  - Calciphylaxis is a rare but significant condition. It is associated with a high degree of morbidity and is fatal in between 60% and 80% of patients. It occurs most commonly in patients with endstage renal failure and is associated with hypercalcaemia or hyperphosphataemia or both (elevated calcium-phosphate product). Secondary hyperparathyroidism is also common. Clinically, patients develop rapidly progressive, necrotic skin ulcers that are extremely painful. They, universally, respond poorly to usual ulcer therapies. Some surgeons advocate parathyroidectomy for patients with calciphylaxis. Evidence is inconclusive regarding this treatment; however, some trials have shown improved rates of ulcer healing and overall survival in patients treated with parathyroidectomy.
