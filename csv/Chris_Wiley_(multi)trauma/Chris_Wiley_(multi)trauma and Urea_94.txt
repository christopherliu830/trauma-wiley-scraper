AB  - Abstract Joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS), or Ehlers?Danlos syndrome (EDS) hypermobility type (EDS-HT), is a underdiagnosed heritable connective tissue disorder characterized by generalized joint hypermobility and a wide range of visceral, pelvic, neurologic, and cognitive dysfunctions. Deterioration of quality of life is mainly associated with pain and fatigue. Except for the recognized effectiveness of physiotherapy for some musculoskeletal features, there are no standardized guidelines for the assessment and treatment of pain and fatigue. In this work, a practical classification of pain presentations and factors contributing in generating painful sensations in JHS/EDS-HT is proposed. Pain can be topographically classified in articular limb (acute/subacute and chronic), muscular limb (myofascial and fibromyalgia), neuropathic limb, back/neck, abdominal and pelvic pain, and headache. For selected forms of pain, specific predisposing characteristics are outlined. Fatigue appears as the result of multiple factors, including muscle weakness, respiratory insufficiency, unrefreshing sleep, dysautonomia, intestinal malabsorption, reactive depression/anxiety, and excessive use of analgesics. A set of lifestyle recommendations to instruct patients as well as specific investigations aimed at characterizing pain and fatigue are identified. Available treatment options are discussed in the set of a structured multidisciplinary approach based on reliable outcome tools. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Emerging evidence supports the involvement of autophagy in the pathogenesis of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play fundamental roles in various cellular processes, including autophagy. However, it remains largely unknown as to how autophagy is regulated by miRNAs and lncRNAs in IDD. Biological functions of miR-153-3p and long intergenic nonprotein coding RNA 641 (LINC00641) were investigated. Luciferase reporter assays was done to validate miR-153-3p targets. To induce nutritional stress, nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were cultured in the normal nutritional condition and the low nutritional condition. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to analyze miR-153-3p and LINC00641 in response to nutrient deprivation. Autophagic activity was assessed by transmission electron microscopy, western blot analysis and green fluorescent protein-light chain 3 puncta. Pull-down assay and RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization were performed to validate LINC00641 target and the location. MiR-153-3p is downregulated in NP tissues from IDD patients. Further, LINC00641 can affect collagen II and matrix metalloproteinase-3 expressions. Upregulation of LINC00641 and downregulation of miR-153-3p are detected in NP cells under nutritional stress. LINC00641 can regulate autophagic cell death by targeting miR-153-3p and autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5). MiR-153-3p inhibits autophagy and IDD by targeting ATG5. More important, LINC00641 targets miR-153-3p, and thus affects ATG5 expression, autophagic cell death and IDD. These findings uncover a novel regulatory pathway that is composed of LINC00641, miR-153-3p, and ATG5 in IDD. This mechanism may stimulate to a more understanding of IDD pathogenesis and provide new sights for the treatment of this disorder.

AB  - Abstract Although intra-dialytic hypertension (IDH) has been noted in clinical settings for many years, its pathogenesis remains unclear. In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed IDH incidence in our center and the correlation between postdialysis volume state and IDH. One hundred thirty-one maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients were enrolled in our study, and bioelectrical impedance (BIA) and echocardiography (ECG) were recorded. In addition, demographic data were collected, and laboratory examinations were conducted. The patients were grouped into four groups according to the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) between predialysis and postdialysis. The incidence of IDH was 10.7%. The proportion of extracellular water to total body weight (ECW/TW), as evaluated by BIA, was significantly higher in the IDH group than in the other three groups both in pre-and post-dialysis. In particular, postdialysis SBP was highest in the highest tertile interval of ECW/TW. In addition, among the four groups, left ventricular volume (LVV) was highest in the IDH group. Binary logistic analyses revealed that predialysis SBP, postdialysis ECW/TW and LVV were independent risk factors of intradialytic hypertension. When predicting IDH, the AUC of the ROC curve was higher for ECW/TW combined with LVV (0.752, 95% CI 0.613?0.896) than for either LVV or ECW/TW alone. Our study further showed that post-dialysis volume expansion is an important factor for the development of IDH.

AB  - Summary Stroke is a common cause of disability and death, but prompt recognition and appropriate initial treatment may save lives or mitigate the morbidity of stroke. Selected patients at specialist centres may benefit from emergency intravenous thrombolysis or decompressive craniectomy, but all patients stand to benefit from stroke unit care and should have their risk factors addressed with consideration of the institution of secondary prevention measures, aimed at reducing the risk of recurrence. A stroke may be the consequence of a number of heterogeneous conditions and further investigation will aid diagnosis. Structural imaging of the carotid arteries will allow the detection of those with a carotid stenosis likely to cause recurrent symptoms. In these patients, revascularization by carotid endarterectomy should be offered as an urgent procedure. Intracerebral haemorrhage and subarachnoid haemorrhage are also important causes of neurodisability. Neurosurgical or neuroradiological intervention to prevent recurrence of haemorrhage in the presence of an underlying vascular abnormality should be considered.
