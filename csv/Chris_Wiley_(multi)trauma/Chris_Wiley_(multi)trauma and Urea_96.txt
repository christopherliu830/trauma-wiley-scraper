AB  - Summary This chapter focuses on the normal sequence of events in marrow function, the roles played by circulating cells in homeostasis, and on the adverse effects caused by exposure to various drugs and other chemicals leading to commonly observed hemopathies. The hair follicle's proliferative activity is matched only by the bone marrow and some parts of the gastrointestinal tract. In contrast to the skin, the respiratory tract has no barrier, other than the bronchial mucous layer, against the entry of foreign substances into the body. The chapter also focuses on the parts of the endocrine system relating to thyroid and sex hormones in humans and laboratory animals that are of interest to toxicology. Clinical experience with immunosuppressive drugs indicates that the immune system usually has a high capacity to regenerate after exposure has ended.

AB  - Abstract Bats are becoming increasingly important as an experimental model due to their unique biological features. These include the ability of powered flight, minimal consequences from a heightened metabolic state, extended longevity in most species and minimal inflammation in response to most otherwise pathogenic viruses. To date there has been limited work done on the optimal procedures for necropsy, extraction of tissues or preparation of cell suspensions for downstream experimental work. Here we use Pteropus alecto black flying fox as an example model of the fruit bat to develop optimal procedures for anaesthetizing, necropsy methods, safety, sequence and protocols for cell/tissue extraction and isolation protocols. These methods were successfully used to yield high-quality RNA, DNA and protein samples from tissues along with viable cells for various molecular and immunological studies. Procedures utilized are suitable for comparative biology studies with most protocols being directly modified from those used in mice and humans. While mainly optimized for the larger fruit bats (flying foxes) in this study, the majority of protocols can readily be adapted to all species of bats. This study provides the framework for greater consistency with in vivo bat experiments, application for comparative biology studies and greater engagement of the bat community for suitable protocols to be harmoniously adopted.

AB  - Abstract Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an acute gastrointestinal disorder that is the most common and requiring emergency hospitalization. Its incidence is increasing worldwide, thus increasing the burden of medical services. Approximately 20% of the patients develop moderate to severe necrotizing pancreatitis associated with pancreatic or peri-pancreatic tissue necrosis and multiple organ failure. There are many reports about the anti-inflammatory effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on pancreatitis and the repair of tissue damage. MSCs cells come from a wide range of sources, autologous MSCs come from bone marrow and allogeneic MSCs such as umbilical cord blood MSCs, placenta-derived MSCs, etc. The wide source is not only an advantage of MSCs but also a disadvantage of MSCs. Because of different cell sources and different methods of collection and preparation, it is impossible to establish a unified standard method for evaluation of efficacy. The biggest advantage of iMSCs is that it can be prepared by a standardized process, and can be prepared on a large scale, which makes it easier to commercialize. This paper reviews the present status of diagnosis and progress of MSCs therapy for AP.

AB  - Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly spreading, life-threatening, bacterial disease. Mortality rates have been estimated to vary between 8.7% and 74%. Mortality depends on many factors, one of which Is early recognition. Necrotizing fasciitis of dental origin has a low prevalence and as such presents diagnostic challenges for the dentist. The literature is reviewed, and a case history Is presented.

AB  - Summary What is known and Objective:? Literature provides much evidence regarding liposomal amphotericin B treatment for fungal infections in neonates and infants. Relevant data regarding critically ill paediatric patients of older age are scarce. We aimed to present our experience regarding liposomal amphotericin B use in critically ill paediatric patients from a tertiary-care paediatric hospital in Athens, Greece. Methods:? We prospectively identified all paediatric patients who received treatment with liposomal amphotericin B in the intensive care unit of a tertiary-care paediatric hospital during a 3-year period (2005?2008). Data were retrieved from the evaluation of the available medical records. Results and Discussion:? Twenty-three (nine females, mean age: 26·4?months, range: 5?39 months) critically ill paediatric patients were included; 12 had malignancy. In 16 of the 23 included children, liposomal amphotericin B was administered for the treatment of confirmed fungal infections (all but one were invasive), whereas in seven patients, it was used as pre-emptive treatment. One patient received voriconazole concomitantly. Eleven of the 16 children with documented infections were cured; five improved. Six of the seven children who received pre-emptive treatment also showed clinical improvement. Nine deaths were noted, all attributed to underlying diseases. Two cases of hepatotoxicity and one case of nephrotoxicity (all leading to drug-discontinuation) occurred. Seven and five cases of mild reversible hypokalaemia and hyponatraemia, respectively, were also noted. What is new and Conclusion:? According to the findings of our small case series, liposomal amphotericin B may provide a useful treatment option for fungal infections of vulnerable critically ill paediatric patients with considerable comorbidity.

AB  - Summary.? Recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) has become the best choice for treating bleeding of haemophilia A patients. A plasma- and albumin-free recombinant FVIII (rAHF-PFM, ADVATE?), as the third generation rFVIII, virtually eliminates the risk of blood-borne disease transmission by excluding all human blood derived additives throughout cell culture, purification and formulation. In this multicentre prospective clinical study we evaluated the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of ADVATE? in Chinese patients with haemophilia A. Fifty-eight patients enrolled and received ADVATE? treatment. Of the patients enrolled, eight (13.79%) had severe haemophilia, 45 (77.59%) had moderate haemophilia and five (8.62%) had mild haemophilia. Fifty-four patients completed 6?months of observation. A total of 781 bleeds occurred in these 58 subjects, all evaluable per-protocol. A total of 984 infusions were administered with a mean of 17.0?±?11.1 infusions per patient. On average, each patient received a mean of 15030.2?± 7972.7?IU ADVATE? (median 13?625?IU, range 9500?19?750?IU) during 6?months. The majority of bleeding episodes (95.9%) were successfully treated with one or two infusions of ADVATE?. Overall, response to the first ADVATE? treatment was rated as either ?excellent? (82.8%) or ?improved? (17.2%) in all subjects. All patients tolerated ADVATE? infusions well. One patient (1/58, 1.7%) developed an inhibitor of 4?Betheseda units at day 180 visit. The results of this clinical observational study support that ADVATE? is efficacious, safe and well tolerated in the treatment of Chinese patients with haemophilia A.
