AB  - Abstract Objective To investigate, develop and evaluate anatomical, surgical and anastomotic aspects necessary for a successful uterine transplant in a large-animal model. Design Sheep model; longitudinal study involving five ewes. Setting Royal Veterinary College, London, UK. Population Five ewes of proven fertility. Methods The uterine allograft along with the internal iliacs, and uterine arterial and venous tree all intact were harvested en bloc. An end-to-side anastomosis was performed between the external iliac vessels and the internal iliac vessels of the graft using 6-0 polypropylene. Successful reperfusion of the graft was initially judged by the color shift of the uterus during reperfusion. Blood flow past the venous and arterial anastomotic sites was also ensured by visual inspection, together with pulse oximetry and multispectral imaging. Main outcome measures Operative details (retrieval, ischemic, clamping, reperfusion and recipient hysterectomy duration); physiological profiles; gross morphology and histopathology. Results Five autotransplants were performed. One procedure was abandoned because of the inappropriate size of sheep model. Another procedure was halted because the animal suffered from respiratory failure in the immediate intra-operative period. Three transplants were completed. In those, at least two of four possible anastomoses were finished and the grafted uteri demonstrated immediate perfusion and appropriate viability 45 min post-operatively. Conclusions Internal to external iliac vessel anastomoses are an acceptable surgical technique that should be applied in a human model to ensure adequate subsequent uterine perfusion.

AB  - Summary It has not been adequately evaluated whether the outcome of infections differs by body-weight category. We performed a systematic review of relevant studies. Eleven studies (one retrospective and 10 prospective cohort studies) were included in this review, involving a total of 3159 hospitalized patients or nursing home residents. Most studies (6/11) referred to lower respiratory tract infections. Seven studies showed an association of patient outcome (mortality in 6/7 studies) with body-weight category. This was shown in multivariate analysis in 4/5 studies that reported relevant data. Obese or morbidly obese patients with infections had worse outcome compared with the rest of the patients or with normal-weight patients, in 4/7 studies that reported relevant data; findings were not significant in the remaining three studies. Patients in the lowest body mass index (BMI) group had worse outcome compared with all other groups combined, in 3/5 studies that reported relevant data; findings were not significant in the remaining two studies. Low BMI was associated with worse outcome in patients with lower respiratory tract infections in 3/4 relevant studies. Although not consistently reported, an association of both ends of the BMI distribution with worse outcome of infections is plausible and merits further investigation.

AB  - Abstract At present, it is frequently accepted to expand the organ pool for liver transplantation (LTx) by including livers from critical donors. From 1990 to June 2002 a total of 1,208 LTx were performed. Of those, 67 livers from donors older than 60 years were transplanted to 66 patients, including re-LTx in eight patients. Fourteen patients had malignant diseases (21%). Ten patients had a high urgency status (15%). Median donor age was 65 years (range 61?80 years). Primary graft function was observed in 84%. Patient survival rate at 1 and 5 years was 79% and 62%, and graft survival was 68% and 53%, respectively. No difference was observed in LTx with livers from donors younger than 60 years. Fifteen graft losses occurred during the study. Surgical complications were observed in 23 patients (34%). The outcome of LTx with livers from donors older than 60 years is satisfactory and is comparable to results of LTx with livers from donors younger than 60 years. The frequency of vascular complications and cholestasis syndrome is not increased.
