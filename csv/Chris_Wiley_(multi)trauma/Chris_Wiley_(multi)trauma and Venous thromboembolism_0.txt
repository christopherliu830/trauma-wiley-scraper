AB  - Abstract Background:? The optional filter is gaining ground, supplementing anticoagulation in the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in high-risk surgical patients, this despite knowledge gaps relating to its efficacy. We studied the literature and audited our experience with inferior vena cava filters to educate ourselves on this mode of VTE prophylaxis, particularly its practical implications, if any, for the surgeon. Methods:? A retrospective clinical study on inferior vena cava filter (IVCF)-related events in a Western Australian tertiary centre in 2008 was performed. Literature on IVCFs was reviewed. Results:? The 118 IVCF-related events at our centre in 2008, involved either Recovery-G2 75(88%) or Cook-Celect nine (11%). Of these, 78 were insertions and 36 were retrievals with four failed retrievals (10% of the attempts). Major indications for insertion included multi-trauma 32 (38%), prothrombotic state 29 (34%), head injury/intracranial bleeding 16 (19%) and others eight (9%). The mean dwelling time was 100 days (12?349 days). The mean age was 43 and the retrieval rate was 58%. Conclusion:? Optional filters have presented both versatility and challenge to the management of VTE in high-risk patients. An underlying concern about the quintessential efficacy of IVCFs lingers on, while the impact of lost follow-ups in young patients is still at large. Class 1 studies on optional filters would add certainty to the use of this generation of filters, be a step forward in relevance from the seminal work of Decousus and garner the willingness needed to engage teamwork and institutional proactiveness against loopholes such as lost follow-ups that can undermine the portrayed benefits of a potentially lifesaving device.

AB  - Abstract Venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) increases the risk of mortality in trauma patients. To decrease the occurrence of VTE, low dose anticoagulants are commonly prescribed. This may be unacceptable in trauma patients who have a high risk of bleeding. Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters can be employed as an alternative strategy to decrease the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE). Insertion of an IVC filter is an invasive procedure that has a range of complications. The benefits of IVC filter insertion must be compared to its risk of complications in each individual patient. A search of the literature since 2005 was conducted on MEDLINE, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Embase. The clinical question posed was does prophylactic IVC filter insertion decrease the risk of PE in trauma patients? The available evidence was low level and unable to definitively answer this question. The majority of articles infer that IVC filter insertion is safe and may decrease the risk of PE. However, there is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to be conducted in this area.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective.? The application of continuous peripheral nerve block (CPNB) has been an important anesthetic tool in the management of combat soldiers wounded from current conflicts. Placing and maintaining CPNBs becomes a challenge in this patient population due to concomitant prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation. Case Report.? A 32-year-old male sustained multiple traumatic injuries from an improvised explosive device, including a right tibial fracture, a left tibial fracture, and a left ulnar fracture. His pain was originally well controlled with a left infraclavicular CPNB (0.2% ropivacaine at 10?mL/h with 3?mL bolus every 20 minutes) and an epidural (0.2% ropivacaine at 10?mL/h with 5?mL bolus every 30 minutes). He subsequently developed a common femoral vein thrombus and was treated with low-molecular-weight heparin. His epidural catheter was discontinued; however, his pain was not well controlled with intravenous and oral pain medication. We elected to place bilateral, tunneled sciatic CPNBs and a left, tunneled femoral CPNB. We started infusions of 0.2% ropivacaine at 10?mL/h in each catheter, in addition to 5?mL every 30 minutes demand dose in each sciatic catheter. The patient's serum ropivacaine levels were analyzed 24 hours after the start of the infusions and were found to be 5.8?mg/L and <0.1?mg/L for total and free concentrations, respectively. Conclusions.? This case highlights the application of simultaneous CPNB techniques in a patient with multiple extremity injuries receiving anticoagulant therapy.

AB  - Summary.? Experience of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa, NovoSeven?; Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) to control haemorrhage in non-haemophilic children is limited. The object of this study was to examine the applicability and safety of rFVIIa amongst a group of non-haemophilic paediatric subjects. Details of all non-haemophilic children ≤16?years receiving rFVIIa whose data were recorded in the investigational, internet-based registry, haemostasis.com were analysed. A total of 265 children (mean age 7.7?years) were treated with rFVIIa; the median dose administered was 78.4??g?kg?1 body weight (range 9.0?393.4) and the median total dose received 100.0??g?kg?1 body weight (range 10.9?1341.2). Therapeutic areas included surgery (34.5%), coagulopathy (including thrombocytopenia; 29.0%), spontaneous bleeding (17.2%), trauma (8.4%) and intracranial haemorrhage (4.5%). Two patients experienced thromboembolic events following administration of rFVIIa. Thirty-nine patients died on account of haemorrhage or complications relating to their underlying condition; neither the thromboembolic events nor the deaths were related to rFVIIa administration. Bleeding stopped in 118/237 (49.8%), markedly decreased in 54/237 (22.8%), decreased in 51/237 (21.5%), remained unchanged in 13/237 (5.5%) and increased in 1/237 (0.4%) patients. These results suggest that rFVIIa is safe and widely applicable in children to control non-haemophilic haemorrhage.
