AB  - Summary Preoperative glucocorticoid administration reduces the systemic inflammatory response. Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a novel inflammatory marker belonging to the humoral arm of innate immunity exerting a potentially protective host response. This study evaluated PTX3 and other complement marker changes after preoperative methylprednisolone (MP) early after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Seventy patients were randomized (1 : 1) to preoperative intravenous (i.v.) MP 125 mg (group MP) or isotonic saline i.v. (group C). The outcomes included change in plasma PTX3, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), ficolins (ficolin-1, ?2 and ?3), complement components (C4 and C3), terminal complement complex (TCC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. Blood samples were analysed at baseline and 2, 6, 24 and 48 h after surgery with complete sampling from 63 patients for analyses. MP resulted in an increase in circulating PTX3 compared to saline from baseline to 24 h postoperatively (P?<?0·001), while MP reduced the systemic inflammatory response (CRP) 24 and 48 h postoperatively (P?<?0·001). However, the small postoperative changes in MBL, ficolin-1, ?2 and ?3, C4, C3 and TCC concentrations did not differ between groups (P?>?0·05). In conclusion, preoperative MP 125 mg increased circulating PTX3 and reduced the general inflammatory response (CRP) early after TKA, but did not affect other complement markers.

AB  - Abstract Introduction. Recognition of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), intensive care, shifting away from early surgical treatment, and monitoring of the intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is important in the management of SAP. The aim of our study was retrospective evaluation and critical assessment of the experience with SAP management protocol involving new strategy in the university hospital. Methods. Protocols of 274 SAP patients treated in our institution during the last eight years were reassessed. APACHE II, CRP and SOFA score, IAP, pulmonary complications, ventilatory support and infection rate were evaluated. The success of the conservative treatment, surgical interventions and mortality was analysed comparing period 1 from 1999 to 2002 and period 2 from 2003 to 2006. Results. More patients with necrotising SAP were treated in period 2. The average CRP and SOFA score was higher in period 2, p=0.018; p=0.011. A total of 139 patients underwent continuous veno-venouse haemofiltration (CVVH) as a component of fluid resuscitation and IAP control. Application of CVVH increased in period 2, p<0.005. Only 5?8% of patients were managed with ventilatory support. The overall infection rate decreased in period 2 comprising 21%, p<0.005. Success rate of the conservative therapy reached 69% in period 2, p<0.01. Surgical treatment was performed in 41% of patients in period 1 vs. 19% in period 2, p<0.001. Overall mortality was 19%, with a reduction to 12% in year 2006. Conclusion. The conservative protocol-based approach is a rational treatment strategy for the management of SAP and can be successfully implemented in the setting of the university hospital.

AB  - ABSTRACT Arthrofibrosis is a common complication following total knee arthroplasty caused by pathologic fibroblast activation and excessive collagen deposition around a synovial joint leading to debilitating loss of motion. Treatment options are limited because the pathologic mechanisms remain to be characterized. Dysregulation of the inflammatory cascade may lead to communication between myofibroblasts and immune cells triggering tissue metaplasia, and excessive collagen deposition described clinically as arthrofibrosis. We explored the novel use of celecoxib (selective cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2] inhibitor) to disrupt the downstream effects of the post-traumatic inflammatory cascade and inhibit scar tissue formation in a validated rabbit model of arthrofibrosis combined with new parameters for quantifying the stiffness of the posterior capsule. Biomechanical and molecular analyses, of contracted rabbit knee posterior capsule tissue after COX-2 inhibition revealed increased maximal passive extension and down-regulation of collagen messenger RNA compared with controls. Histopathologic examination suggested a trend of decreased quantities of dense fibrous connective tissue with COX-2 inhibition. These data may suggest that inhibiting the inflammatory cascade could potentially reduce pathologic myofibroblast activation, thereby reducing scar tissue formation and increasing the range of motion in arthrofibrotic joints. Implementing a multi-modal pharmacologic approach may simultaneously target numerous cellular components contributing to the complex process of arthrofibrogenesis. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - We present an atypical presentation of Ehrlichiosis induced sepsis requiring hemodialysis. Ehrlichiosis is a common tick-borne illness in Missouri, and in this case mimicks the course of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). A 48-year-old male with a history of marginal zone lymphoma had received radiation and chemotherapy with fludarabine. He was admitted to oncology service for evaluation of nausea and vomiting and generalized malaise. His initial laboratory data revealed platelet count 16,000?mm3, WBC 3,800?mm3, AST 327 units/L, ALT 185 units/L, BUN/Creatinine 53?mg/dl/3.8?mg/dl. Because the peripheral smear showed a morulae consistent with human granulocytic Ehrlichiosis, intravenous doxycycline 100?mg twice daily was initiated. Acute renal failure was thought due to hemodynamic changes, but the role of TTP remained in the differential diagnosis. On hospital day two, he became confused and lethargic and continued to be febrile. Hours later, he developed tonic-clonic seizures and became hypotensive. A clinical diagnosis of TTP was made. Peripheral smear showed only a few schistocytes, inconsistent with TTP. Microangiaopthic anemia, thrombocytopenia, sepsis with DIC, and multi-organ failure sustained the acute renal failure. Hemodialysis was used for ARF over the next several days in conjuction with IV doxycycline. The patient improved without plasmapharesis. Kidney function returned back to normal in due course of time. A final diagnosis of ehrlichia-induced sepsis with ARF was made. Conclusion:?Ehrlichiosis is endemic in Missouri and usually presents with thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver function tests; however it rarely presents with sepsis. The course of this case was made unusual possibly due to chemotherapy, fludarabine for the treatment of lymphoma, which can commonly cause micrangiopathic anemia, myelosuppression, and even a leukopenia for several years afterwards. This presentation mimicking TTP can be confusing but has previously been documented as a complication of severe Ehrlichiosis in the immunocompromised state.

AB  - Background One major concern in about one third of elder patients after total hip-replacement surgery is post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Previous studies have suggested that cognitive impairment is accompanied with changes in serum S-100? protein (S-100?) and inflammatory markers. Thus, the aim of the current study was to investigate the value of serum S-100? and interleukin(IL)-1?, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in reflecting POCD after total hip-replacement surgery. Methods Forty-two elderly patients were enrolled, and 37 patients completed the follow-up. Serum S-100? protein and IL-1?, IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP were determined pre-operatively, as well as 1?h and 6?h post-operatively. Neuropsychological tests were performed pre-operatively, as well as on day 1, 3, and 7 post-operatively. Results Seventeen (45.9%, 17/37) patients developed POCD 1?day after surgery, and three (8.1%, 3/37) developed POCD 7?days after surgery. [Correction added after publication 7 February 2012: in the preceding sentence (54.1%, 17/37) was corrected to (45.9%, 17/37)]. Patients with POCD 1?day after surgery had significantly higher serum levels of IL-6 at 6?h (135?±?32?pg/ml vs. 91?±?29?pg/ml, P?<?0.05) and S-100? at 1?h (1872?±?385?pg/ml vs. 1289?±?143?pg/ml, P?<?0.05. No significant post-operative change was detected in levels of TNF-α, IL-1, or CRP. Conclusion The serum levels of pro-inflammatory marker IL-6 and S-100? protein increased after total hip-replacement in elderly patients, and such increase may serve as predicting parameters for the occurrence of POCD.

AB  - Abstract Background? Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play a role in the repair and regeneration of the endothelium and may represent a novel cardiovascular risk factor. South Asian subjects have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease which is not fully explained by known risk factors. This study examined associations of EPCs with atherosclerosis and possible ethnic differences in EPCs. Materials and methods? A population sample of 58 European and South Asian adult men was enriched with the recruitment of an additional 59 European and South Asian men with known coronary disease. The coronary artery calcification score was measured by multi-slice computerized tomography (CT), carotid and femoral intima-media thickness (IMT), and femoral plaques were measured by ultrasound. The subjects were further subdivided into three categories of coronary artery disease on the basis of coronary artery calcification score and clinical history. Total EPCs and non-senescent EPCs (ns-EPCs) were quantified after 5 days cell culture and the number of late outgrowth colonies was measured over a 6-week test period. Circulating CD34+ haematopoietic precursor cells were measured by flow cytometry. Results? Individuals with femoral plaques had reduced total and ns-EPCs. The number of ns-EPCs were reduced in individuals with the most coronary atheroma and were inversely related to the coronary calcification score and femoral IMT. These relationships persisted after multivariate adjustment for other risk factors. The numbers of late outgrowth colonies or circulating CD34+ cells were unrelated to the presence of atherosclerosis. There were no differences in the number of EPCs between European and South Asian subjects. Conclusion? The number of EPCs are reduced in subjects with atherosclerosis independent of other risk factors. Reduction in EPC numbers may be an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis but does not explain ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk.
