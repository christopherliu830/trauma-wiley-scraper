AB  - Abstract Chromosomal aberrations were investigated in nuclei extracted from synovial tissue and first-passage synovial fibroblasts (P-1 SFB, 98% enrichment) or macrophages (P-1 M?) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 10). The findings were compared with those in other rheumatic diseases (osteoarthritis, n = 14; reactive arthritis, n = 1), as well as with those in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 8). Controls were paired peripheral blood lymphocytes from arthritic patients, synovial tissue or SFB/M? from joint trauma/normals (n = 9), and peripheral blood monocytes from normal donors (n = 10). GTG banding of metaphase chromosomes and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization with centromere-specific probes were used. Comparable chromosomal aberrations were observed in synovial tissue and P-1 SFB of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and reactive arthritis (polysomy 7 and aneusomies of chromosomes 4, 8, 9, 12, and 18). Notably, aneusomies of chromosomes 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and/or X were also detected in P-1 synovial M? from rheumatoid arthritis (90% of the cases), osteoarthritis (93%), and reactive arthritis (1/1), as well as bronchial M? from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (25%). No aberrations were detected in paired peripheral blood lymphocytes (except for one osteoarthritis case with a karyotype 45,X[10]/46,XX[17]), or in peripheral blood monocytes and synovial tissue of normals/joint trauma. Because M? aberrations were common to chronic joint and pulmonary disease, chronic inflammatory stress may induce chromosomal aberrations with potential functional relevance in local mesenchymal cells and infiltrating leukocytes in an organ-independent fashion. ? 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective.? Advanced complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) remains very difficult to treat. While subanesthetic low-dose ketamine has shown promise in early localized CRPS, its use in advanced CRPS has not been as effective. Since ketamine's analgesic potency and duration of effect in neuropathic pain are directly dose-dependant, we investigated the efficacy of ketamine in anesthetic dosage in refractory CRPS patients that had failed available standard therapies. Methods.? Twenty ASA I-III patients suffering from refractory CRPS received ketamine in anesthetic dosage over 5 days. Outcome criteria were pain relief, effect on the movement disorder, quality of life, and ability to work at baseline and up to 6 months following treatment. Results.? Significant pain relief was observed at 1, 3, and 6 months following treatment (93.5?±?11.1%, 89.4?±?17.0%, 79.3?±?25.3%; P?<?0.001). Complete remission from CRPS was observed at 1 month in all patients, at 3 months in 17, and at 6 months in 16 patients. If relapse occurred, significant pain relief was still attained at 3 and 6 months (59.0?±?14.7%, P?<?0.004; 50.2?±?10.6%, P?<?0.002). Quality of life, the associated movement disorder, and the ability to work significantly improved in the majority of patients at 3 and 6 months. Conclusions.? This open-label trial suggests benefit in pain reduction, associated CRPS symptoms, improved quality of life and ability to work following anesthetic ketamine in previously refractory CRPS patients. However, a randomized controlled trial will be necessary to prove its efficacy.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to review the history, clinical course, treatment, and outcome of movement disorders in children and young people with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Case notes were reviewed retrospectively of children and young people who presented with movement disorders in CRPS to our tertiary paediatric pain service over a period of 13 years. Ten children with CRPS presented with movement disorders (eight females, two males). The age at first presentation with symptoms of CRPS ranged from 8 to 15 years (mean 11y 2mo, median 13y). The most common movement disorder was dystonia (n=8), followed by tremors (n=3) and myoclonus (n=3); two patients had all three movement disorders. The movement disorder affected mainly the lower limb (n=9) with a predilection for the foot (n=7) and was frequently initiated by minor trauma (n=7). Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 14 years. The outcome was variable, with good prognosis in nearly half of the cases: four children experienced complete resolution of symptoms. Two children showed a slight improvement. Four children showed no improvement. Movement disorders in CRPS are under-recognized in children. The management has to be multidisciplinary with an expertize in paediatric pain.

AB  - Abstract Background The control of sepsis is the primary goal of surgical intervention in patients with infected necrosis. Simple surgical approaches that are easy to reproduce may improve outcomes when specialists in endoscopy are not available. The aim of the present study was to describe the experience with a focused open necrosectomy (FON) in patients with infected necrosis. Method A prospective pilot study conducted to compare a semi-open/closed drainage laparotomy and FON with the assistance of peri-operative ultrasound. The incidence of sepsis, dynamics of C-reactive protein (CRP), intensive care unit (ICU)/hospital stay, complication rate and mortality were compared and analysed. Results From a total of 58 patients, 36 patients underwent a conventional open necrosectomy and 22 patients underwent FON. The latter method resulted in a faster resolution of sepsis and a significant decrease in mean CRP on Day 3 after FON, P = 0.001. Post-operative bleeding was in 1 versus 7 patients and the incidence of intestinal and pancreatic fistula was 2 versus 8 patients when comparing FON to the conventional approach. The median ICU stay was 11.6 versus 23 days and the hospital stay was significantly shorter, 57 versus 72 days, P = 0.024 when comparing FON versus the conventional group. One patient died in the FON group and seven patients died in the laparotomy group, P = 0.139. Discussion FON can be an alternative method to conventional open necrosectomy in patients with infected necrosis and unresolved sepsis.

AB  - Daily hemodialysis greatly improves clinical and biochemical parameters and patient quality of life compared to conventional thrice weekly dialysis. However, mortality statistics are lacking as most centers providing daily dialysis have treated only a small number of relatively selected patients for relatively short observation times. To study patient survival we pooled experience from three sources: 51 French and 128 U.S. patients selected for daily home hemodialysis and 42 U.S. patients selected for short daily center hemodialysis because of many medical complications and cardiovascular instability. Results were compared to age-matched patients from the USRDS 2003 data base. The age of the patients was 51?±?16 (18?89) years; 29% were female; they had 3.3?±?1.8 comorbidities (twice that of USRDS patients); 32% had diabetes or hypertension as cause of renal disease (USRDS patients 70%); blood access was 61% fistulae, 25% grafts, and 14% CV-catheters. Mean duration of ESRD treatment at start of short daily hemodialysis was 6?±?7 years. The observation period was 315 patient years. Patients had been on daily hemodialysis for a mean of 17?±?18 (0?92) months and 11 patients were observed for more than 5 years. 35 of the 221 patients died (16%); deaths were 111 per 1,000 patient years (53% of expected) and 5-year cumulative survival was 63% compared to 32% for USRDS patients. Five-year survival was 0% in patients with >3 comorbidities, 75% in patients with <3 comorbidities (p?<?0.0001), and in patients aged <53 years was 80% vs. 50% in patients aged >53 years (p?=?0.0007). On Cox stepwise hazards analysis, comorbidity alone predicted survival when used with age. Comorbidity >3 HR?=?6.00 (95% CI 2.2?16.3). Conclusions: It is difficult to do survival comparisons between patient groups. However, these daily dialysis patients were age-matched with patients from the USRDS database. There were fewer diabetic and hypertensive patients but the comorbidity index was twice that of USRDS patients. Survival, both deaths per 1,000 patient years and cumulative count was approximately twice that reported by the USRDS and strongly suggests superior survival with short daily hemodialysis compared to thrice weekly conventional dialysis.

AB  - The Aksys PHD system is designed for short quotidian dialysis employing a 52-liter batch of ultrapure dialysate and up to 30 in situ hot water reuses of the entire extracorporeal circuit including a 40-liter physical cleaning before each dialysis. Methods:?We studied the effect of the 52-liter tank during 108 long 5?8 hour dialysis 3.5?6 times/week in 5 patients and one 50-liter patient simulator for 4 weeks. Phosphate (PO4), beta-2 microglobulin (b-2), urea (BUN), and creatinine (creat) were measured pre-, during, and post-dialysis 86 times and in total dialysate 74 times during long dialysis. Tank saturation, Kt/V, and monthly chemistries were also measured. Results:? Patient weight 76?±?2?kg, QB 234?±?23?ml/min, QD 498?±?13?ml/min. Dialysate was recirculated 4.8 times during 8 hours. Analyte Short Long dialysis p Pre-BUN ???70?±?18 ???49?±?15 <0.0001 Pre-creat ???12?±?3 ???10?±?2 <0.0002 Pre-PO4 ?5.2?±?1.5 ?4.1?±?1.1 <0.003 Pre-b-2 34.0?±?5.3 27.8?±?4.5 <0.0001 All patients on 8?hrs???5 dialyses/week stopped phosphate binders within 3 weeks. eKt/V(urea) rose to 0.5 in one hour and then slowly to 0.8 at 8 hours. Weekly stdKt/V: Dialyses/week/Hrs: 2 5 8 5 2.2 2.7 3.0 6 2.7 3.4 3.6 7 3.1 3.8 4.4 At 8?hrs the tank was 99?±?8% saturated with BUN, 86?±?12% with creat, 77?±?18% with PO4, and only 12?±?5% with b-2. Total removal per dialysis increased 2 gm BUN, 0.4?gm?creat, 0.4?gm PO4, and 40?mg?b-2. The decline per reuse in conductivity clearance was only 0.7?±?1.2% during short and 1.4?±?1.4% during long dialysis (p?=?0.11). There was no change in monthly chemistries or hematologies. Discussion:? The data show that the Aksys PHD is very effective for long 8-hour dialysis. The data for PO4 and b-2 are the same as reported for conventional dialysis machines using 5 times as much dialysate, and the weekly stdKt/V if the PHD is used every night is twice the standard defined by K/DOQI. The exceptional cleanliness and biocompatibility by way of the one-per-month reuse should be a great advantage to patients. The full automatization saves the patient one hour every night and 30 minutes every morning. The PHD also economizes on filters and dialysate and is good for the environment.

AB  - Decrease of HCV viral load and HGF plasma levels increase have been related to HD sessions. Beneficial effects of HGF stimulation in HD on the outcome of HCV liver disease have been described. Aim was to analyze potential differences between intermittent (3???week) and short daily (6???week) HD, examining differences between HCV+ and ? pts. We studied 41?pts from 2 HD centres, 26 on intermittent HD (6 on line HF), 8 HCV+, and 15 on short-daily HD with 4 HCV+ 40?pts used synthetic HD membranes (low-flux and high-flux). Among HCV?+?we determined viral load by Amplicor (Roche) pre- and post- HD. All pts were studied for HGF levels (ELISA) baseline, 15?min, end, and at start of the following session viral load is significantly higher preHD and decreases over session. High-flux membranes were more efficient in reducing viremia (67% vs 45%), which level was higher pre- and post-HD principally in patients using low-flux membranes. Viremia in DHD is lower than in intermittent (470067.3?±?663974.5 vs 1015695.5?±?1202679.0). HCV+ HCV? p HGF baseline 3261.3?±?1904.5 2186.5?±?815.7 0.01 HGF 15?min 8000.0?±?0.0 7774.0?±?1129.8 ns HGF end 6142.5?±?2262.3 4443.7?±?2515.7 0.03 HGF start 3391.0?±?1680.6 2311.7?±?633.6 0.007 HGF at baseline, at the end of the session, and starting the following one was significantly higher in HCV?+?patients. Maximum increase appears always at 15?min. HGF levels were significantly higher in daily HD than intermittent. Of the 14 patients who showed HGF after session higher than 8000, 8 were HCV+(3 in DHD, 5 high flux), 6 were HCV?(5 DHD and 3 high flux), 14?pts finished HD session with HGF>8000, 8HCV+(3 DHD, 5 high flux) and 6HCV?(5 DHD, 4 high-flux). HGF stimulation appears in daily and intermittent HD, with higher level in the latter; HCV+ showed higher HGF vs negative, independently from the HD frequency; HCV viral load diminishes in all HD sessions, more in those with high-flux membranes. Short-daily HD with high-flux synthetic membranes seems the best option for HCV+ patients, and when performed in home precludes nosocomial transmission.

AB  - Purpose:? Contamination of catheter hub connectors is known to cause catheter-related blood stream infections in patients undergoing hemodialysis via central venous catheters (CVC). The effectiveness of cleansing the hub with an antimicrobial agent was assessed by culturing the surface of the hub following sanitation. Methods:?The CVC hub connectors of 24 patients were sanitized using the standard hospital protocol of aseptically swabbing the connectors with a solution of bleach or Betadine, and then bathing the hub in sterile gauze soaked with the antimicrobial solution for 5 minutes. The exterior surface of the hub was then cultured for a broad spectrum of microorganisms. Patients were monitored for exit site infection, tunnel infection, and septicemia. In the laboratory, sterile hubs were inoculated with E. coli, staph. aureus neg., and yeast. Hubs were then immersed in Betadine for 5, 10, or 30?min. and cultures were taken. Results:?Positive cultures were obtained from the hubs of 17 of the 24 patients. Seven (7) of the patients with positive results developed bacteremia from the cultured organism within 7 weeks. Positive cultures were obtained from 50% of inoculated lab samples after 5?min, 10% after 15?min, and 0% after 30?min. of immersion sanitation. Conclusions:?The techniques for cleansing CVC hubs should be revisited.

AB  - The optimal acid base status for survival in maintenance hemo-dialysis (MHD) patients (pts) remains controversial. According to some reports acidosis is associated with improved survival in MHD pts, i.e., reverse epidemiology. We examined associations between baseline (first 3-month averaged) serum bicarbonate (HCO3), divided into 12 categories, and 2-yr mortality in 56,376 MHD pts across the US after controlling for confounding effects of malnutrition-inflammation complex syndrome (MICS). Three sets of Cox regression models were evaluated to estimate hazard ratios (HR) of death and 95% confidence intervals (CI): (1) Unadjusted; (2) Multivariate adjusted for case-mix (age, gender, diabetes, race, insurance, marital status, vintage, standardized mortality ratio, residual renal function, dialysate HCO3, and Kt/V); and (3) Additional adjustments for 8 markers of MICS (body mass index, serum albumin, creatinine, ferritin, TIBC, dietary protein intake, WBC and lymphocyte counts). See Figure for HR and 95% CI: We conclude that, although high HCO3 levels appear to be associated with increased mortality in MHD pts, this paradoxical effect is almost entirely due to the overwhelming impact of MICS on survival.
