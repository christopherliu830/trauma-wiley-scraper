AB  - To overcome problems of insufficient clearance, multiple dialyzers may be placed in series or in parallel. The present study aimed to investigate in vitro the overall clearance of small molecules in different dialyzer configurations in which mutual flow directions were changed. Single pass tests were performed with low flux Fresenius F6HPS dialyzers placed in series (12 tests), in parallel (6) and in single use (2). As blood substitute, either high concentrated (45?mS) bicarbonate dialysate (AB solution ? MW20-180) or a trisodiumphosphate (Na3PO4? MW395) concentration (30?mS) was used. Standard blood and dialysate flows of 250 and 500?mL/min, respectively, were applied. Furthermore, clearance was derived from conductivity measurements in the inlet and outlet bloodline, correcting for the overall ultrafiltration rate of 0.5?L/h (AB) and 0.1?L/h (Na3PO4). Compared to the standard setup using a single dialyzer with counter current flows, clearance increases by 3 to 8%(AB) and by 15 to 18%(Na3PO4) using two dialyzers in parallel and in series, respectively. With co-current flows in a serial dialyzer set up, clearance increases by 16%(AB) and 22%(Na3PO4) compared to the single dialyzer use. Changing subsequently the counter current flows to co-current in one and both dialyzers in series, the overall clearance decreases by 2 to 9%, respectively, for the AB solution, and by 8 to 15% for the Na3PO4 concentration. With respect to the parallel dialyzer setup, a split dialysate flow (250?mL/min in each dialyzer) counter current to the blood flow, increases the clearance by 4 and 12%, respectively. In conclusion, overall clearance is most ameliorated using two dialyzers in series with counter current flows.

AB  - Background:? Cardiac arrhythmias are considered as one of the most important causes of mortality in patients on hemodialysis. Arrhythmias frequently occur in patients with chronic renal failure on regular hemodialysis with reported incidences varying from 30?48% of patients. These abnormalities can span from supraventricular to severe ventricular arrhythmia. There is an increased frequency of occurrence and clustering of arrhythmias around the dialysis time. Aim of the study:?To detect the difference between acetate and bicarbonate dialysis as regard to the type and frequency of arrhythmia in those patients. Study design:?This study was done on 20 male patients age 51?73, all have history of heart disease. Patients were divided into 2 equal groups using acetate in group 1 and bicarbonate in group 2. All patients were on regular hemodialysis (4 hours, thrice weekly). Careful history and clinical examination were done. Pre-dialysis investigations included serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphorus, serum albumin, hemoglobin, and arterial blood gases. Post-dialysis serum potassium and arterial blood gases were measured. ECG and forty-eight hours ambulatory monitor (Holter monitor)(before, during, and after hemodialysis, till the end of the dialysis day and throughout the following day) were performed. Results:?Group 1 showed significantly less post-dialysis supraventricular arrhythmias than in dialysis day (210.9?±?236 and 62.3?±?14.4), respectively. Significantly less ventricular arrhythmias in post-dialysis than in dialysis day (30.7?±?50.4, and 106.2?±?128.4), respectively. While in Group 2 there were insignificant differences regarding supraventricular arrhythmias (21.9?±?28.9 and 16.6?±?36.3) and ventricular arrhythmias (22.9?+?7.8 and 29.6?+?12.8) in dialysis day than in post-dialysis day. There was significantly higher frequency of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in the dialysis day in acetate hemodialysis in comparison to bicarbonate hemodialysis. Conclusion:?Bicarbonate hemodialysis is less arrhythmogenic in comparison to acetate hemodialysis and has better effect on the blood pH and greater degree of base repletion. Continuous ambulatory ECG recording (Holter) is a useful tool in detecting arrhythmias in dialysis patients.

AB  - This study was designed to investigate the possible effect of dialyzer re-use on glucose hemostasis. Twenty patients with end stage renal failure (including ten non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus [NIDDM]) on thrice weekly hemodialysis (using glucose free dialysate), were studied by serial assessment of blood glucose, C-peptide, interleukin 1-B (IL-IB), Ca, Na and K at zero, 1 and 4 hours (end of dialysis) during hemodialysis on new, and then on re-used (first) cuprophane dialyzers. Our results showed significant rise of C-peptide, IL-1B with drop of blood glucose in first hour sample (and was symptomatic in some diabetics) in both groups when using new dialyzers but these changes were less marked and totally asymptomatic when using reprocessed dialyzers. In addition there was a significant positive correlation between IL-1B level and C-peptide at 1 and 4 hour samples and negative correlation between IL-1B and blood glucose at 1 and 4 hour samples. Conclusion: Through the effect of IL-1B on insulin release curophane dialyzers can affect glucose homeostasis especially in diabetics and hypoglycemia might be part of the first use syndrome. It may be recommended that measurement of glucose effect of dialysis membrane on glucose homeostasis might be an important parameter of membrane bioincompatibility.

AB  - The incidence of active tuberculosis among patients on long- term dialysis is higher than the rate in the general population. Case:?39-year-old male patient with ESRD was admitted to hospital with dyspnea, weight loss, cough without sputum and hemoptysis, and a palpable painless mass under the right areola. He was on maintenance hemodialysis three times a week for the last six months. PPD was negative. Chest X-ray examination revealed a hyperdense lesion. On the computerized tomography a cystic mass at the inferior lobe superior segment near the thorasic vertebra was detected. Fine needle aspiration from each of the mass lesions revealed granulomas and acido-resistant bacteria. Anti-tuberculous therapy was initiated. After eight months he came back with paraplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the lesion which previously has been described by CT was extending to the spinal duct and pressing on the spinal cord. After a biopsy, granuloma was seen; however, mycobacterium tuberculosis did not grow in the culture. Discussion:?Extrapulmonary tuberculosis is common in patients with ESRD. In the present case we established that the patient who presented a mass on the chest wall without pulmonary tuberculosis findings had indeed a tuberculous cavity mass. It is interesting to note that in this case this mass had no relationship to the tuberculous cavity in the lung tissue. Moreover, it is also interesting that paraspinal lesion occured during the period in which the patient was under treatment and it quickly progressed and led to paraplegia. Tissue biopsy with invasive procedures may be necessary. Thus, in areas with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, renal patients in high-risk group (renal transplant recipients, hemodialysis and CAPD patients) should be examined periodically to exclude silent infection and reduce morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Poor patient compliance is common during dialysis therapy. We aimed to study incidence of noncompliance, contributing factors, and effects on quality of life (QOL) among cadaveric renal transplantation waiting list patients. We included 86 renal transplantation waiting list patients (56M/30F). Dialysis duration, previous renal transplantation history, comorbid conditions, interdialytic weight gain, predialysis BUN, creatinine, potassium, and phosphate were recorded. Noncompliance criteria were skipping >1 dialysis session or shortening a dialysis session>10?min in 1 month, interdialytic weight gain>5.7% of body weight, predialysis serum potassium >6?mEq/L, and phosphate level >7.5?mg/dl. There were 49 noncompliant (age: 46.8?±?21.8 years, HD duration: 83.9?±?48.7 months) and 37 compliant (age: 42.8?±?12.1 years, HD duration: 96.5?±?45.2 months) patients. QOL was evaluated by short form 36 and depression levels by Beck Depression Inventory. Previous renal transplantation was present in 24.4% and comorbid diseases in 31.3% of all patients. In depressed patients, 77.8% had comorbid diseases. No difference was found between the groups considering age, gender, dialysis duration, previous transplantation history, and comorbid diseases (p?>?0.05). Noncompliant patients had lower QOL (p?<?0.04). Noncompliant patients had higher degree of depression (p?=?0.01). QOL and Beck scores were negatively correlated (p?=?0.001, r?=??0.561). Noncompliance to diet and dialysis therapy is associated with depression, which further decreases QOL in renal transplantation waiting list patients. Early diagnosis of depression, is possible by monitoring noncompliance, and therapeutic intervention may benefit during the transplantation-waiting period.

AB  - Summary Innate immunity is fundamental to our defense against microorganisms. Physiologically, the intravascular innate immune system acts as a purging system that identifies and removes foreign substances leading to thromboinflammatory responses, tissue remodeling, and repair. It is also a key contributor to the adverse effects observed in many diseases and therapies involving biomaterials and therapeutic cells/organs. The intravascular innate immune system consists of the cascade systems of the blood (the complement, contact, coagulation, and fibrinolytic systems), the blood cells (polymorphonuclear cells, monocytes, platelets), and the endothelial cell lining of the vessels. Activation of the intravascular innate immune system in vivo leads to thromboinflammation that can be activated by several of the system's pathways and that initiates repair after tissue damage and leads to adverse reactions in several disorders and treatment modalities. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge in the field and discuss the obstacles that exist in order to study the cross-talk between the components of the intravascular innate immune system. These include the use of purified in vitro systems, animal models and various types of anticoagulants. In order to avoid some of these obstacles we have developed specialized human whole blood models that allow investigation of the cross-talk between the various cascade systems and the blood cells. We in particular stress that platelets are involved in these interactions and that the lectin pathway of the complement system is an emerging part of innate immunity that interacts with the contact/coagulation system. Understanding the resulting thromboinflammation will allow development of new therapeutic modalities.

AB  - Background:? Central venous stenosis in chronic hemodialysis patients occurs in about 17% of all venous stenosis and it is associated with central vein catheterization. We evaluated the effect of percutaneous angioplasty and stenting in the treatment of central venous stenosis in hemodialysis patients. Methods:?We retrospectively investigated the medical records of a total of 31 dialysis patients who had central venous stenosis. We reviewed the causes of central venous stenosis, clinical manifestations, venographic findings, and patency rate of radiological intervention. Results:?Of the total 31 patients, 28 patients had past history of central vein catheterization ipsilateral to vascular access. Mean duration of the catheterization was 32?±?14 days. Venography showed complete obstruction of central vein (n?=?14) and stenosis (n?=?17). The site of venous lesion was right subclavian vein (n?=?11), innominate vein (n?=?9), left subclavian vein (n?=?7), and superior vena cava (n?=?14). A total of 30 procedures of angioplasty with or without stenting were performed in 26 of 31 patients. Initial success rate was 96.1% and there was no severe complication such as rupture or bleeding. The primary patency rate at 6, 12, 24, and 48 months after the procedure was 87.3%, 75.6%, 67.9%, and 65.4%, respectively. The cumulative patency rate at the same time point was 96.0%, 90.6%, 74.0%, and 72.8%, respectively. Conclusion:?Our data suggest that angioplasty with or without stenting is safe and effective in the treatment of central venous stenosis in hemodialysis patients.

AB  - Objective: To report outcome in dogs after internal fixation of a sarcoma-related pathologic fracture of the appendicular skeleton. Study Design: Multi-institutional case series. Animals: Dogs (n=16). Methods: Medical records of participating VSSO members were reviewed for dogs with pathologic fracture associated with a confirmed bone sarcoma of the appendicular skeleton repaired by external or internal fixation. Dogs were included if they had a histological diagnosis of osteosarcoma or sarcoma and excluded if they had radiation before fracture. Data collected were analyzed for signalment, fracture location, staging performed, method of fracture fixation, histopathology, adjunctive treatment and outcome. Results: Signalment and fracture location of 16 dogs that met the inclusion criteria was similar to dogs with appendicular OSA without fracture. One of 14 dogs had pulmonary metastasis and 3 of 5 dogs had bone metastasis. Bone plate or interlocking nail were used for repair in 12 dogs. Limb use immediately after surgery in 13 dogs was good (4), weight-bearing but lame (7) and non-weight bearing (2). Adjunctive therapy was administered in 5 dogs (chemotherapy, 3; radiation, 4; pamidronate, 3). Survival time ranged from 18 to 897 days; median survival was 166 days. Conclusions: Repair of pathologic fracture can result in palliation and prolonged survival.

AB  - The increase in number of obese people seen in the general population, is also what is seen in the hemodialyzed population. It is generally believed that the location of deep forearm vessels in the subcutaneous fat tissue makes primary arteriovenous fistula (AVF) a disadvantage because of difficulties in vessel puncturing. For obese patients, it is suggested that a fistula with PTFE is created or a central catheter inserted, but these solutions increase already high morbidity rate and significantly increase mortality rate. Methods:?The deep location of veins situated on the anterior part of the forearm involved 57 patients (45 female and 12 male) aged 13?87 years (mean 67?±?15.2 years). Patients? body mass index (BMI) ranged from 29.1 to 53.73 (mean 34.6?±?7.8). The causes of the renal failure were diabetic nephropathy in 30 patients, chronic glomerulonephritis in 4, hypertensive nephrosclerosis in 5, lupus nephritis in 2, interstitial nephritis in 4, primary amyloidosis in 1, polycystic kidney disease in 3, and unknown in 3 patients.Two-step surgical procedure was performed in all patients. In the first stage, the standard distal radiocephalic AVF in the wrist region was created. In case of its failure, the next attempt was performed above the point of the first intervention. In the second stage, superficialization of the venous part of AVF was performed in the mode described by us (Kidney 2002;.1:1170). Results:?The first stage of the procedure was successful in 46 patients. In 6 cases it was necessary to perform a second attempt, and 2 cases required three operations. The second stage was undertaken in all of these patients (n?=?54), and complete success was achieved in 51. In 3 cases, in spite of superficialization, AVF was not suitable for puncturing because of poor blood flow. The causes of failure of the first stage procedure in 2 patients were severe arteriosclerosis and venous anomaly. All patients had non-altered cephalic veins in the wrist region, as opposed to patients with cannulated veins. In 51?pts (90%) an efficient flow of the blood through AVF was successfully obtained and allowed satisfactory dialyses. Conclusions:?The primary AVF creation on the forearm is feasible in 90% of obese patients. This result is similar to the general population of chronic renal disease patients of our center (95%)(NDT 1998;13:527) and is possible thanks to the location of the veins deep in the subcutaneous fat tissue, which protects against repeated cannulation and hence mechanical destruction in the pre-dialysis period.

AB  - Abstract Chromosomal aberrations were investigated in nuclei extracted from synovial tissue and first-passage synovial fibroblasts (P-1 SFB, 98% enrichment) or macrophages (P-1 M?) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 10). The findings were compared with those in other rheumatic diseases (osteoarthritis, n = 14; reactive arthritis, n = 1), as well as with those in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 8). Controls were paired peripheral blood lymphocytes from arthritic patients, synovial tissue or SFB/M? from joint trauma/normals (n = 9), and peripheral blood monocytes from normal donors (n = 10). GTG banding of metaphase chromosomes and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization with centromere-specific probes were used. Comparable chromosomal aberrations were observed in synovial tissue and P-1 SFB of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and reactive arthritis (polysomy 7 and aneusomies of chromosomes 4, 8, 9, 12, and 18). Notably, aneusomies of chromosomes 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and/or X were also detected in P-1 synovial M? from rheumatoid arthritis (90% of the cases), osteoarthritis (93%), and reactive arthritis (1/1), as well as bronchial M? from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (25%). No aberrations were detected in paired peripheral blood lymphocytes (except for one osteoarthritis case with a karyotype 45,X[10]/46,XX[17]), or in peripheral blood monocytes and synovial tissue of normals/joint trauma. Because M? aberrations were common to chronic joint and pulmonary disease, chronic inflammatory stress may induce chromosomal aberrations with potential functional relevance in local mesenchymal cells and infiltrating leukocytes in an organ-independent fashion. ? 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background:? The incidence of infection in patients on chronic hemodialysis in higher than that of the general population. Infection is known to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. The vascular access is important for hemodialysis, but infection through this route is the most common source of bacteremia and can be lethal to the patients. Despite the high morbidity and mortality of bacteremia in patients on chronic hemodialysis, the clinical characteristics of bacteremia in hemodialysis patients is rarely reported yet in Korea. Methods:?We included 696 hemodialysis patients from January 1993 to December 2003 at Uijongbu St. Mary's Hospital. We investigated incidence, source, causative organisms, clinical manifestations, complication, and mortality of bacteremia. We compared clinical factors, morbidity, and mortality between arteriovenous fistula and central venous catheter groups. Results:?Total 52 cases of bacteremia occurred in 43 patients. The major source of infection was vascular access (48%). Staphylococcus aureus was most common organism isolated. Major complications were septic shock (9.6%), pneumonia (9.6%), infective endocarditis (3.8%), and aortic pseudoaneurysm (1.9%). Nine patients died from septic shock (n?=?4), aspiration pneumonia (n?=?2), hypoxic brain injury (n?=?1), gastrointestinal bleeding (n?=?1), and rupture of aortic pseudoaneurysm. The central venous catheter group (n?=?22) had higher incidences of vascular access as a source of infection (81.8% vs 23.3%, p?<?0.001) and staphylococcus as a causative organism (77.2% vs 50.0%, p?=?0.042) than the arteriovenous group. Conclusion:? This data shows that bacteremia causes high incidence of fatal complications and mortality. Therefore, careful management of vascular access as well as early detection of bacteremia is an important factor for the prevention of infection and proper antibiotic therapy should be started early.

AB  - Background:? Because of high incidence of acquired renal cyst and renal malignancy, it is suggested that spontaneous renal rupture more frequently occurs in patients receiving long-term hemodialysis than in the general population. This study was performed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of spontaneous renal rupture in hemodialysis patients. Methods:?This retrospective study enrolled 12 hemodialysis patients who developed spontaneous renal rupture. We investigated primary renal disease, duration of dialysis, clinical symptoms and signs, radiologic findings, treatment modalities, and histologic findings. Result:?The mean age of the patients was 54?±?10 years old and the number of male was 9. Primary renal disease consisted of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PCKD)(n?=?5), chronic glomerulonephritis (n?=?2), diabetic nephropathy (n?=?1), hypertensive nephropathy (n?=?1), unknown cause (n?=?3). Presenting symptoms and signs were sudden onset of flank pain in 9 patients and gross hematuria with mild flank pain in 3 patients. Mean duration from initiation of hemodialysis to development of spontaneous renal rupture was 53?±?36 months. Abdominal computed tomography showed subcapsular or perinephric hematoma in all patients. Of the 7 non-PCKD patients, 6 patients had multiple acquired renal cysts. Surgical exploration was undertaken in 9 patients. Pathologic examination demonstrated small sized renal cell carcinoma in 2 of 9 patients. Three patients were only treated with conservative management including blood transfusion. All 12 patients recovered without recurrence. Conclusion:?This study demonstrated that genetic or acquired renal cyst was an important cause of spontaneous renal rupture in hemodialysis patients and presenting manifestations were sudden onset of flank pain and gross hematuria.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective.? Advanced complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) remains very difficult to treat. While subanesthetic low-dose ketamine has shown promise in early localized CRPS, its use in advanced CRPS has not been as effective. Since ketamine's analgesic potency and duration of effect in neuropathic pain are directly dose-dependant, we investigated the efficacy of ketamine in anesthetic dosage in refractory CRPS patients that had failed available standard therapies. Methods.? Twenty ASA I-III patients suffering from refractory CRPS received ketamine in anesthetic dosage over 5 days. Outcome criteria were pain relief, effect on the movement disorder, quality of life, and ability to work at baseline and up to 6 months following treatment. Results.? Significant pain relief was observed at 1, 3, and 6 months following treatment (93.5?±?11.1%, 89.4?±?17.0%, 79.3?±?25.3%; P?<?0.001). Complete remission from CRPS was observed at 1 month in all patients, at 3 months in 17, and at 6 months in 16 patients. If relapse occurred, significant pain relief was still attained at 3 and 6 months (59.0?±?14.7%, P?<?0.004; 50.2?±?10.6%, P?<?0.002). Quality of life, the associated movement disorder, and the ability to work significantly improved in the majority of patients at 3 and 6 months. Conclusions.? This open-label trial suggests benefit in pain reduction, associated CRPS symptoms, improved quality of life and ability to work following anesthetic ketamine in previously refractory CRPS patients. However, a randomized controlled trial will be necessary to prove its efficacy.

AB  - Objective:? We have reported that intimal hyperplasia, which is the pathologic change of the radial artery, is associated with early failure of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in hemodialysis (HD) patients (Am J Kidney Dis, 41:422?428, 2003). Intima-media thickness (IMT), which represents the whole thickness of arterial wall, can be easily measured by ultrasonography, unlike intima thickness. This study was performed to investigate the impact of IMT of radial artery on early failure of AVF in HD patients. Methods:?Ninety HD patients undergoing radiocephalic AVF operation were included in this study. The AVF was constructed in an end vein?to?side artery fashion at the wrist by one vascular surgeon. During the operation, 10-mm long partial arterial walls were removed with elliptical form for microscopic analysis. Specimens were stained with trichrome and examined by a pathologist blinded to the clinical data. AVF patency was prospectively followed up for 1 year after the operation. Results:?Mean age of the patients was 56?±?13 years and the number of females was 44 (48.9%). Mean IMT was 430?± 132??m (133?760??m). Of the total 90 patients, 31 patients (34.4%) had AVF failure within 1 year after the operation. Mean IMT was higher in the failed group (n?=?31) than in patent group (n?=?59)(486?±?130??m vs. 330?±?178??m, p?=?0.004). Using a threshold of 500??m of IMT, AVF patency rate was compared between these two groups using Kaplan-Meier method with log rank test. The AVF patency rate within 1 year after the operation was higher in patients with IMT?≥?500??m (n?=?26) than in patients with IMT?<?500??m (n?=?64)(p?<?0.001). The patients with IMT?≥?500??m were older and had higher incidence of diabetes mellitus, compared to the patients with IMT?<?500??m. There was no difference in sex, smoking, hypertension, total cholesterol and albumin levels between the two groups. Conclusion:?Our data suggest that increased intima-media thickness of radial artery is associated with early failure of radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula in hemodialysis patients.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to review the history, clinical course, treatment, and outcome of movement disorders in children and young people with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Case notes were reviewed retrospectively of children and young people who presented with movement disorders in CRPS to our tertiary paediatric pain service over a period of 13 years. Ten children with CRPS presented with movement disorders (eight females, two males). The age at first presentation with symptoms of CRPS ranged from 8 to 15 years (mean 11y 2mo, median 13y). The most common movement disorder was dystonia (n=8), followed by tremors (n=3) and myoclonus (n=3); two patients had all three movement disorders. The movement disorder affected mainly the lower limb (n=9) with a predilection for the foot (n=7) and was frequently initiated by minor trauma (n=7). Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 14 years. The outcome was variable, with good prognosis in nearly half of the cases: four children experienced complete resolution of symptoms. Two children showed a slight improvement. Four children showed no improvement. Movement disorders in CRPS are under-recognized in children. The management has to be multidisciplinary with an expertize in paediatric pain.
