AB  - Purpose:? This study evaluated improvements in dialyzer reuse parameters and clinical outcomes associated with a CQI project in a hospital-based dialysis center in which high flux polysulfone dialyzers were replaced with high flux Polyflux? dialyzers (GAMBRO? Renal Products). Methods:?Dialyzers were reprocessed using a Renatron? II Dialyzer Reprocessing System in conjunction with Renalin? sterilant (Minntech Corp.). Renalog? RM software was used to track dialyzer reprocessing rates and failures. Reasons for dialyzer failure included inadequate dialyzer volume; excess pressure; appearance; clotting during use; and maximum number of uses reached. The average number of dialyzer reuses with polysulfone dialyzers between January and June 2002 were compared to that achieved with Polyflux? dialyzers for the same periods in 2003 and 2004. Analysis periods were separated to avoid the impact of dialyzer transition on clinical parameters. Achievement of URR goals during these same periods was likewise compared. Results:?Transition from polysulfone to Polyflux? dialyzers was associated with a >40% increase in average number of reuses between 2002 and 2003 and a >63% increase comparing the 2002 and 2004 periods. During the 2002 analysis period with polysulfone dialyzers the target URR of 65% was achieved in approximately 75% of hemodialysis patients; this increased to nearly 95% with Polyflux? dialyzers in both the 2003 and 2004 periods, despite more reprocessing of these dialyzers. Conclusions:?These results demonstrate an improvement in both reuse efficiency and clinical outcomes associated with Polyflux dialyzers. Identifying clinical products through CQI studies that provide an economic and clinical advantage plays an important role in the success of hospital-based hemodialysis.

AB  - Abstract Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a disabling pain condition with sensory, motor and autonomic manifestations. Uncertainty remains about how CRPS can be effectively managed. We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for treatment and prophylactic interventions for CRPS published during the period 2000?2012, building on previous work by another group reviewing the period 1966?2000. Bibliographic database searches identified 173 papers which were filtered by three reviewers. This process generated 29 trials suitable for further analysis, each of which was reviewed and scored by two independent reviewers for methodological quality using a 15-item checklist. A number of novel and potentially effective treatments were investigated. Analysing the results from both review periods in combination, there was a steep rise in the number of published RCTs per review decade. There is evidence for the efficacy of 10 treatments (3? strong ? bisphosphonates, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and graded motor imagery, 1? moderate and 6? limited evidence), and against the efficacy of 15 treatments (1? strong, 1? moderate and ?13 limited). The heterogeneity of trialled interventions and the pilot nature of many trials militate against drawing clear conclusions about the clinical usefulness of most interventions. This and the observed phenomenon of excellent responses in CRPS subgroups would support the case for a network- and multi-centre approach in the conduct of future clinical trials. Most published trials in CRPS are small with a short follow-up period, although several novel interventions investigated from 2000 to 2012 appear promising.

AB  - Scanty data suggests that large solutes show a kinetic behavior that is different from urea. The question investigated in this study is whether other small water-soluble solutes such as some guanidino compounds show a kinetic behavior comparable or dissimilar to that of urea. This study included 7 stable conventional hemodialysis patients without residual diuresis undergoing low flux polysulphone dialysis (F8 and F10HPS). Blood samples were collected from the inlet and outlet blood lines before the dialysis session, after 5, 15, 30, 120 minutes, and immediately after discontinuation of the session. Plasma concentrations of urea, creatinine (CTN), creatine (CT), guanidinosuccinic acid (GSA), guanidinoacetic acid (GAA), guanidine (G), and methylguanidine (MG) were used to calculate corresponding dialyzer clearances. A two-pool kinetic model was fitted to the measured plasma concentration profiles, resulting in the calculation of the perfused volume (V1), the total distribution volume (Vtot), and the inter-compartmental clearance (K12); solute generation and ultrafiltration were determined independently. No significant differences were observed between V1 and K12 for urea (6.4?±?3.3?L and 822?±?345?mL/min) and for the guanidino compounds. However, with respect to Vtot, GSA was distributed in a smaller volume (30.6?±?4.2?L) compared to urea (42.7?±?6.0?L???P?<?0.001), while CTN, CT, GAA, G, and MG showed significantly larger volumes (54.0?±?5.9?L, 98.0?±?52.3?L, 123.8?±?66.9?L, 89.7?±?21.4?L, and 102.6?±?33.9?L, respectively). These differences resulted in markedly divergent effective solute removal: 67%(urea), 58%(CTN), 42%(CT), 76%(GSA), 37%(GAA), 43%(G), and 42%(MG). In conclusion, the kinetics of the guanidino compounds under study are different from that of urea; hence, urea kinetics are not representative for the removal of other uremic solutes, even if they are small and water-soluble like urea.

AB  - One of the basic symptoms of a terminal stage chronic renal insufficiency is anemia. From everything, used methods of correction of an anemia, it is considered the most effective application of preparations recombinant human erythropoietin (r-Hu EPO). Since 1994 in the Scientific Centre of Surgery begins application r-Hu EPO. Application r-Hu EPO in patients with a terminal stage chronic renal insufficiency in 90?95% of cases had a positive effect, but 5?10% of patients have intolerance to erythropoietin, that has induced to search of new effective methods of correction of anemia. During research were determined quantity erythrocytes, hemoglobin, reticulocyte in peripheral blood and acid-alkaline condition of blood. All hematology parameters were defined at the beginning of treatment, over 5 day and for 15 day of stimulation of a bone marrow. For 15 days after stimulation of a bone marrow by the laser there was an authentic increase of quantity erythrocyte, hemoglobin, hematocrit. The initial contents erythrocytes made 2.22?±?0.1 10???12, hemoglobin 67.7?±?3.2?g/l and hematocrit 18.2?±?1.2%. During treatment by the laser parameters erythrocytes have increased up to 2.9?±?0.8 10???12, hemoglobin up to 89.6?±?2.9?g/l and hematocrit up to 28.2?±?1.3%(P?<?0,005).

AB  - Background:? Insulin resistance has been associated with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, central obesity, and dyslipidemia, all of which are important risk factors for progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). A greater degree of insulin resistance may predispose to renal injury by worsening renal hemodynamics through the elevation of glomerular filtration fraction. However, there are sparse data on the relationship between insulin resistance, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and total body fat or phase angle in CKD without diabetes. Methods:?We examined 84 non-diabetes CKD patients according to the K/DOQI definitions; only 79 patients were enrolled into the study (GFR between 15 and 90?ml/min/1.73?m2). The value of insulin resistance was obtained by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). Bioelectrical impedance analysis was performed to determine the percentage of total body fat or phase angle. GFR was calculated by the average of creatinine and urea clearances. Results:?The correlation analysis showed that HOMA-insulin resistance was positively correlated with phase angle (r?=?0.35, P?<?0.01), percentage of total body fat (r?=?0.27, P?<?0.01), body mass index (r?=?0.48, P?<?0.01) and serum triglyceride levels (r?=?0.32, P?<?0.01), but not significantly correlated with gender (r?=??0.07, P?>?0.05), age (r?=?0.05, P?>?0.05), GFR (r?=??0.006, P?>?0.05), and mean arterial blood pressure (r?=?0.11, P?>?0.05). Conclusion:?In non-diabetic chronic kidney disease patients, the major risk factor for insulin resistance is the amount of total body fat. The insulin level is not dependent on the GFR in these patients.

AB  - Regulation of phosphate (PO4) in hemodialysis patients is very difficult and ideal levels are rarely maintained. A high removal and a normal phosphate level is important, as high and low levels are both associated with morbidity and a very high mortality. We studied phosphate dynamics and its relation to other small ?uremic? molecules in 48 patients by measuring pre- and postdialysis levels and all removed phosphate, urea and creatinine (creat) in all dialysate during 455 dialyses done at different frequencies (freq): 3.7?±?1.2, range 3?6 treatments per week and durations of dialysis (t): mean: 196?±?95, range 80?560?min and with high (HF) and low flux membranes. Kt/V-PO4, Kt/V-urea and Kt/V-creat, volumes (Vr) for all solutes and their relationships to frequency and duration of dialysis, urea clearance and predialysis phosphate were calculated. Factor/solute: PO4 Urea-N Creatinine Predialysis mg/dl 5.7?±?1.9 73?±?24 12?±?3 Postdialysis mg/dl 3.0?±?1.0 33?±?15 6?±?2 100???Vr/BW 63?±?78 58?±?24 41?±?15 Kt/V 1.01?±?0.66 1.04?±?0.32 0.97?±?0.26 Weekly stdKt/V 1.75?±?0.81 2.12?±?0.68 1.96?±?0.71 Removed gm/week 3.1?±?1.3 56?±?23 6.2?±?2.5 Vr?=?removed solute?÷?(predialysis minus postdialysis concentration.); BW?=?body weight. Uf?=?ultrafiltration. Results: Vr as a percentage of BW for PO4 was dependent on predialysis PO4 and rose steeply as predialysis PO4 decreased: Vr% BW?=?212???88???ln (predialysis PO4), (r?=?0.39, p?<?0.0001). There was no such relationship for Vr for urea or creatinine and no relation between urea and PO4 Vr, (r?=?0.07, p?=?0.141). In stepwise multiple regression analysis: Mg PO4 removed per week?=?t???6.5?+?freq???387?+?Uf???140?+?pre-PO4???273?+?PO4 stdKt/V???343???HF???375???1824, (r?=?0.73, p?<?0.0001). Blood flow(QB) and dialysate flow (QD), urea weekly stdKt/V were not significant variables in the model. Pre-dialysis PO4?=?6.8???Hrs/week???0.07???QB???0.003?+?Uf??? 0.26. QD, membrane type or dialyses/week did not enter the model. Only patients dialyzing>28 hrs/week could stop phosphate binders within 3 weeks. Conclusions:?Phosphate shows a highly variable dynamic during dialysis. Apparently, the body maintains extracellular PO4 concentration by releasing PO4 from unknown compartments when the blood concentration of PO4 decreases. Vr for phosphate thus varies not only from patient to patient but also in a patient, depending on blood concentration of PO4. Kt/V for urea and creatinine are inaccurate in describing PO4 removal. To remove PO4 efficiently it is most important to use long and daily dialysis. QB, QD and membrane type are relatively unimportant in phosphate removal.

AB  - Tunneled-cuffed hemodialysis catheters are frequently used as long-term vascular access in children due to the technical difficulties in constructing a fistula. Catheter-related bacteremia (CRB) is still a major complication contributing to patient morbidity and loss of vascular access. Objective:?To investigate the microbiological characteristics of CRB in children on hemodialysis. Methods:?Chart review of 63 children who received hemodialysis with a tunneled-cuffed catheter between January 1999 and December 2003 was performed. CRB was diagnosed when positive blood cultures were obtained in patients with symptoms of bacteremia, and without an identifiable source. Results:?During the 5 year period, a total of 251 CRB were detected with 313 bacterial and 2 candidal growths in the blood cultures. The distribution of gram positive (Gr+) and gram negative (Gr?) microorganisms and their sensitivity patterns are shown in the table. Coagulase negative Staphylococcus was the most common microorganism, and constituted 62% of all bacterial isolates. All Gr+ microorganisms were sensitive to vancomycin except one isolate of Enterococcus fecalis. Enterobacter cloacae was the most common Gr? microorganism, followed by Klebsiella pneumonia. The sensitivity of Gr? microorganisms to levofloxacin was 100%. The treatment course was complicated by the growth of a second microorganism in subsequent blood cultures in 24% of infections; 54% of these consisted of both Gr+ and Gr? isolates. The etiology of ESRD or the use of immunosuppressive agents had no effect on the occurrence of CRB. The average number of infections were 5.8/1000 catheter days, and the recurrence of CRB was more likely in patients who had two or more CRB in a year. 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Gr+ growth 80% 88% 87% 85% 73% Oxacillin resistance 84% 73% 82% 68% 75% Gr? growth 20% 12% 13% 15% 27% Tobramycin resistance 21% 50% 25% 20% 13% Conclusions: Empiric initial treatment for CRB should include both Gr+, and Gr? coverage. Oxacillin and first generation cephalosporins are not good choices due to high incidence of resistance. Levofloxacin is a good alternative for Gr CRB. Novel preventive measures should be sought in patients who have a tendency to have recurrent CRB.

AB  - Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis and vasculopathy of the skin and visceral organs. Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), the most acute and life threatening complication, occurs in 10?20% of adult patients with SSc and has not been reported in children. A 10-year-old girl was diagnosed with SSc when she presented with weakness and skin thickening. She had positive ANA and anti-Scl 70. Renal function, urinalysis, and blood pressure were normal. She was treated with steroids, penicillamin and methotrexate as well as amlodipine for Raynaud's phenomenon, but her diffuse skin thickening and contractures progressed and she became wheelchair bound and had poor growth despite nutrition through a G-tube. At age 15 (weight 28?kg), when evaluated for abdominal pain, she was found to have acute renal failure (BUN 54?mg/dl, creatinine 2.2?mg/dl) and hypertension. Despite therapy with enalapril, serum creatinine continued to rise and she became oligoanuric, requiring initiation of hemodialysis. BP was controlled with enalapril and dialysis but she remained dialysis dependent. Steroid therapy was discontinued and replaced by low dose cyclosporine. Enalapril was replaced by losartan because of leukopenia and BP remained normal. Over the next 2 years, she was treated with hemodialysis and did not experience any complications. She progressively had an outstanding overall clinical improvement, marked skin softening, and was able to walk independently. Renal function did not improve. 28 months after the SRC, she received LRD renal transplant. Immunosuppression included cyclosporine, mycophenolate and prednisone. Creatinine 2 months post-transplant is 0.7?mg/dl. SRC in children may progress to end-stage renal disease but can be treated successfully with dialysis and transplantation without significant complications.

AB  - Purpose:? Tunneled catheters as chronic dialysis access is a reality of chronic hemodialysis. Infection of the catheter is an unavoidable complication. We researched the possibility of using Na Citrate as capping because of its anticoagulant effects and bactericidal properties. Methods:?Rate of infections per 1000 calendar days with heparin capping was recorded for an eight month period before using Na Citrate. Flows <300?ml/min via catheters were also recorded for an eight month period before Na Citrate use, using treatments per 1000 calendar days. Both these parameters were recorded for an eight month period following the initiation of Na Citrate 4% for all catheters. Results:?Our infection rate using heparin was 2.2 infections per 1000 catheter days. Infection rate after use of Na citrate was 1.2 infections per 1000 calendar days. Catheter flows <300 were 5.6 per 1000 calendar days using heparin, and 9.2 per 1000 calendar days after use of Na Citrate. There were no reactions related to Na Citrate, and no symptomatic hypocalcemia. Conclusions:?Na Citrate is effective at reducing the number of infections when used as a capping solution for tunneled catheters. Na Citrate?capped catheters had more frequent declines in QB compared with heparin capping. Because of the availability of anti-thrombolytic agents to preserve catheter patency, Na Citrate makes a safe option as a capping agent for long-term catheter capping.

AB  - Currently there is no published data using the Cannon catheter. Our purpose was to confirm adequacy of hemodialysis using the Arrow Cannon catheter. This retrospective study used patients from one nephrology practice, utilizing two dialysis centers. All patients in a two year period meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria referred for tunneled catheter placement were included. All catheters were placed by interventional nephrologist using ultrasound for vein cannulation and fluoroscopy for placement confirmation. Pump speed (Qb), venous and arterial pressures, Kt/V, urea reduction ratio (URR), and dialysis prescriptions/adherence to the prescription were reviewed at baseline and monthly for six months. Catheter removal or six months were the study endpoints. Complications were evaluated from time of insertion throughout the study period. 38 patients were enrolled in the study. All patients were treated in the outpatient setting. Insertion outcome was successful in all 38 patients. The average dialysis prescription was approximately 400?ml/min, 3.7 hours, and 3 days a week. The mean average pump speed for all months evaluated exceeded the K/DOQI guideline of 300?ml/min. by 67.9?101.4?ml/min. The differences were significant with p?<?0.01. The mean Kt/V and URR% data for each month evaluated exceeded the K/DOQI guideline values of 1.2 for Kt/V and 63% for URR% by between .34?.24 and 8%?10%, respectively; the differences were all at a significant level with p?<?0.01. Mean arterial pressures for all months evaluated ranged from ?218.6 to ?238.1, and venous pressures averaged between 179.8 to 213.7. Only three patients experienced late complications (all of which were infections) and no patients required hospitalization post complication. Two were bacteremic; the other had tunnel infection without positive blood cultures. This is the first retrospective study to evaluate the adequacy of hemodialysis with the Cannon catheter. Our study showed that flow rates and adequacy of hemodialysis can be reached using the Cannon catheter, with minimal complications.

AB  - Objective:? Hemodialysis (HD), hemofiltration (HF), hemodiafiltration (HDF), and acetate free biofiltration (AFB) are renal replacement therapy (RRT) methods in which impurities are removed from the blood extracorporeally. It has been suggested that HF, HDF, and AFB may have fewer cardiovascular side-effects than HD and may reduce incidence of dialysis-related amyloid- associated complications due to more effective removal of ?2-microglobulin. Methods:?We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing these RRT modalities. Out of 1672 abstracts identified by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry, 18 trials (588 patients) were included. Our comparisons were convective modalities (HF/HDF/AFB) vs HD (16 trials); HDF/AFB vs HF (no trials); and HDF vs AFB (2 trials). Data were extracted by two reviewers independently on mortality, hypotension episodes, dialysis sessions associated with ?adverse symptoms?(headache, nausea, and vomiting), hospital admissions, adequacy of dialysis, number of patients with amyloid related complications, ?2-microglobulin removal, and quality of life (QOL). Results:?No significant difference was found with regards to mortality, hospitalization, dialysis-related hypotension, dialysis-related symptoms, Kt/V, predialysis ?2-microglobulin values between convective modalities (HF/HDF/AFB) and HD, and HDF and AFB. Quality of life was assessed only in two studies comparing HF/HDF/AFB and HD. One study that used an unvalidated scoring tool showed that patients on convective modalities scored significantly better than those on HD; whereas, another study using a validated scoring system, the Kidney Diseases Questionnaire, failed to show significant differences between the two groups. Conclusions:?While this review summarized the best available evidence, it is based on very few trials. The trials included in this review are small and are therefore inadequately powered to detect differences between effects of the relevant treatments. Overall, HF, HDF, and AFB have not been shown to have significant advantage over HD with regard to clinically important outcomes of mortality, dialysis-related hypotension and manifestations of dialysis-related amyloidosis, and therefore, it is not possible to recommend the use of one modality in preference to the other.

AB  - Purpose:? Identify practices to reduce HD catheter access related bacteremias (ARB). Methods:?Data was collected per the CDC Dialysis Surveillance Network protocol. ARB was defined as a patient with a positive blood culture with no apparent source other than the vascular access catheter. ARB's were calculated in events per 100 patient months with 3 cohorts. Cohort 1 was observed for 12 months, Cohort 2 for the subsequent 10 months, and Cohort 3 for the final 10 months. Cohort 1 had weekly transparent dressing changes, cleansing of the skin and 5 minute soaking of the connection lines with 10% povidone-iodine (PI) solution, and HCW use of clean gloves and face shield without a mask. Cohort 2 changes consisted of thrice weekly gauze dressing changes, skin cleansing with ChloraPrep, a 2% CHG/70% isopropyl alcohol applicator, masks on the patients, adding a face mask to the shield, and application of 10% PI ointment to the exit site. Cohort 3 changes included weekly application of BioPatch (BioP), an antimicrobial dressing with CHG, sterile glove use, and replacing the PI line soaks with 4% CHG. Results:?The catheter-associated ARB rate per 100 patient months was 7.9 (17ARB/216 patient months) in Cohort 1, 8.6 (13/151) in Cohort 2, and 4.7 (5/107) in Cohort 3(p?=?0.31 compared with Cohorts 1 and 2 combined). During the last 2 months, in Cohort 3, 9 catheter lumen cracks occurred, with one of the patients having a bacteremia. Conclusions:?Addition of CHG line soaks and BioP reduced tunneled catheter infections, although this is not statistically significant. The increased number of catheter lumen cracks raises concern with the use of CHG line soaks. Further investigation with use of CHG line soaks and the BioP for decreasing ARB is needed.

AB  - While dialyzer manufacturers only provide information about their products as a black box, this study aimed at optimizing dialyzer geometry by looking in detail at transport processes and fluid properties inside the dialyzer using numerical modeling. A three-dimensional computer model of a single hollow fiber with its surrounding membrane and dialysate compartment was developed. Different equations govern blood and dialysate flow (Navier-Stokes), radial filtration flow (Darcy), and solute transport (convection-diffusion). Blood was modeled as a non- Newtonian fluid with a viscosity varying in radial and axial direction because of the influence of local hematocrit, diameter of the capillaries, and local shear rate. Dialysate flow was assumed as an incompressible, laminar Newtonian flow with a constant viscosity. The permeability characteristics of the asymmetrical polysulphone membrane were calculated from laboratory tests for forward and backfiltration. The influence of the oncotic pressure induced by the plasma proteins was implemented as well as the reduction of the overall permeability caused by the adhesion of a protein layer on the membrane. Urea (MW60) was used as a marker to simulate small molecule removal, while middle molecule transport was modeled using vitamin B12 (MW1355) and inulin (MW5200). The corresponding diffusion coefficients were determined by counting for the fluid and membrane characteristics. Fiber diameter and length were changed in a wide range for evaluation of solute removal efficiency. The presented model allowed us to investigate the impact of flow, hematocrit, and capillary dimensions on the presence and localization of backfiltration. Furthermore, mass transfer was found enhanced for increased fiber lengths and/or smaller diameters, most pronounced for the middle molecules compared to urea.

AB  - The Aksys PHD System, designed to utilize ultrapure dialyzate for quotidian hemodialysis at home, uses mechanical cleaning and hot water sanitization of the blood, dialysate, and water flow-paths from inlet to outlet. Since January 2000, it has been used by 110 US patients and 8 UK patients for a total of 106 patient years and more than 30,000 dialyses runs. Of those treated, 75 patients were male and 43 female; mean age was 52?±?25 (range 22?82) years; 65% were white, 25% black, and 10% other; mean weight was 78?±?20 (44?125)?kg; the cause of renal failure was primary renal disease (50%), hypertension (24%), diabetes (19%), and other (4%). Dialysis access included fistula (61%), graft (25%), and catheter (14%). Patients had been on ESRD therapy on average of 6?±?7 (0?32) years when starting on PHD dialysis. As of August 2004, patients had dialyzed 11?±?8 (1?52) months on the PHD. Of those, 78 patients remained on the PHD, 12 were transplanted, 10 died, 7 returned to conventional dialysis at the end of the original study for the FDA and 7 for medical or social reasons, 2 returned to quotidian dialysis on other equipment, and 2 stopped during home dialysis training. Patients dialyzed an average of 145?±?27?min, 5.6?±?0.6 dialyses/week with a QB of 376?±?45?ml/min and a QD of 545?±?170?ml/min. eKt/V was 0.68?±?0.20 and weekly stdKt/V was 2.61?±?0.52. Mean dialyser reuse was 17?±?14 times without significant decline in urea clearance. 23/118 patients (19%) who came to the PHD from quotidian dialysis on other equipment thought the PHD twice as easy to use and experienced only half as many episodes hypotension, cramps, headache, backache, nausea, and arrhythmias (all p?<?0.02). They were hospitalized only half as many days on the PHD. Cumulative patient survival was 60% at 4 years, with 94 deaths/1,000 patient years, relative risk 0.56 compared with age-matched patients from the USRDS database. Conclusion: This large clinical experience shows the PHD System is easier to use and delivers smoother dialysis with better cardiovascular stability than conventional dialysis machines. It easily fulfills the DOQI guidelines for adequacy of dialysis, economizes on use of dialyzers, tubing, and dialysate, results in less hospitalization, and appears to result in superior patient survival.

AB  - The biochemical, haemodynamic, clinical, and nutritional benefits of nocturnal haemodialysis (NHD) compared with (c/w) 4?hr, 3/week conventional haemodialysis (CHD) are well known and accrue by increasing dialysis time and frequency either for 8?hrs alternate night/week (NHD3.5) or for 8?hrs 6 nights/week NHD (NHD6). However, there is little data yet comparing NHD3.5 with NHD6. 13 NHD6(8.15?hrs/night) were c/w 14 NHD3.5(7.8?hrs/night), all with similar demographic profiles. NHD6 had unrestricted diet and fluid intake but NHD3.5 needed some restriction. Before (b) and after (a) HD phosphate (PO4) control was ideal though bPO4 levels for NHD6 were lower (1.64?mmol/l) c/w NHD3.5(1.83?mmol/l). All NHD6 needed PO4 supplementation c/w 2/14 NHD3.5 but 5/14 NHD3.5 needed PO4 binders c/w 0/13 NHD6. Both had normal blood pressures with 3/14 NHD3.5 needing anti-hypertensives c/w 2/13 NHD6. The bHb was 122.8?g/l (NHD6) c/w 127.7?g/l (NHD3.5) and the balbumin was 38.3?g/l (NHD6) c/w 37.7?g/l (NHD3.5). NHD6 had lower b blood urea (10.2 c/w 19.5?mmol/l) and less interdialytic urea and creatinine fluctuation. NHD6 ultrafiltration rates (UFR) and intradialytic weight gains (mean?±?SEM) were significantly lower (248?±?22.7?ml/hr and 2.03?±?0.19?kg) c/w NHD3.5(453?±?34.6?ml/hr and 2.85?±?0.27?kg): UFR p?<?0.10. We conclude that NHD6 offers the optimum biochemical, volume, and clinical outcome but NHD3.5 still has a clear and major advantage over CHD and a dual additional appeal to providers seeking home-based therapy cost advantages and consumable expenditure control. A flexible dialysis program should offer all the time and frequency options of NHD but, in particular, should support NHD at a frequency sympathetic to the clinical, rehabilitation, and lifestyle aspirations of individual patients.

AB  - Bacteremia is a common complication for hemodialysis (HD) patients (pts) with an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC). We studied our experience with CAB and noted that CAB occurred at an average of 96?±?98 days after CVC insertion. We wondered what percentage of CAB occurred in the first 21 days after CVC insertion and the spectrum of organisms. We prospectively collected data on all HD pts from 3 centers with a CVC who developed bacteremia between 1/1/03 and 8/31/04. Pts who developed CAB with an identifiable source of bacteremia were excluded. 131 episodes of CAB were identified; 34 (25.95%) occurred in ≤21 days. The mean?±?SDEV age of the pts developing CAB?>?21 days and ≤21 days was 63?±?17 and 61.5?±?15.4 years, respectively. Table 1 outlines the spectrum of organisms. There was a significantly greater incidence of CAB with Staphylococcus aureus(SA) and a significantly lower incidence of Staphylococcus epidermidis(SE) in the pts in whom a CAB developed ≤21 days after insertion. Table 1 <21 Days >21 Days P-Value SA 20 (58.8%) 21 (21.6%) p?<?0.01 SE ?2 (5.9%) 30 (30.9%) p?<?0.05 Other GP* ?7 (20.6%) 15 (15.5%) NS GN^ ?9 (26.5%) 40 (41.2%) NS *GP: gram-positive; GN?:?gram-negative We conclude that CAB occurs in the first 21 days after CVC insertion in 25% of our CVC pts. Pts developing CAB in the first 21 days are more likely to develop CAB with SA and less likely to develop CAB with SE than pts who develop CAB after 21 days. Empiric antibiotic choice and preventative strategies need to take these data into consideration.

AB  - Baclofen, a GABA agonist, is frequently used to treat muscle spasticity due to spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. Baclofen overdose can lead to coma, respiratory depression, hyporeflexia, and flaccidity. Because baclofen is primarily excreted unchanged through the kidneys, it should be given with caution, and it may be necessary to reduce the dosage.Signs of overdose may appear suddenly or insidiously. Acute massive overdose may present as coma. Less sudden and/or less severe forms of overdose may present with signs of CNS depression, excessive salivation, dizziness, nausea and/or vomiting, somnolence, and hypotonia. Should overdose appear likely, the patient should be taken immediately to a hospital. A 46-year-old man, who was treated by intermittent hemodialysis (three times a week), was admitted to our unit for signs of CNS depression, dizziness, vomiting, somnolence, and hypotonia. He was treated at the relatively low dose of baclofen, 5?mg/day, because of muscle spasticity due to spinal cord injury. His temperature was 37?°C, and predialysis laboratory data were hemoglobin 11.4?g/dl, white blood cells 6550/mm3 with normal differential count, and platelets 330000/mm3. Serum sodium was 134?mmol/l, potassium 6.4?mmom/l, bicarbonate 18.3?mmol/l, urea 30?mmol/l, creatinine 998??mol/l, glucose 5.16?mmol/l, and calcium level 2.4?mmol/l. Serum transaminases were normal. A brain computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no abnormalities. Baclofen-associated encephalopathy was considered to be the most likely etiology for this acute neurological picture. Baclofen was then stopped. Plasma concentration of baclofen was >600?ng/ml (therapeutic range 80?400?ng/ml) after 2 hours of hemodialysis and the baclofen level rapidly fell (<200?ng/ml) at the end of the hemodialysis session. After the first 4-h haemodialysis session, there was an incomplete recovery of the neurological status. After a renewed hemodialysis session the symptoms completely receded.The patient was discharged from the hospital 72?h later in a good condition. Patients with severely impaired renal function generally develop baclofen intoxication soon after the initiation of low-dose therapy. Thus, the administration of baclofen, regardless of the dosage, in these patients is not appropriate.

AB  - An increased frequency of the Milk-Alkali syndrome in the last several years has been noticed related to increasing use of calcium carbonate as a phosphate binder in CKD patients, as an antacid or as calcium supplementation. We present a case of severe hypercalcemia secondary to Milk-Alkali syndrome that precipitated acute renal failure requiring urgent hemodialysis. A 59-year-old male with history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and acid reflux presented to the ER with confusion, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. His family relayed a history of recent indigestion and relief with Tums. He was taking several tablets at short intervals to self-treat the indigestion. At the time of presentation, patient was confused and noted to be dehydrated. Lab findings were significant for elevated BUN/Cr- 121?mg/dl/11.1?mg/dl (baseline Cr 1.1?mg/dl few months ago), bicarbonate 38?mg/dl, calcium 16.7?mg/dl, ionized Ca of 1.76?mmol/L, iPTH 10?pg/ml, PTHrP 0.7?pg/ml. Medical management with intravenous fluids and furosemide showed no improvement in renal failure, or calcium level. Patient was then started on hemodialysis with 2.0?mmol/L calcium in the dialysate the next day. There was gradual improvement in patient's mental status, calcium values, and renal failure over the ensuing 2 weeks. Discussion and Conclusions:? The diagnosis of Milk-Alkali syndrome is made on the basis of history. Metabolic abnormalities involved in this syndrome are hypercalcemia with low to normal PTH and Vit. D levels, renal failure, and metabolic alkalosis. Failed medical management required acute dialysis in this patient. Acute hemodialysis in such a case could be life saving. Due to increasing use of calcium carbonate for dyspepsia and osteoporosis, patients should be made aware of these severe, potentially life-threatening adverse effects.

AB  - Forty-one consecutive admissions to a hemodialysis center were evaluated. Demographic information including age, gender, race, and diagnosis was collected. Patients, >18 years old, with end stage renal disease and on hemodialysis for at least one year were included. Those with edema or known ascites were excluded. Weight was measured before and after hemodialysis (HD) using a standard scale and by considering the amount of fluid loss by the hemodialysis machine. Body composition including total body water (TBW) was calculated before and after HD using near infrared interactance (NIR). All measurements were completed during half hour before and after HD. Forty-one patients included: men (n?=?26), women (n?=?15); median age 58 (range 28?88 years). Twenty-eight were African American and the rest Caucasians. The amount of intravascular fluid taken after HD (assessed by weight reduction) ranged 0?5?L with median 2.2?L. NIR analysis for the same patients at the same time showed different total body water measurements in 91% of cases (P?>?0.05). Moreover, NIR analysis showed increase in total body water in 24% of patients even though the hemodialysis machine showed a loss of total body water; median of 1.3 (range: 0?3L). The error in measuring body composition with NIR was both large and varied (random and not systematic error). We conclude that NIR analysis cannot be considered as a reliable method to evaluate body composition, especially total body water, amongst patients with end stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis.

AB  - Objective: To describe the use of argatroban in a post-cardiac operation patient with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia requiring hemodialysis and continuous veno-veno hemodialysis (CVVH). Case Summary:A 23-year-old Caucasian female with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia developed acute renal failure after cardiovascular surgery. Argatroban was used as a substitute for heparin during hemodialysis and CVVH. Both activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and activated clotting time (ACT) were used to guide the dosage of argatroban. The patient was successfully dialyzed without clotting of the circuit. The dosage required in our patient was much lower than the manufacturer's recommendation. Discussion:Argatroban is a thrombin inhibitor that does not cross react with heparin. It is metabolized by the liver, and dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The correct dosage for patient with unstable hemodynamics is not known. Our patient had apparently normal hepatic function at the initiation of dialysis, but the dosage of argatroban recommended by the manufacturer resulted in prolonged elevation of the aPTT and ACT with associated gastrointestinal bleeding. This may be related to hepatic congestion secondary to poor cardiac function and/or severe anasarca. And the dosage of argatroban required during dialysis was much lower than the recommendation. Conclusions:Argatroban is an effective alternative of heparin for CVVH. The correct initial dosage in patients with mild hepatic impairment and unstable hemodynamics is still unclear.
