AB  - Objective:? This observational study was undertaken to evaluate the frequency of acute complications occurring during dialysis sessions and their association with other clinical and biochemical parameters. Method:?Forty-six maintenance hemodialysis patients were selected and evaluated. Mean of the weekly evaluations of different parameters over a three-month period is presented here. Result:?Age of study subjects was 39?±?13 years and body mass index (BMI) 21?±?4?kg/m2. Duration of hemodialysis was 41?±?29 months. Most of the patients were hypertensive (98%), taking multiple anti-hypertensive drugs. Mean of the blood pressures before and at the end of dialysis sessions over the three month period were: systolic blood pressure (SBP) 159?±?18 vs. 163?±?22 (p?<?0.05) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 92?±?13 vs. 87?±?7?mmHg (p?<?0.003). Frequency of acute complicating symptoms during dialysis sessions were: headache (75%), rise in blood pressure (73%), leg cramps (67%), vomiting (60%), palpitation (58%), sweating (52%), and hypotension (35%). Raised blood pressure showed a positive correlation with headache (r?=?0.50, p?<?0.01) and sweating (r?=?0.53, p?<?0.05). Vomiting and palpitation were more frequent at low post-dialysis blood pressure (vomiting vs. post-SBP-r?=??0.41, p?<?0.05 and palpitation vs. post-DBP-r?=??0.48, p?<?0.05), and these patients were likely to get inadequate dialysis (hypotension vs. Kt/V-r?=??0.63, p?<?0.01). Pre and post dialysis weight variation was 53?±?11 vs. 51?±?11?kg (p?<?0.001), average ultrafiltration during dialysis (UF)?2.39 (0.5?4) liter and single session Kt/V was 0.95?±?0.38. The rising tendency of post-dialysis blood pressure correlated positively with increasing UF (SBP vs. UF-r?=?0.36, p?<?0.01 and DBP vs. UF-r?=?0.25, p?<?0.05). Conclusion:?From this study it may be concluded that acute complications during dialysis sessions have a significant correlation with deranged blood pressure regulation, and optimum control of blood pressure could provide better dialysis.

AB  - Purpose: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred blood access for hemodialysis due to its longevity and resistance to infection. Little attention is given to the long-term hemodynamic consequences of large left-to-right shunts, particularly in patients with brachial artery fistulae. Materials and Methods:?We describe 9 patients (8 on dialysis, 1 post-transplant), aged 25?73, who developed clinical heart failure, primarily due to large, upper arm AVFs. Results:?4/9 had access flows in excess of 2 liters/min, assessed by blood temperature monitoring. 6/9 had cardiac output measured by right heart catheterization, before and after shunt compression. One also underwent left heart catheterization with ventriculography. 3/9 had surgical reduction of the fistula, either by banding or by serial interposition of small caliber GoreTex graft. In 2/9 the shunt was ligated. One patient had heart failure in association with 2 large, upper arm AVFs, one of which was ligated. After years of improved cardiac symptoms, heart failure recurred in association with marked hypertrophy of his remaining AVF. Resting cardiac output in this patient was in excess of 11 liters/min. 2/9 experienced acute onset of heart failure within 1?3 days of angioplasty of a venous stenosis. One of these, with very poor baseline cardiac function, expired. Surgical revision or ligation was accompanied by clinical improvement in the 5 patients so treated. One of these expired of a stroke after two months of cardiac improvement. Conclusion:?High output heart failure is under-diagnosed in dialysis patients. Patients with large upper arm shunts are particularly at risk. Access flow should be assessed regularly and those with outputs >1.5 liters/min should be monitored closely for development of heart failure. Surgical correction is beneficial and indicated in symptomatic patients.

AB  - Objective To evaluate C-reactive protein at presentation and during hospitalisation in dogs with acute kidney injury resulting from leptospirosis to compare C-reactive protein at presentation in dogs with acute kidney injury of different aetiology and to study its correlation with markers of inflammation, azotaemia and survival. Materials and Methods Prospective observational study of 41 dogs with acute kidney injury secondary to leptospirosis and 15 control dogs with acute kidney injury of different aetiology. C-reactive protein was measured at presentation in both groups and daily for 7 days in a subgroup of 28 dogs with leptospirosis. The associations of C-reactive protein with neutrophil count, albumin, urea, creatinine and survival were analysed. Results C-reactive protein was increased at presentation in all dogs with leptospirosis but was not significantly different from dogs with acute kidney injury of different cause. It was associated with markers of inflammation (neutrophil count, albumin) but not with azotaemia (creatinine, urea). It decreased gradually from presentation to day 4, with significantly lower concentrations in survivors than non-survivors. Initial C-reactive protein was only weakly associated with outcome, but its average concentration from presentation to day 2 was more strongly associated. Absolute and relative changes in C-reactive protein during hospitalisation and creatinine at presentation were not associated with survival. Clinical Significance Serial assessment of C-reactive protein may improve outcome prediction in dogs with leptospirosis compared with a single measurement at presentation or with markers of renal function.

AB  - Abstract Background: Perioperative enteral immunonutrition is thought to reduce postoperative morbidity in patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery. This study assessed the clinical effects of preoperative enteral immunonutrition in well nourished patients with gastric cancer undergoing total gastrectomy. Methods: Well nourished patients with primary gastric cancer, fit for total gastrectomy, were randomized to either a control group with regular diet, or an immunonutrition group that received regular diet supplemented with 1000 ml/day of immunonutrients for 5 consecutive days before surgery. The primary endpoint was the incidence of surgical-site infection (SSI). Secondary endpoints were rates of infectious complications, overall postoperative morbidity and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels on 3?4 days after surgery. Results: Of 244 randomized patients, 117 were allocated to the control group and 127 received immunonutrition. SSIs occurred in 27 patients in the immunonutrition group and 23 patients in the control group (risk ratio (RR) 1·09, 95 per cent confidence interval 0·66 to 1·78). Infectious complications were observed in 30 patients in the immunonutrition group and 27 in the control group (RR 1·11, 0·59 to 2·08). The overall postoperative morbidity rate was 30·8 and 26·1 per cent respectively (RR 1·18, 0·78 to 1·78). The median CRP value was 11·8 mg/dl in the immunonutrition group and 9·2 mg/dl in the control group (P = 0·113). Conclusion: Five-day preoperative enteral immunonutrition failed to demonstrate any clear advantage in terms of early clinical outcomes or modification of the systemic acute-phase response in well nourished patients with gastric cancer undergoing elective total gastrectomy.

AB  - Objective:? The aim of this study is to determine the factors contributing to survival of patients on hemodialysis. Methods: Data were collected from 8 dialysis centers, and 432 patients were recruited. Among them, patients who underwent hemodialysis thrice a week for more than 3 years and received antihypertensive therapy or had systolic blood pressure of more than 160?mm Hg before dialysis secession were selected. Subsequent survival status and cause of death were ascertained for the next 3.5 years. The logistic multivariate regression analysis was used to estimate the relative risk of death. Variables used for the purpose of this analysis were patient gender, age, underlying renal disease (unknown and others (0), CGN (1), DM (2)), medication, serum albumin, history of having cerebrovascular and/or cardiovascular accidents (yes or no), the levels of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, pre- and post-dialysis blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), hemoglobin, serum calcium and inorganic phosphate, ?2-microglobulin, intact PTH, and other laboratory data. Results:?First step logistic regression analysis indicated age, underlying renal diseases, serum creatinine, GOT, ?2-microglobulin were associated with increased relative risk (RR) of dying. According to the formula calculated in this analysis, if the levels of serum creatinine increased 1?mg/dl, the ratio of dying increased by 1.210. Also, compared to the patients aged between 50 to 64 years old, the patients aged between 65 to 90 years old had 1.521 times dying ratio. Conclusions:?From this study, it is suggested that age, creatinine, underlying renal diseases, ?2-microblobulin, past history of cerebrovascular disease, serum creatinine, and GOT were important factors contributing to patients? survival.

AB  - Introduction:? The aim of renal replacement therapy (RRT) is to achieve a reduction in morbid events and improve quality of life (QOL). Mortality means the condition of being subject to death. Morbidity is anything that is abnormal, atypical, exceptional, and/or aberrant. Morbidity usually occurs as a result of a treatment (side effects), when treatment is inappropriate or inadequate. Predictors that may be risk factors for mortality and morbidity in dialysis patients can be divided into patient-related and treatment-related categories (Khan, 2000:11). Purpose of the study:?The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the morbidity and mortality profile of patients receiving RRT in the private sector. Research design and method:?This study was contextual and descriptive in nature, based on case analysis of patients receiving RRT in private dialysis facilities. A checklist was used that made provisions to record all patient- and treatment- related factors that might influence mortality and morbidity profiles of the target population. The target population included all hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients receiving treatment in private dialysis facilities of a specific company. Results:?The results indicated the following factors have an influence on patient morbidity and mortality: ?? Patient related: Age, comorbid situations such as peripheral vascular, cerebrovascular, and cardiovascular disease and also diabetes mellitus. ?? Treatment related: Referral pattern, nutritional status, dialysis adequacy, anaemia, and blood pressure.

AB  - Hemodialysis is a common treatment of chronic renal failure, also in childhood. Due to the high standard of technique there are only few contraindications for this treatment at present. Limitations are given by the vessel access. But in the last years, hemodialysis has been made practicable by the permanent central venous catheter, however, with more problems. As an example for potential complications in the treatment with the permanent catheter we present an unusual case report about a twenty-one- year-old girl suffering from chronic renal failure due to reflux nephropathy, Prader-Willi- syndrome, myelonatrophia of undetermined origin with spastic diplegia of the legs, and increasing sphincter ani dysfunction. We started the renal replacement therapy when the girl was 15 years old. It was not possible to create an AV fistula due to very small vessels. Two Gore-Tex ? implants were clotted in absence of thrombophilia. Afterwards, the hemodialysis was performed by a permanent central venous catheter. The catheter had to be changed 15 times. The reasons for changing the catheter were problems of flow during hemodialysis due to clotting, dislocations, spontaneous removing of the catheter by herself, and infections. Altogether a sepsis occurred four times. The first transplantation failed due to a rupture of the transplanted kidney. A second transplantation was not possible because of the high BMI. Intermittently, the girl was treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) in the hospital, because the PD couldn?t be done at home due to different reasons. Only on weekends could the girl go home. The PD had to be finished after 6 months due to a severe psychotic syndrome. The girl died at age 21, caused by a sepsis following the 15th change of the catheter. A huge problem of frequent catheter changing is the limited availability of vessel accesses ? the limits of treatment by hemodialysis.

AB  - Introduction:? Methanol poisoning can lead to complications that include metabolic acidosis, visual impairment and death. Treatment options include ethanol, fomepizole, and hemodialysis (HD). Objective:?To report on the occurrence of post dialysis methanol rebound during treatment. Method and Findings:?A 40-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia and suicide attempts presented to the emergency room after reportedly ingesting 1 quart of windshield washer fluid. The patient presented with a preliminary blood chemistry of methanol 390?mg/dL, ethanol 48?mg/dL, glucose 93?mg/dL, Na 138?meq/L, K 3.8?meq/L, Cl 98?mmol/L, CO2 26?mmol/L, urea 16?mg/dL, creatinine 1.2?mg/dL, and an anion gap of 14?mmol/L. The patient was started on 1360?mg of fomepizole (12:50 AM) followed by HD for 4 hours. A second dose of fomepizole (900?mg) was administered at 8:00 AM. In addition, another HD session was started at 12:00 PM and continued for 4 hours. A third dose of fomepizole (700?mg) was administered at 8:50 PM. Finally, a third HD session was started the next day at 3:05 PM and lasted 3 hours. Table 1 illustrates methanol levels in relation to each HD session. Findings:?Methanol concentration after the first HD increased from 100?mg/dL to 127?mg/dL (27%) in 5?h 20?m. It also increased from 35?mg/dL to 50?mg/dL (43%) 14?h 45?m after the second HD. Conclusions:?Close attention must be paid to the potential for post dialysis methanol rebound. It is recommended that methanol levels continue to be monitored for several hours after HD. 1 Methanol levels before and after each hemodialysis Start HD #1 ?(2:40 AM) End HD #1 ?(6:40 AM) Start HD#2 ?(12:00 PM) End HD#2 ?(4:00 PM) Next Day ?(6:45 AM) Methanol (mg/dL) 324 100 127 35 50 Rebound 27% 43%

AB  - Control of certain clinical and laboratory parameters affects morbidity and mortality of type 2 diabetic patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) both before and after initiation of hemodialysis (HD). To identify areas and stage of renal failure where control of these critical variables needs improvement, we compared important clinical and laboratory parameters 6 months before (PRE) and 6 months after starting HD (POST) in 43 type 2 diabetic men with CRF, who were 69.3?±?10.7 years old at HD initiation. Differences, all at p?≤?0.05, were found in blood pressure, in mm Hg, at the physician's office, both systolic (PRE 154?±?16, POST 138?±?18) and diastolic (PRE 77?±?13, POST 69?±?11), serum cholesterol in mg/dL (PRE 206?±?61, POST 159?±?40), and serum creatinine in mg/dL (PRE 4.1?±?1.3, POST 7.0?±?1.8), while no differences were noted in blood hematocrit (PRE 36?±?7%, POST 34?±?9%), blood glycosylated hemoglobin (PRE 7.4?±?1.7%, POST 6.9?±?2.3%), serum glucose in mg/dL (PRE 151?±?67, POST 184?±?94), serum phosphorus in mg/dL (PRE 4.5?±?0.8, POST 4.6?±?1.5), serum calcium in mg/dL (PRE 8.7?±?0.5, POST 8.5?±?1.4), and serum albumin in g/dL (PRE 3.2?±?0.5, POST 3.4?±?0.6). Compared to the POST category, significantly (p?≤?0.05) higher percentages were found in the PRE category for systolic blood pressure >150?mm Hg (PRE 58.8%, POST 26.5%), blood glycosylated hemoglobin >8%(PRE 33.3%, POST 13.3%), serum cholesterol >200?mg/dL (PRE 48.4%, POST 19.4%). A lower percentage was found in the PRE category for serum phosphorus >5.5?mg/dL (PRE 13.2%, POST 31.6%), while the corresponding percentages for serum albumin <3.0?g/dL (PRE 21.6%, POST 18.9%) and serum calcium <8?mg/dL (PRE 7.9%, POST 13.2%) did not differ. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and renal failure, control of blood pressure, glycemia, and serum lipids appears to be better; whereas, control of serum phosphorus is worse in the first year after starting chronic hemodialysis than in the preceding year. There is room for improvement, both before and after hemodialysis initiation, in the control of these variables, which affect the clinical outcomes of hemodialysis.

AB  - Objective: Feasibility and safety evaluation of citrate anticoagulation for hemodiafiltration (CVVHD) procedure in a pediatric critical care unit. Patients and Methods:From 08?2002 to 12?2003, five patients were treated by CVVHD with regional citrate anticoagulation, age range 1.4?16?yrs, body weight 6.7?38?kg. Inclusion criteria: oligoanuria and hypervolemia and/or uremia, hemodynamic instability, and impossibility of peritoneal dialysis. The patient's primary diseases were: liver disease (4/5) and chronic renal disease (1/5). All patients were on mechanical ventilation and on vasopressor support and presented with thrombocytopenia. Hepatic dysfunction was observed in four patients. The CVVHD prescription was: blood flow rate: 2?5?ml/min, dialysate and replacement flow rate: 3000?ml/1.73?m2/h. Citrate regional anticoagulation (4% trisodium citrate) was used according to a previously described protocol (Bunchman et al., Pediatr Nephrol 2002: 17:150?154). The duration of each individual procedure was 9?72 hours, and the total time range of CVVHD was 2 to 19 days. A bicarbonate based solution (Na 140?mEq/L and bicarbonate 35?mEq/L) was prepared in our hospital pharmacy. Prisma system (GAMBRO) and polycrylonitrile M-60 Pre-set hemofilter was used in 4/5 patients and M-10 Pre-set hemofilter in one patient. Results:The use of M-10 filter was associated with a higher rates of ACD-A and calcium infusion (ml/h). Metabolic alkalosis was observed in one patient and hypernatremia in three patients. All patients died of causes other than renal failure (sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome). No bleeding related to citrate occurred. Conclusion: Citrate anticoagulation proved to be feasible with minor side effects in pediatric ICU patients. The high mortality can be related to the severity of multiple organ failure.

In this study we aimed to define frequencies of BsmI and TagI Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms and possible influences on clinical presentations in Turkish ESRD population. Methodology and Patients:?186 patients (111 male, 75 female) who are being maintained on hemodialysis were included. Genotyping was performed for the insertion/deletion BsmI (B?b, restriction site, exon VIII?IX), TagI (T?t, 352 exon IX) VDR gene polymorphisms. Last 12 months? laboratory values (C-reactive protein, intact parathyroid hormone, albumin, calcium, phosphorus, Ca x P product) and clinical findings (vitamin D requirement, body weight) were recorded and analysed retrospectively. Results:?Mean age and follow-up period lengths were 42.1?±?12.6 years and 76.3?±?43.9 months, respectively. Polymorphism percentages were as follows: BsmI; BB/Bb/bb: 28.9/65.3/5.8%, TagI; TT/Tt/tt: 36.7/60.5/2.8%, respectively. Further analysis revealed that TT variant of TagI was related with hyperparathyroidism (p?<?0.05). Analysis of data after regrouping patients according to iPTH levels (0?249, 250?499, 500?+?pg/mL) and hemodialysis duration (<60 vs ≥60 months) revealed that influence of TT variation on hyperparathyroidism became more frequent in case of increased hemodialysis duration and iPTH levels (p?<?0.005). Conclusion:?TT variation of TagI VDR gene influences the development of hyperparathyroidism in HD patients. This influence becomes more evident in patients with longer HD duration.

AB  - To overcome problems of insufficient clearance, multiple dialyzers may be placed in series or in parallel. The present study aimed to investigate in vitro the overall clearance of small molecules in different dialyzer configurations in which mutual flow directions were changed. Single pass tests were performed with low flux Fresenius F6HPS dialyzers placed in series (12 tests), in parallel (6) and in single use (2). As blood substitute, either high concentrated (45?mS) bicarbonate dialysate (AB solution ? MW20-180) or a trisodiumphosphate (Na3PO4? MW395) concentration (30?mS) was used. Standard blood and dialysate flows of 250 and 500?mL/min, respectively, were applied. Furthermore, clearance was derived from conductivity measurements in the inlet and outlet bloodline, correcting for the overall ultrafiltration rate of 0.5?L/h (AB) and 0.1?L/h (Na3PO4). Compared to the standard setup using a single dialyzer with counter current flows, clearance increases by 3 to 8%(AB) and by 15 to 18%(Na3PO4) using two dialyzers in parallel and in series, respectively. With co-current flows in a serial dialyzer set up, clearance increases by 16%(AB) and 22%(Na3PO4) compared to the single dialyzer use. Changing subsequently the counter current flows to co-current in one and both dialyzers in series, the overall clearance decreases by 2 to 9%, respectively, for the AB solution, and by 8 to 15% for the Na3PO4 concentration. With respect to the parallel dialyzer setup, a split dialysate flow (250?mL/min in each dialyzer) counter current to the blood flow, increases the clearance by 4 and 12%, respectively. In conclusion, overall clearance is most ameliorated using two dialyzers in series with counter current flows.

AB  - The incidence of active tuberculosis among patients on long- term dialysis is higher than the rate in the general population. Case:?39-year-old male patient with ESRD was admitted to hospital with dyspnea, weight loss, cough without sputum and hemoptysis, and a palpable painless mass under the right areola. He was on maintenance hemodialysis three times a week for the last six months. PPD was negative. Chest X-ray examination revealed a hyperdense lesion. On the computerized tomography a cystic mass at the inferior lobe superior segment near the thorasic vertebra was detected. Fine needle aspiration from each of the mass lesions revealed granulomas and acido-resistant bacteria. Anti-tuberculous therapy was initiated. After eight months he came back with paraplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the lesion which previously has been described by CT was extending to the spinal duct and pressing on the spinal cord. After a biopsy, granuloma was seen; however, mycobacterium tuberculosis did not grow in the culture. Discussion:?Extrapulmonary tuberculosis is common in patients with ESRD. In the present case we established that the patient who presented a mass on the chest wall without pulmonary tuberculosis findings had indeed a tuberculous cavity mass. It is interesting to note that in this case this mass had no relationship to the tuberculous cavity in the lung tissue. Moreover, it is also interesting that paraspinal lesion occured during the period in which the patient was under treatment and it quickly progressed and led to paraplegia. Tissue biopsy with invasive procedures may be necessary. Thus, in areas with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, renal patients in high-risk group (renal transplant recipients, hemodialysis and CAPD patients) should be examined periodically to exclude silent infection and reduce morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Poor patient compliance is common during dialysis therapy. We aimed to study incidence of noncompliance, contributing factors, and effects on quality of life (QOL) among cadaveric renal transplantation waiting list patients. We included 86 renal transplantation waiting list patients (56M/30F). Dialysis duration, previous renal transplantation history, comorbid conditions, interdialytic weight gain, predialysis BUN, creatinine, potassium, and phosphate were recorded. Noncompliance criteria were skipping >1 dialysis session or shortening a dialysis session>10?min in 1 month, interdialytic weight gain>5.7% of body weight, predialysis serum potassium >6?mEq/L, and phosphate level >7.5?mg/dl. There were 49 noncompliant (age: 46.8?±?21.8 years, HD duration: 83.9?±?48.7 months) and 37 compliant (age: 42.8?±?12.1 years, HD duration: 96.5?±?45.2 months) patients. QOL was evaluated by short form 36 and depression levels by Beck Depression Inventory. Previous renal transplantation was present in 24.4% and comorbid diseases in 31.3% of all patients. In depressed patients, 77.8% had comorbid diseases. No difference was found between the groups considering age, gender, dialysis duration, previous transplantation history, and comorbid diseases (p?>?0.05). Noncompliant patients had lower QOL (p?<?0.04). Noncompliant patients had higher degree of depression (p?=?0.01). QOL and Beck scores were negatively correlated (p?=?0.001, r?=??0.561). Noncompliance to diet and dialysis therapy is associated with depression, which further decreases QOL in renal transplantation waiting list patients. Early diagnosis of depression, is possible by monitoring noncompliance, and therapeutic intervention may benefit during the transplantation-waiting period.

AB  - Does early intervention with a light mobilization program reduce long-term sick leave for low back pain? (Central Hospital in Hedmark, Ottestad, Norway) Spine 2000;25:1973?1976. This randomized, controlled clinical trial investigated the effect of a light mobilization program on the duration of sick leave for patients with subacute low back pain. Early intervention with information, diagnostics, and light mobilization may be a cost-effective method for returning patients quickly to normal activity. In this experiment, patients were referred to a low back pain clinic and given a simple and systematic program as an outpatient treatment. Patients sick-listed 8 to 12 weeks (N = 457) for low back pain were randomized into two groups: an intervention group (n = 237) and a control group (n = 220). The intervention group was examined at a spine clinic and given information and advice to stay active. The control group was not examined at the clinic, but was treated with conventional primary health care. At 12-month follow-up assessment, 68.4% in the intervention group had returned to full-duty work, as compared with 56.4% in the control group. Conclude that early intervention with examination, information, and recommendations to stay active showed significant effects in reducing sick leave for patients with low back pain. Comment by Susan Anderson, MD. This is a randomized controlled clinical trial to compare patients that have been sick listed for more than 8 weeks in Norway. Comparison was between a control group that received conventional primary health care and an intervention group that was examined at a spine clinic, given information, and advised to stay active. The authors wanted to examine if an early intervention with information, diagnostics, and light mobilization may be a cost-effective method for returning patients quickly to normal activity. This study involved 457 patients that were sick listed 8 to 12 weeks for low back pain. The inclusion criteria for the study was based on 1) 8 to 12 weeks being ?sick-listed,? 2) age (18 to 60 years), and 3) diagnosis that included back pain, low back pain, leg and thigh pain, back pain without sciatica, and sciatica. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, recent low back trauma, cauda equina symptoms, cancer, osteoporosis, rheumatic low back disease, and ongoing low back treatment. The intervention used was modification of Indahl's light mobilization program where the patient was referred to a spine clinic, answered standard questionnaires, and was interviewed and examined by a treatment team consisting of a physician and a physiotherapist. Any somatic findings during the examination were explained to the patient and information was given about their importance. All radiographs were shown and explained. The idea was to educate the patient and dedramatize their problems. The patient was assured of a good prognosis and informed of the importance of remaining active to avoid development of muscle dysfunction. The physiotherapist individually advises the patient on how to train and stretch at home. They were also advised on how to manage the back pain and resume normal activity. The patients in the control group were not examined at the clinic, but were treated with primary health care, which included at least one visit to a general practitioner. The patients were reassessed at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. The assessment was to determine if the patient had returned to full duty work. At each of the assessments, the intervention group had a higher percentage of patients that had returned to full duty work. At the 12-month follow-up, 68.4% in the intervention group had returned to full duty work as compared with 56.4% in a controlled group. This study demonstrates that a consultation with thorough examination, information, reassurance, and encouragement shows a significant effect in reducing sick leave for patients with low back pain as compared to the conventional health care guidelines used by general practitioners that tend to recommend bed rest, caution, and reduced activities. The authors suggest that information and fear reduction when offered systematically may reduce the fear of ?doing something wrong? to the back. This may then prevent unnecessary activity and long sick leave.

AB  - Summary Innate immunity is fundamental to our defense against microorganisms. Physiologically, the intravascular innate immune system acts as a purging system that identifies and removes foreign substances leading to thromboinflammatory responses, tissue remodeling, and repair. It is also a key contributor to the adverse effects observed in many diseases and therapies involving biomaterials and therapeutic cells/organs. The intravascular innate immune system consists of the cascade systems of the blood (the complement, contact, coagulation, and fibrinolytic systems), the blood cells (polymorphonuclear cells, monocytes, platelets), and the endothelial cell lining of the vessels. Activation of the intravascular innate immune system in vivo leads to thromboinflammation that can be activated by several of the system's pathways and that initiates repair after tissue damage and leads to adverse reactions in several disorders and treatment modalities. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge in the field and discuss the obstacles that exist in order to study the cross-talk between the components of the intravascular innate immune system. These include the use of purified in vitro systems, animal models and various types of anticoagulants. In order to avoid some of these obstacles we have developed specialized human whole blood models that allow investigation of the cross-talk between the various cascade systems and the blood cells. We in particular stress that platelets are involved in these interactions and that the lectin pathway of the complement system is an emerging part of innate immunity that interacts with the contact/coagulation system. Understanding the resulting thromboinflammation will allow development of new therapeutic modalities.
