AB  - In end-stage renal failure, impaired renal catabolism leads to retention of beta 2 microglobulin (ß2M), identified as the major constituent of hemodialysis (HD) related amyloidosis. It has been previously shown that, while using a high flux (HF) HD membrane, nocturnal hemodialysis (NHD) with its increased time and frequency provides a much higher clearance of ß2M compared to conventional HD. We compared serum ß2M levels between low flux (LF) and HF in a group of 9 NHD patients who dialyse 8 hours 6 nights/week. Fresenius polysulfone LF membrane size F6-F8 HPS dialyser were used for the first 15 months (mth) of NHD (SA 1.3?1.8?m2). Subsequently, polysulfone HF FX80 dialyzer were used (SA 1.8?m2). Blood flow and dialysate flow rates were unchanged throughout the study. ß2M levels were measured at 6, 12, 15?mth on LF and at 6, 12?mth on HF. Albumin, homocysteine (Hcy), and phosphate (Phos) levels were also recorded at these times. ß2M levels trended upwards during the 15?mth on LF (36.6?±?10.57 at 6?mth vs 47.1?±?11.7 at 15?mth). On introduction of HF, there was a significant fall in ß2M at 6?mth to 12.4?±?3.5 (p?<?0.003), while ß2M levels were unchanged at 12?mth of HF. A downward trend in Hcy levels with the use of HF was noted (12.9?±?2.9 at 0?mth Vs 11.1?±?3.7 at 12?mth). Plasma albumin and Phos levels remained unchanged as did the use of Phos supplementation. Levels of ß2M continued to rise on NHD with LF, indicating inadequate clearance. With the introduction of HF there was a significant fall in ß2M levels consistent with improved clearance. The implications of this are that ß2M clearance may be time and frequency dependent only if dialyser membrane flux is adequate.

AB  - Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is widely used in critically ill patients with acute renal failure (ARF). The survival of patients who require CRRT and the factors predicting their outcomes are not well defined. We sought to identify clinical features to predict survival in patients treated with CRRT. We reviewed the charts of all patients who received CRRT at the Toronto General Hospital during the year 2002. Our cohort (n?=?85) represented 97% of patients treated with this modality in 3 critical care units. We identified demographic variables, underlying diagnoses, transplantation status, location (medical-surgical, coronary or cardiovascular surgery intensive care units), CRRT duration, baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl), and presence of oliguria (<400?ml/d) on the day of CRRT initiation. The principal outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Among those alive at discharge, we assessed whether there was an ongoing need for renal replacement therapy. Greater than one-third (38%, 32/85) of patients survived to hospital discharge. Three (9%) of the survivors remained dialysis-dependent at the time of discharge. Survivors were younger than non-survivors (mean age 56 vs 60?y.), were on CRRT for a shorter duration (7 vs 13?d.), and had a higher baseline CrCl (79 vs 68?ml/min). Patient survival varied among different critical care units (medical surgical 33%, coronary 38%, and cardiovascular surgery 45%). Multivariable logistic regression revealed that shorter duration of CRRT, non-oliguria, and baseline CrCl?>?60?ml/min were independently associated with survival to hospital discharge (p?<?0.05). Critically ill patients with ARF who require CRRT continue to have high in-hospital mortality. A shorter period of CRRT dependence, non-oliguria, and higher baseline renal function may predict a more favorable prognosis. The majority of CRRT patients who survive their critical illness are independent from dialysis at the time of hospital discharge.

AB  - Objective:? The aim of this study was to observe the anticoagulant effect of the new type of citrate anticoagulant hemodialysate in renal failure patients at high risk of bleeding. Methods:?57 patients at high risk of bleeding were given hemodialysis for 4 hours and were divided into 3 groups according to hemodialysis procedures: Group 1 was saline-flush hemodialysed with bicarbonate hemodialysate. Group 2 was hemodialysed with citrate hemodialysate and with no anticoagulant. Group 3 was hemodialysed with bicarbonate hemodialysate and with nadroparin calcium (a low molecular weight heparin, LMWH) as anticoagulant. Bleeding complication, coagulation of extracorporeal circuit, venous blood pressure, heart rate, QTC, activated coagulation time (ACT), ionized-calcium (iCa++), total calcium and pH, , Na+, K+, Cl?, BUN, Cr, GPT, GST, TBIL, DBIL, as well as the blood cell counts were monitored during hemodialysis, and a scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis was used to investigate the morphology of thrombus formation and cellular aggregation on the interior surface of hemodialysis membranes. Results:?During the hemodialysis in Group 1, venous blood pressure increased continuously, resulting in the failure of hemodialysis for 4 out of 19 patients. Hemodialysis for 4 hours in Group 2 were all successfully fulfilled. No bleeding episodes occurred. No severe clotting of dialyzers and blood accesses was observed. ACT was extended and iCa++ decreased obviously in the venous line, but ACT and iCa++ in vivo were normal. pH, tended to increase but not to metabolic alkalosis levels. Na+, K+, Cl?, GPT, GST, TBIL, DBIL, as well as the counts of blood cells were all within the normal range. There was no severe thrombus observed by SEM in the hollow fibers. In Group 3, severe bleeding complication happened to 3 out of 19 patients, and one of them died. ACT was extended obviously at the arterial end. Conclusions:?The citrate anticoagulant hemodialysate was proved to be practical, safe and effective. So it is indicated for patients with an active or recently active bleeding focus.

AB  - The most common complication of tunneled-cuffed hemodialysis catheters is catheter-related bacteremia (CRB), which contributes to patient morbidity and loss of vascular access. Gram positive microorganisms are the most common etiologic agents; coagulase negative staphylococcus and corynebacterium species are the two most prevalent strains in our center. These are the common inhabitants of skin flora, suggesting that infection of catheters occur through the exit site. The Biopatch is a chlorhexidine impregnated dressing designed to keep the exit site from colonization with skin flora. This may decrease the incidence of CRB due to organisms from the skin. Objective:?To investigate whether the application of the biopatch at the exit site has any effect on the incidence and the etiology of CRB. Methods:?Chart review of 63 pediatric chronic hemodialysis patients who were dialysed between January 1999 and December 2003 was performed. The mean age at start of hemodialysis was 13.9?±?4.6 years. The pre-Biopatch era started in January 1999 till the end of June 2001, and the Biopatch era started in July 2001 to December 2003. Biopatch was applied at the beginning of every dialysis week after Betadine cleansing of the exit site, which was then covered with a transparent dressing. In the pre-Biopatch era, the exit site was cleansed with Betadine at every dialysis session and then covered with a transparent dressing. Results:?The use of the Biopatch at the exit site caused a significant decrease in the exit site infections. However, contrary to what was expected, there was no decrease in the incidence of CRB. Pre-Biopatch Era Biopatch Era p value Gram positive infections % 76% 76% NS Gram negative infections % 10% 14% NS Polymicrobial infections % 14% 10% NS Total number of infections 108 (19 patients) 143 (29 patients) NS Exit site infections-number 20 (9 patients) 5 (3 patients) p?<?0.05 Conclusion:? The use of the Biopatch decreases exit site infections. However, it fails to decrease the incidence of CRB. It has no effect on the etiologic agent of the bacterial infection.

AB  - When you are working with home HD education you often meet patients who are very afraid of the moment when they are going to puncture the fistula themselves. Our experience is that the patient sometimes can?t concentrate on anything but this moment. For this reason we let the patient try to puncture as soon as possible. We also get many questions from colleges, doctors, and nurses on how to do it. Most of the patients are very successful and prefer to puncture themselves after having tried it. They say that it is less painful if you puncture yourself and we also have a feeling that it is very rare that they are unsuccessful. To get proof for these feelings we made a small inquiry among our patients, asking about how it is to puncture yourself. We sent the inquiry to 30 patients. We also decided to make a film showing how to puncture yourself. We asked some of our home HD patients if they wanted to contribute. The result of this is a video, which is 9?min long, showing how to puncture in different types of fistulas, underarm, overarm, and grafts.

AB  - Introduction:? Vascular access failure is one of the greatest sources of morbidity for chronic hemodialysis patients. Prophylactic and repeated measurement of access flow may be of importance in preventing clotting. The aim of the study was therefore to analyse the cost effectiveness of a shunt surveillance program, which reduces the appearance of occlusion of the vascular access. Methods: The number of vascular access interventions (surgery and radiology) in the period 2001 till 2003 (transonic measurement period, TMP; 63 patients) was compared with a reference period (RP, 1996 till 1998) during which no access flow was measured (58 patients). All measurements were done with Transonic? and interventions according to K/DOQI. Results:?During the RP, 123 vascular access operations (0.71 per patient year) were performed because of occlusion, whereas in the TMP 58 vascular access operations (0.3 per patient year) were performed. During the TMP, 298 angiographic measurements were performed (1.6 per patient year) in the RP 177, (1.0 per patient year). In the TMP, 1652 access flow measurements were performed. In order to prevent one shunt occlusion, 21 access flow measurements had to be performed. Total costs in the TMP (summary of angiography, angiography and PTA, hospitalization days, and operation costs) are reduced with 31% compared to the RP; costs per patient year in RP: ?2315. Costs per patient year in TMP: ?1606. Conclusion:?By means of a shunt surveillance program (based on access flow measurement), if necessary followed by angiography, it is possible to reduce the number of acute vascular access occlusions. Although a shunt surveillance program may take up a lot of time for the nursing staff, the beneficial effects, lower costs, and reduced morbidity for the patients outweigh this effort.

AB  - Purpose:? The use of tunneled, cuffed central venous catheters for hemodialysis is associated with poor flow, thrombosis, and infections due to the transcutaneous nature of these devices. A new design for a sutureless, tunneled cuffed catheter was evaluated in hemodialysis patients to determine the effect of its design on the incidence of exit site infection. Methods:?A polyurethane conduit with a uniquely designed cuff and subcutaneous skirt covered with Dacron velour was attached to standard double lumen central venous catheters. Seven (7) Ash catheters and one (1) Tesio catheter were fitted with the overtube and skirt and implanted in eight (8) patients undergoing routine hemodialysis. Patients were monitored for exit site infection, tunnel infection, bacteremia, cuff extrusion, and serosanguineous exudate. Results:?Catheters were implanted for 6 to 26 weeks. All catheters remained patent and no cases of bacteremia were observed. There was no evidence of exit site or tunnel infection, and no reported serosanguineous exudate from the exit site. Exit site care consisted of soap and water cleansing by the patient. Patients were able to shower or bathe 4 weeks post-implant. Conclusions:?The new design for a subcutaneous cuff and skirt appears to inhibit exit site infection and other common complications of central venous catheters.

AB  - Objective:? To observe the factors that affect the citrate concentration in hollow fiber when using citrate hemodialysate. Methods:?By modeling hemodialysis in vitro, we studied 6 types of hemodialyzers at different blood flow rates, different dialysate flow-rate, and different fluids in vitro to detect the citrate concentration in hollow fiber. Results:?The citrate concentrations in different hemodialyzers were F60?>?FB-130UGA?>?GA-HP130?>?F6?>?FB-130AGA?>?WS-70 in turn. The concentrations at different blood flow-rates were different 100?mL/min?>?200?mL/min. Conclusions:?The concentration of citrate in hollow fiber is affected by different types of hemodialyzers and different blood as well as dialysate flow-rates. To achieve anticoagulation when using citrate hemodialysate, we must select suitable hemodialyzer such as FB-130UGA.

AB  - Objective: To report outcome in dogs after internal fixation of a sarcoma-related pathologic fracture of the appendicular skeleton. Study Design: Multi-institutional case series. Animals: Dogs (n=16). Methods: Medical records of participating VSSO members were reviewed for dogs with pathologic fracture associated with a confirmed bone sarcoma of the appendicular skeleton repaired by external or internal fixation. Dogs were included if they had a histological diagnosis of osteosarcoma or sarcoma and excluded if they had radiation before fracture. Data collected were analyzed for signalment, fracture location, staging performed, method of fracture fixation, histopathology, adjunctive treatment and outcome. Results: Signalment and fracture location of 16 dogs that met the inclusion criteria was similar to dogs with appendicular OSA without fracture. One of 14 dogs had pulmonary metastasis and 3 of 5 dogs had bone metastasis. Bone plate or interlocking nail were used for repair in 12 dogs. Limb use immediately after surgery in 13 dogs was good (4), weight-bearing but lame (7) and non-weight bearing (2). Adjunctive therapy was administered in 5 dogs (chemotherapy, 3; radiation, 4; pamidronate, 3). Survival time ranged from 18 to 897 days; median survival was 166 days. Conclusions: Repair of pathologic fracture can result in palliation and prolonged survival.

Methods Peripheral heparinized plasma and plain serum tube samples were collected preoperatively, and at 2 hr, 1 day, and 4 days postoperatively for analysis o; white blood cells, total lymphocytes, T-helper lymphocytes, T-suppressor lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, plasma C-reactive protein and serum amyloid-A. Twenty-four hours peritoneal fluid collection was performed on days 1 and 4 for TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 analysis. Results No statistical differences were observed between the two groups with respect to immunocompetent cell counts. The serum levels of plasma CRP and SAA gradually increased significantly with time in both groups, but these temporal increases were lower in the LADG group (CRP; P?=?0.03, SAA; P?=?0.01). Peritoneal TNF-α levels in the CODG group at 4 days postoperatively were significantly higher than at day 1, but remained almost unchanged in the LADG group, and this difference was significant (P?=?0.02). Conclusion Because of its association with reduced peritoneal immune activity, laparoscopic surgery for advanced gastric cancer may require careful consideration in practice. Additional, larger prospective multicenter trials are required before a consensus can be reached. J. Surg. Oncol. 2008;98:54?59. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
