AB  - Vacuum Assisted Closure?(or V.A.C.?)* Therapy is the negative pressure wound therapy provided by the V.A.C.? System, available from KCI USA, Inc. This study was conducted in young Yorkshire swine to evaluate the effect of V.A.C.? locally and systemically on wound healing and cytokine levels in wound fluid and tissue and in serum. Two full thickness, excisional wounds were created on the dorsum of swine. In Group 1 (n?=?6), one wound received V.A.C.? Therapy using a polyurethane foam V.A.C.? dressing and 125?mm?Hg continuous negative pressure, and the second wound received DuoDERM?** without negative pressure. Group 2 animals (n?=?4) served as controls and received only DuoDERM? on both wounds. Blood, wound fluid, and biopsy samples were taken at predetermined intervals and the levels of 10 cytokines and growth factors, the acute-phase inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP), and immunoglobulins M & G were tested by ELISA. Preliminary data from the first phase of the study (n?=?2 swine/group) indicated a trend toward lower serum CRP values and higher serum IgM and IgG levels in swine treated with V.A.C.? Therapy compared to controls. The remaining swine are being evaluated to determine whether V.A.C.? Therapy moderates the local inflammatory wound healing response. In addition, testing of splenic lymphocyte and peripheral blood lymphocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte functions are being performed to study possible systemic effects on the immune system.

AB  - Summary Thorough understanding of the complex pathophysiology of osteoarthritis (OA) is necessary in order to open new avenues for treatment. The aim of this study was to characterize the CD4+ T cell population and evaluate their activation and polarization status in OA joints. Fifty-five patients with end-stage knee OA (Kellgren?Lawrence grades III?IV) who underwent surgery for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were enrolled into this study. Matched samples of synovial membrane (SM), synovial fluid (SF) and peripheral blood (PB) were analysed for CD3+CD4+CD8? T cell subsets [T helper type 1 (Th1), Th2, Th17, regulatory T cells] and activation status (CD25, CD69, CD45RO, CD45RA, CD62L) by flow cytometry. Subset-specific cytokines were analysed by cytometric bead array (CBA). SM and SF samples showed a distinct infiltration pattern of CD4+ T cells. In comparison to PB, a higher amount of joint-derived T cells was polarized into CD3+CD4+CD8? T cell subsets, with the most significant increase for proinflammatory Th1 cells in SF. CBA analysis revealed significantly increased immunomodulating cytokines [interferon (IFN)-?, interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-10] in SF compared to PB. Whereas in PB only a small proportion of CD4+ T cells were activated, the majority of joint-derived CD4+ T cells can be characterized as activated effector memory cells (CD69+CD45RO+CD62L?). End-stage OA knees are characterized by an increased CD4+ T cell polarization towards activated Th1 cells and cytokine secretion compared to PB. This local inflammation may contribute to disease aggravation and eventually perpetuate the disease process.

AB  - Abstract American Indian (AI) communities have high levels of stress and trauma and are disproportionately affected by numerous preventable diseases. Here, we describe an academic?community partnership based on a collaboration between Blackfeet Community College students and faculty in Psychology and Immunology at Montana State University (MSU). The collaboration, which has spanned over 5 years, was sparked by community interest in the relationship between stress and disease on the Blackfeet reservation. Specifically, community members wanted to understand how the experience of psychological stress and trauma may affect disease risk in their community and identify factors that promote resilience. In doing so, they hoped to identify pathways through which health could be improved for individual community members. Here, we discuss all stages of the collaborative process, including development of measures and methods and themes of research projects, challenges for community members and non-indigenous collaborators, future directions for research, and the lessons learned. Finally, we note the ways in which this partnership and experience has advanced the science of community engagement in tribal communities, with the hope that our experiences will positively affect future collaborations between indigenous community members and non-indigenous scientists.

AB  - Summary In the United Kingdom, when a patient complains that he/she has impaired vision, the first port of call is frequently an optometrist and if spectacles are not the answer a further referral is made to a hospital through the general practitioner. Unilateral visual field defects that present in this way are commonly caused by focal retinal pathology, congenital optic nerve defects, glaucoma, optic disc drusen, previous trauma, compressive lesions and as chronic sequelae of subclinical branch retinal artery and vein occlusions or demyelinating optic neuritis. The diagnostic problem of progressive bilateral visual loss is usually solvable with a clear understanding of the knowledge of the visual pathways, patterns of visual symptoms and careful examination. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) permits non-cross-sectional imaging of internal structures in biological tissues using near infra-red light. Optic nerve lesions generally lead to monocular visual loss and pain is a frequent accompanying features.

AB  - We aimed to identify statistical predictor variables of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced physical sickness symptoms during the acute and late inflammatory phases using multivariate regression analyses. Data from N?=?128 healthy volunteers who received i.v. LPS injection (0.4 or 0.8?ng/kg) or placebo were pooled for analyses. Physical sickness symptoms experienced during the acute (0?6h postinjection) and late (6?24h postinjection) phases were assessed with the validated General-Assessment-of-Side-Effects (GASE) questionnaire. LPS-treated subjects reported significantly more physical sickness symptoms. Physical symptoms during the acute phase were associated with LPS-induced mood impairments and interleukin (IL)-6 increases, explaining 28.5% of variance in GASE scores. During late phase, LPS-induced increases in cortisol and IL-6 plasma concentrations and baseline depression were significant predictor variables, explaining 38.5% of variance. In patients with recurrent or chronic inflammatory states, these factors may act as risk factors ultimately contributing to an exacerbation of sickness symptoms, and should be considered as potential targets for therapeutic strategies.
