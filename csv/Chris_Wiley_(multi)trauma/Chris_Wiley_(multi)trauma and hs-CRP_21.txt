AB  - In this special issue of Academic Emergency Medicine, the Editorial Board is privileged to present the Original Research Abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM), May 22?25, 2000, San Francisco, CA. The depth, breadth, and future of our specialty and our practice are reflected in these brief research summaries; the creativity, talent, and dedication of our researcher colleagues are documented on these pages. We are honored to be able to share them with you. This year, 990 abstracts were received and considered for presentation at the Annual Meeting. Fifty percent were submitted electronically. Each abstract was evaluated by six to nine independent reviewers who were blinded to the author, the study institution, and the other reviewers. Final determinations for acceptance were made by members of the Scientific Subcommittee, chaired by Judd Hollander, and the Program Committee chair, Sue Stern. These decisions were based on the mean score received after review and the space available for presentations within the program. The type of presentation (oral platform vs poster), the assigned topic section, and the position of presentation in the program were also determined. As was the case last year, we have reproduced these abstracts from electronic versions supplied by the submitting authors. In general, we have not edited, proofread, changed, or corrected the abstracts; they appear as submitted by the authors, who are responsible for their content. Presentation numbers precede the abstract titles. The institution listed is that of the presenting author. A list of common abbreviations used in the abstracts begins on page 596. An index to key words, authors, and topics begins on page 598.

AB  - Objective To compare indicators of systemic inflammatory response in the second trimester in women who developed pre-eclampsia with normal pregnancies. Design Prospective nested case control study derived from a cohort of 2190 pregnant women. Blood samples were obtained at 18 weeks of gestation. The following inflammatory parameters were measured: tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), interleukin-1? (IL-1?), IL-6, IL-10, microCRP and tissue factor (TF). Setting Institute of Medical Genetics, University of Oslo, and Department of Medical Genetics, Ullevål University Hospital and Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Aker University Hospital, Oslo, Norway. Sample The cases were 71 women who subsequently developed pre-eclampsia. The controls were 71 healthy, pregnant women matched for age, parity and first trimester body mass index (BMI). Methods Venous blood was drawn from fasting subjects into 5 mL test tubes containing EDTA. Samples were analysed for inflammatory parameters : IL-1-?, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, PAI-1, TF (ELISA-technique) and CRP (latex-enhanced immunonephelometric assay), strictly according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Main outcome measures The matched case and control subjects were compared by the paired two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test. All P values were two-tailed and P < 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. Results We found no differences in plasma concentrations of PAI-1, IL-1?, IL-6, IL-10, microCRP, TNF-α or TF at 18 weeks of gestation between women who subsequently developed pre-eclampsia and matched control women. Conclusion In contrast to findings from women with overt pre-eclampsia, the present study indicates that there are no indications of intensified systemic inflammatory response at 18 weeks of gestation in women who later develop pre-eclampsia.
