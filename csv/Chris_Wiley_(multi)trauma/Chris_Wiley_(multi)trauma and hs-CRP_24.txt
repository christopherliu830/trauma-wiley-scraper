AB  - Abstract Objective To study the joint distribution and 2-year outcome of patients with recent-onset monoarthritis. Methods Adult patients with clinically apparent monoarthritis of ≤16 weeks? duration were included in a multi-center 2-year longitudinal study. Clinical characteristics, joint distribution, development of chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease (CIRD), as well as classification according to the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (2010 RA criteria) were studied. Predictors for development of CIRD were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression analyses. Results The knee (49.3%), ankle (16.7%) and wrist (14.1%) were the most frequently affected joints among the 347 included patients. Ninety-one patients (26.2%) developed CIRD during follow-up; 21 (6.1%) were diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and 16 (4.6%) with psoriatic arthritis. Longer duration of joint swelling, joint localization, and ACPA- and RF positivity were independent predictors of CIRD. Six of 58 (10.3%) patients with ankle monoarthritis and 21 of 49 (42.9%) patients with wrist monoarthritis developed CIRD during follow-up. The 2010 RA criteria captured all patients diagnosed with seropositive RA at an early stage, mostly within three months. Conclusion Approximately one-fourth of patients with recent-onset monoarthritis developed CIRD over 2 years. Patients presenting with ankle arthritis rarely developed CIRD, whereas patients presenting with wrist arthritis more frequently did so. Longer duration of joint swelling and ACPA- and RF positivity were also predictive of CIRD. Our findings facilitate early identification of monoarthritis patients with unfavorable prognosis.

AB  - Background Postoperative inflammation is a common consequence of surgery and the ensuing stress response. Local anesthetics have anti-inflammatory properties. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate if LA administrated intraperitoneally perioperatively might inhibit expression of inflammatory cytokines. Methods This was a, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study (ClinicalTrial.gov reg no: NCT02256228) in patients undergoing surgery for ovarian cancer. Patients were randomized to receive: intraperitoneal ropivacaine (Group IPLA) or saline (Group P) perioperatively. Except for study drug, patients were treated similarly. At the end of surgery, a multi-port catheter was inserted intraperitoneally, and ropivacaine 2 mg/mL or 0.9% saline, 10 mL was injected intermittently every other hour during 72 hours postoperatively. Systemic expression of cytokines and plasma ropivacaine were determined before and 6, 24, and 48 hours after surgery. Stress response was measured by serum glucose, cortisol, and insulin. Results Forty patients were recruited, 20 in each group. There was no statistical significant difference in systemic cytokine between the groups at any time point. Serum cortisol was significantly lower in the IPLA group at 6 hours, median 103 nmol/L (IQR 53-250) compared to placebo, median 440 nmol/L (IQR 115-885), P = 0.023. Serum glucose and insulin were similar between the groups. Total and free serum concentrations of ropivacaine were well below toxic concentrations. Conclusion In this small study, perioperative intraperitoneal ropivacaine did not reduce the systemic inflammatory response associated with major abdominal surgery. Total and free ropivacaine concentrations were below known toxic concentrations in humans.

AB  - There is evidence that postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a significant problem after major surgery, but the pathophysiology has not been fully elucidated. The interpretation of available studies is difficult due to differences in neuropsychological test batteries as well as the lack of appropriate controls. Furthermore, there are no internationally accepted criteria for defining POCD. This article aims to provide an update of current knowledge of the pathogenesis of POCD with a focus on perioperative pathophysiology and possible benefits achieved from an enhanced postoperative recovery using a fast-track methodology. It is concluded that the pathogenesis of POCD is multifactorial and future studies should focus on evaluating the role of postoperative sleep disturbances, inflammatory stress responses, pain and environmental factors. Potential prophylactic intervention may include minimal invasive surgery, multi-modal non-opioid pain management and pharmacological manipulation of the inflammatory response and sleep architecture.
