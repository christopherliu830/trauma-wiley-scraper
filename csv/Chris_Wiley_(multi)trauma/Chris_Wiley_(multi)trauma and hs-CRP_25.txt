AB  - Abstract Background? Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play a role in the repair and regeneration of the endothelium and may represent a novel cardiovascular risk factor. South Asian subjects have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease which is not fully explained by known risk factors. This study examined associations of EPCs with atherosclerosis and possible ethnic differences in EPCs. Materials and methods? A population sample of 58 European and South Asian adult men was enriched with the recruitment of an additional 59 European and South Asian men with known coronary disease. The coronary artery calcification score was measured by multi-slice computerized tomography (CT), carotid and femoral intima-media thickness (IMT), and femoral plaques were measured by ultrasound. The subjects were further subdivided into three categories of coronary artery disease on the basis of coronary artery calcification score and clinical history. Total EPCs and non-senescent EPCs (ns-EPCs) were quantified after 5 days cell culture and the number of late outgrowth colonies was measured over a 6-week test period. Circulating CD34+ haematopoietic precursor cells were measured by flow cytometry. Results? Individuals with femoral plaques had reduced total and ns-EPCs. The number of ns-EPCs were reduced in individuals with the most coronary atheroma and were inversely related to the coronary calcification score and femoral IMT. These relationships persisted after multivariate adjustment for other risk factors. The numbers of late outgrowth colonies or circulating CD34+ cells were unrelated to the presence of atherosclerosis. There were no differences in the number of EPCs between European and South Asian subjects. Conclusion? The number of EPCs are reduced in subjects with atherosclerosis independent of other risk factors. Reduction in EPC numbers may be an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis but does not explain ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk.

AB  - Abstract Background. Increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is detrimental for the recovery of organ function in trauma and emergency patients. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between the dynamics of IAP and organ dysfunction in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). Materials and methods. Management of SAP between 2000 and 2004 was analysed. SAP was classified according to Atlanta 1992. Organ dysfunction, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and outcomes in relation to the IAP were assessed. IAP was measured indirectly. Results. A total of 65 patients, with an average APACHE II score of 6.44, complied with the Atlanta criteria. In all, 34 patients received conservative treatment and 31 were operated. SIRS was observed in 59 cases and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in 61 cases. IAP was significantly higher in the 25 most complicated patients requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), compared with 40 patients without RRT, 31.72 vs 21.4 cm/H2O (p=0.037). IAP interrelated positively with SOFA score (r =+ 0.371, p<0.01) and organs involved (r =+ 0.356, p<0.01), and negatively with platelet count and enterally provided volume (r =? 0.284, p<0.01; r =? 0.5, p<0.01, respectively). Overall mortality (9.2%) was associated with surgery and sustained increase of the IAP over 25 cm/H2O. Our data support the pathophysiological interrelation of elevated IAP and development of organ dysfunction. Conclusion. Development of organ dysfunction in SAP could be associated with increased IAP. Grade III increase of IAP should be considered as an indicator for revision of treatment modalities.

AB  - ABSTRACT Arthrofibrosis is a common complication following total knee arthroplasty caused by pathologic fibroblast activation and excessive collagen deposition around a synovial joint leading to debilitating loss of motion. Treatment options are limited because the pathologic mechanisms remain to be characterized. Dysregulation of the inflammatory cascade may lead to communication between myofibroblasts and immune cells triggering tissue metaplasia, and excessive collagen deposition described clinically as arthrofibrosis. We explored the novel use of celecoxib (selective cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2] inhibitor) to disrupt the downstream effects of the post-traumatic inflammatory cascade and inhibit scar tissue formation in a validated rabbit model of arthrofibrosis combined with new parameters for quantifying the stiffness of the posterior capsule. Biomechanical and molecular analyses, of contracted rabbit knee posterior capsule tissue after COX-2 inhibition revealed increased maximal passive extension and down-regulation of collagen messenger RNA compared with controls. Histopathologic examination suggested a trend of decreased quantities of dense fibrous connective tissue with COX-2 inhibition. These data may suggest that inhibiting the inflammatory cascade could potentially reduce pathologic myofibroblast activation, thereby reducing scar tissue formation and increasing the range of motion in arthrofibrotic joints. Implementing a multi-modal pharmacologic approach may simultaneously target numerous cellular components contributing to the complex process of arthrofibrogenesis. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - This title is sure to be a turnoff for most surgeons! Neuropathic pain is a term that has been brought to prominence with the marketing of the drug, neurontin. Neuropathic along with nociceptive are two general terms used to classify pain symptoms. Nociceptive often refers to pain symptoms that are amenable to the surgical knife whereas neuropathic often involves more central mechanisms. Management of neuropathic pain is generally based around the use of prescription medication. I will briefly detail what is hot and what is not in neuropathic analgesia. Information will be provided on neuromodulation/surgical techniques that modulate central nervous system transmission. My experience of spinal cord stimulation in a case of extreme CRPS will be presented.

AB  - Background:?? Previous studies have shown that nutritional status affects recovery after elective surgery. The impact of nutritional status in the acute surgical setting has not been well defined. Methods:?? Over a 4?week period consecutive patients admitted for >24?hours under the general surgical service at a tertiary hospital were screened on admission using the subjective global assessment (SGA) nutritional assessment tool. Results:?? Of 332 eligible patients, 310 were screened. Diagnoses at discharge were: Colorectal pathology (28%), Infective (23%), Hepatopancreaticobiliary (15%), upper gastrointestinal (9%), Vascular (5%), trauma (5%), other (15%). 5% had a malignancy diagnosed during their admission. Mean age was 52?years (95% CI 18?84), mean BMI was 28.6?kg/m2 (95% CI 19.2?41.7), and 170 (55%) were female. 48% were deemed well nourished (SGA-A), 40% had moderate/suspected malnutrition (SGA-B) and 12% were severely malnourished (SGA-C). Median (range) hospital stay was 3 (1?20), 5 (1?30) and 7 (2?38)?days (p < 0.001 Kruskal Wallis) for SGA category A to C respectively. Cox regression revealed that SGA was an independent predictor of day stay after taking age, malignancy, sex, albumin, lymphocyte and diagnosis into consideration. Conclusion:?? Nutritional status in the acute surgical setting, as measured by a simple clinical tool predicts duration of hospital stay. Admission nutrition screening may be considered in order to determine nutritional requirements of acute surgical patients.

AB  - Summary Patients may be referred to the immunology clinic for investigation of recurrent superficial abscess formation. In the majority of adult patients this clinical presentation does not equate with an underlying primary immune deficiency. Nevertheless, recurrent mucocutaneous abscesses can be associated with significant morbidity and long-term complications, including scarring and fistula formation, and may be associated with underlying immune-mediated disease. This review sets out an approach to the patient with recurrent superficial abscesses, focusing on the differential diagnoses, investigation and management of both the common causes and those associated with specific immune deficiency.

AB  - Comparison of the University of California (Los Angeles) shoulder scale and the simple shulder test with shoulder pain and disability index: Single-administration reliability and validity. (Texas Woman's University, Houston, TX) Phys Ther. 2000;80:759?768. This study compared 2 shoulder measures?the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) Shoulder Scale and the Simple Shoulder Test (SST)?with the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). One hundred ninety-two patients with shoulder disorders were recruited from one physician's office to complete the self-report sections of the 3 scales. Cronbach alpha values and standard errors of measurements (SEM) were calculated for each of the multi-item subscales. Validity was examined through calculation of correlation coefficients among the 3 scales. Factor analysis was completed to assess the underlying constructs of the SPADI and SST. Cronbach alpha values ranged from 0.85 to 0.95. The SEM values for the multi-item scales ranged from 4.75 to 11.65. Evidence for validity to reflect function was indicated by the correlation between the SST and the SPADI disability subscale. The factor analysis of the SPADI revealed loading on 1 factor, whereas the SST loaded on 2 factors. Conclude that all scales demonstrated good internal consistency, suggesting that all items for each scale measure the same constract. However, SEMS for all scales were high. Factor loading was consistent, suggesting that patients may not distinguish between pain and function. Comment by Philip S. Sizer Jr., MED, PT. Clinical practitioners are leaning toward evaluating functional status versus a pure-impairment-based approach to appraising shoulder limitations. Several scales have been developed for the evaluation of shoulder function, including the University of California Los Angeles Shoulder Scale (UCLA), the Simple Shoulder Test (SST), and the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). Investigations demonstrating the psychometric properties of these scales are limited in number. These investigators attempted to assess those properties, including internal consistency, reliability, and validity for all 3 scales. The analyses demonstrated internal consistency and construct homogeneity for the SPADI. However, all 3 scales demonstrated rather large standard errors of measure, which questions the reliability of the scales for measurement of an individual's progress. Regarding construct validity, the SPADI does not appear to distinguish between pain and dysfunction, disqualifying its use as a gold standard for comparison with other scales. While the SST purports to measure a single construct, the data suggests that it appears to measure 2 different constructs namely function and comfort. Additionally, the analyses appear to demonstrate that, while the scales may attempt to measure the same constructs, they apparently do not. Finally, the authors suggest that the precision of the UCLA scale is inferior to the other 2 scales and insufficient for following the progress of individual patients in the clinical setting.
