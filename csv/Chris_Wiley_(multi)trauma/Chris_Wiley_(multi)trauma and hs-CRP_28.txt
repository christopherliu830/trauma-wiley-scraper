AB  - Abstract Our objective was to investigate the initiation and course of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in early inflammatory response and to elucidate the cytokine system in relation to the adrenal response caused by stress. Seven blood samples were collected, pre- and postoperatively (0?72?h) after total hip replacement (THR) due to osteoarthritis. The following cytokines were measured using Cytometric Bead Array: interleukin-1? (IL-1?), IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-α, IL-8, IL-12 and IL-10 (B Wilcoxon test P?<?0.01) Repeated measurements were also significant (Friedman P?<?0.05). The concentration of IL-8 doubled the day of surgery but did not reach a significant level (Friedman test =0.069). None of the other cytokines showed any significant changes. The diurnal cortisol rhythm was interrupted after the surgery and there was a significant correlation between the cortisol secretion and IL-6 response. This study demonstrates an isolated elevation in IL-6 levels with only a minor elevation in IL-8 following THR. This pro-inflammatory response seemed to decline without activation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10), but cortisol seemed to play a complicated role in halting the acute inflammatory response.

AB  - Summary Increased peripheral levels of cytokines and central microglial activation have been reported in patients with psychiatric disorders. The degree of both innate and adaptive immune activation is also associated with worse clinical outcomes and poor treatment response in these patients. Understanding the possible causes and mechanisms leading to this immune activation is therefore an important and necessary step for the development of novel and more effective treatment strategies for these patients. In this work, we review the evidence of literature pointing to childhood trauma as one of the main causes behind the increased immune activation in patients with psychiatric disorders. We then discuss the potential mechanisms linking the experience of early life adversity (ELA) to innate immune activation. Specifically, we focus on the innervation of the bone marrow from sympathetic nervous system (SNS) as a new and emerging mechanism that has the potential to bridge the observed increases in both central and peripheral inflammatory markers in patients exposed to ELA. Experimental studies in laboratory rodents suggest that SNS activation following early life stress exposure causes a shift in the profile of innate immune cells, with an increase in proinflammatory monocytes. In turn, these cells traffic to the brain and influence neural circuitry, which manifests as increased anxiety and other relevant behavioural phenotypes. To date, however, very few studies have been conducted to explore this candidate mechanism in humans. Future research is also needed to clarify whether these pathways could be partially reversible to improve prevention and treatment strategies in the future.

Data show that thalamocortical, basal ganglia, midbrain and hindbrain circuits play important roles in seizure generation, conduction and modulation. The session will provide a basic overview of these systems and circuits, both functionally and anatomically. The thalamus uses systems able to synchronize or desynchronize electrical activity in wide regions of cortex. These thalamocortical systems play a role in generation of absence seizures and propagation of secondarily generalized seizures. The basal ganglia have a close relationship with the cortex, and may ?gate? activity through a widespread corticostriate system, thus potentially both enhancing and suppressing seizure activity. Midbrain and hindbrain circuits have been shown to have profound effects on seizures. The session will discuss how an understanding of subcortical-cortical networks can lead to therapeutic advances, with use of electrical brain stimulation or targeted pharmacotherapy as examples.

AB  - Summary Dementia and cognitive impairment are very common and accompany many neurological as well as systemic diseases. This chapter first talks about delirium, dementia and cognitive impairment. Cognition, like other aspects of human brain function, has a modular organisation, and different cognitive functions have distinct anatomical substrates. The chapter then focuses on the differential diagnosis of delirium and dementia, and a structured approach to the investigation of cognitive impairment. Alzheimer's disease is the prototypical cortical dementia against which other dementias are compared in a differential diagnosis. The prion diseases are transmissible agents with unique composition and properties, being apparently devoid of significant nucleic acid. The greatest risk factor for development of dementia is age. However, there are several modifiable risk factors. Moderate exercise reduces the risk of dementia as does modification of vascular risk factors: obesity, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, hypertension and smoking.

AB  - Abstract Patients with heart failure (HF) are at an increased risk of stroke, sudden death and venous thromboembolism, which are all linked to thrombus formation (thrombogenesis). The present ?viewpoint? article will discuss how the prothrombotic state in HF may be perpetuated by a chronic inflammatory state that is maladaptive. Indeed, there is considerable evidence that thrombogenesis and endothelial (dys)function can be intimately linked to inflammation in HF.
