AB  - Regional pain syndrome: a distinct clinical entity associated with HLA-DR13. (Leiden University Medical center. Leiden, The Netherlands) Ann Neurol 2000;48:113?116. This report discussed 26 patients with a distinct phenotype of complex regional pain syndrome that progressed toward a multifocal or generalized tonic dystonia. The dystonia initiated distally, involved mainly flexor muscles, and was associated with sensory and autonomic symptoms. Dryness of the eyes or mouth and bladder and bowel disturbances were frequently reported. There was no increase in the familial prevalence of autoimmune-mediated disease. Compared with controls, a significant elevation of HLA-DR13 was found in the patients. Thus, HLA-DR13 may be a factor indicating susceptibility to this distinct phenotype of complex regional pain syndrome.

AB  - A novel biopolymer composed of porcine gelatin and dextran was used in a randomized controlled pilot clinical trial to treat diabetic foot ulcers to establish safety profile and evaluate effect on wound closure. Fifty-six patients were prospectively randomized at 10 centers (control?=?25; E-Matrix?=?31). Control patients received routine sharp debridement, off-loading, and hydrogel dressings applied daily. E-Matrix patients received identical wound care with the addition of monthly subcutaneous injections of E-Matrix under the wound surface. Patients were monitored for 12 weeks using wound planimetry and photography. Primary endpoint was safety as measured by adverse event reporting and clinical laboratory analysis. Secondary endpoint was wound closure based on intent to treat. There was no significant difference in the rate of adverse events between treated and control subjects. Overall closure rate for E-Matrix treated wounds was 42%(13 of 31 subjects) compared to 32%(8 of 25 subjects) for controls. Subgroup analysis suggested that E-Matrix may be more effective than control for treatment of larger (>2?cm2) and older (>17 weeks duration) wounds (see table). Parameter Treatment Group N Closed %Closed Size >2?cm E-Matrix 17 8 47% Control 14 4 29% Ulcer duration >17 weeks E-Matrix 15 6 40% Control 15 3 20% Although the study is insufficiently powered to evaluate statistical significance, E-Matrix demonstrated a similar safety profile to control treatment with trends toward improved healing in larger and older wounds. Further randomized trials are necessary to confirm these promising initial results.

AB  - Abstract Background The metabolism of the essential trace element copper remains incompletely understood and, until recently, nearly ignored in acute medicine. Menkes disease was for long the only known copper deficiency condition, but several case reports and investigations conducted over the last 2 decades have shown that deficiency is more frequent than previously suspected, with devastating individual consequences and potential public health consequences. The copper needs in healthy individuals are 0.9 mg/d, which translates to 0.3 mg/d intravenously in parenteral nutrition; the present review aims at gathering actual knowledge. Method and results A review of literature was conducted in PubMed and Cochrane systematic reviews to identify the most recent information about copper deficiency and generate a narrative review. Copper deficiency has hereditary and acquired origins, the latter being the most frequent. Clinical manifestations are nonspecific but affect all organs and systems, particularly the hematologic (anemia) and the neurologic (myeloneuropathy) systems. Deficiency also affects the cardiovascular, cutaneous, and immune systems. Severe copper deficiency due to reduced absorption after bariatric bypass surgery has become frequent. Conclusion Deficiency is more frequent than previously recognized, probably because of changing nutrition patterns but also because of some treatments that have become very common such as bypass bariatric surgery and, in acute medicine, prolonged continuous renal replacement therapy. The patients may present with severe hematologic and neurologic complications that go untreated because copper deficiency was not considered in the differential diagnosis: These complications often need active intravenous repletion with doses 4?8 times the usual nutrition recommendations.

AB  - Introduction:? Growth factors have been shown to affect the complex cascade of wound healing; however, interaction between different growth factors during dermal and epidermal regeneration are still not entirely defined. In the present study we determined the interaction between keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), an epidermal growth factor, administered as liposomal cDNA, with other dermal and epidermal growth factors and collagen types I, III, and IV synthesis in an acute wound. Method:? Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received 30% total body surface area scalds under general anesthesia. They were then divided into two groups to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of liposomes plus the Lac Z gene (0.2??g, vehicle), or liposomes plus the KGF cDNA (2.2??g) and Lac Z gene (0.2??g), for 4 weeks. Immunological assays, histological, and immunohistochemical techniques were used to determine growth factor concentrations and different types of collagen (I, III, and IV), rate of reepithelialization and dermal morphology, after KGF cDNA gene transfer. Results:? KGF cDNA transfer significantly increased IGF-I (Insulin-like Growth Factor-I), IGFBP-3 (Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein-3), and FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor) and decreased TGF-?(Transforming Growth Factor?beta) levels (p?<?0.05). KGF had no effect on PDGF (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor). KGF cDNA significantly increased collagen type IV (p?<?0.02) at the wound edge as well as the wound bed, while it had no effect on collagen type I and III. KGF cDNA significantly increased reepithelialization compared to the control group. Conclusion:? Exogenous KGF cDNA increases IGF-I, IGF-BP3, FGF expression and decreases TGF-? concentration in an acute wound. It accelerates re-epithelialization, improves dermal morphology and increases basement membrane formation, without a concomitant increase in inflammation or scarring. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Purpose:?? Providing enteral supplements containing ?immunonutrition? has been proposed to decrease postoperative complications and duration of hospital stay for elective surgical patients. This meta-analysis was undertaken to elucidate the potential benefit of providing immune-enhanced nutrition in surgical patients. Methodology:?? A search of Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, PubMed and the Cochrane Database identified all RCTs comparing the use of perioperative immunonutrition with standard nutrition provision in elective adult surgical patients between 1990 and 2008. The variables analysed included mortality, total complications, infective complications, anastomotic leak and length of hospital stay. Results:?? 21 distinct studies were identified that met inclusion criteria involving 2135 patients (immunonutrition n = 1100; standard nutrition n = 935). The provision of immunonutrition was shown to be associated with significant reductions in the incidence of total postoperative complications (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37, 0.69, p < 0.0001), postoperative infective complications (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37, 0.60, p < 0.0001), anastomotic breakdown (OR 0.43, 95% 0.25, 0.75, p = 0.003), and the duration of hospital stay (WMD ?2.95, 95% CI ?4.01, ?1.88, p < 0.0001) when compared to standard nutritional provision. No differences were seen between interventions with relation to mortality (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.41, 1.97. p = 0.8). Conclusion:?? Provision of immunonutrition in preference to standard nutrition was associated with clinically significant decreased length of hospital stay, reduction in the development of postoperative complications including those of infective origin and anastomotic breakdown but has no impact on mortality.

AB  - Introduction:?? Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide including Australia. Adjuvant chemotherapy improved survival in patients with Dukes? C CRC. Yet, not all Dukes? C CRC are referred to medical oncology and subsequently received adjuvant chemotherapy. Purposes:?? To analyse factors influencing referral to medical oncology in patients with Dukes? C Colonic cancer in our institutions. Methods:?? Prospective database on patients underwent resection for CRC, was collected at our institutions between 1991 to July 2007. Univariate and multivariate analysis of factors including demographic, institution based, timing of surgery, complications and length of hospitalisation on the pattern of medical oncology referral. P value of 0.05 or less was considered to be significant. Results:?? 466 patients were identified to have Dukes? C colonic cancer, 251 (53.9%) females and 215 (46.1%) males. 272 (58.4%) were referred to medical oncology. Univariate analysis revealed Age, Sex, ASA grade, underwent resection in private hospitals and underwent elective resection were statistically significant associated with medical oncology referrals. Age, underwent elective resection and underwent resection in private hospitals were the independent factors on multivariate analysis. The probability of medical oncology referral in those underwent elective resection was 63% vs. 41% in those underwent emergency resection, similarly 69% in those underwent resection in private hospitals vs. 50% in public hospitals. Conclusion:?? Referrals to medical oncology for adjuvant chemotherapy in Dukes? C colonic cancer were more likely in younger patients, underwent elective resection and underwent surgery in private hospitals.

AB  - The goal of this study was to specifically estimate the effectiveness of Becaplermin, which is recombinant human platelet derived growth factor (rhPDGF). This was the first FDA-approved growth factor therapy for the treatment of diabetic neuropathic foot ulcer (DNFU). The previously published pivotal trials have shown that those who used rhPDGF were about 35%(i.e., a relative risk (RR) of about 1.35) more likely to heal by the 20th week of care. In our study treatment effectiveness was estimated in a retrospective cohort study, controlling for treatment selection bias using propensity scores derived from logistic regression. The cohort that we studied were patients with a DNFU treated at a Curative Health Services-affiliated wound care center between 1998?2004. We noted 25,098 individuals with a DNFU and overall about 10% received rhPDGF. We were able to successfully create a propensity score model such that the distributions of patient age and gender, wound duration, wound area, wound grade, treating center, and wound location were evenly balanced between those who received rhPDGF and those who did not. The RR for a wound to heal after treatment with rhPDGF as compared to standard care after 20 weeks of care at a wound care center was 1.33 (1.28, 1.38). With respect to amputation, the RR for having an amputation after receiving rhPDGF was 0.86 (0.77, 0.97). In conclusion, rhPDGF is more effective than standard therapy in both helping a wound to heal and preventing amputation. The effectiveness of rhPDGF with respect to getting a wound to heal is similar ?in this real-world setting? as the efficacy estimates from the previously published randomized controlled trials. Acknowledgments:? Funding for this study was provided by Ethicon to the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania.

AB  - Introduction:?? Infarction of the greater omentum is a rare entity representing 0.1% of the total laparotomies performed for acute abdomen. Materials and Methods:?? Prospectively collected data was retrospectively analysed for the last three calendar years from Jan 2006 to Dec 2008. A total of five cases of Primary Omental torsions were identified of which four were managed laparoscopically and one was managed conservatively. Discussion:?? The cause of Primary (Idiopathic) segmental infraction of the greater Omentum is unknown. The possible mechanisms are arterial micro thrombosis or venous thrombosis secondary to stretching of the Omental veins, and precipitating factors such anomalous arterial supply to the omentum, kinking of vein secondary to increase intra-abdominal pressure and vascular congestion after large meals have been suggested. Here we present five cases, all males, ranging from ages of 23 to 55?years with a primary presenting complaint of abdominal pain. Only one of these had a previous appendectomy while two had other abdominal surgeries. The working diagnosis was that of an acute abdomen and four of these underwent laparoscopy and Omentectomy. One of them was conservatively managed. Postoperatively there was an immediate relief of pain and the recovery was uneventful with no mortality. Conclusion:?? The aim of this article is to share our experience in the diagnosis and management of this rare condition successfully with minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery in our regional centre, and a brief review of the literature.

AB  - Purpose:?? Burnout is the state of prolonged physical, emotional, and psychological exhaustion characteristic of individuals working in human service occupations. This study examines the prevalence of burnout among Younger Fellows of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS), and its relationship to demographic variables. Methodology:?? In March 2008, a survey was sent via email to 1,287 Younger Fellows. This included demographic questions, a measure of burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory), and an estimate of social desirability (Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale ? Form C). Results:?? The sample comprised 278 participants ? an overall response rate of 21.6%. Females exhibited higher levels of personal burnout and work-related burnout, but no significant difference in patient-related burnout. Younger Fellows in hospitals with less than 50 beds reported significantly higher patient-related burnout levels. An equal work division between public and private practice resulted in higher work-related burnout than concentration of work in one sector. Younger Fellows working more than 60?hours per week reported significantly higher personal burnout than those who worked less than this. There was no significant correlation between age, country of practice, surgical specialty and any of the burnout subscales. Conclusion:?? Female surgeons, surgeons that work in smaller hospitals, those that work more than 60?hours per week, and those with practice division between the private and public sectors, are at a particularly high risk of burnout. Further enquiry into potentially remediable causes for the increased burnout in these groups is indicated.

AB  - Introduction:?? Enhanced Recovery Programs (EPR) have been shown to reduce mortality, morbidity and length of stay. Can similar results be produced in tertiary centres with the presence of complex colorectal cases? Method:?? 102 patients were prospectively analysed with a power calculation of 34 being established prior to commencement of the study. The average age was 66.6 (male: female ratio of 1:1). Data collection included demographics, operative procedure, pain scores, POSSUM scores, American Society of Anaesthiology (ASA) scores, and discharge times. All complications were documented. Results:?? 83 cases were open procedures and 19 laparoscopically, (3 were converted intra-operatively). The majority were anterior resection (47, [46.1%]) and right hemicolectomies (32, [31.3%]). The average overall discharge time was 11.75?days compared to 15.11 (p < 0.001) prior to commencement of the study in 2005. Anterior resections and subtotal colectomies (14.3 and 13.7?days respectively) had significantly longer lengths of stay compared to right hemicolectomies (10.7?days) [p < 0.001]. 56% patients were ASA grade 3 & 4 (50% and 6% respectively). A clear correlation with increasing ASA and discharge time was demonstrated (ANOVA p = 0.0004) with significant exponential rise with ASA greater than 2. POSSUM scoring demonstrated a positive correlation with prolonged hospital stay with increasing scores having worse discharge time. Conclusion:?? In the presence of complex major surgery and tertiary centre referrals an ERP is feasible producing an average saving of 3.36?days. The benefit is however less with increasing ASA and POSSUM Scores. It however still produced an average economic bed stay saving cost of $3700 per patient stay.
