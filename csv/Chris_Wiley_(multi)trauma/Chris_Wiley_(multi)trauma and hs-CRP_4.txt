AB  - Purpose:? To analyze survival and causes of mortality in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) diabetic patients treated by hemodialysis. Methods:? Data of 1203 ESRD hemodialyzed patients between 1975 and 2002 were analyzed, 116 patients were excluded and 1087 patients included in the study. We studied the prevalence of the diabetic nephropathy, the rate of survival and causes of death by comparing diabetic patients with a control group of patients without diabetes. Results:? Among the 1087 patients requiring dialysis, 272 (25%) were diabetic and 815 non-diabetic whose causal nephropathy was nephroangiosclerosis 32%, glomerulonephritis 15%, chronic interstitial nephropathy 14%, and others 14%. The diabetics were older at the beginning of dialysis than non-diabetic patients: 60.33?±?11.39 years vs. 52.23?±?17.20 years, p?<?0.001. Average time on dialysis is more important in non-diabetic than diabetic group [5.90?±?5.73 years vs. 2.71.?±?2.48 years, p?<?0.001]. The rate of death was higher in diabetics than in control group [71.7% vs. 55.8%, respectively, p?<?0.003]. The difference in survival between the two groups remains significant for the same age. Death caused by cardiovascular disorders is higher in diabetics (68.8%) than non-diabetics (31.2%) (p?<?0.05). Among death causes, stroke is the most frequent cause in diabetics (18.4% vs. 11.6%) in non-diabetics, p?<?0.05. Death by heart failure and infections is higher in diabetics but the difference is not statistically significant (12.3% in diabetics vs. 9.4% in non-diabetics for heart failure and 13.8% vs. 11.4% for infections). Death due to neoplasms is higher in non-diabetics (4.39% vs. 1.02% in diabetics, p?<?0.05). Conclusion:? In our cohort, mortality in diabetic patients is higher than in non-diabetic patients. Cardio-vascular disorders are the most cause of death in diabetics and above all stroke, whereas mortality due to neoplasms is higher in non-diabetic patients. Diabetes is an important risk factor of mortality in hemodialysis patients.

AB  - Purpose:? Several studies have showed that nocturnal home hemodialysis (NHD, 6 times weekly 6?8?h) results in a better outcome. How do patients and their partners experience this very intensive treatment that has a great impact on daily life? Methods:? We followed a cohort of 12 patients (11 male, 1 female, mean age 46.8?±?9.4 years, time for renal replacement 11.3?±?9.4 years) and their partners during a year after starting NHD, using questionnaires and interviews and the SF-36. Results:? Both the physical and the mental components of the SF-36 showed an improvement in all aspects (p?<?0.05), even in this small group. All couples considered NHD a tremendous improvement over routine thrice weekly dialysis. The drawbacks (such as daily routine and the intrusion of the treatment in bed) are outweighed by the advantages (such as better clinical condition, less fatigue, less uremic symptoms, better quality of life, more time, and free diet). Following are a few comments on NHD: ?NHD is a difference of day and night,??NHD gave me independence,??Since I do NHD, I do aerobics,??I am becoming too fat now!,??My husband now is much faster than I am when we walk or ride the bicycle,??There is no reason now why I won't live long,??I got an excellent, but demanding new job, which is possible thanks to NHD,??Being a good team is a prerequisite for success,??Don't expect too much. You will remain a chronic patient,??Become confident with ?conventional? home hemodialysis first before you start NHD.? Conclusion:? NHD results in a tremendous improvement of quality of life. However, patients and partners need active support.

AB  - The Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH) has dialyzed >320 patients with ESRD since 1993. Objective:? To identify differences, and their causes, in the practice of dialysis between Nigerian state-owned dialysis units and U.S.A. Methods:? We analyzed the characteristics of chronic dialysis at JUTH. Results:? At JUTH, chronic dialysis is started at development of frank uremia (K/DOQI standard: creatinine clearance >10?mL/min, no overt uremia). Frequency of hemodialysis was 3 times weekly in 2 patients, twice weekly in 1 and once weekly or longer in 7 patients. Breakdowns in the dialysis machinery, which is outdated, forced additional decreases in the frequency of dialysis. Duration of a dialysis session was 4?h by prescription, but much longer in several sessions because of dialysis machine breakdown during the session (US standard: 4?h). 2 patients were dialyzed through arterio-venous fistulas and 8 patients were dialyzed though temporary femoral vein dialysis catheters removed after each dialysis session. A vascular surgeon was unavailable. The urea reduction ratio was 45.38.6% (U.S.A target: 65%). The cost of the first dialysis session at JUTH is $160. With reuse of dialysis supplies, including dialyzers, dialysis tubing, femoral catheters, and guide wires, the cost of each subsequent dialysis session is $33. The minimal cost of dialysis with 3 dialysis sessions weekly and a new dialyzer every week is $501 per month. The cost of dialysis is borne exclusively by the patient. For comparison, average monthly income is $74 for unskilled laborers, $222 for dialysis technicians, $296 for dialysis nurses, and $889 for academic nephrologists. The low dose of dialysis has adverse effects on patient quality of life (frequent admissions with uremia). Despite notable exceptions (2 patients on dialysis for 12 and 9 years, respectively), survival of dialysis patients at JUTH appears to be poor. Conclusions:? Underdialysis is frequent in Nigeria and is the consequence of socioeconomic conditions and technologic deficits. Removal of the economic burden of dialysis from the patients with ESRD is the first logical step toward correction of underdialysis.

AB  - Heparin-free anticoagulation in hemodialysis (HD) is advocated for patients with clotting abnormalities and risk of bleeding. Objective:? First publication on regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) in children. RCA is free from systemic effects, guarantees excellent dialyzer life, but requires careful monitoring. Methods:? We report on 3 patients treated by intermittent RCA HD (4?h each, high-flux dialyzer F40, Fresenius): (1) 17-year-old boy (renal transplant failure, access via cubital Cimino fistula) after hypertensive intra-cerebral hemorrhage (2 sessions); (2) 13-year-old girl (hemolytic uremic syndrome, access via jugular vein Shaldon catheter) after abdominal surgery and bleeding (8 sessions); and (3) 7-year-old boy (hyperoxaluria, access via PermCath? jugular vein catheter) after renal transplant biopsy (3 sessions). Sodium citrate 30% was infused into the extra corporeal circuit (blood flow 150?mL/min) before dialyzer (initial flow 30?mL/min) and calcium gluconate 10% for antidote into venous line near of catheter or fistula (initial flow 40?mL/min). Post-dialyzer extracorporeal serum Ca++ (aim?<?0.3?mmol/L) and pre-dialyzer intra-corporeal Ca++ (aim?>?0.9) were measured for every 30?min. Serum Na+, K+, base excess (BE), blood flow, blood pressure, heart rate, and blood out-flow and in-flow pressure were also monitored. Results:? For adequate RCA (mean extracorporeal serum Ca++ 0.24?±?0.04?mmol/L), a mean citrate flow of 36.1?±?5.9?mL/h and a mean calcium substitution rate of 40.8?±?3.4?mL/h were needed. Intra-corporeal Ca++ was kept at 1.10?±?0.07?mmol/L. Extracorporeal activated clotting time (ACT) was 194?±?41 and intra-corporeal ACT 90?±?12?sec. Serum Na+, K+, and BE during HD were 138?±?2, 3.5?±?0.3, and ?0.6?±?1.1?mmol/L, respectively. Mean arterial blood pressures of patients 1?3 were 117?±?5, 103?±?5, and 102?±?6?mmHg. All patients were stable and without any bleeding during HD. The only adverse event was 1 episode of hypocalcemia (Ca++?<?0.6?mmol/L) cured by stopping dialysis. Conclusions:? Local anticoagulation with sodium citrate during intermittent HD can be applied safely in children and adolescents.

AB  - It is unlikely that there is a solitary hospital-based dialysis unit that can claim an unlimited amount of available chronic spots. Many units, in fact, constantly face a problem of overcrowding, long patient waiting lists, and ongoing shortages of nurses trained in highly specialized areas such as dialysis. In addition, conventional dialysis does not afford the best outcomes to patients with lifestyle, fluid control, hypotension, or hypertension issues. Objective:? We developed an in-hospital nocturnal program with the goal of solving some of these issues related to wait lists, overcrowding, and shortages of trained hemodialysis nurses. Method:? In the first year, a four-bed room was converted into a 4 station unit. Nurses from the 24 bed in-patient Nephrology/Urology/Ophthalmology unit were trained to perform hemodialysis. Stable, hospitalized dialysis patients or in-center dialysis patients were selected if they met criteria drawn up by the medical director. Staffing for the unit was established at 3?:?1 or 4?:?1 patient to nurse ratio. Support staff included a hemodialysis-trained ward nurse with an assignment of 5?6 hospitalized patients. Back-up support included assistance with trouble-shooting and break coverage for the nocturnal nurse. Results:? We currently have 12 nurses from the ward trained to do hemodialysis. The nocturnal unit has been operating 3 nights/week, with plans to expand to 6 nights/week within the year. We have 3 patients on the program with plans to increase to 6?8 patients as more nurses are trained. Initiation of hospital-based nocturnal hemodialysis has led to the opening of in-center dialysis spots as well as shortening wait periods for patients in the Pre-Renal Clinic, awaiting initiation of chronic dialysis. This model has also provided the in-center dialysis unit with a greater pool of skilled hemodialysis nurses to draw from during shortages. Anecdotal reports from patients indicate that they feel much better, and 1 patient no longer requires antihypertensives for their blood pressure control. Conclusion:? We conclude that hospital-based nocturnal hemodialysis is a novel and extremely viable solution for many of the issues facing dialysis units today.

AB  - Low serum albumin, high serum phosphorus, and fluid overload are common issues in dialysis patients. This can be attributed to many causes such as inadequate understanding and lack of accountability in the patients' care. These abnormal levels contribute to increased medical complications and increased mortality. Objective:? (i) Improve patient education of albumin, phosphorus, and fluid maintenance. (ii) Improve patients' albumin, phosphorus, and fluid levels by 25 percent. Methods:? A baseline level was collected on all patients by averaging last 3 laboratory findings. All patients were educated recognizing several different learning styles. Educational posters were displayed, one-on-one education was provided, as well as educational games on the role of albumin, phosphorus, and fluid. Patients were also educated on the role of diet in these levels. Positive reinforcement, peer pressure, and intensive team approach were used through the 8-week incentive contest. Feedback on progress was provided in written and verbal format. Prizes were awarded for best shift levels and shift with most improvements. Results:? Levels measured at the end of the educational period and contest showed a 71% improvement in albumin levels, 52% improvement in phosphorus levels, and a 42% improvement in fluid levels. Conclusion:? Significant improvements found in all areas are attributed to three factors: education, consistent, individual, intensive attention, and incentives. Peer pressure was found not to be as effective but that individual tracking for incentives may be more effective if done ongoing. Our follow up several months later found a slight decrease in improvements, and we recognize a need for an ongoing intervention. Yet, we found an overall improvement of level of understanding and commitment to their overall health.

AB  - The aim of this cross-sectional study is to assess quality of life (QOL) in 119 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and 89 hemodialysis (HD) patients using the SF-36 instrument (PF?=?physical function, RP?=?role limitations physical, BP?= bodily pain, GH?=?general health perceptions, VT?=?vitality, SF?=?social function, RE?=?role limitations emotional, MH?=?mental health, MCS?=?mental summary, and PCS?= physical summary). The mean (range) s-creatinine in the CKD group was 325??mol/L (133?809??mol/L). There were no differences in SF-36 scores between CKD and HD patients (Figure). CKD/HD status did not predict MCS or PCS in multivariate analyses controlling for age (p?<?0.01 for PCS), sex, depression (p?=?0.01 for PCS), Charlson comorbidity score (p?<?0.01 for PCS), s-albumin (p?=?0.05 for PCS), hemoglobin, presence of partner, and level of education. We conclude that QOL is related to comorbid illness and decreases even before dialysis is started. Longitudinal studies of QOL in CKD patients are needed to evaluate the influence of dialysis initiation on QOL.

AB  - Daily hemofiltration (D-HF) is a new treatment modality that shows unique solute removal characteristics and possibly provides high quality of life for patients with end-stage renal disease. Objective:? To evaluate solute-removal characteristics of D-HF by kinetic modeling analysis. Methods:? Five HD patients with normal 4?h???3 times/week were switched to D-HF (2?h???6 times/week). Ultrafiltration rates (QF) or small solute clearances were approximately 100?mL/min. All the necessary kinetic parameters were determined from patients' physical data and HD portion of the clinical measurements. The two-compartment kinetic model predicted the concentration changes after switching from normal HD to D-HF. Results:? Concentrations of small solutes such as urea?nitrogen (UN) increased, whereas that of ?2-microglobulin (?2-MG) decreased after switching from normal HD to D-HF (Figure?1). Predicted solute concentrations for UN as well as ?2-MG correlated well with the clinical results. The model predicted that QF?=?140?mL/min may be required for time-averaged concentration (TAC) of UN to be unchanged. The model also predicted that the 7-times/week D-HF may not increase the TAC of UN very much even after switching from normal HD to D-HF. Conclusion:? D-HF is suitable for removing larger solutes but may not be good enough for removing small solutes. A 7-day treatment (7 times/week) may greatly improve the solute removal capacity of the so-called daily treatment (6 times/week) not only for larger solutes but also for small solutes.

AB  - Introduction:? In 2001 our Renal Dialysis Unit underwent a major renovation to five stations. The new space and funding allowed for acquisition of new state-of-the-art hemodialysis machines. We describe our experience with the Gambro Phoenix with Diascan and Exalis. Prior to the move an evaluation was undertaken. Criteria for selection with a scoring tool were utilized to rate machine performance for use in children. The decision for the Gambro Phoenix machine was based on: the performance rated highly due to ease of set up; large viewing touch screen; compatibility with existing equipment; benefits of online clearance monitoring (Diascan); network data management system (Exalis) and the future availability of blood volume monitoring (Hemoscan). Our program was the first center to dialyze a pediatric patient on the Phoenix machine in Canada. Patients and results:? 13 patients (age 2?23 years) were hemodialyzed between May 2002 and September 2003 for periods of 2?week to 16 months, greater than 5000?h of dialysis time. The move was not uneventful. During the first months of operation issues such as inadequate electrical supply for the new machines, reverse osmosis (RO) pump failure, leaks, and no emergency power to the RO were prevalent. The new software also exposed glitches. Subsequent Phoenix use proceeded uneventfully. Staff were able to problem solve easily with clinical and technical support from Gambro Canada. Education for the online clearance monitoring, Diascan and Exalis, was necessary. No major problems with dialysis were encountered. The benefits and reliability of Diascan have been previously described (Lindsay RM, Sternby J, Semin Dial. 2001; 14:300). Diascan readings provided real-time measurement of sodium (Na), which correlated well with laboratory values. Automatic readouts of Kt/V allowed for monitoring of dialysis adequacy which was consistent with calculated percent reduction in urea (PRU). At this point, use of the Phoenix has been demonstrated to work well in a pediatric facility.

AB  - Substantial morbidity occurs within the hemodialysis population due to complications of vascular access, most frequently manifests as thrombotic events. An access management goal was the reduction of thrombotic events and associated morbidity. Intra-dialytic vascular access blood flow (ABF) measurements using Crit-Line Delta H ABF have been previously shown to provide objective and accurate access flow data and were our primary method of evaluating access function. A designated ?access manager? was assigned responsibility to track all issues related to vascular access. Each patient's ABF was measured monthly and the flow ?trend? was graphed using Crit-Line Access Manager software. Additional data, including auscultation, cannulation difficulties, failing URR, and increased venous pressures were also recorded. These data and ABF trends were used to establish an angiography ?hot list?. Following angioplasty, ABF was again measured to confirm a successful intervention. The ?hot list? led to 43 angiography referrals of which 83.7% (36/43) required subsequent intervention resulting in significant reductions of thrombosis events in PTFE grafts and native fistulae. The annual incidence of thrombotic events decreased from 1.6 to 0.4 events/patient year in grafts and 0.5?0.0 events in fistulae. Additionally, the percentage of URR's?>?70 increased from 82.3 to 90.1% over the same time period. Use of the Crit-Line Delta H ABF device in conjunction with a vascular access management program can significantly reduce the number of thrombotic events per patient year.

AB  - Serum level of nitrite plus nitrate (NO2 plus NO3), endothelin-1 (Et-1), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) have been estimated in 20 patients with end stage renal failure (ESRF) undergoing regular hemodialysis treatment in a trial to explain the hypotension occurring in some of these patients. According to the incidence of hypotension, patients were divided into GI (n?=?10) hypotension prone patients and GII (n?=?10) hypotension resistant patients (normotensive). Clinical examination with measurement of systolic and mean arterial blood pressure was performed in all cases before and after hemodialysis (HD) settings. After HD, GI showed significant increase in the serum levels of (NO2 plus NO3), IL-1, and TNF-α, whereas a significant decrease in serum Et-1 level was noticed. GII showed no significant change in serum level of the 4 parameters mentioned above. In hypotensive patients, there was a significant positive correlation between (NO2 plus NO3) and the duration of dialysis, and a significant negative correlation between (NO2 plus NO3) and post dialysis systolic blood pressure, also between IL-1 and Et-1. From the previous results, it could be concluded that the vascular endothelial factors studied (NO and Et-1) together with the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF-α contribute to the development of HD-induced hypotension in ESRF subjects which is evidenced by: (1) the coupling of decrease of blood pressure and increase in NO2 plus NO3 level after HD in group I; (2) Et-1, which is a powerful vasoconstrictor, showed a significant decrease postdialysis; and (3) levels of cytokines (IL-1 and TNF-α) (which are potent NO inducers) were found to be significantly increased postdialysis in group I.

AB  - Hyperphosphatemia and poor uremia control are established cardiovascular risk factors in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) associated with impaired endothelial dependent and independent vasodilation (EDV and EIV). Nocturnal hemodialysis [6???8?h/week] augments dialysis dose and offers normal phosphate (Pi) balance. We hypothesized that NHD would restore EDV (endothelial function) and EIV (vascular smooth muscle cell function) by simultaneously improving uremia and Pi control. 2 groups of ESRD patients (mean age 41?±?2 years) stratified according to their baseline plasma Pi levels (normal Pi <1.8?mM, high Pi >1.8?mM) were studied. Dialysis dose (Kt/V per session), plasma Pi, blood pressure (BP) and brachial artery responses to reactive hyperemia (EDV), and sublingual nitroglycerin (EIV) were examined before, 1 and 2 months after conversion from conventional hemodialysis (CHD) [3???4?h/week] to NHD. After 2 months, NHD increased dialysis dose (from 1.24?±?0.06 to 2.04?±?0.08; p?=?0.02) and lowered BP (from 140?±?5/82?±?3 to 119?±?1/71?±?3, p?=?0.01) in all patients. In patients with adequate Pi control during CHD, EDV was normalized after 1 month of NHD. In contrast, in the high Pi group, 1 month of NHD was sufficient to reduce plasma phosphate levels, but 2 months of NHD was required for EDV to improve. Variables Normal Pi (n=10) CHD NHD (1month) NHD (2months) High Pi (n=8) CHD NHD (1month) NHD (2 months) Pi (mM) ?1.44?±?0.09 1.08?±?0.07* 1.14?±?0.11* 2.52?±?0.3 1.40?±?0.17* 1.26?±?0.05* EDV (%) ?3.4?±?2.7 7.5?±?1.9* 7.6?±?1.3* ?1.7?±?1.3 0.37?±?1.6? ?8.8?±?1.2* EIV (%) ?8.2?±?4.8 10.3?±?2.0 15.1?±?2.0* 5.1?±?1.1 ?6.6?±?0.8? 16.9?±?1.7* * p?<?0.05 from values during CHD. ? p?<?0.05 between the normal and high Pi groups. Correction of uremia without normalization of plasma Pi is insufficient to improve EDV. The time course over which this improvement in vascular responsiveness occurs is delayed in hyperphosphatemic patients, suggesting that improvement in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell function requires restoration of normal intracellular Pi balance.

AB  - There is a growing interest in the use of daily dialysis since long-term experiences have shown good results. Online hemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) is an HDF technique that combines diffusion with high convection in which the ultrapure dialysis fluid itself is used as a reinfusion solution. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the beneficial effect of the more effective dialysis schedule (daily dialysis) with the dialysis modality that offers the highest uremic toxin removal (OL-HDF). Five children with left ventricular hypertrophy, mean age 12.3?±?6.2 years, on standard 3??4?h 3 times a week OL-HDF at least during the last 6 months, were switched to D-OL-HDF, 3??4?h 6 times per week with a minimal follow up of 6 months. Dialysis parameters were similar during both periods and only frequency of each session was changed. Tolerance, anemia control, phosphatemia, and phosphate binders, need of blood pressure medications, and left ventricular hypertrophy were evaluated. Only 3 of the 5 enrolled children could be followed 12 months, 1 was transplanted after 3 months, the other after 5 months D-OL-HDF. For all the children the disappearance of postdialysis fatigue was rapidly reported. There was a significant decrease in predialysis levels of phosphatemia (from 1.67±0.23 to 1.28±0.29?mmol/L) despite phosphate binders reduction of more than 50%. Hemoglobin significantly increased (from 11.8±0.9 to 13.4±1.3?g percentage ml) allowing EPO doses reduction. Left ventricular hypertrophy disappeared after 6 months D-OL-HDF, fractional shortening increased, allowing registration on transplantation list for 1 child. Our results clearly demonstrate that daily online HDF is able to offer to children on chronic dialysis a marked reduction of the cardiovascular risk factors. Is it ethical to reserve this dialysis modality only to selected children?

AB  - Vascular access thrombosis is a frequent complication in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Genetic mutations, inflammation, and changes in the vascular wall are some factors that are thought to increase thrombosis risk. In this study, we tested for possible relationships between vascular thrombosis and some known thrombophilic mutation/polymorphisms in coagulation factors [factor V Leiden (FVL), prothrombin (Pt) G20210A, methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR C677T), factor XIII (F-XIII) Val34Leu, alpha-fibrinogen (AF) Thr312Ala, factor VII (F-VII) R353Q] and angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) gene in our HD patients. Patients who had experienced at least 3 episodes of AVF thrombosis composed of the study group, and patients who had never encountered this complication composed of the control group. None of the patients in either group had a history of diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, dialysis-related amyloidosis, or vasculitis. In order to find the frequency of F-XIII Val34Leu, AF Thr312Ala, and F-VII R353Q polymorphisms in our population, we also searched persons without renal disease or history of thrombosis (normal group). Results are summarized in Table. There was a tendency toward thrombotic mutation/polymorphisms in the study group for FVL, Pt G20210A, ACE I/D, and AF Thr312Ala. We suggest that patients who develop recurrent AVF thrombosis should be screened for the above-mentioned factors and investigated for other possible risk factors. This screening would allow more effective focus on prophylaxis.

AB  - Cardiovascular complications affect diabetic subjects early and the more susceptible ones are those on hemodialysis. Objective:? This study was designed to observe prevalent cardiac involvement in both pre- and already on dialysis diabetics. Method:? Sixty diabetics, 30 predialysis (predialysis diabetics, group 1), and 30 on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD, group 2) were randomly selected and their different clinical, biochemical, and echocardiographic parameters were compared. Result:? Both groups of patients were matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Features like systolic and diastolic blood pressure were lower in predialysis diabetics group than in MHD group [138?±?19 vs. 152?±?32, p?<?0.02 and 74?±?10 vs. 87?±?10?mmHg (p?<?0.001)]; hemoglobin higher [10.3?±?2.1 vs. 7.5?±?1.5 g/dL (p?<?0.001)]; serum creatinine was lower [3.49?±?1.8 vs. 9.5?±?2.5 mg/dL (p?<?0.001)] (due to recruitment criteria); left ventricular muscle mass index (LVMI) also lower [137?±?96 vs. 211?±?77?g/m2 (p?<?0.001)]; left ventricular end diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) less [58?±?21 vs. 85?±?25 mL/m2 (p?<?0.001) and fractional shortening (FS, %) higher [33?±?4.3 vs. 28?±?5.8 (p?<?0.006)]. Only 11% of Pre subjects had LV hypertrophy (LVMI >131?g/m2 in male and in female LVMI >110?g/m2) whereas it was 51% in MHD (p?<?0.001). Systolic dysfunction (FS?=?<25%) was 4% in Pre subjects and 24% in MHD (p?<?0.03) group. Correlation study showed systolic and diastolic blood pressure; both had positive correlation with LVMI (r?=?0.38, p?<?0.008 and r?=?0.32, p?<?0.02) and LVEDVI (r?=?0.36, p?<?0.01 and r?=?0.35, p?<?0.01) and also similarly positive with serum creatinine (r?=?0.35, p?<?0.02 and r?=?0.5, p?<?0.001). Conclusion:? It may be concluded that cardiac parameters are grossly altered in majority of diabetics on dialysis and higher serum creatinine and uncontrolled blood pressure may be responsible for this.

AB  - Poorly functioning dialysis access, whether graft or AV fistula, is a contributor to decreased efficiency of dialysis. Thrombosis results in the need for surgery and increases patient suffering. Objectives:? To determine whether an advanced glycation end product (AGE), pentosidine, might serve as a marker of disease activity and thrombosis of dialysis access. These results were obtained during the blinded phase of a study to evaluate the efficacy of the antioxidant vitamin E in preventing vascular access thrombotic events. Methods:? Twenty-six patients had blood drawn and access flow evaluated initially and at intervals for up to 1.5 years. In the study design, participants received either 800?IU vitamin E daily by mouth or identical placebo capsules. Blood plasma was examined to determine pentosidine content at baseline and every 3?m. Patients with an access flow of <800?mL/min were referred to a surgeon for evaluation. Access flow was evaluated by using the transonic flow meter and the saline release method. When sequential double dialyzers were used, saline injection method was applied post dialyzers, but before the venous drip chamber. Results:? Mean initial level of pentosidine before the administration of vitamin E was 20.22?pmol/mg (range 5.04?59.62?pmol/mg). During the study period, 5 patients had procedures related to thrombosis performed on their accesses. Blood drawn before the thrombotic event showed an increase above baseline of 6.87?±?15.47 (range ?5.9 to +33.7?pmol/mg). Patients without events showed a mean decrease of 9.7?± 12.24?pmol/mg pentosidine (p?<?0.02). Conclusion:? An increase in levels of pentosidine was associated with clotting of hemodialysis access. This change may reflect the effects of oxidative stress and/or thrombus formation. As these data are gathered from an ongoing double-blinded study, the effect of vitamin E on thrombus formation and pentosidine levels has not yet been ascertained.
