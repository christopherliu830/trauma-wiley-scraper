AB  - Objective:? The aim of this study was to observe the anticoagulant effect of the new type of citrate anticoagulant hemodialysate in renal failure patients at high risk of bleeding. Methods:?57 patients at high risk of bleeding were given hemodialysis for 4 hours and were divided into 3 groups according to hemodialysis procedures: Group 1 was saline-flush hemodialysed with bicarbonate hemodialysate. Group 2 was hemodialysed with citrate hemodialysate and with no anticoagulant. Group 3 was hemodialysed with bicarbonate hemodialysate and with nadroparin calcium (a low molecular weight heparin, LMWH) as anticoagulant. Bleeding complication, coagulation of extracorporeal circuit, venous blood pressure, heart rate, QTC, activated coagulation time (ACT), ionized-calcium (iCa++), total calcium and pH, , Na+, K+, Cl?, BUN, Cr, GPT, GST, TBIL, DBIL, as well as the blood cell counts were monitored during hemodialysis, and a scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis was used to investigate the morphology of thrombus formation and cellular aggregation on the interior surface of hemodialysis membranes. Results:?During the hemodialysis in Group 1, venous blood pressure increased continuously, resulting in the failure of hemodialysis for 4 out of 19 patients. Hemodialysis for 4 hours in Group 2 were all successfully fulfilled. No bleeding episodes occurred. No severe clotting of dialyzers and blood accesses was observed. ACT was extended and iCa++ decreased obviously in the venous line, but ACT and iCa++ in vivo were normal. pH, tended to increase but not to metabolic alkalosis levels. Na+, K+, Cl?, GPT, GST, TBIL, DBIL, as well as the counts of blood cells were all within the normal range. There was no severe thrombus observed by SEM in the hollow fibers. In Group 3, severe bleeding complication happened to 3 out of 19 patients, and one of them died. ACT was extended obviously at the arterial end. Conclusions:?The citrate anticoagulant hemodialysate was proved to be practical, safe and effective. So it is indicated for patients with an active or recently active bleeding focus.

AB  - The most common complication of tunneled-cuffed hemodialysis catheters is catheter-related bacteremia (CRB), which contributes to patient morbidity and loss of vascular access. Gram positive microorganisms are the most common etiologic agents; coagulase negative staphylococcus and corynebacterium species are the two most prevalent strains in our center. These are the common inhabitants of skin flora, suggesting that infection of catheters occur through the exit site. The Biopatch is a chlorhexidine impregnated dressing designed to keep the exit site from colonization with skin flora. This may decrease the incidence of CRB due to organisms from the skin. Objective:?To investigate whether the application of the biopatch at the exit site has any effect on the incidence and the etiology of CRB. Methods:?Chart review of 63 pediatric chronic hemodialysis patients who were dialysed between January 1999 and December 2003 was performed. The mean age at start of hemodialysis was 13.9?±?4.6 years. The pre-Biopatch era started in January 1999 till the end of June 2001, and the Biopatch era started in July 2001 to December 2003. Biopatch was applied at the beginning of every dialysis week after Betadine cleansing of the exit site, which was then covered with a transparent dressing. In the pre-Biopatch era, the exit site was cleansed with Betadine at every dialysis session and then covered with a transparent dressing. Results:?The use of the Biopatch at the exit site caused a significant decrease in the exit site infections. However, contrary to what was expected, there was no decrease in the incidence of CRB. Pre-Biopatch Era Biopatch Era p value Gram positive infections % 76% 76% NS Gram negative infections % 10% 14% NS Polymicrobial infections % 14% 10% NS Total number of infections 108 (19 patients) 143 (29 patients) NS Exit site infections-number 20 (9 patients) 5 (3 patients) p?<?0.05 Conclusion:? The use of the Biopatch decreases exit site infections. However, it fails to decrease the incidence of CRB. It has no effect on the etiologic agent of the bacterial infection.

AB  - When you are working with home HD education you often meet patients who are very afraid of the moment when they are going to puncture the fistula themselves. Our experience is that the patient sometimes can?t concentrate on anything but this moment. For this reason we let the patient try to puncture as soon as possible. We also get many questions from colleges, doctors, and nurses on how to do it. Most of the patients are very successful and prefer to puncture themselves after having tried it. They say that it is less painful if you puncture yourself and we also have a feeling that it is very rare that they are unsuccessful. To get proof for these feelings we made a small inquiry among our patients, asking about how it is to puncture yourself. We sent the inquiry to 30 patients. We also decided to make a film showing how to puncture yourself. We asked some of our home HD patients if they wanted to contribute. The result of this is a video, which is 9?min long, showing how to puncture in different types of fistulas, underarm, overarm, and grafts.

AB  - Introduction:? Vascular access failure is one of the greatest sources of morbidity for chronic hemodialysis patients. Prophylactic and repeated measurement of access flow may be of importance in preventing clotting. The aim of the study was therefore to analyse the cost effectiveness of a shunt surveillance program, which reduces the appearance of occlusion of the vascular access. Methods: The number of vascular access interventions (surgery and radiology) in the period 2001 till 2003 (transonic measurement period, TMP; 63 patients) was compared with a reference period (RP, 1996 till 1998) during which no access flow was measured (58 patients). All measurements were done with Transonic? and interventions according to K/DOQI. Results:?During the RP, 123 vascular access operations (0.71 per patient year) were performed because of occlusion, whereas in the TMP 58 vascular access operations (0.3 per patient year) were performed. During the TMP, 298 angiographic measurements were performed (1.6 per patient year) in the RP 177, (1.0 per patient year). In the TMP, 1652 access flow measurements were performed. In order to prevent one shunt occlusion, 21 access flow measurements had to be performed. Total costs in the TMP (summary of angiography, angiography and PTA, hospitalization days, and operation costs) are reduced with 31% compared to the RP; costs per patient year in RP: ?2315. Costs per patient year in TMP: ?1606. Conclusion:?By means of a shunt surveillance program (based on access flow measurement), if necessary followed by angiography, it is possible to reduce the number of acute vascular access occlusions. Although a shunt surveillance program may take up a lot of time for the nursing staff, the beneficial effects, lower costs, and reduced morbidity for the patients outweigh this effort.

AB  - Purpose:? The use of tunneled, cuffed central venous catheters for hemodialysis is associated with poor flow, thrombosis, and infections due to the transcutaneous nature of these devices. A new design for a sutureless, tunneled cuffed catheter was evaluated in hemodialysis patients to determine the effect of its design on the incidence of exit site infection. Methods:?A polyurethane conduit with a uniquely designed cuff and subcutaneous skirt covered with Dacron velour was attached to standard double lumen central venous catheters. Seven (7) Ash catheters and one (1) Tesio catheter were fitted with the overtube and skirt and implanted in eight (8) patients undergoing routine hemodialysis. Patients were monitored for exit site infection, tunnel infection, bacteremia, cuff extrusion, and serosanguineous exudate. Results:?Catheters were implanted for 6 to 26 weeks. All catheters remained patent and no cases of bacteremia were observed. There was no evidence of exit site or tunnel infection, and no reported serosanguineous exudate from the exit site. Exit site care consisted of soap and water cleansing by the patient. Patients were able to shower or bathe 4 weeks post-implant. Conclusions:?The new design for a subcutaneous cuff and skirt appears to inhibit exit site infection and other common complications of central venous catheters.

AB  - Objective:? To observe the factors that affect the citrate concentration in hollow fiber when using citrate hemodialysate. Methods:?By modeling hemodialysis in vitro, we studied 6 types of hemodialyzers at different blood flow rates, different dialysate flow-rate, and different fluids in vitro to detect the citrate concentration in hollow fiber. Results:?The citrate concentrations in different hemodialyzers were F60?>?FB-130UGA?>?GA-HP130?>?F6?>?FB-130AGA?>?WS-70 in turn. The concentrations at different blood flow-rates were different 100?mL/min?>?200?mL/min. Conclusions:?The concentration of citrate in hollow fiber is affected by different types of hemodialyzers and different blood as well as dialysate flow-rates. To achieve anticoagulation when using citrate hemodialysate, we must select suitable hemodialyzer such as FB-130UGA.

AB  - Abstract Background The purpose of this study was to characterize hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated differences in the expression of 47 inflammatory factors and to evaluate the potential role of peripheral immune activation in HCV-associated neuropsychiatric symptoms?depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain. An additional objective was to evaluate the role of immune factor dysregulation in the expression of specific neuropsychiatric symptoms to identify biomarkers that may be relevant to the treatment of these neuropsychiatric symptoms in adults with or without HCV. Methods Blood samples and neuropsychiatric symptom severity scales were collected from HCV-infected adults (HCV+, n = 39) and demographically similar noninfected controls (HCV?, n = 40). Multi-analyte profile analysis was used to evaluate plasma biomarkers. Results Compared with HCV? controls, HCV+ adults reported significantly (P < 0.050) greater depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain, and they were more likely to present with an increased inflammatory profile as indicated by significantly higher plasma levels of 40% (19/47) of the factors assessed (21%, after correcting for multiple comparisons). Within the HCV+ group, but not within the HCV? group, an increased inflammatory profile (indicated by the number of immune factors > the LDC) significantly correlated with depression, anxiety, and pain. Within the total sample, neuropsychiatric symptom severity was significantly predicted by protein signatures consisting of 4?10 plasma immune factors; protein signatures significantly accounted for 19?40% of the variance in depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain. Conclusions Overall, the results demonstrate that altered expression of a network of plasma immune factors contributes to neuropsychiatric symptom severity. These findings offer new biomarkers to potentially facilitate pharmacotherapeutic development and to increase our understanding of the molecular pathways associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in adults with or without HCV.

AB  - Abstract Background and objectives The aim of this study was to assess cellular and peritoneal immune responses after radical laparoscopic surgery in gastric cancer. Methods Peripheral heparinized plasma and plain serum tube samples were collected preoperatively, and at 2 hr, 1 day, and 4 days postoperatively for analysis o; white blood cells, total lymphocytes, T-helper lymphocytes, T-suppressor lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, plasma C-reactive protein and serum amyloid-A. Twenty-four hours peritoneal fluid collection was performed on days 1 and 4 for TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 analysis. Results No statistical differences were observed between the two groups with respect to immunocompetent cell counts. The serum levels of plasma CRP and SAA gradually increased significantly with time in both groups, but these temporal increases were lower in the LADG group (CRP; P?=?0.03, SAA; P?=?0.01). Peritoneal TNF-α levels in the CODG group at 4 days postoperatively were significantly higher than at day 1, but remained almost unchanged in the LADG group, and this difference was significant (P?=?0.02). Conclusion Because of its association with reduced peritoneal immune activity, laparoscopic surgery for advanced gastric cancer may require careful consideration in practice. Additional, larger prospective multicenter trials are required before a consensus can be reached. J. Surg. Oncol. 2008;98:54?59. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract We investigated the relationship between serum cystatin C levels and the prognosis of diabetic foot ulcerations (DFU). A population-based cohort study involving 1018 patients with type 2 diabetes was conducted. These patients recruited and divided into two groups: nondiabetic foot ulcer group (NDF, n?=?865, 85.5%) and diabetic foot ulcer group (DFU, n?=?147, 14.5%).After a 1-year-follow-up, DFUs were grouped into healing (n?=?110, 74.8%) and nonhealing (n?=?37, 25.2%) group based on the clinical prognosis. Compared with the healing group, the nonhealing group were older, had long diabetic duration and had significantly increased serum cystatin C concentrations in DFU (p?<?0.01). After adjustments for age, diabetes duration, renal function and infection control, multiple logistical regression analysis revealed that cystatin C remained associated increased risk of undesirable DFU outcome (OR?=?7.279, 95% CI: 1.299?40.784, p?<?0.05). When divided into quartiles according to cystatin C levels, the healing rate of Quartile 4 was significantly lower (57.9%) compared with other groups (p?<?0.01). The odd is ratio (OR) analysis showed that the risk of undesirable DFU outcome in Quartile 4 was significantly higher (OR?=?4.554, 95% CI: 3.14?5.12, p?<?0.05) compared with that in Quartile 1. We concluded that there was a strong and independent association between serum cystatin C and diabetic foot ulceration prognosis, cystatin C?>?1.35 mg/L predicts more than sixfold increased risk of incurable foot ulceration.

AB  - More frequent dialysis is thought to be associated with increased heparin requirements; however, limited data are available which compare heparin requirements of conventional to daily dialysis. Objectives:? To determine differences in heparin dose during conventional thrice-weekly dialysis (CHD) compared to daily hemodialysis (DHD). Methods:? All patients within the daily home hemodialysis at the Northwest Kidney Centers were evaluated for heparin dose both pre- and post initiation of daily hemodialysis. Patients on DHD received an initial bolus of heparin, without a continuous heparin drip, and supplemental heparin midway through the dialysis run as needed to maintain adequate activated clotting times (ACTs). CHD patients received a heparin bolus, followed by initiation of heparin drip as needed to maintain adequate ACTs. Results:? Of the 1117 patients who dialyze at the NKC, 55% were Caucasian, 21% African-American, 20% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 35% were of other ethnicity. The majority of patients were greater than 60 years (56%), while 36% ranged from 40?60 years and 13% ranged from 20?40 years. Male patients constituted 54% of patients. Diabetes was the primary cause of renal disease (36%), followed by hypertension (21%) and glomerular disease (18%). Of those patients in the home hemodialysis program (n?=?45), 10 patients started daily home hemodialysis using the Aksys daily home hemodialysis system. Of those, the majority was male (100%), Caucasian (78.8%) with an average age of 46.7?±?18 years. Glomerulonephritis was the primary cause of end-stage renal disease (40%), while the percentages of other diseases were similar [Alport's syndrome (20%), hypertension (20%) and diabetes (10%)]. Compared to initial DHD heparin requirements (10,111?±?2219 units), CHD heparin dose requirements (6833?±?2715 units) were significantly lower (p?=?0.045); however, total heparin needs were similar between groups (10,166?±?4380 units vs. 10,778?±?2959 units) (p?=?0.324). Conclusion:? Although patients initiating DHD have greater initial heparin requirements than when on CHD, total heparin doses remain similar to those required on conventional thrice-weekly hemodialysis. Greater initial heparin doses required during short daily dialysis appear safe compared to those of conventional dialysis.

AB  - Background:? The purpose of this study was to evaluate the amount of neo-intimal tissue in-growth present at the arterial and venous sides of the anastomosis and the degree of endothelial cell lining of the graft lumen in sheep using commercial vascular grafts coated with the P15 cell-binding peptide. Methods:? ePTFE vascular grafts were coated with the cell-binding P15 peptide using a newly developed plasma surface treatment method. 4 P15-treated grafts and 2 control grafts were implanted as arterio-venous fistulas between the femoral artery and vein and between the carotid artery and jugular vein in 2 sheep. 1 animal was euthanized after 14 days and the other animal after 28 days. The grafts along with the connecting arteries and veins were explanted and evaluated for the length of tissue in-growth along the luminal surface of the ePTFE graft from the anastomosis at the arterial and venous sides. Intimal thickness was carefully measured. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) was used to confirm the endothelial cell lining. Results:? The study showed a significant difference (p?<?0.05) in intimal thickness between the coated and uncoated grafts in the venous side of the anastomosis. The average intimal thickness of coated samples (551??m) was 3 times thinner than that of uncoated ones (1657??m). The endothelial cell lining appeared to be thicker, and its coverage was more uniform for the peptide-coated grafts than the uncoated ones. Overall, there was more neo-intimal tissue in-growth at the venous side than the arterial side of the anastomosis. The intima at the venous side was also thicker and more bulky compared to the arterial side. Conclusion:? This study has demonstrated that P15-coated ePTFE grafts had less intimal tissue in-growth developed at the venous side of the anastomosis than the uncoated ePTFE grafts. The degree of endothelial cell lining for coated samples was also higher than uncoated ones, which is consistent with our in vitro studies using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. P15-coated ePTFE graft materials had significantly improved cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration in vitro over uncoated ePTFE.
