AB  - The use of fresh platelets has gained value in medicine as an essential part of wound treatments. This is not surprising since platelets contain a number of bioactive factors that contribute to the process of wound healing, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF). Fresh platelets? short shelf life limits platelet-based therapies. If platelets can be stabilized in freeze-dried form (FDP) then long-term storage as well as pathogen inactivation methods become possible. Adlyfe and Oregon Freeze-Dry have been developing technology to stabilize freeze-dried human platelets that can be subjected to gamma irradiation and stored for a long duration. Upon reconstitution, irradiated FDP retained growth factors PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, and TGF-B1 in quantities similar to fresh platelets as judged by capture ELISA. The rehydrated FDP promoted new DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation of primary human dermal fibroblasts and endothelial cells (HUVECs) similar to fresh platelets. The FDP also promoted remodeling of extracellular matrix by accelerating fibroblast-mediated contraction of collagen gels and stimulated HUVECs to undergo angiogenesis and form capillary structures in vitro. Therefore, we conclude that FDP and fresh platelets have comparable in vitro wound healing potential. Preclinical wound healing stud'ies in diabetic mice are under way and further development will allow FDP to be a safe and well-suited alternative to fresh platelets for wound healing applications.

AB  - Understanding the potentially adverse effects of exposure to domestic violence on children is increasing in the Western world. However, in Australian family law, there remain challenges in centralising the special needs of these children in cases before the family courts in the determination of their best interests. This article draws on some key findings of a small qualitative study to highlight and discuss some of the barriers that need to be overcome in order for social science experts to enhance the courts' capacity to protect child subjects of proceedings from possible future harm.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Aggressive i.v. hydration with crystalloids is the first step in managing acute pancreatitis (AP) and is associated with improved survival. Guidelines about the choice of crystalloids to use are unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis was aimed to discern whether the choice of fluids in managing pancreatitis was associated with patients' outcomes. METHODS A comprehensive literature review was conducted by searching the Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed and Google Scholar databases to December 2017 to identify all studies that compared normal saline (NS) with Ringer's lactate (RL) for managing AP. The characteristics of the participants, outcome measurements (including mortality, the development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome [SIRS] on admission and at 24?h, and pancreatic necrosis) were analyzed. RESULTS Five studies (three randomized controlled trials and two retrospective cohort studies) with 428 patients were included in this analysis. Mortality trended lower in the RL group but this was not statistically significant (pooled odds ratio [OR] 0.61, 95% CI 0.28?1.29, P?=?0.20). Patients in the RL group had significantly decreased odds of developing SIRS at 24?h (pooled OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15?0.98, P?=?0.05). CONCLUSIONS RL has anti-inflammatory effects and is associated with decreased odds of persistent SIRS at 24?h, which is a marker of severe disease in AP patients. Although mortality trended lower in the RL group this did not achieve statistical significance and hence larger randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate this association.

AB  - Abstract: Scedosporium species are increasingly isolated from immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. Scedosporium infections are generally resistant to multiple antifungals, and Scedosporium prolificans is particularly resistant to all single antifungal agents currently in use with in vitro testing. We report here a long-term renal transplant recipient who developed isolated S. prolificans septic monoarthritis and probable osteomyelitis. The infection was successfully treated with a combination of voriconazole and terbinafine in addition to joint washout but did not require radical surgery. This combination has been shown to have synergistic in vitro effect, and anecdotal in vivo success has also been reported recently. We also review the clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of S. prolificans infection in patients with solid organ transplantation.
