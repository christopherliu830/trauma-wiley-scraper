AB  - Summary Sepsis, also known as septicemia, is one of the 10 leading causes of death worldwide. The rising tide of sepsis due to bacterial, fungal and viral infections cannot be stemmed by current antimicrobial therapies and supportive measures. New paradigms for the mechanism and resolution of sepsis and consequences for sepsis survivors are emerging. Consistent with Benjamin Franklin's dictum ?an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure?, sepsis can be prevented by vaccinations against pneumococci and meningococci. Recently, the NIH NHLBI Panel redefined sepsis as ?severe endothelial dysfunction syndrome in response to intravascular and extravascular infections causing reversible or irreversible injury to the microcirculation responsible for multiple organ failure?. Microvascular endothelial injury underlies sepsis-associated hypotension, edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute kidney injury. Microbial genome products trigger ?genome wars? in sepsis that reprogram the human genome and culminate in a ?genomic storm? in blood and vascular cells. Sepsis can be averted experimentally by endothelial cytoprotection through targeting nuclear signaling that mediates inflammation and deranged metabolism. Endothelial ?rheostats? (e.g. inhibitors of NF-?B, A20 protein, CRADD/RAIDD protein and microRNAs) regulate endothelial signaling. Physiologic ?extinguishers? (e.g. suppressor of cytokine signaling 3) can be replenished through intracellular protein therapy. Lipid mediators (e.g. resolvin D1) hasten sepsis resolution. As sepsis cases rose from 387 330 in 1996 to 1.1 million in 2011, and are estimated to reach 2 million by 2020 in the US, mortality due to sepsis approaches that of heart attacks and exceeds deaths from stroke. More preventive vaccines and therapeutic measures are urgently needed.

AB  - Abstract This paper reports on 80 patients using dual electrode, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) over a four-year period Implant status, stimulation mode, anode-cathode configuration (array), cathode position, paresthesia overlap, explantation rates, complications, Visual Analog Scores (VAS), and overall satisfaction were examined in patients implanted with dual 8 contact, staggered, percutaneous electrodes. All patients had undergone implantation for chronic axial and extremity pain [e.g., Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS), Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)]. Outcomes were evaluated in view of our previous reports in this same group at 24 and 30 months (1,2). Data was collected by a disinterested third party. At 48 months, 18 of the original 80 patients were lost to follow-up. Of the 62 patients contacted, 33 remained implanted and 29 (47%) had been explanted. After an average evaluation of 85 arrays (PainDoc, Advanced Neuromodulation Systems, Plano, Texas), 88% of patients reported using one or two ?best? arrays (bipolar or guarded tripolar) to maintain favorable paresthesia overlap (89%), VAS reduction (8.1 to 4.9), and overall patient satisfaction (63%). These arrays were most commonly positioned about the physiologic midline of the COL3?4 vertebral segments for upper extremity pain, and the T9?10 vertebral segments for low back and lower extremity pain. In contrast to our initial reports where essentially all patients preferred more than two arrays to maintain ?best? paresthesia overlap and outcome, only 12% of these same patients maintained this trend in this long-term follow-up study. The arrays most commonly selected long-term as the ?best? ones (88% of all electrodes) were narrow (adjacent contact) bipoles and guarded cathode tripoles (< 8 contacts). Thirty-five percent of patients with thoracic implants achieved paresthesia in the low back at 48 months. Explantation rates and overall patient satisfaction were significantly affected by painful radio frequency (RF) antenna coupling. This data supports the efficacy of dual electrodes in optimizing long-term SCS paresthesia overlap and complex pain outcomes.

AB  - Ilmakunnas M, Höckerstedt K, Mäkisalo H, Siitonen S, Repo H, Pesonen EJ. Hepatic IL-8 release during graft procurement is associated with impaired graft function after human liver transplantation.?Clin Transplant 2010: 24: 29?35. ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? In experimental models, brain death induces inflammatory cascades, leading to reduced graft survival. Thus far, factors prior to graft preservation have gained less attention in clinical setting. We studied pre-preservation inflammatory response and its effects on graft function in 30 brain dead liver donors and the respective recipients. Before donor graft perfusion, portal and hepatic venous blood samples were drawn for phagocyte adhesion molecule expression and plasma cytokine determinations. Donor intensive care unit stay correlated with donor C-reactive protein (R?=?0.472, p?=?0.013) and IL-6 (R?=?0.419, p?=?0.026) levels, and donor (R?=?0.478, p?=?0.016) and recipient gamma-glutamyl transferase (R?=?0.432, p?=?0.019) levels. During graft procurement, hepatic IL-8 release was observed in 17/30 donors. Grafts with hepatic IL-8 release exhibited subsequently higher alkaline phosphatase [319 (213?405) IU/L vs. 175 (149?208) IU/L, p?=?0.006] and bilirubin [101 (44?139) ?mol/L vs. 30 (23?72) ?mol/L, p?=?0.029] levels after transplantation. Our findings support the concept that inflammatory response in the brain dead organ donor contributes to the development of graft injury in human liver transplantation.
