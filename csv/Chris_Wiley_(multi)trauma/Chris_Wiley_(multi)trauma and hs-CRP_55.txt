AB  - Abstract Loss of muscle mass and insulin sensitivity are common phenotypic traits of immobilisation and increased inflammatory burden. The suppression of muscle protein synthesis is the primary driver of muscle mass loss in human immobilisation, and includes blunting of post-prandial increases in muscle protein synthesis. However, the mechanistic drivers of this suppression are unresolved. Immobilisation also induces limb insulin resistance in humans, which appears to be attributable to the reduction in muscle contraction per se. Again mechanistic insight is missing such that we do not know how muscle senses its ?inactivity status? or whether the proposed drivers of muscle insulin resistance are simply arising as a consequence of immobilisation. A heightened inflammatory state is associated with major and rapid changes in muscle protein turnover and mass, and dampened insulin-stimulated glucose disposal and oxidation in both rodents and humans. A limited amount of research has attempted to elucidate molecular regulators of muscle mass loss and insulin resistance during increased inflammatory burden, but rarely concurrently. Nevertheless, there is evidence that Akt (protein kinase B) signalling and FOXO transcription factors form part of a common signalling pathway in this scenario, such that molecular cross-talk between atrophy and insulin signalling during heightened inflammation is believed to be possible. To conclude, whilst muscle mass loss and insulin resistance are common end-points of immobilisation and increased inflammatory burden, a lack of understanding of the mechanisms responsible for these traits exists such that a substantial gap in understanding of the pathophysiology in humans endures.

AB  - Abstract Background: Critical illness in cirrhotic patients is associated with a poor prognosis and increased susceptibility to infections. Monocyte HLA-DR expression is decreased in cirrhotic patients, but its prognostic value has not been investigated prospectively. Methods: Thirty-eight critically ill patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis were included in this prospective study. On admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein), interleukin (IL)-10, interferon (IFN)-? serum levels, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-αex vivo stimulation (whole blood assay) and HLA-DR expression on monocytes (FACS analysis) were determined. Immune parameters were furthermore measured every third day until discharge from the ICU or death of the patients. Results: Intensive care unit mortality of the cirrhotic patients was 34.2%. During admission, TNF ex vivo, IFN-? and HLA-DR expression were lower in non-survivors (all P<0.05), while IL-10 levels were increased in non-survivors compared with survivors (P=0.001). However, individual values clearly overlapped between groups. Prospective analysis revealed that monocyte HLA-DR expression remained stable or increased in survivors, but decreased in non-survivors (P=0.002). A decrease in HLA-DR expression between admission and day 3 was strongly associated with decreased IFN-? levels and increased ICU mortality (hazard ratio 3.36, P=0.008), mostly owing to late sepsis. This association was independent of the sequential organ failure assessment and model for end-stage liver disease score. Conclusions: Here we establish the relative HLA-DR expression (admission/day 3) as a prognostic marker for ICU mortality in critically ill cirrhotic patients. These results may guide the evaluation of immune-modulating therapies in these patients.

AB  - Bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) are a promising cell resource of osteoprogenitor cells for bone tissue engineering. However, the diverse characteristics of osteoprogenitor cells within the bone marrow of individual subjects require varying treatments to stimulate osteogenic differentiation. Thus, an effective monitoring system is needed to identify the progression of osteogenesis. Magnetic resonance (MR) microscopy was used in the present study to monitor osteogenesis of tissue engineering (TE) constructs prepared by human bone MSCs seeded on scaffolds of gelatin sponges. The characteristics of MR images and parameters corresponded to osteogenic progression of TE constructs exposed to differentiation medium, significantly differing from control groups exposed to basic medium. Upon quantification, MR image and parameters correlated well to cell seeding densities and alkaline phosphatase activities of various TE constructs. In conclusion, MR can effectively detect the biochemical cascades of osteogenic differentiation of TE constructs and may be a promising, noninvasive monitoring system to provide three-dimensional information for bone tissue engineering.
