AB  - The Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) system has been characterized as the principal tissue level response to hypoxia. Posttranslational regulation of HIF-1alpha has been reported to act though a Hypoxia Responsive Element (HRE) promoter region on a range of hypoxia-induced genes. A plasmid was constructed consisting of a fivefold HRE repeat conjugated to a luciferase gene, used as a marker for HRE activation. Plasmid HRE-luciferase was then transfected into a well-established ischemic rabbit ear wound healing model. Ischemia was induced using a variety of published models for interruption of arterial inflow and compared with a nonischemic control. Central artery, caudal artery and rostrocaudal artery models were tested for induction of ischemia. Tissue specimens were harvested from the transfected areas and solubilized. Luminescence of each specimen was measured using a standard luminometer to quantify luciferase induction. To provide correlation on a regional level, tissue level oxygen tension was measured directly for each wound model. Profound and statistically significant differences were found in the induced luciferase production. Marked differences in the tissue hypoxia between the various ischemic wound healing models correlated in graded fashion with the ischemia induced on an anatomic basis. The least ischemic model showed no significant difference in hypoxia readings versus control. The intermediate model showed a significant fourfold greater ischemia signaling. The most ischemic model showed a highly significant 72-fold greater ischemic response compared to controls. The use of gene transfection is described as a sensitive and effective method for quantification of tissue hypoxia at a cellular level in ischemic wounds. Acknowledgments:? This study was funded by the Wound Healing Research Laboratory.

What are the expectations? Inflammation is a central element of atherogenesis. Innate pathways contribute to vascular inflammation. However, the initial molecular process(es) starting atherogenesis remain elusive. The various risk factors, represented by particular compounds (activators), may cause altered cellular functions in the endothelium (e.g. vascular endothelial cell activation or -dysfunction), in invading cells (e.g. inflammatory mediator production) or in local vessel wall cells (e.g. inflammatory mediators, migration), thereby triggering the innate inflammatory process. The cellular components of innate immunology include granulocytes, natural killer cells and monocytes. Among the molecular innate constituents are innate molecules, such as the toll-like receptors or innate cytokines. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6 are among the innate cytokines. Cytokines are potent activators of a great number of cellular functions relevant to maintain or commove homeostasis of the vessel wall. Within the vessel wall, vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) can significantly contribute to the cytokine-dependent inflammatory network by: (i) production of cytokines, (ii) response to cytokines and (iii) cytokine-mediated interaction with invading leucocytes. The cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 are involved in SMC-leucocyte interaction. The IL-6 effects are proposed to be mediated by trans-signalling. Dysregulated cellular functions resulting from dysregulated cytokine production may be the cause of cell accumulation, subsequent low-density lipoprotein accumulation and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). The deposition of ECM, increased accumulation of leucocytes and altered levels of inflammatory mediators may constitute an ?innate-immunovascular-memory? resulting in an ever-growing response to anew invasion. Thus, SMC-fostered inflammation, promoted by invading innate cells, may be a potent component for development and acceleration of atherosclerosis.

AB  - We have developed a human fetal digit model of response to tip amputation to simulate the clinical phenomenon of digit tip regrowth or regeneration in children. We reported previously that younger estimated gestational age (EGA) digits respond to tip amputation with several layers of cells covering the phalangeal anlage, compared to older digits where such coverage comprises fewer cell layers or is absent. The proximal cut end of excised digits does not demonstrate such a response. We report here that the transcription repressor MSX1 is expressed beneath the developing nailfield in younger human fetal digits (57 to 67 days EGA), as has been shown in the mouse, and that cells expressing MSX1 are found at the digit tip by 4 days postamputation. Further, expression of keratins K14 and K19 is found, suggesting reforming of an epithelium. These findings are consistent with the mouse model of digit tip regeneration where MSX1-expressing cells are hypothesized to migrate to the amputation site and reconstitute the missing tip, and with the general observation that a wound epidermis is required for either regeneration or wound healing. 57?d EGA digits; left, MSX1 expression, control; left center, MSX1 and center, K19 expression, day 4 posttip amputation; right center, MSX1 and right, K19 expression, day 7 postamputation

AB  - Background:? Apligraf, a bioengineered living skin construct, has been shown to accelerate the healing of venous leg and diabetic foot ulcerations. It appears to function as cell-based therapy (e.g., delivering growth factors), rather than as a true graft. Given this mechanism of action, its use could be expanded to areas in which traditional skin grafting is not routinely employed. Methods:? A 64-year-old wheel-chairbound Caucasian male presented to the wound clinic with a grade III left trochanteric pressure ulcer which had been present since 1976. He had been seen by numerous physicians and treated with debridement, topical antimicrobials, negative pressure therapy, growth factors, and a variety of dressings. We spent several months preparing the wound bed: maintaining adequate moisture balance, performing serial debridement, utilizing offloading surfaces and reducing the bacterial burden. His nutritional status was optimized. The wound bed developed a healthy granulating base but failed to close. Results:? A single unit of Apligraf was meshed at a 1:1.5 ratio and applied to the wound. It was fixed in place using a nonstick silicone dressing, foam, and a self-adhesive covering. The dressing was changed weekly in the wound clinic. The initial response was a decrease in wound depth followed by steady epithelialization. Complete closure occurred 17 weeks after grafting. The wound has not recurred. Conclusion:? This single case study suggests that bilayered cell therapy may have application in difficult wounds, such as pressure ulcerations. Further study into the efficacy of Apligraf in pressure ulcerations is ongoing.

AB  - Acute wounds caused by the severe and extensive infection such as alpha-hemolytic streptococci or MRSA may be life-threatening in immunocompromised hosts such as steroid users or those with venostasis in the lower legs. The principle of the treatment is the removal of the primary pathogens, however, difficulties of the lower leg reconstruction remain due to the tissue loss and the deficiency of the circulation system after extensive soft tissue debridement. For 10 immediately-developing extensive lower extremity cases, artificial skin substitutes composed of dried bilayer membranes of outer silicone membrane and inner porcine-tendon derived collagen layer (Pelnac?, Gunze Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) were immediately after extensive and meticulous debridement. While the skin substitute integrated into the wound bed for maximally 3 weeks, total 20 micrograms of the basic fibroblast growth factors (bFGF)(Trafermin?, Kaken Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) were applied by the 27-Gage syringe daily. The outer membranes were removed and thin partial thickness skin grafting (9?10/1,000 inches) was performed and wound healed uneventfully. The bFGF-treated skin texture was significantly softer compared to control by a durometer (Teclock?, GS-701N, Tokyo, Japan)(p?<?0.01), which was a measuring device elastic hard products such as rubbers and polymers. Reconstruction using the porcine-derived artificial skin substitute in the lower extremities after extensive debridement was safe, easy, and reproducible. The quality of the wounds with bFGF significantly improves the healed skin texture.

AB  - Induced organ regeneration is de novo synthesis of a physiological, or nearly physiological, organ at the same anatomical site as the organ that is being replaced. Regeneration of skin, peripheral nerves, and the conjunctiva have been accomplished using nothing more than biologically active scaffolds (regeneration templates) seeded with epithelial cells; devices for regeneration of the first two organs are in clinical use. Templates appear to function by blocking contraction well as by acting as temporary configurational guides for synthesis of new stroma that resembles that of the organ under replacement. The combined evidence supports a theory which predicts that selective blocking of the adult healing response uncovers part, at least, of the latent fetal response to injury and, in the presence of the appropriate scaffold, eventually leads to organ regeneration. An independent theory suggests that loss of regenerative potential, which is observed during the mammalian fetal-adult transition, is associated with simultaneous acquisition of individual immunocompetence.
