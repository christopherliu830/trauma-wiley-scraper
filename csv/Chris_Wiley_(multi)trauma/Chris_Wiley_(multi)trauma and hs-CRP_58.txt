AB  - Abstract Purpose Necrotizing soft tissue infection, also known as necrotizing fasciitis (NF), is a fast-spreading life-threatening infection that most commonly affects the lower limbs, groin, or abdomen. Periocular necrotizing fasciitis (PNF) is rare. Limited data exist on PNF immune cell subset; hence, this study aims to determine the representation of immune cell subsets in patients diagnosed with PNF using immunohistochemical stainings. Methods All patients diagnosed with PNF at Copenhagen University Hospital from 2008 to 2018 were included. Their electronic medical records and pathology reports were assessed, and available tissue specimens were reviewed and stained with monoclonal antibodies for CD1a+ Langerhans? cells, CD3+ T lymphocytes, CD15+ granulocytes, CD44+ lymphohematopoietic cells, CD68+ histiocytes, CD79α+ B lymphocytes, and FXIIIa+ dendritic macrophages and Langerhans? cells. The number of positive cells was counted, and an average score was calculated. The location of immune cells and bacteria was assessed. Results The specimens were characterized by acute inflammation and necrosis of the fascia, while striated muscle involvement was less frequent. Haemolytic group A streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus were identified and mainly located in the deep dermis and subcutis in close relation to the fascia. Only few areas harboured both bacteria and inflammatory cells. Granulocytes, histiocytes and CD44+ lymphohematopoietic cells were demonstrated to be abundant in all patients, while B and T lymphocytes, dendritic macrophages and Langerhans? cells were less frequent. Conclusion The immune cell subsets found in this study of PNF were consistent with those identified in the literature on NF in other anatomical locations. This study concludes that immune cells are abundant and exhibit a typical pattern in PNF.

AB  - The goal of this study was to specifically estimate the effectiveness of Becaplermin, which is recombinant human platelet derived growth factor (rhPDGF). This was the first FDA-approved growth factor therapy for the treatment of diabetic neuropathic foot ulcer (DNFU). The previously published pivotal trials have shown that those who used rhPDGF were about 35%(i.e., a relative risk (RR) of about 1.35) more likely to heal by the 20th week of care. In our study treatment effectiveness was estimated in a retrospective cohort study, controlling for treatment selection bias using propensity scores derived from logistic regression. The cohort that we studied were patients with a DNFU treated at a Curative Health Services-affiliated wound care center between 1998?2004. We noted 25,098 individuals with a DNFU and overall about 10% received rhPDGF. We were able to successfully create a propensity score model such that the distributions of patient age and gender, wound duration, wound area, wound grade, treating center, and wound location were evenly balanced between those who received rhPDGF and those who did not. The RR for a wound to heal after treatment with rhPDGF as compared to standard care after 20 weeks of care at a wound care center was 1.33 (1.28, 1.38). With respect to amputation, the RR for having an amputation after receiving rhPDGF was 0.86 (0.77, 0.97). In conclusion, rhPDGF is more effective than standard therapy in both helping a wound to heal and preventing amputation. The effectiveness of rhPDGF with respect to getting a wound to heal is similar ?in this real-world setting? as the efficacy estimates from the previously published randomized controlled trials.

AB  - Abstract Developmental environments influence individuals' long-term health trajectories, and there is increasing emphasis on understanding the biological pathways through which this occurs. Epigenetic aging evaluates DNA methylation at a suite of distinct CpG sites in the genome, and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) is linked to heightened chronic morbidity and mortality risks in adults. Consequently, EAA provides insights on trajectories of biological aging, which early life experiences may help shape. However, few studies have measured correlates of children's epigenetic aging, especially outside of the U.S. and Europe. In particular, little is known about how children's growth and development relate to EAA in ecologies in which energetic and pathogenic stressors are commonplace. We studied EAA from dried blood spots among Bondongo children (n = 54) residing in a small-scale, fisher-farmer society in a remote region of the Republic of the Congo. Here, infectious disease burdens and their resultant energy demands are high. Children who were heavier for height or taller for age, respectively, exhibited greater EAA, including intrinsic EAA, which is considered to measure EAA internal to cells. Furthermore, we found that children in families with more conflict between parents had greater intrinsic EAA. These results suggest that in contexts in which limited energy must be allocated to competing demands, more investment in growth may coincide with greater EAA, which parallels findings in European children who do not face similar energetic constraints. Our findings also indicate that associations between adverse family environments and greater intrinsic EAA were nonetheless observable but only after adjustment for covariates relevant to the energetically and immunologically demanding nature of the local ecology.

AB  - Individuals with psychiatric disorders have elevated rates of autoimmune comorbidity and altered immune signaling. It is unclear whether these altered immunological states have a shared genetic basis with those psychiatric disorders. The present study sought to use existing summary-level data from previous genome-wide association studies to determine if commonly varying single nucleotide polymorphisms are shared between psychiatric and immune-related phenotypes. We estimated heritability and examined pair-wise genetic correlations using the linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and heritability estimation from summary statistics methods. Using LDSC, we observed significant genetic correlations between immune-related disorders and several psychiatric disorders, including anorexia nervosa, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, smoking behavior, and Tourette syndrome. Loci significantly mediating genetic correlations were identified for schizophrenia when analytically paired with Crohn's disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and ulcerative colitis. We report significantly correlated loci and highlight those containing genome-wide associations and candidate genes for respective disorders. We also used the LDSC method to characterize genetic correlations among the immune-related phenotypes. We discuss our findings in the context of relevant genetic and epidemiological literature, as well as the limitations and caveats of the study.

AB  - Chronic nonhealing wounds have been long associated with an imbalance between the degrading metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs). Human and animal studies have shown psychological stress to impair healing and differentially regulate gene expression. We hypothesized that psychological stress-impaired healing is mediated by altered expression of MMP and TIMP. SKH-1 mice were subjected to restraint stress 3 days before and 5 days after placement of 3.5?mm biopsy wounds. The wounds were biopsied at various time points and analyzed for gene expression by real-time PCR. The wounds of stressed mice showed significantly delayed healing when compared to the wounds of controls through day 5 postwounding. There was a significantly higher expression of MMP-8 in the stressed groups on days 1 (172%, p?<?0.0003) and 3 (204%, p?<?0.0003) postwounding. Stress decreased MMP-9 expression on day 5 postwounding (56%, p?<?0.02), but showed no significant difference to controls on the other days. TIMP-1, which is known to inhibit most activated MMPs, had significantly lower expression on day 5 postwounding (56%, p?<?0.0003). TIMP-2, which is constitutively expressed, did not show any difference in expression between the stress and the control groups. During stress, increased MMP-8 (neutrophil collagenase) activity is in agreement with previous studies in our model that have demonstrated a increase in neutrophil recruitment on days 3 and 5 postwounding. Likewise, lower expression of TIMP-1 during stress is similar to findings in chronic wounds as opposed to healing surgical wounds. Hence, altered expression of the metalloproteinases and their inhibitors, may lead to increased damage early in healing and decreased repair later in stress-impaired wound healing.

AB  - Abstract The economic devastation caused in the past by the New World screwworm fly Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) to the livestock industry in the U.S.A., Mexico and the rest of Central America was staggering. The eradication of this major livestock pest from North and Central America using the sterile insect technique (SIT) as part of an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) programme was a phenomenal technical and managerial accomplishment with enormous economic implications. The area is maintained screwworm-free by the weekly release of 40?million sterile flies in the Darien Gap in Panama, which prevents migration from screwworm-infested areas in Columbia. However, the species is still a major pest in many areas of the Caribbean and South America and there is considerable interest in extending the eradication programme to these countries. Understanding New World screwworm fly populations in the Caribbean and South America, which represent a continuous threat to the screwworm-free areas of Central America and the U.S.A., is a prerequisite to any future eradication campaigns. The Old World screwworm fly Chrysomya bezziana Villeneuve (Diptera: Calliphoridae) has a very wide distribution ranging from Southern Africa to Papua New Guinea and, although its economic importance is assumed to be less than that of its New World counterpart, it is a serious pest in extensive livestock production and a constant threat to pest-free areas such as Australia. In the 1980s repeated introductions and an expansion of Old World screwworm populations were reported in the Middle East; in the 1990s it invaded Iraq and since late 2007 it has been reported in Yemen, where a severe outbreak of myiasis occurred in 2008. Small-scale field trials have shown the potential of integrating the SIT in the control of this pest and various international organizations are considering using the release of sterile insects as part of an AW-IPM approach on a much wider scale. Wohlfahrtia magnifica (Schiner) (Diptera: Sarcophagidae) is a screwworm of temperate regions, which, although of limited agricultural importance, has invaded several new locations in the past few years. This special issue reports on the results of a 6-year project funded by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/International Atomic Energy Agency (FAO/IAEA) Programme of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture entitled ?Enabling Technologies for the Expansion of the SIT for Old and New World Screwworm?. A major goal of the project was to better understand population genetic variation in screwworms as an aid to the identification of isolated populations. The project also addressed issues related to genetic sexing, cuticular hydrocarbons, population dynamics, genetic transformation and chromosome analysis.
