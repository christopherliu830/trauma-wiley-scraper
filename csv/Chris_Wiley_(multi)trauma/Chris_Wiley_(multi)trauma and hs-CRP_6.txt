AB  - Objectives Prevalence and risk factors of PTSD among injured garment workers who survived a major factory collapse. Methods Survivors receiving treatment or rehabilitation care at one year post event were surveyed, which included Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Specific version. Results The respondents consisted of 181 people with a mean age of 27.8 years and a majority had less than high school education (91.2%). Multivariable logistic regression found that the odds of having PTSD was higher among married (OR: 3.2 [95% CI: 1.3?8.0]), those who used to work more than 70?hr/week (OR: 2.4 [1.1?5.3]), workers who used to hold higher job positions (OR: 2.6 [1.2?5.6]) or who had a concussion injury (OR: 3.7 [1.4?9.8]). Among the respondents, 83.4% remained unemployed, and only 57.3% (63 people) reported receiving a quarter or less of what they were promised as compensation. Conclusions Probable PTSD was prevalent among surviving workers of the Rana Plaza building collapse in Bangladesh. Am. J. Ind. Med. 58:756?763, 2015. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Introduction:? Sickle cell ulcers are a frequent dermatologic manifestation of sickle cell disease. They are almost exclusively described in the legs near the malleoli and are often bilateral. Such ulcers in the upper extremities are not described. We report a case of sickle cell ulcer in hand presumably related to arterio-venous fistula in the forearm placed for hemodialysis in a patient with chronic kidney disease. Case:? A 45-year-old African-American man with a history of sickle cell disease, hypertension, and kidney failure treated with hemodialysis presented with a painful wound in his left hand near the base of his thumb, which had been present for 6 weeks prior to presentation. There was no history of trauma. 6 months prior to the development of the ulcer, the patient had an arterio-venous fistula placed in the affected hand. The ulcer did not improve with use of antibiotics. Venous ultrasound of the left upper extremity showed occlusion of the cephalic vein and enlargement of the basilic vein. Subsequently, biopsy of the ulcer showed vascular proliferation with thickening of the vessel and obliteration of the vascular lumen. The blood vessels were plugged with sickled red blood cells, characteristic of sickle cell disease. Histological features of the lesion were indicative of vaso-occlusive disease, suggesting sickle cell ulcer. Patient was treated with surgical débridement and skin grafting after hyperbaric oxygen therapy that only resulted in partial recovery of the lesion. Discussion:? The pathogenesis of sickle cell ulcer is presumed to be related to a vaso-occlusive process, leading to tissue necrosis resulting in skin ulcers. Ulcers can occur spontaneously or with local trauma. Low oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, impaired venous hemodynamics, and low hemoglobin are recognized contributing factors. The arterio-venous fistula causing diversion of arterial blood probably contributed to the development of sickle cell ulcer. Conclusion:? Sickle cell ulcers in the hand, although extremely rare, can occur in sickle cell patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis with arterio-venous fistula. This results from the altered local vascular hemodynamics that predispose to vaso-occlusive conditions, eventually leading to ulceration.

AB  - Red blood cell (RBC) survival in patients on chronic maintenance hemodialysis (HD) has been reported to be shortened due to the oxidative damage of RBC membrane. The use of antioxidants might help in the control of anemia and reduce the erythropoietin (EPO) dose needed. Objective:? The objective was to determine the effects of vitamin E-bonded dialyzer membrane (VEM) on anemia and EPO requirements in chronic HD patients. Patients and methods:? We prospectively studied 19 stable patients on HD (8 males, age 58.47, range 31?76 years) who were shifted from other dialyzer membranes to VEM for 6 months. At baseline they were given a mean dose of EPO of 90.6?±?51?U?kg?1 BW?1?week?1. Clinical data, dry body weight corrected pre-dialysis RBC, hemoglobin, reticulocytes, serum iron and ferritin, complete biochemistry, iPTH, and CRP were studied at 3 and 6 months, while therapy scheme was reevaluated monthly. Results:? A significant rise, compared to the baseline, was found in hemoglobin and in RBC at 3 months of treatment (12.44?±?1.16?g/dL vs. 11.2?±?1.2?g/dL, p?=?0.002; and 4.01?± 0.53???106/?L vs. 3.64?±?0.5???106/?L, p?<?0.05) and at the end of follow-up (12.17?±?1.33?g/dL vs. 11.2?±?1.2?g/dL, p?<?0.05; and 4.03?±?0.53 ??106/?L vs. 3.64?±?0.5???106/?L, p?<?0.05). No significant change in serum iron and ferritin, reticulocytes, EPO dose used, iPTH, Kt/V, or CRP was found at the end of follow-up compared to the baseline (68.8?±?17?mg/dL vs. 67.9 ±?18?mg/dL, p?=?NS; 421?±?296?mg/dL vs. 478?± 359?mg/dL, p?=?NS; 3.76?±?0.89???104/?L vs. 3.82?±?0.78 ??104/?L, p?=?NS; 90.2?±?53?U?kg?1?BW?1?week?1 vs. 90.6?±?51 U?kg?1?BW?1?week?1, p?=?NS; 157?±?43?pg/dL vs. 148?±?56?pg/dL, p?=?NS; 1.21?±?0.22 vs. 1.2?±?0.17, p?=?NS; 7.15?± 5.42?mg/L vs. 15.38?±?29.8?mg/L, p?=?NS, respectively). Conclusions:? Despite the small number of patients and the short time interval of treatment, an antioxidant effect of VEM apparently achieved early a better control of anemia in HD patients.

AB  - Abstract Background: Perioperative enteral immunonutrition is thought to reduce postoperative morbidity in patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery. This study assessed the clinical effects of preoperative enteral immunonutrition in well nourished patients with gastric cancer undergoing total gastrectomy. Methods: Well nourished patients with primary gastric cancer, fit for total gastrectomy, were randomized to either a control group with regular diet, or an immunonutrition group that received regular diet supplemented with 1000 ml/day of immunonutrients for 5 consecutive days before surgery. The primary endpoint was the incidence of surgical-site infection (SSI). Secondary endpoints were rates of infectious complications, overall postoperative morbidity and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels on 3?4 days after surgery. Results: Of 244 randomized patients, 117 were allocated to the control group and 127 received immunonutrition. SSIs occurred in 27 patients in the immunonutrition group and 23 patients in the control group (risk ratio (RR) 1·09, 95 per cent confidence interval 0·66 to 1·78). Infectious complications were observed in 30 patients in the immunonutrition group and 27 in the control group (RR 1·11, 0·59 to 2·08). The overall postoperative morbidity rate was 30·8 and 26·1 per cent respectively (RR 1·18, 0·78 to 1·78). The median CRP value was 11·8 mg/dl in the immunonutrition group and 9·2 mg/dl in the control group (P = 0·113). Conclusion: Five-day preoperative enteral immunonutrition failed to demonstrate any clear advantage in terms of early clinical outcomes or modification of the systemic acute-phase response in well nourished patients with gastric cancer undergoing elective total gastrectomy.

AB  - Introduction? Trauma teams and cardiac arrest teams provide an urgent and expert multi-disciplinary response to time critical emergencies. The present study documents the contribution of a medical emergency team (MET) to managing non-trauma surgical emergencies. Materials and Methods? Data was prospectively collected over a two year period concerning the contribution of medical emergency teams to the resuscitation of all patients with non-trauma surgical emergencies and altered vital signs in hospital wards. Results? Over the study period, the details of 19 patients with surgical emergencies were recorded. 63% of emergencies occurred outside of normal working hours. In 53% of cases, the surgical registrar was off-site or physically unavailable to attend the emergency immediately. In 11% of cases, the medical emergency team was activated prior to the arrival of the surgical registrar. In 26% of cases, the patient was left unattended whilst awaiting arrival of the surgical registrar. The medical emergency team provided resuscitation procedures and arranged urgent investigations in all patients, physically transported the patient to the operating theatre in 16% of patients and prepared for general anaesthetic in the operating theatre in 11% of cases. The surgical registrar complemented the medical emergency team response by liaising with consultant surgeons, anaesthetists and operating theatre staff in all cases. All patients received definitive treatment within 30 minutes of MET response. Conclusion? Routine use of medical emergency teams in the initial resuscitation of patients with surgical emergencies expedites definitive management.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to review the history, clinical course, treatment, and outcome of movement disorders in children and young people with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Case notes were reviewed retrospectively of children and young people who presented with movement disorders in CRPS to our tertiary paediatric pain service over a period of 13 years. Ten children with CRPS presented with movement disorders (eight females, two males). The age at first presentation with symptoms of CRPS ranged from 8 to 15 years (mean 11y 2mo, median 13y). The most common movement disorder was dystonia (n=8), followed by tremors (n=3) and myoclonus (n=3); two patients had all three movement disorders. The movement disorder affected mainly the lower limb (n=9) with a predilection for the foot (n=7) and was frequently initiated by minor trauma (n=7). Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 14 years. The outcome was variable, with good prognosis in nearly half of the cases: four children experienced complete resolution of symptoms. Two children showed a slight improvement. Four children showed no improvement. Movement disorders in CRPS are under-recognized in children. The management has to be multidisciplinary with an expertize in paediatric pain.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective.? Advanced complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) remains very difficult to treat. While subanesthetic low-dose ketamine has shown promise in early localized CRPS, its use in advanced CRPS has not been as effective. Since ketamine's analgesic potency and duration of effect in neuropathic pain are directly dose-dependant, we investigated the efficacy of ketamine in anesthetic dosage in refractory CRPS patients that had failed available standard therapies. Methods.? Twenty ASA I-III patients suffering from refractory CRPS received ketamine in anesthetic dosage over 5 days. Outcome criteria were pain relief, effect on the movement disorder, quality of life, and ability to work at baseline and up to 6 months following treatment. Results.? Significant pain relief was observed at 1, 3, and 6 months following treatment (93.5?±?11.1%, 89.4?±?17.0%, 79.3?±?25.3%; P?<?0.001). Complete remission from CRPS was observed at 1 month in all patients, at 3 months in 17, and at 6 months in 16 patients. If relapse occurred, significant pain relief was still attained at 3 and 6 months (59.0?±?14.7%, P?<?0.004; 50.2?±?10.6%, P?<?0.002). Quality of life, the associated movement disorder, and the ability to work significantly improved in the majority of patients at 3 and 6 months. Conclusions.? This open-label trial suggests benefit in pain reduction, associated CRPS symptoms, improved quality of life and ability to work following anesthetic ketamine in previously refractory CRPS patients. However, a randomized controlled trial will be necessary to prove its efficacy.

AB  - Objective:? Pleural involvement of salmonella infection is very rare and we are not aware of any case of salmonella empyema in hemodialysis patients. The purpose of this study is to report our experience of recurrent empyema due to Salmonella enteritidis with bacteremia in a patient on hemodialysis. Case report: A 53-year-old woman with end stage renal disease, having been on hemodialysis for 10 days, was brought to the emergency department due to fever and shortness of breath for 2 days. Her initial physical examination revealed diminished breathing sound over right lung field. The chest radiographs disclosed right pleural effusion and pleural fluid analysis included a white cell count of 13800(N/L:95/5), LDH 2534?U/L, protein 2.7?g/dL, and sugar 10?mg/dL. Right side empyema was noted. Sonography revealed splenomegaly. Salmonella enteritidis was identified from the cultures of blood and pleural fluid. After antimicrobial therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone for 2 weeks and pleural pigtail drainage, fever subsided and pleural drainage tube was removed. However, thoracoscopic debridement was done later because of recurrent empyema within one week after removing the drainage tube. Computed tomography revealed pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and splenomegaly, but there was no evidence of aortic aneurysm formation or infectious process of aorta. Overall the patient received 6 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone treatment and 3 months of oral ciprofloxacin. The follow-up CXR revealed minimal pleural effusion. Conclusion:? Nontyphoidal salmonella infection can present with empyema and bacteremia in patients on hemodialysis. Adequate drainage and antimicrobial therapy may be necessary to treat such patients effectively.

AB  - Purpose:? To report our initial experience of using cutting balloons angioplasty in the treatment of resistant venous stenoses of Brescia-Cimino fistulas. Materials and Methods:?Forty-eight patients with Brescia-Cimino fistulas underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of 62 venous stenoses. Of these 48 patients, we encountered 8 venous stenoses (8/62, 12.9%) in 7 patients that were not successfully dilated with 6?8?mm high-pressure balloons inflated up to 24 atm. In each of 8 stenoses, peripheral cutting balloons with diameters of 5?8?mm were employed to dilate resistant stenoses. Results:?The locations of stenoses were 3 at the surgical vein mobilization site (?swing point?), 4 at the cephalic vein downstream from the anastomosis, and 1 at the cephalic arch. The grade of stenosis after high-pressure balloon angioplasty ranged from 57% to 87%(mean, 76%). Cutting balloons expanded completely in all stenoses and the residual stenosis after cutting balloon PTA ranged from 0% to 24%(mean, 7%). Residual stenosis was virtually nonexisistent at the 3 stenoses of ?swing point.? A focal rupture with a large hematoma occurred at the cephalic arch stenosis, which was treated by a stent placement. One minimal rupture that did not require any treatment occurred at the stenosis of downstream cephalic vein. No repeat angioplasty has been needed during follow-up period (range, 74?249 days). Conclusion:?Our early experience demonstrated that when high-pressure balloons fail to dilate stenoses of Brescia-Cimino fistulas, peripheral cutting balloons with diameters of 5?8?mm can be effectively used to overcome the resistance of stenoses.

AB  - Background/Aims:? Procalcitonin (PCT) has been described as a new marker of severe infection and sepsis. In this study, we investigated the serum levels of PCT during the hemodialysis (HD) in chronically hemodialyzed patients and whether the PCT levels were correlated with other cytokines. Methods:? We measured pre- and post-HD PCT, interleukin (IL-1), IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) concentrations in 24 stable patients undergoing chronic HD [11 males and 13 females; age 41.2?±?18.0 years, 12?h/week, with a Kt/V of 1.41?±?0.35, polysynthane (PSN) membrane being used in all patients, without reuse]. Pre- and post-HD PCT concentrations were compared with cytokines such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and clinical parameters including age, blood pressure, leukocyte, hemoglobin levels, C-reactive protein (CRP), epoetin (EPO) doses, BUN, creatinine, parathormone (PTH), ferritin, and transferrin levels. Results:? Pre- and post-HD serum PCT levels were similar (0.77?±?0.40 and 0.83?±?0.61 ng/mL), and higher than upper normal level of 0.5?ng/mL. The levels of IL-2 and IL-10 decreased and the levels of IL-1 and TNF-α increased. Post-HD PCT correlated with PTH, IL-1, IL-2, and IL-10. Conclusion:? About 60% of patients had elevated PCT levels, HD with low-flux PSN membrane did not change serum PCT and IL-6. While IL-1 and TNF-α increased, IL-2 and IL-10 decreased by PSN membrane during HD. So that PCT levels can be measured just after HD as do prior to start of HD. Is there any relationship between PCT and PTH? PCT may be important in uremic bone disease.

AB  - Purpose:? To evaluate efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in non-maturing Brescia-Cimino fistulas. Methods:?Between January 1997 and December 2003, we treated 22 patients with non-maturing Brescia-Cimino fistulas by PTA. Retrospective analysis was performed on the findings of fistulogram, techniques and success rate of PTA, and patency rate. Results:?Seventeen segmental stenoses and 5 segmental occlusions of cephalic veins were identified. Sixteen stenoses and 2 occlusions were located at the cephalic vein adjacent to the anastomosis site, and 3 occlusions and 1 stenosis were seen at the proximal vein near the elbow joint. In addition to venous stenosis, a focal arterial stenosis at the anastomosis site and two accompanying accessory veins that might hamper maturation of main cephalic vein was seen in each of two patients, respectively. Simultaneous occlusion of left innominate vein as well as occlusion of cephalic vein were noted in one patient. Initial success rate of PTA was 95.5%(21/22). Overall success rate including 11 additional PTAs performed during follow-up was 96.9%(32/33). No major complication occurred. Primary and secondary patency rates were 72% and 95% at 3 months, and 50% and 77% at 6 months, respectively. Conclusion:?PTA is an effective and safe method in salvaging non-maturing Brescia-Cimino fistulas.
