AB  - Introduction:? Myofibroblasts are a subtype of fibroblasts, which appear temporally during wound healing. Young hypertrophic scar contains a large number of myofibroblasts and the number declines over time. It has been shown that deep partial-thickness wounds on the female, red Duroc pig heal with thick scars, which is similar to hypertrophic scar. As part of our validation of the Duroc model of hypertrophic scarring, we evaluated myofibroblasts in wounds on the Duroc pigs. Methods:? Superficial (0.015? to 0.030?) and deep (0.045? to 0.060?) wounds were created on the backs of 12 Durocs. Biopsies were taken at weeks 1, 2, 4, 15, and 21 postwounding. Samples were analyzed by immunochemical staining for alpha smooth muscle actin (a-SMA, for myofibroblasts) and heat-shock protein (HSP47, for fibroblasts). HSP47 positive cells were counted at 40X and the fraction of a-SMA positive cells out of fibroblasts was evaluated at 10X. Statistical significance was calculated with the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results:? The counts of HSP47 and a-SMA positive cells are shown in the table below. In brief, in deep wounds most of the HSP47 positive cells were a-SMA positive at 1 and 2 weeks but this declined rapidly thereafter. In shallow wounds there were far fewer cells positive for a-SMA and the decline was even more rapid. 1W 2W 4W 15W 21W Number Shallow 105?±?22 151?±?59 106?±?23 ?57?±?20 44?±?4 HSP47 Deep 524?±?45 449?±?35 231?±?73 108?±?30 55?±?8 P value <0.05 <0.05 <0.05 <0.05 Percent Shallow 23% 3% 0 0 0 a-SMA Deep 90% 74% 10% 0 0 P value <0.05 <0.05 Conclusions:? a-SMA positive fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) are present in deep Duroc wounds and the temporal pattern is similar to that reported for human hypertrophic scar. This further validates the female red Duroc model of human hypertrophic scarring.

AB  - Background:? Previously, we showed in a human forearm biopsy model of wound healing that acute healing dynamics can be characterized at the clinical and genetic level. Growth factor application by recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB (rhPDGF-BB) accelerates the velocity of wound healing and modulates gene expression in wounds. To profile the function, structure, and genomics of acute healing, the human results were compared with a murine model of acute circular and incisional wounds. Methods:? Full thickness 8?mm circular skin wounds and linear surgical incisional wounds were created in 6-week-old Balb-C mice and recombinant angiogenic growth factors (PDGF vs. PDGF/FGF2/VEGF) were administered topically to wounds daily. Velocity of healing and time to complete closure were determined by digital planimetry. Tissue was examined for histopathological, morphometric, functional, and gene expression parameters, and compared to human results. Results:? Acute healing velocity can be quantified and compared in human and murine models. Linear incisions heal in distinct morphological, immunohistochemical and gene expression patterns compared to circular wounds. The cellular profile shows differences between wound types. Topical PDGF accelerates angiogenesis and time to complete acute healing. Human and murine gene expression was correlated. Results will be presented. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Introduction:? This study examines the capacity of near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) to differentiate partial thickness burns. Methods:? Adult burn patients (n?=?19) presenting within 72 hours of injury and body surface area?<?20% were studied. An independent observer classified the burn injuries as either superficial (SPT, n?=?5) or deep partial (DPT, n?=?14) thickness. NIR data, oxygen saturation and total hemoglobin, were collected from the burn site and adjacent nonburned control site. NIR data for burn sites were compared to respective control sites to adjust for between subject variability. Skin biopsies for histologic analysis were performed at the time of surgery. Results:? NIR spectroscopy was able to detect a slight increase (3.65%, p?<?0.05) in oxygen saturation with SPT burns when compared to control sites. In contrast, DPT burns displayed a drop in oxygen saturation (17.65%, p?<?0.05) in comparison to the control site. An increase in total hemoglobin was observed for both the SPT (15.83%, p?<?0.05) and DPT (5.07%, p?<?0.05) injuries in comparison to control sites. SPT and DPT burns are discernible (p?<?0.01) based on oxygen saturation values but not total hemoglobin (p?>?0.4). Histologic and clinical correlation with the NIR spectroscopic data will be presented at the conference. Conclusions:? NIR spectroscopy can distinguish between superficial and deep partial thickness burn injuries in the first 3 days post burn injury. PSI grant

AB  - Abstract Introduction Obesity during pregnancy is associated with meta-inflammation and an increased likelihood of clinical complications. Surgery results in intense, acute inflammatory responses in any individual. Because obese individuals exhibit constitutive inflammatory responses and high rates of Caesarian section, it is important to understand the impact of surgery in such populations. Whether more pronounced pro-inflammatory cytokine responses and/or counterbalancing changes in anti-inflammatory immune modulators occurs is unknown. Here we investigated innate immune capacity in vivo and in vitro in non-obese, term-pregnant controls versus healthy, term-pregnant obese women (Class II, BMI 35?40). Methods Systemic in vivo induction of eleven pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers and acute phase proteins was assessed in plasma immediately prior to and again following Caesarian section surgery. Independently, innate immune capacity was examined by stimulating freshly isolated PBMC in vitro with a panel of defined PRR-ligands for TLR4, TLR8, TLR3, and RLR 24?h post-surgery. Results The kinetics and magnitude of the in vivo inflammatory responses examined were indistinguishable in the two populations across the broad range of biomarkers examined, despite the fact that obese women had higher baseline inflammatory status. Deliberate in vitro stimulation with a range of PRR ligands also elicited pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses that were indistinguishable between control and obese mothers. Conclusions Acute in vivo innate immune responses to C-section, as well as subsequent in vitro stimulation with a panel of microbial mimics, are not detectably altered in Class II obese women. The data argue that while Class II obesity is undesirable, it has minimal impact on the in vivo inflammatory response, or innate immunomodulatory capacity, in women selecting C-section.

AB  - Extracellular matrix laminins are the major noncollagenous components in the basement membrane zones (BMZ) and influence a variety of important biological processes including cell attachment, migration, and tissue development. A newly discovered laminin family member, laminin 10 (alpha 5, beta 1, and gamma 1), is found a major laminin present in the BMZs at the dermal-epidermal junction and dermal microvascular vessels. We examined the roles of laminin 10 in cutaneous wound repair in vitro and in vivo. Purified laminin 10 protein promoted human keratinocyte spreading and attachment, which is mediated by integrins. In human wound lesions, immunoperoxidase staining, with antibody 4C7 specific to laminin alpha 5 chain, stained strongly positive for laminin 10 in newly formed BMZs of epidermis and dermal blood vessels. Using a laminin 10 alpha 5 chain knockout mouse, excisional wounds in this model had abnormal reepithelialization and decreased granulation tissue formation. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of the BMZ of the mutant skin showed discontinuous lamina densa formation in areas between hemidesmosomes. In a porcine burn wound model, Reverse Transcription and Polymerase Chain Reaction analysis found significant higher expression of laminin 10 shortly after wounding and persisted through day 21, peaking at day 10. This expression pattern is consistent with the reconstitution of BMZs in the epidermis and microvascular blood vessels. These studies indicate that laminin 10 plays important roles in wound healing by promoting cell migration, BMZ assembly, reepithelialization, and angiogenesis. This study was supported by grants from NIH/NIAMES, DOD/DARPA and the Dermatology Foundation of South Florida.

AB  - Sympathetic-sensory coupling after L5 spinal nerve lesion in the rat and its relation to changes in dorsal root ganglion blood flow. (Christian-Albrechts-Universität, Kiel, Germany) Pain 2000;87:335?345. In rats 3-56 days after L5 spinal nerve lesion, the authors of this study tested the responses of axotomized afferent fibers recorded in the dorsal root of the lesioned segment to norepinephrine (NE, 0.5 ?g/kg) injected intravenously and to selective electrical stimulation of the lumbar sympathetic trunk (LST). In some experiments, blood flow was measured in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) by laser Doppler flowmetry. The majority of lesioned afferent fibers with spontaneous activity responded to neither LST stimulation (82.4%) nor NE (71.4%). In those that did react to LST stimulation, responses occurred only at high stimulation frequencies and they could be mimicked by nonadrenergic vasoconstrictor drugs (angiotensin II, vasopressin). Excitatory responses to LST stimulation were closely correlated with the stimulation-induced phasic vasoconstrictions in the DRG. Therefore, the activation of lesioned afferents might be brought about indirectly by an impaired blood supply to the DRG. To test this hypothesis, a strong and sustained baseline vasoconstriction in the DRG was induced by blocking endothelial nitric oxide synthesis with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) applied systemically. L-NAME enhanced baseline vascular resistance in the DRG about threefold and also increased stimulation-induced vasoconstrictions. After L-NAME, the majority of axotomized neurons with spontaneous activity were activated by LST stimulation (76%) or NE (75%). Again, activations closely followed stimulation-induced phasic vasoconstrictions in the DRG provided that a critical level of vasoconstriction was exceeded. Inhibitory responses to LST stimulation were generally rare and could be reversed to activation by prolonged stimulation or after L-NAME. These results show that sympathetic-sensory coupling occurs only in a minority of axotomized afferents after L5 spinal nerve injury. Like previous studies, they cast doubt on the notion that L5 spinal nerve lesion is a good model for sympathetically maintained pain. Since responses of lesioned afferent neurons to LST stimulation and NE could be provoked with high reliability after inducing vasoconstriction in the DRG, and since they mirrored stimulation-induced vasoconstrictions in the DRG, it appears that in this model the association of sympathetic activity with afferent discharge occurs mainly when perfusion of the DRG is impaired. Comments by Marshall Devor, PhD. Animal research has revealed that massive ectopic afferent discharge is generated in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) following nerve injury. This source of ectopic firing is in addition to activity that may be generated at the nerve injury site (Tinel sign). The combined impulse barrage is almost certainly an important cause of neuropathic pain. It has been discovered recently that the intensity of the ectopic DRG barrage is modulated by sympathetic efferent activity. This is a potential link between sympathetic activity and symptomatology in sympathetic related pain conditions such as complex regional pain syndrome/reflex sympathetic dystrophy. But what is the mechanism of the sympathetic-sensory coupling? Considerable evidence indicates that axotomized DRG neurons become abnormally adrenosensitivity. Habler et al now point out an additional, indirect, coupling mechanism ? modulation of intrinsic DRG blood flow. That is, sympathetic activity may reduce DRG blood flow inducing partial ischemia, with the ischemia causing neural excitation. This finding may also have broader implications as spinal pathology can also compromise DRG blood flow. Might low back pain and sciatica, for example, derive from this same process? It is surprising that ectopic firing in the DRG has played so little part in clinical thinking and practice in patients with neuropathic pain. So far.

AB  - Abstract Background To examine the outcomes of the implementation of a multidisciplinary nutrition support team (NST) that included a pharmacist for critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods Data were retrospectively collected from electronic medical records and compared between the pre-NST group (n = 73) and post-NST group (n = 75). Patients were included if they received enteral or parenteral nutrition support for at least 72 hours in the ICU of an approximately 900-bed, top-tier university medical center. The percentage of goal kcal, the percentage of goal protein, serum albumin level, total lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, duration of mechanical ventilation use, hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, and mortality were evaluated. Results There were significant differences in the percentage of goal kcal (66.9% ± 25.9% vs 86.2% ± 27.5%; P < 0.001) and the percentage of goal protein (67.0% ± 29.9% vs 81.7% ± 30.7%; P < 0.05) between the pre-NST and post-NST groups. A higher percentage of goal kcal was associated with a significant decrease in the ICU LOS (P < 0.05) and hospital LOS (P < 0.05). The percentage of goal kcal was associated with mortality rate (odd ratio, 0.977; 95% confidential interval, 0.959?0.996; P = 0.016). Conclusion Implementation of a multidisciplinary NST service for critically ill patients was associated with higher percentages of goal kcal and goal protein, as well as a shortened duration of mechanical ventilation use. Higher energy supply was associated with a reduced mortality rate.
