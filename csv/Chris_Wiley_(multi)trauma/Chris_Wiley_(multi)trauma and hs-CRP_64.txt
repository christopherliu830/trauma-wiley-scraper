AB  - Abstract The economic devastation caused in the past by the New World screwworm fly Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) to the livestock industry in the U.S.A., Mexico and the rest of Central America was staggering. The eradication of this major livestock pest from North and Central America using the sterile insect technique (SIT) as part of an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) programme was a phenomenal technical and managerial accomplishment with enormous economic implications. The area is maintained screwworm-free by the weekly release of 40?million sterile flies in the Darien Gap in Panama, which prevents migration from screwworm-infested areas in Columbia. However, the species is still a major pest in many areas of the Caribbean and South America and there is considerable interest in extending the eradication programme to these countries. Understanding New World screwworm fly populations in the Caribbean and South America, which represent a continuous threat to the screwworm-free areas of Central America and the U.S.A., is a prerequisite to any future eradication campaigns. The Old World screwworm fly Chrysomya bezziana Villeneuve (Diptera: Calliphoridae) has a very wide distribution ranging from Southern Africa to Papua New Guinea and, although its economic importance is assumed to be less than that of its New World counterpart, it is a serious pest in extensive livestock production and a constant threat to pest-free areas such as Australia. In the 1980s repeated introductions and an expansion of Old World screwworm populations were reported in the Middle East; in the 1990s it invaded Iraq and since late 2007 it has been reported in Yemen, where a severe outbreak of myiasis occurred in 2008. Small-scale field trials have shown the potential of integrating the SIT in the control of this pest and various international organizations are considering using the release of sterile insects as part of an AW-IPM approach on a much wider scale. Wohlfahrtia magnifica (Schiner) (Diptera: Sarcophagidae) is a screwworm of temperate regions, which, although of limited agricultural importance, has invaded several new locations in the past few years. This special issue reports on the results of a 6-year project funded by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/International Atomic Energy Agency (FAO/IAEA) Programme of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture entitled ?Enabling Technologies for the Expansion of the SIT for Old and New World Screwworm?. A major goal of the project was to better understand population genetic variation in screwworms as an aid to the identification of isolated populations. The project also addressed issues related to genetic sexing, cuticular hydrocarbons, population dynamics, genetic transformation and chromosome analysis.

AB  - Introduction:? Liposomal gene transfer is an effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of several pathophysiologic states. The purpose of the present study was to define whether the biological or chemical structure of a liposome influences cellular and biological regeneration in the skin and to determine by which mechanisms possible changes occur. Methods:? Rats were inflicted a full-excision acute wound and divided into three groups to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of DMRIE liposomes plus the Lac-Z gene, or DOTAP/Chol liposomes plus the Lac Z gene, or saline. Planimetry, immunological assays, histological, and immunohistochemical 'techniques were used to determine molecular mechanisms after gene transfer, protein expression, dermal, and epidermal regeneration. Results:? DOTAP/Chol increased IGF-I and KGF protein concentration and caused concomitant cellular responses, e.g., by increasing IGFBP-3, p?<?0.05. DOTAP/Chol liposomes improved epidermal regeneration by exhibiting the most rapid area and linear wound reepithelization compared to DMRIE or control, p?<?0.001. DOTAP/Chol and DMRIE exerted promitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects on basal keratinocytes, p?<?0.05. Dermal regeneration was improved in DOTAP/Chol treated animals by an increased collagen deposition and morphology, p?<?0.001. DOTAP/Chol liposomes increased VEGF concentrations and thus neovascularization when compared with DMRIE and saline, p?<?0.001. Summary:? In the present study we showed that different liposomes have different effects on intracellular and biological responses based on its chemical and molecular structure. For gene transfer in acute wounds the administration of DOTAP/Chol liposomes appears to be beneficial. Acknowledgments:? Clayton Foundation for Research

AB  - There are only a few models for studying epidermal migration in vitro, and their interpretation is made difficult by reliance on cell monolayers and the choice of a specific substrate. In this study, the process of keratinocyte migration and epiboly were investigated by using a bilayered bioengineered skin construct, consisting of human neonatal foreskin keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts (Apligraf, Organogenesis, Canton, MA). At baseline, 6-mm punch biopsies of the construct were placed in serum-free media (AIM-V) or DMEM with or without 10% FBS. At varying time points the bioengineered skin samples were processed and analyzed by histology and immunostaining. By 72 hours, in a time-dependent manner, the epidermis had migrated over and enveloped the entire dermis (full epiboly). Full epiboly was partially inhibited by serum and was maximal in serum-free medium. Epiboly was preserved 5 days after stated expiration date and was equivalent to that seen in unexpired construct when stored at room temperature. The process of epiboly was downregulated in a dose-dependent manner by neutralizing antibodies to EGF and TGF-beta 1. The migrating epithelium was characterized by decreased keratinocyte proliferation (as per Ki67 immunostaining) and increased expression of vitronectin (epibolin). Increasing concentrations of antibodies of vitronectin blocked the process of epiboly, as did antibodies to the alpha5-betaV integrin receptor, which mediates vitronectin-driven keratinocyte locomotion. Interesting, epiboly was also blocked by preseeding human dermal fibroblasts on the dermal side of the construct. We propose that the process of epiboly in this model can be used to better understand and assess the mechanisms involved in keratinocyte migration and may be used as an assay for establishing construct functional viability.

AB  - Abstract Aim Colorectal cancer patients on chemotherapy usually have elevated levels of inflammatory markers and experience numerous side effects from chemotherapy thereby leading to poor quality of life. Omega-3 fatty acid and microbial cell preparation (MCP) have been known to provide significant benefits in patients on chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of supplementation of omega-3 fatty acid and MCP in quality of life, chemotherapy side effects and inflammatory markers in colorectal cancer patients on chemotherapy. Methods A double-blind randomized study was carried out with 140 colorectal cancer patients on chemotherapy. Subjects were separated into two groups to receive either placebo or MCP [30 billion colony-forming unit (CFUs) per sachet] at a dose of two sachets daily for 4 weeks, and omega-3 fatty acid at a dose of 2 g daily for 8 weeks. Outcomes measured were quality of life, side effects of chemotherapy and levels of inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and C-reactive protein. Results The supplementation with MCP and omega-3 fatty acid improved the overall quality of life and alleviated certain side effects of chemotherapy. The supplementation with MCP and omega-3 fatty acid also managed to reduce the level of IL-6 (P = 0.002). There was a significant rise in the placebo group's serum TNF-α (P = 0.048) and IL-6 (P = 0.004). Conclusion The combined supplementation with MCP and omega-3 fatty acid may improve quality of life, reduce certain inflammatory biomarkers and relieve certain side effects of chemotherapy in colorectal patients on chemotherapy.

AB  - Background:? The cytokine signals that regulate myofibroblast differentiation and the resulting reorganization of matrix are incompletely understood. We studied the response of fibroblasts to mediators known to affect matrix reorganization, TGF-? and TNF-α in a collagen matrix. Further, we sought to determine if any cell phenotype changes resulted in quantifiable alterations in the mechanical performance of the matrix. Methods:? Normal human dermal fibroblasts were cultured in collagen type I lattices for 1 and 5 days in DMEM with .5% FBS and TGF-?(1?ng/ml), TNF-α(10?ng/ml), or combinations TGF-?(1?ng/ml)?+?TNF-α(1,5, and 10?ng/ml). Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to determine α-SMA expression. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure α-SMA mRNA. An indentation mechanical method was used to measure Young?s modulus which represents matrix stiffness. Results:? TGF-? increases α-SMA, while TNF-α alone has no effect on basal α-SMA expression. When TGF-??+?TNF-α were both added, the expression of α-SMA returned to basal levels. Immunohistochemistry showed α-SMA is incorporated into prominent stress fibers only in the TGF-? group. Real-time PCR showed that TNF-α did not affect α-SMA mRNA, while TGF-? increased α-SMA mRNA 19-fold. Combination treatment reduced mRNA level by 16-fold, to 2.7-fold compared to control. Indentation testing showed that, in all treatment groups, lattices after 5 days in culture were stiffer. TNF-α appeared to reduce the stiffness of the lattices on both day 1 and 5 compared to control. Conclusion:? TNF-α decreases TGF-? induction of α-SMA expression at the transcriptional level and decreases lattice stiffness. The cellular responses to cytokines are reflected in both biochemical and mechanical behaviors. Understanding both will be necessary to understand how tissues remodel into functional tissue and scar.

AB  - Background? This study was conducted to assess the management of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in a district hospital and to compare these results with national guidelines and the published literature. Materials And Methods? This prospective and retrospective study included 112 patients, mean age 66 years, who presented with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding between July 2004 and February 2005. All patients were assigned a Rockall risk assessment score. Results? The surgical on-call teams managed all the patients according to an agreed protocol. 49 patients had a Rockall score > or =?4. Endoscopy was performed in all patients, with 60% accomplished within the first 24 hours. The most common cause found was peptic ulcer (30%). Therapeutic endoscopy was undertaken in 10 patients (9%) with a success rate of 70%. Open surgery was performed in 3 patients. One patient died after having surgery and the Rockall score was >5. Of the patients admitted with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, 90.2% were discharged without complication. 11 patients died (9.8%) and all of them from the high risk group with Rockall scores >5. Their mean hospital stay was 17.8 days (range, 2?43 days). Conclusion? High-standard results in acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding can be achieved in a district hospital. The management, including the use of the operating theatre facilities with operative and anaesthetic support, was safe and efficient. A 24-hour-a-day endoscopy service is important to achieve early diagnosis and to plan management. A protocol and early endoscopy improve clinical outcome and reduce mortality, which occurred mostly among elderly patients with high risk scores. It is advisable to introduce the Rockall scoring system in practice.
