AB  - It has been known for many years that low levels of laser or noncoherent light (LLLT) accelerate some phases of wound healing. LLLT can stimulate fibroblast and keratinocyte proliferation and migration. It is thought to work via light absorption by mitochondrial cytochromes, increase in reactive oxygen species and consequent gene transcription. However, despite many reports about the positive effects of LLLT on wound healing, its use remains controversial. Our laboratory has developed a model of a full thickness excisional wound in mice that allows quantitative and reproducible light dose healing response curves to be generated. We have found a biphasic dose response curve with a maximum positive effect at 2?J/cm2 of 635-nm light and successively lower beneficial effects from 3?25?J/cm2, the effect is diminished at doses below 2?J/cm2 and gradually reaches control healing levels. At light doses above 25?J/cm2 healing is actually worse than controls. Although analysis of action spectra revealed the most effective light to be 635?nm, dose response curves are likely to be of similar shape for different wavelengths of light but at different absolute fluences. We found no difference between filtered 635?±?15-nm light from a lamp and 633-nm HeNe laser. Light alone (or a combination with other agents such as photosensitive dyes or matrix degrading enzymes) could be used for stimulation of wound healing. Our future work will be focused on understanding the mechanisms underlying effects of light on wound healing processes. We propose to examine various knockout and overexpressing mice to determine the precise mechanisms operating and to study mouse models of impaired wound healing to more closely define which patients might most benefit from LLLT.

AB  - Introduction:? Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) continue to present a formidable challenge in terms of morbidity and healthcare costs. Increasing evidence ascertains the important role of Matrix Metallo-Proteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors TIMPS in wound healing. Imbalance of MMPs in the DFU microenvironment has been associated with poor wound healing. Current research is directed toward therapeutic agents that could redress the imbalance of MMPs?/?TIMPs. Polyhydrated Ionogens (PHIs) formulation is based on metallic ions and citric acid. PHI application aims to positively restore MMP ratios within chronic wounds. This initial multicenter pilot study aimed to investigate the efficacy of the PHI formulation in achieving stable wound closure in recalcitrant DFUs. Methods:? Twenty-nine patients with therapy resistant DFUs of at least 2?cm2 and 3 months duration were treated with PHI formulation in an acetate carrier dressing. Wound debridement, digital imaging, and wound perimeter tracing were performed weekly. Serum samples and punch biopsies were taken from random ulcers for quantitative MMP/TIMP analysis at three time points to assess feasibility of this method. Patient satisfaction was assessed with a questionnaire. Results:? Stable wound closure with high patient satisfaction was achieved in 15 (75%) DFUs. MMP/TIMP ratios within different healing phases were delineated. Discussion:? This pilot study?s encouraging results prompt us to further investigate the PHI efficacy in DFU treatment in a Web-based, multicenter, randomized controlled trial.

AB  - Summary Dementia and cognitive impairment are very common and accompany many neurological as well as systemic diseases. This chapter first talks about delirium, dementia and cognitive impairment. Cognition, like other aspects of human brain function, has a modular organisation, and different cognitive functions have distinct anatomical substrates. The chapter then focuses on the differential diagnosis of delirium and dementia, and a structured approach to the investigation of cognitive impairment. Alzheimer's disease is the prototypical cortical dementia against which other dementias are compared in a differential diagnosis. The prion diseases are transmissible agents with unique composition and properties, being apparently devoid of significant nucleic acid. The greatest risk factor for development of dementia is age. However, there are several modifiable risk factors. Moderate exercise reduces the risk of dementia as does modification of vascular risk factors: obesity, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes, hypertension and smoking.

AB  - The American Society for Apheresis (ASFA) JCA Special Issue Writing Committee is charged with reviewing, updating and categorizating indications for therapeutic apheresis. Beginning with the 2007 ASFA Special Issue (Fourth Edition), the committee has incorporated systematic review and evidence-based approach in the grading and categorization of indications. This Sixth Edition of the ASFA Special Issue has further improved the process of using evidence-based medicine in the recommendations by consistently applying the category and GRADE system definitions, but eliminating the ?level of evidence? criteria (from the University HealthCare Consortium) utilized in prior editions given redundancy between GRADE and University HealthCare Consortium systems. The general layout and concept of a fact sheet that was utilized in the Fourth and Fifth Editions, has been largely maintained in this edition. Each fact sheet succinctly summarizes the evidence for the use of therapeutic apheresis in a specific disease entity. This article consists of 78 fact sheets (increased from 2010) for therapeutic indications in ASFA categories I through IV, with many diseases categorized having multiple clinical presentations/situations which are individually graded and categorized.

AB  - Background:? Activation of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway and production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), have been linked to dermal wound healing in fetal and adult tissue. Activation of this pathway has been previously linked to interleukin (IL)-1? expression. This study addresses the mechanism by which IL-1? regulates both production of and response to PGE2 in cultured human fetal and adult dermal fibroblasts. Hypothesis:? IL-1? regulates fetal and adult dermal fibroblast PGE2 signaling. Methods:? Fetal and adult dermal fibroblasts were isolated from human skin explants. Secretion of soluble mediators was assayed using ELISA kits. Expression of COX-2 as well as the various PGE2 receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4) was analyzed at both the mRNA and protein levels. Results:? Compared to adult fibroblasts, fetal fibroblasts produced decreased levels of IL-6 and IL-8, but similar levels of PGE2. IL-1?1 caused up-regulation of COX-2 and increased PGE2 secretion in both fetal and adult fibroblasts. However, administration of IL-1?, tumor necrosis factor-α or interferon-? did not significantly alter the mRNA or protein levels of any PGE2 receptor subtype. Discussion:? Our hypothesis is partially supported by the results. IL-1? causes up-regulation of COX-2 and increased PGE2 secretion in fetal and adult dermal fibroblasts, but does not alter the expression of PGE2 receptors. Therefore, proinflammatory mediator-induced changes in both fetal and adult skin fibroblasts appear to act through increased production of the signal molecules and not through increased or altered receptor expression for PGE2. This finding raises the possibility of increased autocrine signaling in the context of dermal inflammation, such as that associated with a wound healing response. Acknowledgments:? The authors would like to thank Children?s Hospital of Pittsburgh for providing funding for this research.

AB  - ABSTRACT HIV-infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART)-exposure are associated with bone loss. African data are limited despite the region's HIV burden. Of 247 ART-naïve, premenopausal, urban, black African women aged 33.9±6.6?years from Soweto, South Africa, measured at baseline, 110 underwent anthropometry, DXA and blood and urine collections at 12 and 24 months; 39 were HIV-negative (Nref), 28 were people with HIV (PWH) not ART-exposed for the duration of the study (ART-N) and 43 were PWH who were ART-exposed within the first 12 months (ART-Y). At baseline ART-Y had lower BMI and fat mass than Nref. Within 12 months of ART-initiation, aBMD had decreased at the lumbar spine and whole-body-less-head, despite increased weight, and hip aBMD had not increased in line with Nref. There was no evidence of further bone changes between 12 and 24 months. By 24 months, ART-Y had gained weight and fat mass, but remained lighter with less fat than Nref. ART-initiation normalized the low serum albumin of ART-Y at baseline but was associated with elevated bone turnover markers at 12 and 24 months. Vitamin D status and renal phosphate handling were normal. ART-N had similar aBMD and other characteristics to Nref throughout, except, unlike Nref, weight and fat mass did not increase and serum albumin decreased. This study in African women of childbearing age demonstrated that the bone loss that had occurred in these PWH after ART-initiation did not continue after 12 months and that bone loss did not occur in ART-unexposed PWH over 2?years. At 24 months, despite gains in weight and fat mass, ART-exposed women remained lighter, with lower aBMD, fat mass and higher bone turnover than women without HIV. More studies are required to establish if the bone loss and fat gain reverse, stabilize, or continue with further ART-exposure, particularly during and after menopause.

AB  - Introduction:?? The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines for patients presenting with iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) suggest patients should undergoing upper and lower gastrointestinal tract examination in addition to coeliac serology. Studies suggest that in approximately 20% of patients no diagnosis is made. In these patients subsequent management and risk of underlying malignancy remains unclear. In our unit all patients initially negative following investigation undergo an abdominal CT scan. Aim To determine 1) cancer detection and overall disease detection rates for patients referred with IDA on the cancer pathway 2) Subsequent outcomes of patients with no diagnosis made after initial investigations. Methods:?? Patients referred between Jan 2002 ? Jan 2005 were retrospectively reviewed with respect to 1) diagnosis following initial investigations 2) addition diagnosis following abdominal CT 3) Eventual outcome 3?years following presentations. Results:?? 111 patients were reviewed. Following initial investigation 12 colorectal and 2 gastric cancers were identified. 63% of patients had a diagnosis following initial investigations. Three patients were diagnosed with underlying malignancy following abdominal CT. 38 patients had no diagnosis, non reattended over a 3?year period with significant pathology. Conclusion:?? BSG guideline investigations with addition abdominal CT is sufficient to detect disease in patients with IDA.

AB  - Abstract:? The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are critically involved in inflammation and are activated by stress. This suggests that stressful circumstances may affect the chronic inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Fifty-six scientific publications of the past 15 years were reviewed to get insight into the possible impact of stressors (grouped in five categories) on the health status and HPA axis and ANS functioning of adult patients with RA. Our findings in this review were: (1) In response to mental and physical effort and applied physiological stressors, patients demonstrate ANS hyporesponsiveness and ?too normal? HPA axis responsiveness considering the elevated immune activity. A premorbid defect, past and current inflammatory activity, past and current stress, and physical deconditioning may explain disturbed physiological responses. (2) After brief naturalistic stressors, self-perceived and clinician's ratings of disease activity are increased; inflammation parameters have been insufficiently examined. (3) Major life events do not univocally affect disease status, but appear able to modify disease activity in a positive or negative way, depending on the nature, duration, and dose of the accompanying physiological stress response. (4) Enduring (e.g., work-related or interpersonal) stressors are associated with perceived health. Because this stressor category mingles with personality variables, the mere observation of a correlation does not prove that chronic stressors provoke health changes, although this might be the case. (5) Not one study rigorously examined the prospective hypothesis that past stressors (e.g., childhood victimization or pre-onset stressful incidents) may trigger RA or aggravate existing RA, which is a realistic belief for some patients.

AB  - 1 E. Ben-Menachem ( 1 Neurologkliniken, Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset, Goteberg, Sweden ) Lacosamide is in Phase 3 of clinical development for the adjunctive treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Currently the mode of action (MOA) is under investigation since it has been previously demonstrated that lacosamide does not share a MOA with other currently marketed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The drug can be administered orally or intravenously. Results from pharmacokinetic studies suggest that lacosamide has a low potential for drug-drug interactions, and it appears that lacosamide has a minimal risk for affecting the pharmacokinetics of commonly prescribed concomitant AEDs for the treatment of epilepsy. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial for the treatment of partial seizures (SP667), lacosamide was administered orally in doses of 200 mg, 400 mg and 600 mg divided in 2 daily doses. In this trial, lacosamide demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in seizure frequency over placebo. Moreover, the 50% responder rate (defined as patients with at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency) was statistically significant. A further trial (SP616) investigated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of IV lacosamide as replacement for oral lacosamide in patients with partial-onset seizures. The nature of AEs reported following 60- and 30 minute infusions of lacosamide was consistent with AEs reported following oral administration of lacosamide. Dose-related adverse events include dizziness, nausea, fatigue, ataxia, vision abnormal, diplopia, and nystagmus. The currently available results justify the further development of lacosamide for the treatment of epilepsy.
