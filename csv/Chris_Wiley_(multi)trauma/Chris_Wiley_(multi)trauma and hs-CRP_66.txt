AB  - Selenium is a component of selenoproteins with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), multiorgan dysfunction (MOD), and multiorgan failure (MOF) are associated with an early reduction in plasma selenium and glutathione peroxidase activity (GPx), and both parameters correlate inversely with the severity of illness and outcomes. Several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluated selenium therapy as monotherapy or in antioxidant cocktails in intensive care unit (ICU) patient populations, and more recently several meta-analyses suggested benefits with selenium therapy in the most seriously ill patients. However, the largest RCT on pharmaconutrition with glutamine and antioxidants, the REducing Deaths due to Oxidative Stress (REDOXS) Study, was unable to find any improvement in clinical outcomes with antioxidants provided by the enteral and parenteral route and suggested harm in patients with renal dysfunction. Subsequently, the MetaPlus study demonstrated increased mortality in medical patients when provided extra glutamine and selenium enterally. The treatment effect of selenium may be dependent on the dose, the route of administration, and whether administered with other nutrients and the patient population studied. Currently, there are few small studies evaluating the pharmacokinetic profile of intravenous (IV) selenium in SIRS, and therefore more data are necessary, particularly in patients with MOD, including those with renal dysfunction. According to current knowledge, high-dose pentahydrate sodium selenite could be given as an IV bolus injection (1000?2000 µg), which causes transient pro-oxidant, cytotoxic, and anti-inflammatory effects, and then followed by a continuous infusion of 1000?1600 µg/d for up to 10?14 days. Nonetheless, the optimum dose and efficacy still remain controversial and need to be definitively established.

AB  - The role of physical exercise and inactivity in pain recurrence and absenteeism from work after active outpatient rehabilitation for recurrent or chronic low back pain: A follow-up study. (DBC International, Vantaa, Finland) Spine 2000;25:1809?1816. This study analyzed the role of physical exercise and inactivity on long-term outcome after active outpatient low back rehabilitation. One hundred twenty-five patients with low back pain, who had participated in a 12-week active low back rehabilitation program, were asked about subjective pain and disability on the average of 14 months after the treatment. The outcomes were defined as a recurrence of persistent pain and work absenteeism, and a survival or failure analysis was performed between those who had continued exercising and who had been physically inactive. Recurrences of persistent pain during the follow-up period were fewer (P = 0.03) among those who had maintained regular exercise habits after the treatment than among those who had been physically inactive. Similarly, work absenteeism was less (P < 0.01) among physically active than among physically inactive persons. However, patients with good outcome in pain reduction after low back pain rehabilitation were more likely to participate in physical exercise. Conclude that exercises are beneficial after guided treatment in the maintenance of the results of active treatment for recurrent chronic low back pain in the long term, but those with less favorable outcome in rehabilitation are less likely to participate in exercises afterward. In active treatment programs, it is recommended that exercises be incorporated after the guided treatment. Comment by Phillip S. Sizer Jr., MEd, PT. Historically, clinicians have instructed their patients to use trunk exercise to reduce the severity and duration of the symptoms and functional losses associated with low back pain (LBP). Through the years increasing evidence has supported this notion. However, fewer investigators have evaluated the impact of exercise after the rehabilitation process has been completed. This investigation performed this evaluation and found that regular, postrehabilitation exercise improved long-term outcomes for patients who had previously suffered from LBP. Specifically, the investigators reported that ongoing exercise performed after an active outpatient rehabilitation program reduced recurrence of symptoms and absenteeism from work, especially after 1 year postonset. Additionally, these benefits did not appear to differ for those involved in self-guided exercises versus those participating in a guided program with back-specific devices in an outpatient treatment unit. This very interesting article reveals several pearls for the practitioner. First, subjects were not recruited on a voluntary basis, so to avoid attracting a group with good self-motivation to alleviate their prevailing symptoms. This measure allows the outcomes to be applicable to a varied clinical population. Secondly, although the results favored the use of a guided program with back specific devices over self-guided exercise, there were no statistical differences between the 2 approaches. Thus, patients can benefit from self-monitored exercise even when they do not have access to a guided program using specific devices. Finally, the investigators revealed that poor clinical rehabilitation outcomes predicted postrehabilitation inactivity and reduced success with posttreatment exercise. Thus, the effectiveness of the rehabilitation process may influence patient's activity level and success of exercise after rehabilitation.

AB  - Neurovascular decompression for idiopathic tarsal tunnel syndrome: technical note. (Fuji Brain Institute and Hospital, Fujinomiya City, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan) J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2000;69:87?90. This study evaluates the efficacy of neurovascular decompression for patients with tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS). Twelve feet from 9 patients with idiopathic TTS were treated. The patients were aged 52?78 years (mean 64.6 years), and all of them complained of pain or dysaesthesia of the sole of the foot. The posterior tibial nerve was freed from the attached arteriovenous complex (posterior tibial artery and veins). The dissected nerve had a flattened appearance in all of the patients, suggesting nerve compression by the adjacent arteriovenous complex and superficially by the flexor retinaculum. A graft of fat was inserted as both a cushion and an antiadhesive between the vessels and the nerve to achieve neurovascular decompression. Patients on whom neurovascular decompression was performed had resolution or lessening of symptoms in their feet. Neither wound infection nor recurrence of symptoms was found during the follow-up period (mean 26.8 months). Conclude neurovascular compression syndrome plays a part in idiopathic TTS, and adding neurovascular decompression to resection of the flexor retinaculum is effective. Comment by R. Ruiz-López, MD. The surgical outcome of idiopathic tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS) has been reported less than ideal and worse than that attributable to tarsal coalition tumor or ganglion. The authors considered necessary the development of a new technique in the surgical treatment of this syndrome assuming that neurovascular compression plays a part in idiopathic TTS. They treated 12 feet from 9 patients on whom neurovascular depression with a graft of fat adding resection to the flexor retinaculum was effective for the resolution or lessening of pain and paresthesia in all cases during a mean follow-up period of 26.8 months without complications.

AB  - Pain experience of children with headache and their families: a controlled study. (University of Turku, Turku, Finland) Pediatrics 2000;106:270?275. This study reported the pain sensitivity of children with headache and their family members as well as the prevalence of recurring aches, psychosocial life, and family environment of children with headache at preschool age. A representative population-based sample of 1443 families expecting their first child was followed over 7 years. A screening questionnaire relating to the child's headache was sent to parents of a representative sample of 1132 6-year-old children. Of 144 children suffering from headache, 106 (76%) were examined and interviewed clinically. Ninety-six children (58 migraine and 38 tension-type headache children) with primary headache and matched controls were included in further examinations. Children with headache were more often extremely sensitive to pain according to their parents, were more excited about physical examinations, cried more often during blood sampling or vaccination, avoided play or games more often because they were afraid of hurting themselves, and had recurring abdominal and growing pains more often than did control children. The fathers of children with headache were more often extremely sensitive to pain. Children with headache reacted with somatic symptoms, usually with pain and functional intestinal disorders in stress situations, felt more tired, and had more ideations of death during the previous month. More mothers of tension-type headache children than those of migraine children reported that they were considerably sensitive to pain. Tension-type headache children had a poorer family environment; the family atmosphere was more often unhappy and the relationship between parents was more often distant than in families of children with migraines. Conclude that in addition to somatic factors, it is important to consider the child's pain sensitivity, reaction to various stress situations, and family functioning when studying childhood headache. The child's coping mechanisms can be supported by information given by the parents. School entry can be considered a suitable period for careful investigation into possible occurrence of headache and also for giving information about headache and its management

AB  - Introduction The intrathecal space remains underutilized for diagnostic testing, invasive monitoring or as a pipeline for the delivery of neurological therapeutic agents and devices. The latter including drug infusions, implants for electrical modulation, and a means for maintaining the physiologic pressure column. The reasons for this are many but include unfamiliarity with the central nervous system and the historical risks that continue to overshadow the low complication rates in modern clinical series. Materials and Methods Our intent in this review is to explore the access devices currently on the market, assess the risk associated with breaching the intrathecal space, and propose a research model for bringing to patients the next generation of intrathecal hardware. For this purpose, we reviewed both historical and contemporary literature that pertains to the access devices and catheters intended for both temporary and permanent implantation and the complications thereof. Results There are few devices that are currently marketed in the United States or Europe for intrathecal use. Most hew to a relatively fixed design pattern predicated on the dimensions and properties of the thecal sac. All are typically composed of soft silicone, and employ a Tuohy needle for access despite design limitations. In general, these catheters are engineered for durability, ease of use, and regional deployment. Devices on the market with steerability or targeted intrathecal fixation are not yet available. Complications, once a legitimate concern, are now quite rare when recommended techniques are followed. Conclusions Over the next decade, advances in intrathecal catheter design, access techniques, imaging, and greater understanding of the spinal cord neurophysiology will usher in an era where the intrathecal space is recognized as a highly valued diagnostic and therapeutic target. We anticipate that this will occur in several concurrent phases, each with the potential to accelerate the growth of the others.
