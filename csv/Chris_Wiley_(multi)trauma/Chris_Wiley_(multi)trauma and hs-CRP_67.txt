AB  - Abstract Background Neuropathy can lead not only to impaired function but also to sensory sensitization. We aimed to link reduced skin nerve fibre density in different levels to layer-specific functional impairment in neuropathic pain patients and tried to identify pain-specific functional and structural markers. Methods In 12 healthy controls and 36 patients with neuropathic pain, we assessed clinical characteristics, thermal thresholds (quantitative sensory testing) and electrically induced pain and axon reflex erythema. At the most painful sites and at intra-individual control sites, skin biopsies were taken and innervation densities in the different skin layers were assessed. Moreover, neuronal calcitonin gene-related peptide staining was quantified. Results Perception of warm, cold and heat pain and nerve fibre density were reduced in the painful areas compared with the control sites and with healthy controls. Warm and cold detection thresholds correlated best with epidermal innervation density, whereas heat and cold pain thresholds and axon reflex flare correlated best with dermal innervation density. Clinical pain ratings correlated only with epidermal nerve fibre density (r?=?0.38, p?<?0.05) and better preserved cold detection thresholds (r?=?0.39, p?<?0.05), but not with other assessed functional and structural parameters. Conclusions Thermal thresholds, axon reflex measurements and assessment of skin innervation density are valuable tools to characterize and quantify peripheral neuropathy and link neuronal function to different layers of the skin. The severity of small fibre neuropathy, however, did not correspond to clinical pain intensity and a specific parameter or pattern that would predict pain intensity in peripheral neuropathy could not be identified.

AB  - Effect of peripheral morphine in a human model of acute inflammatory pain. (Hvidovre University Hospital, Hvidovre, Denmark) BR J Anaesth 2000;85:228?232. This study used a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover design in a human model of acute inflammatory pain (heat injury). Eighteen healthy volunteers were studied who each received morphine locally (2 mg), morphine systemically (2 mg), or placebo on three separate study days. The subjects received morphine infiltration subcutaneously (s.c.) 1 h before heat injury (47°C, 7 min) and naloxone infiltration s.c. (0.2 mg) 2.5 h after the heat injury. Hyperalgesia to mechanical and heat stimuli were examined using von Frey hairs and thermodes, and pain was rated using a visual analogue scale. The burns produced significant hyperalgesia, but local morphine infiltration neither reduced pain during the burn, nor primary or secondary hyperalgesia to mechanical and heat stimuli after the burn. Conclude peripherally applied morphine had no acute antinociceptive effects in this human model of acute inflammatory pain. Comment by Hemmo A. Bosscher, MD. This study is well controlled for placebo effect and the systemic effect of subcutanuously injected morphine. One of the few criticisms that can be made is the amount of narcotic injected. This may not be enough to bind to a sufficient number of receptors. One would expect some role for peripheral opioid receptors. The other comment would be that this type of injury (mainly small fiber involvement in this case) does not represent all types of nociception and, therefore, the peripheral action of morphine can not be excluded for different types of nociception. But overall this is a convincing study, consistent with the literature.

AB  - The SAT SET course is an innovative course designed by the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in response to a need to meet the challenges posed by the new SET training program. The course aims to teach current Fellows of the College a number of skills and evaluation methods required of surgical supervisors in assessment and performance management. Specifically, the course demonstrates effective use of the Mini-CEX and DOPS (Direct Observation of Procedural Skills) for initial and mid-term assessment of trainees; discusses the College's training policies and relevant legal issues such as the appeals process, as well as explaining expectations of their roles as supervisors and trainers. The course is a forerunner in Australia in active teaching of modern competency-based assessment tools implemented across a number of disciplines and workplace environments. From its commencement in May 2007 until September 2008, 555 Fellows have participated in SAT SET courses convened in Australia and New Zealand (229 in 2007, 326 in 2008). In addition, 185 SET Supervisor Fellows have attended the course, approximately 40% of all Surgical Supervisors in Australasia. Our survey aims to test the outcomes of the SAT SET course by the cumulative feedback from Supervisors who have attended the course and follow-up. Future iterations to improve the course, such as video demonstration of mid-term assessment, co-badging of SAT SET courses with hospitals and expansion of resources for facilitators will also be discussed.

AB  - Pain children: a common experience. (Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) Pain 2000;87:51?57. This study analyzed the prevalence of pain in Dutch children from 0 to 18 years of age. A random sample of 1300 children 0?3 years of age was taken from the register of population in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. In the Rotterdam area, 27 primary schools and 14 secondary schools were selected to obtain a representative sample of 5336 children from 4?18 years of age. Depending on the age of the child, a questionnaire was either mailed to the parents (0?3 years) or distributed at school (4?18 years). Of 6636 children surveyed, 5424 (82%) responded; response rates ranged from 64% to 92%, depending on the subject age and who completed the questionnaire. Of the respondents, 54% had experienced pain within the previous 3 months. Overall, a quarter of the respondents reported chronic pain (recurrent or continuous pain for more than 3 months). The prevalence of chronic pain increased with age, and was significantly higher in girls (P < 0.001). In girls, a marked increase occurred in reporting chronic pain between 12 and 14 years of age. The most common types of pain in children were limb pain, headache, and abdominal pain. Half of the respondents who had reported pain reported to have multiple pain, and one-third of the chronic pain sufferers experienced frequent and intense pain. These multiple pains and severe pains were more often reported by girls (P < 0.001). The intensity of pain was higher in the case of chronic pain (P < 0.001) and multiple pains (P < 0.001), and for chronic pain the intensity was higher for girls (P < 0.001). These findings indicate that chronic pain is a common complaint in childhood and adolescence. In particular, the high prevalence of severe chronic pain and multiple pain in girls aged 12 years and over calls for follow-up investigations documenting the various bio-psycho-social factors related to this pain.
