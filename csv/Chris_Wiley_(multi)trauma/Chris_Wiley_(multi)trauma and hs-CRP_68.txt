AB  - Abstract Objectives Pleural infection is a condition commonly encountered by the respiratory physician. This review aims to provide the reader with an update on the most recent data regarding the epidemiology, microbiology, and the management of pleural infection. Data source Medline was searched for articles related to pleural infection using the terms ?pleural infection,? ?empyema,? and ?parapneumonic.? The search was limited to the years 1997-2017. Only human studies and reports in English were included. Results A rise in the incidence of pleural infection is seen worldwide. Despite the improvement in healthcare practices, the mortality from pleural infection remains high. The role of oral microflora in the etiology of pleural infection is firmly established. A concise review of the recent insights on the pathogenesis of pleural infections is presented. A particular focus is made on the role of tPA, DNAse and similar substances and their interaction with inflammatory cells and how this affects the pathogenesis and treatment of pleural infection. Conclusion Pleural infection is a common disease with significant morbidity and mortality, as well as a considerable economic burden. The role of medical management is expanding thanks to the widespread use of newer treatments.

AB  - Can discography cause long-term back symptoms in previously asymptomatic subjects? (Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA) Spine 2000;25:1803?1808. This prospective controlled study aimed to determine whether discography might cause long-term low back symptoms in selected patients. Twenty-six patients without preexisting low back pain were observed for 1 year after lumbar discography to determine the effects of lumbar discography in 3 experimental groups: 10 patients who had remote cervical spine surgery with excellent results (pain-free group); 10 patients who had the same surgery with poor results (chronic pain group); and 6 patients who had primary somatization disorders. Two control groups were also observed: a group of patients with somatization disorder who were similarly evaluated but without discography and a group of patients with low back pain observed for 1 year after discography without surgery. In the 3 experimental groups (no back pain before discography) no subject with normal psychometric testing had persistent pain after discography (0/11), whereas 6 (40%) of the 15 with abnormal psychometric tests results reported significant new low back pain. None of the pain-free group (0/10), 20% of the chronic neck pain group (2/10), and 66% of the somatization group (4/6) continued to have significant back pain 1 year after injection. Psychological testing and occupational disability strongly predicted continued pain after discography. The control groups had no significant change in low back symptomatology during the year of observation. Conclude that discography in a subject group without low back pain, but with significant emotional and chronic pain problems may result in reports of significant back pain for at least 1 year after injection. Subjects with normal psychometric test results had no reports of significant long-term back pain after discography.

AB  - Introduction:?? Although modern surgery is often complex, adherence to simple but critical safety steps have been shown to markedly improve patient outcomes. Aim:?? To review and compare surgical practice at a tertiary surgical centre to recommendations from the WHO Safe Surgery Saves Lives Committee. Methodology:?? Retrospective analysis of all prospectively recorded surgical adverse events over an 18?month period (1st Jan 2007?30th June 2008). These events were compared to the WHO recommendations. Results:?? The tertiary centre practiced all but 3 of the WHO recommendations and 166 surgical adverse events and 23 process failures/near misses were identified. Rate of adverse events was better than the average reported in industrialised nations. Leading adverse events were infection and bleeding/haematoma. Seventeen percent of adverse events identified could have been modified had a ?sign-out? process been followed. Conclusion:?? Implementation of WHO recommendations has the potential to reduce surgical adverse events.

AB  - Introduction:?? Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide including Australia. Adjuvant chemotherapy improved survival in patients with Dukes? C CRC. Yet, not all Dukes? C CRC are referred to medical oncology and subsequently received adjuvant chemotherapy. Purposes:?? To analyse factors influencing referral to medical oncology in patients with Dukes? C Colonic cancer in our institutions. Methods:?? Prospective database on patients underwent resection for CRC, was collected at our institutions between 1991 to July 2007. Univariate and multivariate analysis of factors including demographic, institution based, timing of surgery, complications and length of hospitalisation on the pattern of medical oncology referral. P value of 0.05 or less was considered to be significant. Results:?? 466 patients were identified to have Dukes? C colonic cancer, 251 (53.9%) females and 215 (46.1%) males. 272 (58.4%) were referred to medical oncology. Univariate analysis revealed Age, Sex, ASA grade, underwent resection in private hospitals and underwent elective resection were statistically significant associated with medical oncology referrals. Age, underwent elective resection and underwent resection in private hospitals were the independent factors on multivariate analysis. The probability of medical oncology referral in those underwent elective resection was 63% vs. 41% in those underwent emergency resection, similarly 69% in those underwent resection in private hospitals vs. 50% in public hospitals. Conclusion:?? Referrals to medical oncology for adjuvant chemotherapy in Dukes? C colonic cancer were more likely in younger patients, underwent elective resection and underwent surgery in private hospitals.

AB  - Purpose:?? Providing enteral supplements containing ?immunonutrition? has been proposed to decrease postoperative complications and duration of hospital stay for elective surgical patients. This meta-analysis was undertaken to elucidate the potential benefit of providing immune-enhanced nutrition in surgical patients. Methodology:?? A search of Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, PubMed and the Cochrane Database identified all RCTs comparing the use of perioperative immunonutrition with standard nutrition provision in elective adult surgical patients between 1990 and 2008. The variables analysed included mortality, total complications, infective complications, anastomotic leak and length of hospital stay. Results:?? 21 distinct studies were identified that met inclusion criteria involving 2135 patients (immunonutrition n = 1100; standard nutrition n = 935). The provision of immunonutrition was shown to be associated with significant reductions in the incidence of total postoperative complications (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37, 0.69, p < 0.0001), postoperative infective complications (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37, 0.60, p < 0.0001), anastomotic breakdown (OR 0.43, 95% 0.25, 0.75, p = 0.003), and the duration of hospital stay (WMD ?2.95, 95% CI ?4.01, ?1.88, p < 0.0001) when compared to standard nutritional provision. No differences were seen between interventions with relation to mortality (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.41, 1.97. p = 0.8). Conclusion:?? Provision of immunonutrition in preference to standard nutrition was associated with clinically significant decreased length of hospital stay, reduction in the development of postoperative complications including those of infective origin and anastomotic breakdown but has no impact on mortality.

AB  - Introduction:?? Infarction of the greater omentum is a rare entity representing 0.1% of the total laparotomies performed for acute abdomen. Materials and Methods:?? Prospectively collected data was retrospectively analysed for the last three calendar years from Jan 2006 to Dec 2008. A total of five cases of Primary Omental torsions were identified of which four were managed laparoscopically and one was managed conservatively. Discussion:?? The cause of Primary (Idiopathic) segmental infraction of the greater Omentum is unknown. The possible mechanisms are arterial micro thrombosis or venous thrombosis secondary to stretching of the Omental veins, and precipitating factors such anomalous arterial supply to the omentum, kinking of vein secondary to increase intra-abdominal pressure and vascular congestion after large meals have been suggested. Here we present five cases, all males, ranging from ages of 23 to 55?years with a primary presenting complaint of abdominal pain. Only one of these had a previous appendectomy while two had other abdominal surgeries. The working diagnosis was that of an acute abdomen and four of these underwent laparoscopy and Omentectomy. One of them was conservatively managed. Postoperatively there was an immediate relief of pain and the recovery was uneventful with no mortality. Conclusion:?? The aim of this article is to share our experience in the diagnosis and management of this rare condition successfully with minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery in our regional centre, and a brief review of the literature.
