AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is a critical mediator of normal tissue repair and is inhibited by homocysteine (Hcy). Following 8 weeks of lower extremity ulcer (LEU) treatment with human fibroblast-derived dermal substitute (Dermagraft?) for 12 (n?=?12) patients, a correlation was observed between patients with a poor wound healing response to Dermagraft and elevated serum homocysteine (Hcy). The responders group (R) to Dermagraft treatment (n?=?6) was observed with robust granulation tissue, epidermal migration and a 67% rate of healed ulcerations. All R-group patients (6/6) had normal serum Hcy. The nonresponders (NR) group (n?=?6) exhibited poor granulation tissue formation and epidermal migration and a complete absence of healed wounds. Five of the NR patients (5/6) were observed with elevated serum Hcy. There was no significant (p?<?0.05) difference between the wound areas (cm2?±?SE) of each group [35.43(±28.99)-R vs. 19.90(±7.55)-NR]. After 2 weeks of treatment, the R-group demonstrated significantly greater %?wound area than the NR-group [62.17 (±7.96)-R group vs. 23.17(±8.82)-NR group; p?<?0.05]. Wound fluid nitrate (WFNOx), a surrogate measurement (?M?±?SE) for local NO bioactivity, was significantly lower for the NR-group than the R-group [3.17(±1.46)?M-NR group vs. 12.98(±1.73)?M-R group; p?<?0.05]. In a large group of LEU patients (n?=?138) we observed a 50% incidence of elevated Hcy; 69% for diabetic neuropathic LEU patients and 47% for nondiabetic LEU patients. Hcy inhibits NO production by multiple pathways and may also inhibit wound repair by occupying the fibronectin domain of fibrin during provisional matrix formation. Our study suggests that elevated serum Hcy is a common finding in chronic LEU patients. The high Hcy may contribute to impaired wound healing by decreasing wound NO production and, perhaps, by inhibition of fibronectin-fibrin-mediated wound matrix development.

AB  - Purpose:?? Inguinal hernia repair is a common operation with much focus in recent times on improving morbidity. The use of mesh repair has greatly decreased reoccurrence rates and focus turns towards improving postoperative groin pain. This review examines the use of UHS in inguinal hernia repair and relation with postoperative groin pain. Methods:?? A retrospective audit of consecutive cases over one year (telephone and mailed questionnaires) was conducted. The recently validated IPQ (inguinal pain score) was used. A review of files and operative reports was also undertaken. Cases undergoing bilateral repair, or other operations simultaneously were excluded. Results:?? 59 patients (61%) participated in the audit, with a mean follow up of 11?months (range 5?16). 4 minor wound complications occurred. Higher pain scores appeared to correlate preoperatively with age and workers compensation status. Postoperative pain scores and limitation to functional status were low, and trended towards lower values in the UHS (ultrapro hernia system) repair group compared to the group who underwent repair with PHS (preceding week pain scores respectively ?UHS repair, mean 1.22, (95%CI 1.07?1.38); PHS 1.76, (95%CI 1.11?2.43)). The average time until pain disappeared in the groin was within one month (IPQ score of 1.27). For those patients still experiencing any pain, (14 of 59; 23.7%) it occurred on average, once per week for minutes to hours and was at a level that could be ignored. Conclusion:?? Inguinal hernia repair with UHS appears to be a safe procedure with minimal complications and a favourable postoperative chronic pain profile.

AB  - Currently, skin cells or tissues intended for therapeutical or cosmetic applications are typically cultured using standard in vitro culture techniques. The avian chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) has been traditionally used for many years to assess angiogenesis of exogenous substances. Avian embryos have also been used to generate viruses for vaccine development. Most of the uses of the avian CAM cultures are typically conducted in ovo. However, xenobiotic cultures of ex ovo avian embryos and explanted organs, tissues or cells from human or other mammalian origin have not been used in the past with the explicit purpose of achieving the appropriate extent of expansion, differentiation or vascularization required for therapeutic or cosmetic implantation into humans or animals. Here, a novel method of xenobiotic skin culture was developed that can be employed for wound healing studies or for tissue engineering applications to sustain the culture of live skin explants through the benefit of a xenobiotic vascularization. The method uses fertile Japanese quail (Cortunix cortunix japonica) eggs. The eggs were incubated for at least 3 days in ovo using a static egg incubator. On day 3 the egg is opened under sterile conditions through the air chamber and placed in a cylindrical culture dish slightly larger than the overall diameter of the egg yolk. The embryo was then cultured at 37?°C for an additional 24 to 48 hours until a well-vascularized CAM covers the entire surface of the culture dish. Next, fragments of skin were placed directly over the CAM. The cultures were continued for 8 days and then the skin explants were transferred to new CAMs. These changes, every 8 days, were done at least five times allowing the skin to be maintained in culture for several weeks without apparent damage in viability. The skin fragments remained viable and capable of reepithelialization when wounded. Skin explants from both mouse and human were successfully cultured in this manner. Because immunological response cannot occur in the embryonic culture environment, it was possible to xenotransplant skin fragments without risk of rejection. The ensuing embryonic vessels developed into the xenotransplanted skin and generated a permeable vascular network that provided oxygen and nutrients necessary to ensure viability and promote proliferation and differentiation. Viability of the explants was evaluated by immunohisto chemical methods using proliferation and apoptosis markers (Caspase-3, BrdU, and PCNA). Vascularization was assessed using species-specific anti endothelial antibodies (anti-PECAM human and mouse and QH1 and QH2 monoclonal antibodies). The new method described herein has the distinct advantage of sustaining live, functional skin cultures by means of a rich vascular supply that provides cells with nutrients and oxygen.

AB  - Abstract Purpose Necrotizing soft tissue infection, also known as necrotizing fasciitis (NF), is a fast-spreading life-threatening infection that most commonly affects the lower limbs, groin, or abdomen. Periocular necrotizing fasciitis (PNF) is rare. Limited data exist on PNF immune cell subset; hence, this study aims to determine the representation of immune cell subsets in patients diagnosed with PNF using immunohistochemical stainings. Methods All patients diagnosed with PNF at Copenhagen University Hospital from 2008 to 2018 were included. Their electronic medical records and pathology reports were assessed, and available tissue specimens were reviewed and stained with monoclonal antibodies for CD1a+ Langerhans? cells, CD3+ T lymphocytes, CD15+ granulocytes, CD44+ lymphohematopoietic cells, CD68+ histiocytes, CD79α+ B lymphocytes, and FXIIIa+ dendritic macrophages and Langerhans? cells. The number of positive cells was counted, and an average score was calculated. The location of immune cells and bacteria was assessed. Results The specimens were characterized by acute inflammation and necrosis of the fascia, while striated muscle involvement was less frequent. Haemolytic group A streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus were identified and mainly located in the deep dermis and subcutis in close relation to the fascia. Only few areas harboured both bacteria and inflammatory cells. Granulocytes, histiocytes and CD44+ lymphohematopoietic cells were demonstrated to be abundant in all patients, while B and T lymphocytes, dendritic macrophages and Langerhans? cells were less frequent. Conclusion The immune cell subsets found in this study of PNF were consistent with those identified in the literature on NF in other anatomical locations. This study concludes that immune cells are abundant and exhibit a typical pattern in PNF.

AB  - Chronic nonhealing wounds have been long associated with an imbalance between the degrading metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs). Human and animal studies have shown psychological stress to impair healing and differentially regulate gene expression. We hypothesized that psychological stress-impaired healing is mediated by altered expression of MMP and TIMP. SKH-1 mice were subjected to restraint stress 3 days before and 5 days after placement of 3.5?mm biopsy wounds. The wounds were biopsied at various time points and analyzed for gene expression by real-time PCR. The wounds of stressed mice showed significantly delayed healing when compared to the wounds of controls through day 5 postwounding. There was a significantly higher expression of MMP-8 in the stressed groups on days 1 (172%, p?<?0.0003) and 3 (204%, p?<?0.0003) postwounding. Stress decreased MMP-9 expression on day 5 postwounding (56%, p?<?0.02), but showed no significant difference to controls on the other days. TIMP-1, which is known to inhibit most activated MMPs, had significantly lower expression on day 5 postwounding (56%, p?<?0.0003). TIMP-2, which is constitutively expressed, did not show any difference in expression between the stress and the control groups. During stress, increased MMP-8 (neutrophil collagenase) activity is in agreement with previous studies in our model that have demonstrated a increase in neutrophil recruitment on days 3 and 5 postwounding. Likewise, lower expression of TIMP-1 during stress is similar to findings in chronic wounds as opposed to healing surgical wounds. Hence, altered expression of the metalloproteinases and their inhibitors, may lead to increased damage early in healing and decreased repair later in stress-impaired wound healing.

AB  - Individuals with psychiatric disorders have elevated rates of autoimmune comorbidity and altered immune signaling. It is unclear whether these altered immunological states have a shared genetic basis with those psychiatric disorders. The present study sought to use existing summary-level data from previous genome-wide association studies to determine if commonly varying single nucleotide polymorphisms are shared between psychiatric and immune-related phenotypes. We estimated heritability and examined pair-wise genetic correlations using the linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and heritability estimation from summary statistics methods. Using LDSC, we observed significant genetic correlations between immune-related disorders and several psychiatric disorders, including anorexia nervosa, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, smoking behavior, and Tourette syndrome. Loci significantly mediating genetic correlations were identified for schizophrenia when analytically paired with Crohn's disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and ulcerative colitis. We report significantly correlated loci and highlight those containing genome-wide associations and candidate genes for respective disorders. We also used the LDSC method to characterize genetic correlations among the immune-related phenotypes. We discuss our findings in the context of relevant genetic and epidemiological literature, as well as the limitations and caveats of the study.

AB  - Abstract The economic devastation caused in the past by the New World screwworm fly Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) to the livestock industry in the U.S.A., Mexico and the rest of Central America was staggering. The eradication of this major livestock pest from North and Central America using the sterile insect technique (SIT) as part of an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) programme was a phenomenal technical and managerial accomplishment with enormous economic implications. The area is maintained screwworm-free by the weekly release of 40?million sterile flies in the Darien Gap in Panama, which prevents migration from screwworm-infested areas in Columbia. However, the species is still a major pest in many areas of the Caribbean and South America and there is considerable interest in extending the eradication programme to these countries. Understanding New World screwworm fly populations in the Caribbean and South America, which represent a continuous threat to the screwworm-free areas of Central America and the U.S.A., is a prerequisite to any future eradication campaigns. The Old World screwworm fly Chrysomya bezziana Villeneuve (Diptera: Calliphoridae) has a very wide distribution ranging from Southern Africa to Papua New Guinea and, although its economic importance is assumed to be less than that of its New World counterpart, it is a serious pest in extensive livestock production and a constant threat to pest-free areas such as Australia. In the 1980s repeated introductions and an expansion of Old World screwworm populations were reported in the Middle East; in the 1990s it invaded Iraq and since late 2007 it has been reported in Yemen, where a severe outbreak of myiasis occurred in 2008. Small-scale field trials have shown the potential of integrating the SIT in the control of this pest and various international organizations are considering using the release of sterile insects as part of an AW-IPM approach on a much wider scale. Wohlfahrtia magnifica (Schiner) (Diptera: Sarcophagidae) is a screwworm of temperate regions, which, although of limited agricultural importance, has invaded several new locations in the past few years. This special issue reports on the results of a 6-year project funded by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/International Atomic Energy Agency (FAO/IAEA) Programme of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture entitled ?Enabling Technologies for the Expansion of the SIT for Old and New World Screwworm?. A major goal of the project was to better understand population genetic variation in screwworms as an aid to the identification of isolated populations. The project also addressed issues related to genetic sexing, cuticular hydrocarbons, population dynamics, genetic transformation and chromosome analysis.
