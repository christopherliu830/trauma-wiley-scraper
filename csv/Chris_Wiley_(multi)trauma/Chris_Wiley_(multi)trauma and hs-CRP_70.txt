AB  - Cervical disc herniation in a patient with congenital insensitivity to pain: a case report. (University of Pittsburg Medical center, Pittsburg, PA) Spine 2000;25:1726?1728. This report discussed the clinical manifestations and the treatment outcome of a patient with a known diagnosis of congenital insensitivity to pain who developed a herniated cervical disc. The patient had neurologic motor weakness with ?neck and shoulder pain.? A clear radicular pattern could not be elicited. The patient underwent a successful anterior discectomy and fusion with long-term clinical and radiographic results. Conclude that patients with congenital insensitivity to pain who develop a cervical disc herniation may present with atypical symptoms not manifesting in the classic radicular pattern. Higher index of suspicion by the clinician must be practiced to make the appropriate diagnosis. Successful surgical outcome may be achieved in these patients.

AB  - Pure trigeminal motor neuropathy: a case report. (Korea University Medical Center, Guro-gu, Korea) Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2000;81:995?998. A 38-year-old man complaining of progressive weakness and wasting of the right masticatory muscles after a bout of mild cold symptoms is presented in this case report. No sensory symptoms were present. History, neurologic examination, electrophysiologic studies, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain led to the diagnosis of pure trigeminal motor neuropathy. The cause may have been an autoimmune reaction to a viral infection. Comment by Miles Day, MD. This article is a case report of pure trigeminal motor neuropathy. Trigeminal motor neuropathy is defined as a trigeminal motor paralysis accompanied by no trigeminal sensory signs or other cranial nerve involvement. The author described the history of the patient and their work up including examination, laboratory tests, and electro diagnostic examinations, which all pointed to the pure trigeminal motor neuropathy. The strength of this case report is the detailed description of the anatomy of the trigeminal nerve and the muscular innervations of the mandubular branch. The authors attributed the motor neuropathy to a possible post viral infection autoimmune response that predominantly affected the motor division of the trigeminal nerve. They have stressed that all other potential causes of motor neuropathy should be ruled out including malignancy in mass lesions.

AB  - Background Most approaches to transient ischaemic attack (TIA) triage use clinical scores and vascular imaging; however, some biomarkers have been suggested to improve the prognosis of TIA patients. Methods Serum levels of copeptin, adiponectin, neopterin, neuron-specific enolase, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, IL-6, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, S100?, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and IL-1α as well as clinical characteristics were assessed on consecutive TIA patients during the first 24 h of the onset of symptoms. Results Among 237 consecutive TIA patients, 12 patients (5%) had a stroke within 7 days and 15 (6%) within 90 days. Among all candidate biomarkers analysed, only copeptin was significantly increased in patients with stroke recurrence (SR) within 7 days (P = 0.026) but not within 90 days. A cut-off point of 13.8 pmol/l was established with a great predictive negative value (97.4%). Large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) [hazard ratio (HR) 12.7, 95% CI 3.2?50.1, P < 0.001] and copeptin levels ≥13.8 pmol/l (HR 3.9, 95% CI 1.01?14.4, P = 0.039) were independent predictors of SR at the 7-day follow-up. LAA was the only predictor of 90-day SR (HR 7.4, 95% CI 2.5?21.6, P < 0.001). ABCD3I was associated with 7- and 90-day SRs (P = 0.025 and P = 0.034, respectively). The association between copeptin levels and LAA had a diagnostic accuracy of 90.3%. Conclusions Serum copeptin could be an important prognostic biomarker to guide management decisions among TIA patients. Therefore, TIA patients with copeptin levels below 13.8 pmol/l and without LAA have an insignificant risk of 7-day SR and could be managed on an outpatient basis.

AB  - Objective There is a widely recognised need to develop effective Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers to aid the development of disease-modifying treatments, to facilitate early diagnosis and to improve clinical care. This overview aims to summarise the utility of key neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for AD, before focusing on the latest efforts to identify informative blood biomarkers. Design A literature search was performed using PubMed up to September 2011 for reviews and primary research studies of neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, positron emission tomography and amyloid imaging), CSF and blood-based (plasma, serum and platelet) biomarkers in AD and mild cognitive impairment. Citations within individual articles were examined to identify additional studies relevant to this review. Results Evidence of AD biomarker potential was available for imaging techniques reflecting amyloid burden and neurodegeneration. Several CSF measures are promising, including 42 amino acid ?-amyloid peptide (A?42); total tau (T-tau) protein, reflecting axonal damage; and phosphorylated tau (P-tau), reflecting neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Studies of plasma A? have produced inferior diagnostic discrimination. Alternative plasma and platelet measures are described, which represent potential avenues for future research. Conclusions Several imaging and CSF markers demonstrate utility in predicting AD progression and determining aetiology. These require standardisation before forming core elements of diagnostic criteria. The enormous potential available for identifying a minimally-invasive, easily-accessible blood measure as an effective AD biomarker currently remains unfulfilled.

AB  - Selenium is a component of selenoproteins with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), multiorgan dysfunction (MOD), and multiorgan failure (MOF) are associated with an early reduction in plasma selenium and glutathione peroxidase activity (GPx), and both parameters correlate inversely with the severity of illness and outcomes. Several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluated selenium therapy as monotherapy or in antioxidant cocktails in intensive care unit (ICU) patient populations, and more recently several meta-analyses suggested benefits with selenium therapy in the most seriously ill patients. However, the largest RCT on pharmaconutrition with glutamine and antioxidants, the REducing Deaths due to Oxidative Stress (REDOXS) Study, was unable to find any improvement in clinical outcomes with antioxidants provided by the enteral and parenteral route and suggested harm in patients with renal dysfunction. Subsequently, the MetaPlus study demonstrated increased mortality in medical patients when provided extra glutamine and selenium enterally. The treatment effect of selenium may be dependent on the dose, the route of administration, and whether administered with other nutrients and the patient population studied. Currently, there are few small studies evaluating the pharmacokinetic profile of intravenous (IV) selenium in SIRS, and therefore more data are necessary, particularly in patients with MOD, including those with renal dysfunction. According to current knowledge, high-dose pentahydrate sodium selenite could be given as an IV bolus injection (1000?2000 µg), which causes transient pro-oxidant, cytotoxic, and anti-inflammatory effects, and then followed by a continuous infusion of 1000?1600 µg/d for up to 10?14 days. Nonetheless, the optimum dose and efficacy still remain controversial and need to be definitively established.
