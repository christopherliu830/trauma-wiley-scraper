AB  - Summary In neurology, as in all specialties within medicine, accurate diagnosis of the cause of symptoms is seen as an essential prerequisite for rational management. For example, neuropathic pain of burning quality can occur in the limb of a patient with peripheral neuropathy, syringomyelia or a cerebral infarct. This chapter discusses the definitions, mechanisms of neuropathic pain, and assessment of pain in the patient with neurological disease. Most theories invoke either excitation of damaged sensory pathways, or diminution of inhibitory processes, or perhaps both. There are tracts in the dorsal and ventral segments of the spinal cord that mediate transmission of excitatory and inhibitory influences to and from the brain. Glomus tumour and osteoid asteoma deserve mention here because patients may present to neurology clinics, and because they can be cured by appropriate treatment. Some disorders referred to a neurologist appear to involve the interface between cutaneous and visceral innervations.

AB  - Perfusion of the mechanically compressed lumbar ganglion with lidocaine reduces mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia in the rat. (University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR) J Neurophysiol 2000;84:798?805. This study used an animal model of lumbar radiculopathy to investigate the neurological mechanisms of cutaneous hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia. The rat L5 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) was chronically compressed by inserting a hollow perforated rod into the intervertebral foramen. The DRG was constantly perfused through the hollow rod with either lidocaine or normal saline delivered by a subcutaneous osmotic pump. Behavioral evidence for neuropathic pain after DRG compression involved measuring the incidence of hindlimb withdrawals to both punctate indentations of the hind paw with mechanical probes exerting different bending forces and to light stroking of the hind paw with a cotton wisp. Behavioral results showed that for saline-treated control rats: the withdrawal thresholds for the ipsilateral and contralateral paws to mechanical stimuli decreased significantly after surgery and the incidence of foot withdrawal to light stroking significantly increased on both ipsilateral and contralateral hind paws. Local perfusion of the compressed DRG with 2% lidocaine for 7 days at a low flow-rate (1 ?l/h), or for 1 day at a high flow-rate (8 ?l/h) partially reduced the decrease in the withdrawal thresholds on the ipsilateral foot, but did not affect the contralateral foot. The incidence of foot withdrawal in response to light stroking with a cotton wisp decreased significantly on the ipsilateral foot and was completely abolished on the contralateral foot in the lidocaine treatment groups. Conclude that compression of the L5 DRG induced central pain syndrome that included bilateral mechanical hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia. Results also suggest that a lidocaine block, or a reduction in abnormal activity from the compressed ganglia to the spinal cord, could partially reduce mechanical hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia. Comments by Marshall Devor, PhD. Tonic compression of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in animal preparations, and presumably also in man, causes sensory cells to become electrically hyperexcitable. The resulting spontaneous discharge is a cause of ongoing paresthesias and pain. Many believe that in addition, this ectopic activity can trigger and maintain central sensitization in the spinal cord, resulting in tactile hypersensitivity (allodynia and hyperalgesia) in the body parts innervated by the ganglion. This second effect of ectopic DRG activity, however, is controversial. Zhang and collaborators now provide strong new support for this idea by showing that lidocaine infusion into the DRG, with consequent block of the ectopic DRG firing, considerably reduces allodynia and hyperalgesia for the duration of the infusion (weeks). Here is a novel therapeutic approach that deserves a try.

AB  - Effectiveness of sumatriptan in reducing productivity loss due to migraine: results of a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. (Center for Headache Management, Springfield, PA) Mayo Clin Proc 2000;75:782?789. This clinical trial determined the effect of sumatriptan on migraine-related workplace productivity loss. Adult migraine sufferers self-injected 6 mg of sumatriptan or matching placebo to treat a moderate or severe migraine within the first 4 h of a minimum of an 8-h work shift. Outcome measures included productivity loss and number of patients returning to normal work performance 2 h after injection and across the work shift, time to return to normal work performance, and time to headache relief. A total of 206 patients underwent screening, 140 (safety population) of whom returned for clinic treatment. Of these 140 patients, 119 received migraine treatment in the workplace. Sumatriptan treatment tended to reduce median productivity loss 2 h after injection compared with placebo (25.2 versus 29.9 min, respectively) (P = 0.14). Significant reductions in productivity loss were obtained across the work shift after sumatriptan treatment compared with placebo (36.8 versus 72.6, respectively) (P = 0.001). Significantly more sumatriptan-treated patients versus placebo-treated patients experienced shorter return to normal work performance at 2 h and across the work shift. Significantly more sumatriptan-treated patients experienced headache relief 1 h after injection compared with placebo-treated patients. Conclude that across an 8-h work shift, sumatriptan was superior to the placebo in reducing productivity loss due to migraine.

AB  - Neurotoxicity of intrathecally administered tetracaine commences at posterior roots near entry into the spinal cord. (Kitasato University, Kanagawa, Japan) Reg Anesth Pain Med 2000;25:372?379. This study examined the histopathologic effects of intrathecally administered tetracaine. Sixty Wistar rats randomly received either 20%, 10%, 5%, 3%, 1%, 0.5%, or 0% tetracaine dissolved in 10% glucose solution or no solution via a chronically implanted intrathecal catheter. The spinal cord at L1, posterior and anterior roots and cauda equina were excised 5 days later, sectioned, processed, and prepared for light and electron microscopic examinations. Rats treated with tetracaine at 10% or 20% developed lesions in the posterior white matter and posterior roots. Rats injected with 3% or 5% tetracaine developed lesions, which began in the posterior roots close to the spinal cord and extended to the posterior white matter. The lesions were characterized by axonal degeneration. Injections of 1% of tetracaine did not cause any pathological changes. The results suggest that the initial target of intrathecal tetracaine neurotoxicity may be the posterior roots at their entry into the spinal cord, where the axons are devoid of myelin sheath and thus represent a sensitive area for neurotoxic change. Comment by James E. Heavner, DVM, PhD. The reassuring aspect of this study is that no significant lesions were found when rats were given clinically used concentrations of tetracaine. The investigators do make a case that clinically used concentrations of tetracaine might be neurotoxic in humans based on the observation that the duration of action of tetracaine is shorter in rats than in humans. The distribution of the lesions is curious in that 10% tetracaine produced lesions in the posterior rootlets and in the posterior rootlet entry zone, but did not produce lesions in the fasciculus gracilis. The implication is that rootlets posterior to lamina L1 (the L1 segment that was examined) that were destroyed do not project into the fasciculus gracilis. One would expect that destruction of lamina L2 posterior rootlets that projected into the fasciculus gracilis would produce lesions visible at the EM level at L1 5 days after damage. The absence of lesions in the L1 fasciculus gracilis puzzles me. I am also puzzled by the suggestion that all posterior rootlets loose their myelin sheath just before entry into the posterior white matter of the spinal cord (Obersteiner-Redlich zone). To my knowledge, most posterior rootlets do not have this nonmyelinated zone and; therefore, the absence of the myelin would make only a portion of the posterior rootlets vulnerable to tetracaine neurotoxicity as suggested by the authors. In short, there are some anatomical relationships that do not fit with the distribution of lesions described by the investigators.

AB  - Treatment of postherpetic neuralgia: an update. (University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY) Drugs 2000;59:1113?1126. This article provided an update on recent developments in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). In clinical trials, the topical lidocaine patch, gabapentin, and controlled release oxycodone have been shown to provide superior pain relief in patients with PHN when compared with placebo. It has also been demonstrated that the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline provides equivalent analgesic benefit when compared with amitriptyline, but is better tolerated. Based on these results, nortriptyline can now be considered the preferred antidepressant for treatment of PHN. The topical lidocaine patch, gabapentin, and controlled release oxycodone all appear to be as effective as tricycline antidepressants in the treatment of patients with PHN, and the results of these recent studies suggest that each of these treatments should be considered early in the course of treatment. Additional controlled trials are needed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of these 4 treatments for patients with PHN.
