AB  - Introduction:? Diabetes is known to impair wound healing. We assessed the effect of aging on this impairment and further explored the possibility of repairing age-dependant impairment by replenishing levels of the growth factor KGF-1 using our system of electroporation enhanced gene therapy. Methods:? Female BKS.Cg-m+/+Leprdb/J mice (diabetic) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice at time of study were 7, 27, and 84 weeks, respectively. Two wounds were created using a 5?mm punch biopsy. Plasmid DNA encoding KGF-1 was injected at 40??g / wound. Electroporation was carried out with six square wave pulses, at 1800 volts for 100??s; with aninterval of 125?ms. Wounds were assessed planometrically over a 14-day period. Results:? We found that wound healing is severely impaired in older, but not young diabetic mice (7-week-old mice displayed a threefold smaller wound area than 84-week-old mice on day 9). Glucose levels were similar in old and young groups ruling out differences in intensity of the metabolic derangement to explain this disparity (old: 334 +/? 41?mg/dl vs. young: 290 +/? 33?mg/dl). Treatment with KGF-1 gene therapy increased wound closure in aged mice 5.9-fold as compared to untreated aged mice 5 days after wounding (treated: 3724 +/? 631 vs. untreated: 632 +/? 517, P?=?0.002). Aged KGF-1 gene therapy-treated mice closed wounds 10-fold faster than treated young mice 5 days after wounding (old: 3724: +/? 631 vs. young 358 +/? 871, P?=?0.004). Conclusions:? We conclude that progressive damage to the tissues capability to heal occurs in individuals with diabetes. Treatment with KGF-1 gene therapy is more effective in aged mice than young mice. With an increasing geriatric diabetic population, gene therapy to replenish growth factors may be worth exploring.

AB  - This study examined adult hospitalized patients? responses to wound care pain and its treatment. Wound care included dressing change, packing, irrigation, and debridement. The subjective experience of pain intensity was measured with a numeric rating scale (NRS) prior to, immediately after, and 10 minutes after completion of the procedure. The sample was composed of 412 subjects. Most were male (52.3%), white (73.9%), had one wound (59.5%), and had undergone surgery (73.9%). When pain intensity was compared over time, pain intensity was greatest (NRS 4.4, SD 3.2) during the procedure (p?<?.023), and nonsurgical patients experienced significantly greater pain than surgical patients (p?=?.002)(NRS 5.3, SD 3.0, NRS 4.1, SD3.2, respectively). Most patients underwent multiple wound care procedures. When the pain intensity of undergoing only a dressing change (n?=?61), only packing (n?=?41), or ≥2 procedures (n?=?258) was examined by whether subjects had undergone surgery or no surgery, nonsurgical patients reported greater pain intensity with dressing change (p?<?.001) and ≥2 procedures (p?<?.001). Few subjects received analgesics (7.3% surgical patients 5.9% nonsurgical); there was no difference by group in the amount of opioid administered (p?=?.821). Sedatives and NSAIDS were rarely used. Treatment with pain medication was examined over time. Those with least pain received significantly less pain medication when compared with those who received premedication only and those who received medication prior to and during the procedure (p?<?.05). Findings show wound care is painful and wound care pain is undertreated. Further research is needed to address the effect of pain on wound-related patient outcomes and strategies to minimize pain.

AB  - Intertester reliability of the McKenzie evaluation in assessing patients with mechanical low back pain. (Sunny Brook 30:368?389. In this study, patients were assessed simultaneously by 2 physical therapists trained in the McKenzie evaluation system. The therapists were randomly assigned as examiner and observer. Agreement was estimated by Kappa statistics. Forty-five subjects (47 ± 14 years), composed of 25 women and 20 men with acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain were examined. The agreement between raters for selection of the McKenzie syndromes was K = 0.70, and for the derangement subsyndromes was K = 0.96. Interrater agreement for the presence of lateral shift, relevance of lateral shift, relevance of lateral component, and deformity in the sagittal plane was K = 0.52, 0.85, 0.95, and 1.00, respectively. Intertester agreement on syndrome categories in 17 patients under 55 years of age was excellent with K = 1.00. Conclude that a form of low back evaluation, using patterns of pain response to repeated end range spinal test movements, was highly reliable when performed by 2 properly trained physical therapists. Comment by Karen Crawford, RPT. This article intends to address the ability for therapists to agree on a low back pain diagnosis using the McKenzie technique of classification. It is important for this study to select a clear clinical diagnosis in order to establish rationale for patient management and determine a prognosis. Another purpose for this study was to agree on the relevance of sagittal and frontal plane deformities using McKenzie methods in assessing patients with back pain. The subjects included adult patients with a history of acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain. Patients were referred by general practitioners or specialists for treatment at an outpatient department where the study was conducted. The examination consisted of taking a history, observational evaluation of the range of motion, and completion of a specified tests movements in the sagittal, frontal, and combined planes. Subjects were allowed to communicate only with the assessor. A total of 46 patients with a history of low back pain agreed to complete the assessment. Patients were divided into 2 groups, those 55 years of age and older and those younger than 55. McKenzie identifies only 3 mechanical syndromes: 1. Postural, 2. Dysfunction, 3. Derangement. Each of these syndromes were divided into separate subsyndromes according to location of the pain and presence or absence of spinal deformities. The study concluded that therapists trained in use of the McKenzie evaluation system can be highly reliable in reaching the same conclusion in respect to classifying patients into diagnostic syndromes and subsyndromes, especially in patients under the age of 55. In contrast to other published studies, the importance of advanced training for interpretation of symptom behavior definitely leads to selection of the correct diagnosis.

AB  - Summary Background Understanding of the role of vitamin D in health and disease has increased markedly in the past decade, with its involvement extending well beyond traditional roles in calcium and phosphate homeostasis and musculoskeletal health. This conceptual expansion has been underpinned by identification and exploration of components of this axis including vitamin D-binding protein, key enzymes and receptors in multiple cell types, and a greater recognition of nonclassical autocrine and paracrine effects. Its influence in IBD remains uncertain. Aim To review the role of vitamin D in bone health, immune regulation and cancer prevention in IBD, and to outline practical issues and limitations of its use. Methods An extensive online literature review including PubMed and Medline. Results In patients with IBD, the vitamin D axis provides an important and often underutilised pathway to preserving bone health. Furthermore, an exciting body of clinical and basic science research demonstrates that these pathways may have an integral part to play in regulation of the immune response in IBD, through effects on the intestinal barrier, antigen presenting cells and adaptive T cells. The possibility of chemoprevention requires further study. The optimal target level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in patients with IBD is currently uncertain, as is the best therapeutic modality. Conclusions Study of vitamin D pathways may result in the development of relatively inexpensive therapeutic options to optimise patient outcomes. Further prospective clinical research is required to address efficacy and long-term safety.
