AB  - Introduction:? Using peptide growth factors to improve upon natural wound healing provides promise, but topical application of growth factors has found limited clinical success. Gene therapy has been limited by low transfection efficiency. We are investigating the use of electroporation (EP)in vivo to enhance transfection efficiency and improve wound healing with DNA expression vectors for growth factors. Methods:? To assess plasmid transfection and wound healing, gWIZ luciferase vector and PCDNA3.1/KGF expression vector were used, respectively. Cutaneous wounds were produced via 8?mm-punch biopsy in Sprague Dawley rats. Healing was impaired by cecal ligation induced sepsis. We used NIH image analysis software and histologic assessment to assess wound closure. Results:? Plasmid Transfection: EP effectively increased expression of gWIZ luciferase vector 53-fold compared to vector without EP (p?<?0.001). We demonstrated that transfection was localized to skin when transfected skin was reflected to reveal underlying muscle. We found that EP-assisted transfection lasted for 30 days, which is appropriate for treatment of wound healing. Wound Healing:? Using PCDNA3.1/KGF expression vector and EP wounds were 60% smaller on day 12 versus vector without EP (p?<?0.009). We assessed quality of healing with a histologic scoring system grading quality of epithelial coverage, organization of scar and resolution of inflammation. KGF vector?+?EP score of 3.0 +/? 0.3 was better than that of 1.8 +/? 0.3 for treatment with vector alone (p?<?0.05). Conclusions:? These results demonstrate the capacity of electroporation-facilitated transfection with DNA plasmid expression vector for growth factor to improve wound healing. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Abstract Background Despite evidence that CNS treatment is associated with cognitive and academic impairment, interventions to prevent or mitigate these problems are limited. The purpose was to determine if early intervention can prevent declines in mathematics abilities. Procedures Fifty-seven children with ALL were enrolled and randomized to a Mathematics Intervention or Standard Care. Subjects completed neurocognitive assessments prior to the intervention, post-intervention, and 1 year later. Parents received written results and recommendations for use with their school. The Mathematics Intervention was based on Multiple Representation Theory and delivered individually over 1 year. Results Thirty-two of 57 subjects completed the study and were included in data analyses. These 32 subjects completed all neurocognitive assessments and, for those in the Intervention Group, 40?50?hours of the Mathematics Intervention. There were no group differences on relevant demographic variables; risk stratification; number of intrathecal methotrexate injections; or high dose systemic methotrexate. Significant improvements in calculation and applied mathematics from Baseline to Post-Intervention (P?=?0.003 and 0.002, respectively) and in visual working memory from Baseline to 1 year Follow-up (P?=?0.02) were observed in the Intervention but not the Standard Care Group. Results from repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated significant between group differences for applied mathematics [F(2,29)?=?12.47, P?<?0.001] and visual working memory [F(2,29)?=?5.53, P?=?0.009]. Conclusions The Mathematics Intervention improved mathematics abilities and visual working memory compared to standard care. Future studies are needed to translate the Mathematics Intervention into a ?virtual? delivery method more readily available to parents and children.

AB  - Prospects for the prevention of postherpetic neuralgia in herpes zoster patients. (University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY) Clin J Pain 2000;16:S90?100. This review discussed the results of recent studies that have identified risk factors for the development of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and have implicated several peripheral and central mechanisms in its pathophysiology. These risk factors and mechanisms of PHN provide a basis for hypothesizing that combining antiviral therapy with analgesic treatment beginning as soon as possible after the onset of herpes zoster would reduce the risk of PHN beyond that achieved by antiviral therapy alone. Conclude this treatment approach would be expected to reduce the risk of PHN in herpes zoster patients by attenuating acute pain and thereby preventing the initiation of central mechanisms of chronic pain.

AB  - Regional pain syndrome: a distinct clinical entity associated with HLA-DR13. (Leiden University Medical center. Leiden, The Netherlands) Ann Neurol 2000;48:113?116. This report discussed 26 patients with a distinct phenotype of complex regional pain syndrome that progressed toward a multifocal or generalized tonic dystonia. The dystonia initiated distally, involved mainly flexor muscles, and was associated with sensory and autonomic symptoms. Dryness of the eyes or mouth and bladder and bowel disturbances were frequently reported. There was no increase in the familial prevalence of autoimmune-mediated disease. Compared with controls, a significant elevation of HLA-DR13 was found in the patients. Thus, HLA-DR13 may be a factor indicating susceptibility to this distinct phenotype of complex regional pain syndrome.

AB  - Abstract The development of microfluidic methodology that can be used in conjunction with drug screening and biomolecular diagnostics offers a route to evidence-based personalized medical care. Ideally, all personal diagnostics are best carried out in a rapid and frequent manner and a microfluidic interface can provide appropriate methodology. The ability to perform genetic analysis or biomarker detection at point-of-care would allow the clinician to decide on the most informed course of treatment. Microfluidic systems for biomolecular analysis at all levels, from genes to whole tissue biopsies, have been proposed. Much of the work presented here is at an early stage of development but will consider the range of design considerations together with the plethora of potential applications of integrated microfluidic technology.
