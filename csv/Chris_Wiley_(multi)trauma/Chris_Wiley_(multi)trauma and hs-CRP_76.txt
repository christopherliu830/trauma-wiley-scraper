AB  - Purpose of the study:? To investigate the transfer of rac-tramadol and its rac-O-desmethyl metabolite into transitional milk, to estimate the absolute and relative infant doses via milk, and to assess unwanted effects in the breastfed infant. Methods:? Tramadol HCl (100?mg six hourly) was administered to 75 breastfeeding mothers for postoperative analgesia on days 2?4 after caesarian section. Three samples of transitional milk and one of plasma were collected over 6?14 h following the 4th dose. Tramadol and O-desmethyltramadol were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Milk/plasma ratio (M/P) was calculated, and absolute infant dose and relative infant dose were calculated by standard methods. The behavioral characteristics of the exposed breastfed infants and a matched control group of infants not exposed to tramadol were also studied. Results:? Mean (95% CI) M/P was 2.2 (2.0?2.4) for tramadol and 2.8 (2.5?3.1) for O-desmethyltramadol. Average concentrations in milk across a 6 h dose interval at steady-state were 748 (681?815) mcg l?1 for tramadol and 203 (188?217) mcg l?1for O-desmethyltramadol. Estimated absolute and relative infant doses were 112 (102?122) mcg?kg?1 day?1 and 30 (28?32) mcg?kg?1 day?1, and 2.24 (2.04?2.44)% and 0.64 (0.59?0.69)% for tramadol and O-desmethyltramadol respectively. The exposed infants and control breastfed infants had similar characteristics, including Apgar scores at birth and Neurologic and Adaptive Capacity Scores (NACS) on days 3?4 after birth. Conclusions:? The absolute infant doses for tramadol and its active metabolite combined were around 14% of the child therapeutic dose for tramadol. The combined relative infant dose of 2.88% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose was also low. The similarity of NACS in exposed infants and controls suggests that there were no clinically significant effects on infant well-being. We conclude that short-term maternal use of tramadol during establishment of lactation is safe for the breastfed infant.

AB  - Background: Various inflammatory mediators have been identified as potential contributors to complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS1), but these mediators do not entirely explain certain manifestations of the syndrome, such as pain. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of amino acids in the pathogenesis of CRPS1. Methods: We used HPLC to determine plasma concentrations of 16 amino acids, especially those related to the NMDA receptor (e.g., glutamate and glycine) and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis (e.g., arginine and citrulline) in patients with CRPS1 (n=64) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n=51). Patients rated pain intensity (visual analog scale) and the subjective experience of pain intensity (McGill Pain Questionnaire). Psychological dysfunction was assessed using the SCL-90. Results: Relative to controls, in CRPS1 patients, plasma levels of glutamate, arginine, taurine, and glycine were increased, and plasma levels of glutamine and the ratio of citrulline to arginine were decreased. Remarkably, in CRPS1 patients there was a highly significant inverse correlation between glutamine and glutamate, although the sum of molar concentrations of glutamate and glutamine remains unchanged. Subjective measures of pain and indicators of psychoneuroticism and emotional instability did not correlate with amino acid levels. Conclusion: This study shows for the first time a pronounced increase in amino acid levels in this chronic pain syndrome. The marked differences in glutamate, glutamine, glycine, taurine and arginine levels between patients and controls suggest the involvement of both the NDMA receptor and the endothelium-dependent arginine-NO system in CRPS1.

AB  - Objectives To describe the demography, clinical characteristics, treatment, functional limitations and outcomes of patients referred to a paediatric multidisciplinary pain clinic. Design Prospective data collection, descriptive study. Patients and setting Tertiary referral centre pain clinic (Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne) over two years (March 1998 ? March 2000). Main outcome measures Pain profile; functional disability (school absenteeism, sleep disturbance and inability to perform sport); treatments received; outcome. Results 207 patients (mean age, 13.1 years; 73% females; 29% rural residents) were referred in the two years. Concomitant medical conditions were present in 106/207 (51%) patients, the commonest being cerebral palsy or spasticity (22 patients) and malignancy (18). Complex regional pain syndrome was diagnosed in 44 patients. Functional disability due to pain included school absenteeism (95% of school attenders), sleep disruption (71% of all patients) and inability to perform sport (90% of those able to participate in sport previously). Of the 105 patients who missed five or more days of school because of pain, 93 attended school regularly after treatment. Sleep disturbance improved in 129/146 (88%) patients, and 129/147 (88%) resumed sporting activity after multidisciplinary intervention. Outcome was classified as good in 134 patients (65%), moderate in 32 (15%) and poor in 16 (8%). Conclusions Chronic pain in children and adolescents often results in considerable functional disability. Functional improvement can be achieved using a multidisciplinary approach to pain management in children.

AB  - Abstract Background Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) comprise a large and heterogeneous group of infections including bacterial, viral and other aetiologies. In recent years, procalcitonin - the prohormone of calcitonin - has emerged as a promising marker for the diagnosis of bacterial infections and for improving decisions about antibiotic therapy. Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the feasibility of using procalcitonin for starting and stopping antibiotics in different patient populations with acute respiratory infections and different settings ranging from primary care to emergency departments (EDs), hospital wards and intensive care units (ICUs). Objectives The aim of this systematic review based on individual patient data was to assess the safety and efficacy of using procalcitonin for starting or stopping antibiotics over a large range of patients with varying severity of ARIs and from different clinical settings. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2011, Issue 2) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to May 2011) and EMBASE (1974 to May 2011) to identify suitable trials. Selection criteria We included RCTs of adult participants with ARIs who received an antibiotic treatment either based on a procalcitonin algorithm or usual care/guidelines. Trials were excluded if they exclusively focused on paediatric patients or if they used procalcitonin for another purpose than to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment. Data collection and analysis Two teams of review authors independently evaluated the methodology and extracted data from primary studies. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and treatment failure at 30 days. For the primary care setting, treatment failure was defined as death, hospitalisation, ARI-specific complications, recurrent or worsening infection, and patients reporting any symptoms of an ongoing respiratory infection at follow-up. For the ED setting, treatment failure was defined as death, ICU admission, re-hospitalisation after index hospital discharge, ARI-associated complications, and recurrent or worsening infection within 30 days of follow-up. For the ICU setting, treatment failure was defined as death within 30 days of follow-up. Secondary endpoints were antibiotic use (initiation of antibiotics, duration of antibiotics and total exposure to antibiotics (total amount of antibiotic days divided by total number of patients)), length of hospital stay for hospitalised patients, length of ICU stay for critically ill patients, and number of days with restricted activities within 14 days after randomisation for primary care patients. For the two co-primary endpoints of all-cause mortality and treatment failure, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariable hierarchical logistic regression. The hierarchical regression model was adjusted for age and clinical diagnosis as fixed-effect. The different trials were added as random-effects into the model. We fitted corresponding linear regression models for antibiotic use. We conducted sensitivity analyses stratified by clinical setting and ARI diagnosis to assess the consistency of our results. Main results We included 14 trials with 4221 participants. There were 118 deaths in 2085 patients (5.7%) assigned to procalcitonin groups compared to 134 deaths in 2126 control patients (6.3%) (adjusted OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.23). Treatment failure occurred in 398 procalcitonin group patients (19.1%) and in 466 control patients (21.9%). Procalcitonin guidance was not associated with increased mortality or treatment failure in any clinical setting, or ARI diagnosis. These results proved robust in various sensitivity analyses. Total antibiotic exposure was significantly reduced overall (median (interquartile range) from 8 (5 to 12) to 4 (0 to 8) days; adjusted difference in days, -3.47, 95% CI -3.78 to -3.17, and across all the different clinical settings and diagnoses. Authors' conclusions Use of procalcitonin to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with ARI was not associated with higher mortality rates or treatment failure. Antibiotic consumption was significantly reduced across different clinical settings and ARI diagnoses. Further high-quality research is needed to confirm the safety of this approach for non-European countries and patients in intensive care. Moreover, future studies should also establish cost-effectiveness by considering country-specific costs of procalcitonin measurement and potential savings in consumption of antibiotics and other healthcare resources, as well as secondary cost savings due to lower risk of side effects and reduced antimicrobial resistance. Procalcitonin testing to initiate or discontinue antibiotics in acute respiratory tract infections Unnecessary antibiotic use significantly contributes to increasing bacterial resistance, medical costs and the risk of drug-related adverse events. The blood marker procalcitonin increases in bacterial infections and decreases when patients recover from the infection. Hence, procalcitonin may be used to support clinical decision making for the initiation and discontinuation of antibiotic therapy in patients with a clinical suspicion of infection. Randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that such a strategy works, particularly in patients with an infection of the respiratory tract. However, most of these individual studies did not include enough patients to allow for a conclusive assessment about safety (low statistical power). Thus, the risk for mortality and severe complications associated with procalcitonin-guided decision making remained unclear. This systematic review included individual patient data from 14 randomised controlled trials with a total of 4211 participants. When looking at these combined data, we found no increased risk for all-cause mortality or treatment failure when procalcitonin was used to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic treatment in participants with acute respiratory infections compared to control participants. However, we found a consistent reduction of antibiotic use, mainly due to lower prescription rates in primary care and lower duration of antibiotic courses in emergency department and intensive care unit patients. This analysis is limited to adult patients with respiratory infections excluding patients who were immuno-compromised (i.e. HIV positive, those receiving immuno-suppressive therapies or chemotherapy). Most trials were conducted in Europe and China and similar studies in other countries including the United States are warranted.
