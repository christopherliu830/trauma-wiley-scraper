AB  - Summary The evidence base for diagnosis and management of musculoskeletal infections has become stronger in the last years with publication of a substantial number of new articles. This chapter covers three of the most important entities of musculoskeletal infection: septic arthritis, prosthetic joint infection (PJI), and osteomyelitis. It presents background, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes of septic arthritis, PJI and osteomyelitis. The chapter also presents some case examples. In native joints, septic arthritis is most commonly caused by hematogenous seeding of microorganisms from a distant infection focus. PJI represents an important complication, associated with high morbidity, need for complex treatment and substantial healthcare costs. Osteitis describes infection affecting only cortical bone; osteomyelitis implies that the cortex and medulla are involved. Osteomyelitis is classified by the route of infection. In contrast to acute osteomyelitis, chronic osteomyelitis and osteosynthesis-associated infections are unlikely to be eradicated without surgical treatment.

AB  - Influence of tramadol on the ventilatory response to hypoxia in humans. (University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom) Br J Anaesth 2000;85:211?216. In this study, the effect of tramadol on the ventilatory response to 7 min acute isocapnic hypoxia during steady mild hypercapnia in 14 healthy volunteers (7 male, 7 female) was studied. The acute hypoxic response was measured before and 1 h after oral placebo or tramadol (100 mg). After tramadol, ventilation during mild hypercapnia (mean 11.28 liters min?1) was significantly less (P < 0.05) than during placebo baseline (13.93 liters min?1), tramadol baseline (14.63 liters min?1), or after placebo (14.9 liters min?1), confirming that tramadol has a small depressive effect on the hypercapnic ventilatory response. There was no significant difference in the hypoxic ventilation/Spo2 response measured during the placebo baseline (0.99), placebo (1.18), tramadol baseline (0.78) or tramadol (0.68) runs. These data suggest that tramadol does not depress the hypoxic ventilatory response.

AB  - Abstract Background Authors were assigned the task to develop case definitions for periodontitis in the context of the 2017 World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions. The aim of this manuscript is to review evidence and rationale for a revision of the current classification, to provide a framework for case definition that fully implicates state-of-the-art knowledge and can be adapted as new evidence emerges, and to suggest a case definition system that can be implemented in clinical practice, research and epidemiologic surveillance. Methods Evidence gathered in four commissioned reviews was analyzed and interpreted with special emphasis to changes with regards to the understanding available prior to the 1999 classification. Authors analyzed case definition systems employed for a variety of chronic diseases and identified key criteria for a classification/case definition of periodontitis. Results The manuscript discusses the merits of a periodontitis case definition system based on Staging and Grading and proposes a case definition framework. Stage I to IV of periodontitis is defined based on severity (primarily periodontal breakdown with reference to root length and periodontitis-associated tooth loss), complexity of management (pocket depth, infrabony defects, furcation involvement, tooth hypermobility, masticatory dysfunction) and additionally described as extent (localized or generalized). Grade of periodontitis is estimated with direct or indirect evidence of progression rate in three categories: slow, moderate and rapid progression (Grade A-C). Risk factor analysis is used as grade modifier. Conclusions The paper describes a simple matrix based on stage and grade to appropriately define periodontitis in an individual patient. The proposed case definition extends beyond description based on severity to include characterization of biological features of the disease and represents a first step towards adoption of precision medicine concepts to the management of periodontitis. It also provides the necessary framework for introduction of biomarkers in diagnosis and prognosis.

AB  - Phantom pain and phantom sensations in upper limb amputees: an epidemiological study. (University Hospital Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands) Pain 2000;87:33?41. This study determined the prevalence and factors associated with phantom pain and phantom sensations in upper limb amputees in The Netherlands. Additionally, the relationship between phantom pain, phantom sensations, and prosthesis use in upper limb amputees was investigated. One hundred twenty-four upper limb amputees participated in the study. Subjects were asked to fill out a self-developed questionnaire scoring the following items: date, side, level, and reason of amputation, duration of experienced pain before amputation, frequencies with which phantom sensations, phantom pain, and stump pain are experienced, amount of trouble and suffering experienced, respectively, related to these sensations, type of phantom sensations, medical treatment received for phantom pain and/or stump pain, and the effects of the treatment, self medication, and prosthesis use. The response rate was 80%. The prevalence of phantom pain was 51%, of phantom sensations 76%, and of stump pain 49%; 48% of the subjects experienced phantom pain a few times per day or more. Moderate to severe suffering from phantom pain was experienced by 64% of the respondents. A significant association was found between phantom pain and phantom sensations (relative risk 11.3) and between phantom pain and stump pain (relative risk 1.9). No other factors associated with phantom pain or phantom sensations could be determined. Only 4 patients received medical treatment for their phantom pain. Phantom pain is a common problem in upper limb amputees that causes considerable suffering for the subjects involved. Only a small number of subjects are treated for phantom pain. Conclude that further research is needed to determine factors associated with phantom pain.

AB  - Potent analgesic effects of GDNF in neuropathic pain states. (King's College London, London, United Kingdom) Science 2000;290:124?127. Neuropathic pain arises as a debilitating consequence of nerve injury. The etiology of such pain is poorly understood, and existing treatment is largely ineffective. We demonstrate here that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) both prevented and reversed sensory abnormalities that developed in neuropathic pain models, without affecting pain-related behavior in normal animals. GDNF reduces ectopic discharges within sensory neurons after nerve injury. This may arise as a consequence of the reversal by GDNF of the injury-induced plasticity of several sodium channel subunits. Together these findings provide a rational basis for the use of GDNF as a therapeutic treatment for neuropathic pain states. Comment by Marshall Devor, PhD. Nerve injury frequently causes sensory neurons to become electrically hyperexcitable. The resulting ectopic afferent firing is thought to be the immediate cause of ongoing pain, movement-evoked pain, and allodynia in neuropathic pain states. But why do the neurons become hyperexcitable? A popular hypothesis has it that when the axon is cut, the sensory cell body in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) is starved of essential neurotrophic molecules that are normally produced in the periphery and transported to the DRG via axoplasmic transport. If so, then providing an exogenous source of the critical neurotrophin should prevent, or even reverse, the hyperexcitability and the pain. Boucher et al tried this, administering 1 of 3 candidate neurotrophins (NGF, NT-3, or GDNF) by the intrathecal (i.t.) route. One of them, GDNF, worked dramatically. The authors believe that i.t. GDNF acts by diffusing into the DRG (rather than the spinal cord) where it alters the expression of the channel proteins that are responsible for electrical hyperexcitability.

AB  - Abstract Perinatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) is the most common cause of various neurological disabilities in children with high societal cost. Hypoxic-ischemic brain damage is an evolving process and ample evidence suggests distinct difference between the immature and mature brain in the pathology and consequences of brain injury. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to better understand the mechanisms underlying the hypoxic-ischemic injury in neonatal brain to devise effective therapeutic strategies. Nonetheless, the mechanism(s) involved in this pathology in the developing brain remain inadequately understood. Effective neuroprotective strategies will include either inhibition of the death effector pathways or induction of their regulatory and survival promoting cellular proteins. Neuronal pentraxins (NPs) define a family of novel proteins ?long pentraxins? that are exclusively expressed in the central neurons, and are homologous to the C-reactive and acute-phase proteins in the immune system. NPs have been shown to be involved in the excitatory synaptic remodeling. We found that the neuronal protein ?neuronal pentraxin 1? (NP1) is induced in neonatal rat brain following HI, and NP1 induction preceded the time of actual tissue loss in brain. In demonstrating this we also found that NP1 gene silencing is neuroprotective against hypoxia-induced neuronal death. This is the first evidence for a pathophysiological function of NP1 in central neurons. Our results suggest that NP1 is part of a death program triggered by HI. Most importantly, our findings of specific interactions of NP1 with the excitatory glutamate receptors AMPA GluR1 subunit and their co-localization suggest a role for this novel neuronal protein NP1 in the excitotoxic cascade. Blockade of AMPA-induced neuronal death following inhibition of NP1 expression further implicates a regulatory interaction between NP1 and AMPA glutamate receptors. Subsequent experiments using NP1 loss-of-function strategies, we have demonstrated specific requirements of NP1 induction in HI-induced neuronal death. Together our findings clearly identify a novel role for NP1 in the coupling between HI and cerebral cell death. Thus, NP1 could be a new molecular target in the central neurons for preventing hypoxic-ischemic neuronal death in developing brain. These very novel results could lead to more effective neuroprotective strategies against hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in neonates.
