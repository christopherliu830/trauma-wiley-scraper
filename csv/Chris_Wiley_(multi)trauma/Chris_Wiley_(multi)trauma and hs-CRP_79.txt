AB  - Background:? Preclinical animal studies with a fetal bovine dermal collagen matrix suggest that fibroblasts quickly populate the material. At the same time there is a rapid ingrowth of new blood vessels. In short, the matrix quickly becomes living tissue. Experience with bioengineered skin constructs and porcine small intestinal submucosal products suggest that the application of a scaffold or matrix may play a role in the healing of venous leg ulcerations in humans. Methods:? A fetal bovine dermal collagen matrix (Primatrix) was applied to patients with long-standing venous leg ulcerations. Histologic examination pre and post application with trichrome staining was employed to differentiate matrix from native collagen. Comparisons between animal and human ulcers were made grossly and histologically. Results:? In all patients there was rapid formation of granulation tissue with a decrease in the depth of the wound. This was followed by epithelialization and wound closure. The stimulatory effect persisted for approximately 1 month after which time a second matrix was applied. In contrast to the animal study the grafts exhibited ?take? in only one of our patients. Histologic examination in both animals and humans suggests a stimulation of native collagen production as well as an initial incorporation of the Primatrix into the wound bed. Conclusion:? Primatrix has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical studies and in a series of patients with venous leg ulcerations. The product may function as a scaffold for the ingrowth of cells essential to wound healing. Further investigation in a randomized controlled study setting is recommended. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - The treatment of venous ulcers must start with compression and if the ankle brachial index is greater than 0.8 high compression bandages can be applied. Despite edema control, there are a number of venous ulcers that do not heal at the expected rate. Patients with venous ulcers of greater than 4 weeks duration were treated with a prolonged release absorptive nanocrystalline silver dressing (Acticoat 7) under the 4 layer bandage, Profore for 12 weeks, or until healing. Biopsies were obtained from the ulcer base at week 0 for histology and bacterial burden. Duplicate biopsies for quantitative bacteriology were performed with one submitted whole and the second bisected into superficial and deep components. The paired biopsies were then repeated after a median of 6.5 weeks (range 2 to 12 weeks). The histological specimens were examined by the histopathologist (SR). Inflammatory infiltrates were identified in the superficial, middle and deep segments of the biopsies. Acute infiltrates were identified through the concentration of neutrophils and chronic infiltrates by the presence of lymphocytes. Each biopsy and each segment was graded for infiltrates on a four point semi quantitative score. A total of 15 patients (9 male, and 6 female) were enrolled into the study. The median age was 63 years (range 30?83 years). The median duration of current ulceration was 17.3 weeks (range 4 weeks to 11 years) and the median ulcer area was 4.8?cm2(range 1.8?43.9?cm2). The median exposure to Acticoat 7 was 82 days (range 8?86 days). There were 12 sets of paired biopsies that were analyzed. There was a statistically significant reduction (p?=?0.0114) in the log10(total bacterial count) between the baseline and final biopsies (median 4.48 and 3.00, respectively). Four patients healed, 8 patients continued to the end of the 12-week study period and three patients were discontinued early. For all patients, the median percentage reduction in ulcer area was 94.4% and the median final ulcer area was 0.4?cm2. Analysis of the histology and bacteriology data demonstrated that the presence of a high neutrophilic infiltrate in skin biopsies was associated with high bacterial counts (superficial compartment of the quantitative biopsies) at week 4 and delayed healing (p?=?0.037). In the week 0 biopsy, increased lymphocytic infiltrates within the superficial and middle segments were associated with accelerated healing in the first 4 weeks (p?=?0.26 and 0.09). The nanocrystalline silver dressing has demonstrated an anti-bacterial and permissive but selective anti-inflammatory action allowing lymphocytic infiltrates to increase associated with an accelerated reduction in ulcer size.

AB  - The paradigms of surgical wound closure are direct repair, grafts, and flaps. The core subject of plastic surgery, these distinct modalities are a sophisticated art that can reliably close any healthy wound. The caveat is that ordinary surgery implicitly depends on competent wound healing. With pathological wounds, those due to vascular, hematological, immunopathic, and other ulcerogenic diseases, these modalities may not work. The operation is threatened if wound healing is retarded, and incisions and donor sites are subject to morbidity from active disease. Disease and risks may limit potential donor tissues, sustain inflammation and lysis, restrict circulation, or make the patient too ill for elaborate procedures. Integra? collagen-chondroitin matrix has ideal properties for managing chronic pathological wounds: a high-grade artificial skin; survives disease and conditions where grafts die; performs the coverage duties of flaps without donor sites; minimizes nursing care; suppresses inflammation, wound healing, and scar; induces embryonic dermatogenesis. Risk free to the recipient, it is safe where disease and altered anatomy make conventional closure impossible or unsafe. Its indications, use, results, and conceptual basis make it a distinct fourth paradigm of surgical wound closure: in situ tissue engineering. Understanding when a flap should but cannot be used is to understand when Integra should be used. Study:? Using a consistent set of indications and management scheme, Integra was used for chronic pathological wounds in 111 patients (158 individual ulcers, 166 instances of exposed anatomical structures, diverse diagnoses). Success rate was 92% of patients healed; 90% of open structures healed. Inpatient services were nearly eliminated. Integra is not an alternative to conventional repair, grafts, and flaps. As a method of tissue engineering, it is a new and equal paradigm of care with its own indications and contraindications, and a superior safety and success profile. Repair, grafts, and flaps, which require wound healing competency, are best suited for healthy and acute wounds. For many chronic and pathological wounds, in situ matrix-guided histogenesis is the best method, and surgeons must begin working this into their practices.

AB  - Bacterial growth within extended use wound dressings remains a problem. We have developed a superabsorbent, microbicidal dressing based on the permanent attachment of a cationic polymer (the quaternary ammonium compound diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, DADMAC) onto a range of physical substrates. Treated gauze (Sof-Wick?) absorbed 50x its weight in saline and reduced bacterial, viral and fungal growth by six logs in vitro (AATCC method 100), with no zone of inhibition or extractables, as shown in Figure 1 below. Bacterial kill occurs within minutes, and remains effective in 10% serum. Good hemostatic properties were demonstrated for treated gauze wound dressing using both a rat liver laceration model, and a renal artery transection model, showing equivalent efficacy to approved haemorrhage control dressings (Avitene, Surgicel, and Gel Foam) that do not claim microbicidal activity. Treated gauze passed cytotoxicity testing using rabbit eye and skin tests, as well as guinea pig dermal sensitization tests. 1 Gauze sponges inoculated with E. Coli and stained for bacterial presence. Left is control; right is NIMBUS treated. Note no zone of inhibition around treated gauze. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Sepsis remains the single most important cause for multiple organ failure and death following burn injury for which no effective treatment is currently available. Burn injury is associated with immunosuppression which promotes sepsis. Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that levels of the antimicrobial peptide (AMP), human ?-defensin-2, was significantly decreased in burned skin epithelia, absent in burn blister fluid and poorly expressed in lung during inhalation injury.We hypothesize that 1) deficient antimicrobial peptides in burn wound promote progressive colonization of pathogens in burn wounds and 2) replacing active peptide components will restore the antimicrobial activity in burn wounds. We have synthesized several cationic steroid antimicrobials (CSAs) which mimic naturally occurring AMPs functionally. In vitro experiments using one of these synthetic drugs with locally isolated common burn pathogen P. aeruginosa and S aureus demonstrate MIC values of 2.0?±?0.3??g/ml and 0.4?±?0.1??g/ml, respectively, indicating effectiveness of these compounds against burn pathogens. These drugs were tested for cytotoxicity on cultured human keratinocytes using MTT cell viability assay. Results indicate that these drugs are nontoxic to cultured keratinocytes at the level required for bacterial killing. Since theses drugs are membrane active compounds it will be hard for bacteria to develop resistance and there is a great potential to be developed for clinical treatment.

AB  - Abstract? Brooke Army Medical Center isolated 25 highly antibiotic-resistant Acinetobacter ssp. (primarily A. baumannii) from wounded soldiers returning from Iraq. Concern about effective treatment of these organisms led our institution to begin investigating low-frequency ultrasound (LFU) as a method of increasing the effectiveness of antibiotics on A.baumannii in wound management. Studies have suggested that LFU applied in conjunction with antibiotics may increase their overall effectiveness. We hypothesize that combining antibiotics with LFU may be an effective method of wound management and that this combination may be synergistic in its overall effect. In this initial work, we wanted to determine if sonocation would have an effect on our organism of interest, A. baumannii. We selected several organisms, both gram positive and gram negative, that have been shown to be killed by sonocation (E. coli, S. aureus, and S. pyogenes) and added three highly resistant A. baumannii isolates. Bacterial death was measured by both colony counts after 24 hours of growth and acridine orange staining using a standard protocol. Colony counts were significantly reduced by sonocation. Furthermore, A.'baumannii colony counts were also greatly reduced by sonocation. Actual cell destruction was also visualized using acridine orange staining. Our data support the assertion that sonocation has an antibacterial effect on some bacteria, including A. baumannii. Our next step is to add antimicrobial agents and determine if their effectiveness can be increased by sonocation.

AB  - Hypertrophic scarring is a pathological process characterized by a fibroblastic hyperproliferation and by an excess of deposition of extracellular matrix components. Hypothesis of abnormalities in epidermal-dermal cross talk has been laid down to explain this pathology. To check this affirmation, we used a tissue-engineered model of self-assembly reconstructed skin in order to mimic interactions between dermal and epidermal cells in normal or pathological skin. We performed those skin equivalents with three dermal cell types : normal wound (Wmyo) or hypertrophic wound (Hmyo) myofibroblasts and normal skin fibroblasts (Fb). Epidermis was reconstructed with normal skin keratinocytes (NK), hypertrophic scars keratinocytes (HK), or without any keratinocytes. In the absence of epidermis, Hmyo formed a thicker dermis than Wmyo. When seeded with NK, the dermal thickness of Hmyo and Fb dermis was significantly reduced while that of Wmyo was increased. However, the presence of HK always induced thicker dermis formation than observed with NK. HK also increase the production of extracellular matrix and reduce its degradation in comparison with NK. In addition, HK have more influence on dermal cells proliferation than NK. In conclusion, HK may play a more important role on fibrosis development than NK. The keratinocytes have distinct secretory patterns depending on their skin source. Wmyo and Hmyo do not react the same way to the presence of keratinocytes. These observations strongly suggest that HK have a more important role on pathological fibrosis development by influencing dermal cells behavior. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an ubiquitous enzyme produced by different cell types. Previous reports have demonstrated ALP induction by extracellular matrix, ascorbic acid or IL-6. Using histochemical techniques, we evaluated the ex vivo activity of ALP in incisional and excisional acute wounds, chronic wounds, and keloids in animal and human models. We also compared in situ ALP activity with type I/III collagen levels using histological methods (Herovici technique). Results demonstrated that 1) during the first stage of acute wound healing the increase in ALP activity precedes high levels of type III collagen, meanwhile type I collagen diminishes. When ALP activity disappears, the proportion of type I/III collagen returns to normal. 2) ALP activity is almost null in chronic wounds, which are characterized by thick type I collagen fibers and some type III collagen throughout the tissue. However, when the wound is treated, ALP activity rises to maximum levels together with type III collagen, but type I collagen is absent. 3) In keloids ALP activity is also absent; however when the scar is treated with a proinflammatory cytokine downmodulator (collagen-polyvinylpyrrolidone) endogenous type I collagen diminishes, while type III collagen and ALP activity are increased. Based on the above results we suggest that ALP activity is an acute inflammation marker since the enzyme levels are increased in acute wounds but not in chronic inflammation processes. Nevertheless, when chronic lesions or scars are in the process of healing, the increase in ALP activity is clear. And as a result, we believe that treatments for chronic wounds or scars induce acute inflammation and consequently stimulate wound repair or fibrolysis. In conclusion, ALP activity is an important factor to be considered in acute and chronic wound repair and their healing process.

AB  - Despite recent advances in wound care, chronic infected ulcers still remain a huge challenge to the modern society. Nitric oxide has been identified as a mediator for important biological processes such as vasodilation, antimicrobial, and wound repair. The aim of the present study was to explore the antimicrobial properties of exogenous nitric oxide gas (gNO) as well as its effect on skin cells in vitro. To test this, a specialized gNO chamber was designed to expose S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in saline continuously to 200?ppm gNO or air. A colony count was obtained following gNO treatment. Furthermore, fibroblast-populated collagen gel, keratinocytes, and endothelial cells were cultured in DMEM, KSFM, and M199, respectively. Endothelial migration was tested by a 3D Matrigel tubule formation assay. Fibroblast matrix production and keratinocyte differentiation were monitored by mRNA expression of procollagen type I, interstitial collagenase, and involucrin. All cells were exposed to 200?ppm gNO for 8 hours a day for 3 consecutive days. A MTT assay was used to observe cell proliferation. The results revealed 100% bacterial kill following 4 hour exposure to 200?ppm gNO. Interestingly this dose did not exhibit any significant toxic effect on fibroblast, keratinocyte, and endothelial proliferation. Dermal fibroblasts migration out of the collagen gel was not affected by gNO treatment when compared to the control. The keratinocytes in both groups were able to express involucrin, an indicator of cell?s ability to differentiate. The migration and tube formation by endothelial cells within the matrigel was not compromised following gNO treatment. In conclusion, the present study provided evidence for potential application of gNO for reducing bacterial burden in chronic infected wounds without compromising re-epithilialization, proliferation, and angiogenesis in the wound healing process.

AB  - Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy was used to measure the binding and diffusion of growth factors in model extracellular matrices in order to investigate the importance of protein-matrix interactions in regulating signaling molecules within a three-dimensional matrix. Two important growth factors were studied, transforming growth factor ?1 and basic fibroblast growth factor, which are known to have specific affinities for fibronectin and the heparan-sulfate-proteoglycan perlecan, respectively. Collagen-based matrices were prepared by polymerizing type I collagen in the presence of fibronectin or perlecan, and we measured diffusion constants and binding constants of the two growth factors. The binding constant measured for transforming growth factor ?1 with fibronectin-containing matrices was in good agreement with that measured using affinity chromatography. However, the interactions measured between fibroblast growth factor and perlecan were significantly weaker than expected. Surprisingly, the strongest interactions by far were with monomeric collagen solutions and fibrillar collagen matrices. Our findings suggest a central role for the three-dimensional fibrillar collagen matrix in growth factor interactions, with modulatory roles for fibronectin or perlecan.
