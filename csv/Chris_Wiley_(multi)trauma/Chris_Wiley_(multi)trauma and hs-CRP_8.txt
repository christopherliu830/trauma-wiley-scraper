AB  - Kinetics of urea extraction during a single dialysis session in children are unknown, because analysis of solutes in dialysate is difficult due to their extreme dilution. >Objective:? A novel urea monitor of the Gambro Company might be of help in studying urea kinetics also in children. Methods:? We studied 107 urea kinetics in 5 adolescents aged 13?19 years, weighing 26?58?kg, and looked for influences of membrane size, blood flow, and duration of one dialysis session. Urea measurement applies to the change of electric dialysate conductivity due to ionization because of urea splitting by urease. Bicarbonate dialysis regimen was 4?5?h each, 3 times a week, using polysulfone high-flux dialyzers (Fresenius F60 or F80, depending on body size). Results:? Average 4-h urea Kt/V values for F60 (n?=?85) were 1.69±0.53 and for F80 (n?=?21) 1.63±0.25, extracted urea mass was 16.0±5.4?g and 32.5±5.4?g, respectively (p?<?0.05); Kt/V urea results for blood flows of 180?220?mL/min were 1.36±0.52 and for <180?mL/min 1.10±0.43; extracted urea mass was 17.3±8.0 and 11.7±4.9?g, respectively (p?<?0.05). Total average urea extraction ratio after 2?h of dialysis (n?=?107) was 64.8±5.6%. Extraction ratio during the 4th h of dialysis was only 15.3±4.1% and during the 5th h not more than 9.0±3.6% of total urea extraction. Conclusion:? Kinetics of urea extraction helps understanding dialysis processes in children. Adapting the size of the dialyzer according to body size raises urea extraction and maintains urea clearance Kt/V at the desired quality level. An inadequate blood flow lowers both urea extraction and urea clearance Kt/V. Prolonging dialysis beyond 4?h is, at least in concern of urea kinetic modelling, a rather ineffective means. We speculate that children with blood flow problems should be dialysed more often.

AB  - Heparin is almost universally used as an anticoagulant during hemodialysis. Rare but serious side effects of heparin therapy include heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and anaphylaxis, and these may lead to significant mortality and morbidity if left unrecognized. We are reporting a patient who developed HIT followed by an anaphylactoid reaction. This 8-year-old girl with Joubert's syndrome developed end-stage renal disease secondary to nephronophthisis. She had a Permacath double-lumen hemodialysis catheter placed in the right internal jugular vein and was started on hemodialysis using an Asahi B10 65 Dialyzer on 1/28/03. The platelet count at that time was 246???103/mL. Beef lung heparin was used for anticoagulation. She was admitted for living related donor renal transplant on 2/10/03 but was found to be thrombocytopenic with a platelet count of 49???103/mL. The transplant was postponed, a sepsis work-up was performed, and she was started on antibiotics pending culture results. Hemodialysis was continued with heparin anticoagulation, and despite an improvement in the platelet count she had an acute anaphylactoid reaction 2 days later. The reaction occurred 20?min after starting her hemodialysis treatment and presented as acute onset of bronchospasm, agitation, and chest discomfort. She improved with nebulized albuterol and subcutaneous epinephrine. A review of her records revealed that she had received 6 hemodialysis treatments. The platelet count on 2/3/03, after 3 hemodialysis treatments, had been 242???103/mL and on 2/8/03 after 5 treatments the platelet count was 72???103/mL. HIT with anaphylaxis was suspected. Heparin was discontinued and the platelet count had returned to normal within 2 days. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive heparin-associated antibody test. While HIT is recognized as a complication in 1?5% of patients treated with heparin and has been well described in the literature, we could only find 2 reported cases of heparin-induced anaphylaxis and in both cases there was accompanying thrombocytopenia. This patient further illustrates a possible linkage between these two phenomena. HIT is an important cause of thrombocytopenia in a patient on hemodialysis and continued exposure to heparin may induce anaphylaxis.

AB  - Quality control of dialysis treatment has received wide attention since inadequate dialysis dose was an independent risk factor of morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients. Each 0.1 decrease in Kt/V less than 1.2 is estimated to increase the relative risk of death by 5?7%. A higher Kt/V can be achieved by increasing treatment time, using a larger dialyzer or increasing blood or dialysate flow rates. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to know, using online conductivity monitor (OCM) routinely, whether a certain subgroup of patients is being treated inadequately. 24 anuric patients were included in a cross-sectional study: 20.8% were diabetics, mean age 64.7?±?18.2 years; 16% females. Access blood were AVFI and the effective dialyzed blood flow was set at 350?mL/min, with recirculation <5%. BMI was 25.4?±?3.8?kg/m2 and body weight was 69.7?±?12?kg. All patients were dialyzed thrice weekly (245?±?21?min) with dialysis machine 4008H (Fresenius Medical Care) equipped with OCM monitor and the hollow fiber high-flux polysulfone membrane (HF-80 1.8?m2) and helixone (Fx-60, 1.6?m2). Dialysate flow was maintained at 500?mL/min, with standard dialysate liquid. Drug therapy was not varied. OCM was validated for our population and reported in other abstracts (r2?=?0.96, p?<?0.001). Inadequate dialysis dose was considered at OCM Kt/V less than 1.2. Data were processed and statistically analyzed with SPSS 11.0 software package. Watson volume (Wv) to other baseline characteristics was assessed by using contingency tables, t-tests, analysis of variance, and linear regression, as appropriate. All the tests were performed for a 0.05 significance level. The OCM Kt/V weekly was inversely related to Wv (r?=??0.833, p?<?0.001). 20.8% of our patients are at risk of inadequate dialysis dose, and it reflects our current practice of dialysis prescription. All of them are anuric young men with a Wv?>?40?L. Specific efforts are required to deliver an adequate dialysis dose in this kind of patients. This can be achieved by altering dialysis frequency, increasing membrane surface, and/or increasing dialysis flow. OCM Kt/V device permits a daily dialysis dose delivery and, consequently, an individualized prescription. Prospective studies are required to establish whether adequate dialysis dose in patients with Wv?>?40?L may further improve their survival.

AB  - Survival has been defined as an index of adequacy of dialysis. These hard data are the basis for comparing results obtained by different schedules or policies. The aim of the study was to assess mortality rate recorded within a system of tailored dialysis (1?6 dialysis per week in out-of-hospital settings: home hemodialysis, self- and limited care dialysis). Data recorded in a single center (1998?2003) were compared with data gathered in the Registry of Dialysis and Transplantation in the whole Region (1998?2000). Methods:? Out-of-hospital dialysis unit is active since 1971, in which a new program integrating self- and limited care and home dialysis started since 1998. Patients:? Incident dialysis patients starting renal replacement therapy within the program and all further patients starting dialysis in the Region in the same period were compared in an historical prospective cohort study. Results:? 55 patients in the Unit and further 1443 patients in the whole Region started RRT since 1998. Main features of 55 patients were 32 males 23 females; median age 51 years, range 20?76; 72.7% displaying at least 1 comorbid factor. Throughout the period gross mortality rate was 4/125 patient-years in the Center. Kaplan?Meier curves showed a 1-year survival of 100% vs. 91%, respectively, in the Center and in the whole Region, and a 2-year survival of 95.5% vs. 76.6%, respectively, in the Center and in the whole Region (p?=?0.001). The main demographic features were remarkably different in both settings (for the whole Region median age 66 years, range 2.2?101, at least 1 comorbidity in 56.9% of patients). In an attempt to correct for the different baseline characteristics, a multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed. The whole model resulted in statistically significant value (p?=?0.000) and an increasing mortality risk resulted for age at starting dialysis, diabetes, and collagenopathy. In conclusion, tailored, high-efficiency dialysis policy may allow superior survival results. A longer follow up is needed to confirm our approach; in larger cohorts, the finding of a low mortality rate in a relatively young population with high comorbidity may underline the need to review our current concepts on dialysis adequacy.

AB  - One of the main symptoms of terminal-stage chronic renal insufficiency is anemia. One of the best applicable methods correcting anemia is using recombinant human erythropoietin preparation. Using recombinant human erythropoietin in patients with terminal-stage chronic renal insufficiency in 90?95% of events had a positive effect, but 5?10% of patient had refraction to erythropoietin, which has spurred the search for new efficient methods correcting anemia. The purpose of the study was to determine the influence of the laser on erythropoiesis and blood acid?alkaline condition (pH) in patients with terminal-stage chronic renal insufficiency. In the course of the study, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, reticulocytes in blood, and blood acid?alkaline condition (pH) were determined. At the beginning of the treatment, all hematological parameters 5 and 15 days after marrow stimulation were defined. 15 days after marrow stimulation with laser, increasing amounts of erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were observed. The initial erythrocyte count was 2.22?±?0.1???1012/L, hemoglobin 67.7?±?3.2?g/L and hematocrit 18.2?±?1.2%. During the laser treatment, erythrocyte count increased up to 2.9?±?0.8???1012/L, hemoglobin up to 89.6?±?2.9?g/L and hematocrit up to 28.2?±?1.3% (p?<?0005).

AB  - The establishment and maintenance of vascular access in end-stage renal disease provides a greater challenge. Adequate dialytic therapy requires reliable, long-term access to the blood circulation. Vascular access remains the Achilles' heel of chronic hemodialysis; complications are costly for the patient and society. Vascular access failure is the most frequent cause of hospitalization for patients with chronic renal disease. The general goal was to prevent thrombectomies, thus preventing hospitalizations and reducing cost, and most importantly, saving the patient's access and increasing the survival rate of the graft or fistula. A protocol to evaluate the vascular accesses at the dialysis centers where our patients are dialyzing was implemented. The patients are evaluated before their dialysis treatments, every 2 months if they have a graft and every other visit (4 months) if they have a fistula. New patients will be evaluated every visit by the vascular technician. The protocol (US Vascular Access Protocol) also has attention parameters and depth considerations. The attention parameters refers to blood flows and reductions in size. For example, for a fistula, a normal flow will be 400?mL/min or above, an alert value will be 390?mL/min or below, and a reduction in size of 1.9?mm or below will also be an alert value for the fistula (Table?I). Depth considerations relate to how deep the access is, for example 2?3?mm is ideal to cannulate, 8?mm and above make cannulation impossible (Table?II). Patients with vascular problems are then referred to the vascular surgeon or, as mostly, are referred to interventional radiology. We have found that these Doppler reports are very accurate, and after almost a year, doing these tests at the dialysis center, many accesses have been saved, and dialysis quality has improved in those patients by resolving issues causing re-circulation, stenosis, etc. In conclusion, we need to continue evaluating this program, but the preliminary reports show that by using the Doppler studies prophylactically, dialysis accesses can be saved or their use prolonged, thereby saving costs and reducing the need for future sites for the patient. And, in some cases, improving dialysis adequacy. 1 Attention parameters Normal values Alert values Fistula Access volume flow (mL/min) ≥400 ?0?390 Reductions (mm) ≥2.0 ?0?1.9 Graft Access volume flow (mL/min) ≥600 ?0?590 Reductions (%) 0?49 50?100 2 Depth considerations 2?3?mm Ideal and easy to cannulate 4?5?mm Is acceptable 6?7?mm Increases difficulty of cannulation and increases vessel wall damage ≥8?mm Makes cannulation difficult-to-impossible, causes significant wall damage and infiltrations, requires longer cannula

AB  - Background:? Hemodialyzers can be used once or reused after treatment with chemicals or hot water. SU results in infusion of plastic compounds, particularly phthalic acid metabolites, into patients and chemical reuse releases formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, or peracetic acid into the blood during dialysis. Methods:? We studied the increase in pulse rate (PR) and fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and patients' subjective overall quality evaluation (OE) of dialysis (1 worst, 5 best) during 3706 daily dialyses in 23 patients. Fall in blood pressure and rise in PR during dialysis and overall quality evaluation were compared as patients changed from SU or chemical reuse to hot water reuse. During SU and chemical reuse, dialysis time was shorter (121 vs. 148?min), urea clearance higher (241 vs. 175?ml/min) but ultrafiltration lower (1.5 vs. 1.7?kg/dialysis) than during hot water reuse. Results:? The results are summarized in the table. Methods n Systolic BP Diastolic BP PR OE CRU ??98 ?30?±?19 ?17?±?21 ???4?±?4 3.8?±?0.4 SU 2443 ?17?±?21 ??6?±?13 ???2?±?13 4.0?±?0.7 HWR 1165 ??8?±?21 ??1?±?11 ?0.2?±?12 4.2?±?0.7 All comparisons were of SU and chemical reuse to hot water reuse, p?<?0.0001. The results were the same whether cellulosic or polysulfone membranes were used. Hot water reuse, up to 25 times, did not result in changes in urea clearance, albumin leakage or Kuf, and ?-2-microglobulin reduction rates declined by only 10% over 15 reuses. Conclusion:? Hot water reuse results in the most comfortable dialysis and the best cardiovascular stability, with less decline in blood pressure and less tachycardia, when compared to chemical reuse or SU of dialyzers.

AB  - Objective:? To have 1 nurse successfully train 2 patients at a time for nightly home hemodialysis (NHHD) within a 7?10 week time period. Methods:? Over the past 6 years, Lynchburg Nephrology Dialysis Inc. has evolved its NHHD program from 1 nurse training 1 patient during an average 6 week period to training 2 patients in a 7?10 week period. Patients came either from our in-center population or directly from internal medicine. Our pre-evaluation procedures and manual were revised. Patients were pre-evaluated for literacy, manual dexterity, strength, hearing and visual deficits, substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and compliance before being accepted into the program. A home visit was made to evaluate their environment, family interactions, and water source. Our training manual was rewritten to fifth grade level. Every patient was given index cards printed in 20 size font with step-by-step procedures for machine setup, put-on and takeoff, re-circulation, and power failure. Patients were dialyzed 4 days/week to improve cognitive function and ?dialyzed the bucket? 1 day, thus training 5 days/week. One nurse trained 2 patients, staggering their start dates 2 weeks apart to allow for both individual and group teaching. Fistula or IJ catheter was used for access. Patients were trained alone or with a partner. In the last week of training, patients were dialyzed for 7?h and were expected to complete all procedures independently. Results:? From March 2003 to August 2003, 6 patients were trained for NHHD. 2 patients finished training in 7 weeks, 2 in 9 weeks, and 2 in 10 weeks. Conclusion:? One nurse can successfully train 2 patients at a time for NHHD in a 7?10 week time period at a decreased cost to dialysis provider.

AB  - Home hemodialysis (HHD) patients are often inconvenienced when intravenous iron preparations are administered. Formerly, these patients received their medication in the clinic on an off-dialysis day or during in-center hemodialysis (HD). For the last 2 years, 5 patients in our HHD program have been receiving intravenous ferric gluconate during their routine HD session. Procedure:? All patients were trained in the proper administration of ferric gluconate in-center. No test dose was administered. Ferric gluconate was infused via the heparin infusion pump on their HD machine at a rate of 31.25?mg/h. Doses were of either 62.5?mg or 125?mg per session. K/DOQI guidelines for intravenous iron use were adhered to. TSATs greater than 25%, ferritin greater than 100?ng/mL and less than 800?ng/mL, and hemoglobin between 11 and 12?g% were the goals of therapy. Both loading doses (8 doses during sequential HD sessions) and maintenance doses every week or every other week were employed. Results:? Over the last 2 years, 223 doses were administered at home. No serious reactions occurred during the course of therapy. One patient experienced minor nausea and vomiting during one dose, which was thought to be possibly related to the iron infusion. This patient subsequently received ferric gluconate again without difficulty. Conclusion:? Ferric gluconate can be safely administered at home during HHD.

AB  - The influence of dialysis prescription on outcome is well established. Hemodialysis dose has been shown to have a distinct impact upon the morbidity and mortality rate in patients on regular treatment therapy. Hence, adequacy of dialysis should be guaranteed. New devices based in online conductivity measures have been developed to achieve an adequate dialysis dose. The aim of this study was to compare online conductivity monitor (OCM) with dialysis dose standard methods (Daugirdas Kt/V). 24 anuric patients were included in a cross-sectional study: 20.8% were diabetics, mean age 64.7?±?18.2 years; 16% females. Access blood were AVFi and the effective dialyzed blood flow was set at 350?mL/min, with recirculation <5%. BMI was 25.4?±?3.8?kg/m2 and body weight was 69.7?±?12?kg. All patients were dialyzed thrice weekly (245?±?21?min) with dialysis machine 4008H (Fresenius Medical Care) equipped with OCM monitor and the hollow fiber high-flux polysulfone membrane (HF-80 1.8?m2) and helixone (Fx-60, 1.6?m2). Dialysate flow was maintained at 500?mL/min, with standard dialysate liquid. Drug therapy was not varied. Each patient was subjected to OCM on midweek day, during 3 consecutive weeks on the same day that blood Kt/V samples were taken as well. Each patient got 3 OCM measurements and Kt/V samples. Data were processed and statistically analyzed with SPSS 11.0 software package. Kt/V OCM relation to other baseline characteristics was assessed by using contingency tables, t-tests, analysis of variance, and linear regression, as appropriate. All the tests were performed for a 0.05 significance level.

Also, OCM allows for an individualized dialysis dose. Furthers studies are required to evaluate its influence on patients' evolution.

AB  - Abstract Background The aim was to study risk-factors for vascular thrombosis and incidence of pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) in splenectomized children with hereditary spherocytosis (HS) at a single center. Procedure Pre- and post-splenectomy hemoglobin and platelet counts were recorded. Post-splenectomy lipid-profile, fibrinogen, D-dimer, CRP and anti-coagulant-protein levels were compared to established controls. Echo-Doppler was performed for PAH. Results Twenty-six children with HS had undergone splenectomy; the mean age at surgery was 7.9?±?3.7 years. Nineteen of the 26 were prospectively investigated at a median duration of 4.5 years (range: 4 months to 19 years) following splenectomy. Thrombocytosis was observed in 19 (73%), whereas no patient had erythrocytosis at the last follow-up visit. Total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglyceride levels were not deranged (P?≥?0.3). Mean CRP levels (males: 2.8?±?0.5; females: 2.1?±?0.5?mg/L) were significantly higher than described for normal children (P?<?0.001). Six (23%) patients had a positive D-dimer assay. Protein S, anti-thrombin-III and fibrinogen were in range. A single patient had a borderline low protein C activity. Lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin antibody assays were negative. The mean tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRJV) was 1.8?±?0.55?meter per second (range: 0?2.4). None had a TRJV ≥2.5?meter per second to suggest PAH. Conclusions There was no evidence of PAH, dyslipidemia, elevation of fibrinogen or a reduction in anti-coagulant proteins, at a median follow-up duration of 4.5 years following splenectomy in children with HS. However, elevated CRP level (42%), persistent thrombocytosis (73%) and elevated D-dimer levels (23%) were observed. These have been recognized as risk factors for cerebrovascular and coronary heart disease. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2014;61:29?33. ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background and Purpose:? Colloid osmotic pressure (COP) in plasma rises by ultrafiltration during hemodialysis, and it consequently causes plasma refilling in which water moves from interstitial tissue to capillary space. Although hemodynamic stability is one of the important factors for good dialysis outcome, no informative and convenient indicators are available other than monitoring of blood pressure. Thus, we measured COP during hemodialysis whether COP can be used as an indicator for the hemodynamic status in comparison with hematocrit (Ht). Plasma osmolality, ultrafiltration volume, and the alteration of blood pressure were also measured to examine whether COP is associated with them. Method:? Sixteen patients hospitalized in this hospital were examined. Amongst them, 10 patients underwent both dialysis and ultrafiltration, while 4 patients received only dialysis and 2 patients were with ultrafiltration only by extracorporeal ultrafiltration method. Ultrafiltration was performed with constant speed to the dry weight for 4?h. The measurements of COP, plasma osmolality, Ht levels, and blood pressure were performed at 30?min (12.5% of the total water removal), 1?h (25%), 2?h (50%), and 3?h (75%) after the start of hemodialysis and also at the end of dialysis (100%). Result:? COP markedly rose by 26.0% (±13.3%) in the patients who received both dialysis and ultrafiltration, whereas Ht rose by only 13.6% (±5.21%). And the curve for COP increase was sigmoid shape, whereas that for Ht showed linear change. On the other hand, in the patients whose Ht levels showed low values, the curves for both COP and Ht showed similar pattern. Conclusion:? These results suggest that COP is a more sensitive indicator to be monitored for the hemodynamic status than Ht during hemodialysis.

AB  - A high mortality rate after hip arthroplasty has been reported in hemodialysis patients; however, there has been no previous study on predictors of mortality after hip arthroplasty so far. Objectives:? The purpose of the present study was to identify any risk factors associated with early death in hemodialysis patients undergoing hip arthroplasty. Methods:? We retrospectively reviewed 34 patients on hemodialysis who underwent hip arthroplasty between 1994 and 2001. The average age was 60 years, and the average hemodialysis duration was 116 months at the time of operation. Body mass index (BMI), operating time, and total blood loss were reviewed. Serum levels of albumin (Alb), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), alkaline phosphatase (Alp), and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) were measured preoperatively. Results:? Of these 34 patients, 9 died (26%). There were 2 perioperative deaths and 7 during follow-up period between 2 and 19 months. No significant difference was found with respect to patient age, hemodialysis duration, Alb, Ca, P, Alp, operating time, and total blood loss. Patients with lower BMI and PTH levels had an earlier mortality than patients with higher BMI and PTH levels (p?<?0.05 and p?<?0.01). Conclusion:? We conclude that despite an intensive care directed to our hemodialysis patients, the incidence of early death after hip arthroplasty is still high. If low BMI and serum levels of low PTH were detected before operation, we should pay special attention to early mortality after hip arthroplasty.

AB  - Background:? A recent meta-analysis suggested that the relative risk of mortality is 8% higher in private for-profit hemodialysis (HD) centers than private not-for-profit HD centers (Devereaux et al. JAMA 2002; 288: 2449). Objective:? To assess the association between dialysis center profit status and mortality using USRDS data in the current era under DOQI guidelines. Methods:? We studied incident HD patients from 1995 to 2000 who had Medicare as primary payer during the 4th through 6th month after ESRD initiation. Patients who died or underwent transplant during the 6 months after initiation were excluded. Primary dialysis provider was determined from the majority provider during the 6 months after initiation. Patient mortality for the following 12 months was evaluated via Cox regression, which adjusted for age, gender, primary cause of ESRD, race, cumulative hospital days, and comorbidity measures, which were assessed through both Medicare claims during the entry period and the Medicare Evidence form 2728. Patients were followed up until transplantation, death, or completion of the 12 months. Results:? 189,932 patients receiving HD during 1995?2000 were included in our analysis. The adjusted mortality rate was 271.6 per 1000 person-years at the private for-profit centers and 272.2 at the private not-for-profit centers. The mortality risk relative to private for-profit vs. not-for-profit centers was 1.009 (95% CI, 0.978?1.042; p?=?0.558). Sub-analyses that excluded hospital-based facilities showed similar results. Although public not- for-profit facilities were excluded from the analysis, a sub-analysis performed with these also showed similar results. Conclusion:? Our results suggest that dialysis center profit status was not associated with mortality. This lack of association was found in the combined 1995?2000 population and in separate models for each year. Freestanding vs. hospital-based and public vs. non-public facility had no impact on the results.

AB  - Nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy (NFD) is a rare entity affecting patients with renal failure, often on chronic dialysis or after transplantation (TXP). The patient profile at risk for this debilitating condition is yet undefined as is the role of renal failure in its etiology. We diagnosed 4 chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients with NFD. A 55-year-old Caucasian male on HD for 5 years, secondary to diabetic nephropathy, developed woody, indurated skin of the extremities, decreased mobility, and wheelchair dependence. He died within 1 year. A 66-year-old African-American male with diabetes, hypertension, and pancreatic cancer developed thick indurated skin on his extremities after being on HD for approximately 20 months. He died 3 months later from sepsis. A 26-year-old Caucasian female on HD for approximately 10 years, secondary to hyperoxaluria-induced renal failure, had undergone combined liver and kidney TXP with primary nonfunction of the renal TXP. She succumbed to cholangitis approximately 1 year after progressive skin thickening and joint contractures were noted. A 75-year-old Caucasian female with renal failure secondary to recurrent hemolytic uremic syndrome and TXP failure was dialysis dependent for 6 years. Over a 3-month period, she developed skin changes consistent with NFD and entered hospice care secondary to marked deterioration in her quality of life. In all of these cases, skin changes were restricted to the extremities, sparing the trunk, face, and internal organs. Skin biopsy findings included thickened dermis with particularly thickened collagen bundles, mucin deposition, and fibroblast proliferation and were distinct from scleromyxedema and scleroderma. Autoimmune disease workup was negative. Indeed, NFD is a novel cutaneous fibrosing disorder of progressively debilitating nature in patients with renal failure that needs further clinical and pathological characterization.

AB  - In early 2003, cases of SARS had surfaced around the world. The vast majority happened in China, Hong Kong, and Canada. In Toronto, the individual who manifested symptoms of SARS after visiting China died on March 22, 2003. A few days later SARS was declared a provincial emergency. Corona virus, the causative agent, is not well known. Its transmission and mutation had to be researched. Shortly thereafter, clusters of people were showing symptoms of the virus. There were 258 probable cases of SARS by May 14. The Ontario Ministry of Health and health care providers took steps to contain the virus, isolating those who were exposed and adopting new infection control procedures. On May 17, the provincial emergency was lifted. On May 25, there was a new wave of SARS cases (2nd outbreak). This was traced back to an RN who worked in a non-SARS unit. Nurses working directly with SARS were faced with very challenging times. SARS was a huge concern and impacted all health care professionals. The hemodialysis unit was no exception. After all, dialysis patients are already immunocompromised, mostly elderly, and frequent visits to the hospital make them more susceptible to the virus. Objective:? To identify how hemodialysis nurses were impacted by the SARS outbreak and the nursing management to control the disease. Method:? Saint Michael's Hospital in Toronto took a leadership role and became one of the SARS Tertiary Response Team. Four hemodialysis nurses were designated as trainers to train the other staff regarding infection prevention and control. Measures were in place such as: (a) strict screening methods for patients, staff, and visitors; (b) mask fitting for all staff; (c) use of PPE (protective protection equipment) (d) use of Hospital ID bar code for staff to declare themselves free of SARS. Results/Conclusion:? On August 25, there was only one probable case and there was no evidence of transmission of the virus in the hemodialysis unit. As for the nurses and all the unsung heroes who always put the needs and safety of their patients ahead of themselves, they continue to be dedicated in maintaining quality patient care even in the face of crisis or in an environment of fear.

AB  - The Dialysis Outcome and Quality Initiative has guidelines for vascular access and states that the dialysis catheter (DC) should be limited to less than 20% of the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Our center has found this target difficult to achieve. Objective:? We wondered what the reasons for use of a DC might be. Methods:? We noted the number of patients with a DC in place and assessed the reasons why the DC was being used on 8/1/03. Results:? 73 of the 170 (42.9%) patients had a DC on 8/1/03. 24 (32.9%) of the patients refused to have initial arteriovenous fistulae or grafts (AVF/G) or a secondary AVF/G revision or replacement procedure performed after initial AVF/G failure. 15 (20.5%) patients had a maturing AVF/G, 12 (16.4%) had significant medical and/or surgical contraindications for AVF/G placement, 9 (12.3%) patients were awaiting surgical thrombectomy, revision or placement of AVF/G, 6 patients (8.2%) were awaiting transfer to CPD therapy, 4 (5.5%) patients were undecided about having an AVF/G placed, and 1 (1.4%) had acute renal failure and early ESRD recovery was expected. Only 2 (2.7%) patients had no access plan by the nephrology team. Conclusions:? Patients' refusal for an AVF/G placement and patients with a maturing AVF/G or awaiting surgical revision or placement were the most common reasons for the use of a DC in our center. To significantly impact on the high use of the DC, it would be crucial to better understand the reasons for patients? refusals.

AB  - In March 2003, a series of cases of sudden respiratory disease syndrome (SARS) has been reported to be spreading in Toronto. With limited knowledge of the causative agent, an immediate strategy that would help contain and prevent the dissemination of the disease especially among our immunosuppressed hemodialysis patients was required. Objective:? To share the precautionary measures implemented in our unit in containing or preventing the spread of the virus among our hemodialysis patients. Methods:? Retrospective analysis of the impact of the implementation of strict measure of disease control and education of all staff. Other data were gathered through interviews of some Microbiologists in Toronto, St. Michael's Hospital Infection Control Department and Health, Canada. Result:? The precautionary measure implemented has been successful. None of our dialysis patients or health care workers were affected. Conclusion:? The measures implemented has not been proven 100% effective in protecting our dialysis patients and our staff, but we hope that the data will help prepare other health care professionals and other dialysis institutions in the event of another outbreak.

AB  - Vacuum Assisted Closure?(or V.A.C.?)* Therapy is the negative pressure wound therapy provided by the V.A.C.? System, available from KCI USA, Inc. This study was conducted in young Yorkshire swine to evaluate the effect of V.A.C.? locally and systemically on wound healing and cytokine levels in wound fluid and tissue and in serum. Two full thickness, excisional wounds were created on the dorsum of swine. In Group 1 (n?=?6), one wound received V.A.C.? Therapy using a polyurethane foam V.A.C.? dressing and 125?mm?Hg continuous negative pressure, and the second wound received DuoDERM?** without negative pressure. Group 2 animals (n?=?4) served as controls and received only DuoDERM? on both wounds. Blood, wound fluid, and biopsy samples were taken at predetermined intervals and the levels of 10 cytokines and growth factors, the acute-phase inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP), and immunoglobulins M & G were tested by ELISA. Preliminary data from the first phase of the study (n?=?2 swine/group) indicated a trend toward lower serum CRP values and higher serum IgM and IgG levels in swine treated with V.A.C.? Therapy compared to controls. The remaining swine are being evaluated to determine whether V.A.C.? Therapy moderates the local inflammatory wound healing response. In addition, testing of splenic lymphocyte and peripheral blood lymphocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte functions are being performed to study possible systemic effects on the immune system.
