AB  - Background:? Photochemical tissue bonding (PTB) is a novel method for producing a strong tissue-tissue seal using photosensitization. PTB cross-links tissues without causing thermal damage, although the mechanism of action in skin is not completely understood. Apligraf, a bilayered tissue-engineered skin construct, is currently applied to chronic wounds and fixed in place by bolster, suture, staple, or glue. We postulated that PTB may have application for attaching Apligraf to skin. Materials and Methods:? An ex vivo model was used to characterize bonding of Apligraf and skin by PTB. Argon laser (514?nm) or IPL irradiation in the presence of the photosensitizing dye Rose Bengal was used to bond Apligraf and human cadaveric or porcine skin. Various outcome measurements were made to evaluate the efficacy and histological characteristics of the bonding. Conclusions:? Photochemical tissue bonding of Apligraf to human skin can be performed and further characterization is under way. Potential applications of PTB and Apligraf include the treatment of acute wounds, split thickness skin graft donor sites, burns, and debrided chronic wounds.

AB  - The understanding of bioengineered tissue has evolved over the past 5 years. Now considered ?cell therapy,? bioengineered tissue can provide a nonhealing wound with the appropriate complement of cytokines, growth factors, and healthy cells to promote the patient?s healing process. As clinicians have gained experience with Apligraf*, the process of wound bed preparation has proven to be a critical step in order to achieve optimal outcomes with the tissue construct. Recently, the investigators have evaluated a novel device, MIST? ultrasound , recently FDA cleared for the cleansing and debriding of wounds. A subgroup from a total of 23 patients in a research trial using MIST therapy for nonhealing wounds received an Apligraf as part of their treatment regimen. The'bioengineered tissue remained intact for a full 4 weeks postapplication and the appearance of the graft was quite different than our prior experience with the product. On removal of the wound/graft eschar, patients had achieved complete epithelialization. This report describes the patients who underwent this combination of technologies along with wound photographs, measurements and patient histories. As we learn more about the biochemistry of healing we are able to ?look? at how we combine and use advanced wound care technologies. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Wound healing is a multistep process that concludes with scar formation. A common clinical observation is that oral wounds exhibit privileged healing compared to extra-oral wounds. Current data demonstrates reduced inflammation and more rapid reepithelialization of oral wounds suggesting that reduced inflammation is vital to privileged repair. To examine the initiation of inflammation, the present study examines IL-1α, IL-? and TNFα production by oral versus cutaneous keratinocytes and compares mast cell infiltration in oral versus cutaneous wounds. Two 1?mm diameter excisional wounds were placed on the lateral tongue or dorsal skin of anesthetized BALB/c mice. At 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after injury, wound tissue was harvested for analysis. Cytokine expression levels were measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR normalized to actin. At every time point, levels of IL-1α, IL-? and TNFα mRNA were less in oral than dermal wounds. When analyzed by ELISA, IL-1 protein levels peaked at 6 hours in both oral and cutaneous wounds, yet the levels were lower in oral wounds. Mast cell infiltration was measured by counting toluidine blue positive cells in fixed wound sections. The number of mast cells/mm2 was decreased overall in oral mucosal wounds. These findings suggest that a decreased early inflammatory response to injury may be responsible for the privileged repair of oral mucosa.

AB  - Advocate Christ hospital is a 650-bed, level-one tertiary-care center that created a comprehensive wound care program in November 1998. Over the first 3 years of the program there were over 140 admissions per year directly from the wound center along with numerous hospital to hospital transfers for complex wound management. Prevalence rates therefore increased linearly over this time frame. The wound team calculated a system-wide (eight hospitals) spend of $2.1 million per year for specialty rental beds. Incidence rates for the system were at, but not lower than, national levels despite the high cost incurred. A $1.3 million capital purchase for KCI atmos-air 9000? mattresses resulted in the complete replacement of all medical surgical beds in all eight hospitals. An internal prevalence and incidence team was created and data were collected both at the hospital and system-wide level on a quarterly basis. Hospital and system incidence rates fell to or below 7%(targeted goal) and the entire project will achieve a return on investment in 18 months. Data to be presented include prevalence and incidence results, rental bed costs pre- and postbed purchase, and a detailed review of the process of creating an electronic prevalence and incidence tracking system.

AB  - Previous wound healing studies have attempted to improve angiogenesis (new blood vessel ingrowth). Recent studies suggest, however, that revascularization of wounds may also be accomplished by vasculogenesis: endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from the bone marrow and blood that home to sites of tissue damage and form new blood vessels. The goal of this study was to evaluate the use of systemic and topical transplantation of EPCs for wound healing in an in vivo rabbit model. It was hypothesized that applying cells topically through an EPC-seeded albumin scaffold may promote revascularization from inside the wound versus only from the periphery. Further, it was hypothesized that combining topical and systemic transplantation of EPCs may increase vessel formation from both directions. Full thickness wounds were created on the dorsum of New Zealand White rabbits. Wounds were treated with either an EPC-seeded scaffold, nonseeded scaffold, or no treatment (control). Additionally, half of the animals were given systemic injections of EPCs. Digital pictures were taken weekly until sacrifice to determine healing rates. Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging scans were used to measure changes in blood perfusion during healing. Animals were sacrificed at 2 or 4 weeks; wounds were excised and prepared for histological examination. Histomorphometry was used to calculate epithelialization and contraction rates, as well as the volume fraction of cell nuclei and blood vessels. Preliminary results suggest that animals that received systemic transplantations of EPCs had higher overall healing rates than those with no injection. Systemic transplantation alone improved healing over the control by the end of 2 weeks. When combined with a topical scaffold (both EPC-seeded and nonseeded), systemically injected cells showed improved healing by the end of the first week. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - The paradigms of surgical wound closure are direct repair, grafts, and flaps. The core subject of plastic surgery, these distinct modalities are a sophisticated art that can reliably close any healthy wound. The caveat is that ordinary surgery implicitly depends on competent wound healing. With pathological wounds, those due to vascular, hematological, immunopathic, and other ulcerogenic diseases, these modalities may not work. The operation is threatened if wound healing is retarded, and incisions and donor sites are subject to morbidity from active disease. Disease and risks may limit potential donor tissues, sustain inflammation and lysis, restrict circulation, or make the patient too ill for elaborate procedures. Integra? collagen-chondroitin matrix has ideal properties for managing chronic pathological wounds: a high-grade artificial skin; survives disease and conditions where grafts die; performs the coverage duties of flaps without donor sites; minimizes nursing care; suppresses inflammation, wound healing, and scar; induces embryonic dermatogenesis. Risk free to the recipient, it is safe where disease and altered anatomy make conventional closure impossible or unsafe. Its indications, use, results, and conceptual basis make it a distinct fourth paradigm of surgical wound closure: in situ tissue engineering. Understanding when a flap should but cannot be used is to understand when Integra should be used. Study:? Using a consistent set of indications and management scheme, Integra was used for chronic pathological wounds in 111 patients (158 individual ulcers, 166 instances of exposed anatomical structures, diverse diagnoses). Success rate was 92% of patients healed; 90% of open structures healed. Inpatient services were nearly eliminated. Integra is not an alternative to conventional repair, grafts, and flaps. As a method of tissue engineering, it is a new and equal paradigm of care with its own indications and contraindications, and a superior safety and success profile. Repair, grafts, and flaps, which require wound healing competency, are best suited for healthy and acute wounds. For many chronic and pathological wounds, in situ matrix-guided histogenesis is the best method, and surgeons must begin working this into their practices.

AB  - Bacterial growth within extended use wound dressings remains a problem. We have developed a superabsorbent, microbicidal dressing based on the permanent attachment of a cationic polymer (the quaternary ammonium compound diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, DADMAC) onto a range of physical substrates. Treated gauze (Sof-Wick?) absorbed 50x its weight in saline and reduced bacterial, viral and fungal growth by six logs in vitro (AATCC method 100), with no zone of inhibition or extractables, as shown in Figure 1 below. Bacterial kill occurs within minutes, and remains effective in 10% serum. Good hemostatic properties were demonstrated for treated gauze wound dressing using both a rat liver laceration model, and a renal artery transection model, showing equivalent efficacy to approved haemorrhage control dressings (Avitene, Surgicel, and Gel Foam) that do not claim microbicidal activity. Treated gauze passed cytotoxicity testing using rabbit eye and skin tests, as well as guinea pig dermal sensitization tests. 1 Gauze sponges inoculated with E. Coli and stained for bacterial presence. Left is control; right is NIMBUS treated. Note no zone of inhibition around treated gauze. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Sepsis remains the single most important cause for multiple organ failure and death following burn injury for which no effective treatment is currently available. Burn injury is associated with immunosuppression which promotes sepsis. Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that levels of the antimicrobial peptide (AMP), human ?-defensin-2, was significantly decreased in burned skin epithelia, absent in burn blister fluid and poorly expressed in lung during inhalation injury.We hypothesize that 1) deficient antimicrobial peptides in burn wound promote progressive colonization of pathogens in burn wounds and 2) replacing active peptide components will restore the antimicrobial activity in burn wounds. We have synthesized several cationic steroid antimicrobials (CSAs) which mimic naturally occurring AMPs functionally. In vitro experiments using one of these synthetic drugs with locally isolated common burn pathogen P. aeruginosa and S aureus demonstrate MIC values of 2.0?±?0.3??g/ml and 0.4?±?0.1??g/ml, respectively, indicating effectiveness of these compounds against burn pathogens. These drugs were tested for cytotoxicity on cultured human keratinocytes using MTT cell viability assay. Results indicate that these drugs are nontoxic to cultured keratinocytes at the level required for bacterial killing. Since theses drugs are membrane active compounds it will be hard for bacteria to develop resistance and there is a great potential to be developed for clinical treatment.

AB  - Abstract? Brooke Army Medical Center isolated 25 highly antibiotic-resistant Acinetobacter ssp. (primarily A. baumannii) from wounded soldiers returning from Iraq. Concern about effective treatment of these organisms led our institution to begin investigating low-frequency ultrasound (LFU) as a method of increasing the effectiveness of antibiotics on A.baumannii in wound management. Studies have suggested that LFU applied in conjunction with antibiotics may increase their overall effectiveness. We hypothesize that combining antibiotics with LFU may be an effective method of wound management and that this combination may be synergistic in its overall effect. In this initial work, we wanted to determine if sonocation would have an effect on our organism of interest, A. baumannii. We selected several organisms, both gram positive and gram negative, that have been shown to be killed by sonocation (E. coli, S. aureus, and S. pyogenes) and added three highly resistant A. baumannii isolates. Bacterial death was measured by both colony counts after 24 hours of growth and acridine orange staining using a standard protocol. Colony counts were significantly reduced by sonocation. Furthermore, A.'baumannii colony counts were also greatly reduced by sonocation. Actual cell destruction was also visualized using acridine orange staining. Our data support the assertion that sonocation has an antibacterial effect on some bacteria, including A. baumannii. Our next step is to add antimicrobial agents and determine if their effectiveness can be increased by sonocation.

AB  - Hypertrophic scarring is a pathological process characterized by a fibroblastic hyperproliferation and by an excess of deposition of extracellular matrix components. Hypothesis of abnormalities in epidermal-dermal cross talk has been laid down to explain this pathology. To check this affirmation, we used a tissue-engineered model of self-assembly reconstructed skin in order to mimic interactions between dermal and epidermal cells in normal or pathological skin. We performed those skin equivalents with three dermal cell types : normal wound (Wmyo) or hypertrophic wound (Hmyo) myofibroblasts and normal skin fibroblasts (Fb). Epidermis was reconstructed with normal skin keratinocytes (NK), hypertrophic scars keratinocytes (HK), or without any keratinocytes. In the absence of epidermis, Hmyo formed a thicker dermis than Wmyo. When seeded with NK, the dermal thickness of Hmyo and Fb dermis was significantly reduced while that of Wmyo was increased. However, the presence of HK always induced thicker dermis formation than observed with NK. HK also increase the production of extracellular matrix and reduce its degradation in comparison with NK. In addition, HK have more influence on dermal cells proliferation than NK. In conclusion, HK may play a more important role on fibrosis development than NK. The keratinocytes have distinct secretory patterns depending on their skin source. Wmyo and Hmyo do not react the same way to the presence of keratinocytes. These observations strongly suggest that HK have a more important role on pathological fibrosis development by influencing dermal cells behavior. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an ubiquitous enzyme produced by different cell types. Previous reports have demonstrated ALP induction by extracellular matrix, ascorbic acid or IL-6. Using histochemical techniques, we evaluated the ex vivo activity of ALP in incisional and excisional acute wounds, chronic wounds, and keloids in animal and human models. We also compared in situ ALP activity with type I/III collagen levels using histological methods (Herovici technique). Results demonstrated that 1) during the first stage of acute wound healing the increase in ALP activity precedes high levels of type III collagen, meanwhile type I collagen diminishes. When ALP activity disappears, the proportion of type I/III collagen returns to normal. 2) ALP activity is almost null in chronic wounds, which are characterized by thick type I collagen fibers and some type III collagen throughout the tissue. However, when the wound is treated, ALP activity rises to maximum levels together with type III collagen, but type I collagen is absent. 3) In keloids ALP activity is also absent; however when the scar is treated with a proinflammatory cytokine downmodulator (collagen-polyvinylpyrrolidone) endogenous type I collagen diminishes, while type III collagen and ALP activity are increased. Based on the above results we suggest that ALP activity is an acute inflammation marker since the enzyme levels are increased in acute wounds but not in chronic inflammation processes. Nevertheless, when chronic lesions or scars are in the process of healing, the increase in ALP activity is clear. And as a result, we believe that treatments for chronic wounds or scars induce acute inflammation and consequently stimulate wound repair or fibrolysis. In conclusion, ALP activity is an important factor to be considered in acute and chronic wound repair and their healing process.

AB  - Abstract Background.? Because of disparate taxonomic arrays for classification, the American Academy of Pain Medicine has proposed categorizing pain on a neurobiologic basis as eudynia (nociceptive pain), Greek for ?good pain,? or maldynia (maladaptive pain), Greek for ?bad pain.? The latter has been viewed as maladaptive because it may occur in the absence of ongoing noxious stimuli and does not promote healing and repair. Objective.? To address recent findings on the pathogenesis of pain following neural injury and consider whether the development of maladaptive pain justifies its classification as a disease and to briefly discuss the scope of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches employed in patients with such pain. Methods.? English language reports on studies using human subjects were selected from a PubMed search of the literature from 1995 to August 2010 and from the Cochrane Library. Further information was obtained from Internet sites of medical specialty and other societies devoted to pain management. Results.? Neural damage to either the peripheral or central nervous system provokes multiple processes including peripheral and central sensitization, ectopic activity, neuronal cell death, disinhibition, altered gene expression, and abnormal sprouting and cellular connectivity. A series of neuro-immune interactions underlie many of these mechanisms. Imaging studies have shown that such damage is characterized by functional, structural, and chemical changes in the brain. Such pain is maladaptive in the sense that it occurs in the absence of ongoing noxious stimuli and does not promote healing and repair. Conclusion.? As defined, maldynia is a multidimensional process that may warrant consideration as a chronic disease not only affecting sensory and emotional processing but also producing an altered brain state based on both functional imaging and macroscopic measurements. However, the absolute clinical value of this definition is not established.

AB  - Background:? Bilayered cell therapy (BLCT) is a significant advancement in the field of wound healing. BLCT expresses multiple growth factors found in normal skin, and provides a biologically active matrix in chronic wounds. Antibiotic-resistant bacterium continues to be a major problem in chronic wounds. The use of appropriate topical antimicrobial agents could be one of the first steps in prevention of wound infection, although their use with BLCT is limited due to reported toxicity to cultured keratinocytes. Objectives:? This study was designed to see whether a topical antimicrobial agent is able to permeate through the BLCT and inhibits the growth of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA). Mupirocin was used because of its lack of toxicity to cultured keratinocytes. Methods:? MRSA (ATCC# 33591) strain was used for these studies. The entire surface of blood agar plates were covered with a high inoclum of MRSA. BLCT specimens were placed on the agar plates and mupirocin was then applied on the top surface. As a positive control, mupirocin was applied directly on the agar plate, while BLCT specimens alone were used as negative control. The plates were subsequently incubated for 24 hours after which the zones of inhibition were assessed. Results:? Placing mupirocin on top of BLCT gave a 41.9?±?17.2?mm inhibition zone diameter. Although it was smaller than the inhibition zone diameter produced by direct administration of mupirocin (26.3?±?9.4?mm), this difference was not statistically significant. BLCT by itself did not create a zone of inhibition. Conclusion:? Mupirocin is able to permeate BLCT and inhibit the bacterial growth underneath it. This study may have important clinical implications.

AB  - Various matrices containing both synthetic or natural polymers are currently used for local regional drug delivery to a number of disease locations such as chronic cutaneous wounds, joints, bone, muscle, and nerves. Insert Therapeutics has developed a novel synthetic matrix which consists of a copolymer of ?-cyclodextrin and polyethylene-glycol (PEG). Addition of di- or multifunctionalized adamantane-PEG molecules results in noncovalent cross-linking through inclusion complex formation. The resulting hydrogel showed rheological characteristics amenable to topical application or local-regional injection into a variety of tissues (Bellocq et al. (2004) Bioconjug Chem 15(6): 1201?1211). This matrix was shown to be biocompatible, allowing for cellular growth and migration in vitro. It also allowed for efficient delivery of an adenovirus gene therapy vector to dermal fibroblast cells. In vivo, the matrix demonstrated efficient delivery of biotherapeutics such as recombinant adenovirus and non-viral gene therapy vectors after intradermal injection. The matrix was well tolerated and was as efficient as collagen in promoting wound healing when an adenoviral gene therapy vector expressing PDGF-bb was delivered to cutaneous wounds of diabetic mice. The matrix can additionally be modified to incorporate therapeutic small molecules, peptides, or proteins, either through inclusion complex formation or chemical linkage. Using biodegradable linker chemistry, the release rate of covalently attached molecules can be controlled. The cyclodextrin-PEG matrix is therefore an attractive alternative to existing matrices that is biocompatible, biodegradable, tunable with regard to its physicochemical properties, and can be designed to deliver multiple therapeutic agents to a variety of tissues in a controlled fashion.

AB  - Introduction:? Open wounds following oncologic reresection of skin cancer of the hand can be problematic from a soft tissue reconstructive perspective. First, these wounds must often await definitive coverage until permanent negative margin clearance is obtained. This results in the morbidity of chronic painful dressing changes and possible infection. Secondly, for defects of the first web space, the reconstructive options are often limited to skin grafting which can yield functional hazards with contracted healing. Acellular dermis has been proposed as a biomechanical scaffold for subsequent skin grafting. Hypothesis:? We proposed to use acellular dermis for wounds stemming from reresection of skin cancers of the first web space to: 1)? obviate dressing changes until permanent histology was confirmed 2)? provide a soft tissue platform that enhances subsequent skin graft take and healing and ameliorates potential graft contracture Methods:? The resected wound area of two patients, 11???5 and 5???4?cm in size, were transiently covered with acellular dermis in the first stage. After confirmation of final histologic clearance of tumor at the margins, split thickness skin graft was placed on the granulating wound bed. Subsequent clinical examination and DASH questionnaires were used to assess outcome. Results:? After 6 months, wounds had healed with good cosmetic result. No contracture of the web space was noted. Average DASH score was 20.5 and no recurrences were noted. Conclusion:? Our observations suggest that acellular dermis is a useful adjunct for covering wounds of the hand, especially for functionally important locations such as the first dorsal web space.

AB  - Background:? Acinetobacter baumannii has recently emerged as an important hospital-acquired pathogen, especially in surgery, burn, and intensive care units. Due to its ability to develop resistance to antimicrobials, wound infection with A. baumannii is difficult to treat, and can lead to septicemia and even death. Use of appropriate topical antimicrobial agents in these circumstances could be one of the first steps in prevention of A. baumannii wound infection. Objectives:? In this study, we will discuss the in vitro effects of seven common topical antimicrobial creams and dressings on A. baumannii. Methods:? A. Baumannii ATCC# 6919 was subjected to sensitivity tests against mupirocin, silver sulfadiazine, mafenide acetate, a double antibiotic combination of polymyxin and bacitracin, a triple antibiotic combination of Neomycin, bacitracin and polymyxin, and two silver-containing dressings. Zones of inhibition were measured after 24 hours incubation period. Results and Conclusion:? Of the evaluated antimicrobial agents, mafenide acetate was the most efficacious followed by mupirocin, triple and double antibiotic combinations in decreasing order. The silver-containing dressings yielded a lesser zone of inhibition as compared to the previously mentioned, and no zone of inhibition was observed using silver sulfadiazine. Further in vivo studies on the effect of antimicrobial agents against A. Baumannii are necessary to substantiate these findings and determine the potential clinical relevance of these therapies.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a major role in recruiting and activating inflammatory cells, inducing angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and collagen synthesis, all processes essential to wound healing. However, the same mediators have been implicated in pulmonary and hepatic fibrosis, vascular occlusion, and necrotic tissue damage. We have previously shown that hyperbaric oxygen caused a prolonged elevation of VEGF and delayed wound healing in a rat model of tissue ischemia. In this study we examine the effect of the ROS scavenger, n-acetylcysteine (NAC), on ischemic wound healing. NAC is a virtually nontoxic free radical scavenger that has been used in many experimental studies to block ROS-mediated signaling. Methods:? Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent creation of the ischemic flap previously validated by this laboratory. This model provides two ischemic and two nonischemic excisional wounds. Rats were treated daily with HBO for 90 minutes at 2.4?atm, HBO plus 150?mg/kg NAC intraperitoneal, or control (neither HBO nor NAC). Wounds were analyzed for surface area, lactate, and VEGF. Results:? The HBO/NAC-treated animals had markedly impaired healing of their ischemic wounds at day 7 (0.105?±?.005?cm vs. 0.068?±?.002?cm for ctl and 0.064?±?.006 for HBO) and a twofold elevation of VEGF (120?pg/mg protein vs. 60?pg/mg protein). Lactate levels were not altered by NAC treatment and non-ischemic wounds showed no difference in healing, lactate, or VEGF. Conclusion:? Reactive oxygen species are required for wound healing. Our initial hypothesis was that the delay in wound closure with HBO treatment was due to excess ROS and that NAC would improve healing. The finding of elevated VEGF and delayed wound healing in the presence of a potent free radical scavenger suggests that blocking ROS signaling prevents the normal mitogenic response to VEGF. Additional studies to examine the VEGF receptor and tyrosine kinase activation will further elucidate the mechanism of ROS signaling in response to HBO treatment.

AB  - We have previously reported that local injection of small doses of long-acting insulin-zinc suspension maintained sufficiently high insulin concentration in the wound fluid and accelerated the healing. The present experiment was to measure the rates of cell proliferation (reflected by DNA synthesis) and protein metabolism in the wound. These are the underlying metabolic processes responsible for the healing. Partial thickness skin donor wound was created on the back and indwelling catheters were placed in the carotid artery and jugular vein in adult rabbits under general anesthesia. The wound was covered with Aquaphor gauze, OpSite membrane, and surgical gauze. On day 7 after wounding, the wound was either injected with 0.2 units of insulin-Zn, Zn alone, or no injection; stable isotopes were infused into the jugular vein catheter in conscious rabbits for measurement of DNA synthesis, protein synthesis and breakdown in the wound. The local insulin-Zn injection raised wound insulin concentration to 168?±?39??U/ml. In contrast, in the control and Zn groups wound insulin concentrations were below the detectable level. The local injection of insulin-Zn suspension increased (p?=?0.03) DNA synthesis in the wound with minor changes in blood glucose concentration which did not require exogenous glucose replacement. In the Zn group, whereas the rate of DNA synthesis tended to increase (p?=?0.051 vs. control), the protein net balance (synthesis ? breakdown) was lower (p?<?0.05) than those in the control and insulin-Zn (Table 1). We conclude that local injection of a small dose (0.2 units insulin) long-acting insulin-Zn suspension stimulated wound DNA synthesis without major systemic side effects thereby providing an effective and safe approach to accelerate wound healing. Although local Zn injection might also stimulate wound DNA synthesis, the benefit on the healing process was limited by decreased net protein deposition. 1 Wound DNA and protein metabolism.
