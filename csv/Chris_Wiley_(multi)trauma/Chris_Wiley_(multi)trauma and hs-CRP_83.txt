AB  - Sepsis remains a common and serious complication of major burn injury and currently accounts for over 54% of deaths in burn patients. Burns have been associated with high levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines and immunosuppression which promotes systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis, for which no effective treatment is currently available. Defensins and cathelicidins, a family of cationic naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides, are considered important components of the innate immune system as they play a major role in the body?s defense by inhibiting several bacteria, fungi and enveloped viruses. Our prior studies using RT-PCR and fluorescence deconvolution microscopy suggest decreased expression of human ? defensin 2 (HBD2) in burn wounds. In this study we have characterized cathelicidin (LL-37) protein levels using in representative skin samples of deep partial and full thickness burns and in unburned skin. Our results show that in unburned skin, the majority of LL-37 was located in the malphigian layer and was concentrated on the stratum corneum as well as colocalized with sweat ducts. In burned skin, in which the epidermis was destroyed, this pattern of LL-37 was absent. The surviving dermal and subcutaneous layers revealed LL-37 presence in very high concentrations colocalized with sweat duct epithelia. The result of these studies will contribute to an understanding of the role of antimicrobial peptides in the pathophysiology of burn injury, associated immunosuppression, and sepsis.

AB  - Diabetic wounds are characterized by disruption of the normal wound repair responses, particularly at the inflammatory and proliferative stages. Inadequate levels of growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), play a significant role in the impaired healing of these wounds. PDGF is a potent mitogen and chemotactic agent, and is released from platelet alpha-granules during the acute inflammatory phase of wound healing. It has been shown to promote the deposition of collagen and granulation tissue, and improves healing in diabetic animals. Although previous studies have shown some success with topically applied PDGF, results in clinical practice have been moderate. In this study, we investigated whether gene therapy with lentiviral vectors carrying the gene for PDGF can improve wound healing in an animal model. Full thickness 2?cm???2?cm dermal wounds were created on the dorsae of genetically diabetic db/db mice. Lentiviral vectors containing the human PDGF-beta gene (lenti-PDGF) were injected into the wound margins and along the wound base. Control experiments were performed using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injections. Mice were sacrificed after 21 days, and wound tissues were harvested for histological analyses. Lenti-PDGF-treated animals demonstrated significantly smaller residual epithelial gaps compared to PBS controls (0.77 +/? 0.07?cm vs. 1.22 +/? 0.30?cm; P?<?0.001), as well as a greater degree of wound closure (85 +/? 3% vs. 57 +/? 22%; P?<?0.05). Lentiviral gene therapy with PDGF is effective in promoting wound healing in genetically diabetic animals, and warrants further investigation.

AB  - Skin wound healing requires temporally and spatially coordinated motility of multiple skin cell types. The limited success of current skin wound care is due to lack of understanding about how the healing processes begin, progress, and complete. One of the most dramatic environmental changes in an acute wound is the transition from plasma to serum. The cells in the wound come into contact with serum, instead of a filtrate of plasma, for the first time. We report here that this transition differentially regulates the migration of various skin cell types. Plasma promotes dermal fibroblast and endothelia cell, but not keratinocyte and melanocyte, motility. In contrast, serum selectively promotes keratinocyte motility and inhibits fibroblast and endothelial cell motility. The key regulators are the increased transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in serum and the distinct TGF-beta receptor (I, II and III) profiles in different cell types. TGF-beta selectively inhibits fibroblast and endothelial cell, but not keratinocyte and melanocyte, migration. Neutralization of TGF-beta function in serum eliminates the differential effects between serum and plasma. Manipulations of the TGF-beta receptor profiles in the cells, especially TGF-beta receptor II and III, convert TGF-beta-insensitive cell types to sensitive cell types and vice versa, and their responses to plasma and serum. This is the first study that reveals a molecular mechanism for coordinating multiple skin cell-type motility in wounds.

AB  - Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-B) is a potent cell mitogen and chemotactic signal involved in normal wound healing. PDGF-B is present at decreased levels in diabetic wounds and has been shown to improve wound healing when applied in a topical form. However, clinical results with topical PDGF in the treatment of diabetic wounds have been equivocal. In this study, we investigated whether application of PDGF-B via gene therapy can effectively promote wound healing in the diabetic environment in an animal model. Retroviral vectors carrying the gene for human PDGF-B were constructed using the LNCX virus and the G418 resistance gene for selection (LN-PDGF-B), and transduced into mouse dermal fibroblasts. LN-PDGF-B transduced fibroblasts were seeded into alginate hydrogel scaffolds at a concentration of 25???106 cells/implant and implanted into 2?cm???2?cm full thickness excisional dermal wounds created on the dorsae of genetically diabetic db/db mice. At 21 days, animals treated with LN-PDGF-B transduced cells suspended in alginate hydrogel demonstrated a significantly smaller epithelial gap (0.97 +/? 0.34?cm) than animals receiving untransduced mouse dermal fibroblasts alone (1.44 +/? 0.37?cm; P?<?0.05) or animals receiving dermal fibroblasts transduced with LNCX viral vector alone (1.40 +/? 0.20?cm; P?<?0.01). These results suggest tissue-engineered retroviral gene therapy with PDGF-B specifically promotes diabetic wound healing and may yield advances in the effective treatment of diabetic wounds.

AB  - The role of proteases in chronic wounds has been the subject of many investigations in recent years. These studies have reported biochemical differences between chronic and acute wound fluids and have shown that elevated levels of proteases, in particular the matrix metalloproteinases are abundant in chronic wounds. While this has led to the hypothesis that the chronic wound environment is hostile and not conducive to wound repair, it is still unknown whether this is due to a direct or indirect defect in protease regulation or their inhibitors. We hypothesize that an excess of proteases, specifically the serine proteases present in chronic wounds, are primarily responsible for this hostile wound environment. These proteases degrade endogenous growth factors, reducing their efficacy and delaying healing. In this study, fluid and tissue from chronic and acute wounds were collected over a 24-hour period. Using ELISA, samples were assessed for protease activity (specifically elastase and typsin-like enzymes), their inhibitors and growth factors. Our results show that serine proteases, predominantly elastase, were significantly elevated in the chronic wound fluids. The serpins designed to control these proteases were not up-regulated when compared to the acute controls, resulting in excessive proteolytic activity. An increase in serine protease production without an increase in their serpins is thought to result in a reduction in growth factors, an effect, which was also observed in the chronic wound samples. This work indicates that there is an imbalance in the ratio of inhibitor to enzyme, due to an up regulation of protease production in chronic wounds. We also conclude that misregulation of serine proteases may be responsible for the observed excessive degradation of the extracellular matrix and growth factors in these chronic wounds.

AB  - Clinically the outcome of pressure ulcers is predicted by the severity/stage of the ulcer, patient health and health care options. These factors, however, cannot be used to accurately evaluate the prognosis and healing in these ulcers, thus delaying any required change in the treatment plan. Techniques are needed that can help in the assessment of healing and improve the clinical management of these ulcers. Studies of tissue health such as angiogenesis, by measuring blood flow in the ulcer at different time points, has been examined as a way to evaluate the state of healing ulcers. Although the Laser Doppler Perfusion Imager (LDPI) has been used to assess various wounds, there is a need to validate it as a predictor of wound healing. The standard clinical outcome parameter for skin wounds has been time to heal. To validate the LDPI as predictor of healing, however, a measure that gives periodic feedback such as healing rate is a more useful outcome measure. The goal of this study therefore was to determine a protocol for the LDPI and evaluate its ability to predict healing in pressure ulcers. Previous studies have indicated that perfusion values obtained after heat stress may reflect the blood flow more accurately than absolute perfusion values. It was hypothesized that the difference in the blood perfusion after heat provocation is expected to correlate with the healing rate. The selected heat provocation (increase of 20?°F) was evaluated on five spinal cord injured pressure ulcer patients. The LDPI assessment and healing rate measurements were done weekly for 5 weeks. Preliminary results suggest a relationship between the difference in the perfusion and the healing rate for the following week. Further studies will be necessary to determine the exact relationship. This tool has the potential to play a critical role in the clinical management of pressure ulcers as well as other skin ulcers. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - It is expected that by 2030, 20% of the American population will be over 65 years of age. Forty percent of Americans are expected to die in nursing homes in the near future. Pressure ulcer prevalence rates of 13% are reported at long-term care units but healing rates are infrequently published from these settings. Current wound protocols fail to consider patients goals of care. The possibility that a wound will not heal is rarely communicated to the patient or family. Palliative care focuses on the relief of suffering and improvement in the quality of life. It can be the sole focus of care or can be delivered parallel to aggressive curative treatments. This presentation describes a case history of an unfortunate 40-year-old patient suffering from multiple sclerosis who developed a stage 4 pressure ulcer during a pregnancy. Postpartum, the patient underwent flap coverage of the wound. Her MS worsened, the flap broke down and a family conference resulted in the decision to provide palliative wound care and involve hospice. Wound care continued with a silver impregnated absorptive dressings and ultraviolet light therapy to control bioburden, diminish odor and dressing frequency, which improved quality of life. Palliative wound protocols will be reviewed along with details of the above-mentioned case. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Aim:? To determine the viability/effects of incorporating Negative Pressure Wound Therapy ( NPWT )/V.A.C.? Therapy as an adjunct in the treatment of Pyoderma Gangrenosum. Material and Methods:? A 74-year-old white female presented with clinical evidence of Pyoderma Gangrenosum (PG). The wound exhibited pathergy and therefore aggressive debridement remained contraindicated. The patient applied topical Elidel cream to the periwound. With meticulous wound management, the lesion remained free of infection. Clinicians utilized various systemic treatment regimes including Minocycline 100?mg twice daily, Dapsone 50?mg daily, Cyclosporine 150?mg twice daily, and ultimately Infliximab 5?mg/kg every 2 months. The latter drug created a significant positive response; however, the wound continued to ?wax and wane.? Researchers began NPWT/V.A.C.? Therapy to facilitate granulation tissue, epithelization, and ultimate wound closure. Results:? The researchers observed dramatic improvement in wound dimensions, wound contracture, and granulation tissue with the addition of NPWT/V.A.C.? therapy. Conclusions:? NPWT/V.A.C.? Therapy appears to augment healing in a patient with Pyoderma Gangrenosum and may be useful as adjunctive therapy. Acknowledgments:? KCI?, San Antonio, TX

AB  - Background:? Platelets are a rich source of proteins and growth factors that are instrumental in the initiation and modulation of tissue repair. The clinical use of crude platelet preparations has been around for decades. However, the use of autologous platelet gel (APG) for the treatment of wounds has become familiar practice in only the past 10 years. Platelet gels have been associated with accelerated vascular ingrowth, increased fibroblastic proliferation, and accelerated collagen production.x3 Objective:? The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of APG using a porcine wound healing model. Methods:? Platelet rich plasma (PRP) was obtained using a fully automated, easy-to-use devise. APG was created from PRP and autologous thrombin. Deep partial thickness wounds were created on specific pathogen-free pigs. Wounds were either treated with APG and covered with a polyurethane dressing, were treated only with a polyurethane dressing, or were left untreated. Wounds were assessed for epithelization using a well-established salt-split technique. Results:? Wounds treated with APG enhanced the rate of epithelization as compared to both polyurethane and untreated controls. Conclusions:? This study shows that an autologous platelet rich gel can stimulate and enhance epithelization of deep partial thickness wounds. Additional preclinical and clinical studies that examine mechanisms of action are warranted.

AB  - Hypothesis:? The use of Vacuum Assisted Closure (VAC) therapy will stimulate the development of angiogenesis in the subjacent tissues underlying and surrounding the wound base to a greater degree than can be achieved with standard wound healing efforts. Study Background:? The presence of tissue ischemia and hypoxia due to compromised arterial blood flow is a primary factor compromising wound healing. Wounds that are compromised by impaired angiogenesis will have poor blood supply and are unlikely to progress through the stages of healing in an orderly and timely fashion. The VAC is a subatmospheric pressure system utilizing medical grade polyurethane foam wound dressing that is fitted at the bedside to the appropriate size for each patient?s wound, and then covered with an adhesive drape to create an airtight seal. The VAC enhances wound healing by stimulating granulation tissue. The etiology of this granulation is thought to be increased blood flow to the wound base and stimulation of angiogenesis, but the physiologic tissue changes due to VAC therapy that lead to the development of angiogenesis has not been proven or documented. A recent clinical observation demonstrated angiographic evidence of subadjacent angiogenesis in a patient with a wound that was managed successfully with VAC therapy. However, to date no randomized controlled trials have been performed to document wound angiogenesis. We propose that subatmospheric pressure dressings applied to lower extremity ulcers will promote angiogenesis more effectively than moist wound therapy dressings.

AB  - Hypertrophic scars are a resultant of a fibroproliferative disorder observed at the time of the wound healing of large surface, like burns. In normal wound, the process of healing begins with the invasion in the wound of microvascular cells and by the migration of myofibroblasts to form the granulation tissue. There, myofibroblasts play an important role since they synthesize the extracellular matrix and are responsible for the contraction of the wound. At the end of the healing process, the myofibroblasts disappear by apoptosis via unknown stimuli. In the case of hypertrophics scars, there is persistence of a high density of cells and collagen in comparison with normal granulation tissue. Scientists associate this disorder with a problem in the regulation of apoptosis. Our hypothesis is that endothelial cells play an important role in the persistence of myofibroblasts in wound healing. We have compared the apoptotic rates of human myofibroblasts from normal wounds (Wmyo) with those from hypertrophic scars (Hmyo) when exposed with supernatants from microvascular cells isolated from normal skins (CEMV) or hypertrophic scars (CEMVH). The first results showed a significative reduction of apoptosis for Hmyo while Wmyo were not found to respond to the microvascular supernatant. There were, however, no difference in the apoptotic rates of both populations of cells when exposed to CEMV or CEMVH supernatants. These results suggest that endothelial cells secrete one or many factors that inhibit Hmyo apoptosis, thus preventing the disappearance of those cells and inducing the formation of hypertrophic scars. We hope that a better understanding of the mechanisms implicated in the formation of hypertrophic scars will open the way to new treatments. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - Background:? Preclinical animal studies with a fetal bovine dermal collagen matrix suggest that fibroblasts quickly populate the material. At the same time there is a rapid ingrowth of new blood vessels. In short, the matrix quickly becomes living tissue. Experience with bioengineered skin constructs and porcine small intestinal submucosal products suggest that the application of a scaffold or matrix may play a role in the healing of venous leg ulcerations in humans. Methods:? A fetal bovine dermal collagen matrix (Primatrix) was applied to patients with long-standing venous leg ulcerations. Histologic examination pre and post application with trichrome staining was employed to differentiate matrix from native collagen. Comparisons between animal and human ulcers were made grossly and histologically. Results:? In all patients there was rapid formation of granulation tissue with a decrease in the depth of the wound. This was followed by epithelialization and wound closure. The stimulatory effect persisted for approximately 1 month after which time a second matrix was applied. In contrast to the animal study the grafts exhibited ?take? in only one of our patients. Histologic examination in both animals and humans suggests a stimulation of native collagen production as well as an initial incorporation of the Primatrix into the wound bed. Conclusion:? Primatrix has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical studies and in a series of patients with venous leg ulcerations. The product may function as a scaffold for the ingrowth of cells essential to wound healing. Further investigation in a randomized controlled study setting is recommended. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - The treatment of venous ulcers must start with compression and if the ankle brachial index is greater than 0.8 high compression bandages can be applied. Despite edema control, there are a number of venous ulcers that do not heal at the expected rate. Patients with venous ulcers of greater than 4 weeks duration were treated with a prolonged release absorptive nanocrystalline silver dressing (Acticoat 7) under the 4 layer bandage, Profore for 12 weeks, or until healing. Biopsies were obtained from the ulcer base at week 0 for histology and bacterial burden. Duplicate biopsies for quantitative bacteriology were performed with one submitted whole and the second bisected into superficial and deep components. The paired biopsies were then repeated after a median of 6.5 weeks (range 2 to 12 weeks). The histological specimens were examined by the histopathologist (SR). Inflammatory infiltrates were identified in the superficial, middle and deep segments of the biopsies. Acute infiltrates were identified through the concentration of neutrophils and chronic infiltrates by the presence of lymphocytes. Each biopsy and each segment was graded for infiltrates on a four point semi quantitative score. A total of 15 patients (9 male, and 6 female) were enrolled into the study. The median age was 63 years (range 30?83 years). The median duration of current ulceration was 17.3 weeks (range 4 weeks to 11 years) and the median ulcer area was 4.8?cm2(range 1.8?43.9?cm2). The median exposure to Acticoat 7 was 82 days (range 8?86 days). There were 12 sets of paired biopsies that were analyzed. There was a statistically significant reduction (p?=?0.0114) in the log10(total bacterial count) between the baseline and final biopsies (median 4.48 and 3.00, respectively). Four patients healed, 8 patients continued to the end of the 12-week study period and three patients were discontinued early. For all patients, the median percentage reduction in ulcer area was 94.4% and the median final ulcer area was 0.4?cm2. Analysis of the histology and bacteriology data demonstrated that the presence of a high neutrophilic infiltrate in skin biopsies was associated with high bacterial counts (superficial compartment of the quantitative biopsies) at week 4 and delayed healing (p?=?0.037). In the week 0 biopsy, increased lymphocytic infiltrates within the superficial and middle segments were associated with accelerated healing in the first 4 weeks (p?=?0.26 and 0.09). The nanocrystalline silver dressing has demonstrated an anti-bacterial and permissive but selective anti-inflammatory action allowing lymphocytic infiltrates to increase associated with an accelerated reduction in ulcer size.
