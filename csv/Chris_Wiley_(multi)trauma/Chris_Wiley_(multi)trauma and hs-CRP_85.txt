AB  - In persons with venous ulcers and an absence of arterial disease, high compression as exemplified by the four layer bandage (Profore) has been demonstrated to be effective by a meta-analysis of existing studies. Despite optimized compression, some venous ulcers do not heal at the expected rate and persistent inflammation or infection may delay or prevent healing. We report the results of a case series that demonstrates an ionized silver dressing with prolonged release of nanocrystalline crystals (Acticoat 7) can decrease bacterial burden and accelerate healing in venous ulcers not healing at the expected rate. Patients with venous ulcers were treated with a prolonged release absorptive nanocrystalline silver dressing (Acticoat 7) under a four layer bandage (Profore) for 12 weeks, or until healing. The primary efficacy objective measured the effect of the silver dressing on the wound microflora. Biopsies of the wounds were taken at baseline and after treatment with the silver dressing (Acticoat 7) and were analyzed for the bacterial species and number of bacteria present. In addition, serum silver levels were assessed at baseline, weeks 4, 8 and week 12 or final assessment. A total of 15 patients (9 male, and 6 female) were enrolled into the study. The median age was 63 years (range 30?83 years). The median duration of current ulceration was 17.3 weeks (range 4 weeks to 11 years) and the median ulcer area was 4.8?cm2(range 1.8?43.9?cm2). The median exposure to Acticoat 7 was 82 days (range 8?86 days). There was a statistically significant reduction (p?=?0.0114) in the log10(total bacterial count) between the baseline and final biopsies (median 4.48 and 3.00, respectively). Four patients healed, 8 patients continued to the end of the 12-week study period and three patients were discontinued early. Of those patients who did not heal, 4 had more than a 94% reduction in wound area by the end of the 12-week study period. For all patients, the median percentage reduction in ulcer area was 94.4% and the median final ulcer area was 0.4?cm2. Statistical analysis showed a significant increase (p?=?0.054) in serum silver concentration during the treatment period. At baseline, prior to the silver dressing treatment (Acticoat 7), the median silver concentration was 0.3??g/L (range: 0.20?1.90??g/L). The median within patient change from baseline serum silver concentration was an increase of 0.15??g/L (range: ?0.3?2.8??g/L). Although this small increase was observed it was not considered clinically significant. This study illustrates the use of prolonged release nanocrystalline silver dressing to decrease the bacterial burden of chronic venous ulcers not healing at the expected rate.

AB  - Often chronic wounds have an increased bacterial burden that can impair healing without the classical clinical signs of infection. Silver dressings may provide an alternative topical method to control bacterial burden. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 2?4 weeks therapy with the Silver Containing Hydrofiber? dressing on quantitative bacterial burden and clinical improvement in chronic wounds not healing at the expected rate. This was a single centre, four-armed study which included a total of 30 patients with diabetic foot ulcers, leg ulcers, pressure ulcers and miscellaneous wounds that did not fit into any of the above categories. Patients had a baseline quantitative bacterial biopsy and this was repeated at weeks 2 to 4. The wound size was recorded along with a semi quantitative estimate of exudate and the periwound temperatures. Repeat measurements were performed at the follow-up visits and the decrease in wound size calculated. The underlying cause of the ulceration was be treated and corrected. This was followed by application of silver containing hydrofiber? dressing. There was a significant delay in healing of the leg ulcers associated with increased bacterial burden in the quantitative biopsy bacterial burden results at week 0 and healing at week 2. (p?=?0.01). Other subgroups had a similar association that did not reach statistical significance. The presence of an increased exudate in the leg ulcers at week two was associated with delayed healing at week 4 (p?=?0.05). There was also a significant increase in skin surface temperature of the surrounding skin with an increased quantitative bacterial biopsy of the deep wound compartment for venous, diabetic neurotrophic foot ulcers and pressure ulcers with p values of 0.05, 0.01 and 0.01 respectively. There was no significant decrease in exudate or increased healing of the wounds with the application of the silver hydrofiber dressing in this difficult to heal population. The population studied in this case series had increased bacterial burden in the deep compartment as measured with increased exudate and or an increased temperature of the periwound skin. These patients have an increased bacterial burden in the deep wound compartment that does not respond to topical ionized silver in the dressing studied.

AB  - How wound dressings may act locally to aid chronic wound healing is poorly understood. Along with an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of nonhealing wounds such as venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers, and the realization that these ulcers exhibit a high degree of inflammation, models have been developed linking the disease etiology and the visible ulcer. Furthermore, these models have suggested ways in which present therapeutic regimens, such as compression, aid healing. However, little focus has been placed on understanding how locally applied wound dressings aid in the overall healing response in the context of elevated inflammation. Here, we propose that if wound dressings have the correct combination of novel materials and physical characteristics they may provide effective management of the damaging local factors (i.e., proteinases and/or bacteria), thereby promoting a local environment supportive of healing. For example, the management of damaging wound exudates, limiting its exposure to the wound bed and surrounding skin, reduces the irritant effects of these exudates, leading to a reduction in the localized stimulation of inflammation. A better understanding of local environment and wound dressing interactions will help in the development of more effective wound dressings in the future.

AB  - We have previously shown that resident fibroblasts from human chronic wounds are phenotypically abnormal, displaying an impaired response to TGF-beta 1, decreased TGF-beta Type II receptor expression, and decreased phosphorylation of Smad2, Smad3, and p42/44 MAPK. We now report that these human cells delay healing by approximately 30% when implanted in mouse incisional wounds and in a dorsal flap model. These new findings point to the need for the transplantation of new healthy cells in human chronic wounds. Bioengineered living skin constructs can deliver new cells to chronic wounds, at least for a limited period of time. However, most available bioengineered skin constructs consist of already differentiated allogeneic cells, which do not allow for the possibility of engraftment and reconstitution of wound structures. Recently, in a preliminary report, we have shown that autologous bone marrow-derived cells can dramatically enhance the healing of recalcitrant chronic wounds when all other treatments have failed. Our present efforts are now focused on characterizing the bone marrow cells involved in this stimulation of wound healing and in developing better ways for their topical delivery to the wound. Here we present evidence that a fibrin construct may be an ideal way of applying bone marrow-derived cells to human chronic wounds. Autologous bone marrow cells are allowed to grow in culture under conditions favoring the survival and proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), as shown by surface markers and functional studies. This usually requires two weeks after bone marrow harvesting. The cellular component is then placed in a fibrinogen solution which, when simultaneously combined with thrombin through a CO2 driven flow, delivers a fine cell-containing fibrin polymer film to the wound. In vitro and in vivo experiments, both in mouse models and in human wounds, show the feasibility of this approach.

AB  - Purpose:? The purpose of this study was to determine the current use of wet-to-dry dressings as the principal wound care modality ordered by health care providers. In addition, this study describes the types of wounds wet-to-dry dressings are currently used for, the specialty of health care providers most likely to order these dressings, and associated data that indicates whether or not the clinical condition of the wound warrants the use of wet-to-dry dressing for mechanical debridement. Method:? This descriptive study involved a retrospective chart review of 202 home health and HMO case managed patients with open wounds One hundred and two HMO charts were reviewed; only 74 had sufficient data documented. One hundred and sixty-one home health charts were reviewed; only 128 were appropriate for data collection (closed incisions, drainage tubes, ostomies, and those charts where more than six items on the data collection sheet were not documented in the chart, were not used). The data was analyzed using SPSS. Findings:? This study suggests that the current use of wet-to-dry dressings is over 41% of all principal wound care modalities, followed by enzymatic (7.43%) and dry gauze (6.93%). The majority of wet-to-dry dressings ordered are for surgical wounds (69%), followed by neuropathic ulcers (10%) and pressure ulcers (5.9%). Furthermore, this study suggests that general surgeons are most likely to order wet-to-dry dressings (38%). Data also indicated that in over 78.6% of wounds treated with wet-to-dry dressings, mechanical debridement was not indicated (the percent of granulating tissue in the wound bed was?>?75%). In only 3.5% of wounds treated with wet-to-dry dressings was mechanical debridement possibly indicated by the amount of nonviable tissue in the wound bed. Discussion:? Clinicians need to be involved in research that will lead to evidenced based clinical practice and standardized wound care. The scientific literature suggests that wet-to-dry dressings are not evidenced based, but are detrimental to the granulating wound bed, painful, costly, and one of the least effective methods of debridement available today.

AB  - Background:? The human forearm biopsy model is employed by the Wound Healing Cooperative Group to evaluate the effect of novel agents on acute wounds. Bismuth Subgallate/Borneal (Suile) is a new product with FDA permission for the treatment of partial thickness wounds. However, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that Suile may be effective in the treatment of full thickness wounds because of its antimicrobial, hemostatic and antiinflammatory properties. Methods:? In our randomized, investigator-blinded study, 20 normal healthy volunteers underwent two 6?mm full-thickness skin biopsies on the flexor surface of each forearm (two wounds per subject). Biopsy sites were randomly assigned to control (daily bacitracin) or to the treatment arm (daily Suile). The wounds were examined, measured by digital planimetry, and photographed daily until complete healing was achieved. Adverse events and pain levels were monitored. Healing velocity and time-to-complete closure were determined. Results:? The forearm biopsy model allowed direct quantitative and qualitative comparisons of wound healing outcomes achieved by the Suile regimen versus bacitracin alone. Subject compliance was excellent. The conduct of the study was further facilitated by the use of handheld electronic documentation. Conclusion:? The forearm biopsy model has several advantages: It allows for a direct comparison of topical agents in a controlled fashion, studies can be conducted rapidly with good patient compliance and it allows investigators to gain firsthand experience with products prior to embarking on large clinical trials in chronic wounds.

AB  - Neuropathic ulcers represent a significant cause of morbitity for diabetics in the United States. Diabetic wounds are notoriously difficult to resolve. Treatment options are limited due in part to the lack of knowledge about the molecular events that regulate successful resolution of wounds. To identify differences between normal and diabetic gene regulation in wounds, we examined the level of expression of 12,000 genes in granulation tissue and wound-edge epithelium in normal animals and in an experimental model of diabetes following induction of full thickness skin injuries. Full thickness injuries in diabetic mice were characterized in part by altered regulation of structural genes and genes that regulate energy metabolism and utilization. The energy cycle contributes backbone structures for the synthesis of a variety of amino acids, the molecular building blocks essential for wound repair. A direct consequence of a diminished ability to efficiently exploit energy supplies would be decreased availability of regulatory and structural proteins necessary for efficient healing in diabetic wounds. We have successfully enhanced healing in diabetic wounds by treatment with the angiotensin II peptide NorLeu3A(1?7). NorLeu3A(1?7) accelerates healing of full thickness injuries in diabetic mice. While NorLeu3A(1?7) enhances healing by accelerating collagen deposition and reepithelialization, gene array studies show that NorLeu3A(1?7) acts locally within the wound site by altering gene expression within the granulation tissue. Specifically at day 7 after injury, NorLeu3A(1?7) reduced the expression of MMP genes and increase the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism. Supported by PHS grant NIAMS 2 R44 AR47481

AB  - MIST ultrasound, a recently FDA-cleared noncontact ultrasound therapy, was utilized prospectively in an IRB-approved trial for the treatment of recalcitrant wounds of various etiologies. Twenty-nine wounds from 23 patients were studied. Inclusion criteria included wounds greater than 4 weeks duration with no evidence of clinical improvement (>15% area reduction) over the prior 2 weeks before enrollment. The wounds were required to be free from clinical signs of infection. After an initial debridement and wash-out period, patients were treated 3 times a week with MIST for 4 minute treatment applications. Dressing regimens were left up to the investigator as dictated by wound conditions. The primary endpoint is complete healing. Data will be presented looking at MIST-derived healing, as defined by complete healing using MIST therapy all the way to closure. MIST-assisted healing, as defined by MIST therapy for wound bed preparation followed by an alternative means of closure will also be presented. ?Overall healing? defined by the combination of the two prior groups will complete the outcomes report, as this reflects a more ?real-world? clinical application for the technology. Wound dynamics, Kaplan Meier survival plots and laser Doppler imaging estimations of angiogenesis will all be presented. Acknowledgment:?

AB  - Inappropriate control of the expression and function of the components of the TGF-? signaling pathway has been implicated in impaired wound healing and abnormal scarring. Factors that have been shown to have profound effects on skin homeostasis and wound healing include steroids and oxygen tension. These agents may exert their effects (at least in part) on the skin and wound healing by modulating TGF-? action. To identify steroids and oxygen tension as mediators of TGF-? action in the skin, we examined the effects of hypoxia and glucocorticoids on the levels of active TGF-? and its signaling receptors and on the phosphorylation of its intracellular mediators, Smad 2 and Smad 3, in skin fibroblasts. Our results show that the active TGF-? levels, expression of types I and II receptors and phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 are markedly up-regulated by 2?hrs of hypoxia, whereas all these parameters are significantly downregulated by 24?hrs of hypoxia. Dexamethasone treatment of 2?hrs, on the other hand, increased active TGF-? levels and TGF-? receptor expression with little effect on the levels of phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3. However, dexamethasone treatment of 24?hrs downregulated the active TGF-? levels while maintaining the higher receptor expression, again with no significant effect on phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 levels. Interestingly, hypoxia had an additive effect on the steroid-induced downregulation of active TGF-? levels while counteracting the steroid-induced upregulation of TGF-? receptor expression. The upregulation at 2?hrs and the downregulation at 24?hrs of the components of TGF-? signaling pathway by hypoxia is consistent with the beneficial effect of initial hypoxia and the deleterious effect of sustained hypoxia, respectively, on wound healing. The synergestic and antagonistic effects of dexamethasone and hypoxia on the TGF-? signaling components emphasize the complex regulation of TGF-? signaling at multiple levels.

AB  - Patients who are hospitalized, elderly, or have spinal cord injury develop stage IV pressure ulcers in sacral, ischial, and trochanteric regions. Bone exposure of these pressure ulcers becomes a significant clinical problem. We propose that treatment of exposed bone with bone resection and a fibroblast-populated construct (FPC)(Dermagraft) accelerates healing. Four patients with stage IV sacral or ischial pressure ulcers where randomized to the control group and underwent bone resection with wet-to-dry dressing changes. Four other patients were randomized to the treatment group and underwent bone resection with application of FPC. Both groups were clinically monitored and treated with culture-specific antibiotics. The data showed that patients treated with FPC had their exposed bone covered after an average at 2.25 weeks, while the control groups required at least 4 weeks for bone coverage. Therefore, the preliminary data suggest that FPC is effective in reducing the time of bone exposure after sacrectomy/ischiectomy in pressure ulcer surgery. Acknowledgments:?

AB  - It has been speculated that a prolonged and elevated neutrophilic response has an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic wounds. This has raised the possibility that one or more of these proteases might be useful as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker for chronic wounds. The purpose of this study was to examine several primarily neutrophil-derived proteases present in pressure ulcer tissues and to determine whether protease activity could be correlated with neutrophil levels. Biopsies of pressure ulcers were taken from consented subjects (n?=?13) and again after 3 months standard care. Mean wound volume decreased 2.4?cm3 per month; however, volumes of six wounds were increased at the end of the study. Levels of extractable myeloperoxidase (MPO), elastase, collagenase-2 (MMP-8), and gelatinase (MMP-9) activities were determined. Mean levels of MPO (n?=?11) at study initiation and after 3 months were nearly identical (2945 and 2845 milliunits per mg extract, respectively). Interestingly, these levels were similar to that previously found in healing open dermal wounds at 4 days postwounding. MPO levels increased in the extracts obtained from three subjects and declined in five subjects. Elastase (corr. 0.265 p?=?0.233) and MMP-8 (corr. ?0.05 p?=?0.835) activities correlated poorly with MPO. This is likely a reflection of differences in the access of protease inhibitors (e.g., alpha1-antitrypsin, TIMP, and alpha2?macroglobulin) to these wounds. As expected, a greater correlation level was observed between the proteases (MMP-8 vs. elastase corr. 0.362 p?=?0.097; MMP-8 vs. MMP-9 corr. 0.55 p?=?0.009). The results from this study highlight the high degree of variability that can be observed in the pressure ulcer environment. This further suggests that a combination of biomarkers will be required for making accurate diagnostic assessments of chronic wounds. This work was supported by NIH GM 58530.

AB  - The Thermage system is a radiofrequency (RF) device designed to treat human skin. The Thermage ThermaCool TC? is a noninvasive, nonablative, nonlaser system that combines cryogen cooling and radiofrequency (RF) energy to volumetrically heat dermal and subdermal tissue. Thermage treatment causes collagen contraction resulting in immediate skin tightening. It has also been clinically shown to tighten skin over time. This long-term tightening effect is believed to result from the body?s wound healing response. We performed studies in a juvenile pig to characterize the wound healing response after ThermaCool treatment in order to elucidate the cellular and molecular events resulting from treatment. Histological markers of the wound healing process were examined over a 1-month period. Collagen gene expression was examined by quantitative PCR. Macrophages and mast cells are important inflammatory cell types that stimulate fibroblast recruitment, collagen synthesis and blood vessel growth. Three to 5 days following treatment, macrophages and mast cells were present in the dermis. By 28 days, both increased dermal blood vessel density and epidermal thickness was observed. Collagen I and collagen III genes were expressed at elevated levels by 21 days posttreatment. ThermaCool? treatment stimulates dermal remodeling by initiating a wound-healing response. This study demonstrates that thermage treatment results in the recruitment of important cellular mediators of wound healing and increased collagen synthesis in an animal model. These events are presumed to be responsible for dermal remodeling and skin tightening over time in human subjects. Because the Thermage device noninvasively delivers heat energy, it may be a unique tool for the examination of aseptic thermally induced wound models.

AB  - Introduction:? Hyaluronan (HA), a glycosaminoglycan found in many tissues, is most highly concentrated in the dermis and epidermis of the skin. HA is believed to have an important role in wound healing. HA is thought to be actively produced during wound healing and tissue repair to provide a framework for ingrowth of blood vessels and fibroblasts. The present study was performed to investigate the histology, levels, and molecular weight of hyaluronan in human open dermal wounds. Methods:? Dermal wounds were created using a 4?mm punch biopsy on the buttocks of 10 healthy adult subjects. Wounds were harvested using a 6?mm punch biopsy at postwound days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28. Tissue was then extracted for determining hyaluronan levels using a biotin hyaluronic acid link protein assay. The molecular weight distribution of hyaluronan was examined using agarose gel electrophoresis. Histology was performed using HA biotinylated binding protein with hyaluronidase controls. Results:? The levels of hyaluronan were found to have a bimodal distribution within the 28-day time course. Levels of HA increased from baseline values 12.4?±?6.3 to 47.3?±?7.5 (p?<?0.05) on postwound day 1. The lowest HA levels were found on postwound day 3 (26.4?±?8.5), with levels again increasing on postwound day 7 to the highest levels 73.4?±?13.6 (p?<?0.05). Postwound days 14 and 28 showed levels gradually declining toward baseline (49.4?±?5.7, 43.9?±?6.8). Molecular weight analysis showed smaller size HA on postwound day 1. Histological analysis demonstrated the presence of hyaluronan in the granulation tissue of healing wounds. Conclusion:? This is the first detailed examination of HA expression in human wounds. The bimodal display of HA levels in these wounds suggest that HA may be subject to fragmentation at times when the inflammatory index of these wounds is greatest.

AB  - Wound healing is a complicated biological process that involves interactions of multiple cell types, various growth factors, their mediators and the extracellular matrix proteins. In this study, we have studied the differential regulation of angiogenic genes during wound healing in transgenic diabetic mice and non-diabetic mice. One 8?mm full thickness cutaneous wound under aseptic conditions was created on either side of the midline. Wound tissues were studied at 4, 7, and 11 days postwounding and healing was assessed by histology. The pathway specific gene expression profile of wound tissue in transgenic diabetic mice was compared with the normal mice. Profiling of these genes showed differential regulation of many angiogenic promoters, inhibitors, growth factors and cytokines. Furthermore, in our study hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1a), osteopontin (OPN) and osteonectin are induced early at day 4, in both the diabetic and nondiabetic wound. The expression was downregulated by 11-day postwounding in the nondiabetic wound, whereas diabetic wounds showed constitutively high expression of these genes. The expression patterns of these genes were concomitant with the extent of healing as assessed by histology at different time point postwounding. These results suggest wound healing is a complex process that involves cascade of interaction of various factors. Although a single gene may not be solely responsible for any impairment in healing; however, an in-depth study of these genes and precise balance between the inducers and inhibitors of angiogenesis may provide an answer to the delayed healing in diabetic conditions.

AB  - Substance P(SP) modulates cytokine synthesis and adhesion molecule expression by inflammatory and endothelial cells in response to injury. A major proinflammatory effect includes nitric oxide(NO) production. Three nitric oxide synthase(NOS) isoforms include neuronal(nNOS), inducible(iNOS), and endothelial(eNOS). In this study, we determined which NOS enzymes mediate SP-induced NO upregulation in endothelial cells. Confluent human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) were treated with SP(10?8?M) for 48?h with and without the nonspecific NOS inhibitor N-nitro l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 4?uM) or specific inhibitors against nNOS (L-thiocitrulline;60?nM), iNOS (n-3-aminomethyl benzyl acetamidine;7?nM), eNOS (N-5-1-iminoethyl-L-ornithine; 0.5?uM). Inhibitors were added for 3?h prior to and continued throughout SP stimulation. Nitrate/nitrite levels were measured in cell extracts using Greiss reagents and standardized with protein concentration for each sample. Results are expressed as uM nitrate/mg protein. Statistical analysis was determined using ANOVA. Result are expressed as mean?±?sd; p?<?0.05 was considered statistically significant. SP effectively elevated nitrate levels (2.96?uM/mg protein;p?≤?0.05) compared to control treatment (2.1?uM/mg protein). All NOS inhibitors showed some inhibitory effect on substance P induced NO production. However, only L-NAME (1.9?uM/mg protein) and the specific eNOS inhibitor (2.32?uM/mg protein) demonstrated a significant decrease (p?<?0.05.) Our data suggest that SP up-regulation of NO in HMECs is primarily mediated by eNOS, but that other NOS enzymes may also contribute. Further studies are warranted to better understand the role of NOS in SP signaling.
