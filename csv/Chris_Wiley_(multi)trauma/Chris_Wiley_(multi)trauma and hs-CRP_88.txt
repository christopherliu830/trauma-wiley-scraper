AB  - An essential cell behavior for wound healing is the ability of reparative cells to migrate into a wound site. Impairment of this migratory behavior could delay or potentially halt the healing process, allowing for infection or other secondary insults to the wound. Type I diabetics experience significant morbidity from failure of lower extremity injuries to heal. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain this impaired healing response, but little is known about intrinsic migratory differences in the fibroblasts that populate the diabetic dermis prior to wounding. Nontransformed fibroblast cell lines from type I diabetics were obtained from the NIGMS-NIH cell repository at the Coriell Institute. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco?s modified Eagle?s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and either 25?mM (high) or 5.6?mM (low) glucose. Cell migration was measured over 72?hr by two methods; the monolayer scrape method, or by quantifying the movement of cells away from a circular source of cells, deposited within cloning rings, under high- or low-glucose conditions. The initial (0, 6, 24, and 48?hr) proliferative response of cells was measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation into confluent cell monolayers following partial scraping of the cell layer. Using the scrape method, diabetic cells failed to start moving across a monolayer scrape until?>?10?hrs, whereas normal fibroblasts had started migrating at 8?hrs and were noticeably closing the scrape ?wound? by 10 hours. Consistent with this finding, fibroblasts from diabetics showed impaired migration (70% vs. 145% increase in diameter) in high glucose over an initial 72?hrs in the second migration assay. This difference was less if the cells were cultured and tested in low glucose medium. In contrast, diabetic derived cells incorporated 3H-thymidine more rapidly at early times (55.9%[24?hr] and 72%[48?hr]) when cultured under high-glucose conditions. These results suggest that fibroblasts in the type I diabetic are characterized by a reduced capacity to migrate, but a normal or heightened proliferative capacity. This may indicate that injury to this connective tissue fails to produce the required influx of fibroblasts to deposit new matrix.

AB  - TGF?1 is a multipotent secreted cytokine that plays a pivotal role in wound healing. Previously, both positive and negative effects of TGF?1 on cutaneous wound healing have been reported. The mechanisms underlying these effects of TGF?1 remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we used a mouse model to examine the effects of cutaneous wound healing, wherein the latent form of TGF?1 is constitutively expressed in basal keratinocytes of the mouse epidermis, targeted by the keratin 5 promoter (K5.TGF?1). In wild-type mice with 6-mm full thickness excisional cutaneous wounds, TGF?1 protein levels were elevated immediately after wounding, and reached a peak level on day 3 postwounding, which was 3?5-fold higher than that in the nonwounded skin, and sharply declined afterward. This elevated expression pattern suggests that only transient TGF?1 overexpression is required for normal wound healing. In contrast, K5.TGF?1 mice with prolonged TGF?1 transgene expression at the level equivalent to the above peak level in wild-type mice exhibited a significant delay in healing of 6-mm full thickness excisional wounds when compared to wild-type mice. Histological analysis of wounds revealed delayed reepithelialization, increased inflammation and prolonged granular tissue accumulation in K5.TGF?1wt mice. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed excessive leukocyte infiltration in transgenic wounds when compared to wild-type wounds. Understandably, the accumulation of leukocytes was also accompanied by increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, angiogenic factors and fibrotic factors as determined by qRT-PCR analysis. Although the above factors override the growth inhibitory effect of TGF?1 on epidermal proliferation away from the wound edge, proliferation at the leading edge of the migrating keratinocytes was reduced in transgenic skin compared to the nontransgenic skin, evident by PCNA staining. Keratinocyte proliferation was also reduced in vitro when assessed by H3-thymidine incorporation. To assess the direct effect of TGF?1 on keratinocyte migration, we performed an in vitro migration assay and found that K5.TGF?1 keratinocytes had delayed migration when compared with wild-type cells. Our study suggests that prolonged TGF?1 expression in keratinocytes delays cutaneous wound healing by excessive inflammation, coupled to a direct inhibitory effect on keratinocyte proliferation and migration.

AB  - Background:? Essential parameters of wound healing are regulated by the wound environment., as reflected by the bathing wound fluid (WF). WF increases fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis, and also inhibits Nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in wound-derived fibroblasts. The aim of this study was to investigate whether WF influences NO metabolism in other wound cells, namely macrophages. Methods:? The mouse hybridoma macrophage cell line RAW 267.4 was employed. Cells were seeded at 2???105/well into 24 well plates or at 2???106 in Petri dishes. Cells were stimulated with 1??g/ml LPS and 10?U/ml IFN-gamma to induce inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). iNOS expression was investigated by Northern blotting after 6?h, enzyme secretion by western blotting after 20?h and NO production by nitrite synthesis in cell culture supernatants after 24?h. WF was harvested at different days postwounding from PVA sponges implanted into male Lewis rats. WF was added at 10%?v/v to the cell media. Cells were incubated in the presence of 60?mM L-valine, an arginase inhibitor, to rule out substrate (arginine) depletion by arginase as a mechanism. Results are expressed as mean?±?SD, n?=?5. Results:? Following inflammatory cytokine stimulation, RAW cells produced 57.36??mol nitrite/ml/24?h. Nitrite synthesis was significantly inhibited to 23.89?±?13.3 by day 7 and to 6.79?±?1.28 by day 10?WF, respectively. iNOS expression was almost completely blocked by addition of 10% WF from day 10 as assessed by Northern and western blotting. WF from the later days (day 10 and 14) had larger inhibitory effect than WF from early days (day 2, 5, and 7). Although omitting L-arginine from the media abolished iNOS expression, incubation of WF in the presence of 60?mM L-valine did not restore the inhibitory effect suggesting that arginase is not involved. Conclusion:? There is a factor in WF which strongly inhibits NO synthesis in RAW cells; the effect becomes more marked over time after wounding. The effect appears to be transcriptionally regulated since mRNA expression is impaired. Further characterization of this inhibitory factor is under way.

AB  - Introduction:? Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is an established treatment of chronic wounds. There is limited understanding of the molecular biological mechanisms of NPWT. The purpose of this study was to characterize changes in the biochemical composition of wound fluid collected from chronic pressure ulcer wounds in adults treated with NPWT. Methods:? Nine stage III or IV pressure ulcer patients scheduled for NPWT (V.A.C.? Therapy, KCI, San Antonio, TX) were recruited. Their ages ranged between 30 and 99. Concentrations of cytokines (IL-1?, TNF-α), metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-3), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 in wound fluids were measured at baseline and after 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days of continuous NPWT. Results:? At days 1, 3, and 7, TNF-α levels were significantly and comparably lower than baseline (p?<?0.05). MMP- 3 levels significantly decreased from baseline at days 1 and 3 (p?<?0.05) and significantly increased from baseline at day 7 (p?<?0.05) with continuous NPWT. IL-1? levels significantly increased at day 3 (p?<?0.05). There were no significant differences in TIMP-1 or MMP-2 levels at any of the time points when compared to baseline. Discussions and Conclusions:? A key finding of this study is that with NWPT, reductions in levels of the proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, from baseline levels were observed and this effect was sustained for at least 1 week. This, together with effects on IL-1 and MMP-3, may be an indication that the NPWT has a rapid and sustained effect on the inflammatory state of chronic wounds. Further studies are being conducted to expand sample size and to analyze other wound healing indicators.

AB  - Introduction:? Compelling evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO?) plays an important role in wound healing. Not only does it possess cytotoxic properties, but also regulatory functions on various cells involved in inflammation and proliferation. In wounds, inducible NO synthase (iNOS) catalyzes arginine to citrulline and NO?, whereas arginase converts arginine to ornithine and urea. Ornithine is an essential substrate for the synthesis of polyamines, which are important in cellular proliferation and repair. A model for regulation of wound healing proposes the importance of a strict reciprocal control of these enzymes in wounds. Human studies using impaired wound healing models, however, are lacking in this area. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate arginine metabolism in wound fluids of patients with pressure ulcers on Vacuum Assisted Closure (V.A.C.?) therapy. Methods:? Wound fluid extracts from 11 patients with stage III or IV pressure ulcer were analyzed for cytokines and metabolites of arginine. Sample age ranged from 31?92 years. Wound fluid was collected prior to V.A.C.? application and post-V.A.C.? within 24 hours, 3 days, and 7 days. Subjects served as their own control in this quasi-experimental repeated measures design. Spectrophotometric quantification of nitrates and nitrites using the Griess diazotization reaction method was performed. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1?) concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Levels of arginine, citrulline, ornithine, and proline were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Results:? There was no significant differences between pre- and post-V.A.C.? concentrations of NO?, citrulline, ornithine, and proline. However, there was a statistically significant decrease in arginine levels measured at baseline and day'3 of V.A.C.? treatment. Also, NO? measured at 24 hours of V.A.C.? placement decreased significantly at day 7 of therapy. Furthermore, post-V.A.C.? levels of TNF-α decreased significantly from baseline. A less cytotoxic environment is created, thus indicating a healing wound following 1 week of V.A.C.? therapy. Discussion:? Arginine and its metabolites are detectable in wound fluids from patients with pressure ulcers. To our knowledge, the metabolism of arginine has not been described in human subjects with pressure ulcers on V.A.C.? therapy. The determination of NO? in these wound environments provides baseline information on the mechanisms involved in aberrant wound healing.

AB  - The inflammatory phase of wound healing performs vital acts of host defense, removing invading microorganisms and or devitalized tissue. Characterized by an infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes, within hours of injury inflammation begins to effectively clear the wound in a strictly regulated manner in preparation for the following stages of repair and regeneration. Chronic wounds are varied in their etiology, resulting from many underlying pathologies. However, collectively they are often described as being in a persistent state of inflammation. Production of proinflammatory cytokines, proteinases and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this unregulated manner can cause significant damage. By stopping the action of proinflammatory cytokines, further recruitment of neutrophils may be diminished, helping to stop protease production at its source. Chronic wound dressings that are able to help interrupt the self- perpetuating process may help to create the optimal wound healing environment. In this study we investigated the impact of silver and then an ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC on the production of proinflammatory cytokines by lipopolysaccarhide (LPS) stimulated monocyte macrophages (THP-1 cells), an in vitro model of inflammation. The ability of the ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC matrix to quench free radicals was also investigated. Results show that the ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC is capable of reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. This dressing also has antioxidant activity, quenching ROS. These influences on the biochemistry of a chronic wound may have an antiinflammatory action, limiting the destruction of new tissue and promoting wound closure.

AB  - Chronic wounds fail to heal in the timely, ordered continuum demonstrated by acute wounds. The hostile biochemical environment of the chronic wound is one of the well-documented differences, which is thought to be responsible for the delay in healing. Overproduction of proteases, in particular matrix metalloproteinases and serine proteinases, are thought to destroy essential wound healing components including growth factors, shifting the balance in favor of tissue destruction rather than deposition. Chronic wound management must, therefore, aim to restore a more normal local wound environment. In wounds with an imbalance in bioburden, the origin of destructive proteolytic enzymes may be bacterial as well as host. Therefore, treatment to achieve a biochemical balance may need to address, not only, the level of microorganism, but also, the virulent factors they produce. An ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC addresses the wound micro'environment specifically targeting excess proteases. In this study we investigated the effect of ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC on serine and matrix metalloproteinases, as well as, its ability to preserve growth factors, as exem'plified by Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) from host and bacterial 'proteolytic degradation. The ORC/collagen matrix containing silver-ORC inactivated serine and matrix metalloproteinases from chronic wound fluids, as well as the proteolytic enzymes present in bacterial supernatants. It is also capable of preserving PDGF from proteolytic degradation. When compared to other commonly used wound dressings this is a unique characteristic of ORC/collagen, demonstrating their exclusive ability to absorb noxious components of wound fluid and restore a more normal wound healing environment.

AB  - Charcoal-based odor-absorbing dressings for management of odiferous chronic wounds have been marketed for many years. However, the presence of wound serum deactivates the charcoal and inhibits the adsorption of odor molecules. Charcoal dressings also generally need adjunct fixation to hold them in place. Avery Dennison Medical has developed a new series of hydrocolloid adhesives that provides an alternative technology for the adsorption of chronic wound odors. Dressings incorporating this technology are suitable for direct wound contact. In presence of serum, superior odor absorption with these new 'materials in comparison with charcoal dressings has been demonstrated in vitro. These new dressings have significant fluid absorption potential, are self-adhesive, and require no additional fixation. Some of the factors affecting performance of these new materials in vitro will be presented, as well as preliminary results from in vivo performance on chronic wounds. Acknowledgment:? This work was funded by Avery Dennison Medical, Tieblokkenlaan 1, B-2300 Turnhout, Belgium.

AB  - The present review aimed to summarize the effectiveness and features of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the treatment of infectious diseases and to discuss the limitation of the development of TCM. The personalized medicine with TCM exerts a curative effect on viral and bacterial infectious diseases with unique advantages on the improvement of clinical manifestation, pathogen inhibition, and organ recovery during severe and drug-resistant infection. The deficiency of personalized medicine with TCM lies in that the current research design of TCM primarily focuses on the study of the effective components and material basis of Chinese herbs at the cellular, molecular, and genetic level, while ignoring the guidance of the TCM syndrome differentiation theory, which is the core concept of individualized treatment. Personalized medicine with TCM has a broad prospective for infectious diseases due to the specific efficacy and advantages. While the curative effect of individualized treatment with TCM cannot be excluded from the TCM syndrome differentiation theory, the study of personalized medicine with TCM for infectious diseases urgently requires a unified standardization of the clinical syndrome differentiation and the evolution rule of infectious diseases by TCM theory.

AB  - Abstract Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in both developing and developed countries. Biomarkers for stroke and its outcome can greatly facilitate early detection and management of the disease. miRNAs have been explored for their potential as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and brain injury in ischaemic stroke. A substantial body of evidence suggests that miRNAs play key roles in numerous cellular changes following ischaemic stroke including mitochondrial dysfunction, energy failure, cytokine-mediated cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, activation of glial cells, increased intracellular calcium levels inflammatory responses and disruption of the blood?brain barrier (BBB). In addition, targeting specific miRNAs, therapeutic modulation of brain injury and apoptosis can also be achieved. Therefore, the current review has been compiled within an aim to give an overview of the developments exploiting miRNAs at different stages of stroke as prognostic, diagnostic, protective and therapeutic biomarkers.
