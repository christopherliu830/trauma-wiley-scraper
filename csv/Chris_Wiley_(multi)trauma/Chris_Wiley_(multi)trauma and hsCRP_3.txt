AB  - In March 2003, a series of cases of sudden respiratory disease syndrome (SARS) has been reported to be spreading in Toronto. With limited knowledge of the causative agent, an immediate strategy that would help contain and prevent the dissemination of the disease especially among our immunosuppressed hemodialysis patients was required. Objective:? To share the precautionary measures implemented in our unit in containing or preventing the spread of the virus among our hemodialysis patients. Methods:? Retrospective analysis of the impact of the implementation of strict measure of disease control and education of all staff. Other data were gathered through interviews of some Microbiologists in Toronto, St. Michael's Hospital Infection Control Department and Health, Canada. Result:? The precautionary measure implemented has been successful. None of our dialysis patients or health care workers were affected. Conclusion:? The measures implemented has not been proven 100% effective in protecting our dialysis patients and our staff, but we hope that the data will help prepare other health care professionals and other dialysis institutions in the event of another outbreak.

AB  - Background:? The purpose of this study was to evaluate the amount of neo-intimal tissue in-growth present at the arterial and venous sides of the anastomosis and the degree of endothelial cell lining of the graft lumen in sheep using commercial vascular grafts coated with the P15 cell-binding peptide. Methods:? ePTFE vascular grafts were coated with the cell-binding P15 peptide using a newly developed plasma surface treatment method. 4 P15-treated grafts and 2 control grafts were implanted as arterio-venous fistulas between the femoral artery and vein and between the carotid artery and jugular vein in 2 sheep. 1 animal was euthanized after 14 days and the other animal after 28 days. The grafts along with the connecting arteries and veins were explanted and evaluated for the length of tissue in-growth along the luminal surface of the ePTFE graft from the anastomosis at the arterial and venous sides. Intimal thickness was carefully measured. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) was used to confirm the endothelial cell lining. Results:? The study showed a significant difference (p?<?0.05) in intimal thickness between the coated and uncoated grafts in the venous side of the anastomosis. The average intimal thickness of coated samples (551??m) was 3 times thinner than that of uncoated ones (1657??m). The endothelial cell lining appeared to be thicker, and its coverage was more uniform for the peptide-coated grafts than the uncoated ones. Overall, there was more neo-intimal tissue in-growth at the venous side than the arterial side of the anastomosis. The intima at the venous side was also thicker and more bulky compared to the arterial side. Conclusion:? This study has demonstrated that P15-coated ePTFE grafts had less intimal tissue in-growth developed at the venous side of the anastomosis than the uncoated ePTFE grafts. The degree of endothelial cell lining for coated samples was also higher than uncoated ones, which is consistent with our in vitro studies using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. P15-coated ePTFE graft materials had significantly improved cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration in vitro over uncoated ePTFE.

AB  - Introduction:? Terminally ill patients requiring dialysis present complex ethical and medical dilemma to the nephrologists. With the rising health care costs and futility of care in such cases, the financial burden is a lingering concern. Methods:? We describe a 77-year-old male with lymphoma and prostate cancer admitted for abdominal pain and weight loss. He was found to have metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma on laparotomy. His malignancy was deemed inoperable and was offered palliative care. Subsequent hospital course was complicated by sepsis with multiple organ failure resulting in acute renal failure requiring dialysis support. Being aware of his poor prognosis, patient initially declined interventions including dialysis. He was later convinced by his family and agreed to aggressive therapeutic intervention. Anticipating a complicated course, hemodialysis was initiated through cuffed tunneled catheter (CTC). Subsequently, he had multiple episodes of sepsis resulting in removal of CTC, necessitating insertion of 9 temporary dialysis catheters and 3 CTC over a 9-month period; further complicated by thrombosis of both femoral veins. Eventually, patient's condition progressively deteriorated and dialysis was withdrawn with family's consent 9 months following surgery. Patient was put on comfort care and died 2 days later. He spent a total of 7½ months in ICU, 1 month in skilled care facility, and 2 weeks on regular hospital floor. Total VAMC expenditure was $373,964, which in a private setting would be approximately $1.0 million. Conclusion:? This case highlights the futility of aggressive management of renal failure in terminally ill elderly patients. Besides its inability to improve quality of life, it adds as a financial burden to the society.

AB  - Severe lithium poisoning requires intensive and prolonged hemodialysis (HD) treatment in addition to supportive therapy. Aggressive dialytic therapy can bring about hypophosphatemia, especially, in those patients who are normo- or hypophosphatemic to begin with. We report here the use of phosphorus (P)-enriched HD in a hypophosphatemic patient with lithium poisoning. A 58-year-old woman with a long history of bipolar disorder treated with chronic lithium therapy presented with progressively worsening confusion and incoherent speech. She was noted to be confused with a labile mood. The serum levels were lithium 3.6?mM, creatinine 1.7?mg/dL, Na 136?mM, K 4.2?mM, CO2 21?mM, BUN 23?mg/dL, and P 2.1?mg/dL. After a conventional, 4-h HD session, she became more hypophosphatemic with a P level of 1.8?mg/dL. A P-enriched dialysate, prepared by adding a Fleet? oral saline laxative preparation (containing NaH2PO4.H2O and Na2HPO4.7H2O) to the ?base concentrate? of a dual concentrate, bicarbonate-based dialysate generating system to obtain a final dialysate containing 3?mg (0.97?mM) of P/dL was used. She underwent 3 subsequent HD sessions using this P-enriched dialysate, followed by normalization of the serum levels of both lithium and P. Our data suggest that hypophosphatemic patients suffering from severe lithium poisoning requiring intensive HD therapy and becoming more hypophosphatemic as a result of the dialysis treatment can be further dialyzed with a P-enriched dialysate both to treat the lithium poisoning and to rectify the hypophosphatemia. In general, the use of such dialysates can play an important role in the prevention and treatment of dialysis-induced hypophosphatemia.

AB  - Valproic acid toxicity is not infrequent and is difficult to treat, as there is no specific antidote. In the past, this drug was considered unremovable by extracorporeal methods because of the highly protein bound state (90?95%). However, recent reports suggest that the toxicokinetics of valproate vary considerably from the pharmacokinetics at therapeutic levels, and at higher concentrations protein-binding sites become saturated. The drug's relatively low molecular weight (144?Da), small volume of distribution (0.13?0.23?L/kg), and saturable protein binding render it potentially amenable to extracorporeal removal, but published experience is scant and there are only a few reported instances in which patients were successfully treated with extracorporeal methods. Here we report the case of a patient with serious valproate toxicity treated with simultaneous ?in series? hemodialysis and hemoperfusion followed by continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration. A 35-year-old homeless male presented to the emergency department after ingesting 120 pills of valproic acid. Initial valproic acid level was 59?µg/mL. Urine drug screen was negative and serum chemistries including LFTs were normal. He was treated with activated charcoal and admitted to the intensive care unit. 4 h later, he developed respiratory failure and became hemodynamically unstable. He was intubated and successfully resuscitated. Subsequently, the valproic acid level was found to be 553?µg/mL and a decision was made to employ extracorporeal methods for drug removal. ?In series? hemodialysis and hemoperfusion were done for 4?h and simultaneous blood samples for measurement of valproic acid levels were obtained as blood entered the hemoperfusion column (arterial) and as it exited the hemodialysis membrane (venous). Extraction ratio, whole blood, and plasma clearances were calculated and they compared substantially with the published data. The above measures decreased valproate levels from 572.6 (pre-dialysis level) to 203.2?µg/mL. This was followed by continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration for 18?h, which sustained the drug removal and prevented significant post-dialytic rebound. This is the first reported instance in which these three methods were administered together successfully in the management of valproic acid toxicity.

AB  - Plasma fibrinogen is a well-known predictor of cardiovascular disturbances, and C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with elevated causes of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. That is the reason to look for the causes of increased CRP levels in CRF and haemodialysis (HD). The study tries to find whether interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a consistent factor for CRP elevation in CRF and/or in HD patients, when a dialysis-induced IL-6 synthesis may occur, as IL-6 has been claimed as a responsible factor for production of some acute phase proteins like CRP. CRP [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique, limit 0.1?µg/L], IL-6 (ELISA, Medgenix, Brussels, Belgium), and fibrinogen (photometric technique) were tested in 45 stable predialytic CRF patients (mean age 48?±?7 years) and in 50 stable HD patients (mean age 62?±?15). In CRF patients, a positive correlation was found between plasma fibrinogen (mean 356?±?167?mg/dL) and CRP (r?=?0.51, p?<?0.01) and between fibrinogen and proteinuria (r?=?0.32, p?<?0.01), but no correlation was found between CRP and IL-6. In HD patients, a high positive correlation was registered between CRP (mean 6.93?±?5.88?mg/L) and IL-6 (mean 9.4?±?10.6?pg/mL) (r?=?0.84, p?<?0.001) and between CRP and fibrinogen (mean 325?±?110?mg/dL) (r?=?0.59, p?<?0.001). The study suggests that, in HD patients, one of the factors stimulating hepatic production of CRP is probably IL-6, which is synthesized by the dialysis-related, activated macrophages. In predialytic patients, the bacterial products in dialysate and their effect on macrophages are absent and there is no correlation between CRP and IL-6.

AB  - The purpose of the poster was to demonstrate how Leininger's theory of transcultural nursing is utilized daily within the multicultural pediatric population at the hospital for sick children. Methods:? Within this diverse and challenging population, the hemodialysis nurse is constantly challenged to ensure that the nursing care provided to the patient is reflective and meeting the needs of our pediatric population and their families. Leininger's theory of transcultural nursing has provided an avenue to ensure that the many cultures of our clients are maintained and respected. A case study will be used to show the integration of Leininger's theory. Resources for supporting the cultural values of the hemodialysis patient will also be identified. Conclusion:? The use of a transcultural nursing model enhances the quality and effectiveness of the patient care provider for the pediatric hemodialysis patient at the hospital for sick children. Utilization of a transcultural nursing model ensures that the patients and their families are respected and supported for their diverse backgrounds by the hemodialysis nurse. The hemodialysis nurses are providing quality nursing care which reflects the needs and concerns of a multicultural population.

AB  - The LifeSite System is a new subcutaneous vascular access option for hemodialysis patients. As the procedure for accessing the LifeSite differs from hemodialysis catheters, we prospectively studied the differences in time required to initiate and discontinue treatments for LifeSite patients compared to patients with hemodialysis catheters. We also collected data on the cost of supplies and the number of alarms during dialysis for both groups. 5 LifeSite and 5 catheter patients were chosen at random for participation in the study. The time required for the ON and OFF procedures was recorded for 3 consecutive dialysis sessions for each patient for a total of 15 observations/group. The average staff time required per session for supply preparation, ON/OFF procedure, dressing changes, and responding to alarms was 15.9?min for the LifeSite and 16.9?min for catheters. Catheter patients experienced 4.5 access-related alarms per session compared to 2.5 access-related alarms per session for LifeSite patients. This increase in the number alarms for catheter patients resulted in an increase in average staff time required to resolve the cause of these alarms vs. LifeSite patients (3.4 vs. 0.87?min/session). There was a minimal difference in the cost of access-related supplies between LifeSite and catheter patients at our center ($3.71 vs. $3.88 per session, respectively) based on dialysis center acquisition costs. This study demonstrates that attaining a critical mass of LifeSite patients in a dialysis unit enables the dialysis staff to develop the skill to initiate and discontinue treatments for patients with the LifeSite in a timeframe similar to that required to do the same for catheter patients. The overall cost of supplies to care for LifeSite patients in a dialysis unit is also similar to those used for catheter patients.

AB  - Acute renal failure requiring dialysis therapy after cardiac surgery occurs in 1?5% of patients; however, the optimal timing for the initiation of dialysis therapy still remains undetermined. To assess the validity of early start of dialysis therapy, we studied the comparative survival between 14 patients who started to receive dialysis therapy with the timing of decrease of urine volume less than 30?mL/h and other 14 patients who waited to begin dialysis therapy until the level of urine volume of less than 20?mL/h during 14 days. Overall mortality of those patients was 50%. Twelve of 14 patients who received the early intervention survived. In contrast, only 2 of 14 patients in the other group survived. There was a significant difference of p?<?0.01 between the two groups. Between the two groups, there were no significant differences in age, sex ratio, the score of APACHE (Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation) II, and the levels of serum creatinine at the start of dialysis therapy (2.9?+?0.2 vs. 3.1?+?0.2?mg/dL) as well as in the levels of serum creatinine at admission. The start timing for the treatment of acute renal failure following cardiac surgery would be determined by the decrease of urine volume but not by the levels of serum creatinine. The early start of dialysis therapy might be preferable for the improvement of survival of the patients suffering from acute renal failure following cardiac surgery.

AB  - Background/Aims:? Procalcitonin (PCT) has been described as a new marker of severe infection and sepsis. In this study, we investigated the serum levels of PCT during the hemodialysis (HD) in chronically hemodialyzed patients and whether the PCT levels were correlated with other cytokines. Methods:? We measured pre- and post-HD PCT, interleukin (IL-1), IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) concentrations in 24 stable patients undergoing chronic HD [11 males and 13 females; age 41.2?±?18.0 years, 12?h/week, with a Kt/V of 1.41?±?0.35, polysynthane (PSN) membrane being used in all patients, without reuse]. Pre- and post-HD PCT concentrations were compared with cytokines such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and clinical parameters including age, blood pressure, leukocyte, hemoglobin levels, C-reactive protein (CRP), epoetin (EPO) doses, BUN, creatinine, parathormone (PTH), ferritin, and transferrin levels. Results:? Pre- and post-HD serum PCT levels were similar (0.77?±?0.40 and 0.83?±?0.61 ng/mL), and higher than upper normal level of 0.5?ng/mL. The levels of IL-2 and IL-10 decreased and the levels of IL-1 and TNF-α increased. Post-HD PCT correlated with PTH, IL-1, IL-2, and IL-10. Conclusion:? About 60% of patients had elevated PCT levels, HD with low-flux PSN membrane did not change serum PCT and IL-6. While IL-1 and TNF-α increased, IL-2 and IL-10 decreased by PSN membrane during HD. So that PCT levels can be measured just after HD as do prior to start of HD. Is there any relationship between PCT and PTH? PCT may be important in uremic bone disease.

AB  - Frequent or occasional symptomatic intradialytic hypotension during hemodialysis may influence patients' well being, but its effects on survival, independent of comorbidities, have not previously been investigated. Objective:? To assess the effect of frequent (f-IDH) or occasional (o-IDH) dialysis-associated hypotension on survival. Methods:? During the run in period in 1998, 77 patients with f-IDH (≥10 hypotensive events/10 months, responding only to medical intervention) and 101 patients with o-IDH (1 or 2 events/10 months) were identified among all 958 prevalent chronic hemodialysis patients of a network. Eighty-five patients who had no hypotensive episodes (no-IDH) served as controls. Patients were followed for a median of 27 months (range 0.3?37), and survival of patients was compared by log-rank test. Independent association of f-IDH and o-IDH on survival, compared to no-IDH, was assessed by proportional hazards model that included patient's demographics, laboratory data, comorbidity as well as medications. Results:? Forty-five patients (58%) with f-IDH, 47 (47%) with o-IDH, and 33 (39%) with no-IDH died during the follow up that represents mortality rates of 37 (p?=?0.013 vs. no-IDH), 26 (p =?0.375 vs. no-IDH), and 21 deaths/100?patient years in the three groups, respectively. In multivariate proportional hazards regression, where age, sex, time on dialysis, CHD, diabetes, Kt/V, albumin level, use of beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and long-acting nitrates have been adjusted for, neither f-IDH nor o-IDH was associated with survival. Conclusion:? Mortality in patients with f-IDH is significantly higher than in those without such events. Our data, however, did not provide evidence that f-IDH, independent of age and comorbidities, contributes to mortality in these patients.

AB  - Central venous catheters (CVC) remain a frequently used form of vascular access in children receiving chronic hemodialysis (HD). Whereas standard dual-lumen catheters (DL) are used in many centers, the Tesio catheter has proven to be superior to the DL catheter in terms of catheter survival and infection rates in at least one pediatric study (Sheth RD et al. Am J Kidney Dis. 2001). Recently, the Ash Split catheter became available which, while similar to the Tesio internally, being comprised of 2 separate catheters, may be preferable because of the requirement for only one skin puncture for placement vs. two for the Tesio. However, no pediatric data pertaining to the Ash Split catheter have been published to date. Therefore, we reviewed and compared our experience with a small number of Ash Split (# 16) and Tesio (# 8) catheters used for semipermanent vascular access in our chronic HD population with reference to survival, infectious complications, patency, and dialysis adequacy. The results of this experience are as follows: Tesio Ash Split Survival >3 months 6/8 12/15 Sepsis (epi/catheter mo) 1/30 1/25 Exit-site infection (epi/catheter mo) 1/8.6 1/19 sp Kt/V urea 1.67 1.88 % sp Kt/V urea >1.2 100 90 Reasons for the removal of Tesio catheters were transplant (4), sepsis (1), deterioration of tubing (1), and accidental (1). Ash Split catheter removal resulted from sepsis (2), fistula placement (4), thrombosis (1), and accidental (2). This preliminary experience reveals similar outcome data for the Tesio and Ash Split catheters when used in pediatric HD patients. Definitive statements regarding the superiority of either catheter awaits additional data collection and analysis.

AB  - Lynchburg Nephrology Dialysis Inc. started its nightly home hemodialysis (NHHD) program in September 1997. Purpose of study:? To evaluate episodes of exit site infections, catheter sepsis, safety, and longevity of accesses for patients doing NHHD. Methods:? If IJ catheter was chosen, patient was started on Coumadin 2?mg/day when catheter was placed. If catheter malfunctioned, it was locked with a thrombolytic agent and Coumadin was adjusted to meet a goal INR of 1.5?2.25. If the problem persisted, the catheter was exchanged. For catheters, the B-D InterLink device was used to prevent air emboli and infection, and a locking device was used to prevent disconnects. If AV fistula was used, 4 buttonholes were established using 16 gauge needles. If AV graft was used, patients were taught the ladder cannulation technique using 16 gauge needles. Results:? As of September 1, 2003, 45 patients have completed training and have performed 27,063 treatments at home. Total catheter time at home was 930 months. Total AV fistula and AV graft time at home was 190 and 20 months, respectively. Upon completion of training, 34 patients were using tunneled IJ catheters, 10 using AV fistulas, and 1 using an AV graft. The IJ catheter exit site and sepsis infection rate was 0.35 and 0.49 episodes/1000 patient days, respectively. Average catheter life was 8.5 months with the longest 66.7 months and the shortest 0.2 months. The AV fistula and graft exit site and sepsis infection rates were 0.16 and 0 episodes/1000 patient days, respectively. Catheter complications included 1 episode of disconnect due to patient's failure to use locking device, 1 episode of central stenosis, and 1 episode of intracranial hemorrhage, due to prolonged INR, with resolution of symptoms. Conclusion:? Data support that tunneled IJ catheters, AV fistulas, and AV grafts were effective and safe permanent accesses for patients on NHHD.

AB  - Poorly functioning dialysis access, whether graft or AV fistula, is a contributor to decreased efficiency of dialysis. Thrombosis results in the need for surgery and increases patient suffering. Objectives:? To determine whether an advanced glycation end product (AGE), pentosidine, might serve as a marker of disease activity and thrombosis of dialysis access. These results were obtained during the blinded phase of a study to evaluate the efficacy of the antioxidant vitamin E in preventing vascular access thrombotic events. Methods:? Twenty-six patients had blood drawn and access flow evaluated initially and at intervals for up to 1.5 years. In the study design, participants received either 800?IU vitamin E daily by mouth or identical placebo capsules. Blood plasma was examined to determine pentosidine content at baseline and every 3?m. Patients with an access flow of <800?mL/min were referred to a surgeon for evaluation. Access flow was evaluated by using the transonic flow meter and the saline release method. When sequential double dialyzers were used, saline injection method was applied post dialyzers, but before the venous drip chamber. Results:? Mean initial level of pentosidine before the administration of vitamin E was 20.22?pmol/mg (range 5.04?59.62?pmol/mg). During the study period, 5 patients had procedures related to thrombosis performed on their accesses. Blood drawn before the thrombotic event showed an increase above baseline of 6.87?±?15.47 (range ?5.9 to +33.7?pmol/mg). Patients without events showed a mean decrease of 9.7?± 12.24?pmol/mg pentosidine (p?<?0.02). Conclusion:? An increase in levels of pentosidine was associated with clotting of hemodialysis access. This change may reflect the effects of oxidative stress and/or thrombus formation. As these data are gathered from an ongoing double-blinded study, the effect of vitamin E on thrombus formation and pentosidine levels has not yet been ascertained.

AB  - It has been shown that daily hemodialysis as well as convective transfer by hemofilitration improve the quality of extra renal treatment. Two following phases of treatment of three weeks each were tested in 2 patients: daily hemodialysis 2.5?h 6 times/week (HD*6) and daily hemofiltration 2.75?h 6 times/week (HF*6) performed according to the following modalities. Phase I, blood flow rates (QB): 300?mL/min, hemofilter 1.4 m2AN 69 dialysate flow 500?mL/min. Phase II, QB: 150?mL/min, hemofilter 1m2AN 69, exchange volume of 10?L/session; 5?L predilution and 5?L postdilution (conditions were limited by the device). We measured, during the third week of treatment of each phase, the weekly mass transfers and the predialysis plasma levels of urea (U), creatinine (C), phosphate (P), and B2 microglobulin (B2M). In the 2 phases, HD*6 and HF*6, respectively, the weekly urea Kt was: 120 vs. 60?L; std Kt/V: 3.30 vs. 2.0; npcr: 1.26 vs. 1.42?g?kg?1?day?1. Mass transfer/week Predialytic levels/L HD*6 HF*6 HD*6 HF*6 U (mmol) ?2366 ?2204 ?23.2 ?38.5 C (µmol) 67240 51096 769.5 934.8 P (mmol) ??127 ??111.5 ??1.91 ??2.34 B2M (mg) ??311 ??763.5 ?34.2 ?30.16 In HF*6, predialysis solute concentration increased and weekly small molecule mass transfer was insufficient. B2M mass transfer was significantly increased and predialytic plasma concentration decreased, showing a higher clearance of middle molecules with convective transfer. The clinical tolerance was excellent during the two phases of treatment. This study allows to determine the optimal conditions for adequate daily HF: higher QB and exchange volume. Further studies with QB of at least 300?mL/min and with exchange volume of 15?L/session seem to be necessary.

AB  - Hyperphosphatemia and poor uremia control are established cardiovascular risk factors in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) associated with impaired endothelial dependent and independent vasodilation (EDV and EIV). Nocturnal hemodialysis [6???8?h/week] augments dialysis dose and offers normal phosphate (Pi) balance. We hypothesized that NHD would restore EDV (endothelial function) and EIV (vascular smooth muscle cell function) by simultaneously improving uremia and Pi control. 2 groups of ESRD patients (mean age 41?±?2 years) stratified according to their baseline plasma Pi levels (normal Pi <1.8?mM, high Pi >1.8?mM) were studied. Dialysis dose (Kt/V per session), plasma Pi, blood pressure (BP) and brachial artery responses to reactive hyperemia (EDV), and sublingual nitroglycerin (EIV) were examined before, 1 and 2 months after conversion from conventional hemodialysis (CHD) [3???4?h/week] to NHD. After 2 months, NHD increased dialysis dose (from 1.24?±?0.06 to 2.04?±?0.08; p?=?0.02) and lowered BP (from 140?±?5/82?±?3 to 119?±?1/71?±?3, p?=?0.01) in all patients. In patients with adequate Pi control during CHD, EDV was normalized after 1 month of NHD. In contrast, in the high Pi group, 1 month of NHD was sufficient to reduce plasma phosphate levels, but 2 months of NHD was required for EDV to improve. Variables Normal Pi (n=10) CHD NHD (1month) NHD (2months) High Pi (n=8) CHD NHD (1month) NHD (2 months) Pi (mM) ?1.44?±?0.09 1.08?±?0.07* 1.14?±?0.11* 2.52?±?0.3 1.40?±?0.17* 1.26?±?0.05* EDV (%) ?3.4?±?2.7 7.5?±?1.9* 7.6?±?1.3* ?1.7?±?1.3 0.37?±?1.6? ?8.8?±?1.2* EIV (%) ?8.2?±?4.8 10.3?±?2.0 15.1?±?2.0* 5.1?±?1.1 ?6.6?±?0.8? 16.9?±?1.7* * p?<?0.05 from values during CHD. ? p?<?0.05 between the normal and high Pi groups. Correction of uremia without normalization of plasma Pi is insufficient to improve EDV. The time course over which this improvement in vascular responsiveness occurs is delayed in hyperphosphatemic patients, suggesting that improvement in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell function requires restoration of normal intracellular Pi balance.

AB  - Background:? Hemodialysis is often complicated by cardiovascular instability (CVI). We studied factors contributing to this problem during 720 hemodialyses (HDs) in 20 patients; 480 dialyses were 6/week and 240 were 3/week. Methods:? Dependent variables were increase in pulse rate (PR) and maximal (MAX) and overall (OV) fall of systolic blood pressure (BP). Independent variables were dialyses/week (DIAL), ultrafiltration (Uf), % of body weight (BW), pre-post BUN (?BUN), time on dialysis (T), speed of dialysis (K/V in mL?min?1?kg?1 BW), target-postdialysis BW (Ta-Po BW), Kt/V, ?PO4, ?bicarbonate, ?potassium, ?BUN, an ?unphysiology index? summing up changes in electrolytes, and BUN and BW during dialysis (UPI). The relations were analyzed by backward multiple regression analysis. Results:? PR increased 0.5?±?11/min; MAX BP fall was 23?±?17?mmHg; OV BP fall was 12?±?19?mmHg. In multiple stepwise backward regression analysis, independents in order of importance: PR?=?38???DIAL???4?+?T???0.1?+?Uf???1.8?+?PO4 ??1.8???UPI??0.2???K/V???2, r?=?0.30, p?<?0.0001; MAX BP?=?UPI???0.4????BUN???0.3?+??PO4???2.6?+?11, r?=?0.34, p?<?0.0001; OV BP?=?UPI???0.4????BUN???0.3?+?PO4???2.7 +?1, r?=?0.33, p?<?0.0001. Conclusion:? To prevent BP fall and tachycardia during hemodialysis, the most important factor to decrease is unphysiology, i.e., the oscillations in electrolytes, fluid spaces, and osmolality that occur during dialysis. The best way to do this is to dialyze patients daily. An unexpected finding worthy of further investigation was the large detrimental influence of ?PO4 on CVI.

AB  - Objective:? The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of serological and molecular markers of hepatitis (A?E) and human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLV) in hemodialysis (HD) patients of central Greece. Methods:? 370 patients (246 males, 60?±?14?years) attending the renal units (RUs) of central Greece (n?=?5) were tested for anti-HAV IgG, hepatitis B virus markers, anti-HCV, anti-HEV, and anti-HTLV-I/II with ELISA. In 131 casual samples, regardless of anti-HCV status, a sensitive, qualitative HCV-RNA assay (Versant?, Bayer) based on transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) was applied. Results:? Previous HBV infection (anti-HBc) was found in 48% and current HBV infection in 5.5% (HbsAg) of the patients. Anti-HAV was detected in 94% while anti-HDV and anti-HTLV were negative. Anti-HCV prevalence was 23% varying from 11 to 36% in the different RUs. Frequency of anti-HEV (4.1%) was also highly varying (1.4?9.8%). There was no association between the infection markers and age, sex, or history of transfusion. Anti-HCV correlated with duration of HD. HCV-RNA was detected in 44/131 samples. In 15 cases results of anti-HCV and TMA were contradicting. Two anti-HCV negative samples were HCV-RNA positive (2.3%). Conclusion:? In RUs of central Greece, a high prevalence of HCV infection was found, associated with the duration of HD. The high prevalence of anti-HEV found in 1 RU must be investigated further. In some of anti-HCV-negative patients viremia was detected. This result indicates that a considerable number of HCV infections are serologically occult. HCV-RNA testing, regardless of the anti-HCV status, has to be considered seriously in HD patients.
