AB  - Objective:? The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of serological and molecular markers of hepatitis (A?E) and human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLV) in hemodialysis (HD) patients of central Greece. Methods:? 370 patients (246 males, 60?±?14?years) attending the renal units (RUs) of central Greece (n?=?5) were tested for anti-HAV IgG, hepatitis B virus markers, anti-HCV, anti-HEV, and anti-HTLV-I/II with ELISA. In 131 casual samples, regardless of anti-HCV status, a sensitive, qualitative HCV-RNA assay (Versant?, Bayer) based on transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) was applied. Results:? Previous HBV infection (anti-HBc) was found in 48% and current HBV infection in 5.5% (HbsAg) of the patients. Anti-HAV was detected in 94% while anti-HDV and anti-HTLV were negative. Anti-HCV prevalence was 23% varying from 11 to 36% in the different RUs. Frequency of anti-HEV (4.1%) was also highly varying (1.4?9.8%). There was no association between the infection markers and age, sex, or history of transfusion. Anti-HCV correlated with duration of HD. HCV-RNA was detected in 44/131 samples. In 15 cases results of anti-HCV and TMA were contradicting. Two anti-HCV negative samples were HCV-RNA positive (2.3%). Conclusion:? In RUs of central Greece, a high prevalence of HCV infection was found, associated with the duration of HD. The high prevalence of anti-HEV found in 1 RU must be investigated further. In some of anti-HCV-negative patients viremia was detected. This result indicates that a considerable number of HCV infections are serologically occult. HCV-RNA testing, regardless of the anti-HCV status, has to be considered seriously in HD patients.

AB  - Purpose:? Quality of life (QoL) is a well-recognized important measure of therapy outcome, as it reflects what patients perceive as their health condition. The aim of this study was to estimate the QoL in patients on HD and to find the factors that mainly affect it. Patients and Methods:? We studied 70 patients on HD (38 male, age 57.86?±?14.63 years) with the use of kidney disease quality of life short form. Physical health (PH), mental health (MH), kidney disease issues (KDIs), and patient satisfaction (PS) were assessed, as well as Khan comorbidity index, adequacy of dialysis, nutrition, and epidemiologic and laboratory data. Results:? PH was significantly correlated with comorbidity (p?<?0001), age (p?<?0001), duration of HD (p?<?0001), serum albumin (Salb) (p?<?0005), the existence of a living relative donor (p?<?0001), Hb (p?<?0.01), and CRP (p?<?0.01). MH was significantly correlated to comorbidity (p?<?0001), age (p?<?0001), duration of HD (p?<?0001), Salb (p?=?0002), the existence of a living relative donor (p?<?0001) and Hb (p?<?0.01). KDI score was significantly correlated with comorbidity (p?<?0001), age (p?<?0001), duration of HD (p?<?0001), and Hb (p?<?0.05). The acceptance of the method was significantly lower in patients with AVF dysfunction (p?<?0005). As much as 44.3% of patients presented inadequate compliance to dietary and fluid restrictions. Conclusion:? Frequent QoL assessment in patients on HD is a useful tool for professionals involved in patients' care. Older age, long time on HD, malnutrition, elevated CRP, and comorbid conditions are correlated to lower QoL scores.

AB  - Low serum albumin, high serum phosphorus, and fluid overload are common issues in dialysis patients. This can be attributed to many causes such as inadequate understanding and lack of accountability in the patients' care. These abnormal levels contribute to increased medical complications and increased mortality. Objective:? (i) Improve patient education of albumin, phosphorus, and fluid maintenance. (ii) Improve patients' albumin, phosphorus, and fluid levels by 25 percent. Methods:? A baseline level was collected on all patients by averaging last 3 laboratory findings. All patients were educated recognizing several different learning styles. Educational posters were displayed, one-on-one education was provided, as well as educational games on the role of albumin, phosphorus, and fluid. Patients were also educated on the role of diet in these levels. Positive reinforcement, peer pressure, and intensive team approach were used through the 8-week incentive contest. Feedback on progress was provided in written and verbal format. Prizes were awarded for best shift levels and shift with most improvements. Results:? Levels measured at the end of the educational period and contest showed a 71% improvement in albumin levels, 52% improvement in phosphorus levels, and a 42% improvement in fluid levels. Conclusion:? Significant improvements found in all areas are attributed to three factors: education, consistent, individual, intensive attention, and incentives. Peer pressure was found not to be as effective but that individual tracking for incentives may be more effective if done ongoing. Our follow up several months later found a slight decrease in improvements, and we recognize a need for an ongoing intervention. Yet, we found an overall improvement of level of understanding and commitment to their overall health.

AB  - Aim:? The comparative study of hemodialysis (HD) adequacy of Kt/V measurement between classic method (Daugirdas formula) and urea sensor monitor (online). Patients and methods:? 30 patients with end-stage renal failure undergoing dialysis were studied. A comparative evaluation of HD adequacy during the same session was done with two different methods: (1) blood samples were drawn in the beginning and in the end of HD session for the measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and after measurement of HD adequacy by 3rd generation Daugirdas formula and (2) urea sensor monitor use for continuous HD adequacy measurement during HD session. Results:? There was statistically significant correlation of Kt/V Daugirdas with Kt/V online (r?=?0.8, p?<?0.001). Also there was statistically significant correlation between solute removal index (SRI), Kt/V Daugirdas (r?=?0.81, p?<?0.001) and Kt/V online (r?=?0.92, p?<?0.001). From nutrition indices that were measured, the protein catabolic rate (PCR) had marginal negative correlation with the two compared adequacy indices, Kt/V Daugirdas (r?=??0.24, p?<?0.03), and Kt/V online (r?=??0.17, p?<?0.03) although the nPCR (normalized PCR) had marginal positive correlation (r?=?0.35, p?<?0.05) (r?=?0.42, p?<?0.05). Conclusions:? The use of online urea sensor monitors contributes to the easy measurement of adequacy and nutrition indices and hence complicated mathematical formulas are not necessary. The results of these measurements are reliable and comparable with classic methods of HD adequacy evaluation.

AB  - Interest in quotidian (daily) hemodialysis (DHD) seems to be growing. DHD improves quality of life, blood pressure control, and nutrition, and decreases the need of medications, including erythropoiesis stimulating factors (ESF). We evaluate the short daily dialysis (SDHD) efficacy in 14 patients in conventional hemodialysis (HD) (3 weekly sessions/4?h), mean age 52.1 years, range 25?75, 10 males and 4 females, and found that they needed to increase dialysis efficiency by different medical indications: in 11 cases traditional indications ? 5 cases with hypertensive myocardiopathy and severe LVH (2 of them with low left ventricle ejection fraction), 2 cases with symptomatic, ischemic cardiopathy 2 patient with big body-surface area and elevated phosphorus levels, and 2 patients by inadequate dialysis (infradialysis conditioning malnutrition status) secondary to HD with permanent catheter. In one female (25 yr old), SDHD was prescribed to improve cardiac toxicity secondary to chemotherapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia. The index resistance of ESF decreased since the first month, and the Aranesp doses decreased by more than 40%. 1 male (49 years) with nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy showed skin lesions with osteoblastic transformation. The skin lesions were improving since the first week, obtaining a decrease of the index resistance ESF higher than 60% in the first month. 1 male with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic myocardiopathy showed improvement of symptoms and quality of life since the first weeks, as well as echocardiograpic signs and improvement in Hb levels and decreasing dose of ESF. The schedule in all of them was 5?6 days/week sessions between 2.15?h and 3?h, depending on body-surface area. To obtain a weekly Kt/V nearest to 4, HD sessions were realized in the hospital (7?pts) or in satellite unit (7?pts). The time remaining in this schedule was between 1 and 42 months. All the patients showed clinical improvement, subjective and objective, since the first week of start of SDHD. 3 patients could be included in Tx waiting list again. Anemia improved, decreasing index resistance of ESF. In relation with this, the time necessary to improve the response to ESF was different, showing a decrease in the first month higher than 40% in two cases dialyzing with a membrane high-flux with pore size 100?A, appearing high Hb levels also in a polycystic patient always without ESF. We observed by analyzing the results in 12 stable patients; the patients with high-flux dialyzers showed better response to ESF. Perhaps it could offer a better clearance of large molecules (inhibitor erythropoiesis factor and high molecular weight toxins) that participate to respond to ESF. Conclusion:? Our experience shows new indications for SDHD with very good results. Anemia was improved in relation with SDHD, when synthetic high-flux membranes and high pore size were used.

AB  - The Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH) has dialyzed >320 patients with ESRD since 1993. Objective:? To identify differences, and their causes, in the practice of dialysis between Nigerian state-owned dialysis units and U.S.A. Methods:? We analyzed the characteristics of chronic dialysis at JUTH. Results:? At JUTH, chronic dialysis is started at development of frank uremia (K/DOQI standard: creatinine clearance >10?mL/min, no overt uremia). Frequency of hemodialysis was 3 times weekly in 2 patients, twice weekly in 1 and once weekly or longer in 7 patients. Breakdowns in the dialysis machinery, which is outdated, forced additional decreases in the frequency of dialysis. Duration of a dialysis session was 4?h by prescription, but much longer in several sessions because of dialysis machine breakdown during the session (US standard: 4?h). 2 patients were dialyzed through arterio-venous fistulas and 8 patients were dialyzed though temporary femoral vein dialysis catheters removed after each dialysis session. A vascular surgeon was unavailable. The urea reduction ratio was 45.38.6% (U.S.A target: 65%). The cost of the first dialysis session at JUTH is $160. With reuse of dialysis supplies, including dialyzers, dialysis tubing, femoral catheters, and guide wires, the cost of each subsequent dialysis session is $33. The minimal cost of dialysis with 3 dialysis sessions weekly and a new dialyzer every week is $501 per month. The cost of dialysis is borne exclusively by the patient. For comparison, average monthly income is $74 for unskilled laborers, $222 for dialysis technicians, $296 for dialysis nurses, and $889 for academic nephrologists. The low dose of dialysis has adverse effects on patient quality of life (frequent admissions with uremia). Despite notable exceptions (2 patients on dialysis for 12 and 9 years, respectively), survival of dialysis patients at JUTH appears to be poor. Conclusions:? Underdialysis is frequent in Nigeria and is the consequence of socioeconomic conditions and technologic deficits. Removal of the economic burden of dialysis from the patients with ESRD is the first logical step toward correction of underdialysis.

AB  - Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) frequently occurs in hemodialysis (HD) patients. But, clinical characteristics of UGIB in HD patients are not well reported yet. Objective:? This study was designed to compare the clinical characteristics of UGIB between HD patients and normal population with intact renal function. Methods:? This study enrolled 24 HD patients with UGIB. Age- and sex-matched 26 patients with UGIB and normal renal function were selected as control group during the same period. Of the cases with UGIB, esophageal variceal bleedings due to liver cirrhosis were excluded in this study. We investigated the results of treatment and UGIB-associated mortality for 3 months after the event and then compared previous gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (Sx), endoscopic findings, treatment results, and mortality between HD patients and control. Results:? The results are summarized in the table. HD patients (n?=?24) Control (n?=?26) p value Age (years) 60±11 61±11 0.702 Sex [male/female (%)] 62.5/37.5 53.8/46.2 0.536 Previous GI Sx ??[asymptomatic/??symptomatic (%)] 33.3/66.7 65.3/34.7 0.024 Endoscopic diagnosis ??[vascular ectasia/others (%)] 45.8/54.2 15.3/84.7 0.020 Primary treatment ??[endoscopic/medical (%)] 70.8/29.2 61.5/38.5 0.488 Results of treatment ?Success/rebleeding (%) 75.0/25.0 92.4/7.6 0.095 ?Patient survival/UGIB- ??related death (%) 83.3/16.7 100/0 0.046 Conclusion:? Previous gastrointestinal symptoms were less frequent in HD patients than normal population with intact renal function. In contrast, HD patients had higher incidence of vascular ectasia and mortality than normal population with intact renal function.

AB  - Survival has been defined as an index of adequacy of dialysis. These hard data are the basis for comparing results obtained by different schedules or policies. The aim of the study was to assess mortality rate recorded within a system of tailored dialysis (1?6 dialysis per week in out-of-hospital settings: home hemodialysis, self- and limited care dialysis). Data recorded in a single center (1998?2003) were compared with data gathered in the Registry of Dialysis and Transplantation in the whole Region (1998?2000). Methods:? Out-of-hospital dialysis unit is active since 1971, in which a new program integrating self- and limited care and home dialysis started since 1998. Patients:? Incident dialysis patients starting renal replacement therapy within the program and all further patients starting dialysis in the Region in the same period were compared in an historical prospective cohort study. Results:? 55 patients in the Unit and further 1443 patients in the whole Region started RRT since 1998. Main features of 55 patients were 32 males 23 females; median age 51 years, range 20?76; 72.7% displaying at least 1 comorbid factor. Throughout the period gross mortality rate was 4/125 patient-years in the Center. Kaplan?Meier curves showed a 1-year survival of 100% vs. 91%, respectively, in the Center and in the whole Region, and a 2-year survival of 95.5% vs. 76.6%, respectively, in the Center and in the whole Region (p?=?0.001). The main demographic features were remarkably different in both settings (for the whole Region median age 66 years, range 2.2?101, at least 1 comorbidity in 56.9% of patients). In an attempt to correct for the different baseline characteristics, a multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed. The whole model resulted in statistically significant value (p?=?0.000) and an increasing mortality risk resulted for age at starting dialysis, diabetes, and collagenopathy. In conclusion, tailored, high-efficiency dialysis policy may allow superior survival results. A longer follow up is needed to confirm our approach; in larger cohorts, the finding of a low mortality rate in a relatively young population with high comorbidity may underline the need to review our current concepts on dialysis adequacy.

AB  - One of the main symptoms of terminal-stage chronic renal insufficiency is anemia. One of the best applicable methods correcting anemia is using recombinant human erythropoietin preparation. Using recombinant human erythropoietin in patients with terminal-stage chronic renal insufficiency in 90?95% of events had a positive effect, but 5?10% of patient had refraction to erythropoietin, which has spurred the search for new efficient methods correcting anemia. The purpose of the study was to determine the influence of the laser on erythropoiesis and blood acid?alkaline condition (pH) in patients with terminal-stage chronic renal insufficiency. In the course of the study, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, reticulocytes in blood, and blood acid?alkaline condition (pH) were determined. At the beginning of the treatment, all hematological parameters 5 and 15 days after marrow stimulation were defined. 15 days after marrow stimulation with laser, increasing amounts of erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were observed. The initial erythrocyte count was 2.22?±?0.1???1012/L, hemoglobin 67.7?±?3.2?g/L and hematocrit 18.2?±?1.2%. During the laser treatment, erythrocyte count increased up to 2.9?±?0.8???1012/L, hemoglobin up to 89.6?±?2.9?g/L and hematocrit up to 28.2?±?1.3% (p?<?0005).

AB  - The establishment and maintenance of vascular access in end-stage renal disease provides a greater challenge. Adequate dialytic therapy requires reliable, long-term access to the blood circulation. Vascular access remains the Achilles' heel of chronic hemodialysis; complications are costly for the patient and society. Vascular access failure is the most frequent cause of hospitalization for patients with chronic renal disease. The general goal was to prevent thrombectomies, thus preventing hospitalizations and reducing cost, and most importantly, saving the patient's access and increasing the survival rate of the graft or fistula. A protocol to evaluate the vascular accesses at the dialysis centers where our patients are dialyzing was implemented. The patients are evaluated before their dialysis treatments, every 2 months if they have a graft and every other visit (4 months) if they have a fistula. New patients will be evaluated every visit by the vascular technician. The protocol (US Vascular Access Protocol) also has attention parameters and depth considerations. The attention parameters refers to blood flows and reductions in size. For example, for a fistula, a normal flow will be 400?mL/min or above, an alert value will be 390?mL/min or below, and a reduction in size of 1.9?mm or below will also be an alert value for the fistula (Table?I). Depth considerations relate to how deep the access is, for example 2?3?mm is ideal to cannulate, 8?mm and above make cannulation impossible (Table?II). Patients with vascular problems are then referred to the vascular surgeon or, as mostly, are referred to interventional radiology. We have found that these Doppler reports are very accurate, and after almost a year, doing these tests at the dialysis center, many accesses have been saved, and dialysis quality has improved in those patients by resolving issues causing re-circulation, stenosis, etc. In conclusion, we need to continue evaluating this program, but the preliminary reports show that by using the Doppler studies prophylactically, dialysis accesses can be saved or their use prolonged, thereby saving costs and reducing the need for future sites for the patient. And, in some cases, improving dialysis adequacy. 1 Attention parameters Normal values Alert values Fistula Access volume flow (mL/min) ≥400 ?0?390 Reductions (mm) ≥2.0 ?0?1.9 Graft Access volume flow (mL/min) ≥600 ?0?590 Reductions (%) 0?49 50?100 2 Depth considerations 2?3?mm Ideal and easy to cannulate 4?5?mm Is acceptable 6?7?mm Increases difficulty of cannulation and increases vessel wall damage ≥8?mm Makes cannulation difficult-to-impossible, causes significant wall damage and infiltrations, requires longer cannula

AB  - Background:? Hemodialyzers can be used once or reused after treatment with chemicals or hot water. SU results in infusion of plastic compounds, particularly phthalic acid metabolites, into patients and chemical reuse releases formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, or peracetic acid into the blood during dialysis. Methods:? We studied the increase in pulse rate (PR) and fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and patients' subjective overall quality evaluation (OE) of dialysis (1 worst, 5 best) during 3706 daily dialyses in 23 patients. Fall in blood pressure and rise in PR during dialysis and overall quality evaluation were compared as patients changed from SU or chemical reuse to hot water reuse. During SU and chemical reuse, dialysis time was shorter (121 vs. 148?min), urea clearance higher (241 vs. 175?ml/min) but ultrafiltration lower (1.5 vs. 1.7?kg/dialysis) than during hot water reuse. Results:? The results are summarized in the table. Methods n Systolic BP Diastolic BP PR OE CRU ??98 ?30?±?19 ?17?±?21 ???4?±?4 3.8?±?0.4 SU 2443 ?17?±?21 ??6?±?13 ???2?±?13 4.0?±?0.7 HWR 1165 ??8?±?21 ??1?±?11 ?0.2?±?12 4.2?±?0.7 All comparisons were of SU and chemical reuse to hot water reuse, p?<?0.0001. The results were the same whether cellulosic or polysulfone membranes were used. Hot water reuse, up to 25 times, did not result in changes in urea clearance, albumin leakage or Kuf, and ?-2-microglobulin reduction rates declined by only 10% over 15 reuses. Conclusion:? Hot water reuse results in the most comfortable dialysis and the best cardiovascular stability, with less decline in blood pressure and less tachycardia, when compared to chemical reuse or SU of dialyzers.

AB  - Objective:? To have 1 nurse successfully train 2 patients at a time for nightly home hemodialysis (NHHD) within a 7?10 week time period. Methods:? Over the past 6 years, Lynchburg Nephrology Dialysis Inc. has evolved its NHHD program from 1 nurse training 1 patient during an average 6 week period to training 2 patients in a 7?10 week period. Patients came either from our in-center population or directly from internal medicine. Our pre-evaluation procedures and manual were revised. Patients were pre-evaluated for literacy, manual dexterity, strength, hearing and visual deficits, substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and compliance before being accepted into the program. A home visit was made to evaluate their environment, family interactions, and water source. Our training manual was rewritten to fifth grade level. Every patient was given index cards printed in 20 size font with step-by-step procedures for machine setup, put-on and takeoff, re-circulation, and power failure. Patients were dialyzed 4 days/week to improve cognitive function and ?dialyzed the bucket? 1 day, thus training 5 days/week. One nurse trained 2 patients, staggering their start dates 2 weeks apart to allow for both individual and group teaching. Fistula or IJ catheter was used for access. Patients were trained alone or with a partner. In the last week of training, patients were dialyzed for 7?h and were expected to complete all procedures independently. Results:? From March 2003 to August 2003, 6 patients were trained for NHHD. 2 patients finished training in 7 weeks, 2 in 9 weeks, and 2 in 10 weeks. Conclusion:? One nurse can successfully train 2 patients at a time for NHHD in a 7?10 week time period at a decreased cost to dialysis provider.

AB  - Home hemodialysis (HHD) patients are often inconvenienced when intravenous iron preparations are administered. Formerly, these patients received their medication in the clinic on an off-dialysis day or during in-center hemodialysis (HD). For the last 2 years, 5 patients in our HHD program have been receiving intravenous ferric gluconate during their routine HD session. Procedure:? All patients were trained in the proper administration of ferric gluconate in-center. No test dose was administered. Ferric gluconate was infused via the heparin infusion pump on their HD machine at a rate of 31.25?mg/h. Doses were of either 62.5?mg or 125?mg per session. K/DOQI guidelines for intravenous iron use were adhered to. TSATs greater than 25%, ferritin greater than 100?ng/mL and less than 800?ng/mL, and hemoglobin between 11 and 12?g% were the goals of therapy. Both loading doses (8 doses during sequential HD sessions) and maintenance doses every week or every other week were employed. Results:? Over the last 2 years, 223 doses were administered at home. No serious reactions occurred during the course of therapy. One patient experienced minor nausea and vomiting during one dose, which was thought to be possibly related to the iron infusion. This patient subsequently received ferric gluconate again without difficulty. Conclusion:? Ferric gluconate can be safely administered at home during HHD.

AB  - Purpose:? Several studies have showed that nocturnal home hemodialysis (NHD, 6 times weekly 6?8?h) results in a better outcome. How do patients and their partners experience this very intensive treatment that has a great impact on daily life? Methods:? We followed a cohort of 12 patients (11 male, 1 female, mean age 46.8?±?9.4 years, time for renal replacement 11.3?±?9.4 years) and their partners during a year after starting NHD, using questionnaires and interviews and the SF-36. Results:? Both the physical and the mental components of the SF-36 showed an improvement in all aspects (p?<?0.05), even in this small group. All couples considered NHD a tremendous improvement over routine thrice weekly dialysis. The drawbacks (such as daily routine and the intrusion of the treatment in bed) are outweighed by the advantages (such as better clinical condition, less fatigue, less uremic symptoms, better quality of life, more time, and free diet). Following are a few comments on NHD: ?NHD is a difference of day and night,??NHD gave me independence,??Since I do NHD, I do aerobics,??I am becoming too fat now!,??My husband now is much faster than I am when we walk or ride the bicycle,??There is no reason now why I won't live long,??I got an excellent, but demanding new job, which is possible thanks to NHD,??Being a good team is a prerequisite for success,??Don't expect too much. You will remain a chronic patient,??Become confident with ?conventional? home hemodialysis first before you start NHD.? Conclusion:? NHD results in a tremendous improvement of quality of life. However, patients and partners need active support.

AB  - Background:? Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an important outcome of medical treatment effectiveness. Objectives:? Thirty-six item short-Form (SF-36) first has been used in hemodialysis (HD) patients in Taiwan. Method:? HRQOL was measured by using SF-36 in 497 HD patients in 5 hospitals. Results:? Male sex, age less than 50 years, higher education level (EL), marriage, employed status (EPS), less comorbid medical condition (CMC), and non-diabetic patients were all predicted a better physical component scale (PCS). Age less than 50 years, BMI greater than 18.5, HEL, EPS, and NDP were all predicted a higher mental component scale (MCS). Scales contributing to a summary measure of physical health, the PCS score, was significantly lower in women (35?±?12.3) than in men (37.9?±?12.3). There is no difference in MCS score between women and men. In multivariate analysis, age, CMC, diabetes, serum creatinine (SCr), and erythropoietin responsiveness were significant independent predictors of PCS. Diabetes, EL, SCr, and erythropoietic responsiveness were significant independent predictors of MCS. All of the individual scales, PCS and MCS scores were lower in the Taiwan HD patients than values for the US general population. Each of the individual scales and MCS scores were substantially lower in Taiwan HD group than in the US HD cohort. But the bodily pain of PCS was significantly higher in Taiwan HD group in spite of mean PCS scores for Taiwan HD group and US HD study participants were nearly equal at 36.3 and 36.1, respectively. Conclusion:? Physical and mental aspects of quality of life are substantially reduced among Taiwan HD patients, but higher bodily pain tolerance. A number of demographic and clinical characteristics significantly impact on HRQOL in Taiwan HD patients. To our knowledge, this is the first time we demonstrate the HRQOL by using SF-36 in Chinese HD patients.

AB  - Increased radial artery wall thickness (RAWT) is considered to be associated with early failure of radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) as well as coronary artery atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients. Therefore, exact measurement of RAWT by noninvasive method before the operation is very important. Objective:? This study was designed to evaluate accuracy of Doppler ultrasonography in measuring RAWT in hemodialysis patients. Methods:? This study enrolled 21 hemodialysis patients undergoing radiocephalic AVF operation for the first time. We measured RAWT (intima-media thickness) using high-resolution Doppler ultrasonography at the wrist before the AVF operation. We obtained specimens of the radial artery during the AVF operation and then measured RAWT by histologic examination. Results:? Mean age of the patients was 60?±?13 years and the number of females was 7 (33.3%). Mean values of RAWT measured by Doppler ultrasonography and histologic examination were 485?±?93??m (300?700??m) and 426?±?106??m (300?700??m), respectively. The value of RAWT of Doppler sonographic measurement well correlated with that of histologic measurement (r?=?0.800, p?<?0.001). Conclusion:? Our data suggest that Doppler ultrasonography is an effective tool in measuring RAWT in hemodialysis patients before AVF operation.

AB  - The influence of dialysis prescription on outcome is well established. Hemodialysis dose has been shown to have a distinct impact upon the morbidity and mortality rate in patients on regular treatment therapy. Hence, adequacy of dialysis should be guaranteed. New devices based in online conductivity measures have been developed to achieve an adequate dialysis dose. The aim of this study was to compare online conductivity monitor (OCM) with dialysis dose standard methods (Daugirdas Kt/V). 24 anuric patients were included in a cross-sectional study: 20.8% were diabetics, mean age 64.7?±?18.2 years; 16% females. Access blood were AVFi and the effective dialyzed blood flow was set at 350?mL/min, with recirculation <5%. BMI was 25.4?±?3.8?kg/m2 and body weight was 69.7?±?12?kg. All patients were dialyzed thrice weekly (245?±?21?min) with dialysis machine 4008H (Fresenius Medical Care) equipped with OCM monitor and the hollow fiber high-flux polysulfone membrane (HF-80 1.8?m2) and helixone (Fx-60, 1.6?m2). Dialysate flow was maintained at 500?mL/min, with standard dialysate liquid. Drug therapy was not varied. Each patient was subjected to OCM on midweek day, during 3 consecutive weeks on the same day that blood Kt/V samples were taken as well. Each patient got 3 OCM measurements and Kt/V samples. Data were processed and statistically analyzed with SPSS 11.0 software package. Kt/V OCM relation to other baseline characteristics was assessed by using contingency tables, t-tests, analysis of variance, and linear regression, as appropriate. All the tests were performed for a 0.05 significance level. Descriptives (n?=?24) Mean SD Age (year) ??64.75 ??18.243 Dry weight ??69.7125 ??12.01178 Interdialysis weight gain 2266.67 1016.673 BMI ??25.4155 ???3.83630 HD time ?245.21 ??21.340 OCM ???1.29921 ???0.201072 Daugirdas Kt/V ???1.3287 ???0.21043 Watson volume (L) ??36.833 ???6.3095 Linear regression analysis: Kt/V OCM relationship Variable Regression coefficient (?) r2 p Age (year) ?0.631 0.398 <0.001 Daugirdas Kt/V ?0.981 0.962 <0.001 BMI ?0.327 0.107 NS Watson volume (L) ?0.833 0.694 <0.001 The OCM option correlates well with Daugirdas Kt/V obtained from blood samples, in 96.2%, and provides a safe and accurate tool for hemodialysis, adding efficiency to dialysis adequacy monitoring in clinical practice. Also, OCM allows for an individualized dialysis dose. Furthers studies are required to evaluate its influence on patients' evolution.

AB  - Daily hemofiltration (D-HF) is a new treatment modality that shows unique solute removal characteristics and possibly provides high quality of life for patients with end-stage renal disease. Objective:? To evaluate solute-removal characteristics of D-HF by kinetic modeling analysis. Methods:? Five HD patients with normal 4?h???3 times/week were switched to D-HF (2?h???6 times/week). Ultrafiltration rates (QF) or small solute clearances were approximately 100?mL/min. All the necessary kinetic parameters were determined from patients' physical data and HD portion of the clinical measurements. The two-compartment kinetic model predicted the concentration changes after switching from normal HD to D-HF. Results:? Concentrations of small solutes such as urea?nitrogen (UN) increased, whereas that of ?2-microglobulin (?2-MG) decreased after switching from normal HD to D-HF (Figure?1). Predicted solute concentrations for UN as well as ?2-MG correlated well with the clinical results. The model predicted that QF?=?140?mL/min may be required for time-averaged concentration (TAC) of UN to be unchanged. The model also predicted that the 7-times/week D-HF may not increase the TAC of UN very much even after switching from normal HD to D-HF. Conclusion:? D-HF is suitable for removing larger solutes but may not be good enough for removing small solutes. A 7-day treatment (7 times/week) may greatly improve the solute removal capacity of the so-called daily treatment (6 times/week) not only for larger solutes but also for small solutes.

AB  - More frequent dialysis is thought to be associated with increased heparin requirements; however, limited data are available which compare heparin requirements of conventional to daily dialysis. Objectives:? To determine differences in heparin dose during conventional thrice-weekly dialysis (CHD) compared to daily hemodialysis (DHD). Methods:? All patients within the daily home hemodialysis at the Northwest Kidney Centers were evaluated for heparin dose both pre- and post initiation of daily hemodialysis. Patients on DHD received an initial bolus of heparin, without a continuous heparin drip, and supplemental heparin midway through the dialysis run as needed to maintain adequate activated clotting times (ACTs). CHD patients received a heparin bolus, followed by initiation of heparin drip as needed to maintain adequate ACTs. Results:? Of the 1117 patients who dialyze at the NKC, 55% were Caucasian, 21% African-American, 20% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 35% were of other ethnicity. The majority of patients were greater than 60 years (56%), while 36% ranged from 40?60 years and 13% ranged from 20?40 years. Male patients constituted 54% of patients. Diabetes was the primary cause of renal disease (36%), followed by hypertension (21%) and glomerular disease (18%). Of those patients in the home hemodialysis program (n?=?45), 10 patients started daily home hemodialysis using the Aksys daily home hemodialysis system. Of those, the majority was male (100%), Caucasian (78.8%) with an average age of 46.7?±?18 years. Glomerulonephritis was the primary cause of end-stage renal disease (40%), while the percentages of other diseases were similar [Alport's syndrome (20%), hypertension (20%) and diabetes (10%)]. Compared to initial DHD heparin requirements (10,111?±?2219 units), CHD heparin dose requirements (6833?±?2715 units) were significantly lower (p?=?0.045); however, total heparin needs were similar between groups (10,166?±?4380 units vs. 10,778?±?2959 units) (p?=?0.324). Conclusion:? Although patients initiating DHD have greater initial heparin requirements than when on CHD, total heparin doses remain similar to those required on conventional thrice-weekly hemodialysis. Greater initial heparin doses required during short daily dialysis appear safe compared to those of conventional dialysis.
