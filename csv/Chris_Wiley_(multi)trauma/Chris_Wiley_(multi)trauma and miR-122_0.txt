AB  - Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent degenerative joint disease with multifactorial etiology caused by risk factors. The degradation of aggrecan by upregulated ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) is the key event in the development of OA. ADAMTS-4 contributes to aggrecan degradation in human OA. Cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (Cyr61), which is associated with diseases related to chronic inflammation, is found in articular cartilage from patients with osteoarthritis and appears to suppress ADAMTS-4 activity, possibly leading to chondrocyte cloning. Herein, we first revealed that Cyr61 and ADAMTS-4 protein levels were remarkably increased in OA cartilage tissues and OA chondrocytes, and verified Cyr61 regulation of ADAMTS-4 in normal and OA chondrocyte. Further, we revealed that Cyr61 could promote OA chondrocyte proliferation through inhibiting ADAMTS-4. Overproduction of inflammatory cytokines plays a vital role in the pathological development of OA; herein, we demonstrated that IL-1? inhibited Cyr61, while promoted ADAMTS-4 expression. By using online tools and luciferase assays, we confirmed that miR-34a, a regulatory miRNA of chondrocyte proliferation, could directly bind to the 3?-UTR of Cyr61 to inhibit its expression; further, IL-1? regulated Cyr61 and ADAMTS-4 expression through miR-34a. In OA cartilage tissues, miR-34a, and IL-1? mRNA expression was up-regulated and positively correlated; miR-34a and Cyr61 mRNA was positively correlated, further indicating that suppressing miR-34a expression might rescue IL-1?-induced Cyr61 suppression, and promote OA chondrocyte proliferation. Taken together, we provided novel experimental basis for rescuing OA chondrocyte proliferation through miR-34a/Cyr61 axis.

AB  - Abstract Bone and tooth, fundamental parts of the craniofacial skeleton, are anatomically and developmentally interconnected structures. Notably, pathological processes in these tissues underwent together and progressed in multilevels. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-released small organelles and transfer proteins and genetic information into cells and tissues. Although EVs have been identified in bone and tooth, particularly EVs have been identified in the bone formation and resorption, the concrete roles of EVs in bone and tooth development and diseases remain elusive. As such, we review the recent progress of EVs in bone and tooth to highlight the novel findings of EVs in cellular communication, tissue homeostasis, and interventions. This will enhance our comprehension on the skeletal biology and shed new light on the modulation of skeletal disorders and the potential of genetic treatment.

AB  - Minors performing commercial sex acts are deemed victims of human trafficking according to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. However, prosecutors and judges continue to charge and adjudicate American minors as prostitution offenders instead of treating them as sexually exploited youths. These victims have typically suffered from sexual abuse, poverty, and other trauma and are especially vulnerable to pimps and traffickers. They suffer from physical and sexual violence, as well as psychological and emotional problems, thus deserving specialized social services in order to recover their lives. In order to stop the perpetuation and revictimization of sexually exploited youth, states should join the movement in passing Safe Harbor laws, modeled on existing New York law. The law presumes that minors charged with prostitution are victims and children in need of social services and allocates discretion in carefully defined circumstances when a judge concludes a minor charged with prostitution is not capable of rehabilitation by services alone. Key Points for the Family Court Community Several states have passed Safe Harbor legislation which functions to identify minors involved in prostitution as victims of commercial sexual exploitation. In order to best protect victims of sex trafficking, states should follow the progress made by New York and pass Safe Harbor statutes that will create a presumption of immunity for prostituted minors, thus providing discretion to allocate social services or order a juvenile delinquency petition depending on the circumstances of the case.
