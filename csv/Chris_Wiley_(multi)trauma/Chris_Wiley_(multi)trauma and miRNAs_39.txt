AB  - Introduction The utility of blood for genome-wide gene expression profiling and biomarker discovery has received much attention in patients diagnosed with major neuropsychiatric disorders. While numerous studies have been conducted, statistical rigor and clarity in terms of blood-based biomarker discovery, validation, and testing are needed. Methods We conducted a systematic review of the literature to investigate methodological approaches and to assess the value of blood transcriptome profiling in research on mental disorders. We were particularly interested in statistical considerations related to machine learning, gene network analyses, and convergence across different disorders. Results A total of 108 peripheral blood transcriptome studies across 15 disorders were surveyed: 25 studies used a variety of machine learning techniques to assess putative clinical viability of the candidate biomarkers; 11 leveraged a higher-order systems-level perspective to identify gene module-based biomarkers; and nine performed analyses across two or more neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Notably, ~50% of the surveyed studies included fewer than 50 samples (cases and controls), while ~75% included less than 100. Conclusions Detailed consideration of statistical analysis in the early stages of experimental planning is critical to ensure blood-based biomarker discovery and validation. Statistical guidelines are presented to enhance implementation and reproducibility of machine learning and gene network analyses across independent studies. Future studies capitalizing on larger sample sizes and emerging next-generation technologies set the stage for moving the field forwards. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Dexmedetomidine (Dex) protects different cell types during hypoxia or ischemia-reperfusion injury by inhibiting cell apoptosis. However, the underlying mechanism and its impact on hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury are still not known. In this study, we established a model of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) injury in hepatocyte HL7702 cells, and studied the impact of Dex on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle during OGD/R. In addition, we explored the role of CCAT1 in this process. We found that Dex increased cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis during OGD/R, in a concentration-dependent manner. Dex partially reversed the OGD-inhibited expression of lncRNA CCAT1. Knockdown of CCAT1 by siRNA inhibited Dex-mediated protection against OGD/R-induced injury and promoted cell apoptosis, caspase-3 expression and cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, and inhibited cell proliferation and cyclin D1 expression. In contrast, overexpression of CCAT1 by pcDNA3.0-CCAT1 enhanced Dex-mediated protection against OGD/R-induced cell injury. Thus, Dex protects hepatocytes against OGD/R injury by upregulating lncRNA CCAT1. This study suggests a novel role of CCAT1 in ischemia reperfusion injury, and lays the framework for future studies.

AB  - Abstract The newest laboratory method for modulating gene expression, RNA interference (RNAi), has gained rapid interest throughout the world of molecular research, and is being actively pursued as the next ?gene-targeted medicine.? RNAi is a process in which double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) directs the specific degradation of a corresponding target mRNA. This article describes the main ideas, approaches, and technological directions that may guide the medical researcher interested in using RNAi methodologies to identify and develop new drug candidates.

AB  - Summary Intellectual disability (ID) is a clinical manifestation of the central nervous system without any major dysmorphologies of the brain. Biologically it affects learning capabilities, memory, and cognitive functioning. The basic defining features of ID are characterized by IQ<70, age of onset before 18 years, and impairment of at least two of the adaptive skills. Clinically it is classified in a syndromic (with additional abnormalities) and a nonsyndromic form (with only cognitive impairment). The study of nonsyndromic intellectual disability (NSID) can best explain the pathophysiology of cognition, intelligence and memory. Genetic analysis in autosomal recessive nonsyndrmic ID (ARNSID) has mapped 51 disease loci, 34 of which have revealed their defective genes. These genes play diverse physiological roles in various molecular processes, including methylation, proteolysis, glycosylation, signal transduction, transcription regulation, lipid metabolism, ion homeostasis, tRNA modification, ubiquitination and neuromorphogenesis. High-density SNP array and whole exome sequencing has increased the pace of gene discoveries and many new mutations are being published every month. The lack of uniform criteria has assigned multiple identifiers (or accession numbers) to the same MRT locus (e.g. MRT7 and MRT22). Here in this review we describe the molecular genetics of ARNSID, prioritize the candidate genes in uncharacterized loci, and propose a new nomenclature to reorganize the mutation data that will avoid the confusion of assigning duplicate accession numbers to the same ID locus and to make the data manageable in the future as well.
