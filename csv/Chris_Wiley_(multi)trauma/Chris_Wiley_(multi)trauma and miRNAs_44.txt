AB  - Abstract Resolution of inflammation is a coordinated and active process aimed at restoration of tissue integrity and function. This review integrates the key molecular and cellular mechanisms of resolution. We describe how abrogation of chemokine signalling blocks continued neutrophil tissue infiltration and how apoptotic neutrophils attract monocytes and macrophages to induce their clearance. Uptake of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages reprograms macrophages towards a resolving phenotype, a key event to restore tissue homeostasis. Finally, we highlight the therapeutic potential that derives from understanding the mechanisms of resolution.

AB  - Summary Roots to Wings (RTW) is a transformative co-mentoring (TCM) health sciences education pathway that connects students, leaders, and faculty from the Pacific Northwest University of Health Sciences, Heritage University, Mt. Adams School District, and the Yakama Nation Tribal School. It is hoped that the expansion of RTW will educate, form, and shape interactions with other Tribal Nations and other health care professionals. The TCM program takes a comprehensive approach which seeks to enhance the educational opportunities of Native and Mexican American children living on tribal lands in the United States. There are some mentoring programs in medical schools across the United States which focuses on working with underrepresented youth. The teenagers expressed their gratitude for the opportunity to experience rich mentoring. The medical students' journey was made possible by the younger mentors who paved the way for the older mentors.

AB  - Abstract The differential diagnosis of a pancreatic head mass encompasses a wide range of clinical entities that include both solid and cystic lesions. This chapter focuses on our approach to the patient presenting with a newly found pancreatic head mass with the main goals of determining the risk of the lesion being malignant or premalignant, resectability if the patient is appropriate for surgical intervention, assessment of need for multimodality treatment and determination the patient's surgical risk.

AB  - Abstract EFSA received a request from the Hellenic Food Authority (EFET) for a scientific opinion on the risk to human health from the presence of nickel (Ni) in food, particularly in vegetables. The EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) decided to extend the risk assessment also to drinking water. The reproductive and developmental toxicity in experimental animals was selected as the critical effect for the assessment of chronic effects of Ni. A tolerable daily intake of 2.8 µg Ni/kg body weight (b.w.) per day was derived from a lower 95 % confidence limit for a benchmark dose at 10 % extra risk (BMDL10) of 0.28 mg/kg b.w. for post-implantation fetal loss in rats. The current dietary exposure to Ni raises concern when considering the mean and 95th percentile chronic exposure levels for all different age groups. The systemic contact dermatitis (SCD) elicited in Ni-sensitive humans after oral exposure to Ni was selected as the critical effect suitable for the assessment of acute effects of Ni. A lowest BMDL10 of 1.1 µg Ni/kg b.w. was derived for the incidence of SCD following oral exposure to Ni of human volunteers. The CONTAM Panel applied a margin of exposure (MOE) approach and considered an MOE of 10 to be indicative of a low health concern. The MOEs calculated considering the estimated mean and the 95th percentile acute exposure levels were considerably below 10 for all age groups. Overall, the CONTAM Panel concluded that, at the current levels of acute dietary exposure to Ni, there is a concern that Ni-sensitized individuals may develop eczematous flare-up skin reactions. The CONTAM Panel noted the need for mechanistic studies to assess the human relevance of the effects on reproduction and development observed in experimental animals and for additional studies on human absorption of nickel from food, for example in combination with duplicate diet studies.

AB  - Abstract The improvement of fat graft viability might depend on the presence of multipotent resident adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) which is the important component of stromal vascular fraction (SVF). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiogenin-1 (Ang-1) are responsible for neovascularization. However, their half-life is too short to produce a biological effect. We thus investigated whether VEGF-ANG-1-polylactic acid (PLA) microspheres could enhance the angiogenic properties of ADSCs. PLA microspheres containing VEGF and ANG-1 were prepared by in vitro ultrasonic emulsification and characterized according to their encapsulation efficiency (EE), drug-loading rate (DL), particle size, and drug release. The systemic toxicity of empty loaded nanospheres (NPs) and the ability of these microspheres to promote the proliferation and differentiation of ADSCs were evaluated. The EE and DL were above 86 and 2.8%, respectively. The drug release was completed after 20 days. Systemic toxicity was verified in ADSCs that received the unloaded NPs. It was observed that ADSCs treated with VEGF-ANG-1-PLA microspheres had an increase in the proliferation and the number of CD31 positive cells. ADSCs proliferation and differentiation toward endothelial cells (ECs) could be enhanced by the addition of VEGF-ANG-1-PLA nano-sustained release microspheres.
