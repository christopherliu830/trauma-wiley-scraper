AB  - Summary This chapter deals primarily with the three most economically important virus-induced transmissible neoplastic diseases of poultry, namely herpesvirus-induced Marek's disease (MD), and retrovirus-induced avian leukoses/sarcoma (L/S) and reticuloendotheliosis. It covers tumors of unknown etiology. The morphology and morphogenesis of MD virus have been reviewed. Several different types of MD vaccines are in common use, both individually and in various combinations. The most widely used products are low-pathogenic serotype 1 MDV, naturally avirulent herpesvirus of turkey (HVT), and serotype 2 viruses. Lymphoid leukosis (LL) has been the most common form of L/S group of diseases seen in field flocks, although myeloid leukosis has become prevalent. LL, a lymphoproliferative disease of chickens affecting primarily the cloacal bursa (bursa of Fabricius) and visceral organs, is the most common form of leukosis that arises from infection with avian leukosis virus (ALV). Eradication of ALV from primary breeding stocks is the most effective means for controlling ALV infection in chickens.

AB  - Summary Maternal protein malnutrition during the critical stages of development (pregnancy, lactation and first infancy) can lead to adult hypertension. Studies have shown that renal and cardiovascular dysfunctions can be associated to the development of hypertension in humans and rats exposed to maternal protein malnutrition. The etiology of hypertension, however, includes a complex network involved in central and peripheral blood pressure control. Recently, the hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system in protein-restricted rats has been reported. Studies have shown that protein malnutrition during pregnancy and/or lactation alters blood pressure control through mechanisms that include central sympathetic-respiratory dysfunctions and epigenetic modifications, which may contribute to adult hypertension. Thus, this review will discuss the historical context, new evidences of neurogenic disruption in respiratory-sympathetic activities and possible epigenetic mechanisms involved in maternal protein malnutrition induced- hypertension.

AB  - Summary Hongkong kumquat (Fortunella hindsii) is a wild citrus species characterized by dwarf plant height and early flowering. Here, we identified the monoembryonic F. hindsii (designated as ?Mini-Citrus?) for the first time and constructed its selfing lines. This germplasm constitutes an ideal model for the genetic and functional genomics studies of citrus, which have been severely hindered by the long juvenility and inherent apomixes of citrus. F. hindsii showed a very short juvenile period (~8 months) and stable monoembryonic phenotype under cultivation. We report the first de novo assembled 373.6 Mb genome sequences (Contig-N50 2.2 Mb and Scaffold-N50 5.2 Mb) for F. hindsii. In total, 32 257 protein-coding genes were annotated, 96.9% of which had homologues in other eight Citrinae species. The phylogenomic analysis revealed a close relationship of F. hindsii with cultivated citrus varieties, especially with mandarin. Furthermore, the CRISPR/Cas9 system was demonstrated to be an efficient strategy to generate target mutagenesis on F. hindsii. The modifications of target genes in the CRISPR-modified F. hindsii were predominantly 1-bp insertions or small deletions. This genetic transformation system based on F. hindsii could shorten the whole process from explant to T1 mutant to about 15 months. Overall, due to its short juvenility, monoembryony, close genetic background to cultivated citrus and applicability of CRISPR, F. hindsii shows unprecedented potentials to be used as a model species for citrus research.

AB  - Oral Diseases (2011) 17, 241?251 The rapid advancement in basic biology knowledge, especially in the stem cell field, has created new opportunities to develop biomaterials capable of orchestrating the behavior of transplanted and host cells. Based on our current understanding of cellular differentiation, a conceptual framework for the use of materials to program cells in situ is presented, namely a domino vs a switchboard model, to highlight the use of single vs multiple cues in a controlled manner to modulate biological processes. Further, specific design principles of material systems to present soluble and insoluble cues that are capable of recruiting, programming and deploying host cells for various applications are presented. The evolution of biomaterials from simple inert substances used to fill defects, to the recent development of sophisticated material systems capable of programming cells in situ is providing a platform to translate our understanding of basic biological mechanisms to clinical care.

AB  - 1 Elson L. So ( 1 Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN ) Some seizure disorders are known to be associated with excess mortality, and persons with epilepsy have been reported to have shorter life expectancies. Furthermore, concerted attention from both clinicians and researchers is needed to address the catastrophic condition of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). This program will identify epileptic conditions that are associated with increased risks for death, so that measures can be formulated and applied to reduce the risks. The necessity and the implications of counseling patients about the risk of SUDEP will also be discussed.
