AB  - Summary This chapter includes HGNC entries for proteins that are expressed on the cell surface, namely receptors for different ligand classes, transporters and ion channels. Targets for existing drugs are strongly over-represented in this group; for example, approximately 40% of current medicines affect G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and hundreds of these molecules are listed with annotations that indicate pharmaceutical potential. The chapter also discusses targets that involve protein-protein or protein-carbohydrate interactions. These are cytokines and their receptors, adhesion molecules and host defence molecules; the allocation of entries in these three sections is less clear-cut than with the GPCRs. The last group of entries that is discussed is the transporters and channels. The ATP-binding cassette and solute carrier families are not only primary therapeutic targets but also contain proteins that contribute to drug resistance.

AB  - Abstract In recent years, detection of cell-free tumour DNA (ctDNA) or liquid biopsy has emerged as an attractive noninvasive methodology to detect cancer-specific genetic aberrations in plasma, and numerous studies have reported on the feasibility of ctDNA in advanced cancer. In particular, ctDNA assays can capture a more ?global? portrait of tumour heterogeneity, monitor therapy response, and lead to early detection of resistance mutations. More recently, ctDNA analysis has also been proposed as a promising future tool for detection of early cancer and/or cancer screening. As the average proportion of mutated DNA in plasma is very low (0.4% even in advanced cancer), exceedingly sensitive techniques need to be developed. In addition, as tumours are genetically heterogeneous, any screening test needs to assay multiple genetic targets in order to increase the chances of detection. Further research on the genetic progression from normal to cancer cells and their release of ctDNA is imperative in order to avoid overtreating benign/indolent lesions, causing more harm than good by early diagnosis. More knowledge on the sources and elimination of cell-free DNA will enable better interpretation in older individuals and those with comorbidities. In addition, as white blood cells are the major source of cell-free DNA in plasma, it is important to distinguish acquired mutations in leukocytes (benign clonal haematopoiesis) from an upcoming haematological malignancy or other cancer. In conclusion, although many studies report encouraging results, further technical development and larger studies are warranted before applying ctDNA analysis for early cancer detection in the clinic.

AB  - Abstract In experimental models, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can modulate various immune responses implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into healthy subjects represents a model with relevance for the host response to sepsis. To explore the use of MSCs in sepsis, we determined their effect on the response to intravenous LPS in a randomized study in 32 healthy subjects with four treatment arms: placebo or allogeneic adipose MSCs (ASCs) intravenously at either 0.25 ? 106, 1 ? 106, or 4 ? 106 cells/kg; all subjects received LPS intravenously (2 ng/kg) one hour after the end of ASC infusion (Trial Register number 2014-002537-63, clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02328612). Infusion of ASCs was well tolerated. The high ASC dose increased the febrile response, exerted mixed pro-inflammatory (enhanced interleukin-8 and nucleosome release) and anti-inflammatory effects (increased interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-? release), and enhanced coagulation activation and reduced the fibrinolytic response. Blood leukocyte transcriptome analyses showed a biphasic effect of ASCs on the LPS response: at 2 hours post LPS, ASC-infused subjects displayed higher expression of genes involved in innate immune pathways, whereas at 4 hours post LPS these subjects had lower expression of innate immune pathway genes. Infusion of ASCs did not modify the ?ex vivo? responsiveness of whole blood to various bacterial agonists. These results indicate that intravenous infusion of allogeneic ASCs (4 ? 106 cells/kg) has a variety of proinflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and procoagulant effects during human endotoxemia. Further studies are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of ASCs in sepsis patients. Stem Cells 2018;36:1778?1788

AB  - Abstract BACKGROUND RNA interference (RNAi) techniques have emerged as powerful tools to develop novel management strategies for the control of insect pests. The leafhopper Euscelidius variegatus is a natural vector of chrysanthemum yellows phytoplasma and a laboratory vector of Flavescence dorée phytoplasma. Phytoplasmas are insect-borne bacterial plant pathogens that cause economically relevant crop losses worldwide. RESULTS In this study, we demonstrated that microinjection of muscle actin and ATP synthase ? double-stranded (ds)RNAs into adult insects caused an exponential reduction in the expression of both genes, which began within 72?h of dsRNA administration and lasted for 14 days, leading to almost complete silencing of the target genes. Such silencing effects on muscle actin expression appeared to be both time- and dose-dependent. Our results also showed that the knockdown of both genes caused a significant decrease in survival rates in comparison with green fluorescent protein (GFP) dsRNA-injected control insects. CONCLUSION The effectiveness of RNAi-based gene silencing in E. variegatus guarantees the availability of a powerful reverse genetic tool for the functional annotation of its genes and the identification of those potentially involved in the interaction with phytoplasmas. In addition, this study demonstrated that muscle actin and ATP synthase ? may represent candidate genes for RNAi-based control of E. variegatus. ? 2018 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Abstract The effect of stem cell transplantation in the treatment of neural lesions is so far not satisfactory. Magnetic stimulation is a feasible exogenous interference to improve transplantation outcome. However, the effect of magnetic stimulation on the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into neuron has not been studied. In this experiment, an in vitro neuron differentiation system from human iPSCs were established and confirmed. Three magnetic stimuli (high frequency [HF], low frequency [LF], intermittent theta-burst stimulation [iTBS]) were applied twice a day during the differentiation process. Immunofluorescence and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) were performed to analyze the effect of magnetic stimulation. Neural stem cells were obtained on day 12, manifested as floating neurospheres expressing neural precursor markers. All groups can differentiate into neurons while glial cell markers were not detected. Both Immunofluorescence and PCR results showed LF and iTBS increased the transcription and expression of neuronal nuclei (NeuN). HF significantly increased vesicular glutamate transporters2 transcription while iTBS promoted transcription of both synaptophysin and postsynaptic density protein 95. These results indicate that LF and iTBS can promote the generation of mature neurons from human iPSCs; HF may promote differentiate into glutamatergic neurons while iTBS may promote synapse formation during the differentiation.

AB  - Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are rare tumors of mesenchymal origin. About 50% of patients with STS experience relapse and more than 30% will die within 10 years after diagnosis. In this study we investigated circulating free DNA (cfDNA) and tumor-specific genetic alterations therein (circulating tumor DNA, ctDNA) as diagnostic biomarkers. Plasma concentrations and fragmentation of cfDNA was analyzed with quantitative PCR. Patients with STS (n?=?64) had significantly higher plasma concentrations and increased fragmentation of cfDNA when compared to patients in complete remission (n?=?19) and healthy controls (n?=?41) (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001). Due to overlapping values between patients with STS and controls, the sensitivity and specificity of these assays is limited. Sensitive assays to detect genomic alterations in cfDNA of synovial sarcomas (t(X;18)), myxoid liposarcomas (t(12;16) and TERT C228T promoter mutation) and well-differentiated/de-differentiated liposarcomas (MDM2 amplifications) were established. ctDNA was quantified in nine liposarcoma patients during the course of their treatment. Levels of breakpoint t(12;16) and TERT C228T ctDNA correlated with the clinical course and tumor burden in patients with myxoid liposarcomas (n?= 4). ctDNA could detect minimal residual disease and tumor recurrence. In contrast, detection of MDM2 amplifications was not sensitive enough to detect tumors in patients with well-differentiated/de-differentiated liposarcomas (n?= 5). Genotyping of cfDNA for tumor specific genetic alterations is a feasible and promising approach for monitoring tumor activity in patients with myxoid liposarcomas. Detection of ctDNA during follow-up examinations despite negative standard imaging studies might warrant more sensitive imaging (e.g. PET-CT) or closer follow-up intervals to timely localize and treat recurrences.

AB  - Summary To investigate the mechanisms behind psychopathologies that are the result of a myriad of genes, cells, neuronal circuits and their way of communicating with each other, animal models that resemble one core aspect or core symptom of a given disorder are required. Therefore, we focused on anxiety, namely anxiety-related behaviors, a core symptom of anxiety disorders. Every animal exhibits anxiety, as it is an essential part of evolution and an individual's decision of ?fight or flight? in a given situation might be the last decision it ever takes. Our HAB/LAB mouse and rat models of inborn trait anxiety focused on the following points, first to breed the animals with selection pressure exerted on extremely high vs. extremely low anxiety, then to genetically fix this trait by inbreeding. Following this, we could start to examine what lies behind the respective behavior, what kind of behaviors are associated with it and next, which brain circuitries, molecules, genes and gene products differ between our animal lines to bring about this inborn behavior. Finally, we investigated the impact of environmental factors on genetically (seemingly) rigid anxiety-related behaviors in order to evaluate gene-environment interactions, which brought us from gene analyses to the study of epigenetic mechanisms related to the regulation of anxiety.
